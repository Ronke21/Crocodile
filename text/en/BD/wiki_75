<text>Giuseppe Gasparo Mezzofanti (17 September 1774 – 15 March 1849) was an Italian cardinal known for being a hyperpolyglot.

== Life ==
Born in Bologna, he showed exceptional mnemonic, musical, and language learning skills from a young age. He studied with the Piarists, where he met several missionaries from various countries. By speaking with them he began learning several new languages including Swedish, German, Spanish, and languages of Indigenous peoples of South America, as well as studying Latin and Ancient Greek in school. He completed his theological studies before he had reached the minimum age for ordination as a priest. In 1797 he was ordained and became professor of Arabic, Hebrew, languages of Asia, and Greek at the University of Bologna. The same year, Mezzofanti tutored the eldest son of Georgiana Hare-Naylor.

Mezzofanti lost his university position for refusing to take the oath of allegiance required by the Cisalpine Republic, which governed Bologna at the time. Between 1799 and 1800 he visited many foreign people who had been wounded during the Napoleonic Wars to attend to them and started to learn other European languages.

In 1803, he was appointed assistant librarian of the Institute of Bologna, and soon afterwards was reinstated as professor of Oriental languages and Ancient Greek. The chair of Oriental languages was suppressed by the viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais in 1808, but again rehabilitated on the restoration of Pope Pius VII in 1814. Mezzofanti held this post until he went to Rome in 1831 as a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (&quot;Congregatio de Propaganda Fide&quot;), the Catholic Church&#x27;s governing body for missionary activities.

In 1833, he succeeded Angelo Mai as Custodian-in-Chief of the Vatican Library, and in 1838 was made cardinal of Sant&#x27;Onofrio and director of studies in the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. His other interests included ethnology, archaeology, numismatics, and astronomy.

== Polyglossia ==

Various anecdotal reports claim that Mezzofanti knew, to varying degrees, dozens of languages. The precise number of languages known to Mezzofanti is uncertain, as is the degree and extent of his abilities in them. Mezzofanti&#x27;s nephew gave a list of 114 languages. The 1858 biography of Mezzofanti written by Catholic clergyman Charles Russell gives a list of seventy-two languages, ordered into four categories by degree of proficiency; of these thirty languages nine are claimed to have been &quot;frequently tested, and spoken with rare excellence&quot;, while another nine were claimed to have been &quot;spoken fluently, but hardly sufficiently tested&quot;. A further eleven were categorized as &quot;spoken rarely, and less perfectly&quot;, eight as &quot;spoken imperfectly ; a few sentences and conversational forms&quot; and a final fourteen as &quot;studied from books, but not known to have been spoken&quot;.

However, scholars have cast doubt on the veracity of such reports. Even in Russell&#x27;s own time, his estimation of Mezzofanti&#x27;s abilities were criticized as exaggerations by fellow polyglot Thomas Watts, who estimated the number of languages Mezzofanti knew to about 60 or 61, a figure Russell later ended up agreeing with if one discounts languages in which the cardinal had only a very basic knowledge and some vocabulary. It has been suggested that some reports of Mezzofanti&#x27;s abilities may have had a hagiographical character, comparable to claims that certain Catholic saints could perform miracles such as levitation or bilocation. Additionally, the particular figure of &quot;seventy-two languages&quot; that Russell gives has religious significance, as the purported number of languages that resulted from the fall of the Tower of Babel, and thus may have been artificially selected for that reason. Linguists have also pointed out that lay people (i.e. non-linguists) frequently misunderstand what true language proficiency entails, or underestimate the difficulty in acquiring and maintaining it, and thus caution against reading contemporary accounts of Mezzofanti&#x27;s abilities uncritically. Furthermore, in Mezzofanti&#x27;s era, an individual&#x27;s proficiency in a language would likely have been gauged largely on the basis of their capacity for the receptive or passive skills of reading and translation, rather than by the more exacting standard of oral proficiency that is typically expected today. Additionally, Mezzofanti&#x27;s duties as a cardinal who engaged with foreign dignitaries would have largely involved the use of a small set of canned phrases, the use of which do not necessarily indicate actual linguistic fluency.

The surviving papers from Mezzofanti&#x27;s collection of documents have been found to contain texts about or in at least 56 languages, variously in Mezzofanti&#x27;s hand or written by others, which Mezzofanti had presumably collected for learning purposes. Such documents include word lists, parallel texts, and linguistic descriptions (e.g. grammar). These records suggest that Mezzofanti had at least some knowledge of dozens of languages, though the exact degree and extent of his abilities cannot be known.

Mezzofanti himself was known to respond modestly when asked about his linguistic abilities humbly, saying &quot;What am I but an ill-bound dictionary?&quot;

<text>Edmond Dehault de Pressensé (7 January 18248 April 1891) was a French Protestant religious leader.

==Biography==
He was born at Paris, and studied at Lausanne under Alexandre Vinet. He went on to the University of Halle as a pupil of Friedrich August Tholuck and to Humboldt University in Berlin, where he studied under August Neander. In 1847 he became a pastor in the Evangelical Church at the chapel of Taitbout in Paris.

He was a powerful preacher and political orator; from 1871 he was a member of the National Assembly, and from 1883 a life senator. In 1890 he was elected a member of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques. Pressensé laboured for the revival of biblical studies. He contended that the Evangelical Church ought to be independent of the power of the state.

His son Francis de Pressensé was a French politician and man of letters.

== Published works ==
In 1854 he founded the &quot;Revue chrétienne&quot;, and in 1866 the &quot;Bulletin idéologique&quot;. His works include:
* &quot;L&#x27;Immaculée conception: histoire d&#x27;un dogme Catholique-Roman&quot; (1855)

<text>Creative nonfiction (also known as literary nonfiction, narrative nonfiction, literary journalism or verfabula) is a genre of writing that uses literary styles and techniques to create factually accurate narratives. Creative nonfiction contrasts with other non-fiction, such as academic or technical writing or journalism, which are also rooted in accurate fact though not written to entertain based on prose style. Many writers view creative nonfiction as overlapping with the essay.

== Characteristics and definition ==
For a text to be considered creative nonfiction, it must be factually accurate, and written with attention to literary style and technique. Lee Gutkind, founder of the magazine &quot;Creative Nonfiction&quot;, writes, &quot;Ultimately, the primary goal of the creative nonfiction writer is to communicate information, just like a reporter, but to shape it in a way that reads like fiction.&quot; Forms within this genre include memoir, diary, travel writing, food writing, literary journalism, chronicle, personal essays, and other hybridized essays, as well as some biography and autobiography. Critic Chris Anderson claims that the genre can be understood best by splitting it into two subcategories—the personal essay and the journalistic essay—but the genre is currently defined by its lack of established conventions.

Literary critic Barbara Lounsberry in her book, &quot;The Art of Fact&quot;, suggests four constitutive characteristics of the genre: the first is &quot;Documentable subject matter chosen from the real world as opposed to &#x27;invented&#x27; from the writer&#x27;s mind&quot;. By this, she means that the topics and events discussed in the text verifiably exist in the natural world. The second characteristic is &quot;Exhaustive research&quot;, which she claims allows writers &quot;novel perspectives on their subjects&quot; and &quot;also permits them to establish the credibility of their narratives through verifiable references in their texts&quot;. The third characteristic that Lounsberry claims is crucial in defining the genre is &quot;The scene&quot;. She stresses the importance of describing and revivifying the context of events in contrast to the typical journalistic style of objective reportage. The fourth and final feature she suggests is &quot;Fine writing: a literary prose style&quot;. &quot;Verifiable subject matter and exhaustive research guarantee the nonfiction side of literary nonfiction; the narrative form and structure disclose the writer&#x27;s artistry; and finally, its polished language reveals that the goal all along has been literature.&quot; Essayist and critic Phillip Lopate describes &#x27;reflection&#x27; as a necessary element of the genre, offering the advice that the best literary nonfiction &quot;captures the mind at work&quot;.

Creative nonfiction may be structured like traditional fiction narratives, as is true of Fenton Johnson&#x27;s story of love and loss, &quot;Geography of the Heart&quot;, and Virginia Holman&#x27;s &quot;Rescuing Patty Hearst&quot;. When book-length works of creative nonfiction follow a story-like arc, they are sometimes called &quot;narrative nonfiction&quot;. Other books, such as Daniel Levitin&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Brain on Music&quot; and &quot;The World in Six Songs&quot;, use elements of narrative momentum, rhythm, and poetry to convey a literary quality. Creative nonfiction often escapes traditional boundaries of narrative altogether, as happens in the bittersweet banter of Natalia Ginzburg&#x27;s essay, &quot;He and I&quot;, in John McPhee&#x27;s hypnotic tour of Atlantic City, &quot;In Search of Marvin Gardens&quot;, and in Ander Monson&#x27;s playful, experimental essays in &quot;Neck-Deep and Other Predicaments&quot;.

Creative nonfiction writers have embraced new ways of forming their texts—including online technologies—because the genre leads itself to grand experimentation. Dozens of new journals have sprung up—both in print and online—that feature creative nonfiction prominently in their offerings.

== Ethics and accuracy ==

Writers of creative or narrative non-fiction often discuss the level, and limits, of creative invention in their works and the limitations of memory to justify the approaches they have taken to relating true events. Melanie McGrath, whose book &quot;Silvertown&quot;, an account of her grandmother&#x27;s life, is &quot;written in a novelist&#x27;s idiom&quot;, writes in the follow-up, &quot;Hopping&quot;, that the known facts of her stories are &quot;the canvas on to which I have embroidered. Some of the facts have slipped through the holes—we no longer know them nor have any means of verifying them—and in these cases I have reimagined scenes or reconstructed events in a way I believe reflects the essence of the scene or the event in the minds and hearts of the people who lived through it. ... To my mind this literary tinkering does not alter the more profound truth of the story.&quot; This concept of fact vs. fiction is elaborated upon in Brenda Miller and Suzanne Paola&#x27;s book &quot;Tell It Slant&quot;. Nuala Calvi, authors of &quot;The Sugar Girls&quot;, a novelistic story based on interviews with former sugar-factory workers, make a similar point: &quot;Although we have tried to remain faithful to what our interviewees have told us, at a distance of over half a century many memories are understandably incomplete, and where necessary we have used our own research, and our imaginations, to fill in the gaps. ... However, the essence of the stories related here is true, as they were told to us by those who experienced them at first hand.&quot;

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, there have been several well-publicized incidents of memoir writers who exaggerated or fabricated certain facts in their work. For example:
*In 1998, Swiss writer and journalist Daniel Ganzfried revealed that Binjamin Wilkomirski&#x27;s memoir &quot;Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood&quot;, detailing his experiences as a child survivor of the Holocaust, contained factual inaccuracies.
*The James Frey controversy hit in 2006, when &quot;The Smoking Gun&quot; website revealed that Frey&#x27;s memoir, &quot;A Million Little Pieces&quot;, contained experiences that turned out to be fabrications.
*In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; featured an article about the memoirist Margaret Seltzer, whose pen name is Margaret B. Jones. Her publisher, Riverhead Books, canceled the publication of Seltzer&#x27;s book, &quot;Love and Consequences&quot;, when it was revealed that Seltzer&#x27;s story of her alleged experiences growing up as a half-white, half-Native American foster child and Bloods gang member in South Central Los Angeles were fictitious.

Although there have been instances of traditional and literary journalists falsifying their stories, the ethics applied to creative nonfiction are the same as those that apply to journalism. The truth is meant to be upheld, just told in a literary fashion. Essayist John D&#x27;Agata explores the issue in his 2012 book &quot;The Lifespan of a Fact&quot;. It examines the relationship between truth and accuracy, and whether it is appropriate for a writer to substitute one for the other. He and fact-checker Jim Fingal have an intense debate about the boundaries of creative nonfiction, or &quot;literary nonfiction&quot;.

== Literary criticism ==
There is very little published literary criticism of creative nonfiction works, despite the fact that the genre is often published in respected publications such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. A handful of the most widely recognized writers in the genre such as Robert Caro, Gay Talese, Joseph Mitchell, Tom Wolfe, John McPhee, Joan Didion, John Perkins, Ryszard Kapuściński, Helen Garner and Norman Mailer have seen some criticism on their more prominent works. &quot;Critics to date, however, have tended to focus on only one or two of each writer&#x27;s works, to illustrate particular critical point.&quot; These analyses of a few key pieces are . As the popularity of the genre continues to expand, many nonfiction authors and a handful of literary critics are calling for more extensive literary analysis of the genre. The genre of the personal essay is periodically subject to predictions of its demise.

<text>Alexandre Rodolphe Vinet (17 June 17974 May 1847) was a Swiss literary critic and theologian.

==Literary critic==
He was born near Lausanne, Switzerland. Educated for the Protestant ministry, he was ordained in 1819, when already teacher of the French language and literature in the gymnasium at Basel; and throughout his life he was as much a critic as a theologian. His literary criticism brought him into contact with Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, for whom he obtained an invitation to lecture at Lausanne, which led to his famous work on Port-Royal.

Vinet&#x27;s &quot;Chrestomathie française&quot; (1829), his &quot;Études sur la littérature française au XIXme siècle&quot; (1840–51), and his &quot;Histoire de la littérature française au XVIIIme siècle&quot;, together with his &quot;Études sur Pascal&quot;, &quot;Études sur les moralistes aux XVIme et XVIIme siècles&quot;, &quot;Histoire de la prédication parmi les Réformés de France&quot; and other related works, gave evidence of a wide knowledge of literature, acute literary judgment and a distinguished faculty of appreciation. He adjusted his theories to the work under review, and condemned nothing as long as it met his literary standards.

==Theologian==
As a theologian Vinet gave a fresh impulse to Protestant theology, especially in French-speaking lands, but also in England and elsewhere. Lord Acton classed him with Richard Rothe. His philosophy relied strongly on conscience, defined as that by which man stands in direct personal relation with God as moral sovereign, and the seat of a moral individuality which nothing can rightly infringe. He advocated complete freedom of religious belief, and to this end the formal separation of church and state in &quot;Mémoire en faveur de la liberté des cultes&quot; (1826), &quot;Essai sur la conscience&quot; (1829), &quot;Essai sur la manifestation des convictions religieuses&quot; (1842).

Accordingly, when in 1845 the civil power in the canton of Vaud interfered with the church&#x27;s autonomy, he led a secession which took the name of &quot;L&#x27;Église libre&quot;. But already from 1831, when he published his &quot;Discours sur quelques sujets religieux&quot; (&quot;Nouveaux discours&quot;, 1841), he had begun to exert a liberalizing and deepening influence on religious thought far beyond his own canton, by bringing traditional doctrine to the test of a living personal experience (see also the philosophy of Gaston Frommel). In this he resembled Frederick William Robertson, as also in the change which he introduced into pulpit style and in the permanence of his influence.

Vinet died at Clarens, Vaud. A considerable part of his work was not printed till after his death.

<doc id="266430" wikidata="Q2097438" url="?curid=266430" title="Shaper">
<text>In machining, a shaper is a type of machine tool that uses relative motion between the workpiece and a single-point cutting tool to machine a linear toolpath. Its cut is analogous to that of a lathe, except that it is (archetypally) linear instead of helical.

A wood shaper is a functionally different woodworking tool, typically with a powered rotating cutting head and manually fed workpiece, usually known simply as a &quot;shaper&quot; in North America and &quot;spindle moulder&quot; in the UK.

A metalworking shaper is somewhat analogous to a metalworking planer, with the cutter riding a ram that moves relative to a stationary workpiece, rather than the workpiece moving beneath the cutter. The ram is typically actuated by a mechanical crank inside the column, though hydraulically actuated shapers are increasingly used. Adding axes of motion to a shaper can yield helical tool 
paths, as also done in helical planing.

== Process ==
A single-point cutting tool is rigidly held in the tool holder, which is mounted on the ram. The work piece is rigidly held in a vise or clamped directly on the table. The table may be supported at the outer end. The ram reciprocates and the cutting tool, held in the tool holder, moves forwards and backwards over the work piece. In a standard shaper, cutting of material takes place during the forward stroke of the ram and the return stroke remains idle. The return is governed by a quick return mechanism. The depth of the cut increments by moving the workpiece, and the workpiece is fed by a pawl and ratchet mechanism.

==Types==
Shapers are mainly classified as standard, draw-cut, horizontal, universal, vertical, geared, crank, hydraulic, contour and traveling head, with a horizontal arrangement most common. Vertical shapers are generally fitted with a rotary table to enable curved surfaces to be machined (same idea as in helical planing). The vertical shaper is essentially the same thing as a slotter (slotting machine), although technically a distinction can be made if one defines a true vertical shaper as a machine whose slide can be moved from the vertical. A slotter is fixed in the vertical plane

==Operation==
The workpiece mounts on a rigid, box-shaped table in front of the machine. The height of the table can be adjusted to suit this workpiece, and the table can traverse sideways underneath the reciprocating tool, which is mounted on the ram. Table motion may be controlled manually, but is usually advanced by an automatic feed mechanism acting on the feedscrew. The ram slides back and forth above the work. At the front end of the ram is a vertical tool slide that may be adjusted to either side of the vertical plane along the stroke axis. This tool-slide holds the &quot;clapper box &quot; and tool post, from which the tool can be positioned to cut a straight, flat surface on the top of the workpiece. The tool-slide permits feeding the tool downwards to deepen a cut. This flexibility, coupled with the use of specialized cutters and toolholders, enables the operator to cut internal and external gear teeth.

The ram is adjustable for stroke and, due to the geometry of the linkage, it moves faster on the return (non-cutting) stroke than on the forward, cutting stroke. This return stroke is governed by a quick return mechanism.

==Uses==
The most common use is to machine straight, flat surfaces, but with ingenuity and some accessories a wide range of work can be done. Other examples of its use are:
* Keyways in the hub of a pulley or gear can be machined without resorting to a dedicated broaching setup.
* Dovetail slides
* Internal splines and gear teeth.
* Keyway, spline, and gear tooth cutting in blind holes
* Cam drums with toolpaths of the type that in CNC milling terms would require 4- or 5-axis contouring or turn-mill cylindrical interpolation
* It is even possible to obviate wire EDM work in some cases. Starting from a drilled or cored hole, a shaper with a boring-bar type tool can cut internal features that do not lend themselves to milling or boring (such as irregularly shaped holes with tight corners).
* Smoothing of a rough surface

== History ==
Samuel Bentham developed a shaper between 1791 and 1793. However, Roe (1916) credits James Nasmyth with the invention of the shaper in 1836. Shapers were very common in industrial production from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th. In current industrial practice, shapers have been largely superseded by other machine tools (especially of the CNC type), including milling machines, grinding machines, and broaching machines. But the basic function of a shaper is still sound; tooling for them is minimal and very cheap to reproduce; and they are simple and robust in construction, making their repair and upkeep easily achievable. Thus, they are still popular in many machine shops, from jobbing shops or repair shops to tool and die shops, where only one or a few pieces are required to be produced, and the alternative methods are cost- or tooling-intensive. They also have considerable retro appeal to many hobbyist machinists, who are happy to obtain a used shaper or, in some cases, even to build a new one from scratch.

<doc id="266431" wikidata="Q59524" url="?curid=266431" title="McMahon–Hussein correspondence">
<text>The McMahon–Hussein correspondence is a series of letters that were exchanged during World War I, in which the government of the United Kingdom agreed to recognize Arab independence in a large region after the war in exchange for the Sharif of Mecca launching the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The correspondence had a significant influence on Middle Eastern history during and after the war; a dispute over Palestine continued thereafter.

The correspondence is composed of ten letters that were exchanged from July 1915 to March 1916 between Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca and Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner to Egypt. Whilst there was some military value in the Arab manpower and local knowledge alongside the British Army, the primary reason for the arrangement was to counteract the Ottoman declaration of &quot;jihad&quot; (&quot;holy war&quot;) against the Allies, and to maintain the support of the 70 million Muslims in British India (particularly those in the Indian Army that had been deployed in all major theatres of the wider war). The area of Arab independence was defined to be &quot;in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca&quot; with the exception of &quot;portions of Syria&quot; lying to the west of &quot;the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo&quot;; conflicting interpretations of this description were to cause great controversy in subsequent years. One particular dispute, which continues to the present, is the extent of the coastal exclusion.

Following the publication of the November 1917 Balfour Declaration (a letter written by British Foreign Secretary Arthur James Balfour to Baron Rothschild, a wealthy and prominent leader in the British Jewish community), which promised a national home for the Jews in Palestine, and the subsequent leaking of the secret 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement in which Britain and France proposed to split and occupy parts of the territory, the Sharif and other Arab leaders considered the agreements made in the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence violated. Hussein refused to ratify the 1919 Treaty of Versailles and, in response to a 1921 British proposal to sign a treaty accepting the Mandate system, stated that he could not be expected to &quot;affix his name to a document assigning Palestine to the Zionists and Syria to foreigners&quot;. A further British attempt to reach a treaty failed in 1923–24, with negotiations suspended in March 1924; within six months, the British withdrew their support in favour of their central Arabian ally Ibn Saud, who proceeded to conquer Hussein&#x27;s kingdom.

The correspondence &quot;haunted Anglo-Arab relations&quot; for many decades thereafter. In January 1923, unofficial excerpts were published by Joseph N. M. Jeffries in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and copies of the letters circulated in the Arab press. Excerpts were published in the 1937 Peel Commission Report and the correspondence was published in full in George Antonius&#x27;s 1938 book &quot;The Arab Awakening&quot;, then officially in 1939 as &quot;Cmd. 5957&quot;. Further documents were declassified in 1964.

== Background ==

=== Initial discussions ===
The first documented discussions between the UK and the Hashemites took place in February 1914, five months before the outbreak of World War I. Discussions were between the Consul-General in Egypt Lord Kitchener and Abdullah bin al-Hussein, the second son of Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca. Hussein had grown uncomfortable with the newly appointed Ottoman governor in his Hejaz Vilayet, Wehib Pasha, reflecting on rising tensions since the 1908 completion of the Hejaz railway, which threatened to support increased Ottoman centralization in the region. Discussions culminated in a telegram sent on 1 November 1914 from Kitchener—who had recently been appointed as Secretary of War—to Hussein wherein Great Britain would, in exchange for support from the Arabs of Hejaz, &quot;...guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Sharifate against all external foreign aggression, in particular, that of the Ottomans&quot;. The Sharif indicated he could not break with the Ottomans immediately but the entry of the Ottomans on Germany&#x27;s side in World War I on 11 November 1914 brought about an abrupt shift in British political interests concerning an Arab revolt against the Ottomans. According to historian David Charlwood, the failure in Gallipoli led to an increased desire on the part of the UK to negotiate a deal with the Arabs. Lieshout gives further background on the reasoning behind the shift in British thinking.

=== Damascus Protocol ===
On 23 May 1915, Emir Faisal bin Hussein—the third son of Hussein—was presented with the document that became known as the Damascus Protocol. Faisal was in Damascus to resume talks with the Arab secret societies al-Fatat and Al-&#x27;Ahd that he had met in March/April; in the interim he had visited Istanbul to confront the Grand Vizier with evidence of an Ottoman plot to depose his father. The document declared the Arabs would revolt in alliance with the United Kingdom and in return the UK would recognize Arab independence in an area running from the 37th parallel near the Taurus Mountains on the southern border of Turkey, to be bounded in the east by Persia and the Persian Gulf, in the west by the Mediterranean Sea and in the south by the Arabian Sea.

== Letters, July 1915 to March 1916 ==

Following deliberations at Ta&#x27;if between Hussein and his sons in June 1915, during which Faisal counselled caution, Ali argued against rebellion and Abdullah advocated action and encouraged his father to enter into correspondence with Sir Henry McMahon, over the period 14 July 1915 to 10 March 1916 ten letters—five from each side—were exchanged between Sir Henry McMahon and Sharif Hussein. McMahon was in contact with British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey throughout; Grey was to authorise and be ultimately responsible for the correspondence.

Historians have used an excerpt from a private letter sent on 4 December 1915 by McMahon halfway through the eight-month period of the correspondence as evidence of possible British duplicity:
[I do not take] the idea of a future strong united independent Arab State ... too seriously ... the conditions of Arabia do not and will not for a very long time to come, lend themselves to such a thing ... I do not for one moment go to the length of imagining that the present negotiations will go far to shape the future form of Arabia or to either establish our rights or to bind our hands in that country. The situation and its elements are much too nebulous for that. What we have to arrive at now is to tempt the Arab people into the right path, detach them from the enemy and bring them on to our side. This on our part is at present largely a matter of words, and to succeed we must use persuasive terms and abstain from academic haggling over conditions—whether about Baghdad or elsewhere.

The ten letters are summarised in the table below, from the letters published in full in 1939 as &quot;Cmd. 5957&quot;:

=== Legal status ===

Elie Kedourie said the October letter was not a treaty and that even if it was considered to be a treaty, Hussein failed to fulfil his promises from his 18 February 1916 letter. Arguing to the contrary, Victor Kattan describes the correspondence as a &quot;secret treaty&quot; and references &quot;The Secret Treaties of History&quot; that includes the correspondence. He also argues the UK government considered it to be a treaty during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference negotiations with the French over the disposal of Ottoman territory.

== Arab Revolt, June 1916 to October 1918 ==
McMahon&#x27;s promises were seen by the Arabs as a formal agreement between themselves and the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour represented the agreement as a treaty during the post-war deliberations of the Council of Four. On this understanding the Arabs, under the command of Hussein&#x27;s son Faisal, established a military force that fought, with inspiration from T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), against the Ottoman Empire during the Arab Revolt. In an intelligence memo written in January 1916 Lawrence described Sherif Hussein&#x27;s Arab Revolt as:

beneficial to us, because it marches with our immediate aims, the break up of the Islamic &#x27;bloc&#x27; and the defeat and disruption of the Ottoman Empire, and because &quot;the states [Sharif Hussein] would set up to succeed the Turks would be … harmless to ourselves&quot; … The Arabs are even less stable than the Turks. &quot;If properly handled they would remain in a state of political mosaic, a tissue of small jealous principalities incapable of cohesion&quot; (emphasis in original).

In June 1916, the Arab Revolt began when an Arab army moved against Ottoman forces. They participated in the capture of Aqabah and the severing of the Hejaz railway, a strategic link through the Arab peninsula that ran from Damascus to Medina. Meanwhile, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force under the command of General Allenby advanced into the Ottoman territories of Palestine and Syria. The British advance culminated in the Battle of Megiddo in September 1918 and the capitulation of the Ottoman Empire on 31 October 1918.

The Arab revolt is seen by historians as the first organized movement of Arab nationalism. It brought together Arab groups with the common goal to fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire for the first time. Much of the history of Arabian independence stemmed from the revolt beginning with the kingdom founded by Hussein. After the war was over, the Arab revolt had implications. Groups of people were classified according to whether they had fought in the revolt or and their ranks. In Iraq, a group of Sharifian officers from the Arab Revolt formed a political party of which they were head. The Hashemite kingdom in Jordan is still influenced by the actions of Arab leaders in the revolt.

== Related commitments, May 1916 to November 1918 ==

=== Sykes–Picot Agreement ===
The Sykes–Picot Agreement between the UK and France was negotiated from the end of November 1915 until its agreement in principle on 3 January 1916. The French government became aware of the UK&#x27;s correspondence with Hussein during December 1915 but were not aware formal commitments had been made.

The agreement was exposed in December 1917; it was made public by the Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution, showing the countries were planning to split and occupy parts of the promised Arab country. Hussein was satisfied by two disingenuous telegrams from Sir Reginald Wingate, who had replaced McMahon as High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him the British commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes–Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty.
After the Sykes-Picot Agreement was published by the Russian government, McMahon resigned.

Many sources contend the Sykes-Picot Agreement conflicted with the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916. There were several points of difference, the most obvious being that Persia was placed in the British area and less obviously, the idea British and French advisors would be in control of the area designated as an Arab State. While the correspondence does not mention Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and a reduced Palestine area was to be internationalized.

=== Balfour Declaration ===
In 1917, the UK issued the Balfour Declaration, promising to support the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. The declaration and the correspondence, as well as the Sykes-Picot agreement, are frequently considered together by historians because of the potential for incompatibility between them, particularly in regard to the disposition of Palestine. According to Albert Hourani, founder of the Middle East Centre at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, &quot;the argument about the interpretation of these agreements is one which is impossible to end, because they were intended to bear more than one interpretation&quot;.

=== Hogarth message ===
Hussein asked for an explanation of the Balfour Declaration and in January 1918 Commander David Hogarth, head of the Arab Bureau in Cairo, was dispatched to Jeddah to deliver a letter that was written by Sir Mark Sykes on behalf of the UK government to Hussein, who was now King of Hejaz. The Hogarth message assured Hussein &quot;the Arab race shall be given full opportunity of once again forming a nation in the world&quot; and referred to &quot; ... the freedom of the existing population both economic and political ...&quot;. According to Isaiah Friedman and Kedourie, Hussein accepted the Balfour Declaration while Charles D. Smith said both Friedman and Kedourie misrepresent documents and violate scholarly standards to reach their conclusions. Hogarth reported that Hussein &quot;would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain&quot;.

=== Declaration to the Seven ===
In light of the existing McMahon–Hussein correspondence and in the wake of the seemingly Zionist-favourable Balfour Declaration, as well as Russia&#x27;s publication weeks later of the older and previously secret Sykes–Picot Agreement with Russia and France, seven Syrian notables in Cairo from the newly formed Syrian Party of Unity (&quot;Hizb al-Ittibad as-Suri&quot;) issued a memorandum requesting clarification from the UK Government, including a &quot;guarantee of the ultimate independence of Arabia&quot;. In response, issued on 16 June 1918, the Declaration to the Seven stated that British policy was that the future government of the regions of the Ottoman Empire that were occupied by Allied forces in World War I should be based on the consent of the governed.

=== Allenby&#x27;s assurance to Faisal ===
On 19 October 1918, General Allenby reported to the UK Government that he had given Faisal:

official assurance that whatever measures might be taken during the period of military administration they were purely provisional and could not be allowed to prejudice the final settlement by the peace conference, at which no doubt the Arabs would have a representative. I added that the instructions to the military governors would preclude their mixing in political affairs, and that I should remove them if I found any of them contravening these orders. I reminded the Amir Faisal that the Allies were in honour bound to endeavour to reach a settlement in accordance with the wishes of the peoples concerned and urged him to place his trust whole-heartedly in their good faith.

===Anglo-French Declaration of 1918===

In the Anglo-French Declaration of 7 November 1918 the two governments stated that:
The object aimed at by France and the United Kingdom in prosecuting in the East the War let loose by the ambition of Germany is the complete and definite emancipation of the peoples so long oppressed by the Turks and the establishment of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the initiative and free choice of the indigenous populations.

According to civil servant Eyre Crowe, who saw the original draft of the Declaration, &quot;we had issued a definite statement against annexation in order (1) to quiet the Arabs and (2) to prevent the French annexing any part of Syria&quot;. The Declaration is considered by historians to have been misleading at best.

== Post-War outcome, 1919 to 1925 ==
===Sherifian Plan===
One day before the end of the war with the Ottomans, the British Foreign Office discussed T.E. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Sherifian Plan&quot;, in which Hussein&#x27;s sons were proposed as puppet monarchs in Syria and Mesopotamia. Part of the rationale was to satisfy a belief among the British public that a debt was owed to the Hashemites under the McMahon correspondence. Of Hussein&#x27;s sons, Faisal was Lawrence&#x27;s clear favourite, while Ali was not considered a strong leader; Zaid was considered to be too young, and Abdullah was considered to be lazy.

===Mandates===

The Paris Peace Conference between the allies to agree territorial divisions after the war was held in 1919. The correspondence was primarily relevant to the regions that were to become Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, Mesopotamia (Iraq) and the Arabian Peninsula. At the conference, Prince Faisal, speaking on behalf of King Hussein, did not ask for immediate Arab independence but recommended an Arab state under a British mandate.

On 6 January 1920, Prince Faisal initialed an agreement with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau that acknowledged &quot;the right of the Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation.&quot; A Pan-Syrian Congress, meeting in Damascus, declared an independent state of Syria on 8 March 1920. The new state included portions of Syria, Palestine and northern Mesopotamia, which under the Sykes–Picot Agreement had been set aside for an independent Arab state or confederation of states. Faisal was declared the head of state as king. The April 1920 the San Remo conference was hastily convened in response to Faisal&#x27;s declaration. At the conference, the Allied Supreme Council granted the mandates for Palestine and Mesopotamia to Britain, and those for Syria and Lebanon to France.

The United Kingdom and France agreed to recognize the provisional independence of Syria and Mesopotamia. Provisional recognition of Palestinian independence was not mentioned. France had decided to govern Syria directly and took action to enforce the French Mandate of Syria before the terms had been accepted by the Council of the League of Nations. The French intervened militarily at the Battle of Maysalun in June 1920, deposing the indigenous Arab government and removing King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. In Palestine, the United Kingdom appointed a High Commissioner and established their own mandatory regime. The January 1919 Faisal–Weizmann Agreement was a short-lived agreement for Arab–Jewish cooperation on the development of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which Faisal had mistakenly understood was to be within the Arab kingdom. Faisal did treat Palestine differently in his presentation to the Peace Conference on 6 February 1919, saying, &quot;Palestine, in consequence of its universal character, be left on one side for the mutual consideration of all parties concerned.&quot;

The agreement was never implemented. At the same conference, US Secretary of State Robert Lansing had asked Dr. Weizmann if the Jewish national home meant the establishment of an autonomous Jewish government. The head of the Zionist delegation had replied in the negative. Lansing was a member of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace at Paris in 1919; he said the system of mandates was a device created by the Great Powers to conceal their division of the spoils of war under the colour of international law. If the territories had been ceded directly, the value of the former German and Ottoman territories would have been applied to offset the Allies&#x27; claims for war reparations. He also said Jan Smuts had been the author of the original concept.

===Hussein&#x27;s downfall===
In 1919, King Hussein had refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. After February 1920, the British ceased to pay subsidy to him. In August 1920, five days after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, which formally recognized the Kingdom of Hejaz, Curzon asked Cairo to procure Hussein&#x27;s signature to both treaties and agreed to make a payment of £30,000 conditional on signature. Hussein declined and in 1921, stated that he could not be expected to &quot;affix his name to a document assigning Palestine to the Zionists and Syria to foreigners.&quot;

Following the 1921 Cairo Conference, Lawrence was sent to try and obtain the King&#x27;s signature to a treaty in exchange for a proposed £100,000 annual subsidy; this attempt also failed. During 1923, the British again tried to settle outstanding issues with Hussein; this attempt also failed and Hussein continued refusing to recognize any of the mandates he perceived as being his domain. In March 1924, having briefly considered the possibility of removing the offending article from the treaty, the UK government suspended negotiations and within six months withdrew support in favour of its central Arabian ally Ibn Saud, who proceeded to conquer Hussein&#x27;s kingdom.

==Territorial reservations and Palestine==
McMahon&#x27;s letter to Hussein dated 24 October 1915 declared Britain&#x27;s willingness to recognize the independence of the Arabs subject to certain exemptions. The original correspondence was conducted in both English and Arabic; slightly differing English translations are extant.

The correspondence was written first in English before being translated to Arabic and vice versa; the identity of the writer and translator is unclear. Kedourie and others assumed the likeliest candidate for primary author is Ronald Storrs. In his memoirs, Storrs said the correspondence was prepared by Husayn Ruhi and then checked by Storrs. The Arab delegations to the 1939 Conference had objected to certain translations of text from Arabic to English and the Committee arranged for mutually agreeable translations that would render the English text &quot;free from actual error&quot;.

===&quot;Portions of Syria&quot; debate===
The debate regarding Palestine arose because Palestine is not explicitly mentioned in the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence but is included within the boundaries that were initially proposed by Hussein. McMahon accepted the boundaries of Hussein &quot;subject to modification&quot; and suggested the modification that &quot;portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab and should be excluded&quot;. Until 1920, British government documents suggested that Palestine was intended to be part of the Arab area; their interpretation changed in 1920 leading to public disagreement between the Arabs and the British, each side producing supporting arguments for their positions based on fine details of the wording and the historical circumstances of the correspondence. Jonathan Schneer provides an analogy to explain the central dispute over the meaning:
Presume a line extending from the &quot;districts&quot; of New York, New Haven, New London, and Boston, excluding territory west from an imaginary coastal kingdom. If by &quot;districts&quot; one means &quot;vicinity&quot; or &quot;environs,&quot; that is one thing with regard to the land excluded, but if one means &quot;vilayets&quot; or &quot;provinces,&quot; or in the American instance &quot;states,&quot; it is another altogether. There are no states of Boston, New London, or New Haven, just as there were no provinces of Hama and Homs, but there is a state of New York, just as there was a &quot;vilayet&quot; of Damascus, and territory to the west of New York State is different from territory to the west of the district of New York, presumably New York City and environs, just as territory to the west of the &quot;vilayet&quot; of Damascus is different from territory to the west of the district of Damascus, presumably the city of Damascus and its environs.

More than 50 years after his initial report interpreting the correspondence for the British Foreign Office, Arnold J. Toynbee published his perspectives on the continuing academic debate. Toynbee set out the logical consequences of interpreting McMahon&#x27;s &#x27;districts&#x27; or &#x27;wilayahs&#x27; as provinces rather than vicinities:
(i) First alternative: McMahon was completely ignorant of Ottoman administrative geography. He did not know that the Ottoman vilayet of Aleppo extended westward to the coast, and he did not know that there were no Ottoman vilayets of Homs and Hama. It seems to me incredible that McMahon can have been as ill-informed as this, and that he would not have taken care to inform himself correctly when he was writing a letter in which he was making very serious commitments on HMG&#x27;s account.&lt;br&gt;
(ii) Second alternative: McMahon was properly acquainted with Ottoman administrative geography, and was using the word &#x27;wilayahs&#x27; equivocally. Apropos of Damascus, he was using it to mean &#x27;Ottoman provinces&#x27;; apropos of Homs and Hama, and Aleppo, he was using it to mean &#x27;environs&#x27;. This equivocation would have been disingenuous, impolitic, and pointless. I could not, and still cannot, believe that McMahon behaved so irresponsibly.

===&quot;Without detriment to France&quot; debate===
In the letter of 24 October, the English version reads: &quot; ... we accept those limits and boundaries; and in regard to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally France&quot; At a meeting in Whitehall in December 1920 the English and Arabic texts of McMahon&#x27;s correspondence with Sharif Husein were compared. As one official, who was present, said:

In the Arabic version sent to King Husain this is so translated as to make it appear that Gt Britain is free to act without detriment to France in the whole of the limits mentioned. This passage of course had been our sheet anchor: it enabled us to tell the French that we had reserved their rights, and the Arabs that there were regions in which they wd have eventually to come to terms with the French. It is extremely awkward to have this piece of solid ground cut from under our feet. I think that HMG will probably jump at the opportunity of making a sort of amende by sending Feisal to Mesopotamia.

James Barr wrote that although McMahon had intended to reserve the French interests, he became a victim of his own cleverness because the translator Ruhi lost the qualifying sense of the sentence in the Arabic version. In a Cabinet analysis of diplomatic developments prepared in May 1917 The Hon. William Ormsby-Gore, MP, wrote: 

Declassified British Cabinet papers include a telegram dated 18 October 1915 from Sir Henry McMahon to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Grey requesting instructions. McMahon described conversations with a Muhammed Sharif al-Faruqi, a member of the Abd party who said the British could satisfy the demands of the Syrian Nationalists for the independence of Arabia. Faroqi had said the Arabs would fight if the French attempted to occupy the cities of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, but he thought they would accept some modification of the north-western boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca. Based on these conversations, McMahon suggested the language; &quot;In so far as Britain was free to act without detriment to the interests of her present Allies, Great Britain accepts the principle of the independence of Arabia within limits propounded by the Sherif of Mecca&quot;. Lord Grey authorized McMahon to pledge the areas requested by the Sharif subject to the reserve for the Allies.

===Arab position===

The Arab position was that they could not refer to Palestine because that lay well to the south of the named places. In particular, the Arabs argued the &quot;vilayet&quot; (province) of Damascus did not exist and that the district (&quot;sanjak&quot;) of Damascus only covered the area surrounding the city and that Palestine was part of the &quot;vilayet&quot; of Syria A-Sham, which was not mentioned in the exchange of letters. Supporters of this interpretation also note that during the war, thousands of proclamations were dropped in all parts of Palestine carrying a message from the Sharif Hussein on one side and a message from the British Command on the other, saying &quot;that an Anglo-Arab agreement had been arrived at securing the independence of the Arabs&quot;.

===British position===

The undated memorandum GT 6185 (from CAB 24/68/86) of November 1918 was prepared by the British historian Arnold Toynbee in 1918 while working in the Political Intelligence Department. Crowe, the Permanent Under-Secretary, ordered them to be placed in the Foreign Office dossier for the Peace Conference. After arriving in Paris, General Jan Smuts required that the memoranda be summarized and Toynbee produced the document GT 6506 (maps illustrating it are GT6506A 
). The two last were circulated as E.C.2201 and considered at a meeting of the Eastern Committee (No.41) of the Cabinet on 5 December 1918, which was chaired by Lord Curzon, Jan Smuts, Lord Balfour, Lord Robert Cecil, General Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff; representatives of the Foreign Office, the India Office, the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Treasury were present. T. E. Lawrence also attended.

The Eastern Committee met nine times in November and December to draft a set of resolutions on British policy for the benefit of the negotiators. On 21 October, the War Cabinet asked Smuts to prepare the summarized peace brief and Smuts asked Erle Richards to carry out this task. Richards distilled Toynbee&#x27;s GT6506 and the resolutions of the Eastern Committee into a &quot;P-memo&quot; (P-49) for use by the Peace Conference delegates.

In the public arena, Balfour was criticized in the House of Commons when the Liberals and Labour Socialists moved a resolution &quot;That secret treaties with the allied governments should be revised, since, in their present form, they are inconsistent with the object for which this country entered the war and are, therefore, a barrier to a democratic peace&quot;. In response to growing criticism arising from the seemingly contradictory commitments undertaken by the United Kingdom in the McMahon-Hussein correspondence, the Sykes–Picot Agreement and the Balfour declaration, the 1922 Churchill White Paper took the position Palestine had always been excluded from the Arab area. Although this directly contradicted numerous previous government documents, those documents were not known to the public. As part of preparations for this White Paper, Sir John Shuckberg of the British Colonial Office had exchanged correspondence with McMahon; reliance was placed on a 1920 memorandum by Major Hubert Young, who had noted that in the original Arabic text, the word translated as &quot;districts&quot; in English was &quot;vilayets&quot;, the largest class of administrative district into which the Ottoman Empire was divided. He concluded &quot;district of Damascus&quot;, i.e., &quot;vilayet of Damascus&quot;, must have referred to the vilayet of which Damascus was the capital, the Vilayet of Syria. This vilayet extended southwards to the Gulf of Aqaba but excluded most of Palestine.


While some British government officials occasionally stated that the intent of the McMahon Correspondence was not to promise Palestine to Hussein, they have occasionally acknowledged the flaws in the legal terminology of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence that make this position problematic. The weak points of the government&#x27;s interpretation were acknowledged in a detailed memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1939.

A committee established by the British in 1939 to clarify the arguments said many commitments had been made during and after the war and that all of them would have to be studied together. The Arab representatives submitted a statement from Sir Michael McDonnell to the committee that said whatever meaning McMahon had intended was of no legal consequence because it was his actual statements that constituted the pledge from His Majesty&#x27;s Government. The Arab representatives also said McMahon had been acting as an intermediary for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Grey. Speaking in the House of Lords on 27 March 1923, Lord Grey said he had serious doubts about the validity of the Churchill White Paper&#x27;s interpretation of the pledges he, as Foreign Secretary, had caused to be given to the Sharif Hussein in 1915. The Arab representatives suggested a search for evidence in the files of the Foreign Office might clarify the Secretary of State&#x27;s intentions.

<doc id="266432" wikidata="Q6688762" url="?curid=266432" title="Louise Gold">
<text>Louise Gold (born 1956) is an English puppeteer, actress and singer. Her long career has included puppetry on television and roles in musical theatre in the West End, as well as other television, film and voice roles.

Gold was raised in London, beginning training in the arts. She began to appear in musical theatre in the mid-1970s. She was a puppeteer and voice actress for &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, for four seasons from 1977, and later for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and she has performed voice and puppet work on various other Muppet films, albums and television specials. She was a founder of, and lead puppeteer for, the satirical television show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; from 1984 to 1986 and occasionally thereafter.

Gold&#x27;s appearances in musical theatre shows in the West End include Joe Papp&#x27;s London production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; in 1982. She has played such roles as Mrs Johnstone in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, Reno Sweeney in &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, Kate in &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, Tanya in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, Phyllis in &quot;Follies&quot;, Baroness Bomburst in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, Miss Andrew in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, Mrs Sowerberry and Mrs Bedwin in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and Mazeppa in &quot;Gypsy&quot;. She was a regular performer in the Lost Musicals concert productions in London in the 1990s and performs in her own cabaret act.

==Early life==
Gold was born in London, to parents who were active with Unity Theatre in London. Her father was John Gold (1920–1998), a journalist, and her mother was an actress, Una Brandon-Jones (1916–2010). Her brother, Max (b. 1958), is also an actor. Gold trained at The Arts Educational Schools from age 11.

==Early career, television and puppeteering==
Gold made her professional debut in 1973, while still in her last year of school, in the Christmas pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington and his Cat&quot;, as Fairy Bowbells, at the Malvern Festival Theatre. She played in the musical &quot;Hair&quot; on tour in Britain in 1974. In 1975–76, she played Rachel in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; at the York Theatre Royal and then on tour (as Rachel and Potiphar&#x27;s Wife).

In 1977, Gold joined &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, during the show&#x27;s second season, where Jim Henson trained her as a puppeteer. She played several characters during her four seasons with the show, including Annie Sue Pig. She also sang on several of The Muppets&#x27; albums and was often paired vocally with Jerry Nelson. She was a puppeteer in the films &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982), and she appeared in various other Muppet series and specials. Muppet chronicler Christopher Finch wrote that Gold was &quot;the most versatile female puppeteer to work on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; [and] the only British member of the cast.&quot; During these years, she continued to appear in musicals and plays in between her commitments to The Muppets. Among her non-puppeteering television appearances, Gold was featured as Mrs Tyler, a Goodwife, in the first series episode &quot;Witchsmeller Pursuivant&quot; of &quot;Blackadder&quot; (1983). The same year, she appeared as Maureen Bedford in episode two of &quot;For 4 Tonight&quot;, a talk-show spoof. In 1991, she played the domineering Private Elsa Bigstern in two episodes of &quot;&#x27;Allo! &#x27;Allo!&quot;

From 1984 to 1986, and occasionally thereafter, Gold was a lead puppeteer and voice on the satirical television show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and was the lead singer (as Nancy Reagan) on their first single, &quot;Da Do Run Ron&quot;, a pastiche of The Crystals&#x27; &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;, released in 1984. Gold was the first puppeteer hired for the show and &quot;helped out with the &quot;Spitting Image&quot; pre-pilot, so she naturally became the &#x27;consultant&#x27; for the hiring [and training] of the rest&quot; of the puppeteers. Peter Fluck, a creator of the show, commented, &quot;Louise Gold always did the Queen and the mannerisms and facial expressions she put into it were wonderful. It was very exciting because this lump of clay we modelled with a fairly neutral expression came to life.&quot;

Gold&#x27;s later puppeteering work includes the title character, Fughetta Faffner, in &quot;The Ghost of Faffner Hall&quot; (1989), a Muppet music education TV Series. She played several of the characters on &quot;Roland Rat The Series&quot; broadcasts in 1986 and 1988, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the early 1990s, on &quot;Mopatop&#x27;s Shop&quot; in the early 2000s, and in &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; (1992) and &quot;Muppet Treasure Island&quot; (1996). In 1992, Gold played Sally Spook in &quot;The Spooks of Bottle Bay&quot;. In 1995 and 1997, she played characters on series 2 and series 3 of &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Animal Show with Stinky and Jake&quot;, including Tizzy Bee, an early example of a computer generated image puppet.

Gold lent her voice to an Australian puppet television programme in 2006, &quot;Five Minutes More&quot;. Gold was featured as a guest puppeteer, portraying the character of Babs (the female termite), on &quot;&quot; on BBC 2 television. She appeared in seven episodes broadcast from May to August 2009. In 2013–2014, Gold starred in &quot;That Puppet Game Show&quot;, a celebrity game show on BBC One, operating three of the puppet characters. She reprised her role as Annie Sue Pig in the 2014 film &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;, also operating a Muppet kangaroo. Also in 2014, she puppeteered on the CBeebies television series &quot;The Furchester Hotel&quot;, co-produced by &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. She plays Funella Furchester, the mother in a family of &quot;cheerfully incompetent monsters&quot; who own a hotel for monsters. In the Netflix series &quot;The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance&quot;, which premiered in 2019, she voices and is the puppeteer for Maudra Argot and is also the puppeteer for The All-Maudra, skekAyuk/The Gourmand and Onica.

==Stage roles to 1995==
From 1982, Gold began to appear in West End musicals. The first of these was as Isabel in the Joseph Papp production of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; (1982–83; playing the role of Edith in the 1983 film adaptation of the production). Her other stage roles in the 1980s included Divine Dixie Diva in &quot;Mrs Cole&#x27;s Music Hall&quot; at the Mill at Sonning (1984–85); Katisha, Countess of Grantham, in &quot;MetroPolitan Mikado&quot;, adapted from &quot;The Mikado&quot; by Ned Sherrin and Alistair Beaton at Queen Elizabeth Hall (1985); Bev in &quot;Angry Housewives&quot; at the Lyric Hammersmith Studio (1986); Mrs Johnstone in &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; at Watermill Theatre (1986); Maggot Scratcher in &quot;Sink the Belgrano!&quot; at Mermaid Theatre (1986); Sister Mary Amnesia in &quot;Nunsense&quot; at Fortune Theatre (1987; and singing on the original London cast album); Fanny Brice and other comedians in &quot;Ziegfeld&quot; (1988) at the London Palladium (which held the record, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, for &quot;Greatest Theatrical Losses&quot;); and Dick Whittington in &quot;Poppy&quot; at Half Moon Theatre (1988–89).

Gold next starred as Reno Sweeney in &quot;Anything Goes&quot; at Prince Edward Theatre (1990, replacing Elaine Paige; and on the 1995 studio cast album). In the summer of 1991 at Open Air Regents Park she played Titania in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and Adriana in &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (then toured as Adriana; &quot;[W]hen the gleefully statuesque, not-so-pure Gold ripped into the splendid trio of &quot;Sing for your Supper&quot;, we would have believed anything&quot;). Throughout the 1990s, Gold was a regular performer in the Lost Musicals concert productions, taking roles in fifteen of them and singing in associated BBC radio broadcasts. One of these was the British première of Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; at the Barbican Centre in 1992, in which Gold sang the title character, which she reprised in another Lost Musicals production at the Lindbury Studio Theatre, Royal Opera House, in 2000. These productions included four Cole Porter musicals in which Gold starred in roles that had been written for Ethel Merman.

Gold was Gussie in &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; at Haymarket Theatre, Leicester (1992; and on the 1993 cast album). She next played Sara Jane Moore in &quot;Assassins&quot; at Donmar Warehouse (1992–93) and toured in &quot;Noël/Cole: Let&#x27;s Do It&quot;, a Cole Porter and Noël Coward revue (1994 and 1995, beginning in Memphis, Tennessee; and on the cast album). She then played the title role in the stage musical adaptation of &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; at the Leicester Haymarket (1994–95). Gold appeared in &quot;Our Country&#x27;s Good&quot; in 1995 as Lieutenant Will Dawes and Liz Morden, together with her brother Max Gold as Captain Arthur Phillip and John Wisehammer, at Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Lyceum Theatre. Later that year, with the same cast, at the same theatre, the two performed in &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot;, with Louise as Tractor Driver and Grusche, and Max as Soldier, Executioner, Blockhead, Lavrenti, Trooper, Blackmailer and Groom.

==Stage roles since 1996==
In 1996, Gold toured as Mrs Silvia Tebrick, the title character (who transforms into a fox in full view of the audience) in the musical adaptation of &quot;Lady into Fox&quot;. After this, she starred as Dunyasha the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; at Albery Theatre in London and on tour (1996–97), followed by another summer in Regents Park as the title character in &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot; (1997). Paul Taylor, writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, declared, &quot;Louise Gold is a comically commanding figure – outdoing herself in campy gorge-rising revulsion and contentious, drop-dead postures on each successive verse of &#x27;I Hate Men&#x27;. This is... delivered here by performers who really know how to pace the song&quot;. She was back at the Fortune Theatre as Lizzie Curry in &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; (1999; one of the &quot;Lost Musicals&quot; series). &quot;The Stage&quot; commented, &quot;Louise Gold also shines in the role of Lizzie, revealing her emotional torment in &#x27;Old Maid&#x27;, and an overwhelming joy in &#x27;Is It Really Me?&#x27;&quot; The last of Gold&#x27;s Lost Musicals roles in the series for almost a decade was as May Daly/Mme Du Barry in &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot; at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in November 2001 (which she had also played as part of the series in 1993).

She played Tanya in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; for two years at the Prince Edward Theatre (2000–02) followed by Phyllis in &quot;Follies&quot; at the Royal Festival Hall (2002). &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote, &quot;Louise Gold&#x27;s Phyllis is versatile and formidable: injured queen one moment, vamp the next.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; found her &quot;wonderfully acerbic&quot;. During the summer of 2003, she performed at the Festival Theatre, Chichester, playing the Duchess of Plaza-Toro in &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; and starring as the fairy characters in &quot;The Water Babies&quot;. She then starred as Dotty Otley in &quot;Noises Off&quot; at the Piccadilly Theatre (2003). This was followed by Baroness Bomburst in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; at the London Palladium (2004–05). Critics noted, &quot;Gold always gives excellent value in musicals: she’s talented, funny and energetic&quot;; and &quot;The highlight of the show for me has to be Christopher Biggins and Louise Gold as Baron and Baroness Bomburst. If they are not the funniest and most outrageous double act in the West End, I would love to see who could outdo them.&quot;

Gold had another long run as the tyrannical Miss Andrew in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; at the Prince Edward Theatre (2006–08). In February 2008, she was the stoic widow O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Next Door&#x27;s Baby&quot;. From December 2008 to January 2011, Gold appeared in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, as Mrs Sowerberry and Mrs Bedwin, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. She sings these roles on the cast album. On Sundays in August and September 2010, while still performing in &quot;Oliver!&quot;, she returned to the Lost Musicals series, as Alice Challice in &quot;Darling of the Day&quot;, earning warm reviews. In 2011, she appeared as Montana in &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot;, another instalment of the Lost Musicals series. She played Berthe, the grandmother, in &quot;Pippin&quot;, in 2011–2012 at the Menier Chocolate Factory. In the autumn of 2014, she played Mazeppa in &quot;Gypsy&quot; at the Chichester Festival Theatre. That production transferred to the Savoy Theatre in the West End in March 2015, with Gold earning critical praise.

Gold portrayed Yente in the Menier Chocolate Factory revival of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; from November 2018 until March 2019, which then transferred to the Playhouse Theatre in the West End.

==Other performances==
Gold appeared in the 1985 film &quot;Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire&quot;, as the reporter, Miss Sullivan, and the 2000 film &quot;Topsy-Turvy&quot;, as Rosina Brandram, one of the original Gilbert and Sullivan performers, who plays Katisha in &quot;The Mikado&quot; during the course of the story.

Gold has also done a significant amount of radio and recording work and performs in her own cabaret show, which includes some puppeteering. She returned to television in 2011, guest-starring as a judge on a June 2011 episode of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and as aunt Annie in an episode of the children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Scoop&quot;, titled &quot;Come in Digby, Your Time&#x27;s Up&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gold lives with the actor James Vaughan. They have one son, Louis.

<text>Peter Hugh Dennis (born 13 February 1962) is an English comedian, presenter, actor, impressionist and writer. He was a panellist in every episode of the comedy show &quot;Mock the Week&quot; (2005–2022) and is one half of the double act Punt and Dennis alongside Steve Punt.

Dennis has also played Dr Piers Crispin in the sitcom &quot;My Hero&quot; (2000–2006), Pete Brockman in the sitcom &quot;Outnumbered&quot; (2007–2016, 2024), Toby in the sitcom &quot;Not Going Out&quot; (2014–present), and the Bank Manager in the first season of the comedy-drama series &quot;Fleabag&quot; (2016). He presents the community archaeology television show &quot;The Great British Dig&quot; (2020–present).

==Early life==
Peter Hugh Dennis was born in Kettering on 13 February 1962, the son of schoolteacher Dorothy Mary (née Hinnels) and Anglican priest John Dennis. His older brother, John Jr., is a diplomat who has served as the British Ambassador to Angola and the British Representative to Taiwan. He grew up in the Mill Hill suburb of London as his father was appointed vicar of the local John Keble Church soon after his birth. His father later became the Bishop of Knaresborough and then the Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich.

Dennis was educated at private University College School in London. During his time at UCS, he played rugby with Will Self and was head boy in his final year. He went on to read for the Geographical Tripos as an exhibitioner at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His thesis was titled &quot;The Spatial Distribution of Elementary Education in 19th-century Wakefield&quot;. He also joined the Footlights, where he first met Steve Punt and club president Nick Hancock, and the trio collaborated on a number of projects besides the annual revue. In 2016, Dennis said that he was approached by MI5 agents whilst at Cambridge University and attended a preliminary interview to join them; he decided that he did not want to take the option any further, particularly after being told during the interview that the job would require him to &quot;do people over&quot;.

After graduating with a first class honours degree, Dennis worked for Unilever for six years in the marketing department while performing comedy with Punt at venues including The Comedy Store in London at weekends. Whilst at Unilever, Dennis became a brand manager of Lynx deodorant. His time at Unilever came to an end when he and Punt had their BBC Radio 1 show &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, which they had created alongside David Baddiel and Rob Newman, commissioned for BBC Two. Dennis was put on sabbatical by Unilever, as rehearsals for the show were to take place on a weekday, but he never returned to the company and instead chose to pursue comedy full-time as a result of the show&#x27;s success.

Dennis uses his middle name Hugh as his stage name because the actor Peter Dennis was already a member of the performing arts union Equity.

==Career==

As an impressionist, Dennis did voices for &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and appeared with Punt as resident support comics on two TV series hosted on the BBC by Jasper Carrott. Dennis also appeared twice as a contestant on the topical panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, including one opposite former schoolmate Self.

Punt and Dennis&#x27;s radio career includes over a decade of performing &quot;Punt and Dennis&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Been a Bad Week&quot;, &quot;The Party Line&quot; and the satirical radio comedy show, &quot;The Now Show&quot;. On &quot;The Now Show&quot;, Dennis was originally in a line-up including Punt, Mitch Benn, Laura Shavin, Jon Holmes and Marcus Brigstocke. He is friends with Chris Morris and has had cameos on &quot;Brass Eye&quot; as well as doing the narration for the CBBC show &quot;Sam and Mark&#x27;s Guide to Dodging Disaster&quot;.

In December 2009, Dennis joined Oz Clarke in presenting the 60-minute Christmas special &quot;Oz and Hugh Drink to Christmas&quot; broadcast on BBC Two. In December 2010 the pair returned for a four-part series called &quot;Oz and Hugh Raise the Bar&quot;, which puts them in a competition to create a bar featuring only local British food and drinks.

Dennis has starred in a number of sitcoms, including &quot;My Hero&quot;, in which he played obnoxious GP Piers Crispin. From 2007 to 2014, he starred in &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, a semi-improvised sitcom based around family life and won a BAFTA nomination in the comedy category for the 2009 Christmas special. On Radio 4 he also featured in the sitcom &quot;Revolting People&quot; which, like &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, was co-written by Andy Hamilton.

Besides his regular television work, Dennis was a panellist on &quot;Mock the Week&quot; and appeared in every episode since its premiere in 2005, with the exception of a special episode of the programme that was broadcast as part of David Walliams&#x27; &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;. He is a regular guest on various BBC-broadcast comedy panel game shows such as &quot;They Think It&#x27;s All Over&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot;, &quot;QI&quot; and has guest hosted &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. In 2011, Dennis hosted the short-lived improvisational comedy series &quot;Fast and Loose&quot;.

Beginning on 16 February 2012, Dennis and Julia Bradbury hosted a four-part BBC One documentary series &quot;The Great British Countryside&quot;. Since October 2014, Dennis plays Toby in the long-running sitcom &quot;Not Going Out&quot;.

In 2016, Dennis appeared as the Bank Manager in the BBC Three series &quot;Fleabag&quot;, acting alongside Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the first, fourth, and final episodes of series 1.

In February 2021, Dennis started presenting &quot;The Great British Dig&quot; on More 4.

In the September 2021, Bond film &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, Dennis cameoed as a scientist in an MI6 laboratory.

==Personal life==
Dennis lives in London, having previously lived near Chichester. He married Miranda Carroll in 1987 and they divorced in 1993. He married Catherine Abbot-Anderson in 1996, and they had a son and a daughter before divorcing in 2015. In June 2018, it was confirmed that he was in a relationship with his &quot;Outnumbered&quot; co-star Claire Skinner.

Dennis is a supporter of Arsenal FC, and a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society. He took part in the 2007 L&#x27;Étape du Tour, cycling an open stage of the Tour de France for amateurs which was held in the mountains two weeks before the main event, and completed it in 11 hours and 7 minutes.

In 2008, Dennis received an Honorary fellowship from the University of Northampton.

In 2011, Dennis completed the Great South Run in Portsmouth for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society.

In 2024 he became the Chancellor of the University of Winchester.

<text>Gaston Frommel (November 25, 1862, in Altkirch, France – May 18, 1906, in Geneva, Switzerland) was a French-Swiss protestant pastor and professor of theology at the University of Geneva from 1894 until his death.

== Life ==
A Frenchman by birth, his family fled Alsace under German occupation in 1870 and he spent the rest of his life in Switzerland. He may best be described as continuing the spirit of Alexandre Rodolphe Vinet amid the mental conditions marking the end of the 19th century.

Like Vinet, he derived his philosophy of religion from a peculiarly deep experience of the Gospel of Christ as meeting the demands of the moral consciousness; but he developed even further than Vinet the psychological analysis of conscience and the method of verifying every doctrine by direct reference to spiritual experience. Both made much of moral individuality or personality as the crown and criterion of reality, believing that its correlation with Christianity, both historically and philosophically, was most intimate.

But while Vinet laid most stress on the liberty from human authority essential to the moral consciousness, the changed needs of the age caused Frommel to develop rather the aspect of man&#x27;s dependence as a moral being upon God&#x27;s spiritual initiative, &quot;the conditional nature of his liberty.&quot; &quot;Liberty is not the primary, but the secondary characteristic&quot; of conscience; &quot;before being free, it is the subject of obligation.&quot; On this depends its objectivity as a real revelation of the Divine Will.

Thus he claimed that a deeper analysis carried one beyond the human subjectivity of even Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative, since consciousness of obligation was &quot;une experience imposée sous le mode de l&#x27;absolu.&quot; By his use of &quot;imposée&quot; Frommel emphasized the priority of man&#x27;s sense of obligation to his consciousness either of self or of God. Here he appealed to the current psychology of the subconscious for confirmation of his analysis, by which he claimed to transcend mere intellectualism. In his language on this fundamental point he was perhaps too jealous of admitting an ideal element as implicit in the feeling of obligation. Still he did well in insisting on priority to self-conscious thought as a mark of metaphysical objectivity in the case of moral, no less than of physical experience.

Further, he found in the Christian revelation the same characteristics as belonged to the universal revelation involved in conscience, viz., God&#x27;s sovereign initiative and his living action in history. From this standpoint he argued against a purely psychological type of religion (&quot;agnosticisme religieux&quot;; as he termed it)--a tendency to which he saw even in A Sabatier and the &quot;symbolofidéisme&quot; of the Paris School—as giving up a real and unifying faith. His influence on men, especially the student class, was greatly enhanced by the religious force and charm of his personality. Finally, like Vinet, he was a man of letters and a penetrating critic of men and systems.

<text>A constituent assembly (also known as a constitutional convention, constitutional congress, or constitutional assembly) is a body assembled for the purpose of drafting or revising a constitution. Members of a constituent assembly may be elected by popular vote, drawn by sortition, appointed, or some combination of these methods. Assemblies are typically considered distinct from a regular legislature, although members of the legislature may compose a significant number or all of its members. As the fundamental document constituting a state, a constitution cannot normally be modified or amended by the state&#x27;s normal legislative procedures in some jurisdictions; instead a constitutional convention or a constituent assembly, the rules for which are normally laid down in the constitution, must be set up. A constituent assembly is usually set up for its specific purpose, which it carries out in a relatively short time, after which the assembly is dissolved. A constituent assembly is a form of representative democracy.

Unlike forms of constitution-making in which a constitution is unilaterally imposed by a sovereign lawmaker, the constituent assembly creates a constitution through &quot;internally imposed&quot; actions, in that members of the constituent assembly are themselves citizens, but not necessarily the political leaders, of the country for which they are creating a constitution. As described by Columbia University Social Sciences Professor Jon Elster:

&quot;Constitutions arise in a number of different ways. At the non-democratic extreme of the spectrum, we may imagine a sovereign lawgiver laying down the constitution for all later generations. At the democratic extreme, we may imagine a constituent assembly elected by universal suffrage for the sole task of writing a new constitution. And there are all sorts of intermediate arrangements.&quot;
== By country ==
=== Australia ===
Australia held four constitutional conventions, one each in 1891, 1897, 1973, and 1998.

=== Bangladesh ===
The Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh was the first and, to date, the only constitution-making body of Bangladesh, convened in 1972 by the government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman following the country&#x27;s independence. It comprised representatives elected in the national and provincial council elections of Pakistan held in 1970. As the assembly was formed with representatives elected under the Legal Framework Order, 1970, issued by Pakistan&#x27;s then-military ruler and President Yahya Khan, several political parties and political leaders, including Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, Badruddin Umar, A.S.M. Abdur Rab, Farhad Mazhar, and others, have labeled this assembly as illegitimate. However, despite the controversies and opposition, Sheikh Mujib&#x27;s uncompromising leadership enabled the Constituent Assembly to draft and enact the Constitution in less than a year. However, from the time of its drafting until today, the constitution has been often labelled as &quot;fascist&quot; and criticized for fostering autocracy and failing to adequately safeguard human rights.

In the aftermath of 2024 mass uprising, the interim government of Bangladesh is mulling over convening a new constituent assembly to draft a new inclusive democratic constitution, ensuring the inviolability of human dignity. 

See also 2024 Bangladesh constitutional crisis.

=== Chile ===

As of May 2021 Chile is the most recently elected constitutional assembly. The 155 members of this assembly were elected between 15 and 16 May 2021. The assembly has gender parity (50% females and 50% males) and has 17 seats reserved for people belonging to indigenous peoples. The assembly is granted 12 months to draft a new constitution, which has to be ratified by referendum once written, with compulsory voting.

=== Costa Rica ===

Immediately after the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War that overthrew the Rafael Angel Calderón Government, the leaders of the victorious side called for the election of a Constituent Assembly in the same year. The Assembly successfully drafted and approved the current Costa Rican Constitution.

===Denmark===

The Danish Constituent Assembly (; lit. &quot;The Constitution giving Assembly of the Realm&quot;) of 1848 established the Constitution of Denmark in 1849 (; lit. &quot;The Constitutional Act of the Realm of Denmark&quot;) and formalized the transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy. The assembly consisted of members of which 114 were directly elected in October 1848, 38 were appointed by the king and the rest were government ministers. The constituent assembly met at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen and first met on 23 October 1848. The assembly was overall split in three different groupings: the National liberals, the Friends of Peasants, and the Conservatives. A key topic for discussion was the political system, and the rules governing elections. On 25 May 1849, the constituent assembly approved the new constitution, and on 5 June 1849 it was signed by King Frederick VII. For this reason, it is also known as the &quot;June constitution&quot;. Today, 5 June is known as Constitution Day in Denmark.

=== European Union ===
The European Convention (2001) drafted the Constitution for Europe for approval by the European Council and ratification by the member states. This constitution was abandoned after being rejected in French and Dutch referendums, and was replaced by the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007.

=== France ===

During the French Revolution (from July 1789 to September 1791) a National Constituent Assembly () was formed when representatives assembled at the only location available – a tennis court – and swore the Tennis Court Oath on June 20, 1789, promising that they would not adjourn until they had drafted a new constitution for France. Louis XVI recognized the validity of the National Constituent Assembly on June 27, 1789.

See also 1848 French Constituent Assembly election.

=== Germany ===
Parlamentarischer Rat (Parliamentary Council) (1948) – Drafted the Basic Law of the Federal Republic for ratification by the &quot;Länder&quot;. This council was not recognized as legitimate by Soviet-occupied East Germany, which drafted its own constitution in 1949 and would not accept the Basic Law until German reunification in 1990.

=== Iceland ===
On 27 November 2010, Iceland held an election for a constitutional assembly, with 522 people competing for 25 delegate seats. The assembly, in session for four months from early April until late July 2011, drafted a new constitution and passed it unanimously with 25 votes and no abstentions. On 20 October 2012 the parliament put the bill to a national referendum, in which 67% of the voters supported the bill. Further, 67% of the voters supported equal voting rights (one person, one vote) and 83% supported national ownership of natural resources, two key provisions of the bill. Parliament has failed to ratify the bill, however, inviting accusations that the political class is trying to thwart the will of the people by disrespecting the result of the 2012 constitutional referendum.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, the government elected in March 2011 has committed to establishing constitutional amendments on six specified issues and others it may consider; the government has separately promised amendments on five other issues.

=== India ===

The Constituent Assembly of India was elected to write the Constitution of India, and served as its first Parliament as an independent nation. It was set up as a result of negotiations between the leaders of the Indian independence movement and members of the British Cabinet Mission. The constituent assembly was elected indirectly by the members of the Provincial legislative assembly, which existed under the British Raj. It first met on December 9, 1946, in Delhi. On August 15, 1947, India became an independent nation, and the Constituent Assembly started functioning as India&#x27;s Parliament. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar drafted the Constitution of India in conjunction with the requisite deliberations and debates in the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly approved the Constitution on November 26, 1949 (celebrated as Constitution Day), and it took effect on January 26, 1950 — a day now commemorated as Republic Day in India. Once the Constitution took effect, the Constituent Assembly became the Provisional Parliament of India.

=== Indonesia ===

The Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia was established to draw up a permanent constitution. Its membership was elected in November 1955, and it met for the first time in November 1956. After four sessions, it failed to agree on the fundamental basis for the state. It was dissolved in 1959, and the original constitution imposed by presidential decree.(OTP)

===Italy===

The Constituent Assembly of Italy was established in 1946 in the wake of Fascist Italy&#x27;s defeat during World War II. It was elected with universal suffrage, simultaneously with a referendum about the adoption of Republic or the continuation of monarchy. Voters chose Republic, and the new assembly had the task to approve the new republic governments, as well as to write a new constitution. This was approved on 22 December 1947.

It was dissolved on 31 January 1948, to be replaced by the new Parliament of Italy.

=== Mexico ===
The Viceroyalty of New Spain sent deputies to the Cortes of Cadiz, which enacted the 1812 Constitution. By the time this Constitution was enacted, an insurgency fighting for independence from Spain was already established.

The first Constituent Congress of independent Mexico, known as the Congress of Anahuac, was first gathered in Chilpancingo whilst the war of independence was still ongoing. During the opening of Congress, José María Morelos outlined its program in a document called &quot;Sentimientos de la Nación&quot; (Feelings of the Nation), which was the first antecedent of the various Constitutions of Mexico. Being persecuted by royalist troops, the Congress fled Chilpancingo and gathered in Apatzingán.

On October 22, 1814, the Congress enacted the Constitutional Decree for the Liberty of Mexican America (&quot;Decreto Constitucional para la Libertad de la América Mexicana&quot;), known as the Constitution of Apatzingán. The 1814 Constitution entered into force in the territories dominated by the insurgents, but as the war continued and the first insurgent leaders (like Morelos) were defeated, it was largely forgotten.

After independence was consummated on September 27, 1821, and based on the &quot;Plan de Iguala&quot; and the Treaty of Córdoba, the Provisional Governing Junta was stablished. The Junta proclaimed the Act of Independence of the Mexican Empire and acted as a &quot;de facto&quot; legislative assembly until February 24, 1822, when the Constituent Congress was gathered. On May 19, 1822, the Constituent Congress proclaimed Agustín de Iturbide as Emperor. The relations between Emperor and Congress were always problematic, a situation that led to the dissolution of Congress by Iturbide on October 31, 1822, without a formal Constitution being enacted.

After the dissolution of Congress, Iturbide created the National Instituent Junta, which enacted the Provisional Political Bylaws of the Mexican Empire on December 18, 1822. The dissolution of Congress had resulted in an armed revolution under the &quot;Plan de Casa Mata&quot;, which called for the establishment of a Federal Republic and for the restoration of the Constituent Congress. Iturbide was forced to abdicate and he reinstalled the Constituent Congress.

The Congress then created a provisional government, called the Triumvirate, and enacted the Constituent Act of the Mexican Federation, by which the former Provinces of Mexico were transformed into free and sovereign States. After this, a Constituent Congress was formed with the participation of the States and it enacted the 1824 Constitution.

Many disputes aroused between federalists and centralists, which resulted in political instability and in 1836 the &quot;Siete Leyes&quot; (Seven Laws) were enacted. The &quot;Siete Leyes&quot; dissolved the federation and created a unitary republic, but that ended in 1846 when the Constitutive and Reforms Act was enacted and the 1824 Constitution, and thus the federation, was restored.

On October 16, 1854, President Juan Álvarez, under the &quot;Plan de Ayutla&quot;, decreed the formation of another Constituent Congress, which met in 1856. During the presidency of Ignacio Comonfort, the Constituent Congress enacted the 1857 Constitution, which was liberal in character. The Constitution was not well received by the church and Mexican conservatives, and the &quot;Plan de Tacubaya&quot; called for its derogation. This events led to the Reform War, which the liberals won, then restoring the 1857 Constitution and adding to it the Reform Laws.

After the Porfiriato, and whilst the Mexican Revolution was still being fought, President Venustiano Carranza formed a Constituent Congress, which met in Querétaro and enacted the still-current Political Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1917.

=== Nepal ===

Nepal had two Constituent assemblies, the last one being elected after its predecessor failed to deliver a constitution, despite multiple extensions. It also served as the country&#x27;s parliament.
Finally Nepal had made constitution with 89% majority. Nepal has adopted Federalism since.

=== Poland ===
The Great Sejm (also known as &quot;Four-Year Sejm&quot;) was held between 1788 and 1792. Its principal aim became to restore sovereignty to, and reform, the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth politically and economically. These attempts were made by writing Constitution of 3 May 1791 that was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The constitution lasted for merely a year because of the Polish-Russian War of 1792 and the Third Partition of Poland.

=== Philippines ===
The Philippines has had several conventions:

* 1898 – drafted the 1898 Malolos Constitution, the basic law of the First Philippine Republic, the first constitutional republic in Asia. The drafted constitution was written by Felipe Calderón y Roca and Felipe Buencamino as an alternative to a pair of proposals to the Malolos Congress by Apolinario Mabini and Pedro Paterno. After a lengthy debate in the latter part of 1898, it was enacted on 21 January 1899.
* 1935 – to draft a constitution to create the autonomous Commonwealth of the Philippines under the U.S. Tydings–McDuffie Act. The constitution was also used in the 3rd Republic (1946) until the passage of the 1973 constitution. Members were elected through the 1934 Philippine Constitutional Convention election
* 1971 – to draft a revised constitution to replace the old U.S. 1935 Philippine constitution. Members were elected through the 1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election. The system of government changed from presidential to parliamentary to presidential-parliamentary (in 1984 amendment). 
* 1986 – The ex-constitution lasted until the downfall of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and Corazon Aquino appointed members to draft the 1987 Constitution through the 1986 Commission.

=== Russia ===

The Russian Constituent Assembly was established in Russia in the wake of the October Revolution of 1917 to form a new constitution after the overthrow of the Russian Provisional Government.

===Sri Lanka===
The Sri Lankan Parliament approved the creation of a Sri Lanka Constitutional Assembly on March 9, 2016, proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe. The assembly will draft a new constitution for Sri Lanka.

===Turkey===
Constituent Assembly of Turkey was established in 1961 after the 1960 Turkish coup d&#x27;état to prepare a democratic constitution. The constitution was prepared and approved by the voters in a referendum of 1961.

=== United States ===

====Federal====
The U.S. Constitutional Convention drafted the still-current United States Constitution in 1787. Its delegates were appointed by the states, not directly elected, and not all states sent delegates; moreover, the convention was originally charged with drafting amendments to the Articles of Confederation rather than a new constitution.

The US Constitution contains no provision for its own replacement (and because of the presence of entrenched clauses it cannot be revoked through an amendment). Article V of the Constitution does permit Congress to appoint a national constitutional convention to propose amendments but it has never done so. While Congress has the option to submit both its own proposals for amendments and those of a national convention to state conventions rather than the state legislatures for ratification; this process has been used only once (for the Twenty-first Amendment).

====States====
A long tradition in the use of constituent assemblies exists at the state level of Constitutionalism. In fact, constituent assemblies met in the states before the formation of the Federal Constitution in 1787 as well as after its ratification. Since 1776 nearly 150 state constitutional conventions have met to draft or revise state constitutions.

These early state constitutional conventions frequently did not use procedural steps like popular ratification that became commonplace in the mid-19th century. Yet they were considered to be constituent assemblies that exercised their authority as that of the people. As &quot;American Sovereigns: The People and America&#x27;s Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War&quot; by Christian G. Fritz notes:.
&quot;A legitimate constitution depended on whether the sovereign people authorized it, not whether a particular procedure was used or whether revolutionary conventions were free of other responsibilities, such as passing ordinary legislation. It was the people as the sovereign who authorized drafting those first [state] constitutions that gave them their legitimacy, not whether they used procedures that matched what was later understood to be necessary to create fundamental law.&quot; 

American state constituent assemblies in the 19th and 20th centuries reflected many qualities of a citizen&#x27;s movement. From the start of state American constitution-making, delegates to constitutional conventions studied earlier state models of constitutions. They often self-consciously &quot;borrow[ed]&quot; constitutional text and provisions from other states. They often used in their drafting and debates compact and pocket-sized compilations of all the existing American constitutions, so that the constituent&#x27;s assembly could draw upon the latest in constitutional design. The powers of these state constituent assemblies were also highly contested, with some claiming that they had unlimited legal power and others claiming that they must operate within the pre-existing legal landscape. In the end, a common law of constituent power emerged which held that elected constituent assemblies had limited powers.

Several U.S. states have held multiple conventions over the years to change their particular state&#x27;s constitutions.

* Missouri has held six, in 1820, 1845, 1865, 1875, 1922, and 1945.
* Michigan has held four, in 1835, 1850, 1908 and 1963.
* Massachusetts has held six, in 1778, 1779–80, 1820–21, 1853, 1917–18, and most recently 2016.
* The Constitution of New York has been amended, or re-established de novo, through nine Constitutional Conventions: in 1776–1777, 1801, 1821, 1846, 1867–1868, 1894, 1915, 1938, and 1967; a Constitutional Commission in 1872–1873; and a Judicial Convention in 1921.
* Vermont&#x27;s first constitution was drafted by a convention that met in July 1777 and revised by a convention that met in 1786, both of these conventions occurring when Vermont was still independent of the United States. Vermont was admitted into the United States in 1791 and its government continued to function under the 1786 constitution. Two years later in 1793 held another convention to bring some provisions of its constitution into line with the Constitution of the United States.
* Virginia Conventions have included six unlimited meetings. Constitutions were promulgated by fiat in 1776, 1864 and 1901–02, and ratified by referendum in 1829–30, 1850, and 1868. Limited Conventions and Constitutional Commissions resulting in revisions were held in 1927, 1945, 1956 and 1968. Subsequently, the state legislature proposes amendments that are ratified in popular referendum.

==== State constitutional conventions ====
All 50 states have had at least one Constitutional Convention, numbering over 233. 11 were illegal and defeated by arms (Confederacy and Dorr&#x27;s Rebellion). 12 were illegal and won through arms (Revolutionary War, Republic of Texas, and Vermont Republic). 37 were made in accordance with a Federal enabling law.
==== Legislative restrictions surpassed ====
State legislatures put restrictions on conventions that were not followed in these cases.

* Georgia 1789 proposed alternatives instead of accepting or rejecting a constitution.
* Illinois 1862 and 1869 disregarded a requirement for an oath.
* New York 1867 worked past its deadline and submitted its work later.
* Pennsylvania 1872 against restriction altered the Bill of Rights.
* Alabama 1901 increase delegate pay above limit.
* Michigan 1908 submitted its work in November not April.

== Countries without an entrenched constitution ==
A few countries do not have an entrenched constitution, which can thus be amended by normal legislative procedures; the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Israel are examples. In these countries there is no need to call constituent assemblies, and no provision to do so, as the legislature can effectively modify the constitution.

Although it lacks a written constitution, the United Kingdom has had several conventions at the subnational level including:

* Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention (1975–1976) – a failed attempt to find a solution to the status of Northern Ireland.
* Scottish Constitutional Convention (1989) – produced a plan for Scottish devolution.

The constitution of New Zealand consists of a collection of statutes (Acts of Parliament), Treaties, Orders-in-Council, Letters Patent, decisions of the Courts and unwritten constitutional conventions. Because it is not supreme law, the constitution is comparatively easy to reform, requiring only a majority of Members of Parliament to amend it.

The constitutional law of Israel is determined by the Knesset which, since 1949, serves as the country&#x27;s ongoing constituent assembly. The Knesset has the power to create Basic Laws of Israel, laws which are entrenched legislation and will become part of a &quot;future&quot; constitution of Israel, as well as &quot;regular&quot; statutory legislation.

<doc id="266438" wikidata="Q1719229" url="?curid=266438" title="KYTV (TV series)">
<text>KYTV is a British television comedy series about a fictional television station. It ran on BBC2 from 1989 to 1993, and satirised satellite television in the UK at the time.

==History==
The show was in effect the television version of &quot;Radio Active&quot;, which spoofed local radio stations, and was developed by the same team.

It was written by Angus Deayton and Geoffrey Perkins, produced by Jamie Rix, directed by John Kilby and John Stroud, with music by Philip Pope. The majority of the programme&#x27;s scripts had already aired on &quot;Radio Active&quot;.

The five key actors all performed various roles, some multiple, others on a single occasion. Their main characters as presenters were:

* Angus Deayton as Mike Channel
* Helen Atkinson-Wood as Anna Daptor
* Michael Fenton Stevens as Martin Brown
* Geoffrey Perkins as Mike Flex
* Philip Pope simply as The Continuity Announcer (not named)

The pilot episode was broadcast on 12 May 1989, and a series of six programmes began on 3 May 1990. A second series of six began on 17 March 1992, and a final six episodes were broadcast between 17 September and 22 October 1993, plus an additional Children in Need special, making a total of 19 episodes.

In 1992, the series won the Silver Rose and the Special Prize of the City of Montreux at the Festival Rose d&#x27;Or for the episode &quot;Good Morning Calais&quot;. In the DVD commentary for &quot;The Micallef Programme&quot;, lead writer and performer Shaun Micallef cites the series as an inspiration for his series&#x27; format.

==Format==
&quot;KYTV&quot; combined irreverent sketches and variety elements (such as song-and-dance routines) with a broad-based satire of the public perception of UK satellite television – that of opportunistic entrepreneurs producing cheap, low-quality television in order to exploit viewers.

KYTV was a fictional low-budget satellite television station named after its owner Sir Kenneth Yellowhammer, and bore a suspicious similarity to Sky Television.
In the second series, &quot;KYTV&quot; merged with the fictional &#x27;BSE Television&#x27;, just as Sky merged with BSB. The channel&#x27;s new name was also KYTV, composed from the first two letters of KYTV and the last two from BSETV. This is similar to BSkyB, composed from the three letters of BSB and the remainder from Sky. The third series featured parodies of the early idents and logo used by Carlton Television.

Each episode featured a central theme (for example, a terrorist siege, the Channel Tunnel, or a costume drama) around which sketches could revolve.

Comedic elements included:

* malfunctioning equipment;
* rolling news channels with little content or analysis;
* sensationalist and dumbed down shows (&quot;Murder. Gruesome, bloody murder. Coming right up, after the break. Tell your neighbours&quot;);
* underpaid, incompetent and amateurish staff;
* lavish &#x27;showcase sequences&#x27; compared to shoddy, makeshift visuals or unfinished sets;
* endless repeats of imported or old (and therefore cheap) programmes as an attempt to fill yawning gulfs of airtime;
* relentless commercial intrusions, including plugs for shopping channels (&#x27;By the way, Mike, that&#x27;s a very smart tie you have on!&#x27; &#x27;Yes, and it&#x27;s only £18.99 at Sofa Shop!&#x27;)

A regular feature was &quot;Mike Flex&#x27;s Master Quiz&quot;, in which contestants typically had to answer one question correctly to win &#x27;a château in the Loire&#x27;. Flex always managed to arrange the questions in such a way that nobody&#x27;s answer was ever quite right. (&quot;Name That Tune&quot;: &#x27;Beatles, Yellow Submarine!&#x27; &#x27;Sorry, it was &quot;The&quot; Beatles, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Bad luck.&#x27;)

<text>Louis Auguste Sabatier (; 22 October 1839 – 12 April 1901) was a French Protestant theologian.

==Biography==
He was born at Vallon-Pont-d&#x27;Arc, Ardèche and died in Strasbourg. 

He was educated at the Protestant theological faculty of Montauban as well as at the universities of Tübingen and Heidelberg.

After holding the pastorate at Aubenas in Ardèche from 1864 to 1868, he was appointed professor of reformed dogmatics at the Protestant theological faculty of Strasbourg. His markedly French sympathies during the War of 1870 led to his expulsion from Strassburg in 1872. After five years&#x27; effort he succeeded in establishing a Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris (today: Faculté de théologie protestante de Paris) along with Eugène Ménégoz, and became professor and then dean. In 1886, he became a teacher in the newly founded religious science department of the École des Hautes Etudes at the Sorbonne.

His brother, Paul, was a noted theological historian. He is the father of two daughters, Marguerite Chevalley, translator, and Lucie Chevalley. Claude Chevalley, mathematician, is his grandson.

== Recognition == 
In 1901, Sabatier was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by French historian Gabriel Monod for his &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;une philosophie de la religion d&#x27;après la psychologie et l&#x27;histoire&quot; (&quot;Outlines of a Philosophy of Religion based on Psychology and History&quot;, 1897). He died before his only chance to be awarded.

== Published works ==
Among Louis Auguste Sabatier&#x27;s chief works were:
* &quot;Essai sur les sources de la vie de Jésus, Les Trois premiers Évangiles et le quatrième&quot; (&quot;Essay on the Sources of the Life of Jesus, The First Three Gospels and the Fourth&quot;, 1866)
* &quot;L&#x27;Apôtre Paul&quot; (&quot;The Apostle Paul&quot;, 1870)
* &quot;Mémoire sur la notion hébraïque de l&#x27;Esprit&quot; (&quot;Memory on the Hebrew Notion of the Spirit&quot;, 1879)
* &quot;Études sur la révocation de l&#x27;édit de Nantes&quot;: with Frank Puaux (&quot;Studies on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes&quot;, 1886)
* &quot;Les origines littéraires et la composition de l&#x27;apocalypse de Saint Jean&quot; (&quot;The Literary Origins and Composition of the Apocalypse of Saint John&quot;, 1888)
* &quot;De la vie intime des dogmes et de leur puissance d&#x27;évolution&quot; (&quot;The Vitality of Christian Dogmas and their Power of Evolution&quot;, 1890)
* &quot;L&#x27;Évangile de Pierre et les évangile canoniques&quot; (&quot;The Gospel of Peter and the Canonical Gospels&quot;, 1893)
* &quot;Religion et culture moderne&quot; (&quot;Religion and Modern Culture&quot;, 1897)
* &quot;Évolution historique de la doctrine du salut&quot; (&quot;The Doctrine of the Atonement and its Historical Evolution&quot;, 1903)
* &quot;Esquisse d&#x27;une philosophie de la religion d&#x27;après la psychologie et l&#x27;histoire&quot; (&quot;Outlines of a Philosophy of Religion based on Psychology and History&quot;, 1897)
* &quot;Les Religions d&#x27;autorité et religion de l&#x27;esprit&quot; (&quot;Religions of Authority and the Religion of the Spirit&quot;, 1904; posthumous), to which his colleague Jean Réville prefixed a short memoir.

These works show Sabatier as &quot;at once an accomplished dialectician and a mystic in the best sense of the word&quot;.

<text>Alistair Charles McGowan (born 24 November 1964) is an English impressionist, comic, actor, pianist, poet, and writer best known to British audiences for &quot;The Big Impression&quot; (formerly &quot;Alistair McGowan&#x27;s Big Impression&quot;), which was, for four years, one of BBC1&#x27;s top-rating comedy programmes – winning numerous awards, including a BAFTA in 2003. He has also worked extensively in theatre and appeared in the West End in &quot;Art&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;The Mikado&quot;, &quot;Pymalion&quot;, and &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; (for which he received a &quot;Laurence Olivier Award&quot; nomination). As a television actor, he played the lead role in BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Mayo&quot;. He wrote the play &quot;Timing&quot; (nominated as Best New Comedy at the whatsonstage.com awards) and the book &quot;A Matter of Life and Death: Or How to Wean A Man off Football&quot; with former comedy partner Ronni Ancona. He released an album of classical piano music called The Piano Album in 2017, and his poetry collection Not What We Were Expecting was published in 2024.

==Music==
In 2013 McGowan explained in a piece for &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he had &quot;... hero-worshipped the French composer Erik Satie for many years. Not only was he a hugely innovative and visionary composer – but he was also a man with a passion for all forms of art.&quot; In 2014 McGowan narrated, in the guise of Satie, a concert of surrealist ballet music from Paris in the 1920s, given by the BBC Concert Orchestra at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London and broadcast live by BBC Radio 3. In 2017 he released a debut album on Sony Classical featuring piano performances of classical music. Having previously had a very limited repertoire, McGowan practised intensively for nine months to complete the recording.

In January 2009 it was announced that McGowan in partnership with three other Greenpeace activists, including actress Emma Thompson, had bought land near Sipson, Middlesex, a village under threat from the proposed third runway for Heathrow Airport. It is hoped that the area of ground, half the size of a football pitch, will prevent the government from carrying through its plan to expand Heathrow. The field, bought for an undisclosed sum from a local land owner, will be split into small squares and sold across the globe. When interviewed Mr McGowan said: &quot;BAA were so confident of getting the Government&#x27;s go ahead, but we have cunningly bought the land they need to build their runway.&quot;

In 2009 he attended the Bromley Environmental Awards and was the celebrity guest at Bromley Civic Centre where the awards were presented to various schools in the borough.

<text>Kate Elizabeth Robbins (born 21 August 1958) is an English actress, singer, and songwriter. She came to prominence in the early 1980s when she scored a top ten single on the UK Official Charts with &quot;More Than in Love&quot;, while she was appearing in the television soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;. She went on to become a prolific voice actress, most notably for nine years with the satirical show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;.

==Early life==
Robbins is the older sister of fellow actress Amy Robbins, sculptor Jane Robbins, and &quot;The Sheilas&quot; singer Emma Robbins. Her older brother is radio broadcaster and actor Ted Robbins. Through her sister Emma she was the sister-in-law of Simon Shelton and through her sister Amy she is the sister-in-law of actor Robert Daws.

Her father was Mike Robbins, who grew up in Hightown, Wrexham, the son of Ted, who served as the secretary of the Football Association of Wales for more than 35 years.

She attended Wirral Grammar School for Girls in Bebington, Cheshire.

Robbins is a first cousin once removed of Paul McCartney as her mother Elizabeth &quot;Bett&quot; Robbins (née Danher) was McCartney&#x27;s cousin. In 1960, McCartney and John Lennon performed as &quot;The Nerk Twins&quot; at the Fox and Hounds pub in Caversham, Reading, which was run by Bett and her husband Mike.

==Career==
Robbins&#x27; first released recording, in 1978, was the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, from the musical &quot;Annie&quot;. Robbins&#x27; first chart appearance was as a backing singer, along with her sister Jane, on the minor Top 40 hit &quot;Lines&quot; by Liverpool group Planets, a spin-off from Deaf School.

Her profile was raised soon afterwards when both she and Jane represented the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 as part of the group Prima Donna. They finished third.

The following year, Robbins joined the cast of the ITV soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;, playing the part of a pop singer who was recording a single in the fictional motel&#x27;s basement recording studio. The song, &quot;More Than in Love&quot;, was released commercially in the UK, credited as Kate Robbins and Beyond and gave Robbins a major hit single, reaching number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. It was her only lead-vocal hit.

In late 1982, Robbins provided backing vocals on the Top 3 single &quot;Story of the Blues&quot; by Wah!.

Robbins wrote the first theme tune to &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot; performed by Cilla Black.

She provided almost all the female voices on the television show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She sang the lead vocals on &quot;The Chicken Song&quot; with Michael Fenton Stevens which reached number 1 in 1986.

The 1986 Granada Television sketch show &quot;Robbins&quot; featured Kate, her brother Ted Robbins, and her sisters Amy Robbins, Jane Robbins and Emma Robbins. 

She participated in the 1989 &quot;Children&#x27;s Royal Variety Performance&quot; BBC, singing her own comic songs at the piano, and featured in the original series of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in 2000.

In 1995, Robbins provided all of the voices, including the male ones, in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Caribou Kitchen&quot;.

During the 1990s, Robbins performed a number of different roles as both an impersonator and a singer in the BBC Radio 4 satirical comedy series &quot;A Look Back at the Nineties&quot; and its sequel series &quot;A Look Back at the Future&quot;.

Robbins also provided the English language dubbing for Europeans, featured on the Channel 4 series &quot;Eurotrash&quot; and, in 2006, made two appearances on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Just a Minute&quot;.

In 2007, Robbins was awarded an Honorary Bachelor of Arts degree from Bedfordshire University, for her lifetime contribution to the Performing Arts.

In December 2010, Robbins released her third album, a jazz based affair, entitled &quot;Soho Nights&quot;, which was written as a collaboration with the Italian saxophonist Alessandro Tomei, and recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London.

Robbins also co-wrote the easy listening album &quot;We&#x27;re Just Passing Through&quot; with broadcaster and journalist Nicky Campbell, which was released in 2014.

Robbins was one of the &quot;Grumpy Old Women&quot; tour in 2014 with comedian Jenny Eclair and actress Susie Blake which toured again in 2015.

==Film and television work==
Robbins has acted in many feature films.

She was named Best Supporting Actress at the Angel Awards of the Monaco International Film Festival, for her role as Kathleen in the low-budget British film, &quot;Fated&quot;.

In 2005, she played Joan in &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot;.

The following year she appeared with James Franco and Jean Reno in the film &quot;Flyboys&quot;, playing the role of Clarisse, a brothel Madame.

In the comedy &quot;Lunchbox&quot; she starred as man-hungry teacher, Suzanne.

She also starred in Farrena Films&#x27; comedy-thriller short movie &quot;The Other Side with Valerie Hope&quot;.

Robbins appeared in two series of the comedy series &quot;Dinnerladies&quot;, playing the character Babs, a friend of Petula Gordeno, played by Julie Walters, BBC.

Robbins later appeared with the sitcom&#x27;s writer Victoria Wood in the Christmas special &quot;Victoria Wood with All the Trimmings&quot; and &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s Big Fat Documentary&quot;.

Alongside daughter Emily Atack, Robbins appeared on &quot;Celebrity Gogglebox&quot; and is a regular contributor on &quot;Steph&#x27;s Packed Lunch&quot; for Channel 4.

Robbins has worked on many comedy and drama TV shows on the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Netflix, and can also be heard as a voice-over artist on many commercials.

She was the Edith Piaf soundalike on a lager advert. 
She was the &#x27;Doris Day&#x27; voice in a Waitrose commercial. 
Her singing can be heard on television advertisements for Clover, Debenhams, First Choice Holidays and many more. She also recorded the Capital Radio jingle package for Sue Manning Productions.

She also played Singing Ring in the mini-series &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot;, which aired in 2000.

==Personal life==
Robbins divorced musician Keith Atack in 2007 after 19 years of marriage. The couple had three children: actress Emily Atack (born 1989); Martha Atack (born 1991), a Talent Director; and George Atack (born 1992), a musician and TV researcher.

<doc id="266443" wikidata="Q953045" url="?curid=266443" title="Metalworking">
<text>Metalworking is the process of shaping and reshaping metals in order to create useful objects, parts, assemblies, and large scale structures. As a term, it covers a wide and diverse range of processes, skills, and tools for producing objects on every scale: from huge ships, buildings, and bridges, down to precise engine parts and delicate jewelry.

The historical roots of metalworking predate recorded history; its use spans cultures, civilizations and millennia. It has evolved from shaping soft, native metals like gold with simple hand tools, through the smelting of ores and hot forging of harder metals like iron, up to and including highly technical modern processes such as machining and welding. It has been used as an industry, a driver of trade, individual hobbies, and in the creation of art; it can be regarded as both a science and a craft.

Modern metalworking processes, though diverse and specialized, can be categorized into one of three broad areas known as forming, cutting, or joining processes. Modern metalworking workshops, typically known as machine shops, hold a wide variety of specialized or general-use machine tools capable of creating highly precise, useful products. Many simpler metalworking techniques, such as blacksmithing, are no longer economically competitive on a large scale in developed countries; some of them are still in use in less developed countries, for artisanal or hobby work, or for historical reenactment.

==Prehistory==
The oldest archaeological evidence of copper mining and working was the discovery of a copper pendant in northern Iraq from 8,700 BCE. The earliest substantiated and dated evidence of metalworking in the Americas was the processing of copper in Wisconsin, near Lake Michigan. Copper was hammered until it became brittle, then heated so it could be worked further. In America, this technology is dated to about 4000–5000 BCE. The oldest gold artifacts in the world come from the Bulgarian Varna Necropolis and date from 4450 BCE.

Not all metal required fire to obtain it or work it. Isaac Asimov speculated that gold was the &quot;first metal&quot;. His reasoning being, that, by its chemistry, it is found in nature as nuggets of pure gold. In other words, gold, as rare as it is, is sometimes found in nature as a native metal. Some metals can also be found in meteors. Almost all other metals are found in ores, a mineral-bearing rock, that require heat or some other process to liberate the metal. Another feature of gold is that it is workable as it is found, meaning that no technology beyond a stone hammer and anvil is needed to work the metal. This is a result of gold&#x27;s properties of malleability and ductility. The earliest tools were stone, bone, wood, and sinew, all of which sufficed to work gold.

At some unknown time, the process of liberating metals from rock by heat became known, and rocks rich in copper, tin, and lead came into demand. These ores were mined wherever they were recognized. Remnants of such ancient mines have been found all over Southwestern Asia. Metalworking was being carried out by the South Asian inhabitants of Mehrgarh between 7000 and 3300 BCE. The end of the beginning of metalworking occurs sometime around 6000 BCE when copper smelting became common in Southwestern Asia.

Ancient civilisations knew of seven metals. Here they are arranged in order of their oxidation potential (in volts):

*Iron +0.44 V,
*Tin +0.14 V
*Lead +0.13 V
*Copper −0.34 V
*Mercury −0.79 V
*Silver −0.80 V
*Gold −1.50 V.

The oxidation potential is important because it is one indicator of how tightly bound to the ore the metal is likely to be. As can be seen, iron is significantly higher than the other six metals while gold is dramatically lower than the six above it. Gold&#x27;s low oxidation is one of the main reasons that gold is found in nuggets. These nuggets are relatively pure gold and are workable as they are found.

Copper ore, being relatively abundant, and tin ore became the next important substances in the story of metalworking. Using heat to smelt copper from ore, a great deal of copper was produced. It was used for both jewelry and simple tools. However, copper by itself was too soft for tools requiring edges and stiffness. At some point tin was added into the molten copper and bronze was developed thereby. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin. Bronze was an important advance because it had the edge-durability and stiffness that pure copper lacked. Until the advent of iron, bronze was the most advanced metal for tools and weapons in common use (see Bronze Age for more detail).

Outside Southwestern Asia, these same advances and materials were being discovered and used around the world. People in China and Great Britain began using bronze with little time being devoted to copper. Japanese began the use of bronze and iron almost simultaneously. In the Americas it was different. Although the peoples of the Americas knew of metals, it was not until the European colonisation that metalworking for tools and weapons became common. Jewelry and art were the principal uses of metals in the Americas prior to European influence.

About 2700 BCE, production of bronze was common in locales where the necessary materials could be assembled for smelting, heating, and working the metal. Iron was beginning to be smelted and began its emergence as an important metal for tools and weapons. The period that followed became known as the Iron Age.

==History==

By the historical periods of the Pharaohs in Egypt, the Vedic Kings in India, the Tribes of Israel, and the Maya civilization in North America, among other ancient populations, precious metals began to have value attached to them. In some cases rules for ownership, distribution, and trade were created, enforced, and agreed upon by the respective peoples. By the above periods metalworkers were very skilled at creating objects of adornment, religious artifacts, and trade instruments of precious metals (non-ferrous), as well as weaponry usually of ferrous metals and/or alloys. These skills were well executed. The techniques were practiced by artisans, blacksmiths, atharvavedic practitioners, alchemists, and other categories of metalworkers around the globe. For example, the granulation technique was employed by numerous ancient cultures before the historic record shows people traveled to far regions to share this process. Metalsmiths today still use this and many other ancient techniques.

As time progressed, metal objects became more common, and ever more complex. The need to further acquire and work metals grew in importance. Skills related to extracting metal ores from the earth began to evolve, and metalsmiths became more knowledgeable. Metalsmiths became important members of society. Fates and economies of entire civilizations were greatly affected by the availability of metals and metalsmiths. The metalworker depends on the extraction of precious metals to make jewelry, build more efficient electronics, and for industrial and technological applications from construction to shipping containers to rail, and air transport. Without metals, goods and services would cease to move around the globe on the scale we know today.

==General processes==

Metalworking generally is divided into three categories: &quot;forming&quot;, &quot;cutting&quot;, and &quot;joining&quot;. Most metal cutting is done by high speed steel tools or carbide tools. Each of these categories contains various processes.

Prior to most operations, the metal must be marked out and/or measured, depending on the desired finished product.

&quot;Marking out&quot; (also known as layout) is the process of transferring a design or pattern to a workpiece and is the first step in the handcraft of metalworking. It is performed in many industries or hobbies, although in industry, the repetition eliminates the need to mark out every individual piece. In the metal trades area, marking out consists of transferring the engineer&#x27;s plan to the workpiece in preparation for the next step, machining or manufacture.

&quot;Calipers&quot; are hand tools designed to precisely measure the distance between two points. Most calipers have two sets of flat, parallel edges used for inner or outer diameter measurements. These calipers can be accurate to within one-thousandth of an inch (25.4 μm). Different types of calipers have different mechanisms for displaying the distance measured. Where larger objects need to be measured with less precision, a tape measure is often used.

== Casting ==
Casting achieves a specific form by pouring molten metal into a mold and allowing it to cool, with no mechanical force. Forms of casting include:
* Investment casting (called lost wax casting in art)
* Centrifugal casting
* Die casting
* Sand casting
* Shell casting
* Spin casting

==Forming processes==
These &quot;forming&quot; processes modify metal or workpiece by deforming the object, that is, without removing any material. Forming is done with a system of mechanical forces and, especially for bulk metal forming, with heat.

===Bulk forming processes===

Plastic deformation involves using heat or pressure to make a workpiece more conductive to mechanical force. Historically, this and casting were done by blacksmiths, though today the process has been industrialized. In bulk metal forming, the workpiece is generally heated up.
* Cold sizing
* Extrusion
* Drawing
* Forging
* Powder metallurgy
* Friction drilling
* Rolling
* Burnishing

===Sheet (and tube) forming processes===

These types of forming process involve the application of mechanical force at room temperature. However, some recent developments involve the heating of dies and/or parts. Advancements in automated metalworking technology have made progressive die stamping possible which is a method that can encompass punching, coining, bending and several other ways below that modify metal at less cost while resulting in less scrap.
* Bending
* Coining
* Decambering
* Deep drawing (DD)
* Foldforming
* Hydroforming (HF)
* Hot metal gas forming
* Hot press hardening
* Incremental forming (IF)
* Spinning, Shear forming or Flowforming 
* Planishing
* Raising
* Roll forming
* Roll bending
* Repoussé and chasing
* Rubber pad forming
* Shearing
* Stamping
* Superplastic forming (SPF)
* Wheeling using an English wheel (wheeling machine)

== Cutting processes ==

&quot;Cutting&quot; is a collection of processes wherein material is brought to a specified geometry by removing excess material using various kinds of tooling to leave a finished part that meets specifications. The net result of cutting is two products, the waste or excess material, and the finished part. In woodworking, the waste would be sawdust and excess wood. In cutting metals the waste is chips or swarf and excess metal.

Cutting processes fall into one of three major categories:
* Chip producing processes most commonly known as machining
* Burning, a set of processes wherein the metal is cut by oxidizing a kerf to separate pieces of metal 

* Miscellaneous specialty process, not falling easily into either of the above categories

Drilling a hole in a metal part is the most common example of a chip producing process. Using an oxy-fuel cutting torch to separate a plate of steel into smaller pieces is an example of burning. Chemical milling is an example of a specialty process that removes excess material by the use of etching chemicals and masking chemicals.

There are many technologies available to cut metal, including: 
*Manual technologies: saw, chisel, shear or snips
*Machine technologies: turning, milling, drilling, grinding, sawing
*Welding/burning technologies: burning by laser, oxy-fuel burning, and plasma
*Erosion technologies: by water jet, electric discharge, or abrasive flow machining.
*Chemical technologies: Photochemical machining

Cutting fluid or coolant is used where there is significant friction and heat at the cutting interface between a cutter such as a drill or an end mill and the workpiece. Coolant is generally introduced by a spray across the face of the tool and workpiece to decrease friction and temperature at the cutting tool/workpiece interface to prevent excessive tool wear. In practice there are many methods of delivering coolant.

===Health effects===

The use of an angle grinder in cutting is not preferred as large amounts of harmful sparks and fumes (and particulates) are generated when compared with using reciprocating saw or band saw. Angle grinders produce sparks when cutting ferrous metals. They also produce shards cutting other materials.

===Milling===
Milling is the complex shaping of metal or other materials by removing material to form the final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of a milling cutter that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [x and y axis] relative to the workpiece). The spindle usually moves in the z axis. It is possible to raise the table (where the workpiece rests). Milling machines may be operated manually or under computer numerical control (CNC), and can perform a vast number of complex operations, such as slot cutting, planing, drilling and threading, rabbeting, routing, etc. Two common types of mills are the horizontal mill and vertical mill.

The pieces produced are usually complex 3D objects that are converted into x, y, and z coordinates that are then fed into the CNC machine and allow it to complete the tasks required. The milling machine can produce most parts in 3D, but some require the objects to be rotated around the x, y, or z coordinate axis (depending on the need). Tolerances come in a variety of standards, depending on the locale. In countries still using the imperial system, this is usually in the thousandths of an inch (unit known as &quot;thou&quot;), depending on the specific machine. In many other European countries, standards following the ISO are used instead.

In order to keep both the bit and material cool, a high temperature coolant is used. In most cases the coolant is sprayed from a hose directly onto the bit and material. This coolant can either be machine or user controlled, depending on the machine.

Materials that can be milled range from aluminum to stainless steel and almost everything in between. Each material requires a different speed on the milling tool and varies in the amount of material that can be removed in one pass of the tool. Harder materials are usually milled at slower speeds with small amounts of material removed. Softer materials vary, but usually are milled with a high bit speed.

The use of a milling machine adds costs that are factored into the manufacturing process. Each time the machine is used coolant is also used, which must be periodically added in order to prevent breaking bits. A milling bit must also be changed as needed in order to prevent damage to the material. Time is the biggest factor for costs. Complex parts can require hours to complete, while very simple parts take only minutes. This in turn varies the production time as well, as each part will require different amounts of time.

Safety is key with these machines. The bits are traveling at high speeds and removing pieces of usually scalding hot metal. The advantage of having a CNC milling machine is that it protects the machine operator.

===Turning===

Turning is a metal cutting process for producing a cylindrical surface with a single point tool. The workpiece is rotated on a spindle and the cutting tool is fed into it radially, axially or both. Producing surfaces perpendicular to the workpiece axis is called facing. Producing surfaces using both radial and axial feeds is called profiling.

A &quot;lathe&quot; is a machine tool which spins a block or cylinder of material so that when abrasive, cutting, or deformation tools are applied to the workpiece, it can be shaped to produce an object which has rotational symmetry about an axis of rotation. Examples of objects that can be produced on a lathe include candlestick holders, crankshafts, camshafts, and bearing mounts.

Lathes have four main components: the bed, the headstock, the carriage, and the tailstock. The bed is a precise &amp; very strong base which all of the other components rest upon for alignment. The headstock&#x27;s spindle secures the workpiece with a chuck, whose jaws (usually three or four) are tightened around the piece. The spindle rotates at high speed, providing the energy to cut the material. While historically lathes were powered by belts from a line shaft, modern examples uses electric motors. The workpiece extends out of the spindle along the axis of rotation above the flat bed. The carriage is a platform that can be moved, precisely and independently parallel and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. A hardened cutting tool is held at the desired height (usually the middle of the workpiece) by the toolpost. The carriage is then moved around the rotating workpiece, and the cutting tool gradually removes material from the workpiece. The tailstock can be slid along the axis of rotation and then locked in place as necessary. It may hold centers to further secure the workpiece, or cutting tools driven into the end of the workpiece.

Other operations that can be performed with a single point tool on a lathe are:

Chamfering: Cutting an angle on the corner of a cylinder.
Parting: The tool is fed radially into the workpiece to cut off the end of a part.
Threading: A tool is fed along and across the outside or inside surface of rotating parts to produce external or internal threads.
Boring: A single-point tool is fed linearly and parallel to the axis of rotation to create a round hole.
Drilling: Feeding the drill into the workpiece axially.
Knurling: Uses a tool to produce a rough surface texture on the work piece. Frequently used to allow grip by hand on a metal part.

Modern computer numerical control (CNC) lathes and (CNC) machining centres can do secondary operations like milling by using driven tools. When driven tools are used the work piece stops rotating and the driven tool executes the machining operation with a rotating cutting tool. The CNC machines use x, y, and z coordinates in order to control the turning tools and produce the product. Most modern day CNC lathes are able to produce most turned objects in 3D.

Nearly all types of metal can be turned, although more time &amp; specialist cutting tools are needed for harder workpieces.

===Threading===

There are many threading processes including: cutting threads with a tap or die, thread milling, single-point thread cutting, thread rolling, cold root rolling and forming, and thread grinding. A &quot;tap&quot; is used to cut a female thread on the inside surface of a pre-drilled hole, while a &quot;die&quot; cuts a male thread on a preformed cylindrical rod.

===Grinding===
&quot;Grinding&quot; uses an abrasive process to remove material from the workpiece. A grinding machine is a machine tool used for producing very fine finishes, making very light cuts, or high precision forms using an abrasive wheel as the cutting device. This wheel can be made up of various sizes and types of stones, diamonds or inorganic materials.

The simplest grinder is a bench grinder or a hand-held angle grinder, for deburring parts or cutting metal with a zip-disc.

Grinders have increased in size and complexity with advances in time and technology. From the old days of a manual toolroom grinder sharpening endmills for a production shop, to today&#x27;s 30000 RPM CNC auto-loading manufacturing cell producing jet turbines, grinding processes vary greatly.

Grinders need to be very rigid machines to produce the required finish. Some grinders are even used to produce glass scales for positioning CNC machine axis. The common rule is the machines used to produce scales be 10 times more accurate than the machines the parts are produced for.

In the past grinders were used for finishing operations only because of limitations of tooling. Modern grinding wheel materials and the use of industrial diamonds or other man-made coatings (cubic boron nitride) on wheel forms have allowed grinders to achieve excellent results in production environments instead of being relegated to the back of the shop.

Modern technology has advanced grinding operations to include CNC controls, high material removal rates with high precision, lending itself well to aerospace applications and high volume production runs of precision components.

===Filing===

&quot;Filing&quot; is combination of grinding and saw tooth cutting using a file. Prior to the development of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces. The skilled use of a file allowed a machinist to work to fine tolerances and was the hallmark of the craft. Today filing is rarely used as a production technique in industry, though it remains as a common method of deburring.

===Other===
Broaching is a machining operation used to cut keyways into shafts. Electron beam machining (EBM) is a machining process where high-velocity electrons are directed toward a work piece, creating heat and vaporizing the material. Ultrasonic machining uses ultrasonic vibrations to machine very hard or brittle materials.

== Joining processes ==
===Welding===
&quot;Welding&quot; is a fabrication process that joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing . This is often done by melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material that cools to become a strong joint, but sometimes pressure is used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld.

Many different energy sources can be used for welding, including a gas flame, an electric arc, a laser, an electron beam, friction, and ultrasound. While often an industrial process, welding can be done in many different environments, including open air, underwater and in space. Regardless of location, however, welding remains dangerous, and precautions must be taken to avoid burns, electric shock, poisonous fumes, and overexposure to ultraviolet light.

===Brazing===
&quot;Brazing&quot; is a joining process in which a filler metal is melted and drawn into a capillary formed by the assembly of two or more work pieces. The filler metal reacts metallurgically with the workpieces and solidifies in the capillary, forming a strong joint. Unlike welding, the work piece is not melted. Brazing is similar to soldering, but occurs at temperatures in excess of . Brazing has the advantage of producing less thermal stresses than welding, and brazed assemblies tend to be more ductile than weldments because alloying elements can not segregate and precipitate.

Brazing techniques include, flame brazing, resistance brazing, furnace brazing, diffusion brazing, inductive brazing and vacuum brazing.

===Soldering===

&quot;Soldering&quot; is a joining process that occurs at temperatures below . It is similar to brazing in the way that a filler is melted and drawn into a capillary to form a joint, although at a lower temperature. Because of this lower temperature and different alloys used as fillers, the metallurgical reaction between filler and work piece is minimal, resulting in a weaker joint.

===Riveting===
&quot;Riveting&quot; is one of the most ancient metalwork joining processes. Its use declined markedly during the second half of the 20th century, but it still retains important uses in industry and construction, and in artisan crafts such as jewellery, medieval armouring and metal couture in the early 21st century. The earlier use of rivets is being superseded by improvements in welding and component fabrication techniques.

A rivet is essentially a two-headed and unthreaded bolt which holds two other pieces of metal together. Holes are drilled or punched through the two pieces of metal to be joined. The holes being aligned, a rivet is passed through the holes and permanent heads are formed onto the ends of the rivet utilizing hammers and forming dies (by either cold working or hot working).
Rivets are commonly purchased with one head already formed.

When it is necessary to remove rivets, one of the rivet&#x27;s heads is sheared off with a cold chisel. The rivet is then driven out with a hammer and punch.

=== Mechanical fixings ===
This includes screws, as well as bolts. This is often used as it requires relatively little specialist equipment, and are therefore often used in flat-pack furniture. It can also be used when a metal is joined to another material (such as wood) or a particular metal does not weld well (such as aluminum). This can be done to directly join metals, or with an intermediate material such as nylon. While often weaker than other methods such as welding or brazing, the metal can easily be removed and therefore reused or recycled. It can also be done in conjunction with an epoxy or glue, reverting its ecological benefits.

==Associated processes==
While these processes are not primary metalworking processes, they are often performed before or after metalworking processes.

=== Heat treatment ===
Metals can be heat treated to alter the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, precipitation hardening, quenching, and tempering:
* annealing softens the metal by allowing recovery of cold work and grain growth.
* quenching can be used to harden alloy steels, or in precipitation hardenable alloys, to trap dissolved solute atoms in solution.
* tempering will cause the dissolved alloying elements to precipitate, or in the case of quenched steels, improve impact strength and ductile properties.

Often, mechanical and thermal treatments are combined in what is known as thermo-mechanical treatments for better properties and more efficient processing of materials. These processes are common to high alloy special steels, super alloys and titanium alloys.

=== Plating ===
Electroplating is a common surface-treatment technique. It involves bonding a thin layer of another metal such as gold, silver, chromium or zinc to the surface of the product by hydrolysis. It is used to reduce corrosion, create abrasion resistance and improve the product&#x27;s aesthetic appearance. Plating can even change the properties of the original part including conductivity, heat dissipation or structural integrity. There are four main electroplating methods to ensure proper coating and cost effectiveness per product: mass plating, rack plating, continuous plating and line plating.

=== Thermal spraying ===
Thermal spraying techniques are another popular finishing option, and often have better high temperature properties than electroplated coatings due to the thicker coating. The four main thermal spray processes include electric wire arc spray, flame (oxy acetylene combustion) spray, plasma spray and high velocity oxy fuel (HVOF) spray.

<text>Charles Paul Marie Sabatier (3 or 9 August 1858 – 5 March 1928), was a French clergyman and historian who produced the first modern biography of St. Francis of Assisi. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature five times.

== Life ==
Sabatier was born at Saint-Michel-de-Chabrillanoux in Ardèche, and was educated at the Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris. In 1885 he became vicar of St Nicolas, Strasbourg, but in 1889, declining an offer of preferment which was conditional on his becoming a German subject, he was expelled.

For four years he was pastor of Saint-Cierge in Ardèche, but had to retire in 1893 due to health concerns. He then devoted himself entirely to historical research, spending much of his time in Italy. He had already produced an edition of the &quot;Didache&quot;, and in November 1893 published his important &quot;Life of Francis of Assisi&quot;. This book gave a great stimulus to the study of medieval literary and religious documents, especially of such as are connected with the history of the Franciscan Order. In 1908 he delivered the Jowett Lectures on Modernism at the Passmore Edwards Settlement, London.

Sabatier&#x27;s 1893 book &quot;La vie de St. François d&#x27;Assise&quot; (translated as &quot;Life of St. Francis of Assisi&quot; in 1894) was placed upon the Index of Forbidden Books by the Catholic Church in 1894. Emily Marshall obtained a copy of his book and she came to meet him in the 1890s. He agreed that her ideas for reviving the Third Order were in line with the ideas of St Francis. As a result she wrote &quot;The dawn breaking, and some thoughts on the third order of St. Francis, with translation from the French&quot; in 1896. Her ideas took root in the Anglican church in Guyana. He also published in 1905 &quot;A propos de la séparation des églises et de l&#x27;État&quot;, in 1909 &quot;Les modernistes, notes d&#x27;histoire religieuse contemporaine&quot;, and in 1911 &quot;L&#x27;orientation religieuse de la France actuelle&quot;.

In 1919, Sabatier became professor of Church history at the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the University of Strasbourg. He died in Strasbourg in 1928.

<text>Survivors is a British post-apocalyptic fiction drama television series created by Terry Nation and produced by Terence Dudley at the BBC, that broadcast from 1975 to 1977. It concerns the plight of a group of people who have survived an apocalyptic plague pandemic, which was accidentally released by a Chinese scientist and quickly spread across the world via air travel. Referred to as &quot;The Death&quot;, the plague kills approximately 4,999 out of every 5,000 human beings on the planet within a matter of weeks of being released.

==Production==

===History===
The programme ran for three series and 38 episodes (series 1 and 2 comprised 13 episodes each, the third series just 12; budget cuts and technical problems reduced the planned last double episode to a single, as some scenes were lost during shooting). All series were broadcast on Wednesday evenings on BBC 1, from April 1975 to June 1977. Writer Terry Nation (whose work included many scripts for &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;) created the series, but he left the show after the first series due to disputes with producer Terence Dudley.

The series&#x27; main actors included Carolyn Seymour (Abby), Lucy Fleming (Jenny), Ian McCulloch (Greg), and Denis Lill (Charles). The child actor Stephen Dudley (John) was given his part by his father, the show&#x27;s producer Terence Dudley; while the child actress Tanya Ronder (who in series 1 and 2 played Lizzie) is the daughter of Jack Ronder, who wrote eight episodes of &quot;Survivors&quot;. In addition, the few appearances of Greg and Jenny&#x27;s baby son Paul on &quot;Survivors&quot; saw Lucy Fleming&#x27;s real-life son Diggory appear as Paul, although uncredited. Notable guest stars in the series included Patrick Troughton, Peter Jeffrey, Brian Blessed, George Baker, Philip Madoc, Bryan Pringle, Iain Cuthbertson, Peter Bowles, Kevin McNally, Robert Fyfe, Denis Lawson, David Neilson, Peter Duncan, June Brown, David Troughton, and Roger Lloyd-Pack.

In a High Court case in the mid-1970s, which was abandoned by both sides due to escalating costs, writer Brian Clemens claimed that he had told Terry Nation the concept for the series in the late 1960s and had registered the idea with the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain in 1965. Nation strenuously denied this.

A BBC Four documentary, entitled &quot;The Cult of... Survivors&quot;, featuring interviews with actors Lucy Fleming, Ian McCulloch, and Carolyn Seymour, director Pennant Roberts, and scriptwriter Martin Worth, was broadcast on 5 December 2006, as part of the channel&#x27;s &quot;Science Fiction Britannia&quot; series.

===Locations===

The majority of the locations for all three series of &quot;Survivors&quot; were in the Welsh Marches, the counties of Monmouthshire, Shropshire, Powys, and, for the first two series, the characters most often seen in Herefordshire. The first episode of series 1 (&quot;The Fourth Horseman&quot;) featured several locations in Worcestershire, including Great Malvern railway station. Much of episode 2, &quot;Genesis&quot;, was filmed around the village of Rose, Cornwall. Later episodes had the characters move around Herefordshire, from places like Ross-on-Wye to Welsh Newton Common. Llanarth Court in Monmouthshire was also featured. Brockhampton Court near How Caple, Herefordshire was used as &quot;Waterhouse&quot; in the episode &quot;Garland&#x27;s War&quot;. Towards the end of the first series, the action moved to a more permanent base at Hampton Court, again in Herefordshire. (This was the property referred to as &quot;The Grange&quot; by the characters.)

For the beginning of series 2 the focus moved to a new location, at Callow Hill Farm, near Monmouth (but again just within Herefordshire), as &quot;Whitecross&quot;. The &quot;Lights of London&quot; episodes featured Hanwell railway station, The Oval, and other locations in London, while the Waterloo &amp; City line and the Camden Town deep-level shelter were used to represent parts of the London Underground. The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal and village of Skenfrith also made appearances.

During series 3, production occasionally moved further afield to Suffolk, Derbyshire, and Wiltshire, with the last episode filmed in the Scottish Highlands. Extensive use was made of the Severn Valley Railway.

There are a great number of technical and continuity errors visible as the series was shot quickly on early video cameras, which did not work well in the gloomy conditions in which much of the programme was shot. Two cameras were used, but one of them had a recurrent fault, which shows as multiple reflections on the left hand side of pictures in many scenes, particularly visible in series 3. Primitive equipment meant that many shots suffered from a green tint. Due to audience complaints about this, the production crew replaced the cameras.

===2008 version===

In 2008, the BBC began airing a new version of &quot;Survivors&quot;, with Adrian Hodges as the main writer. In the credits, this version is said to be based on Terry Nation&#x27;s novel &quot;Survivors&quot; (1976), rather than the previous series. This statement was made to avoid copyright problems, as the rights to the television series were vested with a different legal entity from the rights to the book.

The principal characters of Abby, Greg, Jenny and Tom Price were retained, but new elements were introduced, including a subplot about the origins of the virus and a stronger focus on action. The show took pains to make sure these characters represented a broader spread of racial and social backgrounds. The show received mixed reviews, but initial viewing figures were strong.

The 2008 series ran for two seasons, and the BBC announced in April 2010 that there would be no third series.

===Audio drama version===
In June 2014, Big Finish Productions released the first four-episode volume of an audio drama expansion of &quot;Survivors,&quot; with Seymour, McCulloch, and Fleming reprising their screen roles. The second and third volumes were released in 2015, and the fourth and fifth in 2016, with sixth and seventh volumes scheduled for 2017. On 21 December 2016, Big Finish announced an eighth and ninth volume to be released in 2018.

==Series overview==
==Episodes==
===Series 1 (1975)===
As the world&#x27;s population is almost annihilated by a mysterious pandemic, accidentally unleashed by an unnamed Chinese scientist, the crisis is first seen through the eyes of two characters—Jenny Richards, a young working woman in London who is naturally immune to the disease, and Abby Grant, a middle-class corporate wife living a comfortable existence in a suburban commuter village who caught the virus but barely recovered, while her husband died. As Abby goes in search of her son Peter, who was away at boarding school when the pandemic occurred, Jenny wanders aimlessly through the countryside.

Other major characters introduced in the first few episodes are the resourceful engineer Greg Preston, the shifty Welshman Tom Price, and two children, John Millon and Lizzie Willoughby. Abby, Jenny, and Greg eventually come together and realise they must start again from scratch now that the civilisation they once knew has been destroyed. After several adventures on the road, they find a property called The Grange which they can use as a base and, joined by other survivors, they form a potted community of disparate individuals all united by a shared purpose; to relearn the old skills of farming and tool-making, and to try to live in this new world.

===Series 2 (1976)===
Having received word that her son is still alive, Abby has left the Grange to resume her search. Meanwhile, the community is devastated by a fire that kills many, including Emma, Charmian and Vic. The survivors join another community, Whitecross, run by Charles Vaughan, and become once more focused on the everyday practicalities of post-Death life. New major characters comprising the Whitecross band are Charles&#x27; partner Pet Simpson, travelling doctor Ruth Anderson and farmyard labourer Hubert Goss. Frequent visitors to Whitecross, both friendly and hostile, act as catalysts for various dramatic situations. Finally, the arrival of Norwegian survivors brings the possibility of re-establishing worldwide contact and technology. To achieve this, Greg departs Whitecross in a hot air balloon bound for Norway.

===Series 3 (1977)===
Having received word that Greg has returned to England from Norway and is injured, Charles and Jenny set out on horseback to find him. Warned by Jack that Charles and Jenny should turn back as they&#x27;re heading into danger, Hubert sets out on horseback after Charles and Jenny. The trio&#x27;s journey will take them right across what is left of the United Kingdom as their search leads them to various dead ends. However, they meet a broad spectrum of other survivors along the way, and the series continues to explore alternative reactions to the Death and what it takes to survive. The third series juxtaposes the personal story arc of the search for Greg with a wider narrative of society appearing to re-establish itself, with federated communities, market bartering and rudimentary railway travel, based on using the steam locomotives preserved on heritage railways. This culminates in the tentative return of law and order, and the quest to restore power through hydroelectricity.

<text>A coilgun is a type of mass driver consisting of one or more coils used as electromagnets in the configuration of a linear motor that accelerate a ferromagnetic or conducting projectile to high velocity. In almost all coilgun configurations, the coils and the gun barrel are arranged on a common axis. A coilgun is not a rifle as the barrel is smoothbore (not rifled).

Coilguns generally consist of one or more coils arranged along a barrel, so the path of the accelerating projectile lies along the central axis of the coils. The coils are switched on and off in a precisely timed sequence, causing the projectile to be accelerated quickly along the barrel via magnetic forces.

Coilguns are distinct from railguns, as the direction of acceleration in a railgun is at right angles to the central axis of the current loop formed by the conducting rails. In addition, railguns usually require the use of sliding contacts to pass a large current through the projectile or sabot, but coilguns do not necessarily require sliding contacts. While some simple coilgun concepts can use ferromagnetic projectiles or even permanent magnet projectiles, most designs for high velocities actually incorporate a coupled coil as part of the projectile.

Coilguns are also distinct from Gauss guns, although many works of science fiction have erroneously confused the two. A coil gun uses electromagnetic acceleration whereas Gauss guns predate the idea of coil guns and instead consists of ferromagnets using a configuration similar to a Newton&#x27;s Cradle to impart acceleration.

== History ==
The oldest electromagnetic gun came in the form of the coilgun, the first of which was invented by Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland at the University of Kristiania (today Oslo). The invention was officially patented in 1904, although its development reportedly started as early as 1845. According to his accounts, Birkeland accelerated a 500-gram projectile to approximately .

In 1933, Texan inventor Virgil Rigsby developed a stationary coil gun that was designed to be used similarly to a machine gun. It was powered by a large electrical motor and generator. It appeared in many contemporary science publications, but never piqued the interest of any armed forces.

== Construction ==
There are two main types or setups of a coilgun: single-stage and multistage. A single-stage coilgun uses one electromagnetic coil to propel a projectile. A multistage coilgun uses several electromagnetic coils in succession to progressively increase the speed of the projectile.

=== Ferromagnetic projectiles ===
For ferromagnetic projectiles, a single-stage coilgun can be formed by a coil of wire, an electromagnet, with a ferromagnetic projectile placed at one of its ends. This type of coilgun is formed like the solenoid used in an electromechanical relay, i.e. a current-carrying coil which will draw a ferromagnetic object through its center. A large current is pulsed through the coil of wire and a strong magnetic field forms, pulling the projectile to the center of the coil. When the projectile nears this point the electromagnet must be switched off, to prevent the projectile from becoming arrested at the center of the electromagnet.

In a multistage design, further electromagnets are then used to repeat this process, progressively accelerating the projectile. In common coilgun designs, the &quot;barrel&quot; of the gun is made up of a track that the projectile rides on, with the driver into the magnetic coils around the track. Power is supplied to the electromagnet from some sort of fast discharge storage device, typically a battery, or capacitors (one per electromagnet), designed for fast energy discharge. A diode is used to protect polarity sensitive components (such as semiconductors or electrolytic capacitors) from damage due to inverse polarity of the voltage after turning off the coil.

Many hobbyists use low-cost rudimentary designs to experiment with coilguns, for example using photoflash capacitors from a disposable camera, or a capacitor from a standard cathode-ray tube television as the energy source, and a low inductance coil to propel the projectile forward.

=== Non-ferromagnetic projectiles ===

Some designs have non-ferromagnetic projectiles, of materials such as aluminium or copper, with the armature of the projectile acting as an electromagnet with internal current induced by pulses of the acceleration coils. A superconducting coilgun called a &quot;quench gun&quot; could be created by successively quenching a line of adjacent coaxial superconducting coils forming a gun barrel, generating a wave of magnetic field gradient traveling at any desired speed. A traveling superconducting coil might be made to ride this wave like a surfboard. The device would be a mass driver or linear synchronous motor with the propulsion energy stored directly in the drive coils. Another method would have non-superconducting acceleration coils and propulsion energy stored outside them but a projectile with superconducting magnets.

Though the cost of power switching and other factors can limit projectile energy, a notable benefit of some coilgun designs over simpler railguns is avoiding an intrinsic velocity limit from hypervelocity physical contact and erosion. By having the projectile pulled towards or levitated within the center of the coils as it is accelerated, no physical friction with the walls of the bore occurs. If the bore is a total vacuum (such as a tube with a plasma window), there is no friction at all, which helps prolong the period of reusability.

=== Switching ===
One main obstacle in coilgun design is switching the power through the coils. There are several common solutions—the simplest (and probably least effective) is the spark gap, which releases the stored energy through the coil when the voltage reaches a certain threshold. A better option is to use solid-state switches; these include IGBTs or power MOSFETs (which can be switched off mid-pulse) and SCRs (which release all stored energy before turning off).

A quick-and-dirty method for switching, especially for those using a flash camera for the main components, is to use the flash tube itself as a switch. By wiring it in series with the coil, it can silently and non-destructively (assuming that the energy in the capacitor is kept below the tube&#x27;s safe operating limits) allow a large amount of current to pass through to the coil. Like any flash tube, ionizing the gas in the tube with a high voltage triggers it. However, a large amount of the energy will be dissipated as heat and light, and, because of the tube being a spark gap, the tube will stop conducting once the voltage across it drops sufficiently, leaving some charge remaining on the capacitor.

=== Resistance ===

The electrical resistance of the coils and the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the current source dissipate considerable power.

At low speeds the heating of the coils dominates the efficiency of the coilgun, giving exceptionally low efficiency. However, as speeds climb, mechanical power grows proportional to the square of the speed, but, correctly switched, the resistive losses are largely unaffected, and thus these resistive losses become much smaller in percentage terms.

=== Magnetic circuit ===

Ideally, 100% of the magnetic flux generated by the coil would be delivered to and act on the projectile; in reality this is impossible due to energy losses always present in a real system, which cannot be eliminated.

With a simple air-cored solenoid, the majority of the magnetic flux is not coupled into the projectile because of the magnetic circuit&#x27;s high reluctance. The uncoupled flux generates a magnetic field that stores energy in the surrounding air. The energy that is stored in this field does not simply disappear from the magnetic circuit once the capacitor finishes discharging, instead returning to the coilgun&#x27;s electric circuit. Because the coilgun&#x27;s electric circuit is inherently analogous to an LC oscillator, the unused energy returns in the reverse direction (&#x27;ringing&#x27;), which can seriously damage polarized capacitors such as electrolytic capacitors.

Reverse charging can be prevented by a diode connected in reverse-parallel across the capacitor terminals; as a result, the current keeps flowing until the diode and the coil&#x27;s resistance dissipate the field energy as heat. While this is a simple and frequently utilized solution, it requires an additional expensive high-power diode and a well-designed coil with enough thermal mass and heat dissipation capability in order to prevent component failure.

Some designs attempt to recover the energy stored in the magnetic field by using a pair of diodes. These diodes, instead of being forced to dissipate the remaining energy, recharge the capacitors with the right polarity for the next discharge cycle. This will also avoid the need to fully recharge the capacitors, thus significantly reducing charge times. However, the practicality of this solution is limited by the resulting high recharge current through the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the capacitors; the ESR will dissipate some of the recharge current, generating heat within the capacitors and potentially shortening their lifetime.

To reduce component size, weight, durability requirements, and most importantly, cost, the magnetic circuit must be optimized to deliver more energy to the projectile for a given energy input. This has been addressed to some extent by the use of back iron and end iron, which are pieces of magnetic material that enclose the coil and create paths of lower reluctance in order to improve the amount of magnetic flux coupled into the projectile. Results can vary widely, depending on the materials used; hobbyist designs may use, for example, materials ranging anywhere from magnetic steel (more effective, lower reluctance) to video tape (little improvement in reluctance). Moreover, the additional pieces of magnetic material in the magnetic circuit can potentially exacerbate the possibility of flux saturation and other magnetic losses.

=== Ferromagnetic projectile saturation ===

Another significant limitation of the coilgun is the occurrence of magnetic saturation in the ferromagnetic projectile. When the flux in the projectile lies in the linear portion of its material&#x27;s B(H) curve, the force applied to the core is proportional to the square of coil current (I)—the field (H) is linearly dependent on I, B is linearly dependent on H and force is linearly dependent on the product BI. This relationship continues until the core is saturated; once this happens B will only increase marginally with H (and thus with I), so force gain is linear. Since losses are proportional to I2, increasing current beyond this point eventually decreases efficiency although it may increase the force. This puts an absolute limit on how much a given projectile can be accelerated with a single stage at acceptable efficiency.

=== Projectile magnetization and reaction time ===

Apart from saturation, the B(H) dependency often contains a hysteresis loop and the reaction time of the projectile material may be significant. The hysteresis means that the projectile becomes permanently magnetized and some energy will be lost as a permanent magnetic field of the projectile. The projectile reaction time, on the other hand, makes the projectile reluctant to respond to abrupt B changes; the flux will not rise as fast as desired while current is applied and a B tail will occur after the coil field has disappeared. This delay decreases the force, which would be maximized if the H and B were in phase.

== Induction coilguns ==

Most of the work to develop coilguns as hyper-velocity launchers has used &quot;air-cored&quot; systems to get around the limitations associated with ferromagnetic projectiles. In these systems, the projectile is accelerated by a moving coil &quot;armature&quot;. If the armature is configured as one or more &quot;shorted turns&quot; then induced currents will result as a consequence of the time variation of the current in the static launcher coil (or coils).

In principle, coilguns can also be constructed in which the moving coils are fed with current via sliding contacts. However, the practical construction of such arrangements requires the provision of reliable high speed sliding contacts. Although feeding current to a multi-turn coil armature might not require currents as large as those required in a railgun, the elimination of the need for high speed sliding contacts is an obvious potential advantage of the induction coilgun relative to the railgun.

Air cored systems also introduce the penalty that much higher currents may be needed than in an &quot;iron cored&quot; system. Ultimately though, subject to the provision of appropriately rated power supplies, air cored systems can operate with much greater magnetic field strengths than &quot;iron cored&quot; systems, so that, ultimately, much higher accelerations and forces should be possible.

== Formula for exit velocity of coilgun projectile ==
An approximate result for the exit velocity of a projectile having been accelerated by a single-stage coilgun can be obtained by the equation

formula_1

m being the mass of the projectile, defined as kg

V being the volume of the projectile, defined as m3

μ0 being the vacuum permeability, defined in SI units as 4π × 10−7 V·s/(A·m)

χm being the magnetic susceptibility of the projectile, a dimensionless proportionality constant indicating the degree of magnetization in a material in response to applied magnetic fields. This often must be determined experimentally, and tables containing susceptibility values for certain materials may be found in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics as well as the Wikipedia article for magnetic susceptibility

n being the number of coil turns per unit length of the coil, defined as m−1

And I being the current passing through the coil, defined as A.

While this approximation is useful for quickly defining the upper limit of velocity in a coilgun system, more accurate and non-linear second order differential equations do exist. The issues with this formula being that it assumes the projectile lies completely within a uniform magnetic field, that the current dies out instantly once the projectile reaches the center of the coil (eliminating the possibility of coil suck-back), that all potential energy is transferred into kinetic energy (whereas most would go into frictional forces), and that the wires of the coil are infinitely thin and do not stack on one another, all cumulatively increasing the expected exit velocity.

== Uses ==
Small coilguns are recreationally made by hobbyists, typically up to several joules to tens of joules projectile energy (the latter comparable to a typical air gun and an order of magnitude less than a firearm) while ranging from under one percent to several percent efficiency.

In 2018, a Los Angeles-based company Arcflash Labs offered the first coilgun for sale to the general public, the EMG-01A. It fired 6-gram steel slugs at 45 m/s with a muzzle energy of approximately 5 joules. In 2021, they developed a larger model, the GR-1 Gauss rifle which fired 30-gram steel slugs at up to 75 m/s with a muzzle energy of approximately 85 joules, comparable to a PCP air rifle.

In 2022 Northshore Sports Club, an American gun club in Lake Forest, Illinois began distributing the CS/LW21, also referred to as the &quot;E-Shotgun&quot;, a compact, 15 joule magazine fed coil gun, manufactured by the China North Industries Group Corp. They project distribution to reach 5000 units per year in the US, and the manufacturer has also unveiled plans to supply the Chinese police and military with units for &quot;non-lethal riot control&quot;.

Much higher efficiency and energy can be obtained with designs of greater expense and sophistication. In 1978, Bondaletov in the USSR achieved record acceleration with a single stage by sending a 2-gram ring to 5000 m/s in 1 cm of length, but the most efficient modern designs tend to involve many stages. It is estimated that greater than 90% efficiency will be required for vastly larger superconducting systems for space launch. An experimental 45-stage, 2.1 m long DARPA coilgun mortar design is 22% efficient, with 1.6 megajoules kinetic energy delivered to a round.

Though they face the challenge of competitiveness versus conventional guns (and sometimes railgun alternatives), coilguns are being researched for weaponry.

The DARPA Electromagnetic Mortar program is one example, if practical challenges like sufficiently low weight can be achieved. The coilgun would be relatively silent with no smoke giving away its position, though a supersonic projectile would still create a sonic boom. Adjustable, smooth acceleration of the projectile along the barrel length would allow higher velocity, with a predicted range increase of 30% for a 120mm EM mortar over the conventional version of similar length. With no separate propellant charges to load, the researchers envision the firing rate to approximately double.

In 2006, a 120mm prototype was under construction for evaluation, though a tenuous time for deployment was then estimated to be 5 to 10+ years by Sandia National Laboratories. In 2011, development was proposed for an 81mm coilgun mortar to operate with a hybrid-electric version of the future Joint Light Tactical Vehicle.

Electromagnetic aircraft catapults are planned, including on board future U.S. Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carriers. An experimental induction coilgun version of an Electromagnetic Missile Launcher (EMML) has been tested for launching Tomahawk missiles. A coilgun-based active defense system for tanks is under development at HIT in China.

Coilgun potential has been perceived as extending beyond military applications.

Few entities could overcome the challenges and corresponding capital investment to fund gigantic coilguns with projectile mass and velocity on the scale of gigajoules of kinetic energy (as opposed to megajoules or less). Such have been proposed as Earth or Moon launchers:

* An ambitious lunar-base proposal considered in a 1975 NASA study would have involved a 4000-ton coilgun sending 10 million tons of lunar material over several years to L5 in support of massive space colonization utilizing a large 9900-ton power plant).
* A 1992 NASA study calculated that a 330-ton lunar quench gun (superconducting coilgun) could launch 4400 projectiles annually, each 1.5 tons and mostly liquid oxygen payload, using a relatively small amount of power, 350 kW average.
* After a NASA Ames study of aerothermal requirements for heat shields with terrestrial surface launch, Sandia National Laboratories investigated electromagnetic launchers for spacecraft and researched other EML applications using both railguns and coilguns. In 1990 a kilometer-long coilgun was proposed for launch of small satellites.
* Later investigations at Sandia included a 2005 proposal of the StarTram concept for an extremely long coilgun, one version conceived as launching passengers to orbit with survivable acceleration.
* A mass driver is essentially a coilgun that magnetically accelerates a package consisting of a magnetizable container with a payload. Once accelerated, the container and payload separate, the container is slowed and recycled to receive another payload.

<text>The New York City draft riots (July 13–16, 1863), sometimes referred to as the Manhattan draft riots and known at the time as Draft Week, were violent disturbances in Lower Manhattan, widely regarded as the culmination of working-class discontent with new laws passed by Congress that year to draft men to fight in the ongoing American Civil War. The riots remain the largest civil urban disturbance in American history. According to Toby Joyce, the riot represented a &quot;civil war&quot; within the city&#x27;s Irish community, in that &quot;mostly Irish American rioters confronted police, [while] soldiers, and pro-war politicians ... were also to a considerable extent from the local Irish immigrant community.&quot;

President Abraham Lincoln diverted several regiments of militia and volunteer troops after the Battle of Gettysburg to control the city. 

The protests turned into a race riot against African-Americans by Irish rioters. The official death toll was listed at either 119 or 120 individuals. Conditions in the city were such that Major General John E. Wool, commander of the Department of the East, said on July 16 that &quot;Martial law ought to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient force to enforce it.&quot;

The military did not reach the city until the second day of rioting, by which time the mobs had ransacked or destroyed numerous public buildings, two Protestant churches, the homes of various abolitionists or sympathizers, many black homes, and the Colored Orphan Asylum at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, which was burned to the ground. The area&#x27;s demographics changed as a result of the riot. Many black residents left Manhattan permanently with many moving to Brooklyn. By 1865, the black population had fallen below 11,000 for the first time since 1820.

==Background==
New York&#x27;s economy was tied to the South; by 1822, nearly half of its exports were cotton shipments. In addition, upstate textile mills processed cotton in manufacturing. New York had such strong business connections to the South that on January 7, 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood, a Democrat, called on the city&#x27;s Board of Aldermen to &quot;declare the city&#x27;s independence from Albany and from Washington&quot;; he said it &quot;would have the whole and united support of the Southern States.&quot; When the Union entered the war, New York City had many sympathizers with the South.
The city was also a continuing destination of immigrants. Since the 1840s, most were from Ireland and Germany. In 1860, nearly 25 percent of the New York City population was German-born, and many did not speak English. During the 1840s and 1850s, journalists had published sensational accounts, directed at the white working class, dramatizing the evils of interracial socializing, relationships, and marriages. Reformers joined the effort. 

The Democratic Party&#x27;s Tammany Hall political machine had been working to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish. In March 1863, with the war continuing, Congress passed the Enrollment Act to establish a draft for the first time, as more troops were needed. In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned they were expected to register for the draft to fight for their new country. Black men were excluded from the draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and wealthier white men could pay for substitutes.

New York political offices, including the mayor, were historically held by Democrats before the war, but the election of Abraham Lincoln as president had demonstrated the rise in Republican political power nationally. Newly elected New York City Republican Mayor George Opdyke was mired in profiteering scandals in the months leading up to the riots. The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863 alarmed much of the white working class in New York, who feared that freed slaves would migrate to the city and add further competition to the labor market. There had already been tensions between black and white workers since the 1850s, particularly at the docks, with free black people and immigrants competing for low-wage jobs in the city. In March 1863, white longshoremen refused to work with black laborers and rioted, attacking 200 black men.

==Riots==
===Monday===

There were reports of rioting in Buffalo, New York, and certain other cities, but the first drawing of draft numbers—on July 11, 1863—occurred peaceably in Manhattan. The second drawing was held on Monday, July 13, 1863, ten days after the Union victory at Gettysburg. At 10 am, a furious crowd of around 500, led by the volunteer firemen of Engine Company 33 (known as the &quot;Black Joke&quot;), attacked the assistant Ninth District provost marshal&#x27;s office, at Third Avenue and 47th Street, where the draft was taking place.

The crowd threw large paving stones through windows, burst through the doors, and set the building ablaze. When the fire department responded, rioters broke up their vehicles. Others killed horses that were pulling streetcars and smashed the cars. To prevent other parts of the city being notified of the riot, rioters cut telegraph lines.

Since the New York State Militia had been sent to assist Union troops at Gettysburg, the local New York Metropolitan Police Department was the only force on hand to try to suppress the riots. Police Superintendent John Kennedy arrived at the site on Monday to check on the situation. An Irish-American himself, Kennedy was a steadfast unionist. Although he was not in uniform, people in the mob recognized him and attacked him. Kennedy was left nearly unconscious, his face bruised and cut, his eye injured, his lips swollen, and his hand cut with a knife. He had been beaten to a mass of bruises and blood all over his body. Physicians later counted over 70 knife wounds alone. He would never fully recover. 

Police drew their clubs and revolvers and charged the crowd but were overpowered. The police were badly outnumbered and unable to quell the riots, but they kept the rioting out of Lower Manhattan below Union Square. Inhabitants of the &quot;Bloody Sixth&quot; Ward, around the South Street Seaport and Five Points areas, refrained from involvement in the rioting. The 19th Company/1st Battalion US Army Invalid Corps which was part of the Provost Guard tried to disperse the mob with a volley of gunfire but were overwhelmed and suffered over 14 injured with 1 soldier missing (believed killed).

The Bull&#x27;s Head hotel on 44th Street, which refused to provide alcohol to the rioters, was burned. The mayor&#x27;s residence on Fifth Avenue was spared by words of Judge George Gardner Barnard, and the crowd of about 500 turned to another location of pillage. The Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets included the office of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. The mob was turned back at the &quot;Times&quot; office by staff manning Gatling guns, including &quot;Times&quot; founder Henry Jarvis Raymond. Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; was attacked, being looted and burned; not until police arrived and extinguished the flames was the crowd dispersed. Later in the afternoon, authorities shot and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street. The mob broke all the windows with paving stones ripped from the street. The mob beat, tortured and/or killed numerous black civilians, including one man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.

The Colored Orphan Asylum at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue, a &quot;symbol of white charity to blacks and of black upward mobility&quot; that provided shelter for 233 children, was attacked by a mob at around 4 pm. A mob of several thousand, including many women and children, looted the building of its food and supplies. However, the police were able to secure the orphanage for enough time to allow the orphans to escape before the building burned down. Throughout the areas of rioting, mobs attacked and killed numerous black civilians and destroyed their known homes and businesses, such as James McCune Smith&#x27;s pharmacy at 93 West Broadway, believed to be the first owned by a black man in the United States.

Near the midtown docks, tensions brewing since the mid-1850s boiled over. As recently as March 1863, white employers had hired black longshoremen, with whom many White men refused to work. Rioters went into the streets in search of &quot;all the negro porters, cartmen and laborers&quot; to attempt to remove all evidence of a black and interracial social life from the area near the docks. White dockworkers attacked and destroyed brothels, dance halls, boarding houses, and tenements that catered to black people. Mobs stripped the clothing off the white owners of these businesses.

===Tuesday===
Heavy rain fell on Monday night, helping to abate the fires and sending rioters home, but the crowds returned the next day. Rioters burned down the home of Abby Gibbons, a prison reformer and the daughter of abolitionist Isaac Hopper. They also attacked white &quot;amalgamationists&quot;, such as Ann Derrickson and Ann Martin, two white women who were married to black men, and Mary Burke, a white prostitute who catered to black men.

Governor Horatio Seymour arrived on Tuesday and spoke at City Hall, where he attempted to assuage the crowd by proclaiming that the Conscription Act was unconstitutional. General John E. Wool, commander of the Eastern District, brought approximately 800 soldiers and Marines in from forts in New York Harbor, West Point, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He ordered the militias to return to New York.

===Wednesday===
The situation improved July 15 when assistant provost-marshal-general Robert Nugent received word from his superior officer, Colonel James Barnet Fry, to postpone the draft. As this news appeared in newspapers, some rioters stayed home. But some of the militias began to return and used harsh measures against the remaining rioters. The rioting spread to Brooklyn and Staten Island.

===Thursday===
Order began to be restored on July 16. The New York State Militia and some federal troops were returned to New York, including the 152nd New York Volunteers, the 26th Michigan Volunteers, the 27th Indiana Volunteers and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia from Frederick, Maryland, after a forced march. In addition, the governor sent in the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York State Militia, which had not been in federal service, and a section of the 20th Independent Battery, New York Volunteer Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throggs Neck. The New York State Militia units were the first to arrive. There were several thousand militia and Federal troops in the city.

A final confrontation occurred in the evening near Gramercy Park. According to Adrian Cook, twelve people died on this last day of the riots in skirmishes between rioters, the police, and the Army.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on Thursday that Plug Uglies and Blood Tubs gang members from Baltimore, as well as &quot;Scuykill Rangers [sic] and other rowdies of Philadelphia&quot;, had come to New York during the unrest to participate in the riots alongside the Dead Rabbits and &quot;Mackerelvillers&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; editorialized that &quot;the scoundrels cannot afford to miss this golden opportunity of indulging their brutal natures, and at the same time serving their colleagues the Copperheads and secesh [secessionist] sympathizers.&quot;

==Aftermath==

The exact death toll during the New York draft riots is unknown, but according to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120 people were killed, although other estimates list the death toll as high as 1,200. Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area:

In all, eleven black men and boys were hanged over five days. Among the murdered black people was the seven-year-old nephew of Bermudian First Sergeant Robert John Simmons of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, whose account of fighting in South Carolina, written on the approach to Fort Wagner July 18, 1863, was to be published in the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; on December 23, 1863 (Simmons having died in August of wounds received in the attack on Fort Wagner).

The most reliable estimates indicate at least 2,000 people were injured. Herbert Asbury, the author of the 1928 book &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, upon which the 2002 film was based, puts the figure much higher, at 2,000 killed and 8,000 wounded, a number that some dispute. Total property damage was about $1–5 million (equivalent to $ – $ in ). The city treasury later indemnified one-quarter of the amount.

Historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that the riots were &quot;equivalent to a Confederate victory&quot;. Fifty buildings, including two Protestant churches and the Colored Orphan Asylum, were burned to the ground. The orphans at the asylum were first put under siege, then the building was set on fire, before all those who attempted to escape were forced to walk through a &quot;beating line&quot; of white rioters holding clubs. To escape, they would need to run through the gauntlet as the rioters viciously attacked them. Many did not manage the escape. 4,000 federal troops had to be pulled out of the Gettysburg Campaign to suppress the riots, troops that could have aided in pursuing the battered Army of Northern Virginia as it retreated out of Union territory. During the riots, landlords, fearing that the mob would destroy their buildings, drove black residents from their homes. As a result of the violence against them, hundreds of black people left New York, including physician James McCune Smith and his family, moving to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or New Jersey.

The white elite in New York organized to provide relief to black riot victims, helping them find new work and homes. The Union League Club and the Committee of Merchants for the Relief of Colored People provided nearly $40,000 to 2,500 victims of the riots. By 1865 the black population in the city had dropped to under 10,000, the lowest since 1820. The white working-class riots had changed the demographics of the city, and white residents exerted their control in the workplace; they became &quot;unequivocally divided&quot; from the black population.

On August 19, the government resumed the draft in New York. It was completed within 10 days without further incident. Fewer men were drafted than had been feared by the white working class: of the 750,000 selected nationwide for conscription, only about 45,000 were sent into active duty.

While the rioting mainly involved the white working class, middle and upper-class New Yorkers had split sentiments on the draft and use of federal power or martial law to enforce it. Many wealthy Democratic businessmen sought to have the draft declared unconstitutional. Tammany Democrats did not seek to have the draft declared unconstitutional, but they helped pay the commutation fees for those who were drafted.

In December 1863, the Union League Club recruited more than 2,000 black soldiers, outfitted and trained them, honoring and sending men off with a parade through the city to the Hudson River docks in March 1864. A crowd of 100,000 watched the procession, which was led by police and members of the Union League Club.

New York&#x27;s support for the Union cause continued, however grudgingly, and gradually Southern sympathies declined in the city. New York banks eventually financed the Civil War, and the state&#x27;s industries were more productive than those of the entire Confederacy. By the end of the war, more than 450,000 soldiers, sailors, and militia had enlisted from New York State, which was the most populous state at the time. A total of 46,000 military men from New York State died during the war, more from disease than wounds—as was typical during the war.

By the end of the riots, there were more than 4,000 soldiers garrisoned in the troubled area.

<text>The Big Impression, known as Alistair McGowan&#x27;s Big Impression for the first three series, is a British comedy sketch show. It features Alistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona impersonating personalities from entertainment and sport. Four series and a number of specials were made by Vera Productions and it was first broadcast on BBC One between 1999 and 2004.

The series has won five awards, including the BAFTA TV Award for Best Comedy Programme or Series in 2003.

==Production==
McGowan and Ancona first met at a comedy club, and later started dating. They worked together on a number of projects, with their first television series being &quot;The Staggering Stories of Ferdinand de Bargos&quot; in 1989. After performing in his own show in Edinburgh in 1998, McGowan was approached by a BBC executive about working on a series, which he wanted Ancona to be involved in. &quot;Alistair McGowan&#x27;s Big Impression&quot; first aired as a pilot on BBC One in 1999, running to a full series in 2000, with the couple splitting up just before filming began. Speaking with &quot;The Independent&quot;, Ancona said working on the series was &quot;exciting but it was tricky and there were some very low points. [...] But, if anything, the tension added a little frisson to some of the sketches and it made the show better.&quot;

For the fourth series in 2003, McGowan&#x27;s name was dropped from the show&#x27;s title.

<text>Eugène Rambert (6 April 1830 – 21 November 1886), was a Swiss author and poet.

==Life==
He was born at Sâles near Swiss Clarens, the eldest son of a Vaudois schoolmaster, from whom he received his education. When in 1845 his father lost his post owing to the religious disputes, Rambert became a teacher in Paris, and later a tutor in England and at Geneva. When the family&#x27;s fortunes improved, Rambert was able to pursue his studies for the ministry, but he was more attracted by literature, and in 1855 became professor of French literature at the academy of Lausanne, and in 1860 at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, where he remained till 1881, when he again became professor at Lausanne.

His principal work, &quot;Les Alpes suisses&quot; (5 vols., 1866–1875; republished with large additions, according to his own scheme, in 6 volumes, 1887–1889), is a mine of miscellaneous information on the subject. He also published several volumes of poetry, as well as a volume entitled &quot;Écrivains nationaux&quot; (1874, republished 1889), and biographies of the pietist Alexandre Vinet (1875), of the poet Juste Olivier (1879) and of the artist Alexandre Calame (1883).

Rambert&#x27;s &quot;Dernières Poesies&quot; were edited (1903) by Henri Warnery, whose &quot;Eugène Rambert&quot; (Lausanne, 1890) contains a critical estimate.

<text>Janet Ravens (born 14 May 1958) is an English actress and impressionist, known for her voice work on &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;.

==Early life==
Ravens grew up in Hoylake, then in Cheshire, on the west side of the Wirral with her father, a local government clerk, and her mother, a nurse. She attended West Kirby Grammar School for Girls, where BBC Radio 4 presenter Sheila McClennon (&quot;You and Yours&quot;) was two years below her. She read education studies and drama at Homerton College, Cambridge and was first female president of Cambridge University Footlights Club in 1979–80.

==Career==
After Cambridge, Ravens became a radio comedy producer. Her first television role was in the ITV series, &quot;Just Amazing&quot;. She joined Jasper Carrott&#x27;s comedy, &quot;Carrott&#x27;s Lib&quot;, in 1983. In 1986, she played the heavily pregnant Vanessa Plowright in the &quot;Tourists&quot; episode of &quot;Farrington of the F.O.&quot; (broadcast 13 March). In 1986, she accompanied then husband Steve Brown on the Capital Radio satirical show &quot;Brunch&quot;, along with DJs Paul Burnett, Roger Scott and comedians Angus Deayton and Jeremy Pascall. In 1994, she spent a year with the RSC. She has done much voice-over work, being the Cadbury&#x27;s Caramel bunny for several years, and was the seductive voice of a can of apple Tango. She has also appeared on &quot;Just A Minute&quot; and I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue on Radio 4, &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, &quot;No Frills&quot;, &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Stuff&quot; and in Dictionary Corner on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; (one of the shows parodied on &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;). She was producer of the Radio 4 comedy &quot;Elephants to Catch Eels&quot;.

===Repertoire===
Ravens has regularly imitated &quot;Newsnight&quot; host Kirsty Wark, Charlotte Green formerly of BBC Radio 4 (with double entendres), Ellen MacArthur (who regularly bursts into tears), Nigella Lawson (with double entendres), Ann Widdecombe (narrating fanciful racy storylines in her novels), Patricia Routledge&#x27;s Hyacinth Bucket, Queen Elizabeth II, a chirpy Sandi Toksvig, a stern-faced Gillian McKeith, Sophie Raworth (with a bemused school-girl grin) and Fiona Bruce (with barely concealed filthy invitations) of BBC News, Anne Robinson of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, Lesley Garrett (often referring to her generous cleavage), Hillary Clinton, Theresa May, Liz Truss and the Geordie-accented Ruth Archer from the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Archers&quot;. She also appeared as the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in an episode of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; although only her voice is heard.

===Other television===
Ravens appeared in a series-three episode (&quot;Monday Morning will be Fine&quot;) of David Renwick&#x27;s series &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; as Pat Aylesbury, one of the neighbours to whom Meldrew turns after being burgled. From 1996 till 2001, she played Janet Grimley, the mother in &quot;The Grimleys&quot;, a nostalgic sitcom set in 1970s&#x27; Dudley.

In autumn 2006, Ravens appeared on the BBC entertainment programme &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; partnered with Anton Du Beke. She was eliminated in the fifth week.

In spring 2007, she appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Truth About Food&quot;, exploring how foods affect behaviour. Also in 2007, she appeared in Ronni Ancona&#x27;s comedy sketch show, &quot;Ronni Ancona &amp; Co&quot;.

She won the edition of &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; on 1 January 2008, the second woman to win, Edwina Currie having been the first. Ravens appeared as Effy&#x27;s art teacher in E4 drama &quot;Skins&quot;.

In February 2010 and November 2017, she was a panellist on &quot;QI&quot;, and in 2012 appeared as Susan in the sitcom &quot;Hebburn&quot;.

===Radio===
In late 2016, Ravens featured in the BBC Radio 4 miniseries &quot;Desolation Jests&quot; alongside David Jason, Rory Bremner and John Bird. The four-part show was written by David Renwick.

==Personal life==
Ravens&#x27;s first husband was Steve Brown but the couple divorced in 1993. She married the vice-president of Universal Music Group, Max Hole, in July 1999 in Richmond upon Thames. She lives in Barnes. She has three sons: Alfie and Lenny by her first husband, born in April 1987 and January 1991, and Louis by her second, born in June 1998.

She is an ambassador for the charity ActionAid and has visited Kenya with the organisation and raised money for it on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;.

<text>Dead Ringers is a British radio and television comedy impressions show broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and later BBC Two. The programme was devised by producer Bill Dare and developed with Jon Holmes, Andy Hurst and Simon Blackwell. Among its stars are Jon Culshaw and Jan Ravens. The BBC cancelled the television run in 2007 after five years. &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;&#x27; return to Radio 4 was announced in 2014.

==History==
The programme first aired on BBC Radio 4 in January 2000. &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; returned to radio in July 2014.

In November 2001 BBC One said it had commissioned a pilot for a television version. The pilot was well received and in August 2002 a full series was commissioned, this time on BBC Two. The TV show ran for seven series and was axed in April 2009. In 2002 the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Arena&quot; broadcast a documentary about the series entitled &quot;Radio Ha! - Meet The Dead Ringers&quot;, directed by Fisher Dilke. It featured interviews with the cast and writers, and behind-the-scenes footage from a studio recording from the eighth series.

<doc id="266466" wikidata="Q208348" url="?curid=266466" title="Octet rule">
<text>The octet rule is a chemical rule of thumb that reflects the theory that main-group elements tend to bond in such a way that each atom has eight electrons in its valence shell, giving it the same electronic configuration as a noble gas. The rule is especially applicable to carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and the halogens; although more generally the rule is applicable for the s-block and p-block of the periodic table. Other rules exist for other elements, such as the duplet rule for hydrogen and helium, and the 18-electron rule for transition metals.

The valence electrons can be counted using a Lewis electron dot diagram as shown at the right for carbon dioxide. The electrons shared by the two atoms in a covalent bond are counted twice, once for each atom. In carbon dioxide each oxygen shares four electrons with the central carbon, two (shown in red) from the oxygen itself and two (shown in black) from the carbon. All four of these electrons are counted in both the carbon octet and the oxygen octet, so that both atoms are considered to obey the octet rule.

== Example: sodium chloride (NaCl) ==
Ionic bonding is common between pairs of atoms, where one of the pair is a metal of low electronegativity (such as sodium) and the second a nonmetal of high electronegativity (such as chlorine).

A chlorine atom has seven electrons in its third and outer electron shell, the first and second shells being filled with two and eight electrons respectively. The first electron affinity of chlorine (the energy release when chlorine gains an electron to form Cl−) is 349 kJ per mole of chlorine atoms. Adding a second electron to form a hypothetical Cl2- would require energy, energy that cannot be recovered by the formation of a chemical bond. The result is that chlorine will very often form a compound in which it has eight electrons in its outer shell (a complete octet), as in Cl−.

A sodium atom has a single electron in its outermost electron shell, the first and second shells again being full with two and eight electrons respectively. To remove this outer electron requires only the first ionization energy, which is +495.8 kJ per mole of sodium atoms, a small amount of energy. By contrast, the second electron resides in the deeper second electron shell, and the second ionization energy required for its removal is much larger: +4562 kJ per mole. Thus sodium will, in most cases, form a compound in which it has lost a single electron and have a full outer shell of eight electrons, or octet.

The energy required to transfer an electron from a sodium atom to a chlorine atom (the difference of the 1st ionization energy of sodium and the electron affinity of chlorine) is small: +495.8 − 349 = +147 kJ mol−1. This energy is easily offset by the lattice energy of sodium chloride: −783 kJ mol−1. This completes the explanation of the octet rule in this case.

== History ==
In 1864, the English chemist John Newlands classified the sixty-two known elements into eight groups, based on their physical properties.

In the late 19th century, it was known that coordination compounds (formerly called &quot;molecular compounds&quot;) were formed by the combination of atoms or molecules in such a manner that the valencies of the atoms involved apparently became satisfied. In 1893, Alfred Werner showed that the number of atoms or groups associated with a central atom (the &quot;coordination number&quot;) is often 4 or 6; other coordination numbers up to a maximum of 8 were known, but less frequent. In 1904, Richard Abegg was one of the first to extend the concept of coordination number to a concept of valence in which he distinguished atoms as electron donors or acceptors, leading to positive and negative valence states that greatly resemble the modern concept of oxidation states. Abegg noted that the difference between the maximum positive and negative valences of an element under his model is frequently eight. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis referred to this insight as Abegg&#x27;s rule and used it to help formulate his cubical atom model and the &quot;rule of eight&quot;, which began to distinguish between valence and valence electrons. In 1919, Irving Langmuir refined these concepts further and renamed them the &quot;cubical octet atom&quot; and &quot;octet theory&quot;. The &quot;octet theory&quot; evolved into what is now known as the &quot;octet rule&quot;.

Walther Kossel and Gilbert N. Lewis saw that noble gases did not have the tendency of taking part in chemical reactions under ordinary conditions. On the basis of this observation, they concluded that atoms of noble gases are stable and on the basis of this conclusion they proposed a theory of valency known as &quot;electronic theory of valency&quot; in 1916:

== Explanation in quantum theory ==

The quantum theory of the atom explains the eight electrons as a closed shell with an s2p6 electron configuration. A closed-shell configuration is one in which low-lying energy levels are full and higher energy levels are empty. For example, the neon atom ground state has a full shell (2s2 2p6) and an empty shell. According to the octet rule, the atoms immediately before and after neon in the periodic table (i.e. C, N, O, F, Na, Mg and Al), tend to attain a similar configuration by gaining, losing, or sharing electrons.

The argon atom has an analogous 3s2 3p6 configuration. There is also an empty 3d level, but it is at considerably higher energy than 3s and 3p (unlike in the hydrogen atom), so that 3s2 3p6 is still considered a closed shell for chemical purposes. The atoms immediately before and after argon tend to attain this configuration in compounds. There are, however, some hypervalent molecules in which the 3d level may play a part in the bonding, although this is controversial (see below).

For helium there is no 1p level according to the quantum theory, so that 1s2 is a closed shell with no p electrons. The atoms before and after helium (H and Li) follow a duet rule and tend to have the same 1s2 configuration as helium.

== Exceptions ==
Many reactive intermediates are unstable and do not obey the octet rule. This includes species such as carbenes, as well as free radicals such as the methyl radical (CH3), which has an unpaired electron in a non-bonding orbital on the carbon atom and no electron of opposite spin in the same orbital. Another example is the radical chlorine monoxide (ClO•) which is involved in ozone depletion. These molecules often react so as to complete their octet. Electron deficient molecules such as boranes also do not obey the octet rule but share delocalized electrons in a manner similar to metallic bonding.

Although stable odd-electron molecules and hypervalent molecules are commonly taught as violating the octet rule, ab initio molecular orbital calculations show that they largely obey the octet rule (see three-electron bonds and hypervalent molecules sections below).

== Three-electron bonds ==

Some stable molecular radicals (e.g. nitric oxide, NO) obtain octet configurations by means of a three-electron bond which contributes one shared and one unshared electron to the octet of each bonded atom. In NO, the octet on each atom consists of two electrons from the three-electron bond, plus four electrons from two two-electron bonds and two electrons from a lone pair of non-bonding electrons on that atom alone. The bond order is 2.5, since each two-electron bond counts as one bond while the three-electron bond has only one shared electron and therefore corresponds to a half-bond.

Dioxygen is sometimes represented as obeying the octet rule with a double bond (O=O) containing two pairs of shared electrons. However the ground state of this molecule is paramagnetic, indicating the presence of unpaired electrons. Pauling proposed that this molecule actually contains two three-electron bonds and one normal covalent (two-electron) bond. The octet on each atom then consists of two electrons from each three-electron bond, plus the two electrons of the covalent bond, plus one lone pair of non-bonding electrons. The bond order is 1+0.5+0.5=2.


== Hypervalent molecules ==
Main-group elements in the third and later rows of the periodic table can form hypercoordinate or hypervalent molecules in which the central main-group atom is bonded to more than four other atoms, such as phosphorus pentafluoride, PF5, and sulfur hexafluoride, SF6. For example, in PF5, if it is supposed that there are five true covalent bonds in which five distinct electron pairs are shared, then the phosphorus would be surrounded by 10 valence electrons in violation of the octet rule. In the early days of quantum mechanics, Pauling proposed that third-row atoms can form five bonds by using one s, three p and one d orbitals, or six bonds by using one s, three p and two d orbitals. To form five bonds, the one s, three p and one d orbitals combine to form five sp3d hybrid orbitals which each share an electron pair with a halogen atom, for a total of 10 shared electrons, two more than the octet rule predicts. Similarly to form six bonds, the six sp3d2 hybrid orbitals form six bonds with 12 shared electrons. In this model the availability of empty d orbitals is used to explain the fact that third-row atoms such as phosphorus and sulfur can form more than four covalent bonds, whereas second-row atoms such as nitrogen and oxygen are strictly limited by the octet rule.
However other models describe the bonding using only s and p orbitals in agreement with the octet rule. A valence bond description of PF5 uses resonance between different PF4+ F− structures, so that each F is bonded by a covalent bond in four structures and an ionic bond in one structure. Each resonance structure has eight valence electrons on P. A molecular orbital theory description considers the highest occupied molecular orbital to be a non-bonding orbital localized on the five fluorine atoms, in addition to four occupied bonding orbitals, so again there are only eight valence electrons on the phosphorus. The validity of the octet rule for hypervalent molecules is further supported by ab initio molecular orbital calculations, which show that the contribution of d functions to the bonding orbitals is small.

Nevertheless, for historical reasons, structures implying more than eight electrons around elements like P, S, Se, or I are still common in textbooks and research articles. In spite of the unimportance of d shell expansion in chemical bonding, this practice allows structures to be shown without using a large number of formal charges or using partial bonds and is recommended by the IUPAC as a convenient formalism in preference to depictions that better reflect the bonding. On the other hand, showing more than eight electrons around Be, B, C, N, O, or F (or more than two around H, He, or Li) is considered an error by most authorities.

== Other rules ==
The octet rule is only applicable to main-group elements. Other elements follow other electron counting rules as their valence electron configurations are different from main-group elements. These other rules are shown below:

* The duet rule or duplet rule of the first shell applies to H, He and Li—the noble gas helium has two electrons in its outer shell, which is very stable. (Since there is no 1&quot;p&quot; subshell, 1&quot;s&quot; is followed immediately by 2&quot;s&quot;, and thus shell 1 can only have at most 2 valence electrons). Hydrogen only needs one additional electron to attain this stable configuration, while lithium needs to lose one.
* For transition metals, molecules tend to obey the 18-electron rule which corresponds to the utilization of valence &quot;d&quot;, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; orbitals to form bonding and non-bonding orbitals. However, unlike the octet rule for main-group elements, transition metals do not strictly obey the 18-electron rule and the valence electron count can vary between 12 and 18.

<text>Juste Daniel Olivier (October 18, 1807 – January 7, 1876), Swiss poet, was born in Eysins in the canton of Vaud; he was brought up as a peasant, but studied at the college of Nyon, and later at the academy of Lausanne.

Though originally intended for the ministry, his poetic genius (foreshadowed by the prizes he obtained in 1825 and 1828 for poems on Markos Botsaris and &quot;Julia Alpinula&quot; respectively) inclined him towards literary studies. He was named professor of literature at Neuchâtel (1830), but before taking up the duties of his post made a visit to Paris, where he completed his education and became associated with Sainte-Beuve, especially from 1837 onwards. He professed history at Lausanne from 1833 to 1846, when he lost his chair in consequence of the religious troubles.

He then went to Paris, where he remained until 1870, earning his bread by various means, but being nearly forgotten in his native land, to which he remained tenderly attached. From 1845 to 1860 (when the magazine was merged in the &quot;Bibliothèque universelle&quot;) Olivier and his wife wrote in the &quot;Revue suisse&quot; the Paris letter, which had been started by Sainte-Beuve in 1843, when Olivier became the owner of the periodical. He also wrote for the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;, which published his correspondence with Sainte-Beuve. After the war of 1870, he settled down in Switzerland, spending his summers at his beloved Gryon, and died at Geneva on 7 January 1876.

Besides some novels, a semi-poetical work on the &quot;Canton of Vaud&quot; (2 vols., 1837–1841), and a volume of historical essays entitled &quot;Études d&#x27;histoire nalionale&quot; (1842), he published several volumes of poems, &quot;Deux Voix&quot; (1835), &quot;Chansons lointaines&quot; (1847) and its continuation &quot;Chansons du soir&quot; (1867), and &quot;Sentiers de montague&quot; (Gryon, 1875).

His younger brother, Urbain Olivier, was also a writer.

<text>Máire Geoghegan-Quinn (; ; born 5 September 1950) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science from 2010 to 2014, Member of the European Court of Auditors from 2000 to 2010, Minister for Equality and Law Reform from November 1994 to December 1994, Minister for Justice from 1993 to 1994, Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications from 1992 to 1993, Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach from 1987 to 1989, Minister of State for Youth and Sport from March 1982 to December 1982, Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1979 to 1981, Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy from 1978 to 1979 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1977 to 1978. She served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Galway West constituency from 1975 to 1997.

==Early and personal life==
Máire Geoghegan was born in Carna, County Galway, in September 1950. She was educated at Coláiste Muire, Tourmakeady, in County Mayo and at Carysfort College in Blackrock, Dublin, from where she qualified as a teacher. She is married to John Quinn, with whom she has two children. Her novel &quot;The Green Diamond&quot;, about four young women sharing a house in Dublin in the 1960s, was published in 1996.

Geoghegan-Quinn was awarded an honorary doctorate of Laws (LLD) by NUI Galway in June 2014.

==Political career==

Her father, Johnny Geoghegan, was a Fianna Fáil TD for Galway West from 1954 until his death in 1975. His daughter successfully contested the subsequent by-election. From 1977 to 1979, she worked as Parliamentary Secretary (junior minister) at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy. She served as a member of Galway City Council from 1985 to 1991.

Geoghegan-Quinn supported Charles Haughey in the 1979 Fianna Fáil leadership election and was subsequently appointed to the cabinet post of Minister for the Gaeltacht. She became the first woman to hold an Irish cabinet post since Countess Markievicz had served as Minister for Labour from 1919 to 1921 in the Dáil Ministry during the First Dáil, and the first since the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922.

In 1982, she was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education. Her tenure was short because the 23rd Dáil lasted only 279 days, and a Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition was formed after the November 1982 general election. In opposition, she became Chair of the first Joint Committee on Women&#x27;s Rights in 1983 and a member of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.

When Fianna Fáil returned to power after the 1987 general election, she became Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach. She had expected a senior government position, and was disappointed. She resigned in 1991, in opposition to Charles Haughey&#x27;s leadership of the party. The following year Albert Reynolds, whom she now backed for the leadership, became Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. For her loyalty to Reynolds, she was appointed Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications. She became Minister for Justice in 1993, in which post she introduced substantial law reform legislation, including the decriminalisation of homosexuality; she was also briefly acting Minister for Equality and Law Reform in late 1994, following the resignation of Labour Party Minister Mervyn Taylor from Reynolds&#x27; coalition government.

When Reynolds resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil in November 1994, Geoghegan-Quinn was seen as his preferred successor in the position. In the resulting leadership election she stood against Bertie Ahern; a win would have made her the first female Taoiseach. On the day of the vote, however, she withdrew from the contest &quot;in the interests of party unity&quot;. It was reported that she had the support of only 15 members of the 66-strong parliamentary party.

At the 1997 general election she retired from politics completely, citing privacy issues, after details about her 17-year-old son&#x27;s expulsion from school appeared in the newspapers. &quot;If his mother had been a homemaker, an architect or a businesswoman, this simply would not have happened&quot; she commented. Other reports suggested that she saw her prospects for promotion under Ahern as poor, and a weak showing in constituency opinion polls indicated her seat could be in danger. She became a non-executive director of Aer Lingus, a member of the board of the Declan Ganley-owned Ganley Group, and wrote a column for &quot;The Irish Times&quot;.

Geoghegan-Quinn was appointed to the European Court of Auditors in 1999, replacing former Labour Party politician and Minister Barry Desmond. She was appointed for a second term at the Court of Auditors in March 2006, and resigned on 9 February 2010.

She was nominated by the Taoiseach Brian Cowen to become Ireland&#x27;s European Commissioner in November 2009, and was subsequently allocated the Research, Innovation and Science portfolio.

In April 2010, after numerous calls were made over several days for Geoghegan-Quinn to surrender her pensions as an Irish former politician—which were worth over €104,000—while she remained in a paid public office, she did so.

In July 2015, it was announced that she would chair an independent panel to examine issues of gender equality among Irish higher education staff.

In March 2021, NUI Galway announced her appointment as chairperson of Údarás na hOllscoile, the University&#x27;s Governing Authority, on a four-year term until 2025.

<text>Barry Desmond (born 15 May 1935) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who was Minister for Health from 1982 to 1987 and Minister for Social Welfare from 1982 to 1986. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1969 to 1989, a Minister of State from 1981 to 1982, a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Dublin from 1989 to 1994, and Ireland&#x27;s member of the European Court of Auditors from 1994 to 2000.

==Early life==
Desmond was born in Cork in 1935 and was educated at Coláiste Chríost Rí, the School of Commerce and University College Cork. He became a trade union official with the ITGWU (which would later merge with other trade unions, becoming SIPTU) and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. His father Cornelius Desmond was Lord Mayor of Cork in 1965–66 and was active in the labour movement. Cornelius Desmond was the President of the ITGWU in Cork.

==Political career==
Desmond first entered Dáil Éireann at the 1969 general election, when he was elected as a Labour Party TD for Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown. He retained his seat in 1973. He was then elected in 1977 at Dún Laoghaire, where he won a seat at every election until he retired from the Dáil in 1989. From 1981 to 1982, he served as Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for Economic Planning, under Garret FitzGerald as Taoiseach. In 1982, after Michael O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s resignation as Labour Party leader, Dick Spring was elected as the party&#x27;s new leader and Desmond was chosen as his deputy.

After the November 1982 general election, Fine Gael and the Labour Party formed a majority government. In the second FitzGerald administration, Desmond was appointed Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health. FitzGerald began a major cabinet reshuffle in February 1986, to appoint him as Minister for Justice; Desmond refused, and Spring supported him in that attitude. The outcome was that he remained as Minister for Health while Gemma Hussey took on the Social Welfare portfolio.

On 20 January 1987, the Labour ministers resigned from the government; this led to the 1987 general election, as a result of which Fianna Fáil returned to office. Desmond did not contest the 1989 general election. On 15 June 1989, he was elected as a Labour Party MEP for Dublin, serving until 1994. He then served as a member of the European Court of Auditors from 1994 to 2000, being replaced by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.

==After politics==
Desmond was elected president of the Maritime Institute of Ireland on 18 November 2006. He remains a member of the Council of the Maritime Institute of Ireland. As president, he oversaw the revision of its articles of association and the securing of €3.2 million in funding for the restoration of Mariners&#x27; Church, Dún Laoghaire, which houses the National Maritime Museum of Ireland.

<text>Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt is the debut studio album by American musician John Frusciante, released on November 22, 1994, by American Recordings. 

Frusciante was previously a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but left in 1992 after he became overwhelmed by their newfound popularity. He became severely depressed, developed a serious drug addiction, and isolated himself in his home to record music.

&quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; combines avant-garde and stream-of-consciousness styles, with guitar, piano and effects on a four-track recorder. It was met with confusion and a mixed response from fans and critics, and sold 15,000 copies by 1996. Two years later, Frusciante rehabilitated and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==Background==
Frusciante joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1988 at the age of 18, and released his first album with the group, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, the following year. The follow-up album, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, was recorded in an empty mansion where the band decided to live for the duration of recording. Frusciante adapted well to the environment, and often spent his time alone painting, listening to music, and recording songs that would eventually make up the first half of the album, &quot;Niandra LaDes&quot;. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was released on September 24, 1991, and was an instant success. The album peaked at number three in the U.S. and went on to sell more than thirteen million copies worldwide. Soon after the album&#x27;s release, Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band&#x27;s newfound popularity. He felt that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were too famous, and wished they were still playing small nightclubs like they were before he had joined. During &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&#x27;s&quot; promotional tour, Frusciante began using heroin and cocaine heavily. He and vocalist Anthony Kiedis often argued before and after performances. According to Kiedis, Frusciante purposely sabotaged the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; performance of &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; by playing the wrong intro for the song and out of key. His relationship with the band had become progressively more strained, and he abruptly quit during the Japanese leg of their world tour in 1992.

==Writing and recording==
After leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Frusciante continued to write and record solo material. He had been doing so since the age of nine, but had never considered releasing his material to the public. That was until several of his friendsincluding Johnny Depp, Perry Farrell, Gibby Haynes and Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmate Fleaencouraged him to release the material he wrote in his spare time during the &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; sessions. Frusciante began working on final cuts of the songs he had been writing, and producing them at his home. According to Frusciante, each song was completed in one take. During this period, Frusciante&#x27;s use of heroin became more extreme; he began viewing drugs as the only way to &quot;make sure you stay in touch with beauty instead of letting the ugliness of the world corrupt your soul&quot;.
During a 1994 interview, a visibly intoxicated Frusciante noted that he wrote the album in order to create &quot;interesting music&quot;, which he felt no longer existed. He felt contemporary artists were not writing material he deemed worth listening to and the mainstream population were settling for mediocrity. Drugs were another significant topic on which Frusciante based &quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot;. According to Frusciante, he &quot;was stoned for every single note [he] played on the album&quot;. He increased his drug use to cope with worsening depression that was caused by leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his subsequent isolation. Several songs on the album deal with his dislike for the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; success, such as the album&#x27;s eleventh track, &quot;Blood on My Neck From Success&quot;.

All the music on the record was written by Frusciante, save for the cover of hardcore punk band Bad Brains&#x27; song &quot;Big Takeover&quot;. The track was intentionally slowed down and recorded melodically because of a pastime in which Frusciante sang punk songs in different tempos: &quot;It was just something I had been walking around thinking of in my head. Sometimes I&#x27;ll walk around singing punk rock songs to myself, but as if they were regular songs instead of punk rock songs, you know, slow it down and make a melody instead of just yelling them out. And then the idea occurred me to record it like a Led Zeppelin ballad with mandolins and stuff.&quot; River Phoenix, a friend of Frusciante&#x27;s, contributed guitar and backing vocals to two songs that were intended be included on the record, but were ultimately left off following his death in October.

&quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; incorporates Frusciante&#x27;s avant-garde style of song composition, with his stream-of-consciousness methodology. It features minimal orchestration, and Frusciante&#x27;s vocals have a &quot;fragile, wispy quality&quot; as described by AllMusic. &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; called it &quot;probably the most fucked-up album ever released by someone who had once played in stadiums.&quot; Frusciante recorded, mixed, produced and mastered the entire record by himself on a four-track tape, and released it on Rick Rubin&#x27;s label, American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; label, originally held the rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante&#x27;s Red Hot Chili Peppers contract. Because he was living as a recluse, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album under his label.

==Cover art and title==
The cover art of &quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; is a sepia photograph of Frusciante in drag. According to Toni Oswald, Frusciante&#x27;s partner at the time of the album&#x27;s making, this choice was inspired by Rrose Sélavy, the feminine pseudonym of Marcel Duchamp—the French painter and writer whom Oswald and Frusciante both deeply admired. Frusciante devised the name &quot;Niandra LaDes&quot; as his own feminine alter ego. The phrase &quot;Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; meanwhile derives from a clothes-exchanging ritual that Oswald and Frusciante often took part in when Frusciante was away on tour; after Frusciante asked what Oswald would wear with his clothes, she would reply, &quot;Usually just a t-shirt.&quot; The phrase &quot;To Clara&quot; in the lower right refers to Clara Balzary, the first daughter of Flea.

==Release, reception, and aftermath==

&quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; was initially previewed by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, who said that &quot;Chili Peppers fans might be daunted by the album&#x27;s elusive experimentalism.&quot; A representative of American Recordings did not foresee the album as being viable in any mainstream music stores, and some retailers went as far as to ban it from being sold. After the album was released, Frusciante played three small performances, and participated in a few magazine interviews to promote the album, explaining in one interview that people would be able to understand his work only if &quot;their heads are capable of tripping out&quot;. At one point shortly after release, Frusciante began searching for a string quartet to play the album with him on tour. The idea was eventually discarded when he could not find a band that &quot;understands why Ringo Starr is such a great drummer, can play Stravinsky, and also smokes pot&quot;. The concept of a tour was ultimately abandoned as well, due to Frusciante&#x27;s diminishing health.

&quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; was met with general confusion and a mixed response from fans and critics. David Wild of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;All in all, [the album is] a messbut definitely a fascinating, often lovely mess. As one might expect of an album titled &quot;Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-shirt,&quot; this is twisted, cool stuff.&quot; Marina Zogbi of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described Frusciante&#x27;s guitar play as &quot;hauntingly lovely,&quot; and said: &quot;There&#x27;s a fine line between brilliant and unlistenable, and Frusciante squarely straddles it here.&quot; The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; noted that while the album was &quot;a stark display of Frusciante&#x27;s acoustic guitar virtuosity&quot; and &quot;eerily beautiful&quot;, the singing was &quot;terrible; his high notes will drive the neighborhood dogs into a frenzy&quot;.

Retrospective appraisal is generally more positive. In a 2003 review by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, critic Christian Hoard wrote: &quot;[the album] sounds like a string of four-track demos. The first part of the album is slightly more tuneful than the more ambient, experimental second section [...] Mostly what you get are Frusciante&#x27;s acoustic-guitar scratchings and stream-of-conscious ramblings.&quot; Steve Huey of AllMusic, who rated the album four out of five stars, said that &quot;[the album was] an intriguing and unexpected departure from Frusciante&#x27;s work with the Chili Peppers [and that] the sparse arrangements of the first half help set the stage for the gossamer guitar work later on.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; (the latter half of the album) contained &quot;pleasant psychedelic instrumentals with plenty of backward-guitar effects&quot;. Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, noted that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing quite so stunning as [Frusciante&#x27;s] magnificent remake of Bad Brains&#x27; &#x27;The Big Takeover&#x27;.&quot; Adam Williams of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said the album &quot;fall[s] somewhere between madness and brilliance&quot;. He went on to compare Frusciante to Syd Barrett, and felt it was a &quot;hint at a deeply cerebral artist looking within for inspiration and creativity&quot;.

Frusciante&#x27;s drug addiction worsened as the years progressed. An article published by the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; described him as &quot;a skeleton covered in thin skin&quot;. He participated in an interview with Dutch public broadcast station VPRO, the first media appearance he made since leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In the interview Frusciante speaks of the positive effects drugs have had on his mind and proudly admits to being a &quot;junkie&quot;. He went on to confess addictions to heroin and crack cocaine, but ultimately described himself as being in the best health of his life. &quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; sold 15,000 copies by 1996; two years later Frusciante rehabilitated and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. In 2017, record label Superior Viaduct reissued &quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; on vinyl.

<text>Johann Gottlieb Friedrich &quot;Frederick&quot; Pabst (March 28, 1836 – January 1, 1904) was a German-American brewer for whom the Pabst Brewing Company was named.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Pabst was born on March 28, 1836, in the village of Nikolausrieth, in the Province of Saxony, in the Kingdom of Prussia. Friedrich was the second child of Gottlieb Pabst, a local farmer, and his wife, Johanna Friederike.

In 1848, he emigrated with his parents to the United States, settling first in Milwaukee, and then Chicago. The following year, his mother died in a cholera epidemic. In Chicago, Frederick and his father had to eke out a living; for a while they worked as waiters and busboys. Frederick soon gave this up, however – because he had enjoyed his voyage to America, he decided to become a cabin boy on a Lake Michigan steamer. By the time he was 21, Pabst had earned his pilot&#x27;s license, and was captain of one of these vessels. In this capacity, he met Phillip Best, the owner of a small but prosperous brewery founded by his father, Jacob Best, in 1844 in Milwaukee. Pabst married Best&#x27;s daughter, Maria, on March 25, 1862.

For the next year and a half, Pabst continued to ply the waters of Lake Michigan as a ship&#x27;s captain, until an accident in December 1863 led to a change in career. While trying to bring his craft into Milwaukee harbor, Pabst&#x27;s ship ran aground. A short while later, Pabst purchased half of Best&#x27;s brewing company.

===Brewing===
In 1864, when Pabst was taken into partnership in his father-in-law&#x27;s brewery, he began to study the details of the business. After obtaining a thorough mastery of the art of brewing, Pabst turned his attention to extending the market for the beer, and before long, had raised the output of the Best brewery to 100,000 barrels a year. The brewery was eventually converted into a public company and its capital repeatedly increased to cope with the continually increasing trade. He became president of the corporation in 1873. Later, the brewing company&#x27;s name was changed to the Pabst Brewing Company.

In 1889, Pabst spent $30,000 to take advantage of prime shoreline along Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin&#x27;s unique location, just north of the city of Milwaukee, by developing a popular lakeshore resort, which he called the Pabst Whitefish Bay Resort.

As many as 10,000 visitors came to the resort on a summer day by horse and buggy, railroad, trolley, or excursion steamer, to enjoy the scenic view, to ride the Ferris wheel, attend daily concerts (double concerts on Sunday), rent row boats, watch outdoor movies, drink Pabst&#x27;s beer, and dine on fine fare, including five types of whitefish netted daily in the adjoining bay. The resort&#x27;s popularity faded in 1914 at the start of World War I and the park was closed. In 1915, the land was subdivided into residential lots.

The brewing company&#x27;s renowned &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; label was introduced in the 1890s. The beer never actually won a blue ribbon. During some festivals (e.g., World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago), Pabst placed a blue ribbon around his Best beer (named after founder Phillip Best), so it would stand out among the others. People would start identifying the beer as the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Instead of correcting the public, Pabst just wisely renamed it. He trademarked the Blue Ribbon in 1900.

Pabst built a 14-story Pabst Building in downtown Milwaukee and also helped organize the Wisconsin National Bank, in 1893. Pabst purchased the old Nunnemacher Grand Opera House, located opposite the Milwaukee City Hall, in 1890, and turned it into the &quot;Das Neue Deutsche Stadt-Theater&quot; (The New German City Theater), but it was destroyed in a fire. Pabst ordered it rebuilt at once and the newly named Pabst Theater opened in 1895. It still is in use today.

The Pabst Mansion along Wisconsin Avenue is a well-known Milwaukee tourist attraction and was the Pabst family home from 1892 to 1908.

===Personal life===

Pabst was married in 1862 and had 10 children. Five survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (von Ernst, 1865-1891), Gustave (1866–1943), Marie (Goodrich, 1868–1947), Frederick, Jr. (1869–1958), and Emma (Nunnemacher, 1871–1943). The Pabsts also adopted Elizabeth&#x27;s daughter, Elsbeth, after Elizabeth died unexpectedly in 1891.

He had two stock farms, one in Wauwatosa and one in Calhoun for raising Percheron horses. The original stock had been imported by him from France.

Pabst was affiliated with Aurora Masonic Lodge No. 30.

Pabst is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

<text>Nevers ( , ; , later &quot;Nevirnum&quot; and &quot;Nebirnum&quot;) is a town and the prefecture of the Nièvre department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in central France. It was the principal city of the former province of Nivernais. It is south-southeast of Paris.

==History==
Nevers first enters written history as Noviodunum, a town held by the Aedui at Roman contact. The quantities of medals and other Roman antiquities found on the site indicate the importance of the place, and in 52 BCE, Julius Caesar made Noviodunum, which he describes as in a convenient position on the banks of the Loire, a depot (&quot;B. G.&quot; vii. 55). There, he had his hostages, corn and military chest, with the money in it allowed him from home for the war, his own and his army&#x27;s baggage and a great number of horses which had been bought for him in Spain and Italy.

After his failure before Gergovia, the Aedui at Noviodunum massacred those who were there to look after stores, the negotiators and the travellers who were in the place. They divided the money and the horses among themselves, carried off in boats all the corn that they could and burned the rest or threw it into the river.

Thinking they could not hold the town, they burned it. That was a great loss to Caesar, and it may seem that he was imprudent in leaving such great stores in the power of treacherous allies. However, he was in straits that year, and probably he could not have done other than he did.

Dio Cassius (xl. 38) tells the story of Caesar out of the affair of Noviodunum. He states incorrectly what Caesar did on the occasion, and he shows that he neither understood his original nor knew what he was writing about.

The city was later called Nevirnum, as the name appears in the Antonine Itinerary. In the Tabula Peutingeriana, it is corrupted into Ebrinum. In still other sources the name appears as Nebirnum or Nivernum.

It became the seat of a bishopric at the end of the 5th century. The county dates at least from the beginning of the 10th century. The citizens of Nevers obtained charters in 1194 and 1231. For a short time in the 14th century the town was the seat of a university, transferred from Orléans, to which it was restored.

In 1565, the town became the seat of a branch of the Gonzaga family, who in 1627 succeeded to the Duchy of Mantua. This line of the Gonzaga Dukes of Nevers itself died out in 1708.

==Geography==

Nevers is situated on the slope of a hill on the right bank of the river Loire.

==Climate==
Nevers has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) in spite of being far inland. In spite of moderate averages, temperatures are highly variable depending on weather patterns, with a temperature amplitude of for its records since 1946. While summer nights frequently fall into the single digits, every month between April and October has reached during the afternoon at some point.

==Main sights==
Narrow winding streets lead from the quay through the town where there are numerous old houses dating from the 14th to the 17th century.

Among the ecclesiastical buildings the most important is the Cathédrale of Saint Cyr-Sainte Julitte, dedicated to Saint Quiricus and Saint Julietta, which is a combination of two buildings, and possesses two apses. The apse and transept at the west end are the remains of a Romanesque church, while the nave and eastern apse are in the Gothic style and belong to the 14th century. There is no transept at the eastern end. The lateral portal on the south side belongs to the late 15th century; the massive and elaborately decorated tower which rises beside it dates to the early 16th century.

The church of &quot;Saint Étienne&quot; is a specimen of the Romanesque style of Auvergne of which the disposition of the apse with its three radiating chapels is characteristic. It was consecrated at the close of the 9th century, and belonged to a priory affiliated to Cluny.

The Ducal Palace (now occupied by the courts of justice and an important ceramic museum) was built in the 15th and 16th centuries and is one of the principal feudal edifices in central France. The façade is flanked at each end by a turret and a round tower. A middle tower containing the great staircase has its windows adorned by sculptures relating to the history of the House of La Marck by the members of which the greater part of the palace was built.

Behind the palace lies an open space with a fine view over the Loire Valley. The Porte du Croux, a square tower, with corner turrets, dating from the end of the 14th century, is among the remnants of the old fortifications; it now contains a collection of sculptures and Roman antiquities.

A triumphal arch from the 18th century, commemorating the victory of Fontenoy and the hôtel de ville, a 19th-century building which contains the library, are of some interest. The Loire is crossed by a modern stone bridge, and by an iron railway bridge.

At the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the mother house of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers, it is possible to view the incorrupt body of Saint Bernadette Soubirous, the famous seer of Our Lady of Lourdes apparitions, which are presented in a gold and crystal reliquary.

==Economy==
Nevers is the seat of a bishopric, of tribunals of first instance and of commerce and of a cour d&#x27;assises and has a chamber of commerce and a branch of the Bank of France. Its educational institutions include several lycées, a training college for female teachers, ecclesiastical seminaries, a school of art (Esaab) and an automotive and transports engineering school (Institut supérieur de l&#x27;automobile et des transports) being part of the University of Burgundy. The town manufactures porcelain, agricultural implements, chemical manures, glue, boilers and iron goods, boots and shoes and fur garments, and has distilleries, tanneries and dye works. Its trade is in iron and steel, wood, wine, grain, livestock, etc. hydraulic lime, kaolin and clay for the manufacture of faience are worked in the vicinity.

The Rossignol Skis  Group produces 89% of its Look Brand alpine ski bindings in Nevers.

<text>An appanage, or apanage (; ), is the grant of an estate, title, office or other thing of value to a younger child of a monarch, who would otherwise have no inheritance under the system of primogeniture (where only the eldest inherits). It was common in much of Europe.

The system of appanage greatly influenced the territorial construction of France and the German states and explains why many of the former provinces of France had coats of arms which were modified versions of the king&#x27;s arms.

==Etymology==
Late Latin , from or &#x27;to give bread&#x27; (), a for food and other necessities, hence for a &quot;subsistence&quot; income, notably in kind, as from assigned land.

==Original appanage: in France==

===History of the French appanage ===
An appanage was a concession of a fief by the sovereign to his younger sons, while the eldest son became king on the death of his father. Appanages were considered as part of the inheritance transmitted to the (younger sons). The word was specifically used for the royal princes holding an &quot;appanage&quot;. These lands returned to the royal domain (the territory directly controlled by the king) on the extinction of the princely line, and could not be sold (neither hypothetically nor as a dowry). Daughters were initially able to inherit the appanages under the Capetian Kings. However, under the House of Valois, Salic law was applied which prohibited women from inheriting.

The system of appanage has played a particularly important role in France. It developed there with the extension of royal authority from the 13th century, then disappeared from the late Middle Ages with the affirmation of the exclusive authority of the royal state. It strongly influenced the territorial construction, explaining the arms of several provinces. The prerogative of Burgundy is also the origin of the Belgian, Luxembourgeois and Dutch states, through the action of its dukes favored by their position in the court of the kings of France.

Primogeniture avoids territorial splintering, which the earlier Frankish tradition of partible inheritance (equal division) suffered from (e.g. under the Merovingians and subsequent Carolingians). But primogeniture creates resentment in younger sons who inherit nothing. Appanages thus were used to sweeten the bitter pill of primogeniture and deter revolt of younger sons by diverting their aspirations of claiming their eldest brother&#x27;s throne. 

==== House of Capet ====
Unlike their predecessors (the Carolingians), the Capetian dynasty&#x27;s hold on the crown was initially tenuous. They could not afford to divide the kingdom among all their sons, and the royal domain was very small, initially consisting solely of the Île-de-France. So the Capetians broke away from the Frankish custom of partible inheritance, to instead have the eldest son alone become King and receive the royal domain (except for any appanages). Most Capetians endeavored to add to the royal domain through incorporation of additional fiefs, large or small, and thus gradually obtained direct lordship over almost all of France. 

Their first king Hugh Capet (elected King of the Franks on the death of Louis V in 987) only had one son, Robert II. But Robert had multiple sons. One of them, Henry I of France, became the first king to create an appanage in 1032, when he gave the Duchy of Burgundy to his younger brother Robert I of Burgundy (whose descendants retained the duchy until 1361 with the extinction of the first Capetian House of Burgundy by the death of Philip de Rouvre). 

Louis VIII and Louis IX also created appanages.

==== House of Valois ====
The king who created the most powerful appanages for his sons was John II of France. His youngest son, Philip the Bold, founded the second Capetian House of Burgundy in 1363. By marrying the heiress of Flanders, Philip also became ruler of the Low Countries.

King Charles V tried to abolish the appanage system, but in vain. Provinces conceded in appanage tended to become &quot;de facto&quot; independent and the authority of the king was recognized there reluctantly. In particular the line of Valois Dukes of Burgundy caused considerable trouble to the French crown, with which they were often at war, often in open alliance with the English. Theoretically appanages could be reincorporated into the royal domain but only if the last lord had no male heirs. Kings tried as much as possible to rid themselves of the most powerful appanages. Louis XI retook the Duchy of Burgundy at the death of its last duke, Charles the Bold. Francis I confiscated the Bourbonnais, after the treason in 1523 of his commander in chief, Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, the &#x27;constable of Bourbon&#x27; (died 1527 in the service of Emperor Charles V).

The first article of the Edict of Moulins (1566) declared that the royal domain (defined in the second article as all the land controlled by the crown for more than ten years) could not be alienated, except in two cases: by interlocking, in the case of financial emergency, with a perpetual option to repurchase the land; and to form an appanage, which must return to the crown in its original state on the extinction of the male line. The (incumbent) therefore could not separate himself from his appanage in any way.

After Charles V of France, a clear distinction had to be made between titles given as names to children in France, and true appanages. At their birth the French princes received a title independent of an appanage. Thus, the Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV, never possessed Anjou and never received any revenue from this province. The king waited until the prince had reached adulthood and was about to marry before endowing him with an appanage. The goal of the appanage was to provide him with a sufficient income to maintain his noble rank.

The fief given in appanage could be the same as the title given to the prince, but this was not necessarily the case.

Only seven appanages were given from 1515 to 1789.

==== Post-Revolution ====
Appanages were abolished in 1792 before the proclamation of the Republic. The youngest princes from then on were to receive a grant of money but no territory.

Appanages were reestablished under the first French empire by Napoleon Bonaparte and confirmed by the Bourbon restoration-king Louis XVIII. The last of the appanages, the Orléanais, was reincorporated to the French crown when the Duke of Orléans, Louis-Philippe, became king of the French in 1830.

The word is still used in French figuratively, in a non-historic sense: &quot;to have appanage over something&quot; is used, often in an ironic and negative sense, to claim exclusive possession over something. For example, &quot;cows have appanage over prions&quot;.

=== List of major French appanages ===

==== Direct Capetians ====
*Henry I gave the Duchy of Burgundy to his brother Robert.
*Louis VI gave the County of Dreux to his son Robert. The lineage of the counts became extinct in 1355, but a cadet line, descended from Pierre Mauclerc, became Dukes of Brittany.
*Philip II gave his son Philippe Hurepel the county of Clermont, then the counties of Domfront and Mortain.
*Louis VIII, by his 1225 will, granted
**the County of Artois to his second son Robert. Artois was lost by Robert&#x27;s male heirs, passing through a female line, and eventually was inherited by the Dukes of Burgundy. Louis XI seized it upon the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, but his son returned it to Charles&#x27;s heirs in preparation for his invasion of Italy in 1493.
**the Counties of Poitou and Auvergne to his fourth son Alphonse. These returned to the crown when Alphonse died without heirs in 1271.
**the Counties of Anjou and Maine to his third son John. They returned to the crown when John died without heirs in 1232.
*Louis IX endowed
**the Counties of Anjou and Maine (1246) to his youngest brother, Charles. They passed to Charles&#x27;s granddaughter, who married Charles, Count of Valois, the younger son of Philip III, and thence to their son, Philip. When Philip inherited the throne as Philip VI, the lands reverted to the crown.
**the County of Orléans to his eldest son, Philip. It returned to the crown when he succeeded his father in 1270 as Philip III.
**the County of Valois (c. 1268) to his second son, Jean Tristan. This title became extinct upon Jean Tristan&#x27;s death in 1270.
**the Counties of Alençon and Perche (1268) to his third son, Pierre. This title became extinct on Pierre&#x27;s death in 1284.
**the County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis (1269) to his fourth son, Robert. Robert&#x27;s son, Louis, was later given the Duchy of Bourbon, which was treated as an appanage, although it was not technically one. Louis later traded Clermont for La Marche with his cousin Charles, Count of Angoulême, younger brother of King Philip V. These appanages remained in the Bourbon family until they were confiscated due to the treason of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon in 1527.
*Philip III granted
**the County of Valois to his second son Charles. Charles was later given the Counties of Alençon, Perche, and Chartres by his brother, Philip IV of France. Valois passed to Charles&#x27;s eldest son Philip upon his death in 1325, and returned to the crown when Philip became King Philip VI in 1328. Alençon and Perche passed to Charles&#x27;s younger son, Charles. A descendant was raised to the dignity of Duke of Alençon. These titles returned to the crown upon the extinction of the Alençon line in 1525.
**the County of Beaumont-sur-Oise to his third son Louis. Louis was later given the County of Évreux by his brother Philip IV. These titles returned to the throne upon the death of Queen Blanche of Navarre in 1441.
*Philip IV endowed
**the County of Poitou for his second son, Philip. This title returned to the throne when Philip became king in 1316.
**the Counties of La Marche and Angoulême for his third son, Charles IV. Charles later traded La Marche for the County of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis with the Duke of Bourbon. His titles returned to the throne when Charles became king in 1322.

==== House of Valois ====
*Philip VI granted
**the Duchy of Normandy to his elder son John. This title returned to the throne when John succeeded his father in 1350.
**the Duchy of Orléans to his younger son Philip. This title returned to the throne when Philip died without issue in 1375.
*John II &#x27;the Good&#x27;, on his departure to England in 1360, granted
**the Duchies of Anjou and of Maine to his second son Louis. This title returned to the throne upon the death of duke Charles IV, Louis I&#x27;s great-grandson, in 1481.
**the Duchies of Berry and Auvergne to his third son John. These titles returned to the throne upon John&#x27;s death without male issue in 1416.
**In 1363, John II granted the Duchy of Burgundy to his fourth son Philip. Upon the death of Philip&#x27;s great-grandson Charles the Bold in 1477, King Louis XI claimed the reversion of Burgundy and seized the territory. It continued to be claimed, however, by Charles&#x27;s daughter Mary and her heirs. When Mary&#x27;s grandson Emperor Charles V defeated and captured Francis I at the Battle of Pavia in 1525, he forced Francis to sign a treaty recognizing him as Duke of Burgundy, but Francis disavowed the treaty when he was released, and the cession was revoked by the Treaty of Cambrai four years later. Charles and his heirs reserved their claims, however, and this reservation was repeated as late as the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, when Philip IV of Spain continued to reserve his rights to the Duchy.
*Charles VI granted the Duchy of Orléans and the County of Angoulême to his brother Louis in 1392. The Duchy of Orléans returned to the crown when Louis I&#x27;s grandson became Louis XII of France in 1498. The County of Angoulême returned to the crown when Louis I&#x27;s great-grandson became Francis I of France in 1515.
*Louis XI granted the Duchies of Berry, Normandy, and Guyenne to his younger brother Charles. These titles returned to the crown when Charles died in 1472.
*Francis I granted the Duchies of Orléans, Angoulême, and Châtellerault and the Counties of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis and La Marche to his second surviving son, Charles in 1540. To this was added the Duchy of Bourbon in 1544. These titles returned to the crown when Charles died without issue in 1545.
*Charles IX granted
**the Duchies of Anjou and Bourbonnais and the County of Forez to the older of his two brothers, Henry, in 1566. He added the Duchy of Auvergne to these holdings in 1569. The titles returned to the crown when Henry succeeded his brother in 1574.
**the Duchies of Alençon and Château-Thierry and the Counties of Perche, Mantes, and Meulan to his youngest brother, Francis in 1566. To this he later added the Duchy of Évreux and the County of Dreux in 1569. Francis&#x27;s other brother, Henry III, increased his holdings still further in 1576, granting him the Duchies of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry and the County of Maine. All these titles returned to the crown upon Francis&#x27;s death without issue in 1584.

==== House of Bourbon ====
*Louis XIII granted the Duchies of Orléans and Chartres and the County of Blois to his younger brother Gaston in 1626. To this was added the Duchy of Valois in 1630. These titles returned to the crown on Gaston&#x27;s death without male issue in 1660.
*Louis XIV granted
**the Duchies of Orléans, Chartres, and Valois to his brother, Philippe in 1661. To this was added the Duchy of Nemours in 1672. These titles passed to his descendants and were abolished during the Revolution in 1790. They were restored to the heir at the time of the Restoration in 1814. At the accession of Louis Philippe, these titles merged into the crown.
**the Duchies of Alençon and Angoulême and the County of Ponthieu to his third grandson, Charles, duc de Berry in 1710. These titles returned to the crown upon his death without surviving issue in 1714.
*Louis XV granted
**the Duchy of Anjou and the Counties of Maine, Perche, and Senonches to his second surviving grandson, Louis Stanislas, comte de Provence in 1771. Louis was further given the Duchy of Alençon by his brother Louis XVI in 1774. These titles were abolished during the Revolution in 1790. When the monarchy and appanages were restored in 1814, Louis had inherited the throne as Louis XVIII, and his titles merged into the crown.
**the Duchies of Auvergne, Angoulême and Mercœur and the Viscounty of Limoges to his youngest grandson Charles, comte d&#x27;Artois in 1773. To this was added in 1774 by his brother, Louis XVI the Marquisate of Pompadour and the Viscounty of Turenne. In 1776, Louis XVI deprived Charles of Limoges, Pompadour, and Turenne, and gave him in exchange the Duchies of Berry and Châteauroux, the Counties of Argenton and Ponthieu, and the Lordship of Henrichemont. In 1778, the appanage was further reshaped, with Auvergne and Mercœur removed and replaced with the County of Poitou, leaving Charles with a final appanage consisting of the Duchies of Angoulême, Berry, and Châteauroux, the Counties of Argenton, Ponthieu, and Poitou, and the Lordship of Henrichemont. These titles were abolished during the Revolution in 1790, but were restored at the time of the Restoration in 1814. They merged into the crown when Charles became king in 1824.

Although Napoleon restored the idea of appanage in 1810 for his sons, none were ever granted, nor were any new appanages created by the restoration monarchs.

==Western feudal appanages outside France==

===Appanages within Britain===

English and British monarchs frequently granted appanages to younger sons of the monarch. Most famously, the Houses of York and Lancaster, whose feuding over the succession to the English throne after the end of the main line of the House of Plantagenet caused the Wars of the Roses, were both established when the Duchies of York and Lancaster were given as appanages for Edmund of Langley and John of Gaunt respectively, two of the four younger sons of King Edward III.

In modern times, the Duchy of Cornwall is the permanent statutory appanage of the monarch&#x27;s eldest son, intended to support him until such time as he inherits the Crown. Other titles have continued to be granted to junior members of the royal family, but without associated grants of land directly connected with those titles, any territorial rights over the places named in the titles, or any income directly derived from those lands or places by virtue of those titles.

====Scotland====
The defunct Kingdom of Strathclyde was granted as an appanage to the future David I of Scotland by his brother Edgar, King of Scots. Remnants of this can be found within the patrimony of the Prince of Scotland, currently Prince William, Duke of Rothesay.

===Kingdom of Jerusalem===
In the only crusader state of equal rank in protocol to the states of Western Europe, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the County of Jaffa and Ascalon was often granted as an appanage.

===Brigantine Portugal===
With the installation of the House of Braganza on the Portuguese throne in 1640, an official appanage was created for the second eldest son of the monarch, the House of the Infantado. The Infantado included several land grants and palaces, along with a heightened royal pension.

==Equivalents outside Western Europe==
===Russia===
The principalities of European Russia had a similar practice; an appanage given to a younger male of the princely family was called &quot;udel principalities&quot; (&quot;appanage principalities&quot;, , see &quot;:ru:Удельное княжество&quot;). The frequency and importance of the custom was particularly important between the mid-13th and the mid-15th centuries; some historians refer to this era as the &quot;Appanage Period&quot; or &quot;Appanage Russia&quot;. The last appange Russian prince was Vladimir of Staritsa.

In the late Russian Empire, appanages for members of the imperial family were created by Emperor Paul I in 1797. By decree of the emperor, the members of the imperial family who were in the line of succession of the throne received civil list payments from state revenues; those not in the line of succession were given appanages from revenues of special estates called an &quot;udel estate&quot; (&quot;appanage estate&quot;, , see &quot;:ru:Удельное имение&quot;). Revenues of appanage estates were created by tribute of state (unlike private owned) peasants who lived on the territory of appanage estates and owned by the imperial family (see &quot;:ru:Удельные крестьяне&quot;). Appanage estates were managed by the Department of Appanage Estates.

===Serbia===
In medieval Serbia, an appanage was predominantly given to a younger brother of the supreme ruler, called a . Its use began in the 9th century and continued into the 14th century, with the fall of the Serbian Empire.

===Indian subcontinent===
In the Indian subcontinent, the (a type of fief) was often thus assigned to individual junior relatives of the ruling house of a princely state, but not as a customary right of birth, though in practice usually hereditarily held, and not only to them but also to commoners, normally as an essentially meritocratic grant of land and taxation rights (guaranteeing a &quot;fitting&quot; income, in itself bringing social sway, in the primary way in a mainly agricultural society), or even as part of a deal.

The seniormost woman in the Travancore royal family held the estate of Attingal, also known as the Sreepadam Estate, in appanage for life. All the income derived from this estate was the private property of the senior maharani, alternatively known as the Senior Rani of Attingal ().

===Indonesia===
The Javanese kingdom of , which dominated eastern Java in the 14th and 15th centuries, was divided into (provinces). The administration of these was entrusted to members of the royal family, who bore the title of i.e. , &quot;lord of&quot; (the word being akin to the Thai ), followed by the name of the land they were entrusted with: for example a sister of King Hayam Wuruk (r. 1350–1389) was , &quot;lady of Lasem&quot;.

===Mongol Empire===
The royal family of the Mongol Empire owned the largest appanages in the world because of their enormous empire. In 1206, Genghis Khan awarded large tracts of land to his family members and loyal companions, most of whom were of common origin. Shares of booty were distributed much more widely. Empresses, princesses, and meritorious servants, as well as children of concubines, all received full shares including war prisoners. For example, Kublai summoned two siege engineers from the Ilkhanate, and after their success rewarded them with lands. After the Mongol conquest in 1238, the port cities in Crimea paid the Jochids customs duties and the revenues were divided among all Chingisid princes in Mongol Empire in accordance with the appanage system. As loyal allies, the Kublaids in East Asia and the Ilkhanids in Persia sent clerics, doctors, artisans, scholars, engineers and administrators to and received revenues from the appanages in each other&#x27;s khanates.

The Great Khan Möngke divided up shares or appanages in Persia and made redistribution in Central Asia in 1251–1256. Although the Chagatai Khanate was the smallest in size, the Chagatai Khans held the cities of Kat and Khiva in Khorazm, and some cities and villages in Shanxi and Iran, as well as their nomadic grounds in Central Asia. The first Ilkhan, Hulagu, owned 25,000 households of silk-workers in China, valleys in Tibet, and lands in Mongolia. In 1298, his descendant Ghazan of Persia sent envoys with precious gifts to the Great Khan Temür, and asked for the share of lands and revenues held by his great-grandfather in the territories ruled by the Yuan dynasty (in modern-day China and Mongolia). It is claimed that Ghazan received revenues that were not sent since the time of Möngke Khan.

The appanage holders demanded excessive revenues and freed themselves from taxes. Ögedei decreed that nobles could appoint darughachi and judges in the appanages instead of direct distribution without the permission of the Great Khan, due to Khitan minister Yelü Chucai. Both Güyük and Möngke restricted the autonomy of the appanages, but Kublai Khan continued Ögedei&#x27;s regulations. Ghazan also prohibited any misfeasance of appanage holders in the Ilkhanate, and Yuan councillor Temuder restricted Mongol nobles&#x27; excessive powers in appanages in China and Mongolia. Kublai&#x27;s successor Temür abolished imperial son-in-law King Chungnyeol of Goryeo&#x27;s 358 departments which caused financial pressures to Korean people, though the Mongols gave them some autonomy.

The appanage system was severely affected beginning with the civil strife in the Mongol Empire from 1260 to 1304. Nevertheless, this system survived. For example, Abagha of the Ilkhanate allowed Möngke Temür of the Golden Horde to collect revenues from silk workshops in northern Persia in 1270, and Baraq of the Chagatai Khanate sent his Muslim vizier to the Ilkhanate in 1269, ostensibly to investigate his appanages there. (The vizier&#x27;s real mission was to spy on the Ilkhanids.) After a peace treaty declared among Mongol khans Temür, Duwa, Chapar, Tokhta and Oljeitu in 1304, the system began to see a recovery. During the reign of Tugh Temür, the Yuan court received a third of revenues of the cities of Transoxiana (Mawarannahr) under Chagatai Khans while Chagatai elites such as Eljigidey, Duwa Temür, Tarmashirin were given lavish presents and sharing in the Yuan Dynasty&#x27;s patronage of Buddhist temples. Tugh Temür was also given some Russian captives by Chagatai prince Changshi as well as Kublai&#x27;s future khatun Chabi had servant Ahmad Fanakati from Fergana Valley before her marriage. In 1326, the Golden Horde started sending tributes to Great Khans of the Yuan Dynasty again. By 1339, Ozbeg and his successors had received annually 24 thousand ding in paper currency from their Chinese appanages in Shanxi, Cheli and Hunan. H. H. Howorth noted that Ozbeg&#x27;s envoy required his master&#x27;s shares from the Yuan court, the headquarters of the Mongol world, for the establishment of new post stations in 1336. This communication ceased only with the breakup, succession struggles and rebellions of Mongol Khanates.

After the fall of the Mongol Empire in 1368, the Mongols continued the tradition of appanage system. They were divided into districts ruled by hereditary noblemen. The units in such systems were called and during Northern Yuan Dynasty in Mongolia. However, the called their appanage unit or . Appanages were called banners () under the Qing dynasty.

<doc id="266502" wikidata="Q572700" url="?curid=266502" title="Bureaucrat">
<text>A bureaucrat is a member of a bureaucracy and can compose the administration of any organization of any size, although the term usually connotes someone within an institution of government.

The term &quot;bureaucrat&quot; derives from &quot;bureaucracy&quot;, which in turn derives from the French &quot;bureaucratie&quot; first known from the 18th century. Bureaucratic work had already been performed for many centuries. The term may also refer to managerial and directorial executives in the corporate sector.

==Role in society==
Bureaucrats play various roles in modern society, by virtue of holding administrative, functional, and managerial positions in government. They carry out the day-to-day implementation of enacted policies for central government agencies, such as postal services, education and healthcare administration, and various regulatory bodies.

==Types of bureaucrat==

Bureaucrats can be split into different categories based on the system, nationality, and time they come from.
# Classical – someone who starts at a low level of public work and does not have to express opinions of their own in their professional capacities. They follow policy guidelines and gain increasing ranks within the system. Tax collectors, government accountants, police officers, fire fighters, and military personnel are examples of classical bureaucrats.
# American bureaucrats – these are different from other types because they operate within a republican form of government, and the political culture traditionally seeks to limit their power. 
# Chinese bureaucrats, also called &quot;Mandarin bureaucrats&quot; – Mandarins were important from 605 to 1905 CE. The Zhou dynasty is the earliest recording of Chinese bureaucrats. There was a 9 rank system, each rank having more power than the lower rank. This type of bureaucrat went on until the Qing dynasty. After 1905, the Mandarins were replaced by modern civil servants. In 1949, the Communist Party took over China, and by their theory, all people were bureaucrats who worked for the government.
# European – originally referred to as &quot;Mandarins&quot; stemming from the Chinese word for government employee. Bureaucracy did not catch on in Europe very much due to the many different governments in the region, and constant change and advancement, and relative freedom of the upper class. With the translation of Confucian texts during the Enlightenment, the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional &quot;ancien regime&quot; of Europe. Voltaire and François Quesnay wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had &quot;perfected moral science&quot; and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese. The implementation of His Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy, followed the Northcote–Trevelyan Report of 1854 which was influenced by the ancient Chinese imperial examination. This system was modeled on the imperial examinations system and bureaucracy of China based on the suggestion of Northcote–Trevelyan Report. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain&#x27;s consul in Guangzhou, China argued in his &quot;Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China&quot;, published in 1847, that &quot;the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only,&quot; and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. In 1958, though, after the formation of the European Economic Community the job of the Bureaucrat became extremely important to help organize and govern such a large and diverse community. In 1961 the term Eurocrat was coined by Richard Mayne, a journalist at the time. A Eurocrat is a bureaucrat of the European Union.
# Modern Bureaucrat – The digital age and the Internet have revolutionized Bureaucrats and the modern Bureaucrat has a different skill set than before. Paper forms and communications that had to be physically written on, moved, or copied are increasingly replaced by technologies such as email and HTML forms, which allow data to be collected, duplicated, and transferred anywhere in the world in seconds. Also, the internet lowers the corruption levels of some Bureaucratic entities such as the Police Force due to social media and pro–am journalism.

==Attributes of bureaucrats==
German sociologist Max Weber defined a bureaucratic official as the following:

* They are personally free and appointed to their position on the basis of conduct.
* They exercise the authority delegated to them in accordance with impersonal rules, and their loyalty is enlisted on behalf of the faithful execution of their official duties.
* Their appointment and job placement are dependent upon their technical qualifications.
* Their administrative work is a full-time occupation.
* Their work is rewarded by a regular salary and prospects of advancement in a lifetime career.
* They must exercise their judgment and their skills, but their duty is to place these at the service of a higher authority. Ultimately they are responsible only for the impartial execution of assigned tasks and must sacrifice their personal judgment if it runs counter to their official duties.
* Bureaucratic control is the use of rules, regulations, and formal authority to guide performance. It includes such things as budgets, statistical reports, and performance appraisals to regulate behavior and results.

As an academic, Woodrow Wilson, later a US president, professed in his 1887 article &quot;The Study of Administration&quot;:

<doc id="266509" wikidata="Q3538748" url="?curid=266509" title="Sailor Malan">
<text>Adolph Gysbert Malan, (3 October 1910 – 17 September 1963), better known as Sailor Malan, was a South African fighter pilot and flying ace in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who led No. 74 Squadron RAF during the Battle of Britain. He finished his fighter career in 1941 with twenty-seven destroyed, seven shared destroyed and two unconfirmed, three probables and sixteen damaged. At the time he was the RAF&#x27;s leading ace, and one of the highest scoring pilots to have served wholly with RAF Fighter Command during the Second World War.

After the war, Malan returned to South Africa. In the 1950s Malan became leader of the Torch Commando, a liberal anti-authoritarian organization that opposed the introduction of the apartheid system.

==Early life==

Malan was born on 3 October 1910 to an Afrikaner family of Huguenot descent in Wellington, Western Cape. He joined the South African Training Ship &quot;General Botha&quot; in 1924 or 1925 as a naval cadet at the age of 14, and on 5 January 1928 engaged as an officer cadet aboard the &quot;Landsdown Castle&quot; of the Union-Castle Line which later earned him the nickname of &quot;Sailor&quot; amongst his pilot colleagues. On 19 February 1932, he joined the Royal Naval Reserve as an acting sub-lieutenant, and was commissioned a sub-lieutenant on 18 June 1935.

==Royal Air Force==
In 1935 the Royal Air Force (RAF) started the rapid expansion of its pilot corps, for which Malan volunteered. He learned to fly in the de Havilland Tiger Moth at an elementary flying school near Bristol, flying for the first time on 6 January 1936. He was commissioned as an acting pilot officer on 2 March, completed training by the end of the year, and was sent to join 74 Squadron on 20 December 1936. He was confirmed as a pilot officer on 6 January 1937. He was promoted to acting flying officer on 20 May 1938 and promoted to substantive flying officer on 6 July. He received another promotion to acting flight lieutenant on 2 March 1939, six months before the outbreak of war.

Malan developed the Ten Rules for Air Fighting for fighter pilots.

==Second World War==

===Battle of Barking Creek===

No. 74 Squadron was dispatched 15 hours after war was declared to intercept a bomber raid that turned out to be returning RAF planes. On 6 September 1939, &quot;A&quot; Flight was scrambled to intercept a suspected enemy radar track and ran into the Hurricanes of No. 56 Squadron RAF. Believing 56 to be the enemy, Malan ordered an attack. Paddy Byrne and John Freeborn downed two RAF aircraft, killing one officer – Montague Hulton-Harrop – in friendly fire, which became known as the Battle of Barking Creek. At the subsequent court-martial, Malan denied responsibility for the attack. He testified for the prosecution against his own pilots stating that Freeborn had been &quot;irresponsible, impetuous, and had not taken proper heed of vital communications&quot;. This prompted Freeborn&#x27;s counsel, Patrick Hastings, to call Malan a bare-faced liar. Hastings was assisted in defending the pilots by Roger Bushell, who, like Malan, had been born in South Africa. The court ruled the entire incident as an unfortunate error and acquitted both pilots.

===Dunkirk===

After fierce fighting over Dunkirk during the evacuation of the British Army from Dunkirk on 28 May 1940, Malan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) having achieved five &quot;kills&quot;. During the night of 19/20 June Malan flew a night sortie in bright moonlight and shot down two Heinkel He 111 bombers, a then-unique feat for which a bar was awarded to his DFC. On 6 July, he was promoted to flight lieutenant.

Malan and his senior pilots abandoned the Vic formation used by the RAF and turned to a looser formation (the finger-four) similar to the four aircraft &quot;Schwarm&quot; the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had developed during the Spanish Civil War. It is believed that on 28 July he met Werner Mölders in combat, damaged his plane and wounded him, but failed to bring him down, though recent research has suggested that Mölders was wounded in a fight with No. 41 Squadron RAF.

===Squadron leader of No. 74 Squadron===

On 8 August, Malan was given command of 74 Squadron and promoted to acting squadron leader at the height of the Battle of Britain. On 11 August, action started at 7 am when the squadron was sent to intercept a raid near Dover, which was followed by three more raids, lasting all day. At the end of the day, 74 Squadron had claimed to have shot down 38 aircraft, and was known from then on as &quot;Sailor&#x27;s August the Eleventh&quot;. Malan himself commented, &quot;thus ended a very successful morning of combat&quot;. He received a bar to his DFC on 13 August.
On 29 December 1941 Malan was added to the select list of airmen who had sat for one of Cuthbert Orde&#x27;s iconic RAF charcoal portraits. He had the rarer honour of also being the subject of a full colour painting by Orde.

===Wing commander – Biggin Hill===

On 24 December, Malan received the Distinguished Service Order, and on 22 July 1941, a bar to the DSO. On 10 March 1941 he was appointed as one of the first wing leaders for the offensive operations that spring and summer, leading the Biggin Hill Wing until mid-August, when he was rested from operations. He finished his active fighter career in 1941 with 27 kills destroyed, 7 shared destroyed and 2 unconfirmed, 3 probables and 16 damaged, as one of the highest scoring pilots to have served wholly with Fighter Command during World War II. He was transferred to the reserve as a squadron leader on 6 January 1942.

After a lecture tour to the USA, he commanded the Central Gunnery School for more than a year. Malan was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 September 1942 and became station commander at RAF Biggin Hill, receiving a promotion to war substantive wing commander on 1 July 1943.

==Post-war opposition to apartheid==

After the conclusion of the war, Malan resigned his commission with the Royal Air Force in April 1946, retaining the rank of group captain, and returned home to South Africa, where he commenced a career in sheep farming. 

Malan maintained his ties to the RAF community however, acting as president of the Royal Air Forces Association’s South African Area and becoming a life-member of its Johannesburg Branch. 

In the early 1950s, he became involved in increasingly volatile South African domestic politics with its radical polarizing atmosphere and racially and culturally divided societal tensions. After the National Party was voted into government in the late 1940s South Africa&#x27;s domestic governance moved to a position of national conservatism and introduced apartheid, which Malan objected to. In the early 1950s in response Malan joined a liberal politically organized protest movement opposed to the introduction of the apartheid system styling itself as the Torch Commando, of which – with his public recognition acquired from his war career – he was elected president. Through the early 1950s he involved himself in political opposition to what he perceived was increasing authoritarianism of the National Party in government, which he felt threatened to become fascist in nature. At one point the Torch Commando (called for its predilection for staging night-time rallies outside government buildings with the protestors bearing flaming torches for dramatic illumination) movement had 250,000 members, and staged well-attended rallies across South Africa, which Malan often publicly addressed. 

By the late 1950s, the movement lost momentum as some of the factions that constituted it increasingly moved from a hitherto public liberal position to one of world communism, and splintered away to join the African National Congress (ANC), with which Malan was not sympathetic. The rise of the ANC and its ideological radical agenda discouraged the majority of the Torch Commando&#x27;s membership from continuing with their campaign against the apartheid state laws, leaving Malan with the disintegrating organization and him retiring from politics and public life, leaving the National Party to rule South Africa for the next four decades.

==Death==

Malan died at the age of 52 on 17 September 1963 from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, at the time a rare and little understood medical condition. A considerable sum of money was raised in his name to further study the disease. His funeral service was at St Cyprian&#x27;s Cathedral, Kimberley, and his body was buried at West End Cemetery in Kimberley, Cape Province. Due to his prominent role in opposition to apartheid, the South African government sought to marginalize the event of his passing in order to further erase any lasting legacy of the Torch Commando. Malan was not permitted a military funeral and all South African military personnel who attended his funeral were instructed not to wear their uniforms. The South African Air Force was instructed not to give any tribute to his passing.

<doc id="266511" wikidata="Q569962" url="?curid=266511" title="Anson Burlingame">
<text>Anson Burlingame (November 14, 1820 – February 23, 1870) was an American lawyer, Republican/American Party legislator, diplomat, and abolitionist. As diplomat, he served as the U.S. minister to China (1862–1867) and then as China&#x27;s envoy to the U.S., which resulted in the 1868 landmark Burlingame Treaty.

== Early life ==
Burlingame was born in New Berlin, New York. In 1823 his parents (Joel Burlingame and Freelove Angell) took him to Ohio, and about ten years afterwards to Michigan. Between 1838 and 1841 he studied at the Detroit branch of the University of Michigan, and in 1846 graduated from Harvard Law School. He was a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Sigma chapter). On June 3, 1847, he married Jane Cornelia Livermore. They had sons Edward Livermore Burlingame (born 1848) and Walter Angell Burlingame (born 1852), as well as a daughter Gertrude Burlingame (born 1856).

== Early career ==
Burlingame practiced law in Boston, Massachusetts, and won a wide reputation by his speeches for the Free Soil Party in 1848. He was a member of the Massachusetts constitutional convention in 1853, of the Massachusetts State Senate from 1853 to 1854, and of the United States House of Representatives from 1855 to 1861, being elected for the first term as a Know Nothing and afterwards as a member of the new Republican Party, which he helped to organize in Massachusetts.

== Burlingame vs. Preston Brooks ==
In May 1856, Senator Charles Sumner (R-Massachusetts) delivered a fiery anti-slavery speech. He was subsequently brutally assaulted in the Senate chamber by Representative Preston Brooks (D-South Carolina), who was hailed as a hero by the pro-slavery South.

Shortly afterwards, Burlingame delivered what &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to as &quot;the most celebrated speech&quot; of his career: a scathing denunciation of Brooks&#x27; assault on Sumner, branding him as &quot;the vilest sort of coward&quot; on the House floor. In response, Brooks challenged Burlingame to a duel, stating he would gladly face him &quot;in any Yankee of his choosing&quot;. Burlingame eagerly accepted; as the challenged party, he had his choice of weapons and location. A well-known marksman, he selected rifles as the weapons and the Navy Yard on the Canadian side of the U.S. border in Niagara Falls as the location (in order to circumvent the U.S. ban on dueling). Brooks, reportedly dismayed by both Burlingame&#x27;s unexpectedly enthusiastic acceptance and his reputation as a crack shot, neglected to show up, instead citing unspecified risks to his safety if he were to cross &quot;hostile country&quot; (the northern U.S. states) in order to reach Canada. Burlingame&#x27;s solid defense of a fellow Bostonian greatly raised his stature throughout the North.

== Diplomatic posts ==
=== Minister to China (Qing Empire) ===
On March 22, 1861, after Burlingame lost his bid for re-election, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Burlingame as Minister to the Austrian Empire, but Burlingame, who had championed the Hungarian Lajos Kossuth and his drive for independence from the Austrian Empire, was not acceptable and did not serve.

On June 14, 1861, Lincoln instead appointed Burlingame as minister to the Qing Empire. Burlingame worked for a cooperative policy rather than the imperialistic policies of force which had been used during the First and Second Opium Wars and developed relations with the reform elements of the court. As he put it, the &quot;cooperative policy... substituted for the old doctrine of violence one of fair diplomatic action,&quot; and the representatives of the Western powers agreed that they would not interfere in the internal affairs of China. Burlingame reported that he had used his diplomacy to get the European powers to agree that they would &quot;give to the treaties a fair and Christian construction; that they ... never would menace the territorial integrity of China.&quot;

=== China&#x27;s envoy to U.S. and European nations ===
The success of this diplomacy was not lost on Qing dynasty court officials. On November 16, 1867, when he was set to retire and return to his political career at home, the Chinese government appointed Burlingame envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to head a Chinese diplomatic mission to the United States and the principal European nations. The mission, which included two Chinese ministers, an English and a French secretary, six students from Peking, and a considerable retinue, arrived in the United States in March 1868. Burlingame used his personal relations with the Republican administration to negotiate a relatively quick and favorable treaty. In a series of speeches across the country, he displayed eloquent oratory to advocate equal treatment of China and a welcoming stance toward Chinese immigrants.

On July 28, 1868, the mission concluded at Washington, D.C., a series of articles, supplementary to the Reed Treaty of 1858, and later known as the Burlingame Treaty. The treaty provided that Chinese subjects in the United States should enjoy the same rights as citizens of the most favored nation, a legal strategy which up until that point had only been used to expand foreign privileges in China. Burlingame worked successfully to include a clause permitting Chinese to become citizens, which was barred by American law. This treaty was the first equal treaty between China and a western power after the Opium War.

Subsequently, Burlingame also negotiated treaties with Denmark, Sweden, Holland, and Prussia. He died suddenly at Saint Petersburg on February 23, 1870, while negotiating terms for a treaty with Russia. He was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== Family ==
His son Edward L. Burlingame was founding editor of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. His grandson (Edward&#x27;s son), Roger Burlingame, was an author of fiction, nonfiction, and biographies.

== Legacy ==

After Burlingame&#x27;s death, the spirit and many of the specific provisions of the treaty bearing his name were reversed. Foreign powers continued to encroach upon China, and Congress passed strict laws against Chinese immigration. The success of the Communist Revolution of 1949 led to animosity between the two countries and Burlingame&#x27;s reputation was as a naive and euphoric advocate of China. After warming of relations in the 1980s, Burlingame&#x27;s reputation began to rise again, however.

Burlingame, California; Burlingame, Kansas; and Anson, Wisconsin, are all named after Anson Burlingame. The ranch which Burlingame purchased in San Mateo on the San Francisco Bay retained his name and was eventually developed after his death.

Anson Burlingame&#x27;s portrait, painted by Albion Harris Bicknell, hangs in historic Faneuil Hall, Boston. In 2018, upon the 150th anniversary of the Burlingame Treaty, a new bust of Anson Burlingame sculpted by Zhou Limin was unveiled at an international ceremony held at the Burlingame Public Library in Burlingame, California.

<doc id="266526" wikidata="Q1140158" url="?curid=266526" title="Endgame study">
<text>In the game of chess, an endgame study, or just study, is a composed position—that is, one that has been made up rather than played in an actual game—presented as a sort of puzzle, in which the aim of the solver is to find the essentially unique way for one side (usually White) to win or draw, as stipulated, against any moves the other side plays. If the study does not end in the end of the game, then the game&#x27;s eventual outcome should be obvious, and White can have a selection of many different moves. There is no limit to the number of moves which are allowed to achieve the win; this distinguishes studies from the genre of direct mate problems (e.g. &quot;mate in 2&quot;). Such problems also differ qualitatively from the very common genre of tactical puzzles based around the middlegame, often based on an actual game, where a decisive tactic must be found. 
==Composed studies==
Composed studies predate the modern form of chess. Shatranj studies exist in manuscripts from the 9th century, and the earliest treatises on modern chess by the likes of Luis Ramirez Lucena and Pedro Damiano (late 15th and early 16th century) also include studies. However, these studies often include superfluous pieces, added to make the position look more &quot;game-like&quot;, but which take no part in the actual solution (something that is never done in the modern study). Various names were given to these positions (Damiano, for example, called them &quot;subtleties&quot;); the first book which called them &quot;studies&quot; appears to be &quot;Chess Studies&quot;, an 1851 publication by Josef Kling and Bernhard Horwitz, which is sometimes also regarded as the starting point for the modern endgame study. The form is considered to have been raised to an art in the late 19th century, with A. A. Troitsky and Henri Rinck particularly important in this respect.

Most composers, including Troitsky, Rinck, and other famous figures such as Genrikh Kasparyan, are known primarily for their studies, being little known as players. However, some famous players have also composed endgame studies, with Emanuel Lasker, Richard Réti, Vasily Smyslov, and Jan Timman being perhaps the most notable ones.

==Examples==
Richard Réti&#x27;s study is one of the most famous of all time. It is White to play and draw. At first sight, this seems an impossible task: if White tries to chase after Black&#x27;s pawn he can never catch it (1.Kh7 h4 2.Kh6 h3 etc. is clearly hopeless), while it is clear that Black will simply take White&#x27;s pawn if he tries to promote it.

White can draw, however, by taking advantage of the fact that the king can move towards both pawns at once. The solution is 1. Kg7 h4 (1...Kb6 2. Kf6! h4 3.Ke5! transposes) 2. Kf6! Kb6 (if 2...h3, then 3.Ke6 h2 4.c7 Kb7 5.Kd7 allows white to promote his pawn) 3. Ke5! Now, if 3...Kxc6, then 4.Kf4 stops Black&#x27;s pawn after all, while if 3...h3 4.Kd6 allows White to promote his pawn. Either way, the result is a draw. (Also see King and pawn versus king endgame, the section Rule of the square.)

Not all studies are as simple as the above Réti example. This study (first diagram) is by Genrikh Kasparyan (first published in &quot;Magyar Sakkélet&quot;, 1962). White is to play and draw. The main line of the solution is 1. Ra1 a2 2. Ke6 Ba3 3. Bf4 Bb2 4. Be5 a3 5. Kd5 Bg6 6. Bd4 Bf7+ 7. Ke4 Bc4 8. Rg1, but there are various alternatives for both sides. For example, White could try 1.Bf4 on his first move, with the idea 1...Bxa2 2.Bxd6 and 3.Bxa3 is a draw, but Black can defeat this idea with 1...Bxf4 2.Rxa3 Bc2, which wins. To understand why one move works and another one does not, requires quite advanced chess knowledge. Indeed, it will not be obvious to many players that the position at the end of the given line (second diagram) is a draw at all.
One of the most notable studies is Leopold Mitrofanov&#x27;s 1967 first-prize winner. Unfortunately, Mitrofanov&#x27;s original study was subsequently found to have a , a miraculous defense that enabled Black either to obtain perpetual check or reach a drawn ending.

Solution: 1. b6+ Ka8 2. Re1! Nxe1 3. g7 h1=Q (if 3...Nc4+ then 4.Kb5 h1=Q 5.g8=Q+ Bb8 6.a7 Na3+ 7.Kc6 Qh2 8.axb8=Q+ Qxb8 9.b7+ Ka7 10.Qg1+ Ka6 11.Qb6 mate) 4. g8=Q+ Bb8 5. a7 Nc6+ 6. dxc6 Qxh5+ 7. Qg5 (not 7.Ka6 Qe2+ or 7.Kb4? Qh4+ with perpetual check) Qxg5+ 8. Ka6 (the queen is deflected from the white diagonal where she could give check) 8... Bxa7 (or 8...Qb5+ 9.Kxb5 Nc2 10.c7 and wins) 9. c7! (a silent move; the double threat c8=Q+ and b7 mate forces Black to sacrifice the queen) 9... Qa5+ 10. Kxa5 Kb7 11. bxa7 and White wins.
===Early example===

Most old shatranj studies are not valid in modern chess because of changed rules. However, the moves of the king, rook, and knight are unchanged. In this Arabic study White wins because the black knight is poorly placed. With White to move the best move is 1. Rd1, but it is not the only winning move. If Black is to move, 1... Kb8! 2. Kc6! Na5+! 3. Kb6! Nc4+ 4. Kb5! Ne5 5. Re1! Nd7 6. Kc6! wins.
==Studies and special moves==
The special moves or rules of chess, such as castling, underpromotion, double-square pawn advance, and &quot;en passant&quot; are commonly a key feature of studies, as are sacrifices.

===Castling===

Castling in the endgame occurs seldom and is more often seen in studies. Here is one example where White wins by privilege of castling rights.

: 1.0-0-0? Ra2! 2.d7 Ra1+ 3.Kc2 Rxd1 4.Kxd1 Kc7 drawn.

White needs: 1. d7! Kc7 2. d8=Q+! Kxd8 3. 0-0-0+ simultaneously attacking the king and rook that is captured next move.
== Study engineering ==
With the creation and popularization of chess-playing computer software programs, many of which have achieved Elo ratings significantly higher than top human players, many composers collaborate with them both in composing and solving compositions. Though proven to be helpful, positions have been found which cause even the strongest engines to incorrectly evaluate the outcome. Chess master Frédéric Lazard&#x27;s 1946 composition is White to play and draw.

Solution: 1. Ne4+ Kh4 (1...dxe4 2.Be1#) 2. Ng3! Qf8 (2...fxg3 3.Bb6!! and black cannot advance his pawns as the bishop will take them; if he recaptures it is stalemate. Check with the queen is met by Bg8 and stalemate.) 3. Be1 fxg3 4. Bf2! d4 (4...Qxf2 stalemate, 4...gxf2 5.g3+ Kh3 stalemate) 5. Bxd4 c5 6. Bxc5 Qf1+ 7. Bg1 Qf2 8. Bxf2 gxf2 9. g3+ Kxg3 drawn.

<doc id="266537" wikidata="Q1266839" url="?curid=266537" title="Durban International Airport">
<text>Durban International Airport (formerly [[Louis Botha]] Airport) was the international airport of Durban from 1951 until 2010, when it was replaced by King Shaka International Airport, to the north. The airport is co-located with AFB Durban.

==History==

The airport was opened in 1951, replacing the Stamford Hill Aerodrome. The original name of the airport was Louis Botha International, named after the South African statesman. The airport maintained this name until 1994 when the political changes that came with that year in South Africa resulted in a change of name to Durban International Airport. While the airport served the domestic market well, the airport suffered from low international passenger numbers and a runway that was too short for a fully laden Boeing 747 to take off. Due to the short runway and the hub and spoke policy that was adopted in the 1990s (favouring OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg), Durban lost almost all of its international traffic.

Plans to move the airport to La Mercy, approximately north of Durban International Airport, were proposed and shelved numerous times between the 1970s and 2007, before construction of what was to become King Shaka International Airport began in September 2007. Construction of the new airport was completed in 2010, with Durban International Airport handling its final flight on 30 April 2010 and all flights transferring to King Shaka International Airport in a single, overnight move.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 30 June 1962, a Douglas DC-4 (registration ZS-BMH) operating a scheduled South African Airways flight from Johannesburg to Durban collided with a South African Air Force Harvard trainer. The DC-4 made a successful emergency landing with 46 passengers and 5 crew; the Harvard trainer crashed with its crew of two parachuting to safety. The DC-4 was subsequently repaired.
* On 28 December 1973, a Douglas DC-3 (registration ZS-DAK) operated by Executive Funds lost both engines when turning onto final approach and ditched in the Indian Ocean. One passenger drowned out of the 22 passengers and 3 crew.
*On 26 November 1981, a hijacked Air India B707-300 (registration VT-DVB) was forced to land at the airport. The plane had been hijacked by mercenaries fleeing an abortive coup in the Seychelles. After freeing the 79 passengers and crew, the mercenaries surrendered.
* On 18 June 2008, a British Airways Boeing 737-200 registration ZS-OKD (operated by Comair), operating as Flight 6203 from Johannesburg, skidded off the runway while landing under adverse weather conditions. The aircraft was reported to have hit a wet patch on the tarmac, causing it to skid and resulting in the right landing-gear becoming embedded in the surrounding earth. The incident caused the closure of the airport for both arrivals and departures for several hours. All 87 passengers and six crew members escaped without serious injury.
* On 24 September 2009, South African Airlink Flight 8911 crashed in the suburb of Merebank shortly after takeoff from Durban International Airport, injuring its crew of three and one person on the ground, with the pilot subsequently dying of his injuries in hospital.

==Plans==
The airport was used by the South African Air Force and the Police Air Wing during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, before being decommissioned.

Although it is currently unclear as to what the future usage of the airport site will be, it is widely expected that the site will be used for future industrial development. The site is located on a large parcel of flat land in the Durban South Industrial Basin, which is already home to much of the city&#x27;s heavy industry; given Durban&#x27;s generally very hilly terrain, such a large, flat parcel is ideal for future industrial development, port expansion, or both. Ownership of the airport was transferred from the Airports Company South Africa to Transnet in 2012, for the construction of a dig-out port. In 2017, it was reported that plans for the dig-out port had been placed on hold until &quot;at least 2030&quot;.

No provision was made during the planning and construction of KSIA to accommodate the South African Air Force base at DIA, thus AFB Durban, 15 Squadron and related support units are still operating from this airport.

<doc id="266538" wikidata="Q1738681" url="?curid=266538" title="Ken Whyld">
<text>Kenneth Whyld (6 March 1926 – 11 July 2003) was a British chess author and researcher, best known as the co-author (with David Hooper) of &quot;The Oxford Companion to Chess&quot;, a single-volume chess reference work in English.

Whyld was a strong amateur chess player, taking part in the British Chess Championship in 1956 and winning the county championship of Nottinghamshire. He subsequently made his living in information technology while writing books on chess and researching its history.

As well as &quot;The Oxford Companion to Chess&quot;, Whyld was the author of other reference works such as &quot;Chess: The Records&quot; (1986), an adjunct to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; and the comprehensive &quot;The Collected Games of Emanuel Lasker&quot; (1998). He also researched more esoteric subjects, resulting in works such as &quot;Alekhine Nazi Articles&quot; (2002) on articles in favour of the Nazi Party supposedly written by world chess champion Alexander Alekhine, and the bibliographies &quot;Fake Automata in Chess&quot; (1994) and &quot;Chess Columns: A List&quot; (2002).

From 1978 until his death in 2003, Whyld wrote the &quot;Quotes and Queries&quot; column in the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot;.

A number of chess historians, including Dale Brandreth, Frank Skoff and Edward Winter, all of whom had close contact with Whyld, came to question his reliability and bona fides on certain issues.

Shortly after Whyld&#x27;s death, the Ken Whyld Association was established with the aim of compiling a comprehensive chess bibliography in database form and promoting chess history.

Whyld&#x27;s library was later sold to the Musée Suisse du Jeu, located on the shores of Lake Geneva in Switzerland (as reported in number 152 of &quot;EG&quot;).

<text>King Phalo Airport (; formerly East London Airport () until 23 February 2021) is an airport serving East London, a city in the Eastern Cape province on the southeast coast of South Africa.

The airport handles between 20 and 30 flights daily, which bring people to East London each year. Of these, about are holidaymakers, mostly local, and about 15% are foreign tourists. In 2013, the airport served 658,363 passengers. In 2016, King Phalo Airport was voted the fastest growing airport in South Africa, having accomplished an almost 19% increase in traffic over a 12-month-period. The airport welcomed over 806,000 passengers in 2016, beating the 679,000 that passed through East London in 2015. The second best performing airport for growth in 2014 was Kimberley, with its traffic growing by 11%. Overall the top airports of South Africa witnessed nearly 39.7 million passengers in 2016, up 5.3% on the year before.

== History ==
The airport had an inauspicious beginning in 1927, when Lieut Colonel Alistair Miller asked the East London town council to help establish a municipal aerodrome at Woodbrook, west of the city.

Passenger flights were undertaken by two de Havilland Moth planes on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sundays, weather permitting. Flights could also be booked for weekdays, but only by special arrangement. In 1931 it took 11 hours to fly from Windhoek in Namibia to King Phalo Airport.

In 1944 a new airport was built at Collondale, about 2 km west of the present terminal building.

In 1965 the airport was again moved, this time to its present site, 9 km west of the city centre. Construction of the terminal buildings finished in 1966, and the airport was named after Ben Schoeman, the minister of transport at the time.

The airport was renamed in 1994. Since then, major alterations to the terminal building have been completed and a new first-floor office development for the airport management team has been added.

<doc id="266542" wikidata="Q1250" url="?curid=266542" title="Friuli-Venezia Giulia">
<text>Friuli-Venezia Giulia () is one of the 20 regions of Italy and one of five autonomous regions with special statute. The regional capital is Trieste on the Gulf of Trieste, a bay of the Adriatic Sea.

Friuli-Venezia Giulia has an area of and about 1.2 million inhabitants. A natural opening to the sea for many central European countries, the region is traversed by the major transport routes between the east and west of Southern Europe. It encompasses the historical-geographical region of Friuli and a small portion of the historical region of —also known in English as the Julian March—each with its own distinct history, traditions and identity.

==Name==
&quot;Friuli&quot; comes from the Latin term (&#x27;Julius&#x27; forum&#x27;), a center for commerce in the Roman times, which today corresponds to the city of Cividale. The denomination &quot;Venezia Giulia&quot; (&#x27;Julian Venetia&#x27;, not referring to the city of Venice but to the Roman province of Venetia et Histria) was proposed by the Italian linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, with the intention of marking the Italian cultural spirit of the area.

==History==

In Roman times, modern Friuli-Venezia Giulia was located within Regio X Venetia et Histria of Roman Italy. The traces of its Roman origin are visible all over the area. In fact, the city of Aquileia, founded in 181 BC, served as the regional capital and rose to prominence in the Augustan era.

Following the Lombard settlements in the 6th century, the historical paths of Friuli and Venezia Giulia began to diverge. In 568, Cividale del Friuli (the Roman &quot;Forum Iulii&quot; (from which the name Friuli is derived)) became the capital of the first Lombard dukedom in Italy. In the 6th century, the Alpine Slavs, ancestors of present-day Slovenes, settled the eastern areas of the region. They settled in the easternmost mountainous areas of Friuli known as the Friulian Slavia, as well as in the Karst Plateau and in the area north and south of Gorizia. In the 12th and 13th centuries, they also moved closer to Trieste.

In 774 Charlemagne conquered Lombard Italy and absorbed it into Francia (the Frankish Empire from 800), with the Lombard Duke of Friuli replaced by a Frankish one. In 787 Charlemagne established a new patriarch at Aquileia. The duchy was dissolved in 828 and partitioned into smaller counties. In 843 the Empire was partitioned in the Treaty of Verdun placing Friuli at the frontier between Middle Francia (later the Kingdom of Italy) and East Francia (later the Kingdom of Germany) and in 846 the former duchy was reconstituted as the March of Friuli. In 961 Otto the Great of Germany took control of the Kingdom of Italy and established the Holy Roman Empire. In 1077, the Holy Roman Emperor recognized the territorial powers of the Patriarchate of Aquileia that temporarily extended its rule to areas to the east; however, by the 12th century the County of Gorizia had become independent. Trieste developed into the Imperial Free City of Trieste. The coastal territory between Gorizia and Trieste was controlled by the March of Carniola (Duchy of Carniola from 1364).
Friuli became Venetian territory in 1420; Trieste and Gorizia, which remained within the Holy Roman Empire, came under Habsburg (Austrian) dominance in 1382 and 1500 respectively. The Venetian fortress of Gradisca d&#x27;Isonzo was retaken by the Empire in 1511 and incorporated into Gorizia but Monfalcone to the south remained an effective Venetian exclave. Pordenone was a , under Austrian influence until 1515, when it fell to Venetian rule. Gradisca was separated from Gorizia in 1647 but were reunited in 1754 to form the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca.

With the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio, Venetian domination came to an end and Friuli was ceded to the Habsburg Monarchy (formally part of the Austrian Empire from 1804); however, Austria was forced to cede it to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in the 1805 Peace of Pressburg, along with the parts of the County of Gorizia and Gradisca west of the Isonzo (the boundary was formalized in the 1807 Treaty of Fontainebleau). Trieste and Gorizia were then also ceded to the Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces in the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn.

In 1815, following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna returned the area to Austria: Friuli was included in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, while Gorizia and Trieste were assigned to the Kingdom of Illyria (both crown lands of the Austrian Empire), with the boundary roughly following the former Imperial-Venetian border. In 1849 Illyria was abolished and Gorizia and Trieste both became part of the Austrian Littoral crown land, along with Istria and several islands in the Kvarner Gulf.

Under the enlightened government and policies set by the Austrian Empire and continued by the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries, Trieste flourished, reaching an extraordinary economic development as the main harbor of the Habsburg empire. The Third Italian War of Independence led to the annexation of Lombardy-Venetia, including Friuli, to the Kingdom of Italy, while the Littoral remained in Austrian hands.

During the First World War, the region was a prominent theatre for military operations and suffered serious damage and loss of lives. After the war, the former Littoral was annexed by Italy in the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo, although Venezia Giulia&#x27;s borders were the subject of an international dispute.

The Second World War led to the creation of the Anglo-American Administration in Trieste until the border was defined in the 1954 Memorandum of London. After Trieste was reassigned to Italy, the Autonomous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia was finally established.

The region&#x27;s name was Friuli-Venezia Giulia (hyphenated) until 2001, when the official spelling &quot;Friuli Venezia Giulia&quot; (without hyphen) was adopted following the modification of Article No.116 of the Italian Constitution. The term &quot;Venezia Giulia&quot; was coined by Graziadio Isaia Ascoli.

==Geography==

Friuli-Venezia Giulia is Italy&#x27;s north-easternmost region. It covers an area of 7,858 km2 and is the fifth smallest region of the country. It borders Austria to the north and Slovenia to the east, the three countries meeting at the tripoint on the mountain of Dreiländereck, known as Monte Forno in Italian. To the south, it faces the Adriatic Sea and to the west the Veneto region.

The region spans a wide variety of climates and landscapes from the mild Oceanic in the south to Alpine continental in the north. The total area is subdivided into 42.5% mountainous-alpine terrain in the north, 19.3% is hilly, mostly to the southeast, while the remaining 38.2% comprises the central and coastal plains.
Morphologically the region can be subdivided into four main areas. The mountainous area in the north: this part of the region includes Carnia and the ending section of the Alps (Carnic Alps and Julian Alps), of which the highest peaks exceed 2,700 m above sea level (Jôf di Montasio 2,754 m). Its landscapes are characterised by vast pine forests and pastures, mountain lakes (e.g. Sauris, Fusine, and Barcis), and numerous streams and small rivers descending from the mountains. 

The area is also known for its tourist destinations, especially during the winter season (Monte Zoncolan, Tarvisio, Sella Nevea, Forni di Sopra and Piancavallo). The hilly area is situated to the south of the mountains and along the central section of the border with Slovenia. The main product of agriculture in this area is wine, whose quality, especially the white, is known worldwide. The easternmost part of the hilly area is also known as Slavia Friulana, as it is mostly inhabited by ethnic Slovenes. 

The central plains are characterized by poor, arid, and permeable soil. The soil has been made fertile with an extensive irrigation system and through the adoption of modern intensive farming techniques. In this part of the region, most of the agricultural activities are concentrated. The coastal area can be further subdivided into two, western-eastern, subsections separated by the River Isonzo&#x27;s estuary. 

To the west, the coast is shallow and sandy, with numerous tourist resorts and the lagoons of Grado and Marano Lagunare. To the east, the coastline rises into cliffs, where the Karst Plateau meets the Adriatic, all the way to Trieste and Muggia on the border with Slovenia. The Carso has geological features and phenomena such as hollows, cave networks, and underground rivers, which extend inland in the provinces of Trieste and Gorizia, with an altitude ranging between 300m and 600m.
The rivers of the region flow from the North and from Slovenia into the Adriatic. The two main rivers are the Tagliamento, which flows west–east in its upper part in the Carnic Alps and then bends into a north–south flow that separates the Julian Alps from Alpine foothills and the Isonzo (Slovenian: Soča) which flows from Slovenia into Italy. The Timavo is an underground river that flows for 38  km from Slovenia and resurfaces near its mouth north-west of Duino.

The region Friuli-Venezia Giulia has a temperate climate. However, due to the terrain&#x27;s diversity, it varies considerably from one area to another. Walled by the Alps on its northern flank, the region is exposed to air masses from the East and the West. The region receives also the southerly Sirocco from the Adriatic Sea, which brings in heavy rainfall. Along the coast, the climate is mild and pleasant. 

Trieste records the smallest temperature differences between winter and summer and between day and night. The climate is Alpine-continental in the mountainous areas, where, in some locations, the coldest winter temperatures in Italy can often be found. The Kras plateau has its own weather and climate, influenced, mostly during autumn and winter, by masses of cold air coming from the northeast. These generate a very special feature of the local climate: the north-easterly wind Bora, which descends onto the Gulf of Trieste with gusts occasionally exceeding speeds of 150  km/h.

==Economy==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 38 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.2% of Italy&#x27;s economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 31,200 euros or 103% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 106% of the EU average.
The economy of Friuli-Venezia Giulia is one of Italy&#x27;s most successful. Its core is based on small and middle-size enterprises (the so-called &quot;North-East model&quot;), on specialized farming and on high-quality tourism with a significant inclination towards exports.

Agriculture and farming maintain an essential role in the economy of the region and employed in 2001 around 95,000 persons. Its products are exported not only within the country and Europe (fruit and vegetables, cheese) but have become known worldwide for their acclaimed quality (cured ham and wines, especially white ones). Noteworthy is also the production of soy (third producer in Italy with more than 37,000 hectares cultivated in 2000) and timber production in Carnia.

The economy of the region is based on a widespread mosaic of small and medium-sized enterprises; of particular importance are the four industrial districts where a multitude of highly specialised enterprises are concentrated. These districts are centred around the towns of Manzano, San Daniele del Friuli (cured ham), Maniago (knives), and Brugnera (furniture). Several large enterprises are also present in the region in both the industry and services sectors. Some of these companies are world leaders in their relevant sectors; such are Fincantieri (headquarters in Trieste with shipyards in Monfalcone) for the construction of the world&#x27;s largest cruise ships, Zanussi-Electrolux (Pordenone) in the production of electrical appliances, Danieli, Eurotech, Illy, Rizzani de Eccher, Solari di Udine, TBS Group, Banca Generali, Genertellife, Italia Marittima, Telit, Wärtsilä, Allianz Italia and Assicurazioni Generali in Trieste, a leading insurance company in the world.
In the services sector, the city of Trieste plays a leading role (with knock-on effects on the other provincial capitals); it is here that activities such as the regional government, large banking, and insurance companies are concentrated. 

The unemployment rate stood at 5.7% in 2020. 

===Transport===
With its commercial Free Port, Trieste also plays an essential role in the trade sector: special custom regulations ensure exclusive financial conditions to operators. The Port of Trieste is today the most important centre worldwide for the trade of coffee and plays a strategic key role in trade with northern and eastern Europe.
Although small in size, Friuli-Venezia Giulia has always been &#x27;in the centre of Europe&#x27; and has played an important role in connecting Italy (and the Mediterranean) to Central and Eastern Europe. Its role will become even more strategic as a logistical platform with the imminent enlargement of the European Union. Hence the importance of the infrastructure network of the region, which can today be considered first-rate in quality and diversity. The motorway network consists of more than 200 km that runs from North to South and from West to East, connecting the region to Austria and Slovenia.

The railway network consists of around 500 km of track, with the two twin-line &#x27;backbones&#x27; Venice-Trieste and Trieste-Udine-Tarvisio-Austria. The motorway and railway networks are linked to the ports of Trieste, Monfalcone, and Porto Nogaro, the three most northerly ports of the Mediterranean. Trieste, in particular, has a free port for goods since 1719. It is the Italian port with the greatest capacity for covered storage, with a surface area of more than 2 million square meters and 70 km of rail tracks. Intermodality is guaranteed by the Cervignano terminal, in operation since 1988, to serve the increasing commercial traffic between Italy and Eastern European countries.

The regional airport of Ronchi dei Legionari is situated 30 km from Trieste and 40 km from Udine and is closely connected to the motorway and railway networks. The airport offers regular national and international flights including destinations in Eastern Europe. The region is now placing much of its hopes for future economic development in the construction of a high-speed European Transport Corridor n° V connecting Lyon, Turin, Venice, Trieste, Ljubljana, Budapest, and Kyiv, so as to improve the traffic of goods and services with new EU partners.

===Tourism===
Friuli-Venezia Giulia has many small and picturesque villages, 13 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.

==Demographics==

Population density is lower than the national average: In 1978 there were in total only 1,224,611 inhabitants; in 2008 it was 157.5 inhabitants per km2 (compared to 198.8 for Italy as a whole). However, density varies from a minimum of 106 inhabitants per km2 in the province of Udine to a maximum of 1,144 inhabitants per km2 in the province of Trieste.

The negative natural balance in the region is partly made up by the positive net migration. To some extent the migratory surplus has in fact offset the downward trend in the population since 1975. In 2008, the resident population with foreign nationality registered in the region accounted to 83,306 persons (6.7% of the total population).

==Government and politics==


A special Italian statute of 31 January 1963 effective 16 February 1963 constituted Friuli-Venezia Giulia as an autonomous region within the Italian Republic.

The President of Regional Government is the region&#x27;s head of government. Executive power is exercised by the and legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council. In the latest regional election, which took place on 4 March 2018, Massimiliano Fedriga of the was elected president by a landslide.

===Administrative divisions===
Like most of the rest of Italy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia was previously divided into four provinces: Gorizia, Pordenone, Trieste and Udine. They were abolished on 30 September 2017, with the first three immediately ceasing activity, while the province of Udine remained active until 22 April 2018. In 2019, they were all reactivated as &quot;regional decentralization entities&quot; (, or EDR) beginning on 1 July 2020.

In anticipation of this 2017 and 2018 abolition of the provinces in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the Regional Council created a system of 18 Intermunicipal Territorial Unions (, or UTI). The UTIs progressively took on the local services that the municipalities previously managed, extending across the larger area managed by each UTI, while also taking on some responsibilities previously managed by the provinces; this handling of &quot;wide area local development policies&quot; by the UTIs was conceived as a way allow more focused planning and budgeting for the 215 , divided across the 18 UTIs, than would be possible on a region-wide basis by the Regional Council. However, activity of UTIs was discontinued after the reactivation of former provinces.

The Regional Council also passed a statute which allows, should it desire at some future point, for the establishment of the regional capital of Trieste—with smaller surrounding towns—as a metropolitan city administering wide area local development policies.

====Intermunicipal Territorial Unions (UTI)====


====Regional decentralization entities====
Until 2017–18, Friuli-Venezia Giulia was divided into four provinces. The Regional Council voted to abolish them effective 30 September 2017, although the provincial council of the largest, Udine, carried on some administrative responsibilities until 22 April 2018. They have again been active since 1 July 2020 under the administrative form of regional decentralization entities or EDRs.
==Culture==
===Language===

The official languages of the region are Italian, Friulian, Slovene and German.

Italian is the official national language. Friulian language is also spoken in most of the region—with a few exceptions, most notably Trieste and the area around Monfalcone and Grado, where a version of the Venetian language and Triestine dialect is spoken instead.

Venetian is also spoken in western part of the Province of Pordenone, and in the city of Pordenone itself, due to its proximity with the Veneto region. Friulian and Venetian are more common in the countryside, while standard Italian is the predominant language in the larger towns (Udine, Pordenone, Gorizia). The region is also home to Italy&#x27;s Slovene-speaking minority.

===Historical flag===
A very popular symbol among the Friulian community (mostly identified with the Friulian-speaking population in the provinces of Udine, Pordenone and Gorizia and the numerous expat communities around the world) is the Friulian Historical Flag, to which the official regional flag is roughly inspired, being somehow a modern interpretation of it. The official, modern &quot;Friuli-Venezia Giulia&quot; flag logo was issued in 1967–1968 (and adopted in 2001) to represent the region which in 1963 took the administrative setup of today. The historical symbol of the eagle dates back to (at least) the 13th century, the time of the Patriarchate of Aquileia.

<text>The Westerkerk (; ) is a Reformed church within Dutch Protestant Calvinism in central Amsterdam, Netherlands. It lies in the most western part of the Grachtengordel neighborhood (Centrum borough), next to the Jordaan, between the Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht.

==History==
The Westerkerk was built between 1620 and 1631 in Renaissance style according to designs by architect Hendrick de Keyser. He is buried in the church he designed earlier: the Zuiderkerk. The building of the Westerkerk was finished and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser and inaugurated on June 8, 1631. The church has a length of and a width of . The high nave is flanked by the two lower aisles. The three-aisled basilica has a rectangular plan with two transepts of equal dimensions. As a result, the plan for this church was given the form of two Greek crosses connected with each other (a patriarchal cross).

Several older churches in Amsterdam, such as the Oude Kerk and Nieuwe Kerk, were originally built before the Reformation and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation in 1578. The Westerkerk was one of the first purpose-built Protestant churches. The Noorderkerk and Zuiderkerk preceded the Westerkerk. Today the Westerkerk remains the largest church in the Netherlands that was built for Protestants, and is still in use by the PKN (Protestantse Kerk in Nederland)

==Main Duyschot organ==
There was no organ when the Westerkerk was consecrated on Pentecost Sunday, June 8, 1631, in accordance with Calvinistic belief at that time instrumental music in the church was considered profane. It took many years of deliberation until an organ was finally allowed. At first there was still talk of moving the small organ (koororgel) used in the Nieuwe Kerk or the Oude Kerk, but the pipes of the Oude Kerk choir organ were finally moved to the Zuiderkerk. In 1681 the Westerkerk decided to commission the organ builder Roelof Barentszn Duyschot for the construction of a new organ. Roelof Barentszn Duyschot died before the organ was completed. His son finished the commission in 1686. Later, in 1727, the console was enlarged with a third manuel by Christiaan Vater, who learned his profession through Arp Schnitger.

Many alterations were done on the organ in the course of time. In the 19th century in 1895 a rebuild of the inside of the organ took place by Daniel Gerard Steenkuyl. Many of the old pipes and the wind chests were re-used. In 1939, the keyboard was equipped with electric tracker action and a swell work was added. It was not what this organ was intended to be in sound and action. The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.

So between 1989 and 1992 the organ was reconstructed by Flentrop organ builders in Zaandam to its former mechanical action, again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the bovenwerk (Oberwerk, located in the top of the organ case) is still almost complete, with stops by Vater. An exception is the baarpyp, which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the Dulciaan which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. The situation after 1992 was that less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the hoofdwerk (great organ) and the Rugwerk (choir organ). The manuals and stop triggers beside this mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this rugwerk. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing. For complex organ works one or even two stop assistants are necessary for triggering the stops. During the restoration of the inside of the church between 2018 and 2020, the inside of the organ was taken to Zaandam at Flentrop Orgelbouw for cleaning and partly revoicing the sound. In the spring of 2020 it was returned to the church. On 18 April the new organist Evan Bogerd performed the commissioning concert on the internet; the church was closed to visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic.

From April till the end of October, there is a free weekly lunchtime concert on Fridays or Saturdays at 1pm. In August there are free concerts almost every day for a week &#x27;Geen dag zonder Bach&#x27; (&#x27;Not a day without Bach&#x27;) and the Grachten (Canal) festival. A voluntary donation is asked at the end of the concert upon leaving the church. Music by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) is performed almost weekly at the services of divine worship on Sundays.

The organist titulaire in the Westerkerk is Evan Bogerd.
== Stoplist of the Duyschot organ ==

Couplers and shutters:
* Shutters for all manuals and pedals.
* Couplers: I/II, II/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P 
* Td = Treble is doubled

== The paintings of the organ ==

The inside of the organ shutters of the hoofdwerk was painted by Gerard de Lairesse. On the left panel we see the dancing and playing King David in front of the Ark of the Covenant. On the right panel we see the Queen of Sheba presenting gifts to King Solomon. Both stories in the book of Kings in the old testament of the Bible. Gerard de Lairesse was born in Liège in French Belgium in 1640 and he moved to Amsterdam in 1664. In the second half of the 17th century, he was one of the most popular painters in the Netherlands. At this moment, the shutters of the Duyschot organ can be seen on a retrospective of the work of Gerard de Lairesse at the National Museum Twente in Enschede. The outside paintings of these panels or shutters were lost in the 19th century when the church wanted to sell them. The grisailles on the rugwerk panels were also painted by Gerard de Lairesse; The four evangelists with their items are shown. The inside of the rugwerk shutters have paintings of old musical instruments. The complete organ was cleaned and re-painted in 1992 in its original state of colour in 1686; most of it in marble imitation.

== Ds. A.H. Visser organ ==
The small organ on the east side of the church was built in 1963 by D.A. Flentrop from Zaandam. It was tuned and slightly altered in 2001. In that year it was named after the minister Ds. H.A Visser who was the man begging for money to buy the organ in 1963. He succeeded. The organ has 12 stops over 2 manuals and pedal. Since 1963 the organ case was in not painted but plain oak wood. After the renovation it was painted in a light green color. In 2017 the organ was cleaned by Flentrop Zaandam. During the church interior restoration it was packed against the dust.

== The tower with the spire ==

The tower, called the Westertoren (&#x27;western tower&#x27;), is the highest church tower in Amsterdam, at 87 meters (286 feet). It is not known who the designer of the spire was. Hendrick de Keyser designed an octagonal spire for the tower which was never built. It is suggested Jacob van Campen was the designer. The crown topping the spire is the Imperial Crown of Austria of Maximilian I. In 2006 the crown on top was painted in its original blue color.

== Bells in the Westertoren ==
Just above the clock-faces is the carillon. The largest 14 of the 51 bells in this carillon were cast by François Hemony in 1658. The modern bells were cast in 1959 by Eijsbouts replacing bells which had been damaged by atmospheric pollution. In 1991 three bells more were added by the same foundery. The smaller Hemony bells, which are not currently In use, can be seen in the tower together with the original baton keyboard from the 17th century. The carillon was enlarged to four octaves and is tuned in meantone temperament. It is the only carillon in the city chiming the entire twenty-four hours (At the request of the residents of the Jordaan District). The drum to do this, was made by Jurriaen Spraeckel from Zutphen in 1659 and it still chimes every quarter of the hour to announce the hour and half hour strike. On the quarter of the hour a short tune is performed. The two strike bells were made by Assuerus (Ahasverus) Koster in 1636. The hour strike bell (F0) is the largest in Amsterdam (7509 kg) and is hung in the room for the carillon. The text on this Bourdon bell is: &quot;VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM - ASSUERUS KOSTER ME FECIT AMSTELDAMI 1636&quot; The smaller bell (A1) for half hour is hung in top of the spire just under the crown. Weekly on Tuesday at noon the city carillonneur gives his recital on the carillon for an hour. He is also responsible for the tunes on the drum and changes these twice a year. At this moment (2024) Boudewijn Zwart is the city carillonneur. A major restoration of the tower started in 2023 and will be completed in 2024. The bells also had to go to the foundry to allow for an improved design in the windows of the tower, as the bells have hung for centuries with hammers that hang on the outside. The second city carillonneur Gideon Bodden is the advisor for this work on the carillon. No changes are made to the bells. See above for the names and years

In a lower chamber behind the sounding boards in the tower wall there are three swinging bells also made by François Hemony in 1658. The largest swinging bell was replaced after 27 years by Claude Fremy (his pupil, nephew and successor), because it was cracked. The bells (a major triad) are rung to announce the divine service on Sunday and also when the service is on, during praying the &#x27;Our Father&#x27;. This bell by Fremy is also connected with the pedals in the baton keyboard of the carillon.

== Rembrandt ==
Rembrandt van Rijn was buried somewhere under a tombstone in the Westerkerk on October 8, 1669. The exact location of the grave is unknown; the number of his grave was lost. It was in a numbered kerkgraf (grave owned by the church). There is a memorial marker on the north wall, made in 1909 after a model on the &quot;Nachtwacht&quot;. After twenty years, his remains were taken away and destroyed. That was customary with the remains of poor people at that time. Rembrandt was buried as a poor man. Every year on his birthday anniversary, the 15th of July, he is remembered in the Westerkerk with a lunchtime concert with music from the time of Rembrandt&#x27;s life, and flowers are hung on his memorial marker.

Rembrandt&#x27;s lover Hendrickje Stoffels was also buried here, as was Rembrandt&#x27;s son Titus van Rijn. Other painters buried in the Westerkerk are Nicolaes Berchem, Gillis d&#x27;Hondecoeter, Melchior d&#x27;Hondecoeter and Govert Flinck.

== Dutch royal family ==
On March 10, 1966, Princess Beatrix married Prince Claus von Amsberg in the Westerkerk. The Nieuwe Kerk on Dam Square where royal weddings are usually held was being renovated at the time.

== Anne Frank ==
The Westerkerk is located close to the Anne Frank House where diarist Anne Frank, her family and others were hid in the Achterhuis from Nazi persecution for two years during World War II. The Westertoren is mentioned frequently in her diary – its clock-face on the tower could be seen from the attic of the Achterhuis, and Anne Frank described the chiming of the carillon as a source of comfort. A memorial statue of Anne Frank is located outside the church at Westermarkt.

<text>The Citroën DS () is a front mid-engined, front-wheel drive executive car manufactured and marketed by Citroën from 1955 to 1975, in fastback/sedan, wagon/estate, and convertible body configurations, across three series of one generation.

Marketed with a less expensive variant, the Citroën ID, the DS was known for its aerodynamic, futuristic body design; unorthodox, quirky, and innovative technology, and set new standards in ride quality, handling, and braking, thanks to both being the first mass production car equipped with hydropneumatic suspension, as well as disc brakes. The 1967 series 3 also introduced &quot;directional headlights&quot; to a mass-produced car.

Italian sculptor and industrial designer Flaminio Bertoni and the French aeronautical engineer André Lefèbvre styled and engineered the car, and Paul Magès developed the hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension. Robert Opron designed the 1967 Series 3 facelift. Citroën built 1,455,746 examples in six countries, of which 1,330,755 were manufactured at Citroën&#x27;s main Paris Quai de Javel (now Quai André-Citroën) production plant.

In combination with Citroën&#x27;s proven front-wheel drive, the DS was used competitively in rally racing during almost its entire 20year production run, and achieved multiple major victories, as early as 1959, and as late as 1974. It placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century poll recognizing the world&#x27;s most influential auto designs and was named the most beautiful car of all time by &quot;Classic &amp; Sports Car&quot; magazine.

The name DS and ID are puns in the French language. &quot;DS&quot; is pronounced exactly like , , whereas &quot;ID&quot; is pronounced as &quot;idée&quot; (&#x27;idea&#x27;).

==Model history==
After 18 years of secret development as the successor to the Traction Avant, the DS 19 was introduced on 6 October 1955, at the Paris Motor Show. In the first 15 minutes of the show, 743 orders were taken, and orders for the first day totalled 12,000. During the 10 days of the show, the DS took in 80,000 deposits; a record that stood for over 60 years, until it was eclipsed by the Tesla Model 3 which received 180,000 first day deposits in March 2016. The original list price for a 1959 ID19 was US$2,833 ($ in dollars).

Contemporary journalists said the DS pushed the envelope in the ride vs. handling compromise possible in a motor vehicle.

To a France still deep in reconstruction after the devastation of World War II, and also building its identity in the post-colonial world, the DS was a symbol of French ingenuity. The DS was distributed to many territories throughout the world.

It also posited the nation&#x27;s relevance in the Space Age, during the global race for technology of the Cold War. Structuralist philosopher Roland Barthes, in an essay about the car, said that it looked as if it had &quot;fallen from the sky&quot;. An American advertisement summarised this selling point: &quot;It takes a special person to drive a special car&quot;.

Because they were owned by the technologically aggressive tyre manufacturer Michelin, Citroën had designed their cars around the technologically superior radial tyre since 1948, and the DS was no exception.

The car used double wishbone suspension with L-shaped arms at the front and trailing-arms at the rear, with totally novel hydropneumatic spring and damper units. The car&#x27;s advanced hydraulics included automatic self-levelling and driver adjustable ride-height, developed in-house by Paul Magès. This suspension allowed the DS to travel quickly on the poor road surfaces then common in France.

In addition, the vehicle had power steering and a semi-automatic transmission (the transmission required no clutch pedal but gears still had to be shifted by hand, with the shift lever controlling a powered hydraulic shift mechanism in place of a mechanical linkage). 
It had a fibreglass roof which lowered the centre of gravity, and so reduced weight transfer. Inboard front disc brakes (as well as independent suspension) reduced unsprung weight. Different front and rear track widths reduced the unequal tyre loading, which is well known to promote understeer, typical of front-engined and front-wheel drive cars. Although disc brakes had been tried on a car as early as 1902 by British Lanchester, volume production had not been applied until 1949, by USA small car manufacturer Crosley, but without success. The Citroën DS was the first successful fielding of disc brakes on a mass-produced car.

Furthermore, at launch the DS featured innovative centerlock wheels which used a captive allen bolt as the central fastener whilst a hexagonal protrusion transferred the drive to a matching recess in the wheel. This made it possible to change the wheel very quickly in the event of a puncture and proved an advantage in motor racing.

As with all French cars, the DS design was affected by the tax horsepower system, which effectively encouraged smaller engines. Unlike the &quot;Traction Avant&quot; predecessor, there was no top-of-range model with a powerful six-cylinder engine. Citroën had planned an air-cooled flat-6 engine for the car, but did not have the funds to put the prototype engine into production.

The DS placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition, and fifth on the 2005 list of &quot;100 Coolest Cars&quot; by &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot;. It was also named the most beautiful car of all time by &quot;Classic &amp; Sports Car&quot; magazine after a poll of 20 world-renowned car designers, including Giorgetto Giugiaro, Ian Callum, Roy Axe, Paul Bracq, and Leonardo Fioravanti.

==Motorsport==
The DS was successful in motorsports like rallying, where sustained speeds on poor surfaces are paramount, and won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1959. In the 1000 Lakes Rally, Pauli Toivonen drove a DS19 to victory in 1962.

In 1966, the DS won the Monte Carlo Rally again, with some controversy as the competitive BMC Mini-Cooper team was disqualified due to rule infractions. Ironically, Mini was involved with DS competition again two years later, when a drunk driver in a Mini in Sydney Australia crashed into the DS that was leading the 1968 London–Sydney Marathon, from the finish line. Robert Neyret won the Rallye du Maroc in 1969 and 1970 in a DS 21.

The DS was still competitive in the grueling 1974 London-Sahara-Munich World Cup Rally, where it won over 70 other cars, only 5 of which even completed the entire event.

==Technical innovation – hydraulic systems==

In conventional cars, hydraulics are only used in brakes and power steering. In the DS they were also used for the suspension, clutch, and transmission. The cheaper 1957 ID19 did have manual steering and a simplified power braking system. An engine-driven pump pressurizes the closed system to 

At a time when few passenger vehicles had independent suspension on all wheels, the application of the hydraulic system to the car&#x27;s suspension system to provide a self-levelling system was an innovative move. This suspension allowed the car to achieve sharp handling combined with very high ride quality, frequently compared to a &quot;magic carpet&quot;.

The hydropneumatic suspension used was pioneered the year before, on the rear of another car from Citroën, the top of range Traction Avant 15CV-H.

==Effect on Citroën brand development==

The 1955 DS cemented the Citroën brand name as an automotive innovator, building on the success of the Traction Avant, which had been the world&#x27;s first mass-produced unitary body front-wheel-drive car in 1934. In fact, the DS caused such a huge sensation that Citroën was apprehensive that future models would not be of the same bold standard. No clean sheet new models were introduced from 1955 to 1970.

The DS was a large, expensive executive car and a downward brand extension was attempted, but without result. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Citroën developed many new vehicles for the very large, profitable market segments between the 2CV and the DS, occupied by vehicles like the Peugeot 403, Renault 16 and Ford Cortina, but none made it into production. Either they had uneconomic build costs, or were ordinary &quot;me too&quot; cars, not up to the company&#x27;s high standard of innovation. As Citroën was owned by Michelin from 1934 to 1974 as a sort of research laboratory, such broad experimentation was possible. Michelin was getting a powerful advertisement for the capabilities of the radial tyre Michelin had invented, when such experimentation was successful.

New models based on the small, utilitarian 2CV economy car were introduced, such as the 1961 Ami. It was also designed by Flaminio Bertoni and aimed to combine Three-box styling with the chassis of the 2CV. The Ami was very successful in France, but less so on export markets. Many found the styling controversial, and the car noisy and underpowered. The Dyane was a modernised 2CV with a hatchback that competed with the 2CV inspired Renault 4 Hatchback. All these 2 cylinder models were very small, so there remained a wide market gap to the DS range all through the 1960s.

In 1970, Citroën finally introduced a car to target the mid-range – the Citroën GS, which won the &quot;European car of the Year&quot; for 1971 and sold 2.5 million units. It combined a small flat-4 air-cooled engine with Hydropneumatic suspension. The intended Wankel rotary-engined version with more power did not reach full production.

==Replacing the DS==

The DS maintained sales and remained competitive throughout its production run. Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted gearstick, and separate fenders began to seem a little old-fashioned in the 1970s.

Citroën invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the SM, which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width. The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit. The front disc brakes were the same design. Axles, wheel bearings, steering knuckles, and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.

The SM had a different purpose than replacing the 15-year-old DS design, however – it was meant to launch Citroën into a completely new luxury grand touring market segment. Only fitted with a costly, exotic Maserati engine, the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS. The SM was not designed to be a practical 4-door saloon suitable as a large family car, the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe. Typically, manufacturers would introduce low-volume coupés based on parts shared with an existing saloon, not as unique models, a contemporary example being the Mercedes-Benz SLC (C107). BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid-size sedan (5 series), large coupe (6 series), and large sedan (7 series) sharing common underpinnings.

The SM&#x27;s high price and limited utility of the 2+2 seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS. While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars, a &#x27;modern DS&#x27; and the smaller CX, it was left to the CX alone to provide Citroën&#x27;s large family or executive car in the model range.

The last DS came off the production line on 24 April 1975 – with Citroën building up approximately eight months of inventory of the &#x27;break&#x27;/&#x27;Safari&#x27; (estate/station wagon) version of the DS, to continue sales until the autumn of 1975 when the estate/station wagon version of the CX would be introduced.

==Development==
The DS maintained its size and shape, with easily removable, unstressed body panels, but design changes occurred. During the 20-year production, improvements were made on an ongoing basis.

===ID 19 submodel to extend brand downwards (1957–69)===
The 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the Citroën Traction Avant. This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II, so a cheaper submodel, the Citroën ID, was introduced in 1957. 

The ID shared the DS&#x27;s body but was less powerful and luxurious. Although it shared the engine capacity of the DS engine (at this stage 1,911 cc), the ID provided a maximum power output of only compared to the claimed for the DS19. Power outputs were further differentiated in 1961 when the DS19 acquired a Weber-32 twin bodied carburettor, and the increasing availability of higher octane fuel enabled the manufacturer to increase the compression ratio from 7.5:1 to 8.5:1. A new DS19 now came with a promised . The ID19 was also more traditional mechanically: it had no power steering and had conventional transmission and clutch instead of the DS&#x27;s hydraulically controlled set-up. Initially, the basic ID19 was sold on the French market with a price saving of more than 25% against the DS, although the differential was reduced at the end of 1961 when the manufacturer withdrew the entry-level ID19 &quot;Normale&quot;. A station wagon variant, the &quot;ID Break&quot;, was introduced in 1958.

===D Spécial and D Super (1970–75)===
The ID was replaced by the D Spécial and D Super in 1970, but these retained the lower specification position in the range. The D Super was available with the DS21 2175 cc engine and a 5-speed gearbox, and named the &quot;D Super 5.&quot;

===Series 2 – Nose redesign in 1962===
In September 1962, the DS was restyled with a more aerodynamically efficient nose, better ventilation, and other improvements. It retained the open two headlamp appearance, but was available with an optional set of driving lights mounted on the front fenders. All models in the range changed nose design at the same time, including the ID and station wagon models.

===Series 3 – Nose redesign in 1967 with directional headlights===
In late 1967, for the 1968 model year, the DS and ID was again restyled, by Robert Opron, who also styled the 1970 SM and 1974 CX. This version had a more streamlined headlamp design. This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy and the inner set swivelled with the steering wheel. This allowed the driver to see &quot;around&quot; turns, especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night. The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable.

Behind each glass cover lens, the inboard high-beam headlamp swivels by up to 80° as the driver steers, throwing the beam along the driver&#x27;s intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road. The outboard low-beam headlamps are self-leveling in response to pitching caused by acceleration and braking.

Because this feature was not allowed in the US (see World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations), a version with four exposed headlights that did not swivel was manufactured for the US market.

Although a directional headlight was previously seen on the 1948 Tucker 48 &#x27;Torpedo&#x27;, Citroën was the first to mass-market adaptive headlights.

===New &quot;green&quot; hydraulic fluid===
The original hydropneumatic system used a vegetable oil (&quot;liquide hydraulique végétal&quot;, LHV), but later switched to a synthetic (&quot;liquide hydraulique synthétique&quot;, LHS). Both had the disadvantage of being hygroscopic. Disuse allows water to enter the hydraulic components, causing deterioration and requiring expensive maintenance. The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid. With every &quot;inhalation&quot; of fresh moisture- (and dust-) laden air, the fluid absorbed more water.

For the 1967 model year, Citroën introduced a new mineral oil-based fluid LHM (&quot;liquide hydraulique minéral&quot;). This fluid was much less harsh on the system.

LHM required completely different materials for the seals. Using either fluid in the incorrect system would completely destroy the hydraulic seals very quickly. To help avoid this problem, Citroën added a bright green dye to the LHM fluid and also painted all hydraulic elements bright green. The earlier LHS parts were painted black.

All models, including the station wagon and ID, were upgraded at the same time. The hydraulic fluid changed to the technically superior LHM in all markets except the US and Canada, where the change did not take place until January 1969 due to local regulations.

==International sales and production==

The DS was primarily manufactured at the Quai André-Citroën in the Javel neighborhood of Paris, with other manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom, South Africa, the former Yugoslavia (mostly Break Ambulances), and Australia.

Australia constructed their own D variant in the 1960s at Heidelberg, Victoria, identified as the ID 19 &quot;Parisienne.&quot; Australian market cars were fitted with options as standard equipment such as the &quot;DSpecial DeLuxe&quot; that were not available on domestic European models.

Until 1965 UK cars were assembled at the manufacturer&#x27;s Slough premises, to the west of London, using a combination of French-made knock down kits and locally sourced components, some of them machined on site. A French electrical system superseded the British one on the Slough cars in 1962, giving rise to a switch to &quot;continental style&quot; negative earthing. An intermediate model between the DS and the ID, called the &quot;DW&quot;, was introduced on the UK market in 1963 with a manual transmission and simpler foot-operated clutch while retaining the DS power unit, power steering and power braking; outside of the UK this model was known as the &quot;DS19M&quot;. When the 1985 cc engine replaced the original 1911 cc unit in September 1965 the manual-equipped DSes built in Slough were renamed &quot;DS19A&quot;. The Slough factory closed on 18 February 1966 and thereafter cars for the British market were imported fully assembled from the company&#x27;s French plant. The British-built cars are distinguished by their leather seats, wooden (early ID19 models) or one-piece plastic (early DS19 models) dashboards, chromed number plate mount set into the front bumper, and (on pre-1962 cars) Lucas-made electrics. These were all right hand drive cars.

The DS was built and sold in South Africa from 1959 to 1975.

The DS was sold in Japan, but the models were built in France and left hand drive.

==DS in North America==
The DS was sold in North America from 1956 to 1972. Despite its popularity in Europe and regard for its design from the American motoring press, it did not sell well in the United States, and little better in Canada. While promoted as a luxury car, it did not have the basic features that American buyers expected to find on such a vehicle, such as an automatic transmission, air conditioning, power windows, or a powerful engine. The DS was designed specifically to address the French market, with punitive tax horsepower taxation of large engines and very poor roads, and not for a market where those constraints were removed.

Further harming the DS&#x27; prospects on the other side of the Atlantic was an inadequate supply of parts for the vehicle. Jay Leno described the sporadic supply of spare parts as a problem for 1970s era customers, based on his early experiences working at a Citroën dealer in Boston.
Additionally, the DS was expensive, with a vehicle costing $4,170 in 1969, when $4,500 would buy a Buick Electra 225 Custom. The Electra was available with an automatic transmission, power windows, and came with a much larger engine (a 7,040 cc V8), and it was hardly the only competitor to the DS to have these features as options or as standard.

As a result of the insufficient supply of replacement parts, an inability to compete with bigger and more luxurious cars sold for the same price, and simply having not been designed for the North American market, sales for the DS were mediocre on the North American market, ultimately reaching a total of 38,000.

US regulations at the time also banned one of the car&#x27;s more advanced features: its composite headlamps with aerodynamic covered lenses. Based on legislation that dated from 1940, all automobiles sold in the U.S. were required to have round, sealed-beam headlamps that produced 75,000 candlepower or (73575 candela) maximum. The DS&#x27;s quartz iodine swiveling headlamps designed for the 1968 model were not allowed by the regulations. Even the aerodynamic headlight covers, featured on other cars such as the Jaguar E-Type were illegal and had to be removed. It was not until Ford Motor Company lobbied to have composite headlamps allowed that the sealed-beam headlamp requirements were finally rescinded in 1983.

However, the European lamps were legal in Canada, including the directional headlamps.

The hydraulic fluid change in 1967 also fell afoul of American regulations. NHTSA follows the &quot;precautionary principle,&quot; also used by the Food and Drug Administration, where new innovations are prohibited until their developers can prove them safe to the regulators. The castor-based LHV and synthetic LHS fluids used in European-market DSes were not certified for use in North America, so cars sold there used conventional brake fluid instead. Brake fluid (as well as LHV and LHS) is hygroscopic and miscible, readily absorbing and mixing with moisture, the idea being that within a closed hydraulic circuit these properties will ensure pockets of non-soluble water will not form and cause corrosion of the system from within. The design of the DS&#x27;s hydraulic system used much more fluid and allowed much more moist air into the system than a simple hydraulic braking circuit, so the fluid&#x27;s hygroscopic properties were not preventing corrosion as intended. Brake fluid also did not provide the viscosity and lubricity suited for used in the suspension, clutch and gear change mechanism. Mineral-based LHM fluid was designed to remedy these issues but Citroen was obligated to demonstrate the new fluid was safe for automotive use before it could be installed in American-market cars. It took NHTSA until January 1969 to approve it, so in the US market about half the production of cars in the 1969 model year use the older red LHS fluid and half use newer green LHM fluid, neither of which is compatible with the other.

==Design variations==

===Pallas===
In 1965 a luxury upgrade, the DS Pallas (after Greek goddess Pallas Athena), was introduced. This included comfort features such as better noise insulation, a more luxurious (and optional leather) upholstery, and external trim embellishments. From 1966, the Pallas model received a driver&#x27;s seat with height adjustment.

===Station wagon, Familiale, and ambulance===
A station wagon version was introduced in 1958. It was known by different names in individual markets (Break in France, Safari, and Estate in the UK, Wagon in the US, and Citroën Australia used the terms Safari and Station-Wagon). It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack. &#x27;Familiales&#x27; had a rear seat mounted further back in the cabin, with three folding seats between the front and rear squabs. The standard Break had two side-facing seats in the main load area at the back.

The Ambulance configuration was similar to that of the Break, but with a 60/30 split in the rear folding seat to accommodate a stretcher. A &#x27;Commerciale&#x27; version was also available for a time.

The Safari saw use as a camera car, notably by the BBC. The hydropneumatic suspension produces an unusually steady platform for filming while driving.

===Convertible===
A factory convertible was offered from summer 1960 until summer 1971. The Décapotable Cabriolet d&#x27;Usine (factory convertible) were built by French carrossier Henri Chapron, for the Citroën dealer network. It was an expensive car and only 1,365 were sold. These DS convertibles used a special frame which was reinforced on the side members and rear suspension swingarm bearing box, similar to, but not identical to the Break (Station Wagon) frame.

The design of the factory convertible was by Flaminio Bertoni, who had originally started sketching convertibles in 1954. The production version was developed together with Chapron. The manufacture was passed to Henri Chapron, who had already been converting small numbers of DS&#x27;s to convertibles in his Paris plant since 1958. Chapron persevered with his own custom versions alongside the works cars, for those who wanted something particular or to allow conversion of an existing sedan. After official production ended in August 1971, Chapron kept building small numbers of the works design for individual customers until 1977.

===Chapron variations===
In addition, Chapron also produced a few coupés, non-works convertibles and special sedans (including the &quot;Prestige&quot;, same wheelbase but with a central divider, and the &quot;Lorraine&quot; notchback). Chapron also built the imposing DS Présidentielle in 1967-1968 to a design created by Citroën&#x27;s design department. This car was long, specifically to be longer than the cars used by US Presidents Johnson and Nixon. Ordered directly by President Charles de Gaulle, he did not like the car due to its divider and continued to mainly use either DS landaulets or the two earlier special-bodied Citroën 15/6 H built by Franay and Chapron.

===Bossaert coupé===
Between 1959 and 1964, Hector Bossaert produced a coupé on a DS chassis shortened by . While the front end remained unchanged, the rear end featured notchback styling.

===The Reactor===
In 1965, American auto customizer Gene Winfield created &quot;The Reactor&quot;, a Citroën DS chassis, with a turbocharged flat-six engine from the Corvair driving the front wheels. Since the DS already had the engine behind the front wheels, the longer engine meant only one row of seats. This was draped in a streamlined, low slung, aluminum body.

&quot;The Reactor&quot; was seen in American television programs of the era, such as &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; (episode 54, &quot;Bread and Circuses&quot;), &quot;Batman&quot; episodes 110 (&quot;Funny Feline Felonies&quot;) and 111 (driven by Catwoman Eartha Kitt), and &quot;Bewitched&quot;, which devoted its episode 3.19 (&quot;Super Car&quot;) to The Reactor.

=== Michelin PLR ===
The Michelin PLR is a mobile tyre evaluation machine, based on the DS Break, built in 1972, later used for promotion.

===&quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; taxi===
For the 1989 film &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, the producers created a flying car to depict a typical taxi in the future world of 2015. This taxi was based on the DS.

==Technical details==

===Suspension===
In a hydropneumatic suspension system, each wheel is connected, not to a metal spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a &quot;height corrector&quot;, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher-riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, &quot;oleopneumatic&quot; (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. &quot;Hydropneumatic&quot; (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.)

The DS neither had nor needed a jack to raise the car off the ground. Instead, the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand. To change wheel in the event of a flat tyre, one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting, insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre, then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting. The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above the ground, ready to be changed. This system, used on the SM also, was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that, after the suspension was raised to the high position, lifted the tyre clear of the ground. The DS system, while impressive to use, sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly, especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel.

===Source and reserve of pressure===
The central part of the hydraulic system was the high-pressure pump, which maintained a pressure of between in two &quot;accumulators&quot;. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front brakes, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail.

Two different hydraulic pumps were used. The DS used a seven-cylinder axial piston pump driven off two belts and delivering of pressure. The ID19, with its simpler hydraulic system, had a single-cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the camshaft.

===Gearbox and clutch===
====&quot;Hydraulique&quot; or &quot;Citromatic&quot;====
The DS was initially offered only with the &quot;Hydraulique&quot; four-speed semi-automatic (B.V.H.—&quot;Boîte de Vitesses Hydraulique&quot;) gearbox.

This was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, operated by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch, disengaged the previous gear, then engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled automatically, responding to hydraulic sensing of engine rpm and the position of the butterfly valve in the carburetor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop-in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following a loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill.

Unlike an automatic transmission, there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked. In addition, the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped, so the car could not be left in gear when parked. The only way to prevent the car from rolling (for example, if parked on a slope) is to use the parking brake.

==== Manual—four-speed and five-speed ====
The later and simpler ID19 had the same gearbox and clutch, manually operated. This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in 1963. The mechanical aspects of the gearbox and clutch were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID 19. In September 1970, Citroën introduced a five-speed manual gearbox, in addition to the original four-speed unit. All manual transmissions used a steering column-mounted shifter.

==== Fully-automatic ====
In September 1971 Citroën introduced a 3-speed fully-automatic Borg-Warner 35 transmission gearbox, on the &quot;DS 21&quot; and later &quot;DS 23&quot; models. The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time. Many automatic DSs, fuel-injected DS 23 sedans with air conditioning, were sold in Australia.

===Engines===

The DS was originally designed around an air-cooled flat-six based on the design of the 2-cylinder engine of the 2CV, similar to the motor in the Porsche 911. Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped.

Thus, for such a modern car, the engine of the original DS 19 was old-fashioned. It was derived from the engine of the 11CV Traction Avant (models 11B and 11C). It was an OHV four-cylinder engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of and a stroke of , giving a volumetric displacement of 1911 cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated at 3800 rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated at 4500 rpm.

Like the Traction Avant, the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine, with the differential in between. Thus some consider the DS to be a mid engine front-wheel drive car.

The DS and ID engines evolved throughout their 20-year production run. The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four-cylinder engine. The initial 1911 cc three main bearing engine (carried forward from the Traction Avant) of the DS 19 was replaced in 1965 with the 1985 cc five-bearing wet-cylinder motor, becoming the DS 19a (called DS 20 from September 1969).

The DS 21 was also introduced for model year 1965. This was a 2175 cc, five main bearing engine; power was 106 hp DIN This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of Bosch electronic fuel injection for 1970, making the DS one of the first mass-market cars to use electronic fuel injection. Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time, owing to the employment of larger inlet valves.

Lastly, 1973 saw the introduction of the 2347 cc engine of the DS 23 in both carbureted and fuel-injected forms. The DS 23 with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model, producing SAE (130 hp DIN).

IDs and their variants went through a similar evolution, generally lagging the DS by about one year. ID saloon models never received the DS 23 engine or fuel injection, although the Break/Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS 23 engine when it was introduced, supplemented the DS20 Break/Familiale.

The top of the range ID model, The DSuper5 (DP) gained the DS21 engine (the only model that this engine was retained in) for the 1973 model year and it was mated to a five-speed gearbox. This should not be confused with the 1985 cc DSuper fitted with an optional &quot;low ratio&quot; five-speed gearbox, or with the previous DS21M (DJ) five-speed.

==In popular culture==
President Charles de Gaulle survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit-Clamart near Paris on 22 August 1962, planned by Algerian War veteran Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry. The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns, disable the vehicles, and then close in for the kill. De Gaulle praised the unusual abilities of his unarmoured Citroën DS with saving his life – the car, riddled with bullets and with two tyres punctured, was still able to escape at full speed. Afterward, De Gaulle vowed never to ride in any other make of car. This event was recreated in the film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973).

The 1961 Citroën DS 19 Décapotable Usine by Henri Chapron garnered publicity for the new model, from its prominent film placement, when Cary Grant himself &quot;telephoned the French automotive company, Citroën, to order a new car for use in the film &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; (1962).&quot;

The car the eponymous villain uses in the 1965 French comedy &quot;Fantômas se déchaîne&quot; is a modified, flying Citroën DS.

In the American 90s television series, &quot;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&quot;, Rupert Giles (Buffy&#x27;s Watcher) owns and drives a 1963 model of the DS.

==Legacy==

Citroën DS values have been rising – a 1973 DS 23 Injection Electronique &quot;Decapotable&quot; (Chapron Convertible) sold for €176,250 (US$209,738) at Christie&#x27;s Rétromobile in February 2006. A similar car sold by Bonhams in February 2009 brought €343,497 (US$440,436). On 18 September 2009 a 1966 DS21 Decapotable Usine was sold by Bonhams for a hammer price of GB£131,300. Bonhams sold another DS21 Decapotable (1973) on 23 January 2010 for €189,000.

Citroën was the featured exhibit at the Mullin Automotive Museum for the year 2017/8, and the DS made its first appearance on the lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance in 2018.

The DS&#x27;s place in French society was demonstrated in Paris on 9 October 2005 with a celebration of the 50th anniversary of its launch. 1,600 DS cars drove in procession past the Arc de Triomphe.

In 2009, Groupe PSA created a new brand – DS Automobiles, intended as high quality, high specification variations on existing models, with differing mechanics and bodywork. This brand was introduced in three models, the DS 3, DS 4, and the DS 5. The DS 3, launched in March 2010, is based on Citroën&#x27;s new C3, but is more customisable and unique, bearing some resemblance to the original DS, with its &quot;Shark Fin&quot; side pillar.

<text>Centericq is a text mode menu- and window-driven instant messaging interface that supports the ICQ, Yahoo!, AIM, MSN, IRC, XMPP, LiveJournal, and Gadu-Gadu protocols.

== Overview ==
Centericq allows you to send, receive, and forward messages, URLs, SMSes (both through the ICQ server and email gateways supported by Mirabilis), contacts, and email express messages, and it has many other useful features. Known to work in Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, Windows and macOS/Darwin Operating Systems.

Its heyday was in the first half-decade of the 2000s, with reviews appearing in Softpedia, Czech online magazines &quot;ABC Linux&quot; and &quot;Linux.cz&quot;. It was recommended in a 2004 OSNews article on console applications, and in a similar article in the Russian magazine Computerra. Two tutorial articles appeared in the German magazine LinuxUser in 2001 and 2004; the latter article appeared in the English version of Linux Magazine. It was included in a 2002 round-up of ICQ clients in the Russian XAKEP magazine, and in a 2005 round-up review of IRC Clients in Free Software Magazine. The FSM reviewer noted Centericq for its windows-like interface built on top of the usual curses library, which provides much information, but can look cluttered on smaller terminal windows, including the standard 80 by 25 terminal. It found that IRC support was &quot;excellent&quot; due to support for multiple servers and channels and the ease of switching between them in the “windowed” interface. In September 2002, Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols found it &quot;the greatest of all console IM clients&quot; due to its &quot;excellent interface and a huge number of features and configuration options&quot; in a category review on Freshmeat. In 2005 it was reviewed in The Unofficial Apple Weblog; despite support for .mac accounts, the reviewer noted &quot;annoying key combos&quot; required to access the menus, because on Mac OS X the usual function key assignments of Centericq could not be used. Though he could not access the MSN network, he concluded: &quot;All things considered, I&#x27;ve decided that Centericq is the most stable and intuitive terminal based chat client.&quot;

In August 2007, the project&#x27;s (then) website stated that Centericq development was &quot;dead&quot;, and that the website would be shut down in November 2007. The site referred users to the &quot;CenterIM&quot; fork of the project. The developers of the CenterIM fork applied several security patches and updates. , CenterIM was still in development, with version 4.22.9 released on December 14. Neither CenterICQ nor CenterIM 4 support Unicode, but support for UTF-8 is planned for CenterIM 5.

<text>George Airport () is an airport located in George, Western Cape, South Africa. It was formerly known as [[P. W. Botha]] Airport, named after the state president who lived in this part of the country.

This airport was originally built in 1977 as an exact replica of the Keetmanshoop Airport in Namibia, but since its expansion and renovation, it now looks completely different. George Airport has won the award for Africa&#x27;s best airport in the category under two million passengers per year six times; the last time was in 2017. The award is given by Airports Council International (ACI).

In 2013, the airport served 560,432 passengers, substantially more than the 154,000 in 2003. From 2014 onwards, continued increase in passenger numbers were witnessed, with 2017 seeing a record number of passengers (785,486), closing in on the design capacity of the airport which should necessitate further terminal expansion in the near future.

* 7 December 2009 – An Embraer ERJ 135 (&quot;registration:ZS-SJW&quot;) operated by Airlink on a scheduled flight (&quot;SA-8625&quot;) overran the runway in wet conditions and ended up on a public road. There were no fatalities, but the plane suffered substantial damage. The accident was caused by an incorrect sealant used on the runway, and the airline was cleared of all blame. Airlink&#x27;s insurers took legal action against the state-owned Airports Company of South Africa.

<text>The Hiller Aviation Museum is an aviation museum located at the San Carlos Airport in San Carlos, California focused on Northern California aviation history, Hiller Aircraft and helicopter history.

==History==
===Background===
As early as the late 1960s, Stanley Hiller began collecting aircraft at a warehouse in Redwood City, California. By 1986, it displayed 15 aircraft and set a goal of a acquiring a total of 28 of Hiller&#x27;s designs. Eight years later it had surpassed this and the Hiller Museum of Northern California Aviation Heritage included over 40 aircraft.

===Move to San Carlos===
However, public access was limited. So, funded by a trust established by Hiller, the museum announced a proposal to acquire a building at the San Carlos Airport and expand it to facility. A lease for the property was approved in March 1996 and ground was broken in October. The Hiller Aviation Museum opened on 5 June 1998.

The Boeing 2707 mockup, which had been on display at the museum since it opened, moved back to Seattle in 2013 where it is undergoing restoration at the Museum of Flight.

== Facilities ==
The Michael King Smith Research Library at the museum has a collection of approximately 5,400 books.

== Exhibits ==
Exhibits at the museum include flight simulators, a retired British Airways 747 to explore, and an indoor drone plex. There are also displays about early aviation, California pioneers, air racing, women in aviation, the mechanics of flight, urban air mobility and weather.

<text>San Carlos Airport is a public airfield located northeast of San Carlos, California, in San Mateo County and serves the San Francisco Bay Area.

The airport lies off U.S. Route 101. The airport is home to Civil Air Patrol West Bay Composite Squadron 192. Next to the airport lies the Hiller Aviation Museum.

== History ==
The San Carlos Flying Field was established during World War I by J. Paulding Edwards on a field north of Cordilleras Creek and east of today&#x27;s Old County Road. A hangar was situated along the western end of Terminal Way. San Carlos&#x27; first pilot&#x27;s license was issued on July 10, 1917 to Lieutenant Prince.

In 1923, the airfield was taken over by the Cooley family. Charles P. Cooley was the primary flight instructor and his father, Frank S. Cooley, operated the field. On July 12, 1940, a fire destroyed the main hangar and twelve aircraft. Operations were maintained on an airstrip bounded by today&#x27;s Brittan Avenue, Washington Street, Old County Road, and Industrial Road.

Sometime around 1935 the Cooley family established a different airfield near the foot of today&#x27;s Twin Dolphin Drive in San Carlos. That facility had a runway and a building that housed various industrial activities. The Cooley family eventually determined that the airport needed to be moved because its proximity to the Phelps and Steinberger Sloughs limited the length of the runway.

The Cooleys opened another airfield at the present location of the San Carlos airport in 1948. In 1952, ownership was transferred to Francis Michaud, who renamed it San Carlos-Belmont Airport. Repair and administrative buildings were added, and plans were developed to lengthen the runway to . In 1957, the field was renamed San Mateo County Airport, Inc. Ownership was split between Michaud, the Piombo Construction Company, and six other parties. San Mateo County purchased the property in 1964. Today the airport is completely funded with user and business fees and receives no money from the County&#x27;s General Fund.

In 1999, a proposal was given to extend the runway by into the marshy area near Bair Island south of the airport. The proposal encountered opposition among the adjacent residents in Redwood Shores and Foster City, who complained about the potential for increased noise. Opponents felt a longer runway would lead to bigger and noisier planes, in particular, more corporate aircraft of the light jet category. As a result, the runway was not extended. 

In 2017, residents complained of excessive noise at the airport caused by flights operated by Surf Air (now operated by Southern Airways Express). They formed a group named Calm The Skies. San Mateo County acknowledged the noise issue caused by Surf Air. Part of the County solution was to introduce an arrival procedure called &quot;Bayside Visual Approach&quot; that underwent testing in 2016 which shifts flights and noise from San Mateo County to the city of Sunnyvale in neighboring Santa Clara County. A curfew has also been discussed in addition to other measures to mitigate the noise.

On January 30, 2025, the County of San Mateo Airports announced that the San Carlos Airport in would enter an ATC Zero state on February 1, 2025, meaning the airport’s Federal Contract Tower would be unstaffed. The Federal Aviation Administration had awarded a new contract for air traffic services at San Carlos Airport to Robinson Aviation, but the contract did not include locality pay adjustments for the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a result, all current air traffic controllers declined employment offers, leading to a loss of air traffic control services. The ATC Zero state was narrowly averted after negotiations led to an acceptable employment contract.

==Facilities==
San Carlos Airport covers at an elevation of 5 feet (2 m). Its one runway, 12/30, is with an asphalt surface. Aircraft with gross weight in excess of are prohibited.

San Carlos Airport is home to over 30 aviation-related businesses. Facilities and FBOs at KSQL include Bay Aerial Helicopter Service, FlyBayArea, JATO Aviation, Rabbit Aviation Services, Surf Air, Zanette Aviation Insurance, West Valley Flying Club, Diamond Aviation Charter, and the San Carlos Flight Center.

The Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) has a chapter at San Carlos Airport. EAA Chapter 20 had about 50 members as of 2010. An on-field flight school typically hosts monthly meetings on the second Saturday of each month. 

In the year ending May 31, 2020, the airport had 75,243 aircraft operations, average 206 per day: 84% general aviation, 16% air taxi and &lt;1% military. 323 aircraft were then based at this airport: 287 single-engine, 23 multi-engine, four jets and nine helicopters.

== Origin of SQL airport code ==

Some have speculated that the airport code of SQL is a humorous reference to the nearby headquarters of Oracle Corporation, a maker of database software. In databases, SQL, or Structured Query Language, is used for handling structured data. However, the airport had the code SQL years before Oracle&#x27;s predecessor, Software Development Laboratories, was incorporated in June 1977, as it is listed in the Airman&#x27;s Information Manual published by the Federal Aviation Administration in 1972.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On September 2, 2010, a Beechcraft Queen Air crashed into a nearby lagoon at Oracle headquarters shortly after takeoff from runway 30, killing all three occupants.
* On October 20, 2017, a Cirrus SR-22 overran the end of runway 30, crashing through a fence and onto adjacent Skyway Road upon takeoff. The two occupants suffered only minor injuries.

<doc id="266569" wikidata="Q2544946" url="?curid=266569" title="Walter Jenkins">
<text>Walter Wilson Jenkins (March 23, 1918 – November 23, 1985) was an American political figure and longtime top aide to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Jenkins&#x27; career ended after he was arrested and charged with &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; with another man in a public restroom in Washington, D.C. The incident happened weeks before the 1964 presidential election, in an era in which homosexual behavior was widely condemned.

==Personal life==
Jenkins was born in Jolly, Texas, and spent his childhood in Wichita Falls, Texas. There he attended Midwestern State University and then spent two years at the University of Texas, though he did not earn a degree. In 1945, following his discharge from the Army, he converted to Roman Catholicism and married Helen Marjorie Whitehill.

Jenkins and his wife had six children, four boys and two girls. They separated in the early 1970s but never divorced.

==Government career==
Jenkins began working for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1939 when Johnson was serving in the U.S. House of Representatives as the member from Texas&#x27;s 10th congressional district. For most of the next 25 years, Jenkins served as Johnson&#x27;s top administrative assistant, following Johnson as he rose to become a Senator, Vice President under John F. Kennedy, and President.

From 1941 until 1945, Jenkins served in the United States Army during World War II. In 1951, he returned to Wichita Falls to run for the House of Representatives. Jenkins lost to Frank N. Ikard in a race marked by attacks on Jenkins because of his Roman Catholic faith.

Johnson&#x27;s former aides credit Jenkins for his ability and temperament. In 1975, journalist Bill Moyers, a former Johnson aide and press secretary, wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot;: &quot;When they come to canonize political aides, [Jenkins] will be the first summoned, for no man ever negotiated the shark-infested waters of the Potomac with more decency or charity or came out on the other side with his integrity less shaken. If Lyndon Johnson owed everything to one human being other than Lady Bird, he owed it to Walter Jenkins.&quot; Joseph Califano wrote, &quot;Jenkins was the nicest White House aide I ever met in any administration. He was never overbearing. It was quite remarkable.&quot;

By the 1960s, Jenkins was more Johnson&#x27;s friend than employee, close to Lady Bird Johnson and involved in their family finances as well. The Johnsons celebrated Lady Bird&#x27;s fifty-first birthday at a party at Jenkins&#x27; home in December 1963.

==Scandal and resignation==

===Arrest===
A month before the 1964 presidential election, on October 7, District of Columbia Police arrested Jenkins in a YMCA restroom. He and another man were booked on a disorderly conduct charge, an incident described as &quot;perhaps the most famous tearoom arrest in America.&quot; He paid a $50 fine. Rumors of the incident circulated for several days, and Republican Party operatives helped to promote it to the press. Some newspapers, including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, refused to run the story. Journalists quickly learned that Jenkins had been arrested on a similar charge in 1959, which made it much harder to explain away as the result of overwork or, as one journalist wrote, &quot;combat fatigue.&quot;

Finally, on October 14, a &quot;Washington Star&quot; editor called the White House for Jenkins&#x27; comment on a story it was preparing. Jenkins turned to White House lawyers Abe Fortas, the President&#x27;s personal lawyer, and Clark Clifford, who unofficially was filling the role of White House Counsel. They immediately lobbied the editors of Washington&#x27;s three newspapers not to run the story, which only confirmed its significance. Within hours, Clifford detailed the evidence to the President and press secretary George Reedy, who while &quot;openly weeping,&quot; confirmed the story to reporters. Probably forewarned, Johnson told Fortas that Jenkins needed to resign.

Anticipating the charge that Jenkins might have been blackmailed, Johnson immediately ordered an FBI investigation. He knew that J. Edgar Hoover would have to clear the administration of any security problem because the FBI itself would otherwise be at fault for failing to investigate Jenkins properly years before. Hoover reported on October 22 that security had not been compromised. Johnson later said: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t have been more shocked about Walter Jenkins if I&#x27;d heard that Lady Bird had tried to kill the Pope.&quot; He also fed conspiracy theories that Jenkins had been framed. He claimed that before his arrest Jenkins had attended a cocktail party where the waiters came from the Republican National Committee, though the party was hosted by &quot;Newsweek&quot; to celebrate the opening of its new offices. The &quot;Star&quot; printed the story and UPI transmitted its version on October 14. Jenkins resigned the same day. Johnson immediately ordered a poll to determine the public&#x27;s reaction to the affair and learned the next day that its effect on the voters was negligible.

Johnson announced that only he would contact the press about the incident, but his wife, Lady Bird Johnson, issued her own statement of support for Jenkins.

===Political reactions===
The incident embarrassed the administration but had little impact on the campaign in which Johnson led his opponent by large margins. One columnist wrote on October 15, &quot;Walter Jenkins has revived and dramatized all the harsh feelings about morals, and political cliques, and the Texas gang in Washington.&quot; Yet the incident disappeared so quickly from the political scene that Theodore H. White, surveying the 1964 election campaign, assessed its impact this way: &quot;Perhaps the most amazing of all events of the campaign of 1964 is that the nation faced the fact fully—and shrugged its shoulders.&quot; Jenkins&#x27; arrest was quickly overshadowed by international affairs: Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was deposed on October 14, the British electorate voted Labour into power on October 15, and China successfully tested a nuclear weapon on October 16.

Johnson&#x27;s Republican opponent in the 1964 presidential election, Barry Goldwater, knew Jenkins from the Senate and from serving as commanding officer of his Air Force Reserve unit, but initially denied knowing him. He did not comment on the incident while campaigning. Although it fit well with the charges he had been making about the lack of morality in Johnson&#x27;s administration, those referred to Bobby Baker and Billie Sol Estes. Instead, since FBI agents had just questioned him about Jenkins, he publicly asked Hoover to explain why Jenkins had not undergone a rigorous security check before joining the White House staff.

Goldwater&#x27;s campaign offices distributed bumper stickers and buttons bearing slogans such as, &quot;LBJLIGHT BULB JENKINS: NO WONDER HE TURNED THE LIGHTS OUT&quot; and &quot;ALL THE WAY WITH LBJ, BUT DON&#x27;T GO NEAR THE YMCA&quot;. During the remainder of the campaign Goldwater occasionally alluded to the scandal. In speeches, he referred to Johnson&#x27;s &quot;curious crew who would run the country&quot; to the knowing amusement of his audience. At the time, observers noted the difference between the way Goldwater alluded to the scandal and the way the Republican National Committee and Goldwater&#x27;s running mate, William E. Miller, used it to exploit &quot;popular fears.&quot; Goldwater later said he chose not to make the incident a campaign issue. &quot;It was a sad time for Jenkins&#x27; wife and children, and I was not about to add to their private sorrow,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography. &quot;Winning isn&#x27;t everything. Some things, like loyalty to friends or lasting principle, are more important.&quot;

Johnson mentioned the affair in general terms while campaigning. In Pittsburgh, on October 27, he told a crowd that in government &quot;unfortunate things&quot; happen and people &quot;disappoint&quot; you. Some &quot;make mistakes&quot; and need to resign and there need to be impartial investigations.

Members of Congress called for an FBI investigation of the case, citing concerns that the FBI had been unaware of Jenkins&#x27; previous offense in the same Washington men&#x27;s room in January 1959.

===Supportive reactions===
On October 15, James Reston gave some support to Johnson by confirming that &quot;President Eisenhower was embarrassed by a comparable morals charge against one of his first appointees of his first Administration.&quot; On October 19, Drew Pearson in his &quot;Washington Merry-go-round&quot; column recounted the 1959 events with greater detail and named Arthur H. Vandenberg, Jr. as the Eisenhower appointee who &quot;had homosexuality problems and could not pass a security test.&quot; Campaigning in San Diego on October 28, Johnson replied to a reporter&#x27;s question about &quot;sex deviates&quot; in his administration that every administration had its scandals and mentioned that Eisenhower had faced a similar problem with his appointments secretary, thus confirming Pearson&#x27;s outing of Vandenberg, whose departure from the Eisenhower administration had been blamed on his health.

On October 29, 1964, leading clergymen, including Francis B. Sayre, Jr. of Washington National Cathedral, United Presbyterian Church Leader Eugene Carson Blake, Methodist Bishop John Wesley Lord, American Hebrew Congregations President Maurice Eisendrauth, and theologians Paul Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr, issued a letter commenting on the Jenkins affair: &quot;We see the Jenkins episode as a case of human weakness. If there is a security factor involved, let that be dealt with on its own terms and let it not serve chiefly as an excuse for dwelling on this one episode to cater to the prurient curiosity or to the self-righteousness of part of the public.&quot;

After the election, the American Mental Health Foundation wrote a letter to Johnson protesting about the &quot;hysteria&quot; surrounding the case:

On November 17, Lady Bird visited Walter Jenkins and his wife Marjorie, who were preparing to move home to Texas. She reported in her diary that he had received &quot;a barrage of mail&quot; from acquaintances and the public that &quot;seems so understanding.&quot; Washington columnist Joseph Alsop, like Jenkins a closeted homosexual, wrote publicly in support of Jenkins and sent him a letter of support as well.

===Effect on Johnson administration===
Johnson appointed Bill Moyers to succeed Walter Jenkins.

Johnson&#x27;s White House Press Secretary George Reedy told an interviewer: &quot;A great deal of the president&#x27;s difficulties can be traced to the fact that Walter had to leave. ... All of history might have been different if it hadn&#x27;t been for that episode.&quot; Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark said that Jenkins&#x27; resignation &quot;deprived the president of the single most effective and trusted aide that he had. The results would be enormous when the president came into his hard times. Walter&#x27;s counsel on Vietnam might have been extremely helpful.&quot;

==Later years and legacy==
Jenkins resigned from the Air Force Reserve in February 1965.

After leaving Washington, Jenkins returned to Texas and lived the rest of his life in Austin, where he worked as a Certified Public Accountant and management consultant and ran a construction company. He died in 1985, at the age of 67, a few months after suffering a stroke.

A made-for-television film, &quot;Vanished&quot;, loosely based on the Jenkins resignation, aired in 1971.

The Tony-award winning play, &quot;All the Way&quot;, and its television adaptation, about Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s first year in office from the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 1963 until the 1964 election on November 3, both depict the 1964 scandal involving Jenkins. In the film adaptation, Jenkins is portrayed by Todd Weeks.

Canadian playwright Steven Elliott Jackson wrote a play that stages an imaginary meeting and one-night-stand between Jenkins and civil rights activist Bayard Rustin called &quot;The Seat Next to the King&quot;. Directed by Tanisha Taitt and starring Conor Ling as Jenkins (along with Kwaku Okyere as Rustin), the play won the award for Best New Play at the 2017 Toronto Fringe Festival.

<text>A concentration camp is a prison or other facility used for the internment of political prisoners or politically targeted demographics, such as members of national or minority ethnic groups, on the grounds of state security, or for exploitation or punishment. Prominent examples of historic concentration camps include the British confinement of non-combatants during the Second Boer War, the mass internment of Japanese-Americans by the US during the Second World War, the Nazi concentration camps (which later morphed into extermination camps), and the Soviet labour camps or gulag.

==History==
===Definition===
The term &quot;concentration camp&quot; originates from the Spanish–Cuban Ten Years&#x27; War when Spanish forces detained Cuban civilians in camps in order to more easily combat guerrilla forces. Over the following decades the British during the Second Boer War and the Americans during the Philippine–American War also used concentration camps.

The term &quot;concentration camp&quot; and &quot;internment camp&quot; are used to refer to a variety of systems that greatly differ in their severity, mortality rate, and architecture; their defining characteristic is that inmates are held outside the rule of law. Extermination camps or death camps, whose primary purpose is killing, are also imprecisely referred to as &quot;concentration camps&quot;.


The &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot; defines the term &quot;concentration camp&quot; as: &quot;A camp where persons are confined, usually without hearings and typically under harsh conditions, often as a result of their membership in a group which the government has identified as dangerous or undesirable.&quot;

Although the first example of civilian internment may date as far back as the 1830s, the English term &quot;concentration camp&quot; was first used in order to refer to the reconcentration camps (Spanish:&quot;reconcentrados&quot;) which were set up by the Spanish military in Cuba during the Ten Years&#x27; War (1868–1878). The label was applied yet again to camps set up by the United States during the Philippine–American War (1899–1902). And expanded usage of the &quot;concentration camp&quot; label continued, when the British set up camps during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) in South Africa for interning Boers during the same time period. The German Empire also established concentration camps during the Herero and Namaqua genocide (1904–1907); the death rate of these camps was 45 per cent, twice that of the British camps.

===Russian camps===
The Russian Empire used forced exile and forced labour as forms of judicial punishment. Katorga, a category of punishment which was reserved for those who were convicted of the most serious crimes, had many of the features which were associated with labor-camp imprisonment. According to historian Anne Applebaum, katorga was not a common sentence; approximately 6,000 katorga convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 in 1916. These camps served as a model for political imprisonment during the Soviet period. In the midst of the Russian Civil War, Lenin and the Bolsheviks established &quot;special&quot; prison camps, separate from its traditional prison system and under the control of the Cheka. These camps, as Lenin envisioned them, had a distinctly political purpose. These concentration camps were not identical to the Stalinist, but were introduced to isolate war prisoners given the extreme historical situation following World War 1. In 1929, the distinction between criminal and political prisoners was eliminated, administration of the camps was turned over to the Joint State Political Directorate, and the camps were greatly expanded to the point that they comprised a significant portion of the Soviet economy. This Gulag system consisted of several hundred camps for most of its existence and detained some 18 million from 1929 until 1953. As part of a series of reforms during the Khrushchev Thaw, the Gulag shrank to a quarter of its former size and receded in its significance in Soviet society.

===Nazi German camps===
The Nazi Germany first established concentration camps for tens of thousands of political prisoners, primarily members of the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany, in 1933, detaining tens of thousands of prisoners. Many camps were closed following releases of prisoners at the end of the year, and the camp population would continue to dwindle through 1936; this trend would reverse in 1937, with the Nazi regime arresting tens of thousands of &quot;anti-socials&quot;, a category that included Romani people as well as the homeless, mentally ill, and social non-conformists. Jews were increasingly targeted beginning in 1938. Following the Nazi invasion of Poland and the beginning of World War II, the camps were massively expanded and became increasingly deadly. At its peak, the Nazi concentration camp system was extensive, with as many as 15,000 camps and at least 715,000 simultaneous internees. About 1.65 million people were registered prisoners in the camps, of whom about a million died during their imprisonment. The total number of casualties in these camps is difficult to determine, but the deliberate policy of extermination through labor in many of the camps was designed to ensure that the inmates would die of starvation, untreated disease and summary executions within set periods of time. In addition to the concentration camps, Nazi Germany established six extermination camps, specifically designed to kill millions of people, primarily by gassing. As a result, the term &quot;concentration camp&quot; is sometimes conflated with the concept of an &quot;extermination camp&quot; and historians debate whether the term &quot;concentration camp&quot; or the term &quot;internment camp&quot; should be used to describe other examples of civilian internment.

===Other camps===
Before and during World War II, concentration camps were established by various authorities. In the late 1920s, the Dutch colonial government established the Boven-Digoel concentration camp in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) to intern Indonesian nationalist leaders and political dissidents. Also during World War II, concentration camps were established by Italian, Japanese, US, and Canadian forces.

The former label continues to see expanded use for cases post-World War II, for instance in relation to British camps in Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion (1952–1960), and camps set up in Chile during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet (1973–1990). According to the United States Department of Defense as many as 3 million Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups are being held in China&#x27;s internment camps which are located in the Xinjiang region and which American news reports often label as &quot;concentration camps&quot;. The camps were established in the late 2010s under Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s administration.

<doc id="266601" wikidata="Q216778" url="?curid=266601" title="Refracting telescope">
<text>A refracting telescope (also called a refractor) is a type of optical telescope that uses a lens as its objective to form an image (also referred to a [[dioptrics|dioptric]] [[telescope]]). The refracting telescope design was originally used in spyglasses and astronomical telescopes but is also used for long-focus camera lenses. Although large refracting telescopes were very popular in the second half of the 19th century, for most research purposes, the refracting telescope has been superseded by the reflecting telescope, which allows larger apertures. A refractor&#x27;s magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the objective lens by that of the eyepiece.

Refracting telescopes typically have a lens at the front, then a long tube, then an eyepiece or instrumentation at the rear, where the telescope view comes to focus. Originally, telescopes had an objective of one element, but a century later, two and even three element lenses were made.

Refracting telescopes use technology that has often been applied to other optical devices, such as binoculars and zoom lenses/telephoto lens/long-focus lens.

==Invention==

Refractors were the earliest type of optical telescope. The first record of a refracting telescope appeared in the Netherlands about 1608, when a spectacle maker from Middelburg named Hans Lippershey unsuccessfully tried to patent one. News of the patent spread fast and Galileo Galilei, happening to be in Venice in the month of May 1609, heard of the invention, constructed a version of his own, and applied it to making astronomical discoveries.

==Refracting telescope designs==

All refracting telescopes use the same principles. The combination of an objective lens 1 and some type of eyepiece 2 is used to gather more light than the human eye is able to collect on its own, focus it 5, and present the viewer with a brighter, , and magnified virtual image 6.

The objective in a refracting telescope refracts or bends light. This refraction causes parallel light rays to converge at a focal point; while those not parallel converge upon a focal plane. The telescope converts a bundle of parallel rays to make an angle α, with the optical axis to a second parallel bundle with angle β. The ratio β/α is called the angular magnification. It equals the ratio between the retinal image sizes obtained with and without the telescope.

Refracting telescopes can come in many different configurations to correct for image orientation and types of aberration. Because the image was formed by the bending of light, or refraction, these telescopes are called &quot;refracting telescopes&quot; or &quot;refractors&quot;.

===Galilean telescope===

The design Galileo Galilei used is commonly called a Galilean telescope. It used a convergent (plano-convex) objective lens and a divergent (plano-concave) eyepiece lens (Galileo, 1610). A Galilean telescope, because the design has no intermediary focus, results in a non-inverted (i.e., upright) image.

Galileo&#x27;s most powerful telescope, with a total length of just under , magnified objects about 30 times. Galileo had to work with the poor lens technology of the time, and found he had to use aperture stops to reduce the diameter of the objective lens (increase its focal ratio) to limit aberrations, so his telescope produced blurry and distorted images with a narrow field of view. Despite these flaws, the telescope was still good enough for Galileo to explore the sky. He used it to view craters on the Moon, the four largest moons of Jupiter, and the phases of Venus.

Parallel rays of light from a distant object (y) would be brought to a focus in the focal plane of the objective lens (F′ L1 / y′). The (diverging) eyepiece (L2) lens intercepts these rays and renders them parallel once more. Non-parallel rays of light from the object traveling at an angle α1 to the optical axis travel at a larger angle (α2 &gt; α1) after they passed through the eyepiece. This leads to an increase in the apparent angular size and is responsible for the perceived magnification.

The final image (y″) is a virtual image, located at infinity and is the same way up (i.e., non-inverted or upright) as the object.

===Keplerian telescope===

The Keplerian telescope, invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, is an improvement on Galileo&#x27;s design. It uses a convex lens as the eyepiece instead of Galileo&#x27;s concave one. The advantage of this arrangement is that the rays of light emerging from the eyepiece are converging. This allows for a much wider field of view and greater eye relief, but the image for the viewer is inverted. Considerably higher magnifications can be reached with this design, but, like the Galilean telescope, it still uses simple single element objective lens so needs to have a very high focal ratio to reduce aberrations (Johannes Hevelius built an unwieldy f/225 telescope with a objective and a focal length, and even longer tubeless &quot;aerial telescopes&quot; were constructed). The design also allows for use of a micrometer at the focal plane (to determine the angular size and/or distance between objects observed).

Huygens built an aerial telescope for Royal Society of London with a 19 cm (7.5″) single-element lens.

===Achromatic refractors===
The next major step in the evolution of refracting telescopes was the invention of the achromatic lens, a lens with multiple elements that helped solve problems with chromatic aberration and allowed shorter focal lengths. It was invented in 1733 by an English barrister named Chester Moore Hall, although it was independently invented and patented by John Dollond around 1758. The design overcame the need for very long focal lengths in refracting telescopes by using an objective made of two pieces of glass with different dispersion, &#x27;crown&#x27; and &#x27;flint glass&#x27;, to reduce chromatic and spherical aberration. Each side of each piece is ground and polished, and then the two pieces are assembled together. Achromatic lenses are corrected to bring two wavelengths (typically red and blue) into focus in the same plane.

Chester More Hall is noted as having made the first twin color corrected lens in 1730.

Dollond achromats were quite popular in the 18th century. A major appeal was they could be made shorter. However, problems with glass making meant that the glass objectives were not made more than about in diameter.

In the late 19th century, the Swiss optician Pierre-Louis Guinand developed a way to make higher quality glass blanks of greater than . He passed this technology to his apprentice Joseph von Fraunhofer, who further developed this technology and also developed the Fraunhofer doublet lens design. The breakthrough in glass making techniques led to the great refractors of the 19th century, that became progressively larger through the decade, eventually reaching over 1 meter by the end of that century before being superseded by silvered-glass reflecting telescopes in astronomy.

Noted lens makers of the 19th century include:
*Alvan Clark
*Brashear
*Chance Brothers
*Cauchoix
*Fraunhofer
* Gautier 
*Grubb 
*Henry Brothers
*Lerebours
*Tulley

Some famous 19th century doublet refractors are the James Lick telescope (91 cm/36 in) and the Greenwich 28 inch refractor (71 cm). An example of an older refractor is the Shuckburgh telescope (dating to the late 1700s). A famous refractor was the &quot;Trophy Telescope&quot;, presented at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. The era of the &#x27;great refractors&#x27; in the 19th century saw large achromatic lenses, culminating with the largest achromatic refractor ever built, the Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900.

In the Royal Observatory, Greenwich an 1838 instrument named the Sheepshanks telescope includes an objective by Cauchoix. The Sheepshanks had a wide lens, and was the biggest telescope at Greenwich for about twenty years.

An 1840 report from the Observatory noted of the then-new Sheepshanks telescope with the Cauchoix doublet:In the 1900s a noted optics maker was Zeiss. An example of prime achievements of refractors, over 7 million people have been able to view through the 12-inch Zeiss refractor at Griffith Observatory since its opening in 1935; this is the most people to have viewed through any telescope.

Achromats were popular in astronomy for making star catalogs, and they required less maintenance than metal mirrors. Some famous discoveries using achromats are the planet Neptune and the Moons of Mars.

The long achromats, despite having smaller aperture than the larger reflectors, were often favored for &quot;prestige&quot; observatories. In the late 18th century, every few years, a larger and longer refractor would debut.

For example, the Nice Observatory debuted with refractor, the largest at the time, but was surpassed within only a couple of years.

===Apochromatic refractors===
Apochromatic refractors have objectives built with special, extra-low dispersion materials. They are designed to bring three wavelengths (typically red, green, and blue) into focus in the same plane. The residual color error (tertiary spectrum) can be an order of magnitude less than that of an achromatic lens. Such telescopes contain elements of fluorite or special, extra-low dispersion (ED) glass in the objective and produce a very crisp image that is virtually free of chromatic aberration. Due to the special materials needed in the fabrication, apochromatic refractors are usually more expensive than telescopes of other types with a comparable aperture.

In the 18th century, Dollond, a popular maker of doublet telescopes, also made a triplet, although they were not really as popular as the two element telescopes.

One of the famous triplet objectives is the Cooke triplet, noted for being able to correct the Seidal aberrations. It is recognized as one of the most important objective designs in the field of photography. The Cooke triplet can correct, with only three elements, for one wavelength, spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, field curvature, and distortion.

== Technical considerations ==
Refractors suffer from residual chromatic and spherical aberration. This affects shorter focal ratios more than longer ones. An achromatic refractor is likely to show considerable color fringing (generally a purple halo around bright objects); an 16 achromat has much less color fringing.

In very large apertures, there is also a problem of lens sagging, a result of gravity deforming glass. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens sags due to gravity, distorting the images it produces. The largest practical lens size in a refracting telescope is around .

There is a further problem of glass defects, striae or small air bubbles trapped within the glass. In addition, glass is opaque to certain wavelengths, and even visible light is dimmed by reflection and absorption when it crosses the air-glass interfaces and passes through the glass itself. Most of these problems are avoided or diminished in reflecting telescopes, which can be made in far larger apertures and which have all but replaced refractors for astronomical research.

The ISS-WAC on the Voyager 1/2 used a lens, launched into space in the late 1970s, an example of the use of refractors in space.

==Applications and achievements==
Refracting telescopes were noted for their use in astronomy as well as for terrestrial viewing. Many early discoveries of the Solar System were made with singlet refractors.

The use of refracting telescopic optics are ubiquitous in photography, and are also used in Earth orbit.

One of the more famous applications of the refracting telescope was when Galileo used it to discover the four largest moons of Jupiter in 1609. Furthermore, early refractors were also used several decades later to discover Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, along with three more of Saturn&#x27;s moons.

In the 19th century, refracting telescopes were used for pioneering work on astrophotography and spectroscopy, and the related instrument, the heliometer, was used to calculate the distance to another star for the first time. Their modest apertures did not lead to as many discoveries and typically so small in aperture that many astronomical objects were simply not observable until the advent of long-exposure photography, by which time the reputation and quirks of reflecting telescopes were beginning to exceed those of the refractors. Despite this, some discoveries include the Moons of Mars, a fifth Moon of Jupiter, and many double star discoveries including Sirius (the Dog star). Refractors were often used for positional astronomy, besides from the other uses in photography and terrestrial viewing.
;Singlets
The Galilean moons and many other moons of the solar system, were discovered with single-element objectives and aerial telescopes.

Galileo Galilei&#x27;s discovered the Galilean satellites of Jupiter in 1610 with a refracting telescope.

The planet Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan, was discovered on March 25, 1655, by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.

;Doublets
In 1861, the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius, was found to have smaller stellar companion using the 18 and half-inch Dearborn refracting telescope.

By the 18th century refractors began to have major competition from reflectors, which could be made quite large and did not normally suffer from the same inherent problem with chromatic aberration. Nevertheless, the astronomical community continued to use doublet refractors of modest aperture in comparison to modern instruments. Noted discoveries include the Moons of Mars and a fifth moon of Jupiter, Amalthea.

Asaph Hall discovered Deimos on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC and Phobos on 18 August 1877, at the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 GMT (contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon, give the time of discovery as 11 August 14:40 and 17 August 16:06 Washington mean time respectively).

The telescope used for the discovery was the refractor (telescope with a lens) then located at Foggy Bottom. In 1893 the lens was remounted and put in a new dome, where it remains into the 21st century.

Jupiter&#x27;s moon Amalthea was discovered on 9 September 1892, by Edward Emerson Barnard using the refractor telescope at Lick Observatory. It was discovered by direct visual observation with the doublet-lens refractor.

In 1904, one of the discoveries made using Great Refractor of Potsdam (a double telescope with two doublets) was of the interstellar medium. The astronomer Professor Hartmann determined from observations of the binary star Mintaka in Orion, that there was the element calcium in the intervening space.

;Triplets

Planet Pluto was discovered by looking at photographs (i.e. &#x27;plates&#x27; in astronomy vernacular) in a blink comparator taken with a refracting telescope, an astrograph with a 3 element 13-inch lens.

<text>A daylily, day lily or ditch-lily is a flowering plant in the genus Hemerocallis , a member of the family Asphodelaceae, subfamily Hemerocallidoideae, native to Asia. Despite the common name, it is not taxonomically classified in the lily genus. Gardening enthusiasts and horticulturists have long bred &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; species for their attractive flowers; a select few species of the genus have edible petals, while some are extremely toxic. Thousands of cultivars have been registered by the American Daylily Society, the only internationally recognized registrant according to the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants. The plants are perennial, bulbous plants, whose common name alludes to its flowers, which typically last about a day.

== Description ==

&quot;Hemerocallis&quot; are herbaceous clump-forming perennials growing from rhizomes, some produce spreading stolons. They have a fibrous or fibrous-tuberous root system with contractile roots. The tuberous roots are used to store nutrients and water. The arching leaves are produced from the base of the plant (basal) and lack petioles, they are strap-like, long, linear lanceolate leaves and grouped into opposite fans. The crown is the small portion between the leaves and the roots. The large showy flowers are produced on scapes. The slightly irregular shaped flowers are arranged in helicoid cymes, or produced solitarily. The scapes of some species and cultivars produce small leafy proliferations arising from the nodes or in bracts. The proliferations are clones that root when planted.

Typically &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; flowers have three similar petals and three sepals, collectively called tepals, and each have a midrib. The centermost part of the flower, called the throat, may be a different color than the more distal areas of the tepals. Each flower has six stamens joined to the perianth tube, each with a two-lobed anther. The unequal stamen filaments are curved upward with the linear-oblong anthers dorsifixed. The superior ovary is green, with three chambers and the stigma is 3-lobed or capitate. The fruit is a capsule (often erroneously called a pod since botanical pods are found in Fabaceae). The fruits may have no seeds (sterile), or many relatively large, shiny, black, roundish seeds. The flowers of most species open in early morning and wither during the following night, possibly replaced by another one on the same scape the next day. Some species are night-blooming. The haploid number of chromosomes is eleven.

==Taxonomy==
Despite their common name, daylilies are not true lilies (plants from the genus &quot;Lilium&quot;, family Liliaceae). Although the flowers of &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; and &quot;Lilium&quot; species have a similar shape, their growth habits, stems and leaf shapes are distinctive. Before 2009, the scientific classification of daylilies put them into the family Liliaceae. In 2009, under the APG III system, daylilies were removed from the family Liliaceae and assigned to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae, subfamily Hemerocallidoideae. Xanthorrhoeaceae was renamed in 2016 to Asphodelaceae in the APG IV system

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; comes from the Greek words (&quot;hēmera&quot;) &quot;day&quot; and (&quot;kalos&quot;) &quot;beautiful&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Hemerocallis&quot; species are native to Asia, primarily eastern Asia, including China, Korea, Japan and southern Siberia. This genus is popular worldwide because of the showy flowers and hardiness of many kinds. There are over 80,000 registered cultivars. Hundreds of cultivars have fragrant flowers, and more scented cultivars are appearing more frequently in northern hybridization programs. Some earlier blooming cultivars rebloom later in the season, particularly if their capsules, in which seeds are developing, are removed.

Daylilies have been found growing wild for millennia throughout China, Mongolia, northern India, Korea, and Japan. There are thousand-year-old Chinese paintings showing orange daylilies that are remarkably similar to the flowers that grace modern gardens.

Daylilies may have been first brought to Europe by traders along the silk routes from Asia. However it was not until 1753 that daylilies were given their botanic name of &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus.

Daylilies were first brought to North America by early European immigrants, who packed the roots along with other treasured possessions for the journey to the New World. By the early 1800s, the plant had become naturalized, and a bright orange clump of flowers was a common sight in many homestead gardens.

The orange or tawny daylily (&quot;Hemerocallis fulva&quot;), common along roadsides in much of North America, is native to Asia. Along with the lemon lily (&quot;Hemerocallis flava&quot;), it is the foundational species for most modern cultivars.

==Cultivation==
As popular as daylilies were for many hundreds of years, it was not until the late 19th century that botanists and gardeners began to experiment with hybridizing the plants. Over the next hundred years, thousands of different hybrids were developed from only a few wild varieties. In fact, most modern hybrids are descended from two types of daylily. One is &quot;Hemerocallis flava&quot;—the yellow lemon lily. The other is &quot;Hemerocallis fulva&quot;, the familiar tawny-orange daylily, also known affectionately as the &quot;ditch lily&quot;.

The daylily has been nicknamed &quot;the perfect perennial&quot; by gardeners, due to its brilliant colors, ability to tolerate drought and frost and to thrive in many different climate zones, and for being generally low maintenance. It is a vigorous perennial that lasts for many years in a garden, with very little care and adapts to many different soil and light conditions. Daylilies have a relatively short blooming period, depending on the type. Some will bloom in early spring while others wait until the summer or even autumn. Most daylily plants bloom for 1 through 5 weeks, although some bloom twice in one season (&quot;rebloomers)&quot;. Daylilies are not commonly used as cut flowers for formal flower arranging, yet they make good cut flowers otherwise, as new flowers continue to open on cut stems over several days.

===Cultivars===
There are more than 100,000 daylily cultivars, the milestone having been achieved in 2024 Depending on the species and cultivar, daylilies grow in USDA plant hardiness zones 1 through 11, making them some of the more adaptable landscape plants. Hybridizers have developed the vast majority of cultivars within the last 100 years. The large-flowered, bright yellow &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; &#x27;Hyperion&#x27;, introduced in the 1920s, heralded a return to gardens of the once-dismissed daylily, and is still widely available in the nursery trade. Daylily breeding has been a specialty in the United States, where daylily heat- and drought-resistance made them garden standbys since the 1950s. New cultivars have sold for thousands of dollars, but many sturdy and prolific cultivars sell at reasonable prices of US$20 or less.

&quot;Hemerocallis&quot; is one of the very highly hybridized plant genera. Hybridizers register hundreds of new cultivars yearly. Hybridizers have extended the genus&#x27; color range from the yellow, orange, and pale pink of the species, through vibrant reds, purples, lavenders, greenish tones, near-black, near-white, and more. However, hybridizers have not yet been able to produce a daylily with primarily blue flowers. Flowers of some cultivars have small areas of bluish shades, particularly in the eyezones.

Other flower traits that hybridizers developed include height, scent, ruffled edges, doubling, contrasting &quot;eyes&quot; in the center of a bloom, fringed edges called ‘teeth’, and an illusion of glitter called &quot;diamond dust&quot;. Sought-after improvements include rust resistance, foliage color, variegation, plant disease resistance, and the ability to form large, neat clumps. Hybridizers also seek to make cultivars cold-hardier by crossing evergreen and semi-evergreen plants with dormant varieties. 
In recent decades, many hybridizers have focused on breeding tetraploid plants, which tend to have sturdier scapes and tepals than diploids, as well as some flower-color traits that are not found in diploids. Until this trend took root, nearly all daylilies were diploid. Tetraploid cultivars have 44 chromosomes, while triploids have 33 chromosomes and diploids have 22 chromosomes per individual plant. Diploid and tetraploid daylilies cannot be crossed to produce new cultivars &quot;Hemerocallis fulva&quot; &#x27;Europa&#x27;, &quot;H. fulva&quot; &#x27;Kwanso&#x27;, &quot;H. fulva&quot; &#x27;Kwanso Variegata&#x27;, &quot;H. fulva&quot; &#x27;Kwanso Kaempfer&#x27;, &quot;H. fulva&quot; var. &quot;maculata&quot;, &quot;H. fulva&quot; var. &quot;angustifolia&quot;, and &quot;H. fulva&quot; &#x27;Flore Pleno&#x27; are all triploids that almost never produce seeds and reproduce almost solely by underground runners (stolons) and dividing groups by gardeners. A polymerous daylily flower is one with more than three sepals and more than three petals. Although some people synonymize &quot;polymerous&quot; with &quot;double&quot;, some polymerous flowers have as many as twice the normal number of sepals and petals.

Formerly daylilies were only available in yellow, pink, fulvous (bronzed), and rosy-fulvous colors, now they come in an assortment of many more color shades and tints thanks to intensive hybridization. They can now be found in nearly every color except pure blue and pure white. Those with yellow, pink, and other pastel flowers may require full sun to bring out all of their colors; darker varieties, including many of those with red and purple flowers are not colorfast in bright sun.
==== Awards ====
The highest award a cultivar can receive in the United States is the Stout Silver Medal, given in memory of Dr. Arlow Burdette Stout, who is considered to be the father of modern daylily breeding in North America. This annual award—as voted by American Hemerocallis Society (AHS) Garden judges—can be given only to a cultivar that has first received the Award of Merit not less than two years previously. The 2014 winner of the Stout Silver Medal is &#x27;Webster&#x27;s Pink Wonder&#x27;, hybridized by Richard Webster and introduced by R. Cobb. A complete list of Stout Silver Medal winners can be seen on the AHS website.

=== Pests and diseases ===
&quot;Contarinia quinquenotata&quot;, commonly known as the daylily gall midge, is a small gray insect infesting the flower buds of &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; species causing the flower to remain closed and rot. It is a pest within the horticultural trade in several parts of the world, including Southern and Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.

==Toxicity==
Eating too many uncooked flowers of some species can cause diarrhea. &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; species are toxic to cats and ingestion may be fatal. Treatment is usually successful if started before kidney failure has developed.

==Uses==
Daylilies are an economically important group of plants used medicinally, as food, and as horticultural plants. They have been cultivated in East Asia starting in China for thousands of years. Hemerocallin, a root neurotoxin, has been used as poison and therapeutically as part of traditional oriental medicine. Some flowers of certain species such as &quot;Hemerocallis citrina&quot; are used in Chinese cuisine. They are sold fresh or dried in Asian markets as gum jum ( in Chinese; pinyin: jīn zhēn) or yellow flower vegetables ( in Chinese; pinyin: huáng huā cài). These are used in hot and sour soup, daylily soup (金針花湯), Buddha&#x27;s delight, and moo shu pork. The tubers and young leaves of &quot;H. fulva&quot; can be eaten raw or cooked. The flowers are more palatable upon cooking. 

Moreover, Daylilies are among the most popular North American garden plants. Registered cultivars of &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; now exceed 38,000, including more than 13,000 named clones of &quot;H. fulva&quot;.

<text>An optical telescope gathers and focuses light mainly from the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, to create a magnified image for direct visual inspection, to make a photograph, or to collect data through electronic image sensors.

There are three primary types of optical telescope :
* &quot;Refracting telescopes&quot;, which use lenses and less commonly also prisms (dioptrics)
* &quot;Reflecting telescopes&quot;, which use mirrors (catoptrics)
* &quot;Catadioptric telescopes&quot;, which combine lenses and mirrors

An optical telescope&#x27;s ability to resolve small details is directly related to the diameter (or aperture) of its objective (the primary lens or mirror that collects and focuses the light), and its light-gathering power is related to the area of the objective. The larger the objective, the more light the telescope collects and the finer detail it resolves.

People use optical telescopes (including monoculars and binoculars) for outdoor activities such as observational astronomy, ornithology, pilotage, hunting and reconnaissance, as well as indoor/semi-outdoor activities such as watching performance arts and spectator sports.

==History==
The telescope is more a discovery of optical craftsmen than an invention of a scientist. The lens and the properties of refracting and reflecting light had been known since antiquity, and theory on how they worked was developed by ancient Greek philosophers, preserved and expanded on in the medieval Islamic world, and had reached a significantly advanced state by the time of the telescope&#x27;s invention in early modern Europe. But the most significant step cited in the invention of the telescope was the development of lens manufacture for spectacles, first in Venice and Florence in the thirteenth century, and later in the spectacle making centers in both the Netherlands and Germany. It is in the Netherlands in 1608 where the first documents describing a refracting optical telescope surfaced in the form of a patent filed by spectacle maker Hans Lippershey, followed a few weeks later by claims by Jacob Metius, and a third unknown applicant, that they also knew of this &quot;art&quot;.

Word of the invention spread fast and Galileo Galilei, on hearing of the device, was making his own improved designs within a year and was the first to publish astronomical results using a telescope. Galileo&#x27;s telescope used a convex objective lens and a concave eye lens, a design is now called a Galilean telescope. Johannes Kepler proposed an improvement on the design that used a convex eyepiece, often called the Keplerian Telescope.

The next big step in the development of refractors was the advent of the Achromatic lens in the early 18th century, which corrected the chromatic aberration in Keplerian telescopes up to that time—allowing for much shorter instruments with much larger objectives.

For reflecting telescopes, which use a curved mirror in place of the objective lens, theory preceded practice. The theoretical basis for curved mirrors behaving similar to lenses was probably established by Alhazen, whose theories had been widely disseminated in Latin translations of his work. Soon after the invention of the refracting telescope, Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge that curved mirrors had similar properties to lenses, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. The potential advantages of using parabolic mirrors (primarily a reduction of spherical aberration with elimination of chromatic aberration) led to several proposed designs for reflecting telescopes, the most notable of which was published in 1663 by James Gregory and came to be called the Gregorian telescope, but no working models were built. Isaac Newton has been generally credited with constructing the first practical reflecting telescopes, the Newtonian telescope, in 1668 although due to their difficulty of construction and the poor performance of the speculum metal mirrors used it took over 100 years for reflectors to become popular. Many of the advances in reflecting telescopes included the perfection of parabolic mirror fabrication in the 18th century, silver coated glass mirrors in the 19th century, long-lasting aluminum coatings in the 20th century, segmented mirrors to allow larger diameters, and active optics to compensate for gravitational deformation. A mid-20th century innovation was catadioptric telescopes such as the Schmidt camera, which uses both a lens (corrector plate) and mirror as primary optical elements, mainly used for wide field imaging without spherical aberration.

The late 20th century has seen the development of adaptive optics and space telescopes to overcome the problems of astronomical seeing.

The electronics revolution of the early 21st century led to the development of computer-connected telescopes in the 2010s that allow non-professional skywatchers to observe stars and satellites using relatively low-cost equipment by taking advantage of digital astrophotographic techniques developed by professional astronomers over previous decades. An electronic connection to a computer (smartphone, pad, or laptop) is required to make astronomical observations from the telescopes. The digital technology allows multiple images to be stacked while subtracting the noise component of the observation producing images of Messier objects and faint stars as dim as an apparent magnitude of 15 with consumer-grade equipment.

==Principles==
The basic scheme is that the primary light-gathering element, the objective (1) (the convex lens or concave mirror used to gather the incoming light), focuses that light from the distant object (4) to a focal plane where it forms a real image (5). This image may be recorded or viewed through an eyepiece (2), which acts like a magnifying glass. The eye (3) then sees an inverted, magnified virtual image (6) of the object.

===Inverted images===

Most telescope designs produce an inverted image at the focal plane; these are referred to as &quot;inverting telescopes&quot;. In fact, the image is both turned upside down and reversed left to right, so that altogether it is rotated by 180 degrees from the object orientation. In astronomical telescopes the rotated view is normally not corrected, since it does not affect how the telescope is used. However, a mirror diagonal is often used to place the eyepiece in a more convenient viewing location, and in that case the image is erect, but still reversed left to right. In terrestrial telescopes such as spotting scopes, monoculars and binoculars, prisms (e.g., Porro prisms) or a relay lens between objective and eyepiece are used to correct the image orientation. There are telescope designs that do not present an inverted image such as the Galilean refractor and the Gregorian reflector. These are referred to as &quot;erecting telescopes&quot;.

===Design variants===
Many types of telescope fold or divert the optical path with secondary or tertiary mirrors. These may be integral part of the optical design (Newtonian telescope, Cassegrain reflector or similar types), or may simply be used to place the eyepiece or detector at a more convenient position. Telescope designs may also use specially designed additional lenses or mirrors to improve image quality over a larger field of view.
==Characteristics==

Design specifications relate to the characteristics of the telescope and how it performs optically. Several properties of the specifications may change with the equipment or accessories used with the telescope; such as Barlow lenses, star diagonals and eyepieces. These interchangeable accessories do not alter the specifications of the telescope, however they alter the way the telescope&#x27;s properties function, typically magnification, apparent field of view (FOV) and actual field of view.

===Surface resolvability===
The smallest resolvable surface area of an object, as seen through an optical telescope, is the limited physical area that can be resolved. It is analogous to angular resolution, but differs in definition: instead of separation ability between point-light sources it refers to the physical area that can be resolved. A familiar way to express the characteristic is the resolvable ability of features such as Moon craters or Sun spots. Expression using the formula is given by twice the resolving power formula_1 over aperture diameter formula_2 multiplied by the objects diameter formula_3 multiplied by the constant formula_4 all divided by the objects apparent diameter formula_5.

&quot;Resolving power formula_1 is derived from the wavelength formula_7 using the same unit as aperture; where 550 nm to mm is given by: formula_8.&quot;
&quot;The constant formula_4 is derived from radians to the same unit as the object&#x27;s apparent diameter; where the Moon&#x27;s apparent diameter of formula_10 radians to arcsecs is given by: formula_11.&quot;

An example using a telescope with an aperture of 130 mm observing the Moon in a 550 nm wavelength, is given by: formula_12

The unit used in the object diameter results in the smallest resolvable features at that unit. In the above example they are approximated in kilometers resulting in the smallest resolvable Moon craters being 3.22 km in diameter. The Hubble Space Telescope has a primary mirror aperture of 2400 mm that provides a surface resolvability of Moon craters being 174.9 meters in diameter, or sunspots of 7365.2 km in diameter.

===Angular resolution===
Ignoring blurring of the image by turbulence in the atmosphere (atmospheric seeing) and optical imperfections of the telescope, the angular resolution of an optical telescope is determined by the diameter of the primary mirror or lens gathering the light (also termed its &quot;aperture&quot;).

The Rayleigh criterion for the resolution limit formula_13 (in radians) is given by
:formula_14
where formula_15 is the wavelength and formula_2 is the aperture. For visible light (formula_15 = 550 nm) in the small-angle approximation, this equation can be rewritten:
:formula_18
Here, formula_13 denotes the resolution limit in arcseconds and formula_2 is in millimeters.
In the ideal case, the two components of a double star system can be discerned even if separated by slightly less than formula_13. This is taken into account by the Dawes limit
:formula_22
The equation shows that, all else being equal, the larger the aperture, the better the angular resolution. The resolution is not given by the maximum magnification (or &quot;power&quot;) of a telescope. Telescopes marketed by giving high values of the maximum power often deliver poor images.

For large ground-based telescopes, the resolution is limited by atmospheric seeing. This limit can be overcome by placing the telescopes above the atmosphere, e.g., on the summits of high mountains, on balloons and high-flying airplanes, or in space. Resolution limits can also be overcome by adaptive optics, speckle imaging or lucky imaging for ground-based telescopes.

Recently, it has become practical to perform aperture synthesis with arrays of optical telescopes. Very high resolution images can be obtained with groups of widely spaced smaller telescopes, linked together by carefully controlled optical paths, but these interferometers can only be used for imaging bright objects such as stars or measuring the bright cores of active galaxies.

===Focal length and focal ratio===
The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light. For an optical system in air, it is the distance over which initially collimated rays are brought to a focus. A system with a shorter focal length has greater optical power than one with a long focal length; that is, it bends the rays more strongly, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance. In astronomy, the f-number is commonly referred to as the &quot;focal ratio&quot; notated as formula_23. The focal ratio of a telescope is defined as the focal length formula_24 of an objective divided by its diameter formula_2 or by the diameter of an aperture stop in the system. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.

An example of a telescope with a focal length of 1200 mm and aperture diameter of 254 mm is given by:
formula_26

Numerically large Focal ratios are said to be &quot;long&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;. Small numbers are &quot;short&quot; or &quot;fast&quot;. There are no sharp lines for determining when to use these terms, and an individual may consider their own standards of determination. Among contemporary astronomical telescopes, any telescope with a focal ratio slower (bigger number) than f/12 is generally considered slow, and any telescope with a focal ratio faster (smaller number) than f/6, is considered fast. Faster systems often have more optical aberrations away from the center of the field of view and are generally more demanding of eyepiece designs than slower ones. A fast system is often desired for practical purposes in astrophotography with the purpose of gathering more photons in a given time period than a slower system, allowing time lapsed photography to process the result faster.

Wide-field telescopes (such as astrographs), are used to track satellites and asteroids, for cosmic-ray research, and for astronomical surveys of the sky. It is more difficult to reduce optical aberrations in telescopes with low f-ratio than in telescopes with larger f-ratio.

===Light-gathering power===
The light-gathering power of an optical telescope, also referred to as light grasp or aperture gain, is the ability of a telescope to collect a lot more light than the human eye. Its light-gathering power is probably its most important feature. The telescope acts as a &quot;light bucket&quot;, collecting all of the photons that come down on it from a far away object, where a larger bucket catches more photons resulting in more received light in a given time period, effectively brightening the image. This is why the pupils of your eyes enlarge at night so that more light reaches the retinas. The gathering power formula_27 compared against a human eye is the squared result of the division of the aperture formula_2 over the observer&#x27;s pupil diameter formula_29, with an average adult having a pupil diameter of 7 mm. Younger persons host larger diameters, typically said to be 9 mm, as the diameter of the pupil decreases with age.

An example gathering power of an aperture with 254 mm compared to an adult pupil diameter being 7 mm is given by: formula_30

Light-gathering power can be compared between telescopes by comparing the areas formula_31 of the two different apertures.

As an example, the light-gathering power of a 10-meter telescope is 25x that of a 2-meter telescope: formula_32

For a survey of a given area, the field of view is just as important as raw light gathering power. Survey telescopes such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope try to maximize the product of mirror area and field of view (or etendue) rather than raw light gathering ability alone.

===Magnification===
The magnification through a telescope makes an object appear larger while limiting the FOV. Magnification is often misleading as the optical power of the telescope, its characteristic is the most misunderstood term used to describe the observable world. At higher magnifications the image quality significantly reduces, usage of a Barlow lens increases the effective focal length of an optical system—multiplies image quality reduction.

Similar minor effects may be present when using star diagonals, as light travels through a multitude of lenses that increase or decrease effective focal length. The quality of the image generally depends on the quality of the optics (lenses) and viewing conditions—not on magnification.

Magnification itself is limited by optical characteristics. With any telescope or microscope, beyond a practical maximum magnification, the image looks bigger but shows no more detail. It occurs when the finest detail the instrument can resolve is magnified to match the finest detail the eye can see. Magnification beyond this maximum is sometimes called &quot;empty magnification&quot;.

To get the most detail out of a telescope, it is critical to choose the right magnification for the object being observed. Some objects appear best at low power, some at high power, and many at a moderate magnification. There are two values for magnification, a minimum and maximum. A wider field of view eyepiece may be used to keep the same eyepiece focal length whilst providing the same magnification through the telescope. For a good quality telescope operating in good atmospheric conditions, the maximum usable magnification is limited by diffraction.

====Visual====
The visual magnification formula_33 of the field of view through a telescope can be determined by the telescope&#x27;s focal length formula_24 divided by the eyepiece focal length formula_35 (or diameter). The maximum is limited by the focal length of the eyepiece.

An example of visual magnification using a telescope with a 1200 mm focal length and 3 mm eyepiece is given by: formula_36

==== Minimum ====
There are two issues constraining the lowest useful magnification on a telescope:
* The light beam exiting the eyepiece needs to be small enough to enter the pupil of the observer&#x27;s eye. If the cylinder of light emerging from they eyepiece is too wide to enter the observer&#x27;s eye, some of the light gathered by the telescope will be wasted, and the image seen will be dimmer and less clear than it would be at a higher magnification.
* For telescope designs with obstructions in the light path (e.g. most catadioptric telescopes, but &quot;not&quot; spyglass-style refracting telescopes) the magnification must be high enough to keep the central obstruction out of focus, to prevent it from coming into view as a central &quot;black spot&quot;. Both of these issues depend on the size of the pupil of the observer&#x27;s eye, which will be narrower in daylight and wider in the dark.

Both constraints boil down to approximately the same rule: The magnification of the viewed image, formula_37 must be high enough to make the eyepiece exit pupil, formula_38 no larger than the pupil of the observer&#x27;s own eye. The formula for the eypiece exit pupil is
:formula_39
where formula_40 is the light-collecting diameter of the telescope&#x27;s aperture.

Dark-adapted pupil sizes range from 8–9 mm for young children, to a &quot;normal&quot; or standard value of 7 mm for most adults aged 30–40, to 5–6 mm for retirees in their 60s and 70s. A lifetime spent exposed to chronically bright ambient light, such as sunlight reflected off of open fields of snow, or white-sand beaches, or cement, will tend to make individuals&#x27; pupils permanently smaller. Sunglasses greatly help, but once shrunk by long-time over-exposure to bright light, even the use of opthamalogic drugs cannot restore lost pupil size. Most observers&#x27; eyes instantly respond to darkness by widening the pupil to almost its maximum, although complete adaption to night vision generally takes at least a half-hour. (There is usually a slight extra widening of the pupil the longer the pupil remains dilated / relaxed.)
The improvement in brightness with reduced magnification has a limit related to something called the exit pupil. The exit pupil is the cylinder of light exiting the eyepiece and entering the pupil of the eye; hence the lower the magnification, the larger the exit pupil. It is the image of the shrunken sky-viewing aperture of the telescope, reduced by the magnification factor, formula_37 of the eyepiece-telescope combination:
:formula_42
where formula_43 is the focal length of the telescope and formula_44 is the focal length of the eyepiece.

Ideally, the exit pupil of the eyepiece, formula_38 matches the pupil of the observer&#x27;s eye: If the exit pupil from the eyepiece is larger than the pupil of individual observer&#x27;s eye, some of the light delivered from the telescope will be cut off. If the eyepiece exit pupil is the same or smaller than the pupil of the observer&#x27;s eye, then all of the light collected by the telescope aperture will enter the eye, with lower magnification producing a brighter image, as long as all of the captured light gets into the eye.

The minimum formula_46 can be calculated by dividing the telescope aperture formula_40 over the largest tolerated exit pupil diameter formula_48
:formula_49
Decreasing the magnification past this limit will not increase brightness nor improve clarity: Beyond this limit there is no benefit from lower magnification. Likewise calculating the exit pupil formula_50 is a division of the aperture diameter formula_40 and the visual magnification formula_52 used. The minimum often may not be reachable with some telescopes, a telescope with a very long focal length may require a longer focal length eyepiece than is available.

An example of the lowest usable magnification using a fairly common 10″ (254 mm) aperture and the standard adult 7 mm maximum exit pupil is given by: formula_53 If the telescope happened to have a focal length (formula_43), the longest recommended eyepiece focal length (formula_44) would be formula_56 An eyepiece of the same apparent field-of-view but longer focal-length will deliver a wider true field of view, but dimmer image. If the telescope has a central obstruction (e.g. a Newtonian, Maksutov, or Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope) it is also likely that the low magnification will make the obstruction come into focus enough to make a black spot in the middle of the image.

Calculating in the other direction, the exit pupil diameter of a 254 mm telescope aperture at 60× magnification is given by: formula_57 well within pupil size of dark-adapted eyes of observers of almost all ages. Assuming the same telescope focal length as above, the eyepiece focal length that would produce a 60× magnification is formula_58

====Optimum====
The following are rules-of-thumb for useful magnifications appropriate to different type objects:
* For small objects with low surface brightness (such as galaxies), use a moderate magnification.
* For small objects with moderate surface brightness (such as planetary nebulae), use a high magnification.
* For small objects with high surface brightness (such as planets), use the highest magnification that the current night&#x27;s &quot;seeing&quot; will allow, and consider adding in astronomical filters to sharpen the image.
* For large objects (such as the Andromeda Galaxy or wide-field diffuse nebulae), regardless of surface brightness use low magnification, often in the range of minimum magnification.
* For very to extremely bright, large objects (the Moon and the Sun) narrow-down the aperture of the telescope by covering it with a piece of cardboard with a small hole in it, and insert filters as-needed to both cut down excess brightness and to enhance the contrast of surface features.

Only personal experience determines the best optimum magnifications for objects, relying on observational skills and seeing conditions, and the status of the pupil of observer&#x27;s eye at the moment (e.g. a lower magnification may be required if there is enough moonlight to prevent complete dark adaption).

===Field of view===
Field of view is the extent of the observable world seen at any given moment, through an instrument (e.g., telescope or binoculars), or by naked eye. There are various expressions of field of view, being a specification of an eyepiece or a characteristic determined from an eyepiece and telescope combination. A physical limit derives from the combination where the FOV cannot be viewed larger than a defined maximum, due to diffraction of the optics.

====Apparent====
Apparent field of view (commonly referred to as AFOV) is the perceived angular size of the field stop of the eyepiece, typically measured in degrees. It is a fixed property of the eyepiece&#x27;s optical design, with common commercially available eyepieces offering a range of apparent fields from 40° to 120°. The apparent field of view of an eyepiece is limited by a combination of the eyepiece&#x27;s field stop diameter, and focal length, and is independent of magnification used.

In an eyepiece with a very wide apparent field of view, the observer may perceive that the view through the telescope stretches out to their peripheral vision, giving a sensation that they are no longer looking through an eyepiece, or that they are closer to the subject of interest than they really are. In contrast, an eyepiece with a narrow apparent field of view may give the sensation of looking through a tunnel or small porthole window, with the black field stop of the eyepiece occupying most of the observer&#x27;s vision.

A wider apparent field of view permits the observer to see more of the subject of interest (that is, a wider true field of view) without reducing magnification to do so. However, the relationship between true field of view, apparent field of view, and magnification is not direct, due to increasing distortion characteristics that correlate with wider apparent fields of view. Instead, both true field of view and apparent field of view are consequences of the eyepiece&#x27;s field stop diameter.

Apparent field of view differs from true field of view in so far as true field of view varies with magnification, whereas apparent field of view does not. The wider field stop of a wide angle eyepiece permits the viewing of a wider section of the real image formed at the telescope&#x27;s focal plane, thus impacting the calculated true field of view.

An eyepiece&#x27;s apparent field of view can influence total view brightness as perceived by the eye, since the apparent angular size of the field stop will determine how much of the observer&#x27;s retina is illuminated by the exit pupil formed by the eyepiece. However, apparent field of view has no impact on the apparent surface brightness (that is, brightness per unit area) of objects contained within the field of view.

====True====
True FOV is the width of what is actually seen through any given eyepiece / telescope combination.

There are two formulae for calculating true field of view:

# Apparent field of view method given by formula_59, where formula_60 is the true FOV, formula_61 is the apparent field of view of the eyepiece, and formula_33 is the magnification being used.
# Eyepiece field stop method given by formula_63, where formula_60 is the true FOV, formula_65 is the eyepiece field stop diameter in millimeters and formula_66 is the focal length of the telescope in millimeters.

The eyepiece field stop method is more accurate than the apparent field of view method, however not all eyepieces have an easily knowable field stop diameter.

====Maximum====
Max FOV is the maximum useful true field of view limited by the optics of the telescope. It is a physical limitation where increases beyond the maximum remain at maximum. Max FOV formula_67 is the barrel size formula_68 over the telescope&#x27;s focal length formula_24 converted from radian to degrees.

An example of max FOV using a telescope with a barrel size of 31.75 mm (1.25 inches) and focal length of 1200 mm is given by: formula_70

==Observing through a telescope==
There are many properties of optical telescopes and the complexity of observation using one can be a daunting task; experience and experimentation are the major contributors to understanding how to maximize one&#x27;s observations. In practice, only two main properties of a telescope determine how observation differs: the focal length and aperture. These relate as to how the optical system views an object or range and how much light is gathered through an ocular eyepiece. Eyepieces further determine how the field of view and magnification of the observable world change.

===Observable world===
The observable world is what can be seen using a telescope. When viewing an object or range, the observer may use many different techniques. Understanding what can be viewed and how to view it depends on the field of view. Viewing an object at a size that fits entirely in the field of view is measured using the two telescope properties—focal length and aperture, with the inclusion of an ocular eyepiece with suitable focal length (or diameter). Comparing the observable world and the angular diameter of an object shows how much of the object we see. However, the relationship with the optical system may not result in high surface brightness. Celestial objects are often dim because of their vast distance, and detail may be limited by diffraction or unsuitable optical properties.

===Field of view and magnification relationship===
Finding what can be seen through the optical system begins with the eyepiece providing the field of view and magnification; the magnification is given by the division of the telescope and eyepiece focal lengths. Using an example of an amateur telescope such as a Newtonian telescope with an aperture formula_2 of 130 mm (5&quot;) and focal length formula_24 of 650 mm (25.5 inches), one uses an eyepiece with a focal length formula_73 of 8 mm and apparent FOV formula_61 of 52°. The magnification at which the observable world is viewed is given by: formula_75. The field of view formula_60 requires the magnification, which is formulated by its division over the apparent field of view: formula_77. The resulting true field of view is 0.64°, not allowing an object such as the Orion nebula, which appears elliptical with an angular diameter of 65 × 60 arcminutes, to be viewable through the telescope in its entirety, where the whole of the nebula is within the observable world. Using methods such as this can greatly increase one&#x27;s viewing potential ensuring the observable world can contain the entire object, or whether to increase or decrease magnification viewing the object in a different aspect.

===Brightness factor===
The surface brightness at such a magnification significantly reduces, resulting in a far dimmer appearance. A dimmer appearance results in less visual detail of the object. Details such as matter, rings, spiral arms, and gases may be completely hidden from the observer, giving a far less &quot;complete&quot; view of the object or range. Physics dictates that at the theoretical minimum magnification of the telescope, the surface brightness is at 100%. Practically, however, various factors prevent 100% brightness; these include telescope limitations (focal length, eyepiece focal length, etc.) and the age of the observer.

Age plays a role in brightness, as a contributing factor is the observer&#x27;s pupil. With age the pupil naturally shrinks in diameter; generally accepted a young adult may have a 7 mm diameter pupil, an older adult as little as 5 mm, and a younger person larger at 9 mm. The minimum magnification formula_78 can be expressed as the division of the aperture formula_2 and pupil formula_80 diameter given by: formula_81. A problematic instance may be apparent, achieving a theoretical surface brightness of 100%, as the required effective focal length of the optical system may require an eyepiece with too large a diameter.

Some telescopes cannot achieve the theoretical surface brightness of 100%, while some telescopes can achieve it using a very small-diameter eyepiece. To find what eyepiece is required to get minimum magnification one can rearrange the magnification formula, where it is now the division of the telescope&#x27;s focal length over the minimum magnification: formula_82. An eyepiece of 35 mm is a non-standard size and would not be purchasable; in this scenario
to achieve 100% one would require a standard manufactured eyepiece size of 40 mm. As the eyepiece has a larger focal length than the minimum magnification, an abundance of wasted light is not received through the eyes.

===Exit pupil===
The limit to the increase in surface brightness as one reduces magnification is the exit pupil: a cylinder of light that projects out the eyepiece to the observer. An exit pupil must match or be smaller in diameter than one&#x27;s pupil to receive the full amount of projected light; a larger exit pupil results in the wasted light. The exit pupil formula_83 can be derived with from division of the telescope aperture formula_2 and the minimum magnification formula_78, derived by: formula_86. The pupil and exit pupil are almost identical in diameter, giving no wasted observable light with the optical system. A 7 mm pupil falls slightly short of 100% brightness, where the surface brightness formula_68 can be measured from the product of the constant 2, by the square of the pupil formula_80 resulting in: formula_89. The limitation here is the pupil diameter; it is an unfortunate result and degrades with age. Some observable light loss is expected and decreasing the magnification cannot increase surface brightness once the system has reached its minimum usable magnification, hence why the term is referred to as &quot;usable&quot;.

===Image Scale===
When using a CCD to record observations, the CCD is placed in the focal plane. Image scale (sometimes called &quot;plate scale&quot;) is how the angular size of the object being observed is related to the physical size of the projected image in the focal plane

:formula_90

where formula_91 is the image scale, formula_92 is the angular size of the observed object, and formula_93 is the physical size of the projected image. In terms of focal length image scale is

:formula_94

where formula_91 is measured in radians per meter (rad/m), and formula_24 is measured in meters. Normally formula_91 is given in units of arcseconds per millimeter (&quot;/mm). So if the focal length is measured in millimeters, the image scale is

:formula_98

The derivation of this equation is fairly straightforward and the result is the same for reflecting or refracting telescopes. However, conceptually it is easier to derive by considering a reflecting telescope. If an extended object with angular size formula_92 is observed through a telescope, then due to the Laws of reflection and Trigonometry the size of the image projected onto the focal plane will be

:formula_100

The image scale (angular size of object divided by size of projected image) will be

:formula_101

and by using the small angle relation formula_102, when formula_103 (N.B. only valid if formula_104 is in radians), we obtain

:formula_105

==Imperfect images==
No telescope can form a perfect image. Even if a reflecting telescope could have a perfect mirror, or a refracting telescope could have a perfect lens, the effects of aperture diffraction are unavoidable. In reality, perfect mirrors and perfect lenses do not exist, so image aberrations in addition to aperture diffraction must be taken into account. Image aberrations can be broken down into two main classes, monochromatic, and polychromatic. In 1857, Philipp Ludwig von Seidel (1821–1896) decomposed the first order monochromatic aberrations into five constituent aberrations. They are now commonly referred to as the five Seidel Aberrations.

===The five Seidel aberrations===

; Spherical aberration : The difference in focal length between paraxial rays and marginal rays, proportional to the square of the objective diameter.
; Coma : A defect by which points appear as comet-like asymmetrical patches of light with tails, which makes measurement very imprecise. Its magnitude is usually deduced from the optical sine theorem.
; Astigmatism : The image of a point forms focal lines at the sagittal and tangental foci and in between (in the absence of coma) an elliptical shape.
; Petzval field curvature: The Petzval field curvature means that the image, instead of lying in a plane, actually lies on a curved surface, described as hollow or round. This causes problems when a flat imaging device is used e.g., a photographic plate or CCD image sensor.
; Distortion: Either barrel or pincushion, a radial distortion that must be corrected when combining multiple images (similar to stitching multiple photos into a panoramic photo).

Optical defects are always listed in the above order, since this expresses their interdependence as first order aberrations via moves of the exit/entrance pupils. The first Seidel aberration, Spherical Aberration, is independent of the position of the exit pupil (as it is the same for axial and extra-axial pencils). The second, coma, changes as a function of pupil distance and spherical aberration, hence the well-known result that it is impossible to correct the coma in a lens free of spherical aberration by simply moving the pupil. Similar dependencies affect the remaining aberrations in the list.

===Chromatic aberrations===

: Longitudinal chromatic aberration: As with spherical aberration this is the same for axial and oblique pencils.
: Transverse chromatic aberration (chromatic aberration of magnification)

==Astronomical research telescopes==

Optical telescopes have been used in astronomical research since the time of their invention in the early 17th century. Many types have been constructed over the years depending on the optical technology, such as refracting and reflecting, the nature of the light or object being imaged, and even where they are placed, such as space telescopes. Some are classified by the task they perform such as solar telescopes.

===Large reflectors===
Nearly all large research-grade astronomical telescopes are reflectors. Some reasons are:
* In a lens the entire volume of material has to be free of imperfection and inhomogeneities, whereas in a mirror, only one surface has to be perfectly polished.
* Light of different colors travels through a medium other than vacuum at different speeds. This causes chromatic aberration.
* Reflectors work in a wider spectrum of light since certain wavelengths are absorbed when passing through glass elements like those found in a refractor or catadioptric.
* There are technical difficulties involved in manufacturing and manipulating large-diameter lenses. One of them is that all real materials sag in gravity. A lens can only be held by its perimeter. A mirror, on the other hand, can be supported by the whole side opposite to its reflecting face.

Most large research reflectors operate at different focal planes, depending on the type and size of the instrument being used. These including the prime focus of the main mirror, the cassegrain focus (light bounced back down behind the primary mirror), and even external to the telescope all together (such as the Nasmyth and coudé focus).

A new era of telescope making was inaugurated by the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT), with a mirror composed of six segments synthesizing a mirror of 4.5 meters diameter. This has now been replaced by a single 6.5 m mirror. Its example was followed by the Keck telescopes with 10 m segmented mirrors.

The largest current ground-based telescopes have a primary mirror of between 6 and 11 meters in diameter. In this generation of telescopes, the mirror is usually very thin, and is kept in an optimal shape by an array of actuators (see active optics). This technology has driven new designs for future telescopes with diameters of 30, 50 and even 100 meters.

Relatively cheap, mass-produced ~2 meter telescopes have recently been developed and have made a significant impact on astronomy research. These allow many astronomical targets to be monitored continuously, and for large areas of sky to be surveyed. Many are robotic telescopes, computer controlled over the internet (see &quot;e.g.&quot; the Liverpool Telescope and the Faulkes Telescope North and South), allowing automated follow-up of astronomical events.

Initially the detector used in telescopes was the human eye. Later, the sensitized photographic plate took its place, and the spectrograph was introduced, allowing the gathering of spectral information. After the photographic plate, successive generations of electronic detectors, such as the charge-coupled device (CCDs), have been perfected, each with more sensitivity and resolution, and often with a wider wavelength coverage.

Current research telescopes have several instruments to choose from such as:
* imagers, of different spectral responses
* spectrographs, useful in different regions of the spectrum
* polarimeters, that detect light polarization.

The phenomenon of optical diffraction sets a limit to the resolution and image quality that a telescope can achieve, which is the effective area of the Airy disc, which limits how close two such discs can be placed. This absolute limit is called the diffraction limit (and may be approximated by the Rayleigh criterion, Dawes limit or Sparrow&#x27;s resolution limit). This limit depends on the wavelength of the studied light (so that the limit for red light comes much earlier than the limit for blue light) and on the diameter of the telescope mirror. This means that a telescope with a certain mirror diameter can theoretically resolve up to a certain limit at a certain wavelength. For conventional telescopes on Earth, the diffraction limit is not relevant for telescopes bigger than about 10 cm. Instead, the seeing, or blur caused by the atmosphere, sets the resolution limit. But in space, or if adaptive optics are used, then reaching the diffraction limit is sometimes possible. At this point, if greater resolution is needed at that wavelength, a wider mirror has to be built or aperture synthesis performed using an array of nearby telescopes.

In recent years, a number of technologies to overcome the distortions caused by atmosphere on ground-based telescopes have been developed, with good results. See adaptive optics, speckle imaging and optical interferometry.
