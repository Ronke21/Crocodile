<text>Ripon () is a city in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 7,863 at the 2020 census. The city is surrounded by the Town of Ripon.

Ripon is home to the Little White Schoolhouse, the commonly recognized birthplace of the Republican Party.

==History==

===Founding===
Ripon was founded in 1849 by David P. Mapes, a former New York steamboat captain. Within two years the city had absorbed the nearby commune of Ceresco, established in 1844 by the Wisconsin Phalanx, a group of settlers inspired by the communitarian socialist philosophy of Charles Fourier. Mapes was a founder of Ripon College, originally incorporated as Brockway College in 1851.

The city was named for the English cathedral city of Ripon, North Yorkshire, by John S. Horner, one of the community&#x27;s original settlers, because that was where his immigrant ancestors originated. Horner also named most of the streets. His house is still standing today.

===Birthplace of the Republican Party===

Meeting at a school house in Ripon on March 20, 1854, some 30 opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act called for the organization of a new political party (to link their cause with the Declaration of Independence). The group also took a leading role in the creation of the Republican Party in many northern states during the summer of 1854. While conservatives and many moderates were content merely to call for the restoration of the Missouri Compromise or a prohibition of slavery extension, the group insisted that no further political compromise with slavery was possible.

The February 1854 meeting was the first political meeting of the group that would become the Republican Party. The modern Ripon Society, a Republican think tank, takes its name from Ripon, Wisconsin.

Jackson, Michigan, also claims to be the true birthplace of the Republican Party.

==Geography==
Ripon is located in the northwest corner of Fond du Lac County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Ripon lies in the Sinnipee Group, a geologic formation composed primarily of dolomite, with limestone as a secondary rock type. Ripon&#x27;s bedrock is primarily limestone. The limestone indicates that Ripon&#x27;s location was once a shallow sea. Since Ripon is on the Sinnipee Group, it is a Karst environment. Ripon also lies in an area that was affected by several glaciation periods. The area has relatively gentle relief and is part of the Fox River (Wisconsin) watershed.

Wis 26 heads north to Oshkosh and south to Waupun, and is designated as an alternate route for Interstate 41. The junction of 23 and 26 was formerly controlled by stop signs, which caused long backups at peak traffic times but now has a traffic signal.

Rosendale has a reputation of being a speed trap with a police department that heavily enforces traffic laws.

<text>Crandon is a city in Forest County, Wisconsin, United States; it is in the northeastern part of the state, about north of Green Bay. The population was 1,713 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Forest County and is the only incorporated community in the county. The city is located adjacent to the Town of Crandon.

==History==
Samuel Shaw, an entrepreneur and capitalist, bought property in the area of Forest County in the 1880s, formerly Oconto County. With the aide of Major Frank P. Crandon, tax commissioner with the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, he successfully lobbied the Wisconsin Legislature for the creation of Forest County, which was established in 1887. Because of his help, Frank Crandon became the namesake for the county seat. Rail service arrived shortly thereafter in the region via the Soo Line Railroad, but a spur line did not directly reach the town until the turn of the 20th century.

The lumber industry defined the early growth of the city. In 1891, Page and Landeck Lumber Company purchased a tract of hardwood timberlands near Crandon, and by 1902, the company built a huge sawmill (later named the Keith &amp; Hiles Lumber Mill) near Clear Lake on Crandon&#x27;s north side. The population of Crandon grew from 800 to more than 2,400 in just a few years. With the rail line&#x27;s presence, settlers and loggers from Kentucky were recruited for the bustling timber industry of northern Wisconsin. The company&#x27;s sawmill eventually was moved to Crandon from Glasgow, Kentucky. Modern culture lore reflects the early &quot;Kentuck&quot; ancestors. The city was officially incorporated as Crandon in 1909 after construction of the county courthouse began, and much of the town&#x27;s building stock was constructed during this time. Though timber has diminished as a prominent industry in the north-central United States, logging companies still operate in the nearby Nicolet National Forest.

From the 1980s to 2003, Crandon was the center of an environmental debate to construct a mining operation at the proposed Crandon mine, a rich copper deposit discovered by the Exxon Coal and Minerals Company. The heated discussion led to a Wisconsin Legislature mining moratorium act in 1998. Eventually, the proposed company and mine site lands were purchased by the opposed Mole Lake Sakaogon Chippewa and Forest County Potawatomi tribes, whose reservations sat near the site. The project was withdrawn in October 2003.

On October 7, 2007, Crandon drew the attention of national and world media when Tyler Peterson, an employee of the Forest County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and a part-time officer for the Crandon Police Department, shot seven people, wounding one and killing six in the town. They ranged in age from 14 to 20.

On July 29, 2014, Crandon voters recalled their mayor by roughly a 2–1 margin.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.19 square miles (16.03 km2), of which 5.22 square miles (13.52 km2) is land and 0.97 square miles (2.5 km2) is water. The city lies on the northern shore of Metonga Lake. Lake Lucerne is also only a few miles from the city. There is a large crater in the town&#x27;s park, Culversinesis Park, caused by a large dairy truck accident in 1962.

<text>Cassville is a village in Grant County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 777 at the 2020 census. The village is located along the Mississippi River, opposite from the mouth of the Turkey River. It is surrounded by the Town of Cassville.

== Etymology ==
The village was named after Lewis Cass, the governor of Michigan Territory from 1813 to 1831. The name has been used by the community since at least 1828, when the post office was established by Allen Hill.

== History ==
The site of Cassville was occupied by the Meskwaki people before European settlement. In 1820, Henry Schoolcraft observed a Meskwaki village consisting of twelve substantial log lodges and cultivated fields in the locality.

The Euro-American settlement of Cassville began in 1827, when Judge John Sawyer of Illinois established a smelting furnace to serve lead miners who were expanding northward from Galena, Illinois. The town attracted sixty to seventy people in its first year. By the early 1830s, Cassville held several log cabins, a tavern, a general store, and a blockhouse constructed during the Black Hawk War.

Cassville experienced a brief boom in 1836, when real estate speculators incorrectly bet that the river landing would become the capital city of the newly established Wisconsin Territory. A group of investors from Albany, New York, doing business as Daniels, Denniston &amp; Co., purchased most of the town site. They also financed the construction of the Denniston House, a substantial brick lodging house reputed to cost $45,000 in 1836. Cassville&#x27;s failure to become capital, combined with the Panic of 1837, caused an abrupt halt in the town&#x27;s growth, and much of the land was locked in legal disputes for the following decade.

Nelson Dewey settled in Cassville in 1836 as a clerk for Daniels, Denniston &amp; Co. He later became first Governor of Wisconsin from 1848-1852. Following his term as governor, Dewey invested in the completion of the Denniston House as a hotel in the 1850s and promoted Cassville&#x27;s development, albeit with only limited success. Dewey established his personal estate, Stonefield, on the north side of Cassville in the 1860s. The estate grounds later became Nelson Dewey State Park, and in 1953 the Wisconsin Historical Society established Stonefield Historic Site at Dewey&#x27;s former mansion.

The Grant County part of the village is adjacent to the Town of Muscoda and the Iowa County part is adjacent to the Town of Pulaski.

==History and culture==
Explorer and historian William Pidgeon, who visited the area in 1840, reported that Muscoda was &quot;the ancient location of a large Indian village, but at present occupied by a few white families. This village is situated on an extensive plain of sandy soil, on the surface of which may be seen relics of many an ancient mound, varying much in size and form; some resembling redoubts, or fortifications, others presenting the forms of gigantic men, beasts, birds, and reptiles, among which may be found the eagle, the otter, the serpent, the alligator, and others pertaining to the deer, elk, and buffalo species. The highland in the vicinity of this village abounds with monuments that bear testimony to the ancient existence of an immense population in those regions.&quot;

Muscoda became known as English Prairie, named for two English fur traders, Abraham Lansing and Garrit Roseboom, who opened a post at the close of the French and Indian War. Lansing and his son were murdered in 1763 by their French assistants and the fame of the murder kept the name English Prairie alive until 1840.

The word Muscoda (pronounced &quot;MUS-co-day&quot;) may be a corruption of the Ojibwa (Chippewa) word &quot;mashkode&quot;, meaning &quot;prairie&quot;. It may also have been taken from Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, in which it is mentioned several times. The word&#x27;s popular meaning was &quot;Prairie of Flowers&quot;.

Muscoda has billed itself as the &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s Morel Capital&quot; since 1982 and hosts the &quot;Morel Mushroom Festival&quot; every year on the weekend following Mother&#x27;s Day. The event includes carnival rides, tractors pulls, tournaments, merchant stands, food booths, and portable tattoo parlors.

<text>Platteville is the largest city in Grant County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 11,836 at the 2020 census.

Platteville is located atop the greater Platte River valley in the southern Driftless Region of Wisconsin, an area known for its karst topography and rolling hills. It is home to the University of Wisconsin–Platteville. It is the principal city of the Platteville micropolitan statistical area, which has an estimated population of 51,938. 

==History==
Platteville was settled by pioneers and early lead miners; along inlets and flat groves of The Rountree Branch and Little Platte River. Part of the Platte River shed; these rivers flow into the greater Upper Mississippi River system. More specifically located in the Driftless Region of Southwestern Wisconsin.

Due to its geographic location; areas of town are carved by ridges, narrow valleys, and steep hills. The influence of geography can also be seen in the irregularity of the streets in the community. As the town grew, roads were given odd routes, to avoid the steep ravines and mining shafts strewn about the locality.

Platteville was officially founded in 1829 by John H. Rountree, a southern businessman who had arrived in hopes of finding wealth during the areas lead rush. The town became a flourishing mining community in part due to its close proximity to Dubuque, Iowa, and Galena, Illinois. Both were thriving cities along the Mississippi River trade route that benefited from the rising demand for lead throughout the United States from the 1820s–1850s.

John H. Rountree and other wealthy southerners in the area, such as Wisconsin’s First Governor Henry Dodge; brought slaves with them during the lead rush. They also brought freed black laborers, with intentions for them to work the mines at a more affordable cost, often nothing. Although unpaid labor was illegal, it was practiced in the region until after the Civil War.

In 1850, a freed African-American man from Virginia, named Charles Shepard, settled a community known as Pleasant Ridge, Grant County, Wisconsin just west of Platteville. This served as a safe haven for many black people coming up the Mississippi River from Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, etc. Some stayed and raised families but most continued on their way in hopes of finding success elsewhere.

By the 1860s lead ore production was decreasing. However, the mining of zinc ore quickly filled the void for prospective work. Platteville had become an established town, complete with schools, a private preparatory academy, newspaper, several churches, and a telegraph service as of November 1849.

During this time, both a teachers&#x27; college and a mining college were founded. The normal school was established on October 9, 1866 to train teachers for elementary school grades. The Wisconsin Mining Trade School opened in January 1908.

In 1959, these two colleges were merged to become Wisconsin State College and Institute of Technology. Its curriculum was developed to add graduate programs and departments, particularly in engineering. In 1971 it was renamed as University of Wisconsin–Platteville, to reflect its expanded programs in graduate study. Other additions included criminal justice and, in the early 21st century, UW Platteville is also considered to have the best criminal justice college in the Midwest.

From 1984 until 2001 the Chicago Bears football team held summer training camp on the campus of University of Wisconsin–Platteville. Their program resulted in a substantial infusion of money into the local economy each summer. The town felt the decline after the Bears moved their training camp to Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois.

In 2004, U.S. Highway 151 was upgraded to a limited-access highway; it bypassed the city south of Platteville. Prior to the upgrade, the highway exits were closer to Platteville. The city made changes to adjust to the new southern US 151 bypass, and it has influenced subsequent development. A new hospital was built just north of US 151 and next to its off ramps. A Walmart Supercenter and a Menards have opened near the northern end of the US 151 bypass.

==Arts and culture==

The Mining and Rollo Jamison Museums examines Platteville&#x27;s mining history.

Built in 1837 by Reverend Samuel Mitchell, the Stone Cottage still contains many of the original furnishings. The home was a home of the Major John Rountree, one of Platteville&#x27;s founders. The walls are two feet thick and made of dolomite Galena limestone.

The Platte Mound M is the letter &quot;M&quot; written using whitewashed stones on Platte Mound about four miles east of downtown Platteville. It is the largest hillside letter &quot;M&quot; in the world. The letter is high, wide, with legs wide.

==Education==

The Platteville School District serves the Platteville area. Platteville High School is the area&#x27;s public high school. Platteville High School&#x27;s mascot is &quot;Henry Hillmen&quot;. The University of Wisconsin–Platteville is located in Platteville.

==Transportation==
Aside from Platteville Municipal Airport (KPVB), which serves the city and surrounding communities for general aviation, Platteville has minimal commercial air access. The closest airport with any regularly-scheduled commercial service is Dubuque Regional Airport, and the closest airport with regularly-scheduled commercial international flights is Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

Platteville&#x27;s primary road access is via U.S. Route 151, which acts as an expressway for the region; US 151 has three exits near the city center. Wisconsin state routes 80 and 81 also serve Platteville, cutting through the central business district as sort of a &quot;main street&quot;.

Platteville Public Transportation provides the community with bus service and paratransit service.

Platteville no longer has railroad service. It was previously served by the Chicago and Northwestern Railway (C&amp;NW) via an 8-mile branch off the Montfort Junction to Galena line at Ipswich. The line entered Platteville from the east-southeast and curved around to the north. The line then joined the Milwaukee Road. This in effect created a large 180° curve in the southeastern part of Platteville where the mines, depots and other rail-dependent industries were located. The Milwaukee Road branch continued on to the ENE then east for 17 miles where it branched off another Milwaukee Road branch line to Mineral Point at the town of Calamine. Passenger service ended on the C&amp;NW in 1951 and was replaced by mixed train service on the Milwaukee Road in 1952. Freight service continued on the Milwaukee Road until 1974 when the line was abandoned and pulled up. It left the C&amp;NW moving only a few cars per week which applied to abandon the route. The abandonment was granted in 1980 and the line was pulled up forever ending railroad service to Platteville.

<text>Potosi is a village in Grant County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 646 at the 2020 census. The village is in the Town of Potosi.

==History==
Potosi is located where Wisconsin&#x27;s lead ore belt intersects with the Mississippi. The post office (1837 to present) was originally located between Van Buren and Head of the Hollow, then at Van Buren, then at La Fayette. In 1839, the leaders of three settlements (Snake Hollow, sometimes called Head of the Hollow, Van Buren, and La Fayette) decided to combine the villages. The new, larger community was named Potosi, and the post office moved one last time, to the center of the new, merged community.

There are several explanations for the origin of the name Potosi, but the correct one is unknown. Many mining towns are named Potosi, ultimately derived from the fabled silver mines of Potosí, Bolivia. Another explanation is that Potosi was named for Potosi, Missouri, where a lot of the early lead miners originated. Another explanation is that Potosi is a corruption of &quot;Potosa,&quot; the supposed name of the wife of Julien Dubuque, an early settler in the area. No evidence exists for this theory.

Known as the &quot;Catfish Capital of Wisconsin,&quot; the village holds an annual Catfish Festival and Fireman&#x27;s Fish Fry, typically on the second weekend of August. The event includes a truck and tractor pull, beanbag and a euchre tournament, fireworks, live music, a parade, and the fish fry.

The museum features historic beer and brewing memorabilia, including signs, advertisements, bottles, cans, and miscellaneous paraphernalia.

Local road signs herald Potosi&#x27;s Main Street as &quot;the longest Main Street in the world.&quot; A newspaper article traces the claim to a 1950s item in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It Or Not!&quot; which made the more qualified statement that it is the longest Main Street &quot;without a cross street.&quot; Current maps show a three-mile stretch, with numerous streets—including one named &quot;Cross Street&quot;—that drain into it and end, forming T-shaped intersections, but no street that continues across it. The stretch is divided into two portions each with a distinct street name: North Main Street and South Main Street.

The Potosi Badger Huts Site, remnants of the region&#x27;s lead mining history, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and accessible by trail.

<text>New Glarus is a village in Green County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,266 at the 2020 census. It was founded in 1845 by immigrants from the canton of Glarus in eastern Switzerland, from which the village takes its name. It is located at the intersection of Wisconsin Highways 69 and 39 within the Madison metropolitan area.

==History==

===Settlement===

In the early 1840s, after several years of failed crops and as food became scarce, much of the canton of Glarus in Switzerland found itself deep in poverty. With more workers than available jobs, the government of the canton saw emigration to America as a solution. Authorities established the Glarus Emigration Society in 1844, which offered loans to help residents purchase land in the New World. All other expenses associated with the voyage to America were to be paid by the emigrants themselves. Men were offered free of rent for ten years, after which they could own the land for a mere ten shillings per acre. Given the desperate economic conditions in Switzerland, 193 volunteers decided to leave their homeland to start anew in America.

In 1845, magistrates in Glarus dispatched two men, Nicolas Duerst and Fridolin Streiff, to find a suitable location for a colony in the New World. They were given $2600 and instructions to purchase land, build cabins, and prepare for the settlers to arrive the following spring.

Duerst and Streiff began their search in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois before reaching St. Louis, Missouri. In the early days of July 1845, they then traveled north to Galena, Illinois, after which they arrived at the land office in Mineral Point, Wisconsin. The men investigated several tracts of farm and timber land in the southern Wisconsin territory before deciding on two square miles along the Little Sugar River. On July 17, 1845, they purchased for $1.25 per acre. It was a fertile basin bounded with hills and a large stand of trees nearby. Some said later it was not the best property available, but the valley and hilltops reminded them of their native Switzerland.

The land that would become the Village of New Glarus was untamed wilderness, which had been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries. An Indian trail passed just south of present-day New Glarus, through what is now New Glarus Woods State Park. That trail later became the main thoroughfare to and from New Glarus. Even as late as 1845 the remnants of an old wigwam were still found near there.

Anxious to begin a fresh life in the New World, families in Switzerland decided to depart much earlier than expected. On April 10, 1845, the group left Glarus on a barge bound for Rotterdam. From there they expected to sail into New York City where friends were scheduled to meet them. Dishonest agents, however, routed them to Baltimore, Maryland, where they first set foot in America after a 49-day voyage. Without any knowledge of the whereabouts of Duerst and Streiff, the former residents of Glarus left Baltimore searching for the two men who arrived before them and the land chosen for their new home.

During their journey across America, the Swiss pioneers heard rumors that Duerst and Streiff had died. Undaunted, the group continued their difficult journey west. When they arrived in St. Louis, it was said that the settlers were covered with mosquito bites and very nearly approaching starvation. From St. Louis they then boarded a steamboat for Galena, Illinois.

Shortly after arriving in Galena, the settlers from Switzerland were excited to learn Duerst and Streiff were alive and had already secured land for their new settlement. Overjoyed, 18 men left that night on foot and walked to the location of the settlement. Wagons were then dispatched back to Galena for the remainder of the immigrants still there. After a long journey that took four months and five days, 108 settlers arrived at their new home on August 15, 1845. Three members of their party died on the way to southern Wisconsin. The balance found work or friends along the way; many more joined the colony later the following year.

===Early years===

In all, the New Glarus settlers purchased for their new home. Many of the pioneers were carpenters, mechanics, and farmers; trades that proved useful as the settlers prepared for their first winter in the Wisconsin Territory. A sum of $1,000 was used by the settlers that winter to purchase tools, cattle, seed, and other provisions, all of which had to be repaid with the price of the land within ten years of the formation of the colony. Twelve families stayed in the community&#x27;s only wooden hut that first winter, which was built on the same property where the Swiss United Church of Christ is presently located. Their diet consisted mainly of potatoes and grated cheese, a dish also known as Röschti. They also ate fish caught from the Little Sugar River. Bread, it was said, was a rarity, and meat even more so. To earn money to survive their first winter, the settlers worked in the nearby lead mines in Exeter and Mineral Point. In 1851 the first store in New Glarus opened, followed in 1853 by the first hotel, and in 1870 by the first cheese factory.

Two years after New Glarus was founded, another group of immigrants arrived from &quot;Old Glarus.&quot; Then, one by one, more arrived, and the population of New Glarus was reinforced by new settlers from their motherland. The 1870 census showed 1,247 natives of Switzerland living in Green County, Wisconsin. By 1878 the 22 original parcels owned by the first settlers had grown to more than around New Glarus.

Eventually, every Swiss franc loaned to the settlers was returned to their former home in Switzerland with interest. Then in 1861 a terrible fire devastated much of the town of Glarus, the capital of the Swiss canton from which the settlers had originated. The fire destroyed 593 buildings while over 3,000 people lost their roofs and everything they owned. To aid their former countrymen back in their native homeland, the residents of New Glarus collected and dispatched more money than what they received in the form of a loan from Glarus 16 years earlier. In 1881, when much of the town of Elm, also in the canton of Glarus, was buried in the great Rockslide of Elm killing 114 people, the residents of New Glarus rushed to help again: this time sending $20,000 back to the old country.

Though they had only been residents in America a very short time, 98 Glarners fought for the Union during the American Civil War. The residents of tiny New Glarus contributed to other American wars, too. The Swiss Miss Textile Mart and Lace Factory in New Glarus made chevrons and insignia for U.S. military uniforms during World War II. Walter Gabriel Schindler, who was born in New Glarus, fought in that same war and received the Navy Cross and Silver Star. Kevin Patrick Lynch from New Glarus also received the Navy Cross in World War II. In 2001, Henry Janisch, a native of New Glarus, became &quot;one of the first Marine(s) off the first helicopter&quot; in the opening moments of the War in Afghanistan.

===Agriculture===

After their first winter in the New World, the residents of New Glarus purchased cattle from Ohio at $12 a head. This stock was the birth of dairy farming and cheese making in New Glarus, a trade many had learned from their fathers and forefathers in Switzerland. Soon the herds of dairy cows in and around New Glarus swelled and dairy products proved lucrative.

Nickolaus Gerber, who moved from New York, started the first cheese factories in New Glarus, beginning with the area&#x27;s first Limburger cheese factory four miles (6 km) southwest of New Glarus. He later built America&#x27;s first Swiss cheese (also known as Emmental in Switzerland) factory on the Dietrich Freitag farm outside of New Glarus in Washington township.

Following the end of the Civil War, and with the evolution of the cheese production, the prosperity of New Glarus and neighboring communities grew. At its peak in 1905, New Glarus boasted 22 cheese factories; so many it was said the crossroads of the town were congested with daily deliveries of milk to the Limburger and Swiss cheese factories. New Glarus quickly became known as the &quot;Cheese Capital of the World.&quot; Today only one Limburger cheese factory remains near New Glarus; the last of its kind in all of North America. Despite declining popularity of Limburger cheese, the area around New Glarus still boasts the largest concentration of specialty cheese factories and award-winning cheesemakers anywhere in the United States.

In 1910 Helvetia Milk Condensing Company, of Highland, Illinois, opened a factory in New Glarus to make sweetened condensed milk. It quickly became the village&#x27;s largest employer. It bought large quantities of milk from farms in the area, and as a result, most of the local cheese factories closed. In 1923, the Helvetia Milk Condensing was renamed the Pet Milk Company. In 1962 Pet Milk Company closed its condensing plant in New Glarus, forever changing the fabric of the small town. Agricultural-based businesses, once integral to the New Glarus economy, disappeared. Cheese factories, farm equipment dealerships, feed mills, hardware stores, and other businesses that profited from local agribusiness were soon gone. But the plant&#x27;s closure also spurred the development of tourism as a new source of income for New Glarus, as it promoted the village&#x27;s ethnic history as a Swiss colony.

===Development of tourism===

In the years leading up to World War II, an economic crisis affected much of the agriculture and dairy industry in New Glarus. Many residents left the community to look for work elsewhere and leaders became concerned about the future of their small Swiss community. Representatives of the village consulted with the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the Swiss American Historical Society to find a solution. It was decided that tourism could help resurrect the local economy and preserve its identity. Local businesses began changing the way they did business, actively promoting the heritage of New Glarus. Swiss chalet-style architecture began appearing throughout the village and festivals, once intended for local consumption, became frequented by tourists from throughout the upper Midwest. By 1999, the village municipal code was amended to require Swiss architecture to new construction and renovation.

Arnold Wieser, owner of the Swiss Miss Textile Mart and Lace Factory, became a &quot;de facto&quot; ambassador for New Glarus. As he traveled through the Midwest peddling his embroidery and Swiss lace at festivals and fairs, Wieser actively marketed the community and its Swiss heritage.

Roger Bright, whose polka band played in 33 states, Canada, and Europe, also became an ambassador for New Glarus. Bright&#x27;s Cleveland-style polka included a Swiss influence and wherever he played he promoted New Glarus. Bright&#x27;s music was recorded on 35 albums, including hit songs such as &quot;Everywhere You Go&quot; and &quot;Come to the Mountain.&quot; When not on the road, the band was a fixture at the New Glarus Hotel on most weekends. In the early 1970s Bright played on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; with the Emmy Award-winning Frankie Yankovic. He also appeared on the &quot;Phil Donahue Show&quot; and performed with the St. Louis Pops Orchestra.

===Historical events===
* In 1887, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Minneapolis Railroad, often referred to as the Milwaukee Road, extended its railroad line to New Glarus, which provided passenger and freight service to the rest of the country. Over time it became one of the railroad’s most profitable lines due to its many milk and cheese shipments. Dubbed the Limburger Express, the line remained open until March 30, 1972, when the Limburger Express made its final run ending 85 years of service to New Glarus. Today 24 miles of the abandoned railroad line from New Glarus to Brodhead, Wisconsin has become the Sugar River State Trail, which is enjoyed by bicycle, snowmobile, and outdoor enthusiasts. And the former railroad depot in New Glarus, the Chicago, Milwaukee and Saint Paul Railroad Depot was restored and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
* In 1905, a proposal was presented to the people of New Glarus that Limburger cheese be &quot;declared legal tender for the payment of all debts and a medium of exchange throughout the district.&quot;
* Joseph W. Weinberg, a physicist who worked for the University of Minnesota and son-in-law of former New Glarus mayor Gilbert P. Hoesly, was accused of passing wartime atomic secrets to Steve Nelson, a Croatian-born American Communist leader. Weinberg, dubbed &quot;Scientist X,&quot; was closely shadowed by 10 government counterespionage agents when he and his wife visited New Glarus in 1945 and was later subpoenaed by the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee in 1948.
* Senator John F. Kennedy campaigned in New Glarus before the Wisconsin Presidential primary election on April 1, 1960.
* In 1968, three Amish farmers—Jonas Yoder, Wallace Miller and Adin Yutzy—refused to enroll their 14 and 15-year-old children at New Glarus High School. They were fined $5 each for violating Wisconsin&#x27;s compulsory-school-attendance law. It became the basis of &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;, in which the United States Supreme Court in 1972 found that compulsory education past eighth grade did not apply to Amish children, as it violated their fundamental right to freedom of religion.
* Deb Carey, founder and president of New Glarus Brewing Company, was a guest of President Barack Obama in the first lady’s box at his State of the Union address before the United States Congress on February 12, 2013, in Washington, D.C.
* The New Glarus High School boys&#x27; basketball team won the Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association (WIAA) Division 4 boys&#x27; basketball championship game in Madison, Wisconsin, on March 16, 2019. It was the school&#x27;s first state championship in any sport and its first visit to the boys&#x27; basketball state tournament since 1932.

It is primarily spoken by older inhabitants of the area and is rarely heard on a daily basis anymore.

A recording to the dialect in archived form is available from the Max-Kade Institute for German-American Studies.

The brewery grew quickly and in 2004 the company broke ground on a new 75,000 sq. ft., $21 million brewery to handle increased demand for its product. The brewery has expanded repeatedly since then and now its facility is over 115,000 sq. ft.; it is expanding again in 2023. Despite selling its beer exclusively in Wisconsin, New Glarus Brewing Company is the 12th largest craft brewer and 22nd largest overall brewing company in the United States.

===Swiss Center of North America===
In 1999, New Glarus was chosen as the home of the Swiss Center of North America, a cultural center dedicated to the preservation and celebration of Swiss culture. Chicago, New York, and Toronto were also considered, but New Glarus was ultimately chosen because of its central location and the large concentration of Swiss Americans in the vicinity.

The Swiss Center includes a research library, historical archive, exhibits, conference rooms, and offices. $3 million was pledged, with a majority of the funds coming from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, State of Wisconsin, Canton of Glarus, and corporations, including General Casualty Insurance, Nestle USA, Novartis, Phillip Morris Europe, and Victorinox.

==Transportation==
Completed in 1887, a railroad to New Glarus was constructed on the Brodhead-New Glarus branch of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. The route was nicknamed &quot;The Limburger Special.&quot; Service to and from New Glarus ceased in 1972, ten years after the Pet Milk plant in the village closed, which provided most of the freight carried on the rail line. Shortly after the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources announced the purchase of the 276-acre, 22.78-mile right-of-way for $74,000. It later became the Sugar River State Trail. The New Glarus station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Arts and culture==
The village of New Glarus is a popular tourist destination best known for its Swiss heritage, old world architecture, ethnic dining, small independently owned craft brewery, and outdoor festivals.

More than 160 years after it was founded, New Glarus has maintained much of its Swiss heritage and old world traditions. Swiss-style chalets and flower boxes filled with red geraniums grace the streets of the village and Swiss flags fly next to the American flag at many businesses and homes. Old World meat markets, restaurants, and a Swiss bakery are also found in downtown New Glarus, along with folk art, museums, and Swiss-style shops. Many Swiss customs are still alive in New Glarus, including the card game Jass, yodeling, and flag tossing. Today New Glarus is the best known Swiss settlement in America.

===Food and dining===

Despite its small size, New Glarus is known for many traditional Swiss dishes, including specialties rarely seen outside of Switzerland. Foods served in New Glarus include:

* Röschti (or Rösti) – Considered the national dish of Switzerland, it is also a favorite dish in New Glarus. A meal eaten by the early Swiss settlers after first arriving in the New World, Röschti is made with grated potatoes, onions, Swiss cheese, and fresh herbs. Röschti is fried and shaped into rounds or patties. Originally served as a breakfast dish, it is now commonly available as a side dish at most restaurants in New Glarus.
* Kalberwurst – A sausage with a distinctive, creamy flavor that originated in the Canton of Glarus, kalberwurst is made with veal, milk, ground crackers, and mild spices. It has a smooth texture and mild taste, and although most sausages are smoked, kalberwurst is not. It is often cooked with onions and gravy. Many Swiss restaurants in New Glarus serve kalberwurst and it is also a featured dish at the community&#x27;s annual Kilby Supper.
* Spaetzli (or Spätzle) – Spaetzli are small, boiled and fried dumplings made with eggs, flour, and salt. Roughly translated, &quot;spaetzli&quot; means &quot;small sparrows,&quot; which refers to the dumpling&#x27;s small shape and size.
* Landjaeger (or Landjäger) – A dried sausage made with beef, pork, lard, sugar, and spices, landjaegers are often eaten as snacks. Pressed into a mold, which gives them a distinctive rectangular shape, landjaegers were sent to soldiers from New Glarus fighting in Europe during World War II because they could be kept without refrigeration. The word &quot;Landjaeger&quot; means &quot;gamekeeper&quot;. The popularity of the sausage has increased over the years and is now sold at most grocery stores, convenience stores, and taverns throughout southern Wisconsin.
* Braetzeli – A braetzeli is a wafer-thin cookie with an almond-vanilla taste. Handmade braetzelis are extremely difficult and time-consuming to make. They are cooked on a special Swiss iron, which imprints a decorative pattern on both sides of the cookie.

Other examples of Swiss cuisine commonly available in New Glarus include bratwurst, fondue, Älplermagronen (Alpine macaroni), Zopf, chaeschuechli, schnitzel, chocolates, and Swiss Stollen.

<text>Dodgeville is a city in and the county seat of Iowa County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,984 at the 2020 census, making it the county&#x27;s most populous city. Dodgeville is part of the Madison metropolitan area.

==History==

In 1827, Henry Dodge, his family, and about 40 miners began what would become the city of Dodgeville. Dodge made a pact with the local Winnebago Indian leaders so he could build a cabin and smelter. The original community had three settlements: &quot;Dodgeville&quot;, &quot;Dirty Hollow&quot; and &quot;Minersville&quot;. A fourth settlement, Moon Spring, near the intersection of the present Highway 18 bypass and Bennett Road flourished until the cholera epidemic in the early 1850s.

Dodgeville, which was named after Dodge, grew slowly during its early years. It was incorporated as a village in the 1840s. Later a small &quot;war&quot; was fought with Mineral Point over which community would become the seat of Iowa County after Lafayette County was created. At the time, Mineral Point was the seat, because it was centrally located in the &#x27;old&#x27; Iowa County that stretched from the Wisconsin River in the north south to the Illinois border.

The County seat eventually moved to Dodgeville because of its central location in the &#x27;new&#x27; Iowa County. Dodgeville&#x27;s population grew rapidly, and it became a center for mining and later, dairy product manufacturing and shipping. Miners from England flooded the city, and British and Cornish architecture is still visible in the city today. Dodgeville became the largest city in Wisconsin at the time as well as most of the Midwest north of St. Louis, and west of Cincinnati. The community&#x27;s boom didn&#x27;t last long though, and with the decline of mining its population was overtaken by rapidly growing cities like Chicago and Milwaukee.

Several factors led to the decline in importance of mining, including the Black Hawk War, the California Gold Rush, the Civil War, and the emergence of farming, leading to Dodgeville&#x27;s development as a business and agricultural center. Today the city is most commonly known for being the headquarters for the apparel company Lands&#x27; End.

===Historical sites===

The Iowa County Courthouse was dedicated in 1859 and continues to serve as the seat of government in Iowa County, functioning as the oldest courthouse in the state. Several additions to the building have been added over the years, in keeping with the historic and classic architectural style of the original structure.

The Dodge Mining Camp Cabin, originally built circa 1828, is representative of the housing constructed by lead diggers at &quot;Dodge&#x27;s Camp&quot; - the original lead mining claim of Colonel Henry Dodge and family. The Iowa County Historical Society restored the cabin and moved it to its present location on Fountain Street. It is one of Wisconsin&#x27;s oldest structures and may be the last extant mining camp cabin from the days of the &quot;Lead Rush&quot; of 1827–1830.

Spang&#x27;s Opera House was built in the early stages of Dodgeville&#x27;s development. It was demolished during the 1990s to build a convenience store at the intersections of Highway 23—Bequette, North and Spring Streets. The structure&#x27;s foundation walls were among the oldest stone structures in Dodgeville, dating from the 1840s. In the 1940s the lower level of the opera house was the first location of the Iowa County Dairy Cooperative, before the coop built a structure near the intersection of Hwy. 191 and Section Line Road on the east side of Dodgeville. At one time the Opera House was in the center of a thriving business area, with several hotels in the immediate vicinity: The Cocking Hotel, the Wisconsin House, and the Western Hotel, all on North Main Street. Today, only the Western Hotel survives, and is now rental units.

Begun in 1928, construction was completed on the Dodgeville Masonic Temple in 1930, with the building dedicated on May 13 of that year. This structure is among the last Masonic Temples built in Wisconsin that is still functioning as a Masonic Lodge. Dodgeville Lodge #119 dates to 1859. Today, the structure also houses a Masonic Museum for the Southwestern Wisconsin region. The Dodgeville Primitive Methodist Church stood on this site until the present Plymouth Congregational UCC structure was built in 1907.

Downtown Dodgeville&#x27;s historic buildings stretch six blocks along north and south Iowa Street. Much of the downtown is included in the Iowa Street Historic District.

The Jones and Owens family, prominent merchants in Dodgeville constructed a Mausoleum in the East Cemetery on East Division Street where several of the family members are entombed. Family mausoleums were quite common in larger urban areas in the late 19th century, but less common in smaller communities. The Jones and Owens mercantile business building is located on South Iowa Street and currently houses the Quality Bakery (since 1946), among other businesses. The Jones family mansion is located on North Main Street across from Plymouth UCC and the Owens family mansion is located on South Iowa Street near the intersection with Valley Street. Both structures are private dwellings.

Built in 1878, the David J. and Maggie Jones House was originally built for J.C. Hocking and was later purchased by David J. Jones.

==Parks and recreation==
Military Ridge State Trail is a trail that runs from Dodgeville to Fitchburg, Wisconsin following the former Chicago and Northwestern Railroad paths (MRT). It is used for hiking, bicycling, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing. The original military road from Fort Howard in Green Bay to Fort Crawford in Prairie du Chien followed much of the same corridor in the 1820s through the 1840s and was the primary land route crossing the state.

Governor Dodge State Park is located on Highway 23, about north of Dodgeville. The park&#x27;s development began in the late 1940s, followed by the development of Cox Hollow Lake in the 1950s. The park is in the upper reaches of the Twin Parks watershed, a major soil and water conservation project in the area of the Lower Wisconsin River watershed.

==Government==

The foundations for the Iowa County Courthouse located at 222 North Iowa Street were laid in 1859, making it the state&#x27;s oldest continuously active courthouse.

The mayor of Dodgeville is Barry N. Hottmann.

==Education==

The elementary school covers pre-K through 5th grade. The middle school serves grades 6 through 8, and the high school 9 through 12.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School serves students in Kindergarten through 8th grade.

==Transportation==
===Airports===
The Dodgeville Municipal Airport, built in 1967, was originally known as the Governor Dodge Quinn Airport. Closed in 1989, it reopened as the Southwind Airport, a private airport, in 2002.

===Bus service===
The Aging &amp; Disability Resource Center (ADRC) has a special needs van that serves Iowa County. The bus is available on Tuesdays for people wanting to travel around Dodgeville. Residents over the age of 60 or individuals with disabilities may use the Iowa County Aging &amp; Disability Resource Center Volunteer Driver Escort program for non-emergency medical purposes. The Iowa County Taxi serves Dodgeville on Wednesdays and Fridays and Lamers Bus provides transportation from Green Bay to Dubuque, stopping in downtown Dodgeville.

===Highways===
Dodgeville Expressway, U.S. Route 151 (US 151), US 18, and Wisconsin Highway 23 travel through the city.

===Railroads===
Dodgeville no longer has rail service, but was once served by both the Chicago and Northwestern and the Illinois Central Railroads. The former Illinois Central freight depot still stands in downtown Dodgeville. The former C&amp;NW passenger depot was relocated from North Dodgeville to the former Don Q Inn Supper Club and Motel north of Dodgeville in the 1970s. Dodgeville was the northernmost terminus for an Illinois Central line from Freeport, Illinois. The C&amp;NW line extended from Madison to Dodgeville and then to points west and south, with its terminus in Galena. The Illinois Central line to Dodgeville was removed in February 1942 and the rails were used in the construction of the Battleship Wisconsin, which was commissioned during World War II and served into the Vietnam era.

==Healthcare==
In 1974, St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital and Dodgeville General Hospital merged to form Memorial Hospital. In 2001, Memorial Hospital changed its name to Upland Hills Health Center. Later other structures were added to the hospital, which were eventually demolished to build the much larger existing Upland Hills Health Center. The center now comprises a clinic, rehabilitation center, nursing home, and hospital.

<text>Mineral Point is a city in Iowa County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,581 at the 2020 census. The city is located within the Town of Mineral Point. Mineral Point is part of the Madison Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Mineral Point was settled in 1827, becoming a lead and zinc mining center, and commercial town in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It initially drew a considerable number of Cornish-immigrant miners and their families. In the mid-20th century it attracted artists and an artist&#x27;s colony and its tourism industry began to grow. The city&#x27;s well-preserved historical character within the varied natural topography of the driftless area has made it a regional tourist destination. Mineral Point is sometimes called Wisconsin&#x27;s third oldest city, but the Wisconsin Historical Society notes several older colonial settlements.

== History ==
The first European settlement at Mineral Point began in 1827. One of the first settlers to the area was Henry Dodge and his family who settled a few miles away from Mineral Point. During the following year, large quantities of galena, or lead ore, were discovered around the settlement in shallow deposits. Lead had many uses at the time, and settlers began to flock to the region hoping to make a living by extracting the easily accessible mineral. Lead deposits extended throughout an area that also included Dubuque, Iowa and Galena, Illinois, but Mineral Point became the center of lead mining operations within the bounds of present-day Wisconsin (then part of Michigan Territory). By 1829, the region&#x27;s growing population led to the creation of Iowa County, which included all of the lead mining lands within the territory. Mineral Point was established as the county seat later that year. During the Black Hawk War of 1832, residents of Mineral Point built Fort Jackson to protect the town from a possible attack. The young settlement&#x27;s importance was further confirmed in 1834 when it was selected as the site of one of two federal land offices responsible for distributing public land to settlers within the area that now encompasses Wisconsin.

When Wisconsin Territory was created in 1836, Mineral Point hosted the inauguration of the first territorial governor, Henry Dodge, and the territorial secretary, John S. Horner. During the ceremony, a design by Horner was officially recognized as the Great Seal of Wisconsin Territory. It displayed an arm holding a pickaxe over a pile of lead ore, demonstrating the importance of Mineral Point&#x27;s early mining economy to the new territory. A census conducted in the months after the inauguration showed that Iowa County had 5,234 inhabitants, making it the most populous county in the Wisconsin Territory east of the Mississippi River.

Mineral Point remained an important lead mining center during the 1840s. Although the most easily accessible lead deposits on the surface were being exhausted by this time, new immigrants began to arrive with more refined techniques for extracting ore. The largest group came from Cornwall, which had been a mining center for centuries. Experienced Cornish miners were attracted to the lead mining opportunities in Mineral Point, and by 1845 roughly half of the town&#x27;s population had Cornish ancestry. The original dwellings of some of these early Cornish immigrants have been restored at the Pendarvis Historic Site in Mineral Point. Lead continued to be produced in abundant quantities by the Cornish miners, and in 1847, the &quot;Mineral Point Tribune&quot; reported that the town&#x27;s furnaces were producing 43,800 pounds (19,900 kg) of lead each day.

Mining activity in Mineral Point began to decline in the following years. In 1848, the same year that Wisconsin achieved statehood, gold was discovered in California. Many experienced miners left Mineral Point to look for gold, and in all, the town lost 700 people during the California Gold Rush. While the lead industry in Mineral Point continued into the 1860s, the town never recovered its former importance. 

In November 1858, the residents of Iowa County voted to move the county seat to nearby Dodgeville, by a majority of 350. Mineral Point contested this election, accusing some residents of Dodgeville of corruption, and asserting that the law enabling the election was not sufficiently publicised. The case was elevated to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and Judge Byron Paine delivered the proceeding opinion in favour of Mineral Point on July 11, 1859, following which the residents of Mineral Point fired a cannon towards Dodgeville in celebration. An intense rivalry was harboured between the two towns, and a renewed election took place on April 2, 1861, during which a majority again voted to move the county seat to Dodgeville, where it remains today.

As lead mining declined in Mineral Point, zinc mining and smelting became important new industries. Zinc ore was discovered with increasing frequency near the bottoms of old lead mines. The Mineral Point Zinc Company was founded in 1882, and by 1891 it was operating the largest zinc oxide works in the United States at Mineral Point. Zinc mining and processing continued on a large scale until the 1920s.

In 1897 Robert M. La Follette gave his &quot;The danger threatening representative government&quot; speech in Mineral Point.

In the 1930s, a local resident, Robert Neal, together with his partner, Edgar Hellum, aimed to preserve some of the history of the Cornish miners&#x27; and settlers&#x27; stone structures. Over the next decades, they bought and restored buildings, and turned one into a popular Cornish restaurant attracting tourists. They had both studied art, and they also attracted other artists to move to the area. These buildings are now the Pendarvis Historic Site.

<text>Hebron is a town in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,043 at the 2020 census. The census-designated place of Hebron is located in the town.

==History==

The first steps toward the settlement of the town of Hebron, state of Wisconsin, Jefferson County, was made by the Rock river claim company, who, December 20, 1835, made a claim of about half a section of land on section 2, embracing a water-power formed by Bark river. This company consisted of sixteen persons, among whom were, Solomon Juneau, Dwight Foster, Jonas Folts, Enoch G. Darling, Elisha W. Ajitant David Sergeant, Milo Jones, George Homer, Lu I. Barber, Daniel Wells, William Paine, William Brown, Thomas Holmes and John Gale. The next year the company commenced the erection of a sawmill, under the superintendence of Alvin Foster . And notwithstanding the many inconveniences resulting from high prices, scarcity of provisions, and the difficulty of transportation, the company pushed forward the enterprise. They completed the mill in the fall and winter of 1836 and ‘37. In the spring of 1837, it was set an operation by Enoch G. Darling, one of the company—and took the name of the Bark River Mills. The company continued the ownership until the fall of 1839, when it passed into the hands of Daniel Wells, of Milwaukee; and subsequently into the hands of the John F. Fields, the hand from him it was purchased, November 4, 1844, by Joseph Powers, the present proprietor. Near the mills was erected a mill house, by Enoch G. Darling, in the summer of 1837—a framed building, and the first erected in the county. 
About this time, Horace Churchell, Cyrus Cushman, Samuel M. Jones, and Darius F. Jones, settled in the town near the mills, but did not to any extent turn their attention to farming—the lumbering interest absorbing their attention. From this time up to the spring of 1842, the town was only visited by the inhabitants of the surrounding prairies and openings on account of its lumbering interest, and by the Indians in winter as a safe and comfortable retreat, and to hunt the deer with which the woods abounded. In the spring and fall of 1842, it commenced settling with great rigidity.

The territorial legislature of 1846 passed an act taking three towns from Bark River; the town of Sullivan, the town of Palmyra and the town of Tunbridge. The latter was town 6, range 15 east, now the north half of Hebron and the east part of Jefferson, leaving town 5, range 15 east, as Bark River.
“This division was not satisfactory to the people of Bark River, as there was a continuous jangle between the residents living east and west of the river (Bark). Brinks Mills wish to be considered the hub, while denizens on the west side were just as strenuous for Bark Mills. While the two towns were together in 1846, the town meeting was held at Brink Mills, and a compromise ticket elected, namely: Jonas Folts, chairman; Elijah T. Williams, Samuel Wing, supervisors; Ebenezer Giles, town clerk; D. B. Peck, J. K. Pike, P.A. Feuner, justices of the peace; Nelson Fryer, assessor; Noah Grover, collector; Isaac Joslin, Noah Grover and Elijah Higgins, constables. The residents on the west side of the river secured nine of the twelve officers.
“The act creating the town of Tunbridge, designated the house of Cyrus Cushman as the place for holding the first town meeting. Willard Grant was moderator of the meeting; Stephen Benjamin McCune, clerk. (He is the octogenarian of Whitewater, whose white whiskers are turning black). The supervisors elected were: Samuel T. Clothier, chairman, S.B. McCune, John Jackson; town clerk, Edward F. Hutchins; road commissioners, Rufus H. Parker, Daniel Marble and Spencer Thayer; collector, William Reynolds; treasurer, H.J. Munroe.
“All of the officers lived on the south line of the town and on the Fort road, and out-voting the Cushman contingent, and locating the next meeting at the Munroe school house, which never occurred, as measures were on the table that ended the town of Tunbridge. There were numerous meetings held by the people of the two towns. Some at Brinks Mills and some at Bark Mills, and the question agitated of dividing the town of Bark River. Some were opposed.
“A petition that was numerously signed, was to divide the town of Tunbridge, taking the south half, and all of Bark River east of the river for a town, and all west of the river for another, and attaching the north half of Tunbridge to Jefferson. This prevailed. Laws were passed in accordance with the prayer of the petitioners. There was a great time in selecting a name. Meetings were held to select names. Most every one suggested a name.

An adjournment was had to the Munroe school house for the next week. The night agreed upon was a rainy one, and only three put in an appearance, namely, Samuel T. Clothier, William R. Case and J.R. Van Norman. A weekly singing school was held at the school house, and the singing books left on the desks. The trio were all singers, and to while away the time opened singing books, and sang piece after piece, among the Hebron. They sang the tune once, then again and again, at the suggestion of Clothier, who remarked, ‘I like this tune, and I think the name a good name for our town.’

To this the others agreed, so says Case, and the report went out that the adjourned meeting, to select a name, for the new town, had agreed upon the name of Hebron. The name met with favor, and the sentiment of the community was crystallized into law. Cold Spring was created and named the same session, the name of Bark River disappearing, as the name of a town, likewise Tunbridge. An old timer said, ‘There were many laughable features about the naming of the town.’ The late Joseph Green suggested the name of Greenbush, but was jumped upon. It was claimed he wanted to hand down his name, and that of ten children. N. P. Parsons was not in favor of having two towns, and he proposed a name for the sections lying each side of the river, &quot;Uni,&quot; a contraction of you and I.
“The first town meeting of the town of Hebron was held April, 7th, 1847. Samuel T. Clothier, Enos J. Higbee, Seth Peter, supervisors; Seth Peter, town clerk; John Burnham, treasurer; committee of highways, Daniel Marble, Gideon Leavitt and Corydon Culver.&quot;

<text>Jefferson is a city in and the county seat of Jefferson County, Wisconsin, United States. It is at the confluence of the Rock and Crawfish rivers. The population was 7,793 at the 2020 census. The city is partially bordered by the Town of Jefferson.

==History==
Jefferson&#x27;s location was selected to make use of the water power and transportation opportunities offered by the Rock River. It was the furthest point a steamboat could navigate the Rock in 1839. Later bridges built downstream prevented such navigation.

Jefferson&#x27;s founders were settlers from New England, particularly Connecticut, rural Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, as well some from upstate New York born to parents who had migrated there from New England shortly after the American Revolution. These people were &quot;Yankees&quot; descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal as well as the end of the Black Hawk War.

When they arrived in what is now Jefferson there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie, the New Englanders built farms, roads, and government buildings and established post routes. They brought many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, establishing many schools as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some had converted to Methodism and others had become Baptists before moving to what is now Jefferson. Jefferson, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its early history.

Jefferson was incorporated as a village by an 1857 act of the Wisconsin Legislature, and was then incorporated as a city in 1878.

During World War II, Camp Jefferson, a prison camp for German POWs, was erected at the Jefferson County Fairgrounds. The Jefferson County Fairgrounds hosted horse buggy racing prior to the renovations to the new fairgrounds.

Gemuetlichkeit Days was started in 1971 to celebrate the German heritage of many of the residents of the Jefferson area. The festival was first held under tents in the downtown area. The festival quickly grew and in 1975 the festival was moved to the Jefferson County Fair grounds and has been held there every year since then.

<text>Palmyra is a village in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, United States, along the Scuppernong River. It was named after the desert oasis city of Palmyra, Syria, due to its dry, sandy soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crook 1899 https://archive.org/details/mineralwatersun00croogoog/page/n537 539&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The population was 1,719 at the 2020 census. The village is adjacent to the Town of Palmyra.

==History==
The Town of Palmyra was established in 1846. In 1876, part of the Town of Palmyra was incorporated as the village of Palmyra.

Palmyra was known for its mineral springs. The Palmyra Springs Sanitarium was established in 1870, situated on what is known today as Lower Spring Lake. The sanitarium was a substantially built four-story brick structure containing spacious halls, wide verandas, and modern health and wellness accessories. The building contained facilities for the administration of various forms of electro-shock massage. The rooms were spacious and luxuriously furnished, providing a variety of salt, shower, shampoo, natural mineral, Turkish, and Russian style baths. There was a large gymnasium, theater, music hall, billiard parlors, bowling alleys, archery and tennis courts. The surrounding forty-acre forest of native oaks was referred to as the Sanitarium Grove - today part of the Southern Kettle Moraine State Forest - which contained winding pedestrian paths and resting nooks. The sanitarium was one and half miles from a large spring known by name as the Aurelian Spring, the Great Geyser Spring, or the Big Blue Spring. It was 50 feet across, 38 feet deep, with a flow of clear crystal-blue water that was believed to have therapeutic remedial value. A dam and spillway was later built downstream of the Great Geyer Spring, forming what is today known as Blue Spring Lake. In 1924, the sanitarium became the Druggist&#x27;s National Home, a home for aged and infirm druggists, but a few years later, interest in the therapeutic mineral treatments declined and the facility was closed. In the late 1950s, the building was razed and the land leveled.

<text>Wonewoc is a village along the Baraboo River in Juneau County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 758 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==
The name “Wonewoc” is of Indigenous American origin, probably meaning &quot;howling hills&quot;. However, at the time of colonization, the site and subsequent town were known to the native Hoocąk (Winnebago) people as &quot;Wonį́wąk&quot;, which derives ultimately from an infinitive meaning, &quot;to be wicked, bad.&quot; However, Josephine White Eagle says that &quot;wōnį́wąk&quot; means more precisely, &quot;you (sg.) are naughty, foolish, not thinking.&quot; Apparently, a settler asked a native resident, &quot;What do you call this place?&quot; and the man replied, &quot;You&#x27;re a knucklehead.&quot;

George and Lucinda Willard first settled the area in 1851. The town was incorporated as a village in 1878, and once the railroad was built village growth exploded. The population of the town was largely settled by Yankee colonists from New England, according to the 1860 census.

==History==
Before the town of Benton was settled, Indians of the Pottawatomie and Winnebago tribes would pass through its modern boundaries. American Indians were also the first to discover the rich lead deposits located in the area, which is part of the Driftless Area, in what is now southwestern Wisconsin. As Europeans moved through the region, the American Indians of the area introduced them to the rich mineral deposits that would later draw them to the region en masse.

Though Europeans passed through and visited the region, threats from the Indians kept the area from being permanently settled until Andrew Murphy, along with his wife Catherine, five sons, a French voyageur named Francois and a servant named Peggy, established a homestead in the area that is now the town of Benton in 1827. Though no one settled for several years after the Murphy party, the relative safety after the conclusion of the Black Hawk War and the prosperity promised by the rich lead deposits brought large numbers of settlers.

Benton continued to grow and prosper, as the need for lead during the Civil War helped Benton recover from the Panic of 1857. Agriculture, too, fueled Benton&#x27;s economy, and by the end of the 19th century Benton was home to three churches, four general stores, and many businesses.

Benton has long since moved from the extractive economy of mining to one based in agriculture and modern business.

<text>Darlington is a city in and the county seat of Lafayette County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,462 at the 2020 census. The city is surrounded by the Town of Darlington.

==History==
The first residence within the city limits of Darlington was a log house owned by Jamison Hamilton in 1836. He laid out the village of Avon, or Centre, in 1847. Darlington was first organized in 1849, but was known for a long time as the town of Centre. The first town meeting was held on April 3, 1849, with 82 votes being cast.

The first store was built in 1848. Two more were started in 1851, a millinery shop run by Miss Graham and a store run by Mr. Driver. The first hardware store was opened in 1852 by the Willett Brothers, and the first drug store was opened by J. Collins and Dr. Blair, who was the first resident physician in the city. The first school was opened in the winter of 1850, with 15 students. The first religious services were held some time in 1851 in the barn of Jamison Hamilton. The Mineral Point Railroad reached the town in the fall of 1856, and the citizens were very pleased that their dream of expanding their &quot;village&quot; was finally coming true.

In 1857, the county seat was moved from Shullsburg to Darlington, and the courthouse was built using county funds (Other reports assert this county court house is the only one in Wisconsin, paid for with a charitable gift. The donor has been described as a successful mineral miner in the county.). The courthouse was also moved to Darlington in 1861, and in 1869 the town of Centre became known as Darlington. The name was changed because Joshua Darling purchased the land in 1850 with the help of J.M. Keep and J.B. Lynde. The survey of the original streets and blocks of the community took place in June 1850 by Josiah Richardson and H. H. Gray, assisted by an Indian named January.

The streets of the town were named after the wives of the planners and prominent men of the town, such as Minerva, Mary, Harriet, Lucy, Louisa, and Cornelia. &quot;Minerva was the wife of James G. Knight, the first president of the village, and Mary was the wife of Josepheus Driver, one of the first businessmen of Darlington. Harriet was the wife of Hamilton Gray, and Lucy was the wife of William K. Jackman. Louisa was the wife of Isaah Stockwell, and Cornelia was the wife of James M. Keep, one of the original founders of the community.&quot; He also aided Joshua Darling in the purchase of the land.

===Ringling Brothers circus===
Alfred T. Ringling established himself in Darlington, Wisconsin at the age of 20, working as a harness maker in his own shop. He gave little shows for the students in schools and citizens of Darlington and the surrounding towns, with an act that included having four strong farmers lift up a plow, with Alfred lying beneath it. They positioned the plow so Alfred could balance it on his chin. It was a major crowd pleaser.

The Parson Brothers, Joe and Alfred E. &quot;Butch&quot; Parson, from Darlington were also interested in the circus. Joe Parson, the older of the two, worked in a lumber camp in the winter months in the 1870s. It was said that he bought a bison that he saw grazing in a field one spring when he was returning from the lumber camp. He made a deal with the farmer that owned it, and Joe gave the farmer his horse in exchange for the bison. Joe started showing his bison at carnivals and festivals, and he purchased a few more animals to form a show he called &quot;The Great Palace Show&quot;. Alfred Ringling, or Al, worked in the Parson Brother&#x27;s show as a ropewalker in 1881 and most likely 1882. He also worked in Parson&#x27;s &quot;Great Grecian Show&quot; in 1883.

When the Ringling Brothers (Alfred T., John, Charles, and Otto) were planning their own circus, they invited the Parson Brothers to join them in 1884. The Ringlings had their own band, with Al playing the bass drum, John the cornet, and Charles and Otto the trombone and tuba. John was the leader of their band. The Parsons joined the Ringlings in 1887. Joe Parson did horseback-riding stunts and also performed on the high wire. Butch Parson ran the concession wagon, selling items such as pink lemonade, peanuts, popcorn, Cracker Jacks, cigars, and paper fans. Butch managed the stand and paid a monthly sum to the Ringlings, hired his own help. The Ringlings stored and took care of his concession wagon for him.

Both sets of brothers worked well with each other for a time until the Ringling Brothers felt that the Parson Brothers were making more than them with the concession wagon. In 1906, the Parsons cleared around $30,000, for a 44% profit. The Ringlings wanted to run the concessions by themselves so they could clear more of a profit. Through a series of letters, Otto Ringling tried to sever the ties to the Parsons in December 1907. At first, the letters were formal, requesting that the Parsons allow the Ringlings to run the stand. By November 1908, Otto Ringling wrote to Butch Parson completely ending the relationship between the two families. In the letter, he said that the Ringlings could no longer store the concession wagon because of lack of space. Although their relationship with the Ringlings ended, the Parsons had become very wealthy from the concession wagon.

<text>Shullsburg is a city in Lafayette County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,226 at the 2010 census. The city is adjacent to the Town of Shullsburg. Founded in 1827 it is one of the oldest settlements in Wisconsin. There are 34 buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places on its historic Water Street Commercial District. It is located within the Midwestern Driftless Area and is known for its history of lead mining and its cheese industry. 
== History ==
Shullsburg was founded during the 1820s in parts by Jesse Shull and Henry Gratiot and due to their ventures into lead mining. Following the Black Hawk War conflict Gratiot&#x27;s Grove (Wisconsin) and other small settlements consolidated into Shullsburg. In 1841 Missionary Priest Samuel Mazzuchelli platted the Northeast section of town and named the streets after the virtues of life. After arrival of railroad in the 1880s the Water Street Commercial District saw the construction of its many brick and limestone buildings. The Shullsburg High School was built in 1900 designed by the town physician Dr. C.C. Gratiot. The 8-Acre Badger Park, designed by Phelps Wyman, was completed in 1942 by the Works Progress Administration and lights were installed at its baseball park in 1948. In February 1943, a collapse at the Mulcahy mine killed two miners, then a second collapse killed six of the rescuers who were trying to dig the first two miners out. In 1974 the Emily Franz Scholarship Fund was formed to help high school students pay for college and is today worth 1.8 million dollars. The last working lead mine in the Upper Midwest Lead District closed at Shullsburg in 1979 and the town fell on hard times. During the 1990s and 2000s the restoration of buildings became important to building preservationists. In 2001 a new library and community center was built with private funds only. In 2016 it was named a Wisconsin Main Street Community.

=== St. Matthew&#x27;s Catholic Church and Parish ===
Founded in 1835 by Samuel Mazzuchelli, St. Matthew&#x27;s is one of the oldest Catholic parishes in Wisconsin. In 1852 construction of the current church began and was completed and dedicated on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day 1861. The Greek Revival architecture of the church stands on the towns highest point. It is built of limestone quarried from the local Rennick Quarry. During the 1890s an &quot;impoverished artist&quot; was hired to paint the Stations of the Cross and are known today for the beautiful depictions. In 1907 the steeple was felled in a storm and was replaced the following year along with the placement of the stained glass windows. Today the sextagonal steeple stands at 135 feet tall with a 12 foot cross. In 1918 an adjoining parochial school was built and staffed by Sisters of Mercy and it served students until 1969. In 2010 the parish celebrated its 175th anniversary with a mass led by Bishop Robert C. Morlino.

<text>Merrill is a city in and the county seat of Lincoln County, Wisconsin, United States. It is located to the south of and adjacent to the Town of Merrill. The population was 9,347, according to the 2020 census. Merrill is part of the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s Merrill MSA, which includes all of Lincoln County. Together with the Wausau MSA, which includes all of Marathon County, it forms the Wausau-Merrill CSA.

==History==
Merrill was first inhabited by the Chippewa Native Americans. The first European settlement there was a logging town named Jenny Bull Falls. By 1843, a trading post was constructed near the town; John Faely was the first settler. Within four years a dam, started by Andrew Warren, was constructed over the Wisconsin River. Warren then established the first mill powered by the dam, and other saw mills in the area. In 1870, T. B. Scott succeeded Warren, and the mill soon became increasingly successful. In 1899 the mill burned down. During that time the name of the community was changed to Merrill, in honor of Sherburn S. Merrill (1818–1885), the general manager of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, and Pacific Railroad.

In 1881, the Wisconsin Telephone Company began operation, with 20 phones in service. In 1883, the first City Council met and T. B. Scott was named the first mayor. By 1885, the population had risen to 7,000, approximately 3,000 less than Merrill&#x27;s population today. The railroad and passenger depot was a hub of social activity through the lumber industry&#x27;s boom years and after. It later became a community youth center, but has since been razed. By 1900, the timber industry was in decline and the community was compelled to diversify its economy.
In 1892, the Weinbrenner Shoe Company was established with Merrill headquarters.

In July 1912, the Wisconsin River and several of its tributaries flooded from Rothschild to Merrill, destroying several dams (active and abandoned), as well as causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage in Merrill.

==Geography==

Before 1837, the land where Tomahawk is now situated belonged to the Ojibwe, who traded actively with fur traders such as the American Fur Company and the Northwest Company. After the 1837 cession, the practical situation changed only slightly: the federal survey teams had not arrived yet, logging activity was still light, and Ojibwe continued to actively occupy the general area. There was a village just north of the modern Tomahawk, in the vicinity of modern Bradley, and a village on Skanawan Creek. The 1854 Treaty of La Pointe created the reservations at Lac du Flambeau, Lac Courte Oreilles and Bad River. Even after this treaty, the region was largely public domain land and the treaties allowed the Ojibwe usufructory rights to hunt, fish, gather wild rice and make maple sugar. Some Ojibwe received their annuity payments in Wausau until the payments ended in 1874. By that time most Ojibwe were living permanently on the reservations.

Logging activity from the Tomahawk River upstream began about 1860 and surged after the Civil War. By 1880 several families were living close to Tomahawk-Wisconsin river confluence, including owning property within the present city limits of Tomahawk. The location was variously known as Bouchard&#x27;s Station or The Forks, short for Forks of the Wisconsin.

Tomahawk traditionally traces its founding to the establishment of the construction camps for a dam and the railroad in 1886. The company leading the effort was the Tomahawk Land and Boom Company, headed by William H. Bradley, who is thus considered to be the principal founder of Tomahawk. The Tomahawk Land and Boom Company was owned 51 percent by the Chicago, Milwaukee and Saint Paul railroad, and 49 percent by the Land, Log and Lumber Company (Bradley and his partners). The dam was a large capital investment for the era, and was one of the largest in the world when it was completed. The town site was platted in 1887, with lots sold in Milwaukee that summer. The agent for the sale was Henry Payne. The city was incorporated in 1891. In the 10 years after the first construction camps were built, Tomahawk grew rapidly, boasting many stores, a three-story hotel, many saw mills, a paper mill, and service via three railroads.

Among the events highlighting Tomahawk&#x27;s history since that time are:

*1897: The first high school class graduated; among the graduates was Margaret McBride, who achieved prominence as a vocalist in New York City.
*1906: William T. Bradley, future mayor and adopted son of the city&#x27;s founder, brought the first automobile to the town.
*1914: The first airplane landed on north Tomahawk Avenue, there being no other runway then.
*1917: Tomahawk men enlisted and formed Company A, 119th Machine Gun Battalion, which was deployed to Europe via Waco, Texas.
*1929: The iconic Mitchell Hotel burned down, nearly taking the entire downtown with it. A new pump brought in from the Phillips fire department was the only thing that saved the day.
*1936: Tomahawk celebrated its 50th anniversary. The activities included a visit by Governor Philip La Follette.
*1941: The United States declared war on Japan, and many Tomahawk young men and women enlisted in military and other service.
*1951: Einar Ingman was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in Korea.
*1976: Governor Patrick Lucey visited to simultaneously dedicate a large new paper machine at the kraft mill (then owned by Owens-Illinois) as well as Highway 86 bridge.
*1986: Tomahawk celebrated its 100th anniversary.

<text>Manitowoc ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, United States. The city is located on Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Manitowoc River. According to the 2020 census, Manitowoc had a population of 34,626.

==History==
Purported to mean &quot;dwelling of the great spirit&quot;, Manitowoc derived its name from either the Ojibwe word &quot;manidoowaak(wag)&quot;, meaning spirit-spawn(s), or &quot;manidoowaak(oog)&quot;, meaning spirit-wood(s), or &quot;manidoowak(iin)&quot;, meaning spirit-land(s). In the Menominee language, it is called &quot;Manetōwak&quot;, which means &quot;place of the spirits&quot;. The Menominee ceded this land to the United States in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars, following years of negotiations over how to accommodate the Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Brothertown peoples who had been removed from New York to Wisconsin. In 1838, an act of the Territorial Legislature separated Manitowoc County from Brown County, keeping the native name for the region.

The first Europeans in the area were French fur traders who arrived in 1673. The Northwest Fur Company established a trading post in 1795. In 1835, before the transfer of land from the Menominee Nation to the United States, President Andrew Jackson authorized land sales for the region, drawing the interest of land speculators. William Jones and Louis Fizette were the two first recorded buyers on August 3, 1835, with the majority of the land being procured by the Chicago firm Jones, King, &amp; Co. Benjamin Jones, brother of William, took the Wisconsin property as his share and is considered the founder of Manitowoc. Early immigrant groups included Germans, Norwegians, British, Irish, and Canadians.

The first school in Manitowoc was held in the Jones warehouse, with S. M. Peake instructing the twelve children of the community. The first religious organization in the county, St. James&#x27; Episcopal Church, first met in 1841. Manitowoc was chartered as a village on March 6, 1851 and on March 12, 1870, was incorporated as a city. Manitowoc replaced neighboring Manitowoc Rapids as the county seat of Manitowoc County in 1853. The current Manitowoc County Courthouse was built in the city in 1906.

In 1847, Joseph Edwards built the first schooner in the area, the &quot;Citizen&quot;, a modest precursor to the shipbuilding industry that produced schooners and clippers used for fishing and trading in the Great Lakes and beyond the St. Lawrence River. In addition, landing craft, tankers and submarines became the local contributions to U.S. efforts in World War II.

On September 5, 1962, a piece of the seven-ton Sputnik 4 crashed on North 8th Street. Sputnik 4 was a USSR satellite, part of the Sputnik program and a test-flight of the Vostok spacecraft that would be used for the first human spaceflight. It was launched on May 15, 1960.

A bug in the guidance system had pointed the capsule in the wrong direction, so instead of dropping into the atmosphere the satellite moved into a higher orbit. It re-entered the atmosphere on or about September 5, 1962. A cast was made from the original piece before the Soviets claimed it, and the cast was displayed at the Rahr West Art Museum. A customer in a nearby art gallery jokingly suggested that the city should hold a festival to celebrate the crash. The city held the first Sputnikfest in 2008, which was organized by the head of both museums.

Manitowoc was historically a sundown town that prohibited African Americans from staying overnight. In 1968, the policy forced a visiting Gwendolyn Brooks to stay at Holy Family College, just outside of Manitowoc, after a poetry reading.

Manitowoc is home to the Wisconsin Maritime Museum, and is one endpoint of the ferry route of the SS &quot;Badger&quot;, which connects U.S. Route 10 to Ludington, Michigan.

Since the late 1990s, several new shopping centers have opened in the city, mostly on the southwest side of the city along Interstate 43, including the new Harbor Town Center shopping complex. The downtown area has also seen a resurgence, with several new restaurants opening, and the recent announcement of new $100,000+ condominiums on the Manitowoc River, along with a completion of the riverwalk trail. 

In December 2022, Manitowoc was designated Wisconsin&#x27;s World War II Heritage City by the US National Park Service. In early 2023, an 87-unit apartment building south of the Manitowoc River was completed. Also in 2023, Mayor Justin Nickels stated he planned to continue adding amenities along the river. The bulk of the redevelopment in the city has been undertaken by the public/private partnership the Manitowoc County Economic Development Corporation.

<text>Mishicot is a village in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,442 at the 2010 census. The village is adjacent to the Town of Mishicot.

== History ==
This area of Wisconsin was originally occupied by the Menominee, Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk peoples. By the end of French rule over the area in 1763, the Potawatomi had begun a move to the Detroit area, leaving the large communities in Wisconsin. Later, some Potawatomi moved back from Michigan to northern Wisconsin. Some but not all Potawatomi later left northern Wisconsin for northern Indiana and central Illinois.

In 1831, the Menominee ceded their claim to the area including what is now Mishicot to the United States. As a result of this treaty (Treaty of Washington), settlers could purchase land, but many fishermen still chose to live as squatters. At the same time, the more decentralized Potawatomi were divested of their land without compensation. Many emigrated to Canada because of invitations from other Native Americans already in Canada, favorable treaty arrangements, and a desire to avoid the harsh terms of the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. Although not all Potawatomi participated in the Treaty of Chicago, it was federal policy that any who did not relocate westward as the treaty stipulated would not be compensated for their land.

Mishicott resident Simon Kahquados, a Potawatomi leader and activist, traveled to Washington, D.C. multiple times in an attempt to get the land back. In 1906, Congress passed a law to establish a census of all Potawatomi formerly living in Wisconsin and Michigan as a first step toward compensation. The 1907 &quot;Wooster&quot; roll, named after the clerk who compiled it, documented 457 Potawatomi living in Wisconsin and Michigan and 1423 in Ontario. Instead of returning the land, a meager monthly payment was issued. Although Kahquados was unsuccessful, he increased public awareness of Potawatomi history. In 1931, 15,000 people attended his burial in Peninsula State Park.

The original spelling of the village&#x27;s name was Mishicott, with two T&#x27;s at the end, after the Potowatami Chief Mishicott. The second T was officially dropped around 1950, when the village was legally incorporated with the State of Wisconsin. Mishicott’s Potawatomi name was Na-ya-to-shingh, or Hairy Leg, for the fluffy white feathers on the upper leg of a horned owl.

The early settlers of the village and the surrounding rural farmlands came from a number of countries, but most prominently from Germany, Bohemia, Switzerland and Canada. In 1852, the name of the township and unincorporated village was changed to Saxonburg, but the name was reverted about 18 months later.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the village would have six hotels, three general stores, a movie theater, a grist mill, a brewery, and three churches. The first public school was organized in 1849, and the first public school building was constructed the same year.

==Ice cream sundae==

There is some debate between Ithaca, New York and Two Rivers over which city has the right to claim the title &quot;birthplace of the ice cream sundae.&quot; When Ithaca mayor Carolyn K. Peterson proclaimed a day to celebrate her city as the birthplace of the sundae, she received postcards from Two Rivers&#x27; citizens reiterating that town&#x27;s claim. Ithaca retaliated with an ad called &quot;Got Proof?&quot; in the Two Rivers newspaper.

Two Rivers&#x27; claim is based on the story of George Hallauer asking Edward C. Berners, the owner of Berners&#x27; Soda Fountain, to drizzle chocolate syrup over ice cream in 1881. Berners eventually did, and wound up selling the treat for a nickel, originally only on Sundays, but later every day. According to this story, the spelling changed when a glass salesman ordered canoe-shaped dishes. When Berners died in 1939, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; headlined his obituary &quot;Man Who Made First Ice Cream Sundae Is Dead.&quot;

==Professional football==

During the 1930s and 1940s, Two Rivers was home to training camps for numerous professional football teams. The city&#x27;s cool weather, athletic facilities, and general hospitality of the town&#x27;s people helped lure the teams. Washington High School, The J.E. Hamilton Community House, and Walsh Field were used for practices and meetings, while teams stayed at the Hamilton Hotel. The teams included the now defunct Columbus Bullies AFL in 1940 and the Chicago Rockets AAFC in 1947. Two Rivers also hosted the National Football League&#x27;s Pittsburgh Pirates, now known as the Pittsburgh Steelers, in 1939 and the Philadelphia Eagles in 1941 and 1942.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The traditional inhabitants of the area were the Ojibwe, the Potawatomi and the Menominee. However, the name is the Hochunk Mōsį́nį, the &quot;Cold Country,&quot; from &quot;mō&quot;, an old form of &quot;mą&quot;, meaning &quot;earth, ground, land, country&quot;; and &quot;sį́nį&quot;, &quot;cold.&quot; The Ojibwe ceded the territory to the United States in 1837 when they sold most of their land in what would become Wisconsin, though they were guaranteed the right to continue hunting, fishing, and gathering wild rice on the ceded lands. Similarly, the Potawatomi gave up their land claims in Wisconsin in 1833, and the Menominee ceded territory in this area in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. These treaties coincided with the establishment of the first sawmill in the area by a white settler, John L. Moore, in 1836, and enabled white settlement to begin in the area. Lumber quickly became the most important industry and drew other businesses and settlers to the town, which at the time was known as Little Bull Falls. After the closing of Fort Winnebago in 1845, a number of Métis families moved to Little Bull Falls, and in 1857 the town was renamed in honor of an Ojibwe chief from the Wisconsin River Band. Deforestation led to the collapse of the lumber industry in the early 20th century, but it was quickly replaced by the paper industry. In the neighboring Menominee language the town is called &quot;Mōsāpnīw&quot;, &quot;he dwells alone there&quot;, which is likely a close approximation of the eponymous chief&#x27;s name.

===Mock Communist invasion===
On May 1, 1950, local residents acting as Communist invaders seized control of Mosinee.

The action was a part of an elaborate pageant organized by the Wisconsin Department of the American Legion. The &quot;Communists&quot; dragged Mayor Ralph E. Kronenwetter and Police Chief Carl Gewiss out of their beds. Mayor Kronenwetter surrendered at 10:15 AM in the town&#x27;s new &quot;Red Square&quot; with a pistol to his back. The police chief was reported to have resisted and was &quot;liquidated&quot;.

Roadblocks were set up around Mosinee, the library was &quot;purged&quot;, prices of goods were inflated for the duration of the coup, and local restaurants served Russian black bread and potato soup for lunch.

As he arrived at a rally to restore democracy to the community the night of May 1, Mayor Kronenwetter suffered a heart attack and never regained consciousness. He died five days later on May 6, 1950 at age 49. The mayor&#x27;s doctor said the excitement and exertion probably contributed to his collapse.

Franklin Baker, commander of the local American Legion post, said, &quot;It was a terrible coincidence.&quot;

Local minister Will La Brew Bennett, 72, who, during the Communist invasion, demonstrated to the media how he would hide his Bible in the church organ if the Communists really invaded and was herded with other residents into a barbed-wire ringed &quot;concentration camp&quot; near &quot;Red Square&quot;, was found dead in his bed hours after the mayor&#x27;s death on May 7, 1950.

==Education==
=== Joseph Dessert Library ===
Joseph Dessert came from Canada to Mosinee (then known as &quot;Little Bull Falls&quot;) in 1844. He built and equipped a free library for the community. Dedicated on February 11, 1899, the building was used as a library, as well as a post office, village hall, and school, and it was the scene of many community events, including dances and balls. The library was the only place in the community with theater facilities, so amateur plays were often presented there, and school commencements were held in the Grand Hall. The library existed as a city library until 1974, when the library and municipal boards recommended that the Joseph Dessert Library should join the Marathon County Public Library. Since then, it has also come to be known as the Marathon County Public Library - Mosinee Branch.

Celebrations have marked two significant anniversaries for the library, the first in 1949 at the 50th anniversary, and the second in 1999 at the time of the library&#x27;s 100th year. Several renovations have also taken place, with the most recent occurring in 1995 as part of a county-wide building and improvement program for libraries. Today, the library maintains its status in the City of Mosinee as both an important community service and as a building significant to the history of the community. The library building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
