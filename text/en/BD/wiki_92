<text>The Vancouver Blazers were a professional ice hockey team that played in the World Hockey Association from 1973 to 1975. The Blazers played at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, sharing the facility with the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League. The Blazers were owned by local businessman Jim Pattison. The franchise moved to Vancouver after a single season in Philadelphia. Unable to establish a strong fan base in Vancouver, the team was moved again in 1975 to become the Calgary Cowboys.

==History==
The Blazers were one of the founding members of the World Hockey Association. Originally the team, called the Miami Screaming Eagles, was to be based in Miami, Florida, but due to financial problems and a lack of a suitable arena, the franchise was moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and debuted as the Philadelphia Blazers. After only one season in Philadelphia, the team relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia and became the Vancouver Blazers in 1973–74. After two seasons, the team was again relocated to Calgary, Alberta as the Calgary Cowboys for 1975–76. Two years later, the franchise folded.

==Vancouver Blazers==
After the 1972–73 WHA season ended, the Philadelphia Blazers&#x27; owners sold the team to Jim Pattison who moved the team north of the border to Vancouver, British Columbia where it was named &quot;Vancouver Blazers&quot;.

Pattison knew that in order to compete with the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL, who shared the same arena, he needed to attract a major star to the team, as Andre Lacroix, who had led the league in scoring the previous year, left to join the New York Golden Blades, while the team&#x27;s (and league&#x27;s) highest-paid player, Derek Sanderson, had been forced out at the end of the season in a major embarrassment to the team and league. Pattison tried to sign Boston star Phil Esposito, offering him $2.5 million over five years. Esposito decided to stay with the Bruins for less money.

The team performed poorly in their first year, finishing with a record of 27-50-1; despite this, Vancouver was such a strong hockey town that the Blazers actually led the WHA in attendance, drawing 9,356 a night, more than 50% above the average of the other eleven clubs in the league. The next season, 1974–75, the club improved to only two games below .500, only to see attendance slip to 8,014 a game, sixth in the 14-team WHA.

The Blazers&#x27; (and WHA&#x27;s) efforts to attract fans were certainly not helped by the machinations of the NHL, which was aggressively expanding to try and keep its rival out of premium arenas and markets. Prior to the WHA&#x27;s arrival, the Canucks had consistently finished well out of playoff contention. However, after the Blazers&#x27; first season in the Pacific Coliseum, the NHL not only expanded again but also dissolved the Canucks&#x27; tough East Division and placed the team in the much weaker Smythe Division.

The Canucks won the new Smythe Division, and consistently played to at or near capacity at Pacific Coliseum while the Blazers struggled to fill the building to half capacity. Under such circumstances, it was evident that Vancouver was not large enough to support both the NHL and WHA; thus after only two seasons on the west coast the team made its third franchise shift in three years, this time to Calgary, Alberta, where they were renamed &quot;Calgary Cowboys&quot;. The Cowboys would be the WHA&#x27;s second attempt in Calgary, as the Calgary Broncos were slated to start playing there for the inaugural WHA season. However, after Broncos&#x27; owner Bob Brownridge died, the franchise was placed in Cleveland instead.

The last active Vancouver Blazers player was Pat Price who retired in the NHL during the 1987-88 NHL season.

<doc id="269796" wikidata="Q6101432" url="?curid=269796" title="Izaak Walton Killam">
<text>Izaak Walton Killam (July 23, 1885 – August 5, 1955) was a Canadian financier.

==Early life==
Born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, he was the son of William Dudman Killam and Arabella Hunter (Belle) Cann.

==Business ventures==
As a young banker with the Union Bank of Halifax, Killam became close friends with John F. Stairs and Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook) who put Killam in charge of his Royal Securities. In 1919, Killam bought out Aitken and took full control of the company. His business dealings primarily involved the financing of large pulp and paper and hydro-electric projects throughout Canada and Latin America. One of his larger projects in his native province was the creation of the Mersey Paper Company Ltd. and its related electrical generating stations and shipping fleet.

In 1922, he married Dorothy Ruth Brooks Johnston. Notwithstanding his prodigious financial accomplishments, Killam was a very reserved man who eschewed publicity and was virtually unknown outside a small circle of close acquaintances. In 1927, he acquired &quot;The Mail and Empire&quot; newspaper and after reorganization it was later sold to the owners of &quot;The Globe&quot;, who merged it to create &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 1936. 

Killam died in 1955 at his Quebec fishing lodge. By then he was considered to be the richest man in Canada.

==Philanthropy==
Having no children, the Killams devoted the greater part of their wealth to higher education in Canada. When Killam died the government honoured his request to use his inheritance taxes and a large donation, coupled with those of Sir James H. Dunn, to establish the Canada Council for the Arts (Canada Council).

By the time of Mrs. Killam&#x27;s death, in 1965, the estate had grown to the point that she was able to bequeath million (equivalent to $million in ) into establishing the Killam Trusts.

The Killam Trusts are allocated to funding scientific research and artistic ventures across Canada, by way of a further endowment to the Canada Council, as well as endowments to five Canadian universities: the University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, Dalhousie University and McGill University. The endowment to the Canada Council funds the Canada-wide Killam Research Fellowships (established 1967) and Killam Prizes (established 1981),while the five universities use their endowments to fund research, programs and projects at those schools.

Dalhousie University in Halifax benefited the most, having received a $30million (equivalent to $million in ) bequest from Dorothy Killam&#x27;s estate in 1965, representing 32% of her fortune. The Killam Memorial Library constructed between 1966 and 1971 at a cost of $7.3million (equivalent to $million in ) was designed by architect Leslie R. Fairn and remains an enduring legacy to this day.

Money from the Killam estate also went to establish Izaak Walton Killam Hospital for Children in Halifax and the Montreal Neurological Institute in Montreal.

<doc id="269813" wikidata="Q1156865" url="?curid=269813" title="Indianapolis International Airport">
<text>Indianapolis International Airport is an international airport located seven miles (11 km) southwest of Downtown Indianapolis in Marion County, Indiana, United States. It is owned and operated by the Indianapolis Airport Authority and has flights to over 61 destinations in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Mexico. As of 2023, it was the 43rd-busiest airport in the U.S. and the busiest in Indiana with 4,788,376 passengers. 

The airport occupies in Wayne and Decatur townships in Marion County. IND is home to the second largest FedEx Express hub in the world; only the FedEx SuperHub in Memphis, Tennessee, surpasses its cargo traffic. Largely because of FedEx&#x27;s activity, IND consistently ranks among the top 10 busiest U.S. airports in terms of air cargo throughput. Republic Airways is also headquartered at the airport, and Allegiant Air maintains Indianapolis as a focus city.

The Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZID), one of 22 established FAA area control centers, is located on the airport property&#x27;s north side.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a medium hub primary commercial service facility.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Indianapolis Municipal Airport opened in 1931, replacing the older Stout Field as the primary city airport. The airport was initially built on about of land in the southwestern edge of the city, with an additional reserved for future expansions at the airport. In 1944, it was renamed Weir Cook Municipal Airport, after US Army Air Forces Col. Harvey Weir Cook of Wilkinson, Indiana, who had become a flying ace during World War I with seven victories and had died flying a P-39 over New Caledonia in World War II.

Indianapolis was one of many stops along the first transcontinental air/rail service between Los Angeles and New York that was started by Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT) in 1929. TAT would later become Trans World Airlines (TWA) and continued to serve IND until their merger into American Airlines in 2001.

Since 1962, the airport has been owned and operated by the Indianapolis Airport Authority (IAA). The IAA has an eight-member board with members appointed by the mayor of Indianapolis and other officials from Marion, Hendricks, and Hamilton counties in central Indiana. In 1976, the board renamed the airport Indianapolis International Airport.

From 1957 to 2008, the passenger terminal was on the east side of the airfield off High School Road. This now-demolished facility was renovated and expanded many times, notably in 1968 (Concourses A and B), 1972 (Concourse D), and 1987 (Concourse C and the attached parking garage). This complex, along with the International Arrivals Terminal (opened in 1976) on the north side of the airfield (off Pierson Drive), was replaced by the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal on November 12, 2008.

The April 1957 Official Airline Guide (OAG) shows 82 weekday departures: 24 Eastern, 22 TWA, 15 Delta, 11 American, 9 Lake Central and 1 Ozark. Eastern had a nonstop to Atlanta and one to Birmingham and TWA had two to New York-LaGuardia; no other nonstops reached beyond Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Louisville and Pittsburgh. The first jets were TWA Convair 880s in 1961. Westward nonstops did not reach beyond St. Louis until 1967 when TWA started a JFK-IND-LAX flight with a Boeing 707. In the mid-1970s, TWA ran a widebody Lockheed L-1011 on the nonstop flight to Los Angeles.

===Recent years===
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, USAir (later US Airways) had a secondary hub in Indianapolis with non-stop jets to the West Coast, East Coast, and Florida and turboprop flights to cities around the Midwest. USAir peaked at 146 daily departures (including its prop affiliates), with 49% of all seats. USAir ended the hub in the late 1990s.

FedEx Express began its hub at the airport in 1988, with an expansion of the hub occurring ten years later. The hub employs around 4,000 people and has a sort capacity of nearly 100,000 packages per hour, making Indianapolis the largest FedEx hub in the world outside of the company&#x27;s SuperHub in Memphis.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Indianapolis was a hub for then locally based ATA Airlines and its regional affiliate, Chicago Express/ATA Connection. After that airline entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2004, operations at IND were cut, then eliminated in 2006. ATA&#x27;s demise gave Northwest Airlines an opportunity to expand operations, making Indianapolis a focus city with mainline flights to the West Coast, East Coast, and the South. Northwest was later acquired by Delta Air Lines in 2008, and a decade later, Delta began service from Indianapolis to Paris in May 2018. This flight was the first ever non-stop transatlantic passenger flight out of Indianapolis. The flight, DL500, was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 1990, Air Canada began nonstop service from Indianapolis to Toronto Pearson International Airport, marking the first regularly scheduled international flight out of IND. Air Canada Jazz, which operated the flight from 2001, would be retired by Air Canada in 2012, and service to IND would continue under the new Air Canada Express brand.

In 1994, BAA USA was awarded a 10-year contract to manage the Indianapolis International Airport. The contract was extended three years but was later cut a year short at the request of the BAA. Private management ended on December 31, 2007, and control reverted to IAA. Also in 1994, United Airlines finished building its Indianapolis Maintenance Center at a cost of US$600 million. United later moved their maintenance operations to its sole maintenance hub located at San Francisco International Airport. Around 2006, runway 14/32 was shortened from to its present length because the south end was not visible from the new control tower.

A new midfield passenger terminal, which cost $1.1 billion, opened in 2008 between the airport&#x27;s two parallel runways, southwest of the previous terminal and the crosswind runway. A new FAA Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) building, the second tallest in the United States, opened in April 2006, the first component of the long-planned midfield complex. The Weir Cook Terminal itself opened for arriving flights on the evening of November 11, 2008, and for departures the following morning. HOK was its master designer, with AeroDesign Group (a joint venture of CSO Architects, SchenkelShultz Architecture, and ARCHonsortium) serving as the architect of record. Aviation Capital Management (Indianapolis), a subsidiary of BSA LifeStructures, was the airport&#x27;s program manager. Hunt/Smoot Midfield Builders, a joint venture of Hunt Construction Group and Smoot Construction was the construction manager. Thornton Tomasetti was the terminal&#x27;s structural engineer along with Fink, Roberts and Petrie. Syska Hennessy was the mechanical, electrical, &amp; plumbing engineer. In 2021, a six-person panel of Indianapolis members of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) identified the Col. H. Weir Cook Terminal among the ten most &quot;architecturally significant&quot; buildings completed in the city since World War II.

A , 22 MW solar farm is at the airport. It was the largest airport solar farm in the world when the second phase opened in 2014.

In August 2017, Allegiant Air announced it would open a $40 million aircraft base at the airport that would begin operations in February of the following year. The facility was to create 66 high-paying jobs by the end of year and house two Airbus aircraft.

On October 21, 2024, Aer Lingus announced nonstop flights to Dublin, Ireland beginning May 2025, marking the first transatlantic flight out of Indianapolis since 2020.

==Facilities==
===Airport hotel===
The Indianapolis Airport Authority voted on February 21, 2025, to build a new hotel at the airport. The 253-room Marriott Westin-branded hotel will connect to the west side of the terminal parking garage and will be a hotel. The hotel will feature a full-service restaurant and a seventh-floor lounge area with an airfield view open to the public, a fitness center, approximately 10,000 square feet of meeting space, dedicated parking with valet and a pedestrian passage through the hotel to the parking garage and terminal for airport employees and passengers. A groundbreaking for the Westin Indianapolis Airport hotel is expected for spring 2025, with an anticipated completion date in December 2027 and a cost of almost $205 million.

===Terminal===

Indianapolis International Airport has a single terminal with two concourses and a total of 39 gates. The current terminal opened in 2008 and is named in honor of Col. Harvey Weir Cook. It was one of the first designed and built in the U.S. following the September 11 attacks. International arrivals from Cancún, the only non-preclearance international route, are processed in Concourse A.

*Concourse A contains 20 gates.
*Concourse B contains 19 gates.

===Ground transportation===
Eight rental car operations and the Ground Transportation Center (where information about limousine, shuttle bus, hotel courtesy vehicles and other transportation services such as IndyGo bus service can be obtained) are located on the first floor of the attached parking garage. All pick-ups and drop-offs of rental vehicles also occur here, eliminating the need for shuttling customers to and from individual companies&#x27; remote processing facilities. The five-floor parking garage covers on each of its levels. It features a light-filled center atrium complete with a piece of suspended artwork and contains moving sidewalks to speed pedestrians into and out of the terminal building itself.

<doc id="269816" wikidata="Q9351" url="?curid=269816" title="Pikachu">
<text>Pikachu (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise, and the franchise&#x27;s mascot. First introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, it was created by Atsuko Nishida at the request of lead designer Ken Sugimori, with the design finalized by Sugimori. Since Pikachu&#x27;s debut, it has appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as various merchandise. While Pikachu has been primarily voiced in media by Ikue Ōtani, other actors have also voiced the character including Kate Bristol, Ryan Reynolds, Kaiji Tang, Hidetoshi Nishijima, Tōru Ōkawa, and Koichi Yamadera.

Classified as an Electric-type Pokémon, Pikachu is a large yellow mouse with a lightning bolt-shaped tail, and red sacs on its cheek which can generate large amounts of electricity. Originally designed to be the first part of a three-stage evolution line in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, Pikachu evolves into Raichu through the use of a &quot;Thunder Stone&quot; item, with Raichu intended to be able to evolve into &#x27;Gorochu&#x27;. However &#x27;Gorochu&#x27; was removed due to cartridge space concerns, and a pre-evolution for Pikachu, Pichu, was later added in the sequel titles &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;.

Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species, largely due to its appearance in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime television series as the companion of series protagonist Ash Ketchum. Pikachu has been well received by critics, with particular praise given for to its cute design, and it has been regarded as an icon of both the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise and Japanese pop culture as a whole.

==Conception and development==
Pikachu is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Midway through &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;″s development, lead designer Ken Sugimori felt that the game needed more &quot;cute&quot; Pokémon and was struggling to conceive of such designs. Attributing it to his male perspective, he brought in female Game Freak staff including Atsuko Nishida to join the development team. Tasked with developing the Pikachu species and its evolutionary line, she was given specific guidelines to work with, namely its role as an Electric-type Pokémon, that it evolved twice, and that the final evolution should &quot;look strong&quot;. Pikachu evolves into Raichu through use of the game&#x27;s &quot;Thunder Stone&quot; item. Raichu was originally planned to evolve into a Pokémon species dubbed Gorochu, but this was cut due to cartridge space concerns. Later in the franchise, Sugimori would create a Pokémon that evolved into Pikachu named Pichu to complete the trinity. Nishida developed the original Pikachu sprites using a single color identity chosen to work within the Super Game Boy&#x27;s hardware limitations. Afterwards, the design was finalized by Sugimori who, towards the end of development, drew the promotional art of all the species to give them a unified look and make any last-minute changes.

===Design===
Standing 1ft 4in (41cm), Pikachu is a bipedal rodent with long ears and feet but short arms. It has yellow skin, long pointed ears that end in black tips, red cheek sacs, and a tail shaped after a lightning bolt. It has a black pattern on its back, as Nishida felt since this part of the character would face the player during gameplay, it &quot;would be better to put something there rather than having it be perfectly smooth.&quot; While preliminary designs took inspiration from mice or rabbits, as the Pokémon Rattata already existed at this point in development she instead modeled the species after squirrels. Nishida stated in an interview that she was obsessed with squirrels at the time due to their &quot;comical&quot; movement, and had the idea to have Pikachu store electricity in their cheeks similar to how squirrels store food. Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri however chose to change the species to be a type of mouse when he was designing the setting.

Nishida was helped during the creation process by fellow developer Koji Nishino, who grew fond of Pikachu as a result and consistently encouraged the design to be made cuter, something she was happy to oblige. Due to his fondness for Pikachu, he made it more difficult to find in the original games, joking he wanted to &quot;keep it for himself&quot;. Despite initial concerns that players would not be interested in seeking out Pikachu, Sugimori showed the design to the game&#x27;s development team, where the character was instantly popular. Pikachu&#x27;s design with the release of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; was initially pudgier in build, but in media and games that followed was changed over time to have a slimmer waist, straighter spine, and more defined face and neck. According to Sugimori, these changes originated from the anime adaptation of the franchise where it made Pikachu easier to animate, and were adopted to the games for consistency. The older design, nicknamed &quot;Fat Pikachu&quot; by fans of the series, was revisited in &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, where Pikachu received a special in-battle &quot;Gigantamax&quot; form resembling its original design. This Gigantamax form was designed by James Turner, who served as art director for &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;.

===Localization and as a mascot===
Series director Junichi Masuda stated that Pikachu&#x27;s name was one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort of wanting to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences. The name is derived from a combination of two Japanese onomatopoeia: &quot;ピカ (pika)&quot;, a sparkling sound, and &quot;チュー (chū)&quot;, a sound a mouse makes. When localizing the games for the United States, Nintendo of America&#x27;s staff initially proposed to redesign &quot;cute&quot; Pokémon in order to appeal to an American audience. According to Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara, they had proposed to change Pikachu to look like &quot;something like a tiger with huge breasts. It looked like a character from the musical &quot;Cats.&quot;&quot; Taken aback, he had asked them how it was supposed to be Pikachu, and in response they pointed to the character&#x27;s tail. This suggestion was scrapped, and Pikachu used the same design in the west as it did in Japan. However, Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata recalled the events differently. At the time, Iwata was working at HAL Laboratory, and one of the localizers upon seeing the Pokémon designs stated &quot;Something this cute can&#x27;t be called a &#x27;monster&#x27;&quot;, arguing monsters should be muscular and fearsome. As a result, the localization team drew up a muscular redesign of Pikachu for Iwata to submit to Game Freak. Iwata refused, stating his reaction was &quot;There&#x27;s no way we can show this to the people who made &quot;Pokémon&quot;.&quot;

Initially considered alongside Clefairy as lead characters for franchise merchandising, Pikachu emerged as the mascot of the anime series due to its popularity amongst schoolchildren and appeal to both boys and girls. Sugimori felt female players in particular were drawn to &quot;cute&quot; characters like Pikachu, stating in an interview with &quot;Famimaga 64&quot; magazine &quot;Some girls just collect 50 different Pikachu&quot;. The development team considered Pikachu to appeal to a larger demographic due to more closely resembling a &quot;pet,&quot; believing that those buying merchandise would wish to have it in their home. Masakazu Kubo, a member of the anime&#x27;s development team, stated that a &quot;checklist&quot; was involved in making the choice. He stated that their criteria required a warm design, a non-threatening color, a face that could convey emotion, a vocalization pronounceable by children, and a cute appearance, all of which Pikachu had. Pikachu was additionally selected for the role due to the fact that picking one of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;″s three starter Pokémon—Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle—would have created a &quot;gap&quot; with children who did not select the one used in the anime.

===Voice===
For the vast majority of appearances Ikue Ōtani has voiced the character since it was introduced in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime. Ōtani records new lines for many of Pikachu&#x27;s reappearances, and stated that despite the similar dialogue &quot;If you don&#x27;t have a clear understanding of what you want to say in the scene and come up with a plan for your performance, you won&#x27;t convey anything... Because, if there&#x27;s the same nuance, then it would just be OK to use [previously] recorded material.&quot; In the anime series, Pikachu only speaks using its name. Initially, it was planned for Pikachu to slowly become more adept at human speech as the series progressed, but these plans were dropped during production of the series. Ōtani voices the role in all languages which is unlike other Pokémon voice actors, where the actor is different in each country&#x27;s anime dub. Masuda stated Pikachu&#x27;s voice was kept consistent across languages so its name would be universal across the world.

Ōtani has voiced the character in the main series video games, and also reprised the role for every installment of the fighting game crossover series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;. Digitized recreations of her performance in the anime were used for Pikachu&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;, and she later voiced the character from the 2013 games &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; until the 2022 game &quot;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&quot;. In all other appearances, Pikachu uses an in-game digitized &quot;cry,&quot; a sound effect used to represent animal cries in the games. This cry had previously been used to represent Pikachu audibly in the main series games prior to &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. Other voice actors have voiced Pikachu in English. Kate Bristol briefly portrayed the role in &quot;Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!&quot;, for a line of dialogue where Pikachu talks to Ash, with Bristol stating she attempted to emulate Ōtani&#x27;s portrayal for the line. Abby Espiritu portrayed the role in the web series &quot;Pokémon: Path to the Peak.&quot; Espiritu stated that she initially assumed she was portraying Pikachu for a scratch tape before she learned she was portraying the role for the series.

== Appearances ==

=== In video games and anime ===
Pikachu has appeared in all main series &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games except &quot;Pokémon Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; and its sequel. Pikachu features prominently in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series and films, which focus on the adventures of series protagonist Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu. Ash&#x27;s Pikachu is initially disobedient, but after Ash saves it from a flock of Spearow, it warms up to Ash, and the pair become friends. Ash journeys to train and capture Pokémon while the members of the villainous organization Team Rocket attempt to steal Ash&#x27;s Pikachu.

The game &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; features a Pikachu, which is given to the player as their first Pokémon. Based on Ash Ketchum&#x27;s Pikachu from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, it refuses to stay in its Poké Ball, and instead follows the main character around on screen. The player character can speak to it, and it displays different reactions depending on how it is treated. &quot;Pokémon Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;, which are inspired by &quot;Yellow&quot;, have Pikachu as a starter in one of its two versions. This starter Pikachu has access to several secret techniques and exclusive moves, which are used to progress throughout the game. Seven forms of Pikachu, which wore caps belonging to Ash Ketchum across different seasons of the anime, were released in the games &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot; as well as their &quot;Ultra&quot; versions via special event distributions, with another round of distributions in &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot; additionally adding one with Ash&#x27;s cap from &quot;Pokémon Journeys: The Series&quot;.

&quot;Pokémon Omega Ruby&quot; and &quot;Alpha Sapphire&quot; introduced five new forms of Pikachu, labelled &quot;Cosplay Pikachu&quot; which wore different outfits and could be used in in-game competitions known as &quot;Pokémon Contests.&quot; &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot; games also introduced two Z-Crystals exclusive to Pikachu, which allow Pikachu to use special, one-time use attacks that are more powerful than standard attacks.

Outside of the main series, Pikachu stars in &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; for the Nintendo 64; the player interacts with Pikachu through a microphone, issuing commands to play various mini-games and act out situations. The game &quot;Pokémon Channel&quot; follows a similar premise of interacting with the Pikachu, though without the microphone. &quot;PokéPark Wii: Pikachu&#x27;s Adventure&quot; and its sequel, &quot;PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond&quot;, features a Pikachu as the main protagonist. The game &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot; features a talking Pikachu who becomes a detective and helps the protagonist Tim Goodman solve mysteries.

Pikachu appear the games &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; and its sequel, &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;, games where the player takes pictures of Pokémon for a score. A Pikachu is one of the sixteen starters and ten partners in the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series. Pikachu has appeared in all five &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; crossover fighting games as a playable character, and in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; fighting game &quot;Pokkén Tournament&quot;, in both its normal form and as &quot;Pikachu Libre&quot;, based on &quot;Cosplay Pikachu&quot; from &quot;Omega Ruby&quot; and &quot;Alpha Sapphire&quot;. Pikachu has also appeared in other games, such as &quot;Pokémon Unite&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Rumble World&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Café Mix&quot;.

Following the anime season &quot;Pokémon Ultimate Journeys&quot;, which concludes the story of Ash and his Pikachu and retires them as main cast members, another Pikachu named &quot;Captain Pikachu&quot; was introduced as a major character in the follow-up series &quot;Pokémon Horizons&quot;, which featured an entirely new cast of characters. Ōtani portrayed the role of Captain Pikachu. Taito Okiura, the vice president of marketing for The Pokémon Company International, stated that Pikachu would &quot;continue to have a significant presence in the animated series and remain an icon for the brand&quot;.

===In other media===

For the 2019 live action film &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, the titular character was portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. Reynolds performed the character&#x27;s voice work, and also did motion capture for the character&#x27;s face and movements. Due to Reynolds not being on set, co-star Justice Smith would often act his scenes out to an eyeline representing Pikachu, such as a puppet or a tennis ball. Pikachu&#x27;s visual appearance in the film was built as if the character was an actual animal, with the visual effects team creating detailed skeletal and muscular systems for the Pokémon. They visited zoos and consulted animal experts in order to ensure Pikachu&#x27;s movements were accurate to real world animals. Pikachu initially started with rabbit-like movement, but eventually evolved movement-wise to have characteristics of multiple species, namely those of marsupials and marmosets. Its eyes were inspired by those of the sugar glider. In order to ensure the design maintained a line between realism and uncanniness, Pikachu&#x27;s fur frequently changed design. The team would often bring patches of fur to filming locations to see how the colors would respond to the area&#x27;s lighting. Hidetoshi Nishijima portrays Detective Pikachu&#x27;s voice in the Japanese dub of the film. Pierre Tessier voices the character in the French dub of the film. Ōtani voiced the character in a brief cameo appearance. This appearance was retained in all language versions barring the German dubbing of the film, which used a slightly deeper and more out of breath version of the dialogue.

Pikachu is featured in a 2021 Katy Perry music video, &quot;Electric&quot;. In the &quot;Pokémon Adventures&quot; manga, main character Red owns and uses a Pikachu. Other manga series, such as &quot;Electric Tale of Pikachu&quot;, and &quot;Ash &amp; Pikachu&quot;, feature Ash Ketchum&#x27;s Pikachu from the anime series. In &quot;Electric Tale of Pikachu&quot;, Ash gives him the name &quot;Jean Luc Pikachu&quot;, a reference to Jean-Luc Picard from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

On February 27, 2024, &quot;La Poste&quot; (France) issued a stamp commemorating Pikachu.

== Promotion and merchandise ==

As the mascot of the franchise, Pikachu has made multiple appearances in various promotional events and merchandise. In 1998, then Topeka, Kansas Mayor Joan Wagnon renamed the town &quot;ToPikachu&quot; for a day, and the renaming was repeated in 2018 by Mayor Michelle De La Isla with the release of the &quot;Pokémon Let&#x27;s Go&quot; games. Another promotional stunt, used to promote &quot;Pokémon&quot;&#x27;s debut in the United States, involved dropping 700 Pikachu plushes into a field by plane, while skydivers leapt from the planes and drove off in Pikachu themed cars. A &quot;got milk?&quot; advertisement featured Pikachu on April 25, 2000. A Pikachu balloon has been featured in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade since 2001, with different balloon designs being introduced since. Pikachu was the subject of an internet meme, known as &quot;Surprised Pikachu,&quot; where a screencap of Pikachu looking shocked in an episode of the anime is used as a reaction image.

Collectible cards featuring Pikachu have appeared since the initial &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot; released in October 1996, including limited edition promotional cards. One of these collectible cards was &quot;Pikachu Illustrator&quot;, limited to about 20-40 printed in 1998, and was auctioned off for about $55,000 in 2016, and then $375,000 in 2021. Another card, sold in 2022, went for nearly a million dollars. For the franchise&#x27;s 25th anniversary, The Pokémon Company announced special trading cards in 2021, each featuring 25 Pikachu drawn by 25 artists. A promotion at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam featured exclusive Pokémon Cards of Pikachu wearing Van Gogh&#x27;s grey felt hat. It was pulled from the exhibition due to safety concerns after scalpers mobbed the store when it came out. Several employees at the museum were suspended due to reported embezzlement of a large number of the cards. The card was later restocked in an attempt to dissuade scalpers, who had been re-selling cards at high prices. The character has also been used in promotional merchandising at fast-food chains such as McDonald&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, and Burger King.

Pikachu and ten other Pokémon were chosen as Japan&#x27;s mascots in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. ANA Boeing 747-400 (JA8962) planes have been covered with images of Pokémon including Pikachu since 1998. In 2021, the first Pokémon Jet (Boeing 747-400D) featuring entirely Pikachu debuted.

==Critical reception==
Pikachu has been well received by reviewers; it was ranked as the &quot;second best person of the year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; in 1999, who called it &quot;the most beloved animated character since Hello Kitty&quot;. The magazine noted Pikachu as the &quot;public face of a phenomenon that has spread from Nintendo&#x27;s fastest selling video game to a trading-card empire&quot;, citing the franchise&#x27;s profits for the year as &quot;the reason for the ranking&quot;, behind singer Ricky Martin but ahead of author J.K. Rowling. The book &quot;Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination&quot; stated that Pikachu greatly helped to sell the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, being described as the &quot;center of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; craze&quot; in Japan while also emerging as a leading symbol of the series when it was released in the United States. Pikachu has consistently been considered one of the most notable and influential anime, cartoon, and video game characters since its debut. The character has been regarded as the Japanese answer to popular &quot;Disney&quot; mascot Mickey Mouse, with &quot;Polygon&quot; writer Tracey Lien noting that its ubiquity and iconic design helped endear it to audiences, allowing it to attain significant popularity. It was noted as being part of a movement of &quot;cute capitalism&quot;. In 2024, a poll conducted by BAFTA with around 4,000 respondents named Pikachu as the twelfth most iconic video-game character of all time.

Pikachu&#x27;s resemblance to a cute pet was cited as making its design appealing. Its usage of the color yellow made it easy for children to recognize due to being a primary color. Additionally, the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh, which helped Pikachu&#x27;s popularity significantly. The color yellow in its design was noted to give Pikachu a &quot;softness&quot; to its design, due to the color yellow&#x27;s association with words such as &quot;sunshine,&quot; &quot;warmth,&quot; and &quot;happiness,&quot; with Susan Napier, a professor at Tufts University, stating that Pikachu was part of &quot;this very interesting and adventurous world, but it&#x27;s also fundamentally very re-assuring.&quot; Napier additionally noted that unlike similar popular &quot; mascots such as Hello Kitty, Pikachu did not lean towards a more masculine or feminine audience, leading to it becoming a more universal symbol. Pikachu&#x27;s rarity in the games has been cited as part of the reason for its popularity.

Zack Zwiezen of &quot;Kotaku&quot; praised the simplicity of Pikachu&#x27;s design, describing it as &quot;possibly one of the most iconic characters on the planet&quot; due to the design&#x27;s appealing features and &quot;instantly identifiable&quot; design. Dale Bishir of &quot;IGN&quot; described Pikachu as the most important Pokémon that impacted the franchise&#x27;s history, and further stated that &quot;Its irresistible cuteness, merchandising power, army of clones in every generation... if your mom calls every Pokémon &#x27;Pikachu&#x27;, then you know in your heart that it is the most important Pokémon of all time.&quot; The book &quot;100 Greatest Video Game Characters&quot; noted that Pikachu&#x27;s cute design and the emphasis on friendship in its various appearances across &quot;Pokémon&quot; media helped with making Pikachu a memorable character in the minds of fans. Matthew Byrd of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; noted that due to Pikachu&#x27;s rarity in the original games, it led to rumors spread via word of mouth, which contributed to a large following behind the Pokémon in conjunction with its appearance in the anime, leading to it being a well-known yet hard to find figure. Its unique design and cute appearance were also noted to have aided with its popularity.

Pikachu&#x27;s role in the anime has been subject of praise and analysis. Pikachu&#x27;s friendship with Ash has been analyzed for its similarities to Aristotle&#x27;s values of friendship, with the reciprocal friendship between the two being highlighted due to the equality between them being the reason for their success. The anime&#x27;s expansion of Pikachu&#x27;s character was described by professor and author Northrop Davis as humanizing Pikachu and making the Pokémon more appealing to audiences, as it allowed Pikachu to become a three-dimensional character with multiple character traits for audiences. Pikachu&#x27;s personality was described by the book &quot;Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination&quot; as helping to emphasize not only Pikachu as a character, but also helping in making the anime series as a whole more widely popular, with the reciprocal nature of Pikachu&#x27;s relationship with Ash in the vein of trainer and pet being appealing both to an older concept while still being futuristic in nature. Pikachu&#x27;s departure from the anime was also met with positive responses, due to the fact that its departure alleviated concerns about how its strength would be handled as the series progressed. The hashtag &quot;#ThankYouAshAndPikachu&quot; trended on Twitter following the announcement of their departure.

Pikachu&#x27;s voice has been analyzed for its ability to convey emotion despite only speaking one word, with children being able to determine the emotion of the character based on how the character sounds. The book &quot;Anime Impact: The Movies and Shows that Changed the World of Japanese Animation&quot; additionally analyzed how Pikachu&#x27;s voice and inflections on a specific word allowed an animalistic character to be seen as a separate character and entity by the audience. It stated that it allowed them to become more familiar with Pikachu&#x27;s character and grow more attached to it, allowing the audience to become properly invested with the franchise and the narrative. Meanwhile, &quot;TIME Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Lisa Eadicicco felt its cute appearance coupled with the baby-like pronunciations of its own name led to it becoming an appealing design. She further stated that Pikachu&#x27;s &quot;well-written&quot; appearance in the anime series led to Pikachu also having a strong personality, causing Pikachu to be seen not only as an object of cuteness, but also as a companion for fans. She believed its frequent appearances in promotional material for the series additionally helped to serve as an anchor for the series, with its presence helping to draw people into the wider world of the franchise.

The multiple aspects of media featuring Pikachu, including its popularization in the anime, were described as helping elevate Pikachu&#x27;s appeal to a wider audience. However, &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Patricia Hernandez criticized Pikachu&#x27;s over-representation in &quot;Pokémon&quot;-related media, highlighting Pikachu&#x27;s constant usage in marketing for the franchise. She stated that Pikachu&#x27;s overuse detracted from other Pokémon in the series, while also criticizing the overuse for its lack of originality. She further compared it to Mimikyu- a Pokémon who mimics Pikachu in an attempt to be loved- stating that the reason for Mimikyu&#x27;s popularity inherently lay in how much people were subconsciously aware of Pikachu&#x27;s overuse. &quot;TheGamer&quot;&#x27;s Stacey Henley cited similar sentiments, believing Pikachu&#x27;s consistent presence in marketing had made it an uninteresting Pokémon and an ineffective mascot, disliking its consistent presence in games over other Pokémon.

In 2008, a ligand believed to provide better visual acuity was discovered by the Osaka Bioscience Institute Foundation and named &quot;Pikachurin&quot;, in reference to the nimbleness of Pikachu. The name was inspired due to Pikachu&#x27;s &quot;lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects&quot;. In 2021, the Chilean independent politician Giovanna Grandón famously went to many protests during the 2019–2021 Chilean protests dressed in an inflatable Pikachu suit. She went on to be elected as a member of the Constitutional Convention of 2021–2022, and is known as Aunt Pikachu (Tía Pikachú). In July 2021 during the Group of Seven climate summit, a group of protestors dressed as Pikachu demonstrated on Gyllyngvase Beach, Falmouth, while in November 2021, a group of activists dressed up as Pikachu to protest Japan&#x27;s refusal to reduce coal consumption at COP26. In 2016, the &quot;Pikachu&quot;, also known as the &quot;Pokemonument&quot;, a fiberglass sculpture depicting Pikachu by an unknown artist, was installed in Lower Garden District, a New Orleans neighborhood. Within a few days, the sculpture was vandalized by someone with a baseball bat, but repaired. Some two weeks after its placement, the &quot;Pokemonument&quot; was removed, and an online statement from the artist said that the artwork would be auctioned to benefit restoration of the park&#x27;s fountains.

<text>Fort Wayne International Airport lies eight miles southwest of Fort Wayne, in Allen County, Indiana, United States. It is owned by the Fort Wayne-Allen County Airport Authority.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 359,800 enplanements in calendar year 2022, 7.15% more than 2021. Based on passenger enplanements, Fort Wayne International ranked #147 out of the 539 airports in the United States that received scheduled passenger airline service in 2022. As such, the airport is classified by the FAA as a &quot;nonhub&quot;, or an airport that has between 10,000 and 400,000 enplanements per year.

The airport has one terminal, the Lieutenant Paul Baer Terminal. Passenger flights reach seven airline hubs of Atlanta, Chicago, Charlotte, Dallas/Fort Worth, Detroit, and Minneapolis-Saint Paul, along with flights to Orlando, Punta Gorda (serving Fort Myers and Sarasota), Tampa, Phoenix, and seasonal service to Myrtle Beach, Sarasota, and Las Vegas. Together, flights from the airport to these fourteen cities serve over 790,000 combined arriving and departing passengers per year.

The airport has a air cargo center on the southwest side. The center was occupied by Kitty Hawk Aircargo, which had a hub at Fort Wayne until October 30, 2007, shortly after the carrier filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The former Kitty Hawk hub is now used by several aviation and non-aviation companies including Logistics Insight, FedEx Express, and Spinach Ball.

==History==
=== Baer Army Air Base &amp; Baer Field ===
The airport was built at a cost of $10 million as a United States Army Air Corps base just before World War II. A coalition of city business interests arranged to purchase a series of contiguous land parcels outside of Fort Wayne, demolish the existing structures, and present a unified parcel to the War Department in a short enough period to meet a competitive deadline for the Development of Landing Areas for National Defense (DLAND) initiative while preserving civilian access to the existing Paul Baer Municipal Airport (now Smith Field) on the north side of the city. War Department policy at the time required that bases and airfields be named for deceased military aviators, so other suggestions were rejected, and the department chose to name the new facility for Paul Frank Baer, a Fort Wayne native and World War I flying ace and early official for the Aeronautics Branch of the United States Department of Commerce (now the Federal Aviation Administration). The original airport had been named for Baer while he was still living, but he had since died in a seaplane accident in Shanghai while carrying mail and passengers for the China National Aviation Corporation. The War Department&#x27;s name choice necessitated a change of name for the municipal airport to avoid confusion, and city leaders elected to rename it for Art Smith, a pioneering airmail pilot, also a native of Fort Wayne, who also died in the course of his airmail duties.

Operations began in April 1941 under the name Baer Army Air Base, when Maj. Wilson T. Douglas of the Quartermaster Corps arrived as the base quartermaster.
The weather station was activated in August of that year, and the 13th Service Squadron was transferred from Chanute Field. The band arrived in October, and in November the 103 Communications Squadron arrived and the base was activated as Baer Field. The ordnance company departed in December, eventually reaching Port Moresby in New Guinea in February of the following year. The 307th Pursuit Squadron, which was activated in January, 1942, flying Bell P-39 Airacobra and Curtis P-40 Warhawk training aircraft. Once training was completed, the unit was sent to Atcham in England. On December 7, 1941, a month after Baer Field was activated, the Japanese Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service struck Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, causing the United States to formally declare war the following day.

Later in 1942, the Army Air Corps became the United States Army Air Forces. Over 100,000 military personnel served out of Baer Field and its more than one hundred structures during the war. A large number of ground and air squadrons trained at the facility before deployment to the European and Asiatic-Pacific Theaters of operations.

In December 1945, the facility was put on Temporary Inactive status, and in 1946 its name reverted to Baer Army Air Base. By January 1947, the base had shrunk to a small Air Communications Service detachment under Maj. Phillip Cartwright, consisting of the major and two other officers and no enlisted men, was concerned primarily with the storage and transfer of base records. The base was determined to be surplus to the needs of the War Department, except for areas reserved for reserve and Air National Guard activity. Thereafter, the base was used sporadically for the Army Air Forces Reserve and Air Force Reserve training until 1951, the base was again in use for the 163rd Fighter Interceptor Squadron, joined later that year by the 122nd Fighter Wing from Stout Army Air Field. Since the Korean War, the base has mostly hosted Indiana Air National Guard units but has occasionally hosted active-duty units like the 434th Air Refueling Wing (previously the 434th Tactical Airlift Wing) on a temporary basis.

The oldest original Baer Army Air Field hangar, Hangar No. 40, was in use from World War II until 2012. Hangar No. 40&#x27;s final tenant was FedEx Express, who used it until the hangar was damaged in a weather-related incident. After the damage to Hangar No. 40, FedEx moved into a portion of the former Kitty Hawk hub. Hangar No. 40 was demolished between March and April 2013.

===Fort Wayne Municipal Airport===
After the base was transferred to temporary inactive status, the city of Fort Wayne bought the airport from the federal government&#x27;s General Services Administration for one dollar, renaming it Fort Wayne Municipal Airport in 1946, though colloquially the entire complex was still referred to as Baer Field, a practice reinforced by the reactivation of the base as Baer Field for military purposes in 1951. Two passenger airlines initially served Baer Field: TWA and Chicago &amp; Southern Airlines; United Airlines appeared in 1947 with one DC-3 each way a day. C&amp;S merged with Delta Air Lines in 1953 and Delta is the airport&#x27;s longest-serving carrier, having served the airport in one form or another ever since. In 1953 the airport&#x27;s current terminal opened, replacing a converted military structure. The new permanent terminal had an air traffic control tower, an observation deck, and the &quot;Look-Out Dining Room&quot; restaurant with views of the ramp below. Late in the 1950s, Hilton Hotels opened the on-site Hilton Inn, which was sold in the 1980s as Hilton opened a hotel at the Grand Wayne Center. After Hilton sold the hotel, the on-airport Hilton was reflagged as first a Holiday Inn, and later became a Quality Inn and then a Days Inn. TWA, the first airline to serve Fort Wayne at what is now Smith Field, ended flights from Baer Field in 1963. Scheduled jet flights began in January 1967 on United Caravelles (United had been using the Vickers Viscount at Baer Field for several years). United&#x27;s jets were soon joined by Delta Douglas DC-9s. American Airlines flights began in 1974, initially to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (which opened that year) on Boeing 727s.

Along with Delta, United, and later American, locally-based Hub Airlines and other regional airlines flew to the airport in the 1960s and 1970s. The airport was the largest in Indiana not served by airlines classified as local service airlines by the Civil Aeronautics Board (e.g. Allegheny Airlines and Ozark Air Lines). Eastern Air Lines was the only CAB regulation-era &quot;Big Four&quot; airline that never served Baer Field.

In 1981, Baer Field&#x27;s 1953 terminal building was modernized and expanded with features like jetways to handle increased traffic brought on by the Airline Deregulation Act. During the period immediately following deregulation in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, Air Wisconsin, Piedmont Airlines (later US Airways), and Republic Airlines began service to Baer Field. American also changed their Fort Wayne flights from Dallas to Chicago O&#x27;Hare, while Air Wisconsin took over United&#x27;s Chicago route in partnership with United and later as United Express. Air Wisconsin also had a maintenance base on the west side of the airport in the 1980s and 1990s that handled BAe 146, BAe ATP, and later Canadair Regional Jet aircraft. After Air Wisconsin closed the maintenance base, Shuttle America briefly used the hangar before it lost its US Airways Express affiliation, flying passengers to the US Airways Pittsburgh hub. The former Air Wisconsin hangar was later used by Endeavor Air, and is presently in use by SkyWest. In 1985, management of Baer Field was transferred from the City of Fort Wayne to the newly established Fort Wayne-Allen County Airport Authority, with a board composed of equal numbers of City of Fort Wayne and Allen County officials.

===Fort Wayne International Airport===
In 1991 Baer Field was renamed Fort Wayne International Airport; the terminal was renamed to continue honoring Paul Frank Baer. Through the 1990s the airport underwent the largest expansion and revitalization in its history. Between 1994 and 1997, the terminal was again expanded, with design by MSKTD &amp; Associates, Inc. Other improvements included runway upgrades and the Air Trade Center on the southwest side of the property. In 1998, Fort Wayne International Airport started advertising the airport to the general public for the first time. That same year, Delta ended its mainline jet service to Atlanta. Although this ended a tradition of service dating back to Chicago &amp; Southern Airlines when the airport was converted to civil use in the 1940s, Delta continued to serve the airport via Delta Connection regional jets to Atlanta and Cincinnati. Other airlines serving the airport, including United, Northwest, and American, followed Delta&#x27;s lead in introducing regional jets such as the Canadair Regional Jet, Fairchild Dornier 328JET, Avro RJ85, and the Embraer ERJ-145 to the airport. Turboprops such as the Saab 340, Beechcraft 1900, ATR 72, and Dash 8 also continued to play a role for flights to destinations such as Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Detroit, occasionally alongside larger jets such as the DC-9, Fokker 100, and Boeing 737 on the same routes.

By 2000, Fort Wayne International Airport was handling record traffic. The record from 2000 was not broken until 2016. American Eagle resumed nonstop flights to Dallas/Fort Worth that year, which continue. Air Canada Express began a short-lived service to Toronto. The following year, Fort Wayne International Airport&#x27;s traffic dropped after the September 11 attacks. The slump continued for several years, prolonged by an ongoing fare war between Southwest Airlines, ATA Airlines, and others at Indianapolis International Airport, two and a half hours from Fort Wayne. In late 2003, ATA Connection began service from Fort Wayne International Airport to Chicago/Midway, the first low-cost carrier to serve the airport. Demand for the flights reached the point where airport management bought the on-site Days Inn to make room for more parking. An on-site hotel has not returned to the airport since, as many modern hotels on the southwest side of Fort Wayne offer shuttle service. ATA briefly switched the flight&#x27;s destination to Indianapolis before closing their regional division completely in early 2005. US Airways also ended service to Pittsburgh, their lone service from the airport, as part of a broader de-hubbing of Pittsburgh. US Airways left the airport, as the discontinued Pittsburgh service was not transferred to the airline&#x27;s other hubs in Philadelphia or Charlotte. However, nine years later after the merger of American Airlines and US Airways, Fort Wayne International Airport got service to both hubs. Around the same time as the departure of US Airways from the airport, Northwest stopped using mainline aircraft on their Detroit flights; unlike US Airways, NWA continued to serve the Fort Wayne to Detroit route using regional jets and turboprops. Delta planned on introducing service to Orlando from the airport in 2005; however, the flights were canceled days before the planned launch as the result of Delta&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In January 2007, a modernized air traffic control tower was opened on the south side of Fort Wayne International Airport, at a price of $9.7 million. One year later, Allegiant Air, the airport&#x27;s second low-cost carrier, began operations with service to Orlando. Allegiant continues to serve the airport and has since added service to Tampa/St. Petersburg, Myrtle Beach (seasonal), Punta Gorda (serving Fort Myers and Sarasota), and Phoenix. At one time, Allegiant also offered service to Fort Lauderdale from the airport and served Phoenix and Las Vegas before late 2008 as well. The Las Vegas and Phoenix services were initially discontinued in 2008 due to fuel costs and fuel price volatility. However, the Phoenix and Las Vegas suspensions were ultimately temporary as Allegiant began adding more fuel-efficient Airbus A319 aircraft in 2013. The A319 allowed the airline to serve Phoenix profitably from Fort Wayne. Allegiant then added the Airbus A320 to Florida routes. The MD-80 fleet has since been retired, making Allegiant an all-Airbus airline of A319 and A320 aircraft, the largest passenger aircraft used at the airport. The move to an all-Airbus fleet with lower fuel and maintenance costs enabled Allegiant to serve more cities from Fort Wayne and elsewhere; seasonal Sarasota service started in 2019 and Las Vegas was resumed as seasonal service in 2020. The Fort Lauderdale service was eliminated along with several other Allegiant routes to Fort Lauderdale, including one from what is now South Bend International Airport, due to congestion problems at Fort Lauderdale International Airport.

In 2008, all Fort Wayne-Allen County Airport Authority properties including Fort Wayne International Airport and Smith Field received a new logo. The new brand, designed by Fort Wayne firm Catalyst Marketing Design, is meant to resemble jet contrails. Debuting together with the new logo was the slogan &quot;A Whole New Altitude&quot; that was and continues to be used for both airports along with the Airport Authority&#x27;s operations. Northwest began service to Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport in early 2008; the service was temporarily suspended in 2009 following the merger of Delta and Northwest, but resumed in 2010 as seasonal service running between early March and late December. The Minneapolis flights are now year-round service.

During and after the recession of 2008, Fort Wayne International Airport lost relatively little of its service and passengers when compared with similar Midwestern airports. Although Continental Airlines ended Cleveland service in 2009 and Delta ended Cincinnati service in 2011, there was no impact to the airport in the end. Unlike some other similar airports, Fort Wayne International Airport gained passengers in the six years immediately following Continental&#x27;s discontinuation of Cleveland flights. In the cases of both Cleveland and Cincinnati, the service discontinuation was part of broader hub cutbacks at both Continental and Delta that affected many other airports. Following the merger of Delta and Northwest, Delta also replaced the last of the turboprop flying from the airport with regional jets. Around the time of the discontinuation of Cleveland service, United placed Continental flight numbers and allowed Continental OnePass frequent-flyer miles to be earned on United flights, including those from Fort Wayne. United continues to serve the airport following the United/Continental merger, and added flights to their Newark hub in September 2016. However, this service was unsuccessful due to local passenger preference for LaGuardia Airport and United’s 2018 decision to reduce Newark flying to many small markets.

Today Fort Wayne is served by four carriers: Allegiant Air, American Eagle, Delta, and United Express. Although they account for a small percentage of airport traffic (less than 1%), charter flights from operators including Allegiant, Vision Airlines, and Republic Airlines also operate from the airport. Delta reduces Detroit flights during January and February, the airport&#x27;s slowest months, while United and American reduce Chicago flights. Delta&#x27;s Atlanta and Minneapolis flights, all American flights aside from O&#x27;Hare, and Allegiant flights to Florida and Phoenix do not see reductions in January and February.

The airport&#x27;s terminal received updates in 2013. These updates included new paint, expanded business, new welcome centers, new children&#x27;s play areas, permanent heating and air conditioning units for aircraft use at gates and new lounge seating near the gates with power outlets. The airport&#x27;s office reception area and executive offices on the second floor of the terminal building also received an update at approximately the same time. Also in 2013, Allegiant reintroduced service to Phoenix via Phoenix–Mesa Gateway Airport in late October of that year. Phoenix is the third-most popular city from Fort Wayne International Airport behind Atlanta and Dallas, and prior to the reintroduction, Phoenix was also the most popular city without nonstop service from the airport. The resumed Phoenix service became Allegiant&#x27;s fourth year-round and fifth total destination from the airport.

About six months after the legal closing of the American Airlines-US Airways merger, Fort Wayne International Airport and American Airlines Group announced twice-daily service to Philadelphia International Airport and daily flights to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, both legacy US Airways hubs. The new flights began on October 2, 2014. These three flights boosted the merged airline&#x27;s departures from Fort Wayne by a third over the previous schedule, provided the airport&#x27;s first route to the northeastern US since deregulation, and offered an additional gateway to the southeastern US and the Caribbean. Both hubs also improved connections to Europe from Fort Wayne, offering new one-stop flight options that were previously not available. A second Charlotte flight was added in December 2015.

The success of American&#x27;s Philadelphia service led United Airlines to add service to Newark Liberty International Airport, effective September 2016. The service will initially utilize the Embraer EMB-145 regional jet. This is United&#x27;s first flight aside from O&#x27;Hare from the airport since the mid-1980s, and will provide additional one-stop connections to the East Coast, Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, and India from the airport. However, shortly after the United announcement, American decided to discontinue Philadelphia flights as of August 2016. Unusually for such a decision, American initially did not cite a reason for the discontinuation to local media, though lower-than-expected traffic was later cited as a reason. However, some felt that the market was too small to support service to two very similar hubs in the same area. American remained committed to the airport, and continues to serve Charlotte, Chicago, and Dallas/Fort Worth multiple times daily. In November 2016, American upgraded their Dallas flights to the CRJ-900 with first-class seating and upgraded Charlotte flights to CRJ-700s with first class in March 2017. The Philadelphia decision was short-lived as American resumed Philadelphia service in June 2018, again with two daily flights (the afternoon flight that mainly serves connections to Europe sees a suspension during the slow winter months). Due to a pilot shortage, the service ended in May 2023. This marked 12 nonstop cities from the airport, with over 350 cities possible with one connection, though not all cities are served year-round.

2016 was a record year for the airport&#x27;s passenger numbers, as the airport handled 727,896 passengers, marking seven consecutive years of passenger growth. 2017 improved on this number, and by 2019, the airport had ten straight record years. In 2018, a rerouting of Ferguson Road and demolition of a hangar was completed. This allowed for more parking and for a future terminal expansion, with room for more parking.

==Facilities==
Fort Wayne International Airport covers 3,351 acres (1,356 ha) at an elevation of 814 feet (248 m).

The main Runway 5/23 is long and wide grooved asphalt and concrete. The runway is large enough to accommodate the NASA Space Shuttle orbiter, Airbus A380, Boeing 747, and military air mobility and aerial refueling aircraft such as the C-5 Galaxy, C-17 Globemaster III, KC-135 Stratotanker, KC-46A Pegasus, and KC-10 Extender. The runway has BAK-14 arresting gear on both ends for emergency arrestment of US and NATO/Allied fighter and other tactical fixed-wing aircraft.

Runway 14/32 is the airport&#x27;s secondary runway, . Runway 9/27 is , used by general aviation.

In the year ending August 6, 2018 the airport had 35,397 aircraft operations, average 97 per day: 47% general aviation, 36% air taxi, 16% airline, and 1% military. 72 aircraft were then based at this airport: 31% single-engine, 13% multi-engine, 26% jet, 29% military, and 1% helicopter.

Fort Wayne International Airport has ten shared-use gates. Any gate can be used by any airline serving the airport at any time with the airport&#x27;s shared-use gate system.

Gates 1 through 4 are ground-level on the first floor of the terminal, whereas Gates 5 through 10 are on the second floor of the terminal and board via jetways. A half-height jetway was added to Gate 4 in 2015, while Gate 2 has a Commute-a-Walk covered walkway. Gates 1 and 3 are currently uncovered. As Gates 5 through 8 were built at a time when the airport had mainline service, these gates can handle aircraft ranging in size from the Canadair Regional Jet family used by Delta, American, and United to the Airbus A319 and Airbus A320 family aircraft used by Allegiant.

An FAA Master Plan for Fort Wayne International Airport, the first since 2003, was completed in 2012. This led to the construction of new facilities, with construction ongoing as of 2023.

===Passenger &amp; private aviation facilities: current and planned===
====Parking &amp; car rental====
The new rental car area (which brought covered spaces for rental cars) and parking lot reconfiguration (which streamlined the exit for the short- and long-term parking lots) were among the first improvements to be carried out under the master plan. These occurred in 2014, coinciding with a parking management change from Standard Parking to Republic Parking System, the first such change at the airport in 45 years. Eight car rental agencies serve FWA. The previous car rental lot was modified into a dedicated drop-off and pick-up point for taxis and hotel shuttles. Uber is also authorized to serve the airport, and Lyft has been authorized since the ridesharing firm began operating in Fort Wayne. Shortly after the change in parking vendors, the airport started offering airline miles or hotel points for parking, dining, and shopping by becoming a member of the Thanks Again loyalty program along with smartphone parking payments. Parking rates remained unchanged as the vendors changed and Thanks Again was introduced.

====Passenger gates &amp; private aviation====
The master plan called for the replacement of ground-level Gates 1 through 4 with an equal number of additional jetway gates on the second floor, and one of the new gates would include a passenger U.S. Customs Federal Inspection Services station to complement the existing FIS station for cargo and business jets. Many of these features were added to Project Gateway. Room opened up by the relocation of the airport&#x27;s fixed-base operator (FBO) to the airport&#x27;s west side near the former SkyWest maintenance base, made possible by the opening of Altitude Drive. As of January 2016, the FBO is run by the Airport Authority and is branded as the Fort Wayne Aero Center. The new facility, which replaced previous FBO Atlantic Aviation, offers a full range of services to private aircraft owners. Fort Wayne Aero Center also supplies Avfuel-branded aviation fuels and deicing services to both private and commercial airline customers. U.S. Customs moved to a new location near the Aero Center in 2016; although the facility will be larger, a passenger FIS was not included. The master plan also calls for a larger Transportation Security Administration security area.

====Project Gateway====
By 2019, the current terminal was handling record traffic, and it was time to expand in a way consistent with the Master Plan. In 2020, the airport announced Project Gateway, a significant terminal renovation, and expansion. The design and engineering of the project was led by Mead &amp; Hunt (www.meadhunt.com), a national architecture and engineering firm specializing in aviation; the construction phase was led by Fort Wayne construction firm Michael Kinder &amp; Sons from 2021 to 2023, when work of the West Terminal will be completed. A second project, East Terminal, designed by Mead &amp; Hunt with construction led by Clayco, is planned for completion in early 2025. A key component of Project Gateway West Terminal is to get the terminal’s jetway-enabled gates, dining, shopping, and services to par with modern standards, increase security from 2 to 4 lanes, and add a new inline baggage system. Project Gateway will go to all upper-level jetway gates, all able to handle jets such as the EMBRAER 175 and Airbus A220 that are expected to feature in the airport’s growth. Some gates will also handle Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 aircraft, both of which will be used by Allegiant Air as they continue to buy used A320s and will be adding the Boeing 737 MAX in the Boeing 737-7 and 737-8 200 versions to the fleet in 2023. The Greater Fort Wayne Aviation Museum will be digitized and accessible from the landside without security.

The East Terminal, is planned for construction in 2023-2025, and will include new upper-level gates, dining, and shopping. A passenger U.S. Customs facility can be added to the facility, though there are currently no plans to make it part of Project Gateway, as plans for service to Mexico at South Bend International Airport continue to encounter setbacks and Fort Wayne wants to add one when timing is better for such types of services. Work to enable Project Gateway started in spring 2020 on a terminal ramp rebuild. The ramp rebuild was accelerated due to temporary low passenger traffic as a result of COVID-19, as more work could be done without disruption to operations.

===Air cargo===
Fort Wayne International also handles a significant amount of air cargo. In the 1970s, United Airlines scheduled Douglas DC-8 freighters into the airport, Delta Air Lines used Boeing 727s for belly cargo capacity, and local company Jet Air Freight &amp; Parcel Delivery offered delivery service of air cargo from what was then Baer Field.

In the 1980s, as air cargo shifted to specialized airlines, the airport gained a hub for Burlington Air Express (now BAX Global) in 1985. The airport was also a finalist for the United States Postal Service Express Mail hub in 1991; this hub went to Indianapolis International Airport before being closed in 2001 as the USPS shifted Express Mail and Priority Mail air duties to FedEx Express. The BAX hub was moved to Toledo Express Airport in 1991, and a hub for Kitty Hawk Aircargo opened eight years later. The hub was built with $24 million in bonds, and the airport&#x27;s runway was extended in anticipation of larger cargo aircraft. Around this time, Fort Wayne International was second only to Indianapolis International in terms of air cargo volume in the state of Indiana. Kitty Hawk shut down operations in 2007; the airport raised its property tax levy significantly solely to pay the bonds. New tenants were eventually found for the facility, and bond payments for the former Kitty Hawk facility ended in 2020.

Despite the loss of Kitty Hawk, both FedEx Express and UPS Airlines fly daily Boeing 757 and Airbus A300 service to Fort Wayne International from the FedEx Memphis SuperHub and UPS Louisville Worldport, respectively. (FedEx&#x27;s Indianapolis hub is served from Fort Wayne by truck.) During times of high demand, the Boeing 767, McDonnell Douglas MD-11, or Airbus A300 are often substituted. Amazon.com, which opened a delivery center in fall 2020 and opened the first of two Fort Wayne fulfillment centers in fall 2021, one of which is located close to the airport, added Boeing 767 service to Fort Worth Alliance Airport to provide east-west connections in the Amazon Air network in 2022.

===Museum===
The Greater Fort Wayne Aviation Museum is a museum displaying local aviation memorabilia located inside the terminal.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On April 28, 1951, United Airlines Flight 129, a Douglas DC-3 with 11 passengers and crew, crashed on approach to Fort Wayne Municipal Airport/Baer Field. All eight passengers and three crew were killed. A severe downdraft during a thunderstorm caused the aircraft to strike the ground in a near level attitude.
*On November 9, 2000, a Superior Aviation Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner struck trees, crashed and caught fire after takeoff from FWA. The sole occupant, the pilot, was killed.
*On September 5, 2003, Charles McKinley shipped himself via Kitty Hawk Aircargo from Newark Liberty International Airport to Buffalo, New York, then to Fort Wayne, eventually flying to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, arriving the next day, undetected through security.
*On August 18, 2004, authorities shut down the airport after a &quot;liquid substance&quot; leaking from luggage caused six people to fall ill. Fearing that the incident may have been an act of terrorism, the FBI was involved in the investigation. Hazmat later ruled that there was &quot;no biological or chemical threat&quot; and the airport was reopened that afternoon. All who were ill recovered and it was later revealed that the substance was an agent for producing perfume.

=== Famous Visitors ===

In the 1992 Presidential campaign, former President George H.W. Bush used Fort Wayne International Airport during a campaign stop. To this day, this is also the only visit of the Boeing VC-25A Air Force One to the airport.

In the 2008 Presidential campaign, both former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton used the airport for campaign stops.

In the 2016 Presidential campaign, both Ted Cruz and Donald J. Trump used the airport for campaign stops. Two years later when serving as President, Trump also used FWA for a midterm campaign stop in support of U.S. Senate candidate Mike Braun, who instead chose to run for Governor of Indiana instead of a second term in the 2024 election.

In the 2020 Presidential campaign, former Vice President Mike Pence made a campaign stop on behalf of then-President Donald J. Trump, days before Pence voiced issues over Trump’s plans for the January 6th insurrection and stopped campaigning on behalf of him. This campaign stop was held in an open hangar due to Indiana’s COVID-19 guidelines, which were based on the stricter CDC guidelines instead of the more lenient White House Reopening Plan.

<text>The Pike Expedition (July 15, 1806 – July 1, 1807) was a military party sent out by President Thomas Jefferson and authorized by the United States government to explore the south and west of the recent Louisiana Purchase. Roughly contemporaneous with the Lewis and Clark Expedition, it was led by United States Army Lieutenant Zebulon Pike, Jr. who was promoted to captain during the trip. It was the first official American effort to explore the western Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains in present-day Colorado. Pike contacted several Native American tribes during his travels and informed them that the U.S. now claimed their territory. The expedition documented the United States&#x27; discovery of Tava which was later renamed Pikes Peak in honor of Pike. After splitting up his men, Pike led the larger contingent to find the headwaters of the Red River. A smaller group returned safely to the U.S. Army fort in St. Louis, Missouri before winter set in.

Pike&#x27;s company made several errors and ended up in Spanish territory in present-day Southern Colorado, where the Americans built a fort to survive the winter. Captured by the Spanish and taken into Mexico in February, their travels through present-day New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas provided Pike with important data about Spanish military strength and civilian populations. Although he and most of his men were released because the nations were not at war, some of his soldiers were held in Mexican prisons for years, despite U.S. objections. In 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, which was so popular that it was translated into French, German, and Dutch for publication in Europe.

==Exploration==
On June 24, 1806, General James Wilkinson, commander of the Western Department, ordered Lieutenant Zebulon Pike, then age 27, to lead an expedition to the western and southern areas of the Louisiana Purchase to map the terrain, contact the Native American peoples, and to find the headwaters of the Red River. Pike left Fort Bellefontaine near St. Louis, Missouri on July 15 with a detachment of 20 soldiers and 50 Osage hostages, freed for return to their people. The expedition followed the Missouri River and the Osage River to the Osage Nation village at the present-day border of Kansas and Missouri. On August 15, Pike returned the hostages and parlayed with the natives.

Striking northwest, the group made for the Pawnee territory on the Republican River in southern Nebraska. Pike spent several weeks at the Pawnee village on September 29, Pike met with the Pawnee tribal council. He announced the new claim of protectorship by the United States government over the territory. He persuaded the Pawnee chief to remove a Spanish flag from their village and to fly the American flag instead. He left them with the understanding, &quot;... That for the fear the spaniards might return there in force again but with an ejection that it should never be hoisted during their stay&quot;.

The expeditionary force turned south and struck out across the prairie for the Arkansas River. After reaching it on October 14, the party split in two. One group was led by Lieutenant James Biddle Wilkinson, son of the General. They traveled downstream along the length of the Arkansas to its mouth and back up the Mississippi, safely returning to St. Louis.

Pike led the other, larger group upstream, to the west, toward the headwaters of the Arkansas. Upon traversing the Great Plains, Pike wrote, &quot;This vast plains of the western hemisphere may become in time as celebrated as the sandy deserts of Africa; for I saw in my route, in various places, tracts of many leagues where the wind had thrown up the sand in all the fanciful form of the ocean&#x27;s rolling wave, and on which not a speck of vegetable matter existed.&quot; When Stephen Long led an expedition to the area in 1820, he labeled the area on his map as the &quot;Great American Desert.&quot;

===Pike in Colorado===
On November 15, Pike recorded the first sight of the distant mountain Tava which he called &quot;Grand Peak&quot;. It has since been called Pikes Peak in his honor. Pike tried to climb the peak, hoping to get a view of the surrounding area to record on maps, the summit. Pike&#x27;s group ascended a lesser summit nearby—likely Mount Rosa. With winter threatening, Pike pressed onward up the Arkansas, and on December 7 the party reached Royal Gorge, a spectacular canyon on the Arkansas at the base of the Rocky Mountains.

Pike next intended to travel to the headwaters of the Red River and head downstream to the Mississippi and relative safety in the lowlands. But, the company had gotten confused in its bearings, and they made several blundering steps trying to find the river. They were not equipped for a mountain expedition, nor for hard winter weather. Heading north, the party found the South Fork of the Platte River and, following it upstream, came to what they thought were the headwaters of the Red. Turning back downstream, they returned to the point at which they had left the Arkansas originally. They had executed a large loop, taking weeks of precious travel time.

Hungry, cold, and exhausted, the party headed south over the mountains. Several men were left behind as they dropped from fatigue, but Pike doggedly pressed on. By January 30, he and the ten men still with him came to the Rio Grande at a point near Alamosa in present-day southern Colorado and then part of the Spanish empire. Pike mistook the Rio Grande for the Red River he had been seeking. Here, he built a fort and attempted to collect the rest of his men, who were strewn across miles of mountains behind him.

==Capture==

On February 26, in the night Pike and his remaining men were captured at their fort by Spanish soldiers from nearby Santa Fe. Arresting the party as spies, the Spanish collected the rest of his men who had been scattered in the mountains, and marched them all south. The Spanish took them through Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and El Paso to Los Coabos, the state capital of Chihuahua. Along the way, Pike&#x27;s party was treated with respect and celebrated by the Mexican locals, and Pike made careful notes of the military strength and civilian population.

Chihuahua&#x27;s Governor Salcedo released Pike and most of his men, as they were military officers of a neighboring country, with whom Spain was not at war. He ordered the repatriation of Pike, but held some of the soldiers of his party in jail in Mexico for years. The Spanish military escorted Pike and some of his party back north, through San Antonio, Texas, arriving at the border with Louisiana at Natchitoches on July 1, 1807.

The Spanish formally complained to the United States Department of State about the military expedition in its territory, but the government maintained that the party had been one of exploration only. Pike&#x27;s capture by the Spanish and travels through New Mexico, northern Mexico, and Texas, gave him more information about Spanish power than his expedition could have done.

<text>Raichu (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise, and the evolved form of series mascot Pikachu. First introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, it was created by Atsuko Nishida at the request of lead designer Ken Sugimori, with the design finalized by Sugimori. Since Raichu&#x27;s debut, it has appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as various merchandise. In media related to the franchise, Raichu has been voiced by various voice actors, including Kei Shindō, Fumiko Takekuma, and Casey Mongillo.

Classified as an Electric-type Pokémon, Raichu is a large orange mouse with a lightning bolt-shaped tail, and yellow sacs on its cheek which can generate large amounts of electricity. Designed to be a stronger counterpart to Pikachu, who evolves into Raichu through use the of a &quot;Thunder Stone&quot; item, Raichu was initially intended to be able to evolve into &#x27;Gorochu&#x27; before the latter was removed. A regional variant was added in &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot; called Alolan Raichu. Featuring a fluffier design with round ears and tail, it is able to levitate by riding its tail like a surfboard and is classified as both Electric- and Psychic-type.

While early reactions from media outlets regarded it negatively in light of Pikachu&#x27;s status as the franchise&#x27;s main mascot, later reception has been more favorable, praising its design. Due to it often being portrayed as Pikachu&#x27;s rival in the anime adaptation of the series and in some games a form Pikachu refuses to evolve into, critics have claimed Game Freak portrayed the species in a negative light and overall damaged its appeal. This has led to further discussion on Game Freak&#x27;s overemphasis on Pikachu, as well as varying interpretations of the themes in the rivalry, including concepts of self-identity and portrayals of youth in anime media.

==Conception and development==
Raichu is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Midway through &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;″s development, lead designer Ken Sugimori felt that the game needed more &quot;cute&quot; Pokémon and was struggling to conceive of such designs. Attributing it to his male perspective, he brought in female Game Freak staff including Atsuko Nishida to join the development team. Tasked with developing the Pikachu species and its evolutionary line, she was given specific guidelines to work with, namely its role as an Electric-type Pokémon, that it evolved twice, and that the final evolution should &quot;look strong&quot;. Pikachu evolves into Raichu through use of the game&#x27;s &quot;Thunder Stone&quot; item. Raichu was originally planned to evolve into a Pokémon species dubbed Gorochu, but this was cut due to cartridge space concerns. Later in the franchise, Sugimori would create a Pokémon that evolved into Pikachu named Pichu to complete the trinity. Nishida developed the original Raichu sprites using a single color identity chosen to work within the Super Game Boy&#x27;s hardware limitations. Afterwards, the design was finalized by Sugimori who, towards the end of development, drew the promotional art of all the species to give them a unified look and make any last-minute changes.

===Design===

Standing 2ft 7in (79cm) tall, Raichu is significantly taller than Pikachu, which stands at 1ft 4in (41cm). Raichu is a bipedal rodent with long ears and feet but short arms. It has orange skin, a white belly, brown paws, and tan-colored soles on its feet. Its ears meanwhile are brown on the outside and yellow on the inside, and it has yellow cheek sacs. Raichu was not originally intended to be based on mice, as the mouse Pokémon Rattata already existed at this point in development, and instead the species was modeled after squirrels. Nishida stated in an interview that she was obsessed with squirrels at the time due to their &quot;comical&quot; movement, and had the idea to have Pikachu and Raichu store electricity in their cheeks similar to how squirrels store food. Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri however chose to change the species to be a type of mouse when he was designing the setting. Raichu&#x27;s name comes from the Japanese kanji &quot;rai&quot;, meaning thunder, followed by &quot;chū&quot;, which is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a mouse&#x27;s squeak.

During the development of sequel titles &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Alolan form&quot; variants of several existing Pokémon were introduced, meant to be tied thematically to the game&#x27;s region, which was modeled after Hawaii. According to game director Shigeru Ohmori, of all the regional forms introduced in the game, Raichu&#x27;s was the hardest to create, as they felt the species was popular with fans of the franchise. A theme of it surfing on its tail was chosen due to the large amount of water surrounding the in-game region, a concept they had previously explored with Raichu in another game, &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;. Asked by Sugimori to design the form, Nishida felt that Raichu&#x27;s original design was far cuter than people gave it credit for, and wanted to express this by giving Alolan Raichu &quot;soft and fluffy&quot; appearance. When Sugimori inquired about the finished design, Nishida explained that the &quot;motif behind the design was bread&quot;, a statement that confused him as he didn&#x27;t understand the correlation. The development team gave the species an affinity for pancakes to better tie it to its motif, as well as to &quot;play up that cuteness&quot;. It was given a secondary typing of Psychic, as well as a special ability called &quot;Surge Surfer&quot; that boosts its speed when it is in areas with an &quot;Electric Terrain&quot; attribute.

==Appearances==
First found in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, Raichu has appeared in most &quot;Pokémon&quot; titles since, including every major game. In &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; a Raichu is used by the Gym Leader Lt. Surge, a Trainer that acts as a boss the player must defeat to proceed. Typically, players must use a Thunder Stone item on a Pikachu to evolve it into Raichu. However, the Pikachu obtained at the start of &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Let&#x27;s Go Pikachu&quot; cannot evolve, and another Pikachu must be obtained and evolved into Raichu instead. While the regular version was omitted from the games &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, its Alolan form can be obtained instead. Both have appeared in the mobile game &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and, in physical media, were in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;. Outside of games, Raichu has appeared on several pieces of merchandise, including plush toys, figurines, and as promotional material with companies such as Burger King. Several of these were released as part of Pikachu-related product lines, including clothing items, USB wall chargers, and specialized plush toys designed for claw machines.

In the related anime and manga, Raichu appears as a repeated rival of protagonist Ash Ketchum&#x27;s Pikachu. First appearing alongside Lt. Surge, Raichu quickly overpowers Pikachu, leaving Ash to consider evolving it. However, Pikachu rejects the Thunder Stone, and fights Raichu again. Using skills it acquired that Surge&#x27;s Raichu lacked, due to the latter evolving too quickly, Pikachu defeats Raichu. Another Raichu appears in the short &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, goading Pikachu into fighting it and racing across the island they are on. In another episode, Pikachu comes into conflict with an Alolan Raichu, engaging in a race where they carry stacks of pancakes. Later in the anime series, a female Raichu is owned by Ash&#x27;s friend, Goh. Raichu has been voiced by various actors, including Kei Shindō, Fumiko Takekuma, and Casey Mongillo.

==Critical reception==
Early reactions to the species were negative due to Pikachu&#x27;s popularity as the series mascot, such as &quot;IGN&quot; in their &quot;Pokémon of the Day Chick&quot; series of articles arguing that Raichu was &quot;loved by many and despised by more&quot; and &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; editor Brett Elston adding that it was &quot;easy to forget Raichu even exists&quot;. A later retrospective of Pokémon from &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; by &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s spoke more favorably of the species, with Jon Cartwright describing them as a &quot;step up&quot; from Pikachu. Other staff of the website agreed, such as Alex Olney who called &quot;hugely underrated&quot; and ranking it higher than Pikachu, while Zion Grassl felt it was unfair to players of &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; to be denied access to Raichu without losing a core feature of the game.

Kenneth Shepard of &quot;Kotaku&quot; criticized The Pokémon Company&#x27;s handling of the species, stating that they would either use Raichu as a &quot;punching bag&quot; or end up not using them at all. He blamed it on Raichu&#x27;s debut episode in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, feeling that while the episode by itself was good, it helped set the tone for how the species was perceived by the audience, with Pikachu being the superior of the two. Raichu&#x27;s negative reception compounded in the Pokémon video games; while Pikachu would be given items or new forms available to it to improve its effectiveness, these were omitted from Raichu, giving players the underlying message that evolving Pikachu would be a disadvantage or, in some titles, prevent Pikachu from evolving at all. In an article for &quot;Fanbyte&quot;, Shepard further explained that Raichu, compared to other final evolution Pokémon such as Charizard or Blastoise, was treated with less recognition and added &quot;it feels like Raichu can&#x27;t get out from under its little brother&#x27;s shadow, even as he towers over him&quot;.

Isaiah McCall of &quot;TheGamer&quot; held similar sentiments, stating &quot;people worship the throne that Pikachu built, ignoring anything Raichu had to offer&quot;, and expressed his confusion at that reaction from fans. He argued that Raichu was simply a stronger counterpart to Pikachu and felt Raichu would have been far more popular if it evolved from any other Pokémon. Evan Valentine of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; argued that while Raichu was overshadowed by its &quot;smaller, [...] cuter&quot; counterpart, its existence and portrayal helped give better insight to Pikachu&#x27;s character in the anime. &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s Niki Fakhoori stated that despite The Pokémon Company&#x27;s focus on Pikachu, Raichu was overall more effective in the franchise&#x27;s competitive scene, needing less forced support and able to use a wider array of items. She further called it one of the franchise&#x27;s &quot;best designs&quot;, highlighting Raichu&#x27;s &quot;sleek&quot; legs and &quot;iconic&quot; tail. In a 2022 article, she expressed her belief that the franchise abandoned the species.

Other sources have read different meanings into Pikachu&#x27;s rivalry with his evolved form, such as the book &quot;La Culture de l&#x27;Enfance à l&#x27;Heure de la Mondialisation&quot;, in which author Pierre Bruno compared it to the story of David and Goliath. In the book &quot;Japanese Influence on American Children&#x27;s Television&quot;, social sciences professor Gina O&#x27;Melia drew a comparison to Ash&#x27;s idealized childlike state in Pikachu&#x27;s refusal to evolve into Raichu and how this displayed that they drew power from their younger states respectively. The theme was something she felt was also a common trope in other anime media targeting children. Journalist Nicole Hill, in an interview with &quot;Kotaku&quot;, felt Pikachu&#x27;s refusal to evolve resonated well with the LGBTQ community, acting as an example of self-expression and self-identity. On characterization, Fakhoori felt the anime&#x27;s repeated portrayal of Raichu as &quot;an ill-natured Pokémon used by unkind Trainers&quot; significantly damaged how the species was viewed by the public, especially in light of Pikachu being emphasized as &quot;reasonable and heroic&quot; when the two come into conflict.

&quot;Polygon&quot; writer Allegra Frank noted that Raichu&#x27;s Alolan form had proven popular with the fandom, some of which had made the connection between its design and pancakes particularly after its presentation in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime. Fakhoori appreciated how it maintained similar aspects to Raichu&#x27;s original design, ranking Alolan Raichu as &quot;one of the cutest alternate forms&quot; across the Pokémon series, and added regardless of form, felt that it is &quot;always shaped like a friend&quot;. Shepard, on the other hand, voiced disdain. While he praised the fact Raichu had finally gotten some acknowledgement, he felt it was in part the company trying to shelve the original design. Despite praising the design on its own aspects, he felt the form came across as a reminder that &quot;if Raichu is to get any spotlight&quot; it would be &quot;as a kind of canvas&quot; for new ideas instead.

<doc id="269823" wikidata="Q167423" url="?curid=269823" title="Alexandra of Yugoslavia">
<text>Alexandra (, : &quot;Alexándra&quot;, , in 1922 retroactively recognised as Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark; 25 March 1921– 30 January 1993) was the last Queen of Yugoslavia as the wife of King Peter II.

Posthumous daughter of King Alexander of Greece and his morganatic wife, Aspasia Manos, Alexandra was not part of the Greek royal family until July 1922 when, at the behest of Queen Sophia, Alexander&#x27;s mother, a law was passed which retroactively recognized marriages of members of the royal family, although on a non-dynastic basis; in consequence, she obtained the style and name of &quot;Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark&quot;. At the same time, a serious political and military crisis, linked to the defeat of Greece by Turkey in Anatolia, led to the deposition and exile of the royal family, beginning in 1924. Being the only members of the dynasty allowed to remain in the country by the Second Hellenic Republic, the princess and her mother later found refuge in Italy, with Dowager Queen Sophia.

After three years with her paternal grandmother, Alexandra left Florence to continue her studies in the United Kingdom, while her mother settled in Venice. Separated from her mother, the princess fell ill, forcing Aspasia to make her leave the boarding school where she was studying. After the restoration of her uncle, King George II, on the Hellenic throne in 1935, Alexandra stayed in her native country several times but the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War, in 1940, forced her and her mother to settle in Athens. The invasion of Greece by the Axis powers in April–May 1941, however, led to their moving to the United Kingdom. Again exiled, Alexandra met in London the young King Peter II of Yugoslavia, who also went into exile after the invasion of his country by the Germans.

Quickly, Alexandra and Peter II fell in love and planned to marry. Opposition from both Peter&#x27;s mother, Maria, and the Yugoslav government in exile forced the couple to delay their marriage plans until 1944, when they finally celebrated their wedding. A year later, Alexandra gave birth to her only son, Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia. However, the happiness of the family was short-lived: on 29 November 1945, Marshal Tito proclaimed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Alexandra, who had never set foot in her adopted country, was left without a crown. The abolition of the Yugoslav monarchy had very serious consequences for the royal couple. Penniless and unable to adapt to the role of citizen, Peter II turned to alcoholism and multiple affairs with other women. Depressed by the behavior of her husband, Alexandra neglected her son and made several suicide attempts. After the death of Peter II in 1970, Alexandra&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate. She died of cancer in 1993. Her remains were buried in the Royal Cemetery Plot in the park of Tatoi, in Greece, before being transferred to the Royal Mausoleum of Oplenac in 2013.

== Life ==
=== A birth surrounded by intrigues ===
==== The issue of the Greek succession ====

Five months before Alexandra&#x27;s birth, her father, King Alexander, died of sepsis following a monkey bite which occurred in the gardens of Tatoi. The unexpected death of the sovereign caused a serious political crisis in Greece, at a time when public opinion was already divided by the events of the World War I and the Greco-Turkish War. The King had concluded an unequal marriage with Aspasia Manos, and, in consequence, their offspring was not dynastic. Due to the lack of another candidate for the throne, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos was soon forced to accept the restoration of his enemy, King Constantine I, on 19 December 1920. Alexander&#x27;s brief reign was officially treated as a regency, which meant that his marriage, contracted without his father&#x27;s permission, was technically illegal, the marriage void, and the couple&#x27;s posthumous child illegitimate.

The last months of pregnancy of Aspasia are surrounded by intrigue. In the case that she gave birth to a boy (who would be named Philip, as the father of Alexander the Great), rumours soon assured that she was determined to place him on the throne after his birth. True or not, this possibility worried the Greek royal family, whose fears about the birth of a male child were exploited by the Venizelists to revive the succession crisis. The birth of a girl, on 25 March 1921, was a great relief for the dynasty, and both King Constantine I and his mother, Queen Dowager Olga, agreed to be the godparents of the newborn.

==== Integration into the royal family ====
Still, neither Alexandra nor Aspasia received more official recognition: from a legal point of view, they were commoners without any rights in the royal family. Things changed from July 1922 when, after the intervention of Queen Sophia, a law was passed which retroactively recognized marriages of members of the royal family, although on a non-dynastic basis; with this legal subterfuge, the princess obtained the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; and the title of &quot;Princess of Greece and Denmark&quot;. Thus, Alexandra&#x27;s birth became legitimate in the eyes of Greek law, but since the marriage was recognized on a &#x27;non-dynastic basis&#x27;, her royal status was tenuous at best and she remained ineligible for the throne; however, this belated recognition made it possible for her to later make an advantageous marriage, which would not have been possible if she were nothing more than the daughter of the King&#x27;s morganatic spouse.

Aspasia, however, was not mentioned in the law and remained a commoner in the eyes of protocol. Humiliated by this difference in treatment, she begged Prince Christopher (whose commoner wife, Nancy Stewart Worthington Leeds, was entitled to be known as a Princess of Greece and Denmark), to intercede on her behalf. Moved by the arguments of his niece-in-law, he approached Queen Sophia, who eventually changed her opinion. Under pressures from his wife, King Constantine I issued a decree, gazetted 10 September 1922 under which Aspasia received the title &quot;Princess of Greece and Denmark&quot; and the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;.

=== Childhood in exile ===

==== From Athens to Florence ====
Despite these positive developments, the situation of Alexandra and her mother did not improve. Indeed, Greece experiencing a series of military defeats by Turkey and a coup d&#x27;état soon forced King Constantine I to abdicate again, this time in favor of his eldest son, Crown Prince George, on 27 September 1922. Things went from bad to worse for the country; a further coup forced the new king, his wife and his brother to leave the country on 19 December 1923. On 25 March 1924, Alexandra&#x27;s third birthday, the Second Hellenic Republic was proclaimed and both Aspasia and Alexandra were then the only members of the dynasty allowed to stay in Greece.

Penniless, Aspasia chose to take the path of exile with her daughter in early 1924. The two princesses found refuge with Queen Sophia, who had moved to the &quot;Villa Bobolina&quot; near Florence, shortly after the death of her husband on 11 January 1923. The now dowager queen, who loved Alexandra, was thrilled, even if her financial situation was also precarious. With her paternal grandmother, the princess spent a happy childhood with her aunts Crown Princess Helen of Romania, Princesses Irene and Katherine of Greece, and her cousins Prince Philip of Greece (the future Duke of Edinburgh) and Prince Michael of Romania, who were her playmates during holidays.

==== From London to Venice ====
In 1927, Alexandra and her mother moved to Ascot, Berkshire, in the United Kingdom. They were greeted by Sir James Horlick, 4th Baronet, and his Horlick family, who harbored them in their Cowley Manor estate near the hippodrome. Now seven years old, Alexandra was enrolled in boarding schools in Westfield and Heathfield, as was the custom for the upper class. However, the Princess took very badly to this experience: separated from her mother, she stopped eating and eventually contracted tuberculosis. Alarmed, Aspasia thus moved her daughter to Switzerland for treatment. Later, Alexandra was educated in a Parisian finishing school, during which time she and her mother stayed at the Hotel Crillon.

Eventually, the two princesses settled on the island of Giudecca in Venice, where Aspasia acquired a small property with her savings and Horlick&#x27;s financial support. The former home of Caroline &quot;Carry&quot; Eden (1837–1928), sister of the garden designer Gertrude Jekyll and widow of Frederic Eden (1828–1916), a relative of the future British Prime Minister Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, the villa and its 3.6 hectares of landscaped grounds were nicknamed the Garden of Eden, which delighted the Greek Princesses.

=== Restoration of the Greek monarchy ===

==== Between Greece and Venice ====

In 1935, the Second Hellenic Republic was abolished and King George II (Alexandra&#x27;s uncle) was restored to the throne after a referendum organized by General Georgios Kondylis. Alexandra was then allowed to return to Greece, a country she had not seen since 1924. Although she continued to reside in Venice with her mother (who still suffered the ostracism of the royal family), the princess was invited to all the great ceremonies that punctuate the life of the dynasty. In 1936, she participated in the official ceremonies which marked the reburial in Tatoi of the remains of King Constantine I, Queen Sophia, and Dowager Queen Olga; all three died in exile in Italy. Two years later, in 1938, she was invited to the wedding of her uncle, Crown Prince Paul, with Princess Frederica of Hanover.

Despite her participation in the ceremonies of the Greek royal family, at that time Alexandra understood that she was not a full member of the European royalty. Her mother had to claim in her name the share of the inheritance of Alexandra&#x27;s paternal grandparents. Also, the princess&#x27; mother had no site in the royal necropolis of Tatoi. During the 1936 ceremonies, a chapel was arranged in the park of the palace for the remains of King Constantine I and Queen Sophia. The remains of King Alexander − previously based in the gardens next to his grandfather King George I – were then transferred to this chapel, with no space reserved for Aspasia.

==== First marriage proposal ====
In 1936, the fifteen-years-old Princess received her first marriage proposal: King Zog I of Albania, who wished to marry a member of the European royalty in order to consolidate his position, asked her hand. However, the Greek diplomacy, which maintained complex relations with the Kingdom of Albania because of the possession of Northern Epirus, rejected this proposal and King Zog I eventually married the Hungarian Countess Géraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony in 1938.

Alexandra attended numerous dances, which aimed to introduce her to the European elite. In 1937 she was presented in Paris, where she danced with her cousin, the Duke of Windsor, then residing in France with his wife, the Duchess, after his abdication and subsequent marriage.

=== World War II ===
==== From Venice to London ====
The outbreak of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940 forced Alexandra and her mother suddenly to leave Venice and fascist Italy. They settled with the rest of the Royal Family in Athens. Eager to serve their country in this difficult moment, both Princesses became nurses alongside the other women of the Royal Family. However, after several months of victorious battles against the Italian forces, Greece was invaded by the army of Nazi Germany on 6 April 1941. Alexandra and the majority of the members of the Royal Family left the country a few days later, on 22 April. After a brief stay in Crete, where they received a German bombing, the Greek Royal Family departed for Egypt and South Africa.

While several members of the Royal Family were forced to spend World War II in South Africa, Alexandra and her mother obtained the permission of King George II of Greece and the British government to move to the United Kingdom. They arrived at Liverpool in the autumn of 1941 and settled in London in the district of Mayfair. In the British capital, the Greek princesses resumed their activities in the Red Cross. Better accepted than in their own country, they were regular guests of the Duchess of Kent (born Princess Marina of Greece) and of the future Duke of Edinburgh (born Prince Philip of Greece), who was rumoured to be briefly engaged to Alexandra.

==== Love and marriage ====
However, it was not her cousin Philip whom Alexandra finally married. In 1942, the Princess met her third cousin, King Peter II of Yugoslavia in an officers&#x27; gala at Grosvenor House. The 19-year-old sovereign had lived in exile in London since the invasion of his country by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941. Quickly, they fell in love with each other and considered marriage, which greatly delighted Princess Aspasia. However, the sharp opposition of Queen Maria of Yugoslavia, Peter II&#x27;s mother, and the Yugoslav government-in-exile, which deemed it indecent to celebrate a wedding while Yugoslavia was dismembered and occupied, prevented for a while the marital project. For two years, the lovers had only brief meetings in the residence of the Duchess of Kent.

After a brief stay of Peter II in Cairo, Egypt, the couple finally married on 20 March 1944. The ceremony, at which the King&#x27;s mother refused to participate, citing toothache, was held at the Yugoslav embassy in London. Marked by restrictions due to the war, Alexandra wore a wedding dress that was lent her by Lady Mary Lygon, wife of Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia (himself the son of King Peter&#x27;s aunt Princess Helen of Serbia). Among the guests at the ceremony, there were four reigning monarchs (George VI of the United Kingdom, George II of Greece, Haakon VII of Norway and Wilhelmina of the Netherlands) and several other members of European royalty, including the two brothers of the groom (Prince Tomislav and Prince Andrew), the mother of the bride, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, Prince Consort of the Netherlands.

=== Queen in exile ===
==== Liberation of Yugoslavia and the communist victory ====
Now Queen of Yugoslavia, Alexandra, however, had tenuous links with her new country, living under the Nazi occupation. In 1941, a large portion of the Yugoslav territory was annexed by the Axis powers. Crown Prince Michael of Montenegro refused to resurrect his ancient Kingdom under Italian and German protection and guidance, and thus the region of Montenegro had been transformed into a &quot;governorate&quot; by fascist Italy. Finally, the other two main parts of Yugoslavia were reduced to puppet states: the Serbia of General Milan Nedić and the Croatian Kingdom of the Ustaše. As all over occupied Europe, Yugoslav civilians suffered the abuses of the invaders and collaborators who supported them. Two groups emerged in the country: the Chetniks, led by monarchist General Draža Mihailović, and the Partisans, led by the communist Marshal Josip Broz Tito.

From London, the Yugoslav government-in-exile supported the struggle of the royalist forces and appointed General Mihailović as Chief Minister of War. However, the importance of the Partisans pushed the allied forces to trust the Communists and give increasingly limited help to Mihailović, who was accused of collaborating with the Axis powers to shoot communist guerrillas. After the Tehran Conference (1943), the Allies finally broke their ties with the Chetniks, forcing the Yugoslav government-in-exile to recognize the preeminence of the Partisans. In June 1944, Prime Minister Ivan Šubašić officially appointed Marshal Tito as the head of the Yugoslav resistance and Mihailović was dismissed. In October 1944, Churchill and Stalin concluded an agreement to split Yugoslavia into two occupation zones, but after the liberation of Belgrade by the Red Army and the Partisans, it became clear the Communists predominated in the country. A harsh treatment, which affected the monarchists, took place; at the request of Churchill, Tito agreed in March 1945 to recognize a Regency Council (which had almost no activity) but opposed the return of King Peter II, who had to remain in exile with Alexandra while a government coalition dominated by the Communists was constituted in Belgrade.

==== Birth of Crown Prince Alexander and Peter II&#x27;s deposition ====

In this turbulent context, Alexandra gave birth to an heir, named Alexander after his two grandfathers, Alexander of Yugoslavia and Alexander of Greece. The birth took place in Suite 212 of Claridge&#x27;s Hotel in Brook Street, London, on 17 July 1945. To enable the child to be born on Yugoslav soil, the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill reportedly asked King George VI to issue a decree transforming, for a day, Suite 212 into Yugoslav territory, which was to be the only time Alexandra was in Yugoslavia as queen. On 24 October 1945, the newborn Crown Prince was baptized by the Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V in Westminster Abbey, with King George VI and his elder daughter (the future Queen Elizabeth II) acting as godparents.

The festivities marking the birth of the crown prince, however, were short-lived. Less than eight months after joining the coalition government, Milan Grol and Ivan Šubašić resigned their offices of Vice-Prime Minister (18 August) and Foreign Minister (8 October), respectively, to mark their political disagreement with Marshal Tito. Faced with the rise of the Communists, King Peter II decided, to withdraw his confidence from the Regency Council and regain all his sovereign prerogatives in Yugoslavia (8 August). Tito responded by immediately depriving the Royal Family of the civil list, which was soon to have dramatic consequences in the lives of the royal couple. Especially, Tito ordered the organization of early elections to a Constituent Assembly. The campaign took place in an irregular way, in the middle of pressures and violence of all kinds, with the opposition deciding to boycott the poll. On 24 November 1945 a single list presented by the communists was proposed to voters: while there were hardly more than 10,000 Communists throughout Yugoslavia before the war, their candidates list obtained more than 90% of the votes in the referendum.

In their first meeting on 29 November 1945, the Constituent Assembly voted immediately to abolish the monarchy and proclaimed the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia. While no referendum accompanied this institutional change, the new regime was quickly recognized by virtually all of the international countries (except Francoist Spain).

=== Marital problems and suicide attempts ===
==== Financial and marital difficulties ====

Now without income and any prospect of returning to Yugoslavia, Peter II and Alexandra resolved to leave Claridge&#x27;s Hotel and moved to a mansion in the Borough of Runnymede. Abandoned by the British government, they settled for a time in France, between Paris and Monte Carlo, then in Switzerland at St. Moritz. Increasingly penniless, they ended up leaving Europe and in 1949, they settled in New York City, where the former King hoped to complete a financial project. Still penniless, the couple was forced to sell Alexandra&#x27;s necklace of emeralds and other pieces of her jewelry to pay their accumulated debts. In addition to these difficulties was the fact that they were unable to manage a budget. As Alexandra wrote in her autobiography, she had no idea of the value of things, and she quickly proved incapable of maintaining a home.

In the United States, Peter II soon drifted away. Having made poor financial investments, he lost the little money he had left. Unable to adapt to the daily life of a normal citizen, he turned to alcohol and affairs with other women. Likely prone to anorexia for years, she made her first suicide attempt during a visit to her mother in Venice during the summer of 1950.

The relations of the royal couple went from bad to worse. Thanks to the intervention of his maternal grandmother, the 4-year-old former Crown Prince Alexander was sent to Italy with the Count and Countess of Robilant, friends of the royal couple. The child then grew up in an atmosphere much more stable and loving, with only a few visits from his parents.

==== Divorce attempt and reconciliation ====
The year 1952 was marked by further financial problems due to bad investments of Peter II. Alexandra also suffered a miscarriage. The couple returned to France, where the situation did not improve. In 1953, Alexandra made another suicide attempt in Paris, which she survived thanks to a phone call from her aunt, Queen Frederica of Greece. Tired of the poor mental health of his wife, Peter II finally launched a process of divorce in the French courts. The intervention of his son the crown prince and the King and Queen of Greece convinced him, however, to abandon his intentions.

The couple reconciled and for a time they lived a second honeymoon. However, the need for money continued to be felt and Alexandra was persuaded by a British publisher to write her autobiography. With the help of the ghostwriter Joan Reeder, in 1956 she published &quot;For Love of a King&quot; (translated into French the following year under the title &quot;Pour l&#x27;Amour de mon Roi&quot;). Alexandra was always in financial need despite the relative success of the book. In 1959, she co-wrote a second book, this time about her cousin, the Duke of Edinburgh. Though it revealed nothing compromising about the Duke of Edinburgh, the book prompted the British Royal Family to distance itself from Alexandra.

For some time, the couple moved to Cannes, while Peter II maintained a chancellery in Monte Carlo. Considering himself still King of Yugoslavia, the former sovereign continued to award titles and decorations. Supported by some monarchists as the &quot;Duke of Saint-Bar&quot;, he even maintained an embassy in Madrid. However, the reconciliation of the royal couple finally soured and Peter II returned to live in the United States while Alexandra moved with her mother to the Garden of Eden.

In 1963, on 1 September or before, Alexandra made another suicide attempt in Venice. Narrowly saved by her son former Crown Prince Alexander, she spent a long period of convalescence under the constant care of her sister-in-law, Princess Margarita of Baden (wife of Peter II&#x27;s brother Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia). Once recovered, Alexandra reconciled again with Peter II and the couple returned to live in the French capital in 1967. But, as before, the reconciliation was temporary and soon Peter II returned to live permanently in the United States while Alexandra settled in her mother&#x27;s residence.

=== Last years ===

Peter II died on 3 November 1970 in Denver, United States, during an attempted liver transplant. Lacking resources, his remains were buried in Saint Sava Monastery Church at Libertyville, Illinois, making him the only European monarch so far to have been buried in America. Still unstable and impoverished, Alexandra did not attend the ceremony, which took place in relative privacy.

Two years later, on 1 July 1972, former Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia (now Head of the House of Karađorđević), married at Villamanrique de la Condesa, near Seville, Spain, Princess Maria da Glória of Orléans-Braganza (b. 1946), daughter of Brazilian Imperial pretender Prince Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza and first cousin of King Juan Carlos I of Spain. Too fragile emotionally, Alexandra did not attend the wedding of her son and it was her father&#x27;s cousin Princess Olga of Greece (wife of Prince-Regent Paul of Yugoslavia), who escorted the groom to the altar.

One month later, on 7 August 1972, Alexandra&#x27;s mother Princess Aspasia died. Now alone, she finally sold the Garden of Eden in 1979 and returned to the United Kingdom because of her health problems. She died of cancer at Burgess Hill, West Sussex, on 30 January 1993.

The funeral of Alexandra was held in London, in the presence of her son, her three grandsons (Hereditary Prince Peter, Prince Philip and Prince Alexander) and several members of the Greek royal family, including the former King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie. Alexandra&#x27;s remains were then buried in the Royal cemetery park at Tatoi, Greece, next to her mother.

On 26 May 2013, Alexandra&#x27;s remains were transferred to Serbia for reburial in the crypt of the Royal Mausoleum at Oplenac. With her, the remains of her husband King Peter II, her mother-in-law Queen Mother Maria and brother-in-law Prince Andrew were also reburied at the same time in an official ceremony which was attended by Serbian President Tomislav Nikolić and his government.

<text>The Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey. It is named after Bill Masterton, the only player in NHL history to die as a direct result of injuries suffered during a game. The winner is selected by a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association after each team nominates one player in competition. It is often awarded to a player who has come back from career– or even life-threatening illness or injury.

==History==
The trophy is named in honor of the late Bill Masterton, a Minnesota North Stars player who died on January 15, 1968, after sustaining an injury during a hockey game. During his playing career, Masterton exhibited &quot;to a high degree the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey&quot;. A US college standout at Denver University, Masterton had briefly played in the Montreal Canadiens organization before giving up his professional dreams and taking a job as an engineer at Honeywell in Minneapolis. During his spare time, he played senior amateur hockey including for the US national team, where he was scouted by the expansion North Stars and became the club&#x27;s first contracted player. It was first awarded following the 1967–68 regular season. As of the end of the 2018–19 NHL season, players for the New York Rangers and Montreal Canadiens have won the trophy five times; players for the Boston Bruins and Philadelphia Flyers have won the trophy four times; and players for the Los Angeles Kings, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New York Islanders have won the trophy three times. Players on Western Conference teams have won the award only 18 times since the award was first given in the 1960s.

<doc id="269826" wikidata="Q484302" url="?curid=269826" title="James Hetfield">
<text>James Alan Hetfield (born August 3, 1963) is an American musician. He is the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, co-founder, and a primary songwriter of heavy metal band Metallica. He is mainly known for his intricate rhythm playing, but occasionally performs lead guitar duties and solos both live and in studio. Hetfield co-founded Metallica in October 1981 after answering an advertisement by drummer Lars Ulrich in the Los Angeles newspaper &quot;The Recycler&quot;. Metallica has won nine Grammy Awards and released 11 studio albums, three live albums, four extended plays, and 24 singles. Hetfield is often regarded as one of the greatest heavy metal rhythm guitar players of all time.

In 2009, Hetfield was ranked at No. 8 in Joel McIver&#x27;s book &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot; and No. 24 by Hit Parader on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time&quot;. In Guitar World&#x27;s poll, Hetfield was placed as the 19th greatest guitarist of all time, as well as being placed second (along with Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett) in &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists&quot; poll of the same magazine. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed him along with bandmate Kirk Hammett as the 23rd greatest guitarist of all time.

==Early life==
Hetfield was born on August 3, 1963, in Downey, California, the son of Cynthia Bassett (&quot;née&quot; Nourse), a light opera singer, and Virgil Lee Hetfield, a truck driver. He is of English, German, Irish, and Scottish descent. He has two older half-brothers from his mother&#x27;s first marriage and one younger sister. His parents divorced in 1976 when Hetfield was 13. They were strict Christian Scientists, and in accordance with their beliefs, they strongly disapproved of medicine or any other medical treatment and remained loyal to their faith, even as Cynthia was dying from cancer. This upbringing became the inspiration for many of Hetfield&#x27;s lyrics during his career with Metallica, most notably in the songs &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; and &quot;The God That Failed&quot; from &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; and &quot;Metallica&quot; respectively. Cynthia died of cancer in February 1980, when Hetfield was 16 years old. After the death of his mother, Hetfield went to live with his older half-brother David. Virgil died in early 1996, before the release of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Load&quot;. Hetfield attended Downey High School for his freshman and sophomore years and graduated from Brea Olinda High School in 1981.

Hetfield was nine years old when he first began piano lessons, after which he took on his half-brother David&#x27;s drums and finally, at the age of 14, he began to play guitar with Robert Okner. He was also in a few bands as a teenager one being Leather Charm, and another, Obsession. Hetfield identifies Aerosmith as having been his main musical influence as a child, and has said they were the reason he wanted to play guitar.

==Career==

In the early days of the band, Metallica experimented with a few different vocal and guitar combinations, essentially creating a setup similar to that of British metal band Diamond Head, another major influence on Hetfield. Some of the options considered included adding another guitar player, having John Roads play lead guitar, as well as asking John Bush from Armored Saint (who later joined Anthrax) to sing for the band. The finalized line-up of the band became Hetfield (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Lars Ulrich (drums), Dave Mustaine (lead guitar), and Ron McGovney (bass), who was soon replaced by Cliff Burton. Hetfield referred to their early sound as power metal. The term &quot;thrash metal&quot; was first used when &quot;Kerrang&quot; journalist Malcolm Dome described the Anthrax song &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot; in an issue of &quot;Kerrang&quot; in February 1984.

From 1982 to 1983, Mustaine&#x27;s overly aggressive behavior and drinking problems led to mounting tensions between himself and Hetfield. Mustaine once poured beer onto McGovney&#x27;s bass. On April 1, 1983, the band recruited lead guitarist Kirk Hammett from the band Exodus, and 10 days later, Hetfield and Ulrich officially fired Mustaine from the band due to his erratic indifference. Mustaine was sent home on a four-day bus journey from New York to Los Angeles, and went on to form the heavy metal band Megadeth.

Since the recording of &quot;Load&quot;, Hammett has been recording rhythm guitars as well. Hetfield occasionally plays guitar solos on songs such as &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, &quot;My Friend of Misery&quot;, &quot;Just a Bullet Away&quot;, the outro solo on &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;, the second solo on &quot;To Live Is to Die&quot;, the first solo on &quot;Suicide and Redemption&quot;, the first solo on &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, and the harmonized solo on &quot;Orion&quot;. He also writes the majority of the guitar harmonies, as well as writing the lyrics, vocal melodies, and co-arranging the songs with Ulrich.

Hetfield was involved in an on-stage accident at Olympic Stadium in Montreal during the Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour on August 8, 1992. During the song &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, a pyrotechnic charge reacted. Hetfield&#x27;s guitar protected him from the full force of the blast, but it struck his left side, burning his hand, arm, eyebrows, face and hair. He suffered second and third-degree burns, but was back on stage 17 days later, although his guitar duties were delegated to former guitar tech and Metal Church guitarist John Marshall for four weeks while he made a full recovery.

Hetfield also suffered a broken arm a number of times while skateboarding, which prevented him from playing guitar on stage, and subsequently caused Hetfield&#x27;s management company, &quot;Q Prime&quot;, to put a clause in Hetfield&#x27;s contract forbidding him to ride a skateboard while Metallica was touring. During a live performance on tour for &quot;Metallica&quot;, Hetfield experienced complications with his vocals after performing a cover of the Anti-Nowhere League song &quot;So What?&quot;, forcing him to take vocal lessons for the first time. He did basic warm-up exercises to piano keys with his vocal coach, who also gave him a cassette tape of the piano warm-up for future use. Hetfield still uses the same cassette he was given in the early 1990s to this day before any live performance or any recording Metallica does. Hetfield talks about his vocal training endeavors in the Metallica documentary film, &quot;&quot;, produced and directed by Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky.

During the recording of the band&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;St. Anger&quot; in 2001, Hetfield went into rehab to address his alcohol usage. He rejoined the band after seven months in rehab and four months recovering with his family. His health problems are featured in &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot;. &quot;Some Kind of Monster&quot; also shows the making of the &quot;St. Anger&quot; album, and documents the various conflicts and issues the band were facing at the time including the departure of Jason Newsted, alcoholism, family commitments, and the future of the band.

Hetfield and Metallica recruited Ozzy Osbourne bassist Robert Trujillo. Osbourne replaced him with Jason Newsted shortly after Trujillo&#x27;s transfer. The new line-up has continued to make music and tour worldwide. Metallica&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Death Magnetic&quot;, was released on September 12, 2008. Like &quot;St. Anger&quot; and every album of original material released by Metallica since 1991&#x27;s &quot;Metallica&quot;, &quot;Death Magnetic&quot; went to #1 on the Billboard charts in over 30 countries during its first week of release.

On April 4, 2009, Hetfield, along with remaining Metallica members Ulrich, Hammett, Trujillo, as well as former bassist Newsted, and the deceased Cliff Burton (who was represented by his father), were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In an interview after their nomination, Hetfield commented that everyone who had appeared on an album with the band would be inducted. This excluded original guitarist Dave Mustaine and original bassist Ron McGovney, as both had appeared only on the band&#x27;s early demo tapes. Hetfield and the rest of Metallica, including Newsted, performed &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; to end the ceremony.

==Playing style==
Hetfield has been called &quot;The King of Downpicking&quot; for his right-hand picking speed by Annihilator guitarist Jeff Waters. He has explained he holds the pick with his thumb, index and middle fingers, rather than just the thumb and index, citing additional stability he gains by it.

==Personal life==

Hetfield married Francesca Tomasi on August 17, 1997, and together they have three children. He currently resides in Vail, Colorado, citing a &quot;multitude of reasons&quot; for moving there, including it being his wife&#x27;s childhood hometown, the natural beauty, and the quiet environment. During an interview on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, Hetfield stated that his wife had helped him to mature and learn to deal with his anger issues more constructively, explaining that after they met, his destructive tendencies embarrassed both of them. Hetfield filed for divorce in 2022 citing irreconcilable differences.

Hetfield&#x27;s son Castor is also a musician, playing for the Savannah, Georgia-based band Bastardane as their drummer.

Hetfield has long struggled with addiction problems. In 2001, he entered a rehab program (documented in the film &quot;&quot;), and by early 2002, he began maintaining total abstinence from alcohol. In a 2010 interview with &quot;So What!&quot;, the official magazine of Metallica&#x27;s fan club, Hetfield stated that he is a &quot;reborn straight edge&quot;. However, in 2019, Hetfield once again entered rehab, forcing Metallica to cancel their Australia/New Zealand leg of the WorldWired Tour. Hetfield made his first public appearance since leaving rehab at the Petersen Automotive Museum reception on January 30, 2020.

Hetfield enjoys a variety of activities, most notably hunting; farming and beekeeping; customizing cars and motorcycles in his garage; watching the Las Vegas Raiders, the San Francisco Giants, and the San Jose Sharks; and going to hot rod shows. He put his 1968 Chevrolet Camaro up for sale on eBay, with the proceeds going to a Music for Schools program. The car was used in the video for &quot;I Disappear&quot; and was given to him as a gift upon the video&#x27;s completion. &quot;Slowburn&quot;, his 1936 Auburn boat tail speedster, won the 2010 Goodguys West Coast Custom of the Year.

Hetfield has a number of tattoos, including one which shows flames encasing four playing cards ace (1), 9, 6, and 3 representing the year of his birth, and the words &quot;Carpe Diem&quot; (&quot;seize the day&quot;). The flames on the tattoo are in reference to the pyrotechnic accident which he suffered in 1992 during a concert in Montreal. He has tattooed an &quot;M&quot; and &quot;81&quot; on his right hand for &quot;Metallica&quot; and the year Metallica was founded, 1981, and an &quot;F&quot; on his left hand for &quot;Francesca&quot;. He also has some Christian tattoos, including crosses and one of Jesus on his right arm. He has a tattoo of two razors forming the straight edge X symbol on his left wrist.

The first single Hetfield ever bought was &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd. He was featured in a documentary called &quot;Absent&quot;, directed by Justin Hunt, which takes a look at the effects of absent fathers on their children and the &quot;father wound&quot; that they leave behind.

Hetfield has expressed his disdain for politics and celebrities who &quot;soapbox their opinions&quot;, stating that &quot;for us, people are people you should all have your own opinion&quot;. In 2007, Metallica performed at London&#x27;s Live Earth concert. When Hetfield was asked for his thoughts on climate change, he responded by saying:

In 2008, responding to the use of Metallica&#x27;s music to torture Iraqi prisoners, Hetfield was unoffended and replied, &quot;If the Iraqis aren&#x27;t used to freedom, then I&#x27;m glad to be part of their exposure.&quot; British band Chumbawamba subsequently released a song called &quot;Torturing James Hetfield&quot; as a direct response. In a 2017 interview, Hetfield reaffirmed his previous stance, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m honored my country is using something to help us stay safe, if they are. But then again, once the music is out, I don&#x27;t have control over that. Just like how someone&#x27;s giving it away online. They&#x27;re using it to do what they do.&quot;

==Equipment==
===Guitars===
Hetfield has been a major endorser of ESP Guitars since the 1980s, and is best known for playing custom-made Explorer-style guitars with an EMG 81/EMG 60 set for pickups and since then he has his own signature EMG JH pickups. Hetfield&#x27;s main guitar from the early days was a Flying V copy made in Japan by Electra, which was modified with a Seymour Duncan Invader (SH-8) pickup and used almost exclusively until 1984 when he switched to the Gibson Explorer model.

During the mid-1990s, ESP produced the first of his signature model guitars. To date, Hetfield has had six signature guitars with the company. However, Hetfield often uses guitars from Gibson and other companies instead of ESP despite his endorsement.

Some of Hetfield&#x27;s guitars over the years have included:

===Amplifiers and cabinets===
Throughout Metallica&#x27;s career, Hetfield has used a wide range of different amplifiers. For the first two albums, he used Marshall heads and cabinets, with occasional effects. The specific Marshall that he used for &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; was stolen after a concert prior to the recording of &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;; Hetfield was upset by the theft, as his mother had helped him purchase the amplifier before her death. In 1985, for the recording of &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, he and Kirk Hammett each bought a Mesa/Boogie Mark IIC+ amplifier (the preamp sections of which were connected to Marshall power amplifiers), and since then he has mostly used Mesa/Boogies, including the Triaxis and Rectifier models. Around the time of &quot;St. Anger&quot;, Hetfield began using the Diezel VH4 head. The majority of his clean tones come from a Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier, although many different amplifiers have been used over the years.

In December 2011, it was announced by Fortin Amps that they would team up with Randall Amplifiers to start a new line of tube amplifiers based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. Kirk Hammett currently has two prototypes, and Hetfield will eventually be receiving one.

The amplifiers currently used on tour by Hetfield are:
* Mesa/Boogie TriAxis preamp (x4)
* Mesa/Boogie Simul-Class 2:90 power amp (x2)
* Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier heads
* Diezel VH4 heads
* Mesa/Boogie 4x12 cabinets with Celestion V30 speakers in isolation cabinets
* Roland JC-120 combo amplifiers

===Effects===
To avoid problems with pedals being damaged during live performances, Hetfield keeps his effect pedals in a rack along with his amplifiers and his guitar technician controls them through a pedalboard sidestage. The pedal controller allows him to change between different effect pedals and amplifiers.

Hetfield&#x27;s live rig in 2008 included:

* TC Electronic G-Major
* Line 6 DM4
* Mesa/Boogie Custom Graphic EQ
* MXR Phase 100
* ATI NanoAmp SUM 100
* Klon Centaur
* Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor

* Voodoo Lab Ground Control Pro
* Voodoo Lab GCX Audio Switcher (x2)
* Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus
* DBX 1074 Quad Gate
* Behringer Multigate Pro
In 2010, a Line 6 effects unit was added to the list, along with the TC Electronic unit, perhaps indicating that this had replaced his stompboxes.

===Accessories===
* Ernie Ball Power Slinky strings (.11–.48)
* Dunlop James Hetfield Black Fang 1.14 mm picks
* 3&quot; Levy&#x27;s Straps
* Peterson Strobe 420 Tuner
* EMG JH Het Set
* Shure UR-4D Wireless Equipment
* Furman AR Pro Power Conditioner

In addition, Hetfield uses Shure Super 55 microphones for vocals.

<text>Priory School is a secondary school in Southsea, Hampshire, England. It is situated in the northern area of Southsea bordering Fratton, and lies close to Fratton railway station on the A2047. Stewart Vaughan is the Headteacher at the school. Priory school is an academy and part of the Bohunt Education Trust.

==History==
The current site was originally purchased by the Portsmouth School Board in May 1890 for £3000, at the time the area was known as &quot;The Wilderness&quot; due to the lack of development activity. On the site were several buildings in a heavy state of disrepair, among the buildings were &quot;Howard&#x27;s Cottage&quot; reputedly the oldest building in Portsmouth and home to the ghost of Lady Temple.

The construction of the school cost £9,704 and took two years, the buildings were completed in May 1892. Later extensions of the school site led it to cover the site of an old priory and a farm called &quot;Priory Farm&quot;.

In 1905 it was decided that the Francis Avenue School for girls should move to a building next to the boys school. This school, which cost £25,000 to build, was opened on 4 November 1907.

During the First World War, the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 5th Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties.

During the 1920s the school became heavily over-crowded and an extension to the girls school was completed in 1934. Portsmouth was considered a high-risk target during the Second World War and the girls school moved to Salisbury. On 10 January 1941, German bombing led to the destruction of the boys school and the extension at the girls school. The boys moved to the St Ronan&#x27;s Road School, with the old boys school being left as a bombed out wreck for the next twenty years.

In 1946 the girls school became the Portsmouth Southern Grammar School for Girls. The Southern Grammar School for Boys was on Eastern Road and went on to be part of Portsmouth College.

In the late 1950s the boys school was demolished and replaced with a gymnasium for the girls school. A lecture theatre was completed in the 1960s.

In 1974 the boys school returned to the site, this time merging with the girls school to form Priory comprehensive school. The school became a specialist sports college with the opening of the Priory Tennis Centre in 2006 and it became an academy, sponsored by the Bohunt Education Trust, in September 2014.

<doc id="269828" wikidata="Q785207" url="?curid=269828" title="Frank J. Selke Trophy">
<text>The Frank J. Selke Trophy, or simply the Selke Trophy, is awarded annually to the National Hockey League forward who demonstrates the most skill in the defensive component of the game. The winner is selected by a poll of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association following the regular season. Named after Frank J. Selke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens, the trophy has been awarded 45 times to 27 different players since the 1977–78 NHL season. It is currently held by Florida Panthers center Aleksander Barkov.

==History==
The trophy was first awarded at the end of the 1977–78 NHL season. It was named after Frank J. Selke, former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens. The Selke Trophy was the fifth and last of the major NHL awards to be introduced that have been named after General Managers and owners of the Original Six teams, the other awards being the Art Ross Trophy, James Norris Memorial Trophy, Conn Smythe Trophy, and Jack Adams Award.

The first recipient was Bob Gainey of the Canadiens, who won the trophy the first four years it was given. Patrice Bergeron of the Boston Bruins has won it more times than any other player, with six wins. Guy Carbonneau, Jere Lehtinen and Pavel Datsyuk are tied for the third-most wins, with three apiece.

The Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, and Boston Bruins have won the trophy the most times, with 7 awards apiece. The team with the greatest number of unique winners are the Red Wings with 4—Sergei Fedorov (twice), Steve Yzerman, Kris Draper, and Datsyuk (three times)—all coming since 1994.

There has been only one instance in which a Selke Trophy winner was also awarded the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player when Sergei Fedorov captured both trophies during the 1993–94 NHL season. There has not been an instance in which the Art Ross Trophy winner has been awarded the Selke Trophy, though Fedorov finished second in regular season scoring in 1994, while Hart Trophy winner and Art Ross Trophy runner-up Joe Sakic finished second in Selke voting in 2001. The most points scored in a Selke-winning season is 127 by Doug Gilmour in the 1992–93 NHL season.

==History==

However, were originally a kind of leather shoe made from a single animal hide, as evidenced by historical usage and the earlier form of the word, , written , with the kanji literally signifying &quot;single hide&quot;. As Japanese footwear evolved, also changed, with the split-toe design emerging towards the late Heian period (794–1185 CE) to allow the wearer to accommodate the thong of sandals. Outdoor versions of involved some kind of reinforcement, with soles traditionally made of cloth, leather, or straw.

Contemporary socks—socks with a separation between the big toe and the rest of the toes—are also available. This reflects the number of people who still prefer to wear zori and geta, especially during Japan&#x27;s hot, humid summers.

Modern occasionally have elastic openings instead of fasteners.

Belgian fashion house Maison Margiela has released modern boots with a separated big toe since the late 1980s-early 1990s. They can cost more than $1000 per pair. In 2023, the story of a man stealing a pair of tabi shoes from his Tinder date was amplified by TikTok and other social media sites.

A related item are toe socks, which have five separate compartments; these are known as in Japanese.

<text>The Jack Adams Award is awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) coach &quot;adjudged to have contributed the most to his team&#x27;s success.&quot; The league&#x27;s Coach of the Year award has been presented 48 times to 40 coaches. The winner is selected by a poll of the National Hockey League Broadcasters Association at the end of the regular season. Five coaches have won the award twice, while Pat Burns has won three times, the most of any coach. The award is named in honor of Jack Adams, Hall of Fame player for the Toronto Arenas/St. Patricks, Vancouver Millionaires and original Ottawa Senators, and long-time Coach and General Manager of the Detroit Red Wings. It was first awarded at the conclusion of the regular season.

Jacques Demers is the only coach to win the award in consecutive seasons. Five coaches have won the award with two teams: Jacques Lemaire, Pat Quinn, Scotty Bowman, Barry Trotz, and John Tortorella have won the award twice, while Pat Burns is the only coach to win three times. The franchises with the most Jack Adams Award winners are the Philadelphia Flyers, Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins and Phoenix Coyotes with four winners each, although the Coyotes had two winners in Winnipeg before they moved to Arizona. Bill Barber, Bruce Boudreau and Ken Hitchcock are the only coaches to win the award after replacing the head coach who started the season. Barber took over for Craig Ramsay during the Flyers&#x27; 2000–01 season, Boudreau replaced Glen Hanlon a month into the Capitals&#x27; 2007–08 season while Hitchcock replaced Davis Payne a month into the Blues&#x27; 2011–12 season. The closest vote occurred in , when the winner Lindy Ruff edged out Peter Laviolette by a single point.

<doc id="269839" wikidata="Q550701" url="?curid=269839" title="Louis Moreau Gottschalk">
<text>Louis Moreau Gottschalk (May 8, 1829 – December 18, 1869) was an American composer, pianist, and virtuoso performer of his own romantic piano works. He spent most of his working career outside the United States.

== Life and career ==
Gottschalk was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Edward Gottschalk and Aimée Marie Bruslé. He had six brothers and sisters, five of whom were half-siblings by his father&#x27;s biracial mistress. His family lived for a time in a tiny cottage at Royal and Esplanade in the Vieux Carré. Louis later moved in with relatives at 518 Conti Street; his maternal grandmother Bruslé and his nurse Sally were both Saint Dominican Creoles. He was therefore exposed to a variety of musical traditions, and played the piano from an early age. He was soon recognized as a prodigy by the New Orleans bourgeois establishment, making his informal public debut in 1840 at the new St. Charles Hotel.

Only two years later, at the age of 13, Gottschalk left the United States and sailed to Europe, as he and his father realized a classical training was required to fulfill his musical ambitions. The Paris Conservatoire, however, rejected his application without hearing him, on the grounds of his nationality; Pierre Zimmerman, head of the piano faculty, commented that &quot;America is a country of steam engines&quot;. Gottschalk eventually gained access to the musical establishment through family friends, but important early compositions like &quot;Bamboula (Danse Des Nègres)&quot; and &quot;La Savane&quot; establish him as a genuinely American composer, and not a mere imitator of the European written tradition; they were a major artistic statement as they carried a legacy of slave music in a romantic music context, and as such they were also precursors of jazz. They still stand as the first examples of Louisiana Creole music in classical music culture.
After a concert at the Salle Pleyel, Frédéric Chopin remarked: &quot;Give me your hand, my child; I predict that you will become the king of pianists.&quot; Franz Liszt and Charles-Valentin Alkan, too, recognised Gottschalk&#x27;s extreme talent.

After Gottschalk returned to the United States in 1853, he traveled extensively; a sojourn in Cuba during 1854 was the beginning of a series of trips to Central and South America. Gottschalk also traveled to Puerto Rico after his Havana debut and at the start of his West Indian period. He was quite taken with the music he heard on the island, so much so that he composed a work, probably in 1857, entitled &quot;Souvenir de Porto Rico; Marche des gibaros, Op. 31 (RO250)&quot;. &quot;Gibaros&quot; refers to the jíbaros, or Puerto Rican peasantry, and is an antiquated way of writing this name. The theme of the composition is a march tune which may be based on a Puerto Rican folk song form.

At the conclusion of that tour, he rested in New Jersey then returned to New York City. There he continued to rest and took on a very young Venezuelan student, Teresa Carreño. Gottschalk rarely took on students and was skeptical of prodigies, but Carreño was an exception and he was determined that she would succeed. With his busy schedule, Gottschalk was only able to give her a handful of lessons, yet she would remember him fondly and performed his music for the rest of her days. A year after meeting Gottschalk, she performed for Abraham Lincoln and would go on to become a renowned concert pianist earning the nickname &quot;Valkyrie of the Piano&quot;.

In late 1855 and early 1856 Gottschalk made connections with several notable figures of the New York art world, including the sculptor Erastus Dow Palmer, composer and musician George William Warren and Hudson River School landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church. Like Gottschalk, Church had traveled extensively in Latin America (primarily Ecuador and Colombia) and produced a series of large-scale canvases of South American subject. Gottschalk dedicated a &quot;Mazurka poétique&quot; to Church, who gave Gottschalk a small (now unidentified) landscape painting. Gottschalk also possibly collaborated with Warren on his 1863 &quot;The Andes, Marche di Bravoura&quot;, a solo piano piece inspired by Church&#x27;s large-scale South American painting of 1859, &quot;The Heart of the Andes&quot;.

By the 1860s, Gottschalk had established himself as the best known pianist in the New World. Although born and reared in New Orleans, he was a supporter of the Union cause during the American Civil War. He returned to his native city only occasionally for concerts, but he always introduced himself as a New Orleans native. He composed the tarantella, &quot;Grande Tarantelle&quot;, Op. 67, subtitled &quot;Célèbre Tarentelle,&quot; during 1858–64.
In May 1865, he was mentioned in a San Francisco newspaper as having &quot;travelled 95,000 miles by rail and given 1,000 concerts&quot;. However, he was forced to leave the United States later that year because of an alleged affair with a student at the Oakland Female Seminary in Oakland, California. It is likely that the subsequent publication of this incident was an attempt to undermine Gottschalk’s reputation by a rival of the piano manufacturer Chickering &amp; Sons, the same brand of piano that Gottschalk used on his tours. Gottschalk denied any wrongdoing, but never returned to the United States.

Gottschalk chose to travel to South America, where he continued to give frequent concerts. During one of these concerts, at the Teatro Lyrico Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on November 24, 1869, he collapsed from yellow fever. Just before his collapse, he had finished playing his romantic piece &quot;Morte!&quot; (translated from Portuguese as &quot;Death&quot;), although the actual collapse occurred just as he started to play his celebrated piece &quot;Tremolo&quot;. Gottschalk never recovered from the collapse.

Three weeks later, on December 18, 1869, at the age of 40, he died at his hotel in Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, probably from an overdose of quinine. (According to an essay by Jeremy Nicholas for the booklet accompanying the recording &quot;Gottschalk Piano Music&quot; performed by Philip Martin on the Hyperion label, &quot;He died ... of empyema, the result of a ruptured abscess in the abdomen.&quot;)

In 1870, his remains were returned to the United States and were interred at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York City. His burial spot was originally marked by a magnificent marble monument, topped by an &quot;Angel of Music&quot; statue, which was irreparably damaged by vandals in 1959. In October 2012, after nearly fifteen years of fundraising by the Green-Wood Cemetery, a new &quot;Angel of Music&quot; statue, created by sculptors Giancarlo Biagi and Jill Burkee to replace the damaged one, was unveiled.

== Works ==

Gottschalk&#x27;s music was very popular during his lifetime and his earliest compositions created a sensation in Europe. Early pieces like &quot;Bamboula,&quot; &quot;La Savane,&quot; &quot;Le Bananier&quot; and &quot;Le Mancenillier&quot; were based on Gottschalk&#x27;s memories of the music he heard during his youth in Louisiana and are widely regarded as the earliest existing pieces of creole music in classical culture. In this context, some of Gottschalk&#x27;s work, such as the 13-minute opera &quot;Escenas campestres&quot;, retains value. Gottschalk also utilized the &quot;Bamboula&quot; theme as a melody in his Symphony No. 1: &quot;A Night in the Tropics&quot;. A melody from Gottschalk&#x27;s &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;Andalousie&quot; (&quot;Memories of Andalusia&quot;) forms the basis of a highly popular 20th century piece &quot;Malagueña&quot; by Ernesto Lecuona. 

Many of his compositions were destroyed after his death, or are lost. Musicologist Richard Jackson served as the editor of a 1973 published collection of Gottschalk’s piano music, and concurrently organized an exhibition of Gottschalk and his music at the New York Public Library.

==Recordings==
Various pianists later recorded his piano music. The first important recordings of his orchestral music, including the symphony &quot;A Night in the Tropics&quot;, were made for Vanguard Records by Maurice Abravanel and the Utah Symphony Orchestra. Vox Records issued a multi-disc collection of his music, which was later reissued on CD. This included world premiere recordings of the original orchestrations of both symphonies and other works, which were conducted by Igor Buketoff and Samuel Adler. 

In 1984, Nimbus Records issued &quot;The Lady Fainted&quot;, a selection of piano fantasies, caprices, meditations and paraphrases played by Alan Marks. Lambert Orkis recorded a selection of Gottschalk&#x27;s music on an 1865 Chickering concert grand in 1988 as part of The Smithsonian Collection of Recordings. The music of Gottschalk was used in the soundtrack for the Michel Deville film , which was played by Noël Lee on a Steinway piano and released by Erato Records in 1994. Beginning in the 1990s, Philip Martin recorded most of Gottschalk&#x27;s extant piano music for Hyperion Records.

==In popular culture==
Author Howard Breslin wrote a historical novel about Gottschalk titled &quot;Concert Grand&quot; in 1963.
A version of Gottschalk&#x27;s &quot;Bamboula&quot;, with added lyrics, was recorded in April 1934 by trumpet player Abel Beauregard&#x27;s dance band, the Orchestre Créole Matou from the French Caribbean Guadeloupe island. This is the first recording of this composition, as the first &#x27;classical piano&#x27; recordings of Gottschalk&#x27;s works were not recorded until 1956, by American pianist Eugene List. Other recordings related to the specific bamboula rhythm heard by Gottschalk in New Orleans&#x27; Congo Square and used on his famous 1845 composition &quot;Bamboula&quot; can be found on a 1950 Haitian voodoo recording &quot;Baboule Dance (three drums)&quot;; And on the 1962 Cuban folk tune &quot;Rezos Congos (Bamboula, Conga Music)&quot;. Comments by musicologist Bruno Blum are included in each of the above releases. New Orleans singer and pianist Dr. John&#x27;s recording of &quot;Litanie des Saints&quot; from &quot;Goin&#x27; Back to New Orleans&quot; was inspired by Gottschalk&#x27;s &quot;Souvenir de Porto Rico&quot;.

<doc id="269845" wikidata="Q250753" url="?curid=269845" title="King Clancy Memorial Trophy">
<text>The King Clancy Memorial Trophy is a sports award given annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and who has made a significant humanitarian contribution to his community. The winner is chosen by &quot;a special panel of representatives&quot; from the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association and the NHL Broadcasters&#x27; Association.

The trophy is named in honour of Francis M. &quot;King&quot; Clancy, a former player for the original Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Maple Leafs who later went on to become a coach, referee, and team executive. The trophy was first awarded in 1988 and was presented to the NHL by Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard, who called Clancy &quot;one of the greatest humanitarians that ever lived&quot;. It honours similar community service as the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award, which was retired in 1984.

Five teams have had more than one player win the award. Three members of the Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, New York Islanders, and Boston Bruins have won the award, while two members of the Minnesota Wild, and Detroit Red Wings have also won the award. Ray Bourque and Dave Poulin won it in consecutive years for the Boston Bruins, and Jason Zucker and Matt Dumba won it in consecutive years for the Minnesota Wild. Players from the seven different Canadian teams have won the trophy on 10 of the 28 occasions that it has been awarded. Three members each from the Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and Vancouver Canucks, as well as one each from the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and the original Winnipeg Jets have won the award. Henrik Sedin is the only player who has won it more than once. Henrik and his brother Daniel are the only recipients to have won the trophy jointly.

The similar NHL Foundation Player Award was discontinued for the 2017–18 NHL season, with its associated charitable donation being redirected towards the King Clancy Memorial Trophy instead.

<doc id="269846" wikidata="Q207384" url="?curid=269846" title="Alexander I of Yugoslavia">
<text>Alexander I Karađorđević (, ; – 9 October 1934), also known as Alexander the Unifier ( / ), was King of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes from 16 August 1921 to 3 October 1929 and King of Yugoslavia from 3 October 1929 until his assassination in 1934. His reign of 13 years is the longest of the three monarchs of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Born in Cetinje, Montenegro, Alexander was the second son of Peter and Zorka Karađorđević. The House of Karađorđević had been removed from power in Serbia 30 years prior, and Alexander spent his early life in exile with his father in Montenegro and then Switzerland. Afterwards he moved to Russia and enrolled in the imperial Page Corps. Following a coup d&#x27;état and the murder of King Alexander I Obrenović in 1903, his father became King of Serbia. In 1909, Alexander&#x27;s elder brother, George, renounced his claim to the throne, making Alexander heir apparent. Alexander distinguished himself as a commander during the Balkan Wars, leading the Serbian army to victory over the Ottoman Turks and the Bulgarians. In 1914, he became prince regent of Serbia. During the First World War, he held nominal command of the Royal Serbian Army.

In 1918, Alexander oversaw the unification of Serbia and the former Austrian provinces of Croatia-Slavonia, Slovenia, Vojvodina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Dalmatia into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on the basis of the Corfu Declaration. He ascended to the throne upon his father&#x27;s death in 1921. An extended period of political crisis followed, culminating in the assassination of Croat leader Stjepan Radić. In response, Alexander abrogated the Vidovdan Constitution in 1929, prorogued the parliament, changed the name of the country to Kingdom of Yugoslavia and established a royal dictatorship. The 1931 Constitution formalised Alexander&#x27;s personal rule and confirmed Yugoslavia&#x27;s status as a unitary state, further aggravating the non-Serb population. Political and economic tensions escalated on the outbreak of the Great Depression, which devastated the predominantly rural country. In foreign affairs, Alexander supported the Balkan Pact with Greece, Romania, and Turkey, and sought to improve relations with Bulgaria.

In 1934, Alexander embarked on a state visit to France in order to secure support for the Little Entente against Hungarian revanchism and Fascist Italy&#x27;s imperialist designs. During a stop in Marseille, he was assassinated by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the pro-Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization, which received assistance from the Croat Ustaše led by Ante Pavelić. French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou also died in the attack. Alexander was succeeded by his eleven-year-old son, Peter II, under the regency of his first cousin Prince Paul.

==Early life==
Alexander Karađorđević was born on in the Principality of Montenegro as the fourth child and second son of Peter Karađorđević and his wife, Princess Zorka of Montenegro. His paternal grandfather, also named Alexander, had been forced to abdicate as prince of Serbia and surrender power to the rival House of Obrenović. Alexander&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Nicholas I, Prince of Montenegro. Despite enjoying support from the Russian Empire, at the time of Alexander&#x27;s birth and early childhood, the House of Karađorđević was in political exile, with family members scattered all over Europe, unable to return to Serbia.

Serbia had recently been transformed from a principality into a kingdom under the Obrenovićs, who ruled with strong support from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The antagonism between the two rival royal houses was such, that, after the assassination of Prince Mihailo Obrenović in 1868 (an event Karađorđevićs were suspected of taking part in), the Obrenovićs resorted to making constitutional changes, specifically proclaiming the Karađorđevićs banned from entering Serbia and stripping them of their civic rights.

Alexander was two when his mother, Princess Zorka, died in 1890 from complications while giving birth to his younger brother, Andrej, who died 23 days later. Alexander spent his childhood in Montenegro. In 1894, his widower father took the four children, including Alexander, to Geneva, Switzerland where the young man completed his elementary education. Alongside his older brother George, he continued his schooling at the imperial Page Corps in Petrograd, Russian Empire. The British historian Robert Seton-Watson described Alexander as becoming a Russophile during his time in Petrograd, feeling much gratitude for the willingness of the Russian Emperor Nicholas II to give him a refuge, where he was treated with much honor and respect.

As a page, Alexander was described as hard-working and determined while also being a &quot;loner&quot; who kept to himself and rarely showed his feelings. Being a Karađorđević led to Alexander being invited by the Russian Emperor Nicholas II to dinner at the Winter Palace, where he was the guest of honor at meals hosted by the Russian imperial family, which was a great honor for a prince from Serbia&#x27;s deposed princely family. During his time in Petrograd, Alexander visited the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, where the abbot gave Alexander an icon of Prince Alexander Nevsky and guided him to the grave of Marshal Alexander Suvorov. After his visit to the monastery, Alexander expressed the wish to be a great general like Marshal Suvorov or Prince Alexander Nevsky, saying he wanted to be commanding either a great army or a great armada when he was a man.

In 1903, while young George and Alexander were in school, a slew of conspirators pulled off a bloody coup d&#x27;état in the Kingdom of Serbia, known as the May Overthrow, in which King Alexander and Queen Draga were murdered and dismembered. The House of Karađorđević thus retook the Serbian throne after forty-five years and Alexander&#x27;s 58-year-old father became King of Serbia, prompting George&#x27;s and Alexander&#x27;s return to Serbia to continue their studies. After Alexander&#x27;s 15th birthday, King Peter had Alexander enlisted into the Royal Serbian Army as a private with instructions to his officers to only promote his son if he proved worthy. On 25 March 1909, Alexander was suddenly recalled to Belgrade by his father with no explanation offered other than that he had an important announcement for his son.

===Becoming crown prince===

In 1909, a scandal broke when Crown Prince George, Alexander&#x27;s older brother, killed a servant by kicking him in the stomach. Following pressure from powerful figures such as Prime Minister Nikola Pašić and high-ranking officers Dragutin &quot;Apis&quot; Dimitrijević and Petar Živković, George publicly renounced his claim to the throne in March of that year in favour of Alexander.

In 1910, Alexander nearly died from stomach typhus and was left with stomach problems for the rest of his life. In the run-up to the First Balkan War, Alexander played the role of a diplomat, visiting Sofia to meet Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria for secret talks for a Balkan League to drive the Ottoman Turks out of the Balkans. Both Bulgaria and Serbia had rival claims to the Ottoman region of Macedonia, so Alexander, along with Ferdinand&#x27;s son Crown Prince Boris, traveled to Petrograd to see the Russian Emperor Nicholas II to ask for Russian mediation. In March 1912, Serbia and Bulgaria signed a defensive alliance that was later joined by Greece in May 1912.

==Balkan Wars and World War I==

In March 1912, Alexander had a meeting with ten senior military commanders. They all agreed to end all internal conflicts in the Royal Serbian Army and fully commit to realizing national goals, which allowed space for consolidation before the two successive Balkan Wars.

In the First Balkan War in 1912, as commander of the First Army, Crown Prince Alexander fought victorious battles in Kumanovo and Bitola. One of Alexander&#x27;s most cherished moments came when he drove the Ottoman Turks out of Kosovo and on 28 October 1912 led the Royal Serbian Army on a review on the Field of Blackbirds. The Field of Blackbirds was where the Serbs under Prince Lazar had been defeated in a legendary battle by the Ottoman sultan Murad I on 28 June 1389, and is regarded by the Serbs as holy ground. It was a great honor for him to pay his respects to the Serbs who had fallen in that earlier battle. In the aftermath of the First Balkan War, disputes emerged among the victors over control of Macedonia, and Serbia and Greece signed an alliance against the Kingdom of Bulgaria.

After the Ottoman defeat and withdrawal from Skopje (most of whom had left after the Albanian revolt of 1912), Prince Alexander was met with flowers by the local people. He stopped and asked a seven-year-old girl, Vaska Zoicheva, &quot;What are you?&quot; () When she replied &quot;Bulgarian!&quot; (), the prince slapped her. This news of the event spread quickly around Bulgaria. Later in 1913, during the Second Balkan War, Alexander commanded the Serbian Army at the Battle of Bregalnica against the Bulgarians. In 1920 and 1921, Serbian authorities searched for the girl&#x27;s father, Danail Zoichev, and offered him money to renounce the event as fictional, but he refused.

In the aftermath of the Second Balkan War, the region of Vardar Macedonia was attributed to the Kingdom of Serbia by the Treaty of Bucharest (1913). Prince Alexander took sides in the complicated power struggle over how Macedonia should be administered. In this, Alexander bested Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević &quot;Apis&quot; and in the wake of this, Alexander&#x27;s father, King Peter, agreed to hand over royal powers to his son. Though Colonel Dimitrijević was the mastermind of the 1903 coup that had restored the House of Karađorđević to the Serbian throne, Alexander distrusted him, regarding his attempts to set himself up as a &quot;kingmaker&quot; and to have the Serbian Army be a &quot;state within the state&quot; existing outside of civilian control as a major threat.

Additionally, Alexander saw Dimitrijević as an irresponsible intriguer who having betrayed one king might always betray another. In January 1914, the Serbian prime minister Nikola Pašić sent a letter to the Russian Emperor Nicholas II in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the daughters of Nicholas II. Nicholas II in his reply stated that his daughters would not be forced into arranged marriages, but noted Alexander on his most recent trips to Petrograd had during dinners at the Winter Palace kept giving loving looks at the Grand Duchess Tatiana, leading him to guess that it was her whom Alexander wanted to marry. On 24 June 1914, Alexander became regent of Serbia.
On 24 July 1914, Alexander was one of the first Serbian officials to see the Austrian ultimatum containing terms deliberately written to inspire rejection. Turning to Russia for help, Alexander was advised to help the ultimatum as much as he could. Alexander was late to say he &quot;went as far as an independent could&quot; to accept the ultimatum, as Serbia accepted all of the terms except for the one demanding that Austrian police officers investigating the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand could operate on Serbian soil with the powers of arrest, which would have been the effective end of Serbia as an independent state. As expected, the Austrians declared war on Serbia, and Alexander threw himself into preparing his nation&#x27;s defense. In a letter to King Nicholas of Montenegro, Alexander wrote: &quot;God has willed yet again that the Serbian people should give their lives for Serbs everywhere ... I pray for the support of my dear and wise forefathers&quot;.

At the outbreak of World War I he was the nominal supreme commander of the Royal Serbian Army; true command was in the hands of the Chief of Staff of Supreme Headquarters, a position held by Stepa Stepanović (during the mobilisation), Radomir Putnik (1914–1915), Petar Bojović (1916–1917) and Živojin Mišić (1918). The Serbian Army distinguished itself in the battles at Cer and at the Drina (the Battle of Kolubara) in 1914, scoring victories against the invading Austro-Hungarian forces and evicting them from the country.

The British historian Max Hastings described the Royal Serbian Army in 1914 as the toughest army in Europe and also the most egalitarian, with none of the distinctions of rank that characterized the other European armies, exemplified by how the Serbian Army was the only army in Europe where officers would shake hands with the other ranks. However, the Serbian Army suffered major shortages of equipment with a third of the men called up in August 1914 having no rifles or ammunition, and new recruits being advised to bring their own boots and clothing as there were no uniforms for them. Alexander ordered the Serbian police to conduct searches of houses all over Serbia to see if there were any rifles and ammunition to be seized for the army.
In 1915, the Serbian Army was attacked on several fronts by the allied forces of Germany and Austria-Hungary, suffering heavy losses. On 7 October 1915 an Austro-German army group under the command of Field Marshal August von Mackensen invaded Serbia and after encountering fierce resistance took Belgrade on 9 October. On 14 October 1915, Bulgaria invaded Serbia and on 16 October the Bulgarians took Niš, severing the railroad that linked Serbia to Thessalonika in Greece. Being attacked from the north by the Austrians and the Germans and from the south by the Bulgarians, the Serbs by 25 November 1915 had been forced into the Kosovo region.

The massacres committed by the Austrians when they invaded Serbia in 1914 twice caused enormous panic and hundreds of thousands of Serbs fled their homes to escape the Austrians, which greatly delayed the movement of the Serbian Army. Field Marshal Radomir Putnik persuaded Crown Prince Alexander and King Peter that it was better to keep the Serbian Army intact to one day liberate Serbia rather to stand and fight in Kosovo as many Serb officers wanted.

The Serbian Army withdrew through the gorges of Montenegro and northern Albania to the Greek island of Corfu, where it was reorganized. The march across the &quot;Prokletije&quot; (&quot;Accursed&quot;) Mountains was a harrowing one as the Serbian Army together with a mass of refugees had to cross mountains that rose to 3,000 feet high in the middle of winter, with the average daily temperature being −20° while battling the hostile Albanian tribes with the armies of Austria, Germany, and Bulgaria in pursuit. Many Serbs died along the way, as one Serbian soldier wrote in his diary how the refugees rested by the side of the road were: &quot;Immobilized by the snow their heads rest to their breasts. The white snowflakes dance around them while the alpine winds whistle their songs of death. The heads of horses and oxen which have fallen protrude from the snow&quot;.

As the Serbs braved the icy winds and snowdrifts, the only consolation for Alexander was that the winter weather was also delaying the German, Austrian, and Bulgarian armies under the command of von Mackensen that were pursuing his army. Alexander repeatedly exposed himself to danger during the march to the sea while his health declined. Upon reaching the sea, the surviving Serbs who numbered about 140,000 were rescued by British and French ships, which took them to Corfu.

In September 1915, the Royal Serbian Army was estimated to have the strength of about 420,000 men, of whom 94,000 had been killed or wounded while another 174,000 had been captured or were missing during the fall campaign in 1915 and the subsequent retreat to the sea. The losses taken by Serb civilians during the autumn campaign in 1915 together with the retreat to the sea have never been calculated, but are estimated to be massive. The situation was further worsened by the outbreak of a typhus and relapsing fever epidemic which ravaged the country in 1915. Serb losses as a percentage of the population were the greatest of any belligerent in the war.
The surviving Serb soldiers were ultimately taken to Thessalonika to join the &quot;Armées alliées en Orient&quot;. In the fall of 1916, Alexander&#x27;s long-standing dispute with the secret military society of the Black Hand came to ahead, when Colonel Dimitrijević began to openly criticize his leadership. Suspecting a threat to the throne, Alexander promptly had officers who were members of the Black Hand arrested in December 1916 and tried for insubordination; after their convictions, Dimitrijević and several other Black Hand leaders were executed by firing squad on 23 June 1917.
At the same time, the Serbian government-in-exile led by Prime Minister Nikola Pašić was in contact with the Yugoslav Committee, a group of anti-Habsburg Croat, Slovene, and Bosnian Serb politicians and political activists led by Ante Trumbić who aimed to create a new nation to be called &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; which would unite all of the South Slavic peoples into one unitary state. In June 1917, the Corfu Declaration was signed by Pašić and Trumbić promising Yugoslavia after the war. Alexander seems to have been dubious about the plans for Yugoslavia, as throughout the war, he spoke in terms of liberating Serbia. The introduction of the 14 Points by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in January 1918 increased Alexander&#x27;s doubts about Yugoslavia as Point 10 spoke of &quot;substantial autonomy&quot; in the Austrian Empire after the war, not breaking it up. Not willing to antagonise Wilson, Alexander favored a &quot;greater Serbia&quot; that saw the Serbs annex South Slav-inhabited parts of the Habsburg lands. Though the Crown Prince declared in a speech during a visit to Britain that he was &quot;fighting for Yugoslav unity in a Yugoslav state&quot;, when he addressed his own soldiers he stated he was fighting for &quot;the reestablishment of Serbia, our dear homeland&quot;.

In a sign of the trouble to come, Trumbić demanded to have the right to speak for the South Slavs living under Austrian rule, a demand that Alexander rejected under the grounds that the Serbian government represented the South Slavs. After the army was regrouped and reinforced, it achieved a decisive victory on the Macedonian Front, at Kajmakchalan. The Serbian army carried out a major part in the final Allied breakthrough on the Macedonian Front in the autumn of 1918. The debate whatever the Serbian Army was fighting for Yugoslavia or Serbia resolved itself in October–November 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, leaving the Royal Serbian Army to move into the vacuum.

The Kingdom of Italy had ambitions to annex Dalmatia, Istria, and much of Slovenia, leading the Croats and the Slovenes to prefer living with their fellow Slavs. On 1 December 1918, the National Council asked Alexander to declare Serbia united with the former Austrian provinces of Croatia-Slavonia, Slovenia, Vojvodina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Dalmatia on the basis of the Corfu Declaration. Serbia had been devastated by the war, and 1 out of every 5 Serbs who were alive in 1914 were dead by 1918. Much of Alexander&#x27;s time in the immediate post-war years was to be taken up with reconstruction.

==King of Yugoslavia==

On 1 December 1918, in a prearranged set piece, Alexander, as Prince Regent, received a delegation of the People&#x27;s Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, an address was read out by one of the delegation, and Alexander made an address in acceptance. This was considered to be the birth of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. One of Alexander&#x27;s first acts as Prince Regent of the new kingdom was to declare his support for the widespread demand for land reform, stating: &quot;In our free state there can and will be only free landowners&quot;.

On 25 February 1919, Alexander signed a land reform decree breaking up all feudal estates over the size of 100 cadastral &quot;yokes&quot; with compensation to be paid for the former landowners except for those who belonged to the House of Habsburg and the other ruling families of enemy states in the Great War. Under the land reform decree some two million hectares of land was handed over to a half million peasant households, though the implementation was very slow, taking 15 years before land reform was complete.

In both Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the majority of the landlords who lost land were Muslims while the majority of their former tenants who received the land were Christians, and in both places land reform was seen as an attack on the political and economic power of the Muslim gentry. In Croatia, Slovenia, and Vojvodina, the majority of the landlords who lost their land were Austrian or Hungarian nobility who usually did not reside in those places, meaning that however much they might have resented the loss of their land it did not have the sort of political repercussions it did in Macedonia and in Bosnia where the Albanian and Bosnian Muslim landlords lived.
On August 16, 1921, upon the death of his father, Alexander ascended to the throne of the &quot;Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes&quot;, which from its inception was colloquially known both in the Kingdom and the rest of Europe alike as &quot;Yugoslavia&quot;. The historian Brigit Farley described Alexander as something of a cipher to historians as he was a taciturn and reserved man who loathed to express his feelings either in person or in writing. As Alexander kept no diary or wrote no memoirs, Farley wrote that any biography of Alexander could easily be titled &quot;In search of King Alexander&quot; as he remains an elusive and enigmatic figure.

The British historian R. W. Seton-Watson, who knew Alexander well, called him a soldiery man most comfortable in a military milieu who was very quiet and surprisingly modest for a king. Seton-Watson described Alexander as having an &quot;autocratic&quot; personality, a man who was first and foremost a soldier who spent &quot;six of his formative years&quot; in the Serbian Army, which left him with a &quot;military outlook which unfitted him to deal with the delicate problems of constitutional government and which made compromise hard for him&quot;.

Seton-Watson wrote that Alexander &quot;...was very courageous, though not ever a man of strong physique or robust health. He had a strong fixity of purpose, great devotion to duty, powers of sustained work. He had great charm and simplicity of manner. He was accessible and very open to opinions-though he rarely acted on them, and though occasionally he reacted with positive violence, as in the case of the Slovene Zerjav who fainted in his presence.&quot;

One of the things that historians can be certain about Alexander was his belief in keeping Yugoslavia as a unitary state and his consistent opposition to federalism, which he believed would lead to the break-up of Yugoslavia and perhaps his own assassination. In turn, Alexander&#x27;s opposition to federalism related to his belief that in a federalised Yugoslavia, the &quot;prečani&quot; Serbs would be discriminated against by the Croats and Bosnian Muslims, once telling a Serb Orthodox priest that federalism would be &quot;stabbing the Serbs in the back&quot;.
As a Karađorđević, Alexander was very conscious of the long blood-feud between the Houses of Obrenović and Karađorđević that had disfigured Serb politics in the 19th century and that the 1903 coup d&#x27;état that finally brought down the Obrenovićs and led to the Karađorđevićs regaining the throne had happened because the last Obrenović king, Alexander, was widely viewed as too subservient to Austria-Hungary and as having betrayed Serb interests. Because of the frequent changes in loyalty in the Royal Serbian Army in the 19th century between the feuding royal families, Alexander was never entirely convinced that the Serb-dominated officer corps of the Royal Yugoslav Army were completely loyal to him, and always had the fear if he was seen to be betraying Serbdom as the last Obrenović king was, he too might be overthrown and killed.
On 8 June 1922, he married Princess Maria of Romania, who was a daughter of Ferdinand I of Romania and his wife, Princess Marie of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria. They had three sons: Crown Prince Peter, and Princes Tomislav and Andrej. He was said to have wished to marry Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia, a cousin of his wife and the second daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, and was distraught by her untimely death in the Russian Civil War. The Russophile Alexander was horrified by the murders of the House of Romanov-including the Grand Duchess Tatiana-and during his reign was very hostile towards the Soviet Union, welcoming Russian emigres to Belgrade.

The lavish royal wedding to Princess Maria of Romania was intended to cement the alliance with Romania, a fellow &quot;victor nation&quot; in World War I which like Yugoslavia had territorial disputes with the defeated nations like Hungary and Bulgaria. For Alexander, the royal wedding was especially satisfactory as most of the royal families of Europe attended, which showed that the House of Karađorđević, a family of peasant origins who were disliked for slaughtering the rival House of Obrenović in 1903, were finally accepted by the rest of European royalty.
In foreign policy, Alexander favored maintaining the international system created in 1918–19, and in 1921 Yugoslavia joined the Little Entente with Czechoslovakia and Romania to guard against Hungary. Hungary refused to accept the Treaty of Trianon and made territorial claims against all three states of the Little Entente.

In 1921, a war veteran and communist Spasoje Stejić Baćo attempted to assassinate king Alexander by throwing a bomb at his carriage. The bomb was thrown from a balcony and it got stuck in the telephone wires and it ended up wounding several bystanders.

The principal enemy of Yugoslavia in the 1920s was Fascist Italy, which wanted much of what is now modern Slovenia and Croatia. The origins of the Italo-Yugoslav dispute concerned the Italian contention that they had been &quot;cheated&quot; out of what they had been promised in the secret Treaty of London in 1915 at the Paris peace conference in 1919. It was largely out of the fear of Italy that Alexander in 1927 signed a treaty of alliance with France, which therefore became Yugoslavia&#x27;s principal ally. In fact, Alexander I and Benito Mussolini were arch-rivals.

Starting in 1926, an alliance of the Serb Democrats led by Svetozar Pribićević and the Croat Peasant Party led by Stjepan Radić had systematically obstructed the &quot;skupština&quot; to press for federalism for Yugoslavia, filibustering and filing nonsensical motions to prevent the government from passing any bills. In response to obstructionism from the opposition parties, in June 1928, one frustrated deputy from Montenegro took out his handgun and shot Radić on the floor of the &quot;skupština&quot;. The charismatic Radić, the &quot;uncrowned king of Croatia&quot;, had inspired intense devotion in Croatia and his assassination was seen as a sort of Serb declaration of war. The assassination pushed Yugoslavia to the brink of civil war and led Alexander to consider the &quot;amputation&quot; of Croatia as preferable to federalism.

Alexander mused to Pribićević that: &quot;We cannot stay together with the Croats. Since we cannot, it would be better to separate. The best way to be to effect a peaceful separation like Sweden and Norway did&quot;. When Pribićević protested that this would be an act of &quot;treason&quot;, Alexander told him he would think some more about what to do. Alexander appointed the Slovene Catholic priest, Father Anton Korošec prime minister with one mandate, namely to stop the slide towards civil war. On 1 December 1928, the lavish celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the founding of the triune Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes that the government organized led to rioting that left 10 dead in Zagreb.

In response to the political crisis triggered by the assassination of Stjepan Radić, King Alexander abolished the Constitution on 6 January 1929, prorogued the Parliament and introduced a personal dictatorship (the so-called &quot;January 6th Dictatorship&quot;, &quot;Šestojanuarska diktatura&quot;). One of the first acts of the new regime was to carry out a purge of the civil service with one-third of the civil service being fired by May 1929 in an attempt to address popular complaints about rampant corruption in the bureaucracy. He also changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and changed the internal divisions from the 33 oblasts to nine new &quot;banovinas&quot; on 3 October. Of the &quot;banovinas&quot;, only one had a Slovene majority, two had Croat majorities and the rest had Serb majorities, which especially angered the Bosnian Muslims who were in a minority in every &quot;banovina&quot;.

The way in which the &quot;banovinas&quot; were based on new borders that did not correspond to the historical regional borders led to much resentment, especially in Bosnia and Croatia. The &quot;banovinas&quot; were named after the topography of Yugoslavia rather than the historical names in a bid to weaken regional loyalties, being governed by &quot;bans&quot; appointed by the King. In the same month, he tried to banish by decree the use of Serbian Cyrillic to promote the exclusive use of the Latin alphabet in Yugoslavia.

Alexander replaced the three regional flags for the triune Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes with a single flag for the entire country, brought in a single legal code for his realm, imposed a single fiscal code so all of his subjects would pay the same tax rate, and a Yugoslav Agrarian Bank was created by merging all of the regional agrarian banks into one. Alexander tried to promote a sense of Yugoslav identity by always taking his vacations in Slovenia, naming his second son after a Croat king, and being a godfather to a Bosnian Muslim child. Alexander had once fraternised frequently with ordinary people, being known for his habit of making unannounced visits to various villages all over Yugoslavia to chat with ordinary people but after the proclamation of the royal dictatorship, his social circle consisted of a few generals and courtiers, causing the King to lose touch with his subjects.
Within Serbia, the royal dictatorship for the first time made Alexander into an unpopular figure. The British historian Richard Crampton wrote many Serbs &quot;...were alienated by the attempt, albeit unsuccessful, to lessen the Serbian domination on which, to add insult to injury, many of the faults of the previous system were blamed. Alexander had implicitly made the Serbs, the most reliable proponents of centralism, the villains of the Vidovdan piece&quot;. The royal dictatorship was seen in Croatia as merely a form of Serbian domination, and one result was a marked upswing in support for fascistic &quot;Ustashe&quot;, which advocated winning Croat independence via violence.

By 1931, the Ustaše were waging a terrorist campaign of bombings, assassinations, and sabotage, which at least in part explained Alexander&#x27;s reluctance to engage with ordinary people as he done in the past out of the fear of assassination. On 14 February 1931, Alexander visited Zagreb, and the men of the Turnopolje district, who for centuries always provided a mounted honour guard for any royal visitor to Zagreb, failed to show up, a snub that shown how unpopular Alexander had become in Croatia. On 19 February 1931, the Croat historian Milan Šufflay was murdered by police agents, becoming an international &quot;cause célèbre&quot; with Albert Einstein and Heinrich Mann leading a campaign to pressure Alexander to prosecute Šufflay&#x27;s killers.

The Great Depression was especially severe in predominantly rural Yugoslavia as it caused deflation leading to a collapse in price of agricultural products. The Croat politician Ante Trumbić summed up the feelings of many when he gave a speech in early 1931 stating: &quot;We are in a crisis, an economic, financial and moral crisis. There is no material or moral credit in the country. Nobody believes anything anymore!&quot; However, Alexander remain unperturbed, stating in an interview with the press: &quot;Yugoslav politics will never again be driven by narrow religious, regional or national interests&quot;. In response to pressure from Yugoslavia&#x27;s allies, especially France and Czechoslovakia, led Alexander to decide to lessen the royal dictatorship by bringing in a new constitution which allowed the &quot;skupština&quot; to meet again.

In 1931, Alexander decreed a new Constitution which transferred executive power to the King. Elections were to be by universal male suffrage. The provision for a secret ballot was dropped and pressure on public employees to vote for the governing party was to be a feature of all elections held under Alexander&#x27;s constitution. Furthermore, the King would appoint half of the upper house directly, and legislation could become law with the approval of one of the houses alone if it were also approved by the King. The 1931 constitution kept Yugoslavia as a unitary state, which enraged the non-Serbian peoples who demanded a federation and saw Alexander&#x27;s royal dictatorship as thinly disguised Serbian domination. In the elections for the &quot;skupština&quot; in December 1931 – January 1932, the call of the opposition parties to boycott the vote were widely heeded, a sign of popular dissatisfaction with the new constitution.

In response to the impoverishment of the countryside caused by the Great Depression, Alexander reaffirmed in a speech the right of every peasant family to a minimum amount of land that could not be seized by a bank in the event of a debt default. In 1932 he issued a decree suspending all debt payments by farmers to the banks for six months and forbade any more foreclosures by the banks against farmers. Alexander&#x27;s measures preventing the banks to foreclose on farmers who were unable to pay their loans saved many peasants from being ruined and prevented economic distress in the countryside from turning political, but in the long run, his policies did not solve the economic problems of the rural areas.

The losses taken by the banks and their inability to foreclose on farmers who had delinquent loans made the banks unwilling to make new loans to the farmers. As Yugoslav agriculture, especially in the southern parts of the country was backward, the farmers needed loans to modernise their farms, but the unwillingness of the banks to lend to the farmers made modernisation of the farms impossible in the 1930s.

In September 1932, Alexander&#x27;s friend, the Croat politician Ante Trumbić gave an interview with &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper, where he stated that life for ordinary Croats was better when they were part of the Austrian empire and stated that perhaps the Croats would be better off if they broke away from Yugoslavia to form their own state. For Alexander, who always respected and liked Trumbić to see his former friend come very close to embracing Croat separatism was a painful blow. On 7 November 1932, Trumbić and Vladko Maček of the Croat Peasant Party issued the so-called Zagreb Points, which demanded a new constitution which would turn Yugoslavia into a federation, and stated that the Croats would otherwise demand independence.

Alexander had Maček imprisoned without charges, but the issuing of the Zagreb Points inspired the other peoples to issue similar declarations with the Slovenes issuing the Ljubljana Points, the Bosnian Muslims issuing the Sarajevo Points and the Magyars issuing the Novi Sad points. The emergence of a multi-ethnic opposition movement embracing the non-Serb peoples threatened to break the country apart and forced Alexander to ease the level of repression as his ministers warned him that he could not imprison the entire country.

In Macedonia, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation was continuing its long-running guerrilla struggle while in Croatia the security situation had further deteriorated by 1932. By the end of 1932, the &quot;Ustashe&quot; had blown up hundreds of trains and assassinated hundreds of government officials. The often violent response of the mainly-Serb gendarmes to &quot;Ustashe&quot; terrorism fuelled more support for the &quot;Ustashe&quot;. To many, it appeared that Yugoslavia was sliding into the civil war that Alexander&#x27;s &quot;self-coup&quot; of January 1929 was supposed to prevent.
Starting in 1933, Alexander had become worried about Nazi Germany. In March 1933, the French minister in Belgrade, Paul-Émile Naggiar, told Alexander that France was seriously worried about the stability of Yugoslavia and warned that the King could not continue to rule in face of opposition from the majority of his subjects and that Paris viewed that Alexander was starting to become a liability for France. Naggiar predicted the new regime in Germany was going to challenge the international order created by the Treaty of Versailles sooner or later and that France needed Yugoslavia to be stable and strong, which led Naggiar to advise the King to adopt federalism for his realm.

However, one point of agreement of Alexander with Mussolini was his fear of &quot;Anschluss&quot; which would make Germany a direct neighbour of Yugoslavia. Alexander had no desire to have Germany as a neighbour, which led him to support the continuation of Austrian independence. Despite his distaste for communism, the King gave support, albeit in a very cautious and hesitant way, to the plans of French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou to bring the Soviet Union into a front meant to contain Germany. In 1933–34, Alexander become the proponent of a Balkan Pact, which would unite Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania and Turkey.

Although the Balkan Pact was directed primarily against Italy and its allies (Hungary, Albania and Bulgaria), Alexander hoped the pact might provide some protection against Germany. After the coup d&#x27;état in May 1934 in Sofia, King Alexander also hoped that Bulgaria would join the Balkan Entente. The new Bulgarian government had started repression against IMRO. In September 1934, Alexander visited Sofia to improve relations with Bulgaria. A Bulgarian military organisation, Zveno, supported the unification of Bulgaria and Albania into Yugoslavia, which agreed with Alexander&#x27;s policy, &quot;Balkans for the Balkan peoples&quot;.

==Assassination==
After the Ustaše&#x27;s Velebit uprising in November 1932, Alexander said through an intermediary to the Italian government, &quot;If you want to have serious riots in Yugoslavia or cause a regime change, you need to kill me. Shoot at me and be sure you have finished me off, because that&#x27;s the only way to make changes in Yugoslavia.&quot;

The French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou had attempted in 1934 to build an alliance meant to contain Germany, consisting of France&#x27;s allies in Eastern Europe like Yugoslavia, together with Italy and the Soviet Union. The long-standing rivalry between Benito Mussolini and King Alexander had complicated Barthou&#x27;s work as Alexander complained about Italian claims against his country together with Italian support for Hungarian revisionism and the Croat &quot;Ustaše&quot;.

As long as the French ally Yugoslavia continued to have disputes with Italy, Barthou&#x27;s plans for an Italo-French rapprochement would be stillborn. During a visit to Belgrade in June 1934, Barthou promised the king that France would pressure Mussolini into signing a treaty under which he would renounce his claims against Yugoslavia. Alexander was sceptical of Barthou&#x27;s plan, noting that there were hundreds of &quot;Ustaše&quot; being sheltered in Italy and it was rumoured that Mussolini had financed an unsuccessful attempt by the &quot;Ustaše&quot; to assassinate him in December 1933.

Mussolini had come to believe that it was only the personality of Alexander that was holding Yugoslavia together and that if the king were assassinated, Yugoslavia would descend into civil war, which would allow Italy to annex certain regions of Yugoslavia without fear of reprisal from France. However, France was Yugoslavia&#x27;s closest ally, and Barthou invited Alexander for a visit to France to sign a Franco-Yugoslav agreement that would allow Barthou to &quot;go to Rome with the certainty of success&quot;. As a result of the previous deaths of three family members on Tuesdays, Alexander refused to undertake any public functions on that day of the week. On Tuesday, 9 October 1934, however, he had no choice, as he was arriving in Marseille to begin a state visit to France to strengthen both countries&#x27; alliance in the Little Entente.

While Alexander was being slowly driven in a car through the streets along with French Foreign Minister Barthou, a Bulgarian assassin, Vlado Chernozemski, stepped into the street and shot the King twice and the chauffeur with a Mauser C96 semiautomatic pistol. Alexander died in the car and was slumped backwards in the seat with his eyes open. Barthou was also killed by a stray bullet fired by French police during the scuffle following the attack. Lieutenant-Colonel Piollet struck the assailant with his sword. Ten people in the procession were wounded, including General Alphonse Georges who was hit by two bullets as he tried to intervene. Nine people in the crowd that came to see the king were wounded, four of them fatally. Among them was Yolande Farris, barely 20 years old, on Place Castellane, who came to the Palais de la Bourse to see the king. She was hit by a stray bullet and died at the Hôtel-Dieu on October 11, 1934. Mrs. Dumazet and Durbec, who also came to see the king, also died.

It was one of the first assassinations to be captured on film; the shooting occurred in front of the newsreel cameraman, who was only metres away at the time. While the exact moment of shooting was not captured on film, the events leading to the assassination and the immediate aftermath were. The body of the chauffeur Foissac, who had been mortally wounded, slumped and jammed against the brakes of the car, which allowed the cameraman to continue filming from within inches of the King for a number of minutes afterwards. 
The film record of Alexander I&#x27;s assassination remains one of the most notable pieces of newsreel in existence, alongside the film of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia&#x27;s coronation, the state funeral of Queen Victoria and that of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. A 20th Century Fox newsreel presented by Graham McNamee was manipulated to give the audience the impression that the assassination had been captured on film. Three identical gunshot sounds were added to the film afterwards, but in reality, Chernozemski fired his handgun over ten times and killed or wounded a total of 15 people. A straw hat is shown on the ground, as if it had belonged to the assassin, unlike in reality. A Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol with a 10-round magazine is shown as the assassination weapon, but the actual one had a 20-round magazine. The exact moment of assassination was never filmed. Just hours later, Chernozemski died in police custody.

The assassin was a member of the pro-Bulgarian Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO or VMRO) and an experienced marksman. Immediately after assassinating King Alexander, Chernozemski was cut down by the sword of a mounted French policeman, and then beaten by the crowd. By the time that he was removed from the scene, the King was already dead. The IMRO was a political organization that fought for the liberation of the occupied region of Macedonia and its independence, initially as some form of second Bulgarian state, followed by a later unification with the Kingdom of Bulgaria.

The IMRO worked in alliance with the Croatian Ustaše group, led by Ante Pavelić. Chernozemski and three Croatian accomplices had travelled to France from Hungary via Switzerland. After the assassination, Chernozemski&#x27;s accomplices were arrested by French police. A prominent diplomat with the Palazzo Chigi, Baron Pompeo Aloisi, expressed fears that the &quot;Ustashi&quot; based in Italy had killed the King and sought reassurances from another diplomat, Paolo Cortese, that Italy had not been involved. Aloisi was not reassured when Cortese told him that with Alexander being dead, Yugoslavia was about to break up.

Public opinion and press in Yugoslavia held that Italy had been crucial in the planning and directing of the assassination. Demonstrators outside of the Italian embassy in Belgrade and the Italian consulates in Zagreb and Ljubljana blamed Mussolini for Alexander&#x27;s assassination. An investigation by the French police quickly established that the assassins had been trained and armed in Hungary; had travelled to France on forged Czechoslovak passports; and frequently telephoned &quot;Ustaše&quot; leader Ante Pavelić, who was living in Italy.

The incident was later used by Yugoslavia as an argument to counter the Croatian attempts of secession and Italian and Hungarian revisionism. The participants in the assassination were Ivan Rajić, Mijo Kralj, Zvonimir Pospišil and Antun Godina. They were sentenced to life in prison although the Yugoslav authorities had expected that they would be sentenced to death. In 1940, after the fall of France, they were released from prison by Germany.

Pierre Laval, who succeeded Barthou as foreign minister, wished to continue the rapprochement with Rome and saw the assassinations in Marseille as an inconvenience that was best forgotten. Both London and Paris made it clear that they regarded Mussolini as a responsible European statesman and in private told Belgrade that under no circumstances would they allow &quot;Il Duce&quot; to be blamed. In a speech in Northampton, England, on 19 October 1934, British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon expressed his sympathy to the people of Yugoslavia over the king&#x27;s assassination and stated that he was convinced by Mussolini&#x27;s speech in Milan that denied being involvement in the assassination.

When Yugoslavia made an extradition request to Italy for Pavelić on charges of regicide, the Quai d&#x27;Orsay expressed concern that if Pavelić were extradited, he might incriminate Mussolini and were greatly reassured when its counterparts at the Palazzo Chigi stated there was no possibility of Pavelić being extradited. Laval cynically told a French journalist off the record that the French press should stop going on about the assassinations in Marseille because France would never go to war to defend the honour of a weak country like Yugoslavia.

The following day, the body of King Alexander I was transported back to the port of Split in Yugoslavia by the destroyer JRM &quot;Dubrovnik&quot;. After a huge funeral in Belgrade that was attended by about 500,000 people and many leading European statesmen, Alexander was interred in the Oplenac Church in Topola, which had been built by his father. The Holy See gave special permission to bishops Aloysius Stepinac, Antun Akšamović, Dionisije Njaradi, and Gregorij Rožman to attend the funeral in an Orthodox church. As his son King Peter II was still a minor, Alexander&#x27;s first cousin Prince Paul took the regency of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

A ballistic report on the bullets found in the car was made in 1935, but its results were not made available to the public until 1974. It revealed that Barthou was hit by an 8 mm Modèle 1892 revolver round commonly used in weapons, carried by French police.

After the assassination, relations between Yugoslavia and France became colder and never returned to the previous level. Also, the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact lost their importance. The Yugoslav public considered it shocking that the assassination had happened on French soil. In the coming years, Prince Paul (as regent) attempted to keep a neutral balance between London and Berlin until 1941, when he yielded to heavy pressure to join the Tripartite Pact.

<text>The Ted Lindsay Award, formerly known as the Lester B. Pearson Award, is awarded annually to the National Hockey League&#x27;s most outstanding player in the regular season as judged by the members of the NHL Players&#x27; Association. First awarded in 1971, it is a companion to the Hart Memorial Trophy, which is awarded to the League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, as judged by members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association. The award was renamed in 2010 after Ted Lindsay of the Detroit Red Wings.

==History==
The award was first handed out at the conclusion of the 1970–71 NHL season. It was named in honour of Lester B. Pearson, who was Prime Minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968, the recipient of the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize, and a former player and coach for the University of Toronto Varsity Blues men&#x27;s ice hockey team.

On April 29, 2010, the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association announced that the award would be reintroduced as the Ted Lindsay Award to honor Hall of Famer Ted Lindsay for his skill, tenacity, leadership, and role in establishing the original Players&#x27; Association. The voting for the trophy is conducted at the end of the regular season by the members of the NHL Players Association.

Wayne Gretzky won the award five times during his career. Members of the Edmonton Oilers have won the award 11 times, while members of the Pittsburgh Penguins won the award ten times. The Lindsay Award is considered to be the companion of the Hart Memorial Trophy—the trophies have been won by the same player for the same season 35 times (of the 52 seasons both have been awarded) by 22 players: Bobby Clarke, Phil Esposito, Guy Lafleur (x2), Gretzky (x5), Mario Lemieux (x3), Mark Messier (x2), Brett Hull, Sergei Fedorov, Eric Lindros, Dominik Hasek (x2), Jaromir Jagr, Joe Sakic, Martin St. Louis, Sidney Crosby (x3), Alexander Ovechkin (x2), Evgeni Malkin, Carey Price, Patrick Kane, Connor McDavid (x3), Nikita Kucherov, Leon Draisaitl, Auston Matthews, and Nathan MacKinnon. 13 of those players have also won the Art Ross Trophy for the same season a combined 23 times and completed a Hart-Pearson/Lindsay-Art Ross sweep: Esposito, Lafleur (x2), Gretzky (x5), Lemieux (x3), Jagr, St. Louis, Crosby (x2), Ovechkin, Malkin, Kane, McDavid (x3), Kucherov and Draisaitl. Hasek and Price are the only goaltenders to win the Hart and Pearson/Lindsay in the same year. Bobby Orr won the Norris, Pearson and Art Ross in 1974-75 and is the only defenceman to win the Pearson/Lindsay. Lafleur, Lemieux (x2) and Gretzky (x5), Ovechkin and McDavid have also all led the league in goal scoring in the years they won the Hart, Pearson/Lindsay and Art Ross; though only Ovechkin and McDavid won the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy which was introduced in 1998–99. Brett Hull, Ovechkin and Auston Matthews have also led the league in goals in years they won the Hart and Pearson/Lindsay (but not the Art Ross).

<doc id="269851" wikidata="Q167387" url="?curid=269851" title="Maria of Yugoslavia">
<text>Maria (born Princess Maria of Romania; 6 January 1900 – 22 June 1961), known in Serbian as Marija Karađorđević (), was Queen of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes from 1922 to 1929 and Queen of Yugoslavia from 1929 to 1934 as the wife of King Alexander I. She was the mother of King Peter II. Her citizenship was revoked, and her property was confiscated by the Yugoslav communist regime in 1947, but she was posthumously rehabilitated in 2014.

==Early life==
Maria was born on 6 January 1900, at Friedenstein Palace in Gotha, a town in Thuringia, in the German Empire. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, and was known as &quot;Mignon&quot; in the family to distinguish her from her mother. Her parents were Prince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen – Ferdinand I of Romania – and Princess Marie of Edinburgh. In her memoirs, Queen Marie of Romania wrote of her third child: 

In 1914, after the death of Carol I, her parents became King and Queen of Romania, and Maria moved with them to Romania, which became her new home country. During World War I, she worked as a nurse with her mother, along with her two sisters. Although plump, Maria was a noted beauty in her youth and resembled her sister, Elisabeth.

The family spent their holidays at Peleș Castle near Sinaia. In 1922, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia was invited to Peleș Castle, and introduced to Maria. Maria and Alexander fell in love, and were engaged with the support of Maria&#x27;s father Ferdinand I.

==Queen==
Maria married Alexander I, second King of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in Belgrade on 8 June 1922. The wedding took place at the Saint Michael&#x27;s cathedral. The wedding was given big international publicity at the time. Since Maria was related to the British royal family, the British Crown was represented by the Duke of York, who attended the wedding as witness.

On 3 October 1929, Maria became Queen of Yugoslavia when Alexander changed the name of the country. The royal couple settled at the Karađorđević estate in Oplenac near Topola. Since the new Royal Residence in Belgrade was not finished, the king and queen continued to live at the Karađorđević estate. Queen Maria established good relations with the Orthodox clergy and engaged in charity. At the Karađorđević estate, Maria participated in the work of the local peasantry at the royal estate, and could be seen working in the field dressed in traditional folk costume. She founded schools for the children of the local farmers, scholarships for the benefit of poor students and cooperated with the church to help poor families. Her first son was given a traditional royal Serbian name, her second son was given a Croatian name and her third son was given a Slovenian name to create unity in the new state of Yugoslavia. Her sons played with the children of the workers on the estate. The simple life of Maria gave her a great deal of favourable publicity, and her popularity also benefitted Alexander, when she and sometimes the sons accompanied him on his trips around Yugoslavia.

Maria was well educated. She spoke several languages fluently and enjoyed painting and sculpting under the guidance of artist Iva Despić-Simonović. She also drove a car by herself, which was very unusual for royalty at the time.

Following the assassination of her husband, King Alexander I, in Marseille in 1934, her oldest son, aged only 11, became Peter II of Yugoslavia and was the last reigning Yugoslav king. Her son, being a minor, was placed under the regency of his uncle, Prince Paul. The regent gave Maria an allowance of six million dinars for herself and her sons: she kept a quarter of the amount, and spend the rest on charity. Queen Maria initially kept participating in royal representation as a widow. Her first assignment as a widow was a campaign against tuberculosis.

After the death of Alexander, Maria suffered from a deteriorating state of rheumatism. In 1938, she bought a farm in Gransden in Bedfordshire north of London in England. In 1939, she moved permanently to her house in England: she took her younger sons with her, but was obliged to leave her eldest son in Yugoslavia because of his position as monarch. It was rumoured at the time that Maria left Yugoslavia because of a conflict with the Prince Regent Paul, but the official reason stated for her move was her health. She was given the title Queen Mother of Yugoslavia in 1941.

==Later life==
Yugoslavia declared itself neutral at the outbreak of World War II. On 25 March 1941, however, Prince Paul declared Yugoslavia an ally of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. On 27 March, Peter II deposed Prince Paul as regent. On 6 April, Nazi Germany attacked Yugoslavia, and Peter II fled to Britain, arriving in June. Maria suggested that she should return to Yugoslavia to stand by the Yugoslav people during the war, but was prevented by her health problems from doing so.

During the war, Maria provided relief help for Yugoslav prisoners of war in Nazi custody through the Red Cross in Britain. To avoid being identified by the Germans as a sender, she gave the name of Mary Djordjevic as the sender of the packages, but she was identified by the Yugoslav prisoners.

On 29 November 1945, the monarchy was abolished in Yugoslavia. Her son, Peter II, settled in the United States. Maria herself bought a new farm in Kent, where she lived a simple life with her two younger sons, often seen working in the fields. She chose not to use her contacts as a relative of the British royal family. She engaged in the Yugoslav community in London, as well as her interest in art, and studied at the Byam Shaw School of Art and participated in several exhibitions with her art work.

She died at her home in exile in Chelsea, London on 22 June 1961, aged 61. Her funeral was held on 2 July 1961 at the Serbian Orthodox Church, Notting Hill, London and was initially interred at the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore, which adjoins Windsor Castle. Her remains were transferred to Serbia in April 2013 and reinterred on 26 May 2013 in Oplenac, Serbia.

==Family==
Maria and Alexander I had three sons:

*King Peter II (6 September 1923 – 3 November 1970) ∞ Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark
*Prince Tomislav (19 January 1928 – 12 July 2000) ∞ Princess Margarita of Baden ∞ Linda Mary Bonney (1949 - 2013)

<doc id="269856" wikidata="Q1584069" url="?curid=269856" title="St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport">
<text>St. Pete–Clearwater International Airport is a public/military airport in Pinellas County, Florida, United States, serving the Tampa Bay Area. It is right on the northeast municipal boundary of Pinellas Park, north of downtown St. Petersburg, southeast of Clearwater, and southwest of Tampa.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2023–2027 categorized it as a small-hub primary commercial service facility. In 2014, it showed double-digit growth and handled more than one million passengers, setting a record.

Most scheduled airline traffic in the Tampa Bay Area uses Tampa International Airport (TPA), east, but St. Pete–Clearwater remains a destination for low-cost carriers. St. Pete–Clearwater is a focus city for Las Vegas–based Allegiant Air. The airport is also less busy than Tampa and is frequently used by pilots of private planes and executive jets.

The airport uses &quot;Tampa Bay The Easy Way&quot; as an advertising slogan and &quot;Fly2PIE&quot; in reference to its three-letter IATA and FAA codes.

==History==
The airport is on the west shoreline of Tampa Bay, six miles (10 km) north of St. Petersburg, Florida (the &quot;birthplace of commercial air transportation&quot;). Barely a decade after the pioneer flight of the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk in 1903, the first tickets for airline travel were sold by the St. Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line of Tony Jannus to fare-paying passengers. Using a Benoist XIV amphibious aircraft, the inaugural flight took place from a location near the downtown St. Petersburg Pier. Mayor Abram C. Pheil of St. Petersburg and Mae Peabody of Dubuque, Iowa, were the first passengers, flying across the bay to Tampa and, according to a United Press account, reportedly reaching the maximum speed of during the flight. Other reports indicate that they reached an altitude of .

This was the beginning of commercial air transportation anywhere in the world and is commemorated by a replica of the Benoist aircraft and a plaque at the airport terminal baggage claim area. Another replica is displayed at the St. Petersburg Museum of History adjacent to the Pier. Since 1991, the terminal holds the archives of the Florida Aviation Historical Society.

===Construction and wartime===
Construction of the airport at its present site started in March 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the airport was acquired by the United States Army Air Forces, which used it as a military flight training base assigned to Third Air Force.

The 304th Fighter Squadron, a combat training unit of the 337th Fighter Group based P-40 Warhawks and, later, P-51 Mustangs at Pinellas Army Airfield (as it was then known) for the duration of World War II. Antisubmarine patrols against German U-boats in the Gulf of Mexico were also flown from the airfield.

To commemorate the airport&#x27;s vital role during that conflict, a plaque was dedicated at the airport terminal in 1994 by the P-51 Fighter Pilots Association and Brigadier General James H. Howard, who was the only European Theater fighter pilot to be awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II and later served as the last wartime base commander of Pinellas Army Airfield. A permanent exhibit honoring General Howard is located in the terminal.

===Postwar operation===
After World War II, the property was returned to Pinellas County by the U.S. government to operate as a civil airport. It was originally called Pinellas International Airport and given the IATA designation, PIE, which it still uses, because PIA was already taken by Peoria International Airport. In 1958, the name was changed to St. Petersburg–Clearwater International Airport because, according to airport manager &quot;Bobo&quot; Hayes, tourists didn&#x27;t know where Pinellas County was.

The airport was the original home to two of the first scheduled air freight airlines in the United States, U. S. Airlines (dating to 1946) and Aerovias Sud Americana (1947), which was also known as ASA International Airlines. U. S. Airlines had domestic routes to the northern cities, whereas ASA had routes to Latin America. One of ASA&#x27;s specialities was flying livestock, and consequently the airport had animal pens to allow ASA to assemble the animals they were flying south.

===Airline service: 1950s to mid-2000s===

During the 1950s until the mid 1960s, several major U.S. airlines served both St. Petersburg–Clearwater (PIE) and Tampa International Airport (TPA), including Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines and Northwest Airlines. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide lists 17 airline departures from PIE: ten by Eastern, six by National and one by Mackey Airlines. Four departures flew nonstop beyond Florida, including an Eastern Douglas DC-4 to Chicago and a Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation to Pittsburgh. In 1956, Mackey Airlines Douglas DC-4s flew to Nassau, Bahamas, via Tampa and Fort Lauderdale. In 1959, a National Airlines Douglas DC-7B flew to New York City Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport) and Boston via Jacksonville. In 1960, Delta was operating &quot;Flying Scot&quot; Douglas DC-6s on a St. Petersburg - Atlanta - Knoxville - Cincinnati - Chicago Midway Airport routing.

With the advent of the jet age, runway 17/35 was extended north into Tampa Bay; the first scheduled jets were Northwest Airlines Boeing 720Bs from Chicago in late 1961 (the 1961 Aviation Week directory says PIE&#x27;s longest runways were 5,700 feet, but it appears 17/35 was 8,000 feet when the 720B arrived). The increased capacities of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 jets prompted the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to approve consolidation of airline service for the Tampa Bay area at TPA in the early 1960s.

In 1963, Northwest was flying Lockheed L-188 Electra propjet service Miami–Fort Lauderdale–St. Petersburg–Atlanta–Chicago O&#x27;Hare–Minneapolis/St. Paul–Fargo, ND–Grand Forks, ND–Winnipeg, Canada. Eastern was the last scheduled airline at PIE during the mid-1960s and it ended flights from the airport in 1964. The year before, Eastern had been operating prop flights from St. Petersburg nonstop to Charlotte, Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport, Cleveland and Louisville as well as direct one-stop service to Columbus, OH, Detroit and Indianapolis.

Scheduled air service returned to PIE in 1972, when Air Florida began intrastate airline flights to Miami and Orlando with Boeing 707s. Air Florida replaced its 707s with Lockheed L-188 Electras out of PIE, and in 1974 was flying nonstop to Miami, Orlando and Tallahassee. According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), only one airline was serving St. Petersburg in the fall of 1979: regional air carrier Red Carpet Airlines operating Convair 440 prop aircraft five days a week nonstop from Miami and two days a week nonstop from Grand Cayman in the Caribbean. According to the OAG, by 1981 the airport still had only one air carrier operating scheduled passenger service: commuter airline Sun Air operating small Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante turboprops with one weekday nonstop flight from Miami as well as one weekday nonstop flight from nearby Tampa.

Jet service returned in 1982 with Northeastern International Airways flying Douglas DC-8 nonstop flights to Long Island MacArthur Airport in Islip, New York. By 1983, Northeastern was flying Boeing 727-100 nonstop flights to Fort Lauderdale and New Orleans, in addition to its nonstop service to Islip. Also in 1983, People Express was flying nonstop to New York/Newark Liberty International Airport with Boeing 727-200s, 737-100s and 737-200s. Locally based regional air carrier Atlantic Gulf Airlines was flying Vickers Viscount turboprops nonstop to Miami in 1983, and by 1984 was operating Convair 580 turboprops to Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Tallahassee. By 1984, Northeastern had added nonstop West Palm Beach jet flights as well as direct jet flights to Hartford/Springfield, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Little Rock, Oklahoma City, San Diego and Tulsa. People Express then expanded its flights from the airport, and in 1985 was flying nonstop to Charlotte and New York/Newark as well as operating direct, no change of plane jet service to Boston, Detroit and Syracuse. Also in 1985, Florida Express British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets were serving PIE with four daily nonstops to its Orlando hub with direct flights to Columbus, OH, Fort Lauderdale, Indianapolis and Nashville via Orlando. In 1987, American Airlines initiated nonstop mainline jet flights to its Raleigh-Durham hub while Midway Airlines (1976-1991) commenced nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet flights in 1988 from its Chicago Midway Airport hub with direct one stop service from Cleveland; however, by October 1989 PIE once again had no scheduled airline service.

American Trans Air (ATA) and Air South began jet flights from PIE in the 1990s. In the fall of 1991, American Trans Air was the only airline serving the airport with just three nonstop Boeing 727 flights a week from Indianapolis. By early 1994, ATA was operating nonstop Boeing 757-200s from Chicago Midway Airport, nonstop Boeing 727-200s from Indianapolis, nonstop Boeing 727-200s from Milwaukee and weekly nonstop wide body Lockheed L-1011 TriStars from Philadelphia. By late 1994, American Trans Air had expanded its service and was operating domestic nonstop service to Fort Lauderdale and St. Louis as well as international nonstop flights to Nassau, Bahamas, in addition to its flights to Chicago Midway, Indianapolis and Milwaukee. ATA was primarily operating Boeing 727-200 jets on these services in late 1994 but was also operating larger Boeing 757-200 jetliners on some nonstop flights between the airport and Chicago Midway at this time as well. In the summer of 1995, Air South was flying nonstop Boeing 737-200 jet service to Atlanta, Columbia, SC, Miami and Tallahassee. The Air South service to Miami in 1995 included up to five 737 nonstops on weekdays while at the same time commuter air carrier Gulfstream International Airlines was operating twice daily nonstop flights to Miami with small Beechcraft 1900C turboprops. In 1997, Reno Air was operating &quot;Gulf Coast Flyer&quot; service nonstop to Gulfport/Biloxi with McDonnell Douglas MD-80s. By 1999, the OAG listed four airlines operating jets to St. Petersburg: American Trans Air Boeing 727-200 nonstops from Chicago Midway Airport and Indianapolis, Canada 3000 Airbus A320 nonstops from Toronto, Nations Air Boeing 737-200 nonstops from Gulfport/Biloxi and Royal Aviation Boeing 757-200 nonstops from Toronto. Also in 1999, Air Transat, a Canadian-based scheduled and charter airline, was operating wide body Lockheed L-1011 TriStar jets on its flights into the airport. In the late spring of 2004, Southeast Airlines was operating nonstop McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jet service from the airport to Allentown, PA (ABE), Columbus, OH (LCK), Gary, IN (GYY), and Newburgh, NY (SWF). Southeast Airlines went out of business in the fall of 2004, while Air South had previously ceased serving the airport back in 1996, and subsequently went out of business as well. 

According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), five airlines were operating jet service into the airport in the spring of 2005 including two U.S.-based air carriers and three Canadian-based air carriers with ATA Airlines (formerly American Trans Air) operating Boeing 757-200 as well as Boeing 757-300 nonstop flights from Chicago Midway Airport (MDW) and Indianapolis (IND), CanJet operating nonstop Boeing 737-500 flights from Halifax, Nova Scotia (YHZ) and Hamilton, Ontario (YHM), Jetsgo operating Fokker 100 as well as McDonnell Douglas MD-83 nonstop flights from Toronto (YYZ), Skyservice Airlines operating nonstop Airbus A320 flights also from Toronto (YYZ), and USA 3000 Airlines operating nonstop Airbus A320 flights from Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport (ORD), Cleveland (CLE), Detroit (DTW), New York Newark Airport (EWR), Philadelphia (PHL), Pittsburgh (PIT) and St. Louis (STL).

===Recent developments===
In September 2006, Allegiant Air announced scheduled service from St. Petersburg–Clearwater to cities in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Allegiant&#x27;s destination count from PIE has since increased to 59 airports in the eastern United States. In February, the Lansing, Michigan service shifted to Grand Rapids, Michigan, with four weekly flights. Allegiant operates Airbus A319 and A320 jets on its flights from the airport.

In 2009, the airport completed a US$22 million renovation, including, among other things, larger gates, new plumbing, and building passenger jet bridges.

In January 2015, Silver Airways announced it was beginning service to PIE, but in March the company had cancelled its plans.

As of 2021, the airport is planning to convert decommissioned runway 9/27 into a taxiway to enhance service for air carriers, the U.S. Coast Guard, and Pinellas County Sheriff&#x27;s Office aircraft.

==Facilities==
The airport covers 1900 acres (769 ha) at an elevation of 11 feet (3 m). It has two asphalt runways: 18/36 is 9,730 by 150 feet (2,966 x 46 m) with an ILS approach, and 04/22 is 6,000 by 150 feet (1,829 x 46 m).

The airport is also the home of Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, the largest and busiest U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in the United States, operating HC-27J Spartan and MH-60T Jayhawk aircraft.

The U.S. Army Reserve also maintains an Army Aviation Support Facility (AASF) at PIE immediately west of the approach end of Runway 17R for Companies A and F, 5th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment and Medical Evacuation Unit, operating UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters.

The airport and its tenants employ over 3,000 people and have an economic benefit of more than $400 million yearly to the Tampa Bay area.

The airport has a 24-hour airport rescue and fire-fighting (ARFF) department (Index C), along with operations, facilities, engineering, security, and administrative personnel.

<text>Sherborne is a market town and civil parish in north west Dorset, in South West England. It is sited on the River Yeo, on the edge of the Blackmore Vale, east of Yeovil. The parish includes the hamlets of Nether Coombe and Lower Clatcombe. The A30 road, which connects London to Penzance, runs through the town. In the 2021 census the population of Sherborne was 10,361.

Sherborne&#x27;s historic buildings include Sherborne Abbey, its manor house, independent schools, and two castles: the ruins of a 12th-century fortified palace and the 16th-century mansion known as Sherborne Castle built by Sir Walter Raleigh. Much of the old town, including the abbey and many medieval and Georgian buildings, is built from distinctive ochre-coloured ham stone.

The town is served by Sherborne railway station.

==Toponymy==
The town was named &quot;scir burne&quot; by the Saxon inhabitants, a name meaning &quot;clear stream&quot;, after a brook that runs through the centre of the town, and is referred to as such in the Domesday Book.

==History==

In 705 the diocese of Wessex was split between Sherborne and Winchester, and King Ine founded an abbey for St Aldhelm, the first Bishop of Sherborne, which covered Dorset, Somerset, and Devon. King Alfred the Great&#x27;s elder brothers, King Æthelbald and King Æthelberht, are buried in the abbey. The large Sherborne diocese lasted until about 909 when it was further sub-divided into three sees, with Sherborne covering Dorset. In 933, King Æthelstan granted land at Sherborne to the nuns of Shaftesbury Abbey under the condition that they would recite the Psalter once a year on All Saints&#x27; day and say prayers for the king. The bishop&#x27;s seat was moved to Old Sarum in 1075 and the church at Sherborne became a Benedictine monastery. In 1437 the Abbey was damaged by fire after tensions between the town and the monastery came to a head, but much of the Norman structure stands today. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1539, the vacated monastery buildings were bought by Sir John Horsey and became the parish church. Sherborne was the centre of Sherborne Hundred for many centuries.

In the 12th century Roger de Caen, Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England, built a fortified palace in Sherborne. During the English Civil War, the palace was destroyed in 1645 by General Fairfax. Its ruins are now owned by English Heritage.

In 1594 Sir Walter Raleigh built an Elizabethan mansion in the grounds of the old palace, today known as Sherborne Castle.

Sherborne became home to Yorkshireman Captain Christopher Levett, who came to the West Country as His Majesty&#x27;s Woodward of Somersetshire, and who remained in Sherborne when he turned to a career as a naval captain and early explorer of New England.

==Governance==
In the UK national parliament, Sherborne is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency. , the Member of Parliament (MP) is Edward Morello of the Liberal Democrats. 

In local government, Sherborne is in the Dorset unitary authority at the highest tier. Sherborne elects 2 members to Dorset Council from two electoral wards, Sherborne East and Sherborne West. A third electoral ward, Sherborne Rural, contains the rural hinterland and surrounding villages, but none of Sherborne parish itself.

At the lower tier of local government, Sherborne is a civil parish with a 12-member parish council, which styles itself as Sherborne Town Council.

Historically, Sherborne was in Sherborne Hundred, and became a borough in 1227. It was an urban district from 1894 to 1974. A separate rural district council, Sherborne Rural District, administered the surrounding parishes during this period, but did not include the town itself. From 1974 to 2019, Sherborne was in West Dorset district.

==Education==

There has been a school in Sherborne since the time of King Alfred, who was educated there. The school was re-founded in 1550 as King Edward&#x27;s grammar school, using some of the old abbey buildings, though it is now known simply as Sherborne School. The school is one of the independent schools in Britain, with alumni such as Cecil Day-Lewis, Alan Turing, Jeremy Irons, Chris Martin, John le Carré, Hugh Bonneville and John Cowper Powys. Sherborne School operates Sherborne International, a school which seeks to integrate international students into the British public school tradition.

Leweston School was founded as St. Anthony&#x27;s in 1891 by the Sisters of Christian Instruction, Sacred Heart nuns from Belgium with Jesuit principles, who originally operated a full boarding school for girls in Sherborne town. The senior school moved to the Leweston Manor estate in 1948 and became known as St Antony&#x27;s-Leweston; in 1993 the Preparatory school, which has since grown to include a nursery, followed. Leweston transitioned from a girls only school to fully co-educational in all years during a four-year transitional period from 2018 to 2021. The 2022 ISI inspection report described the quality of pupils&#x27; personal development in the senior school as excellent. The early years provision was described as outstanding in every category of inspection. Notable alumnae include businesswoman and conservative life peer Dido Harding, Baroness Harding of Winscombe and actresses Kristen Scott Thomas and Serena Scott Thomas
Sherborne School for Girls, often simply known as Sherborne Girls was founded in 1895. Its notable alumnae include the opera singer Emma Kirkby and the scientist Rosa Beddington.

Sherborne Preparatory School is located opposite Sherborne School, and many of its pupils choose to go on to Sherborne School or Sherborne Girls.

Until 1992 there were also two grammar schools, Foster&#x27;s School for Boys and Lord Digby&#x27;s School for Girls. Both schools merged with another local school to form The Gryphon School.

The town also has two primary schools, Sherborne Abbey Primary School and Sherborne Primary School.

Other notable historic buildings in the town include the 1405 Hospice of St Julian; and No. 101 Newland, built in 1297; and St Emerenciana&#x27;s Chapel (now Nethercoombe Farm), built in the late 14th century and the only building in the country to have been dedicated to this saint. Also listed is the Conduit, originally built in the Abbey Cloister in 1520 as the monks&#x27; wash place before it was moved to the market place in 1560.

<text>A Perfect Circle is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. A Perfect Circle released three of their four studio albums in the early 2000s: their debut &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; in 2000, a follow-up, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; in 2003; and an album of radically re-worked cover songs, &quot;Emotive&quot;, in 2004. Shortly after &quot;Emotive&quot;″s release, the band went on hiatus; Keenan returned to Tool and started up solo work under the band name Puscifer, while Howerdel released a solo album, &quot;Keep Telling Myself It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, under the moniker Ashes Divide. Band activity was sporadic in the following years; the band reformed in 2010, and played live shows on and off between 2010 and 2013, but fell into inactivity after the release of their greatest hits album, &quot;Three Sixty&quot;, and a live album box set, &quot;A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo&quot; in late 2013. The band reformed in 2017 to record a fourth album, &quot;Eat the Elephant&quot;, which was released in 2018. After spending the rest of the year touring in support of the album, the band fell into inactivity until 2024 for a brief tour and one-off song &quot;Kindred&quot;.

Prone to downtime due to Keenan&#x27;s other musical commitments, the band has featured a variety of musicians throughout alternating periods of activity and inactivity, and has changed line-ups on each album, leaving Keenan and Howerdel the only constant members. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Tim Alexander on drums. Alexander, however, only performed a handful of live shows and appeared on one song on the group&#x27;s debut album before being replaced by Josh Freese. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and bassist Jeordie White were also members for a short period in the early 2000s. The band&#x27;s current lineup features Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the primary roles of creating A Perfect Circle&#x27;s songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan writing lyrics and vocal melodies. The band&#x27;s studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their first three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; (1999–2000)===
A Perfect Circle was originally conceived by Billy Howerdel, a former guitar technician for Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins, Fishbone and Tool. Howerdel met singer Maynard James Keenan in 1992, when Tool was opening for Fishbone, and the two became friends. Three years later, Keenan offered Howerdel, who was looking for lodging, a room in his North Hollywood home. This provided Howerdel the opportunity to play demos of his music for Keenan. Pleased with what he heard, Keenan remarked, &quot;I can hear myself singing [those songs].&quot; Howerdel originally wanted Cocteau Twins lead singer Elizabeth Fraser to be A Perfect Circle&#x27;s vocalist, but she was unavailable. Howerdel agreed that Keenan would be a good fit, and A Perfect Circle was formed a short time later. The two rounded out the band&#x27;s initial lineup with bassist and violinist Paz Lenchantin, former Failure guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, and Primus drummer Tim Alexander. The band played their first show in Los Angeles at the Viper Club Reception in August 1999 followed by a performance at the Coachella Festival that October, by which time Alexander had been replaced by Josh Freese, who worked with Howerdel on Guns N&#x27; Roses recording sessions that would later lead to the album &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. While initially in talks to release the album on Volcano Records – Tool&#x27;s record label – Keenan stated that they instead chose to go with Virgin Records, who Keenan felt better understood that Keenan meant for the band to be an equally important band to Tool, not a minor side project. After the initial shows and securing a record deal, the band entered the studio to begin work on their first album.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; (French for &quot;Sea of Names&quot;), was released on May 23, 2000. The album was well-received commercially and critically. It debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 188,000 copies in its first week and making it the highest-selling debut album for a rock band. &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; was later certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating 1 million copies sold, on October 31, 2000. The release earned the band the &quot;Best Debut Album&quot; award from the California Music Awards. In the album review by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Pat Blashill wrote that Keenan &quot;added an almost operatic angst to Howerdel&#x27;s songs&quot; and concluded that &quot;A Perfect Circle sound like a desperate dream of what rock used to be. Maybe that&#x27;s the point.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s review expressed that &quot;there&#x27;s little question that the addicting combination of Keenan&#x27;s aching voice and Howerdel&#x27;s accomplished songs and production skills made for one of 2000&#x27;s best splashes in whatever was left of &#x27;modern rock&#x27;.&quot;

Promotions began shortly after recording for the album was finished. Initially, they served as the opening act for Nine Inch Nails on the 2000 &quot;Fragility v2.0&quot; tour, but subsequently embarked on a number of headlining tours all over the world, touring for around eight months straight. In public appearances with the group, Keenan often wore wigs, carrying over a practice begun with Tool of wearing costumes in order to maintain anonymity in his private life. The album produced three singles as well: &quot;Judith&quot;, &quot;3 Libras&quot;, and &quot;The Hollow&quot;, the latter of which featured Alexander&#x27;s sole studio contribution to the band. All three performed well commercially; peaking at fourth, twelfth, and fourteenth on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart respectively.

===&quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; (2001–2003)===
Activity began slowing down for the band by late 2000, with Keenan returning to Tool to finish the recording of what would be their next album, &quot;Lateralus&quot;. Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle to tour from January to March 2001, until returning to Tool again for the rest of 2001 to release and tour in support of &quot;Lateralus&quot;. Initial plans were for Howerdel to collaborate long-distance on writing new A Perfect Circle material with Keenan while he toured with Tool, by sending ideas back and forth to one another, though Keenan found it too difficult to balance both, eventually lessening his role while he focused on Tool. Efforts continued through mid-2002, with Howerdel primarily focusing on writing new material while sporadically working with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese. By June 2002, Van Leeuwen estimated that about 80% of the instrumental material was completed while they waited for Keenan&#x27;s return. However, lineup changes and disagreements on the album&#x27;s direction would lead to the album not being released for over a year. Both Lenchantin and Van Leeuwen had been working on solo material during the band&#x27;s downtime, and then moved on to join other bands. Lenchantin would leave to join Billy Corgan&#x27;s new start-up band Zwan in April 2002, while Van Leeuwen began touring with Queens of the Stone Age shortly after. Ex-Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White, formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez, replaced Lenchantin on bass in January 2003. Shortly after, Van Leeuwen permanently left the band, and long-time band collaborator Danny Lohner filled in temporarily as the second guitarist for wrapping up the album.

Keenan rejoined the sessions in early 2003, and the music began taking a different direction with the new lineup and Keenan&#x27;s influence. Beyond the new personnel, the dynamic had changed: With &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, Howerdel had already written and finalized all of the music, with Keenan just contributing the lyrics and vocals. This time around, Keenan was more active in vetoing or altering musical ideas, determined to make something different than just another hard rock album, in fear of it being redundant. Sessions became tense, with Howerdel preferring the heavier compositions written while waiting for Keenan to return to the band, and sometimes taking offense to Keenan&#x27;s suggested mellower rearrangements. White would play the role of a mediator between the two; being newer to the band helped him provide an outsider&#x27;s perspective, helping them to find common ground. The band released their second album, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, on September 16, 2003. The album debuted even higher than &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, charting at number 2 in its opening week and selling over 233,000 copies. The album, and its accompanying new sound, fared well critically as well. The AllMusic review praised the band&#x27;s new sound, describing it as &quot;moodier, tenser, and more atmospheric (if that is possible) recording than its predecessor ... The wide dynamic swathes that were so prominent on the band&#x27;s debut are all but absent here. The squalling guitars have taken a backseat to carefully crafted melodies where atmospherics are maximized and pulled taut over the listener. While not a radical departure from &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, there is a real progression here... Lyrically, musically, sonically, the &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it.&quot;

Touring in support of the album started in the U.S. in July 2003, and ran through the end of the year, with a brief European leg of the tour extending out to Europe with the Deftones in September. Lohner, who could not commit to touring on a full-time permanent basis, was replaced by former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha. In January 2004, the group left the country to play shows in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. They headed back to the U.S. in March and wrapped up touring in June, totaling to about a year straight of touring. Meanwhile, three singles were released from the album: &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; managed to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Songs, while &quot;The Outsider&quot; later peaked in the top 5 of both as well. &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; and &quot;The Outsider&quot; were also the band&#x27;s only songs to have substantial cross-over success, charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 all-format chart, at 61 and 79 respectively.

===&quot;Emotive&quot; (2004)===
After wrapping up the touring in support of &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; in the first half of 2004, the band had announced it planned to enter a long while Keenan returned to Tool and Howerdel pursued a solo career. In July 2004, Keenan performed at Serj Tankian&#x27;s (System of a Down) and Tom Morello&#x27;s (Rage Against the Machine) Axis of Justice concert – an event for musicians to advocate for political and social causes. At the performance, Keenan announced that A Perfect Circle would be releasing a collection of political cover songs. During the beginning of the touring cycle for &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, Howerdel and Keenan discussed potential ideas for a third studio album. An early idea was to record an album of cover songs, though they were initially hesitant, feeling they needed a meaningful reason to warrant doing it. Keenan, who had been very critical of President George W. Bush during the touring cycle, proposed tying the concept together as a political-themed covers album, with Howerdel, while generally apolitical publicly, felt was worth pursuing in their post-September 11th attacks political and social climate. The two put their plans on hold temporarily and decided to move forward on the project as the band&#x27;s third studio album. Keenan emphasized that, despite his personal feelings on Bush, the album was less of an &quot;anti-Bush&quot; album, and more of an &quot;anti-political apathy&quot; – encouraging people to research things and become more involved.

The band rushed to complete the album in time to release it prior to the 2004 U.S. Presidential Elections in November, just barely a year after their prior release. Recording sessions ran from late June to early September. The sessions, largely the work of Howerdel, Keenan, and Freese, contained contributions from past and present members of the band, including Lenchantin, Lohner, White, and Iha. Keenan, aware of the time constraints and Howerdel&#x27;s future intentions on doing solo albums, also encouraged Howerdel to contribute lead vocals to about a third of the album. A wide variety of different songs were chosen to be recorded, from Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;. Most songs were radical reinterpretations of the original, sometimes unrecognizable compared to the originals. Howerdel explained that it was done on purpose, to make the songs their own, and conceded that he, as of 2010, still had not even once ever heard the original version of Crucifix&#x27;s &quot;Annihilation&quot;, another song re-recorded for the album. He also stated that some songs had started as original A Perfect Circle songs musically, until the band decided to use the lyrics of other songs over the compositions, in turn converting them into cover songs.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Emotive&quot;, was released on November 2, 2004 – the actual U.S. Presidential Election Day. However, the album received a much more polarizing reception than the prior two albums, with some critics and fans not appreciating the band&#x27;s move into more political content, or the radical liberties they had taken with the album&#x27;s cover versions. Others accused the band of rushing out a third album in order to fulfill the band&#x27;s three album contractual obligation to Virgin Records, a claim refuted as false by Howerdel. The album still managed to receive a generally positive reception from critics. Sales were similarly positive, but less so than prior albums. The album debuted at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, selling 142,000 copies in its first week – matching &quot;Thirteenth Step&#x27;s&quot; peak chart placement, but selling almost 90,000 fewer copies. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA, indicating 500,000 units sold.

The band did not tour in support of the release, instead entering a hiatus shortly after its completion. Two singles were released in support of the album, the first of which was a somber cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; The second single, &quot;Passive&quot;, was one of just two original songs on the album, tracing back to writing sessions for Trent Reznor&#x27;s unreleased Tapeworm project. In the late 1990s, Reznor started the project for songs that did not fit Nine Inch Nails, which eventually grew into a collaborative project with a number of other musicians. One track, &quot;Vacant&quot;, featured contributions from Keenan and Lohner in 1999, but with the project hitting development hell due to creative and legal hurdles of many of the participants in the early 2000s, A Perfect Circle began playing the track at live shows. With the project being shelved completely by 2004, Keenan decided to rework the track as &quot;Passive&quot; for &quot;Emotive&quot;. Additionally, two weeks after the release of the album, on November 16, 2004, the band released the CD/DVD compilation set entitled &quot;Amotion&quot;. The DVD part contained the music videos for band six singles; while the CD is composed entirely of remixes of the singles from &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; and &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;.

===Hiatus and other projects (2005–2009)===
The band entered a hiatus in January 2005, with members turning to their own separate projects. Keenan rejoined Tool to record what would be 2006&#x27;s &quot;10,000 Days&quot;, Howerdel began pursuing a solo career, and the rest joined various other touring or sessions recording roles. The band&#x27;s fate remained uncertain in the following years. It was referred to as &quot;hiatus or done until further notice&quot; by Howerdel in October 2005, on &quot;life-support&quot; by Keenan in April 2006, and &quot;done for now&quot; by Howerdel in May 2006. Towards the end of 2007, Keenan spoke more optimistically about the band reforming someday, but felt that it would probably be in a more limited capacity – for a tour or a new single release, not another full-length studio album. Keenan explained:
During the time, Howerdel continued to work on projects with various past A Perfect Circle members. In 2005, he wrote and composed the soundtrack to &quot;Jak X: Combat Racing&quot;, collaborating with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese on a number of tracks. Howerdel continued to work on recording a solo album from 2005 through 2007; the sessions were difficult, so he eventually began collaborating with past A Perfect Circle members, including Lohner as a producer, Freese as a drummer, and Lenchantin as a co-writer for a track. The material was eventually released under the name Ashes Divide on the album &quot;Keep Telling Myself It&#x27;s Alright&quot; in early 2008. Meanwhile, Keenan had moved on from working with Tool, and started up a solo-project of sorts on his own, called Puscifer, of which he began releasing studio albums for in 2007. Despite both projects going, both Keenan and Howerdel released statements in 2008 that the band was not dead.

===Reformation, touring, compilation releases (2010–2016)===

As early as December 2008, Keenan had mentioned that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new material for A Perfect Circle, although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of the view of the public through mid-2010. The turning point was an unexpected collaboration between Keenan and Howerdel; Keenan was scheduled to perform a rendition of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; with Queen guitarist Brian May in June at E3 2010, but May had to cancel at the last minute. In need of a guitarist, and knowing Howerdel was in the area, Keenan reached out, and had Howerdel play guitar for the performance at the last minute. Despite little time to prepare, the performance was a success, and afterwards, both felt more compelled to perform together again.

In September, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums – &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, and &quot;Emotive&quot; – notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material was in a state of flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.

The band continued their live performances into 2011, including a North American tour that spanned May through August. Notable events included Rock on the Range, Edgefest, Ottawa Bluesfest, Kanrocksas Music Festival, Lollapalooza, a performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Freese, who had already committed to drumming for Weezer during the same time-frame, was only able to perform at the opening show, and was replaced by Jeff Friedl for the remainder of the shows, who, like McJunkins, had previously worked with both Ashes Divide and Puscifer. Keenan and Howerdel continued to allude to recording new music, but continued to state that the process was slow, the logistics of money and availability made it difficult, and that a full album was still unlikely, in favor of single songs instead. Only one new song, &quot;By and Down&quot;, was performed at the shows. By the end of the year, Keenan revealed that none of the material was ready for release, and that moving into 2012, he and Howerdel were moving back into their respective other projects – Puscifer and Ashes Divide. The band was inactive over the course of 2012, outside of a single live show in December. However, just prior to the show, in October 2012, Freese announced he would be permanently leaving the band, with Friedl becoming his permanent replacement.

The band played a few live shows in early 2013, including Soundwave Music Festival in Australia and Lollapalooza Chile, though Keenan reported that they had still yet to complete any new tracks due to their other commitments. Later in the year, the band announced two separate compilation releases for November 2013. The first, a greatest hits album entitled &quot;Three Sixty&quot;, containing one new studio recording, &quot;By and Down&quot;, and the second, a box set entitled &quot;A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo&quot;. The box set contained four CDs of live music: one for each of their three entire-album performances of &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, and &quot;Emotive&quot; done in 2010, collectively dubbed &quot;Trifecta&quot;, and a recording of their 2011 performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, dubbed &quot;Stone and Echo&quot;. The set also came with DVD video recording of the 2011 &quot;Stone and Echo&quot; performance. In promoting the releases, Howerdel commented on future releases once again, stating that he felt they had &quot;75% of the foundation of [the next] A Perfect Circle record ready&quot;, though he conceded that they were still without Keenan&#x27;s lyrics or vocal melodies, and could still change depending on Keenan&#x27;s reaction to the material. He also conceded that they still disagreed on the release medium; Keenan preferred smaller releases, while Howerdel preferred the format of a full album. Shortly after, the band again fell into a few years of public inactivity, with little occurring outside of Howerdel&#x27;s 2015 commentary reiterating his commitment to the band, and Keenan&#x27;s early 2016 commentary reiterating he still hoped to return to the band.

===&quot;Eat the Elephant&quot; (2017–2018)===

The band became active again in 2017, with the announcement that they would reform to embark on a North American tour in April and May 2017, with the intention of using the live performances of new material as motivation to finish recording the album, similar to how they had embarked on their first 1999 tour to inspire the completion of &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;. In March, the band announced they had signed a new record contract – their first in thirteen years – to release a fourth full-length studio album through BMG Rights Management. Howerdel initially gave a tentative timeframe of between November 2017 to early 2018 for the new album, while Keenan stated that the album wouldn&#x27;t be out in 2017. A second North American tour began in October, and runs through December 2017. The band continued to debut new songs during the tours, including the tracks &quot;Feathers&quot; and &quot;Hourglass&quot;.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Eat the Elephant&quot;, was released on April 20, 2018. Four singles were released in advance of the album; &quot;The Doomed&quot; in October 2017, &quot;Disillusioned&quot; in January 2018, &quot;TalkTalk&quot; in February 2018 and &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; in April 2018. The album marks the first time the band opted to work with an outside music producer: Dave Sardy. Sardy helped Keenan and Howerdel find common ground in musical ideas in the recording process, helping them find a path to move forward in finishing the album. The band toured extensively in 2018 in support of the album, including performances at Rock on the Range and Coachella. In June 2018, the band extended their touring with a new North American leg towards the end of the year, and released a 2D hologram video for the song &quot;The Contrarian&quot;. Iha was unavailable to perform in the April through July performances due to his commitment to the Smashing Pumpkin&#x27;s 2018 reunion, and was temporarily replaced for the live performances by Greg Edwards of Failure, though Iha still remains a member of the band.

===Future (2019–present)===
Howerdel noted that he would like to see the band keep active beyond the &quot;Eat the Elephant&quot; album cycle, but that future activity, as it had historically been, was dependent on Keenan&#x27;s limited availability and commitments to his other projects. When asked if there would be further albums after &quot;Eat the Elephant&quot;, in June 2018, Keenan responded &quot;Yeah, there should be&quot;. Howerdel was optimistic as well, agreeing that the band &quot;will move forward for sure&quot;. In late 2021, Keenan noted that while he still saw a future for A Perfect Circle, that 2022 would be more focused on him working with Puscifer and Howerdel releasing a solo album, &quot;What Normal Was&quot;. While supporting &quot;What Normal Was&quot; in 2022, Howerdel reiterated plans to make more A Perfect Circle music someday, noting that it was something he was thinking about and occasionally writing material for, but that there were no concrete plans, nor had he even began talking to Keenan about it yet. 

The band played a series of live performances for the first time since 2018 in April 2024, alongside Puscifer and Primus. On March 29, 2024, the band released their first new song in 6 years - &quot;Kindred&quot;. The song was released as part of a three-way split EP, &quot;Sessanta E.P.P.P.&quot;, which contains one song each from A Perfect Circle, Puscifer, and Primus. Freese returned to the band for the first time in 13 years to record drums for the track, and to perform on some of the tour dates with Gunnar Olsen of Puscifer filling in when Freese had to bow out due to his Foo Fighters commitments.

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==
The band&#x27;s music has been described as a number of different genres, though despite the sound changes and lineup changes, the writing process has remained the same for the band; Howerdel primarily writes the band&#x27;s instrumental music, while Keenan contributes the lyrics and vocal melodies. Keenan, already very well known for his work with fronting the band Tool through the 1990s, always strove to keep the sound of two bands different:

Howerdel has similarly described A Perfect Circle as a more emotional, vulnerable, and feminine approach to music than Tool. He has cited among his influences, several albums that had a strong effect on his way of playing: Adam Ant&#x27;s &quot;Kings of the Wild Frontier&quot;, for its &quot;weird hybrid of pirate music and American Indian influence&quot;, Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; &quot;Tinderbox&quot; as &quot;one of the spookiest records I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot; and for its &quot;dense atmosphere&quot;, Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; as &quot;Randy Rhoads has been a huge influence for me, especially when I was starting out&quot; and finally the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Pornography&quot;, which he described as &quot;another spooky atmospheric record&quot; and &quot;one of the scariest albums I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;.

Tracy Frey of AllMusic described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;an extension of the alt-metal-fused-with-art rock style popularized by Tool in the early to mid-&#x27;90s. While similar to Tool in intensity and melancholy, A Perfect Circle is less dark and more melodic, with a theatrical, ambient quality that incorporates occasional strings and unusual instrumentation. While Keenan referred to the band first album, &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, as more of a hard rock album, for subsequent albums, out of fear of redundancy, he often pushed for a more mellow, atmospheric sound, something he and Howerdel did not always see eye to eye on, creating a sound noted to be similar to merging heavy rock music with &quot;Disintegration&quot;-era The Cure music. In general, common genre classifications applied to labeling the band&#x27;s music include alternative rock, alternative metal, hard rock, art rock, art metal, progressive rock and progressive metal. The band has also been lumped in with the nu metal genre, a label that is cited due to the band&#x27;s rise to fame coinciding with the genre&#x27;s movement towards more melodic heavy material similar to A Perfect Circle&#x27;s sound, and its use was contested by many publications.

Both A Perfect Circle and Tool have been widely hailed as major influences on modern rock. In a 2015 retrospective, VH1 noted that, &quot;at some point sounding like Tool became a subgenre of rock. Although that is a little misleading as many of these bands were actually ripping off A Perfect Circle, because of its easier-to-grasp melody and simpler rhythms.&quot; Reviewers from outlets such as AllMusic and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; and &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; as rare examples of relevance and quality in contemporary rock music. Online music magazine musicOMH asserted the band had &quot;literally defined alternative rock as we know it.&quot;

<text>Carl William Mays (November 12, 1891 – April 4, 1971) was an American baseball pitcher who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1915 to 1929. During his career, he won over 200 games, 27 in 1921 alone, and was a member of four World Series-champion teams. On August 16, 1920, Mays threw the pitch that fatally injured Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians, the only major league player to die as a direct result of an on-field injury.

==Playing career==
According to his World War I draft card, Carl William Mays was born November 12, 1891, in Atterson, Kentucky, one of five sons born to Callie Louisa Mays and William Henry Mays. His father was a Methodist minister, and was responsible for his strict religious upbringing. When Mays was 12, his father died and his mother moved the family to Kingfisher, Oklahoma, to live near her sister-in-law. Mays internalized his grief, settling into a surly persona with few if any close friends. His best personal support group was a couple named Pierce and Genevieve Mays, who were relatives and served as a surrogate uncle and aunt. As a professional baseball player, he had few friends in the baseball world. In part because of his strict Methodist upbringing, Mays refused to pitch on Sundays, as did legendary pitcher Christy Mathewson.

Mays quit high school before graduating and began to earn a living as a baseball player on semi-pro teams in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Utah. In 1912, he entered the minor leagues as a member of the Boise, Idaho, team in the Class D Western Tri-State League. After a season in Boise, in 1913 Mays played one season for the Portland, Oregon, team in the Class A Northwest League. In 1914, Mays was drafted by the Triple-A International League&#x27;s Providence Grays. The Grays were an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, and the Tigers sold his contract to the Boston Red Sox.

In one version of the story, Mays learned his underhand style of pitching from Dizzy Dismukes, a pitcher in Negro league baseball. In another, he was taught the technique by Joe McGinnity when McGinnity coached the Tacoma team during Mays&#x27;s stint with Portland. Mays was nicknamed &quot;Sub&quot;, a reference to his submarine pitching motion, and he was known to throw a spitball. The pitch was legal at the time of the Chapman incident, but Chapman&#x27;s death was partly responsible for its ban in Major League Baseball (although the ban wouldn&#x27;t take effect until 1921). Mays was also known for a habit of throwing inside to any batter who hugged the plate; despite a stellar win–loss record, he was typically among the American League leaders in hit batsmen. Mays was also regarded as an exceptional fielder, and was capable enough with the bat that he was often used as a pinch-hitter.

In his rookie season of 1915, Mays appeared in 34 games for the Red Sox. Used mostly in relief, he won 6 games and lost 5. During the regular season, Mays was involved in a heated confrontation with Ty Cobb of the Tigers. Mays threw near Cobb each time he came to bat. In the eighth inning, after another close pitch, Cobb threw his bat in Mays&#x27; direction, calling him a &quot;no good son of a bitch&quot;. Mays responded by calling Cobb a &quot;yellow dog&quot;. After order was restored, Mays hit Cobb directly on the wrist. The Tigers won the game 6–1 and the incident cemented Mays&#x27; reputation as a head hunter. The Red Sox won that year&#x27;s World Series by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in five games, but Mays did not play.

In 1916, Mays appeared in 44 games, and started 24. 18 of his starts were complete games, and he posted a record of 18 wins and 13 losses, with an earned run average of 2.39. In the 1916 World Series, Mays was the losing pitcher in Game 3, but the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins 4 games to 1. In 1917, The Red Sox posted a second-place finish. Mays pitched in 35 games, and his record was 22 wins and 9 losses, with an ERA of 1.74. Mays went 22–13 in the 1918 season, with an ERA of 2.21. The Red Sox returned to the World Series, and defeated the Chicago Cubs in 6 games. Mays was the winning pitcher in games 3 and 6, both by scores of 2–1.

Mays married for the first time shortly after the end of the 1918 season. After a brief honeymoon in Missouri, he departed by train from his home in Mansfield for St. Louis as the leader of a group of 18 men who had enlisted in the United States Army for World War I. They were sworn in on November 6, five days before the Armistice that ended that war. Influenza broke out while Mays was stationed at Washington University in St. Louis as a member of the Student Army Training Corps&#x27;s vocational training unit, and several individuals from his train trip died during the outbreak. The Armistice ended the need to expand the Army, and Mays was discharged in time to begin the 1919 baseball season.

Though he was by now established as one of the game&#x27;s premier pitchers, Mays began the 1919 season with a record of five wins and eleven losses. His slow start resulted in the Red Sox trading him to the New York Yankees that July. Mays went 9–3 after the trade, resulting in a combined 1919 record of 14–14. Mays regained his form in 1920. The Yankees finished in third place, but posted a record of 95 wins and 59 losses, only three games out of first place. Mays went 26–11, including 26 complete games.

==Death of Ray Chapman==
The Yankees were trailing the Indians when Ray Chapman came to the plate in the fifth inning on August 16, 1920. Mays was pursuing his 100th career win that day. Chapman had a sacrifice bunt in the first inning and popped up to Yankee first baseman Wally Pipp in the third. Angered that Chapman was crowding the plate, Mays let loose with a high fastball that he claimed was in the strike zone but that Chapman apparently never saw. The impact of the ball striking Chapman in the head was so loud that Mays, thinking it had hit Chapman&#x27;s bat and was in play, caught the ball as it bounced onto the field and threw it to Pipp at first base. Chapman, trying to take his base after the hit by pitch, fell to the ground twice and was unable to get up. Cleveland teammate Tris Speaker raced from the on-deck circle to check on Chapman. He was joined by several players from the Indians and Yankees. Mays, however, never left the mound.

Chapman was taken to a hospital, where surgeons operated and discovered a skull fracture. He initially seemed to rally after the surgery but died early in the morning on the following day. Mays stayed in the game and continued to pitch until being replaced in the ninth inning. Cleveland won the game 4–3. The New York District Attorney determined that the incident was an accident, and no charges were filed.

In an interview three months after Chapman&#x27;s death, Mays expressed regret for the outcome, but he stated that he did not feel any guilt, as he had not hit Chapman on purpose; indeed, one of Chapman&#x27;s last words before losing consciousness was &quot;I&#x27;m all right; tell Mays not to worry&quot;. Mays received the wrath of many opposing players, who believed he beaned Chapman deliberately. Chapman had been one of the few players that Ty Cobb was on friendly terms with, so Cobb was the most vocal critic, suggesting that someone should give Mays a taste of his own medicine by hitting Mays with a pitch the same way Mays hit Chapman.

==Later career==
Mays enjoyed his best season in 1921, when he led the American League in wins (27), innings pitched (), games pitched (49), and winning percentage (.750). However, that same season Mays, pitching for the Yankees, played in a World Series that others later accused him of helping to throw, bringing back memories of the Black Sox scandal from just two years prior. These rumors were never proven, but they persisted long enough that, combined with an already negative reputation among other players both from the Chapman incident and from having a personality that few found agreeable, he was never elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame despite having lifetime statistics comparable to some other pitchers who were.

In a 15-year career with the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Giants, Mays compiled a 207–126 record with 29 shutouts, 862 strikeouts and a 2.92 earned run average when the league average was 3.48. He won twenty or more games five times. He was also noted for his skills with a bat, hitting five home runs, recording 110 runs batted in, and sporting a lifetime .268 batting average—an unusually high mark for a pitcher. Mays is the only Red Sox pitcher to toss two nine-inning complete game victories on the same day, as he beat the Philadelphia Athletics 12–0 and 4–1 on August 30, 1918. Those wins put the Red Sox one step from clinching the league championship, as they led Cleveland by games with four remaining to play.

==Later years and death==
After his playing career, Mays was the owner and operator of a baseball school in Oregon; among his most notable attendees was Johnny Pesky. Mays also worked as a scout for the Cleveland Indians, Milwaukee / Atlanta Braves, and Kansas City Royals. In addition, his stepson, Jerry Bartow, coached baseball at Hoover High School in San Diego, and each spring Mays made the trip from Oregon to volunteer as a mentor and assistant coach. In an interview, Mays said he especially enjoyed working with young pitchers, but that he regarded his most important task as teaching members of the team how to play the game safely.

He died on April 4, 1971, in El Cajon, California, and is buried in River View Cemetery, Portland, Oregon (Sec. 13, Lot 49, Sp. 7).

==Family==
After the 1918 World Series, Mays married Marjorie Fredricka Madden, a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music whom he had met during his rookie season. They were the parents of two children, Carl Jr. (1925–2017) and Elizabeth (Betty). His second wife was Esther Ugstead (1907–1990). All-Star pitcher Joe Mays, who played for the Minnesota Twins, Kansas City Royals, and Cincinnati Reds from 1999 to 2006, is a distant cousin of Mays.

==Legacy==
In August 2008, Mays was one of the 10 former players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. He was named on only about 25 percent of the ballots, so he was not selected for induction.

In 2021, indie-folk artist Cousin Wolf released a song entitled &quot;Carl Mays&quot; as part of an album called &quot;Nine Innings.&quot;

<text>Outward Bound (OB) is an international network of outdoor education organisations that was founded in the United Kingdom by Lawrence Holt in 1941 based on the educational principles of Kurt Hahn. Today there are organisations, called schools, in over 35 countries which are attended by more than 150,000 people each year. Outward Bound International is a non-profit membership and licensing organisation for the international network of Outward Bound schools. The Outward Bound Trust is an educational charity established in 1946 to operate the schools in the United Kingdom. Separate organisations operate the schools in each of the other countries in which Outward Bound operates.

Outward Bound helped to shape the U.S. Peace Corps and numerous other outdoor adventure programs. Its aim is to foster the personal growth and social skills of participants by using challenging expeditions in the outdoors.

==History==

=== Founding and early history ===
The first Outward Bound school was opened in Aberdyfi, Wales in 1941 by Lawrence Holt with financial support from the Blue Funnel Line shipping company based on the initiative of Kurt Hahn. The name Outward Bound was derived from the nautical term for a ship leaving safe harbour for the open sea. Outward Bound grew out of Hahn&#x27;s work in the development of the Gordonstoun school and what is now known as the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award. Outward Bound&#x27;s founding mission, during the Second World War, was to improve the survival chances of young seamen should their ships be torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic.

James Martin Hogan served as warden for the first year of the school. This mission was established and then expanded by Capt. J. F. &quot;Freddy&quot; Fuller who took over the leadership of the Aberdyfi school in 1942 and served the Outward Bound movement as senior warden until 1971. Fuller had been seconded from the Blue Funnel Line following wartime experience during the Battle of the Atlantic of surviving two successive torpedo attacks and commanding an open lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for thirty-five days without losing a single member of the crew.

An educational charity, named The Outward Bound Trust, was established in 1946 to operate the school. A second school followed in England at Eskdale Green in 1950. The first Outward Bound program for women was held in 1951. During the next decade, several other schools opened around the United Kingdom. A school in Lumut, Malaysia opened in 1954, the first outside the United Kingdom. Outward Bound Australia was founded in 1956. The first Outward Bound USA course was run in Puerto Rico in 1961 for the Peace Corps, which it helped to shape. Outward Bound New Zealand was founded in 1962, Outward Bound Singapore established in 1967 and Outward Bound Hong Kong in 1970. Outward Bound Costa Rica was founded in 1991.

From the inception of Outward Bound, community service was an integral part of the program, especially in the areas of sea and mountain rescues and this remains an important part of the training for both staff and students. During the period 1941 to 1965 in the United Kingdom, the philosophy of the schools evolved from &quot;character‐training&quot; to &quot;personal growth&quot; and &quot;self‐discovery&quot;.

Aberdyfi remains the organisation&#x27;s &quot;nerve-centre&quot; in the United Kingdom. Over the course of a summer in 2010, 7000 to 8,000 students attended courses at the Aberdyfi centre and more than a million young people have attended Outward Bound courses in the UK since 1941. Prince Philip served as the Patron of the Outward Bound Trust for several years before handing over to his son Prince Andrew, who resigned in November 2019.

=== Current ===
Outward Bound International was founded as a non-profit organisation in 2004 to license the use of the brand name &quot;Outward Bound&quot; and to provide support for the international network of schools. Today there are organisations, called schools, in more than 35 countries with 250 wilderness and urban locations around the world which are attended by more than 250,000 students each year. Separate organisations operate the schools in each of the countries in which Outward Bound operates.

Since its founding in the middle of the last century, Outward Bound has encouraged individuals to test their physical and emotional limits in challenging outdoor adventure programs. The experiences are a means of building inner strength and a heightened awareness of human interdependence. Outward Bound&#x27;s compass rose emblem serves as the logo for almost all the schools around the world.

==Blue Peter nautical flag==

The name Outward Bound derives from a nautical expression that refers to the moment a ship leaves the harbour. This is signified by Outward Bound&#x27;s use of the nautical flag, the Blue Peter (a white square inside a blue square). JF Fuller adapted the Outward Bound motto, &quot;To Serve, To Strive and not To Yield,&quot; from the poem &quot;Ulysses&quot; by Alfred Lord Tennyson:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;... Come, my friends.
Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are --
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Course specifics==

Outward Bound courses follow a kind of recipe or formula, termed the &quot;Outward Bound Process Model&quot; which is well described by Walsh and Golins (1976) as:

# Taking a ready, motivated learner
# into a prescribed, unfamiliar physical environment,
# along with a small group of people
# who are faced with a series of incremental, inter-related problem-solving tasks
# which creates in the individual a state of dissonance requiring adaptive coping and
# leads to a sense of mastery or competence when equilibrium is managed.
# The cumulative effect of these experiences leads to a reorganisation of the self-conceptions and information the learner holds about him/herself.
# The learner will then continue to be positively oriented to further learning and development experiences (transfer).

In a typical class, participants are divided into small patrols (or groups) under the guidance of one or more instructors. The first few days, often at a base camp, are spent training for the outdoor education activities that the course will contain and in the philosophy of Outward Bound. After initial confidence-building challenges, the group heads off on an expedition. As the group develops the capacity to do so, the instructors ask the group to make its own decisions.

<doc id="269868" wikidata="Q597631" url="?curid=269868" title="Orlando Sanford International Airport">
<text>Orlando Sanford International Airport is in Sanford, Florida, United States, near Orlando. It was built as Naval Air Station Sanford, a Master Jet Base for carrier-based attack and reconnaissance aircraft, and was used by the U.S. Navy until 1969. The airport is owned and operated by the Sanford Airport Authority. It serves as an operating base for Allegiant Air. 

Sanford is Orlando&#x27;s secondary commercial airport, and is farther away from downtown Orlando and Walt Disney World than the primary airport, Orlando International Airport (MCO/KMCO). Because of the affiliation with Orlando, passenger traffic at Sanford was once dominated by European charter services.

Since 2008, however, a majority of its passenger traffic has been domestic; this is attributable to the entrance of Las Vegas–based Allegiant Air, for which Sanford is a focus city. Sanford was also a small focus city for the travel marketer Direct Air until the company&#x27;s demise in 2012.

==History==
===Naval Air Station Sanford===

Orlando Sanford International Airport started life as Naval Air Station Sanford with the airport codes NRJ and KNRJ. Commissioned on November 3, 1942, the base initially concentrated on advanced land-based patrol plane training. It was used by the United States Navy until it closed in 1969.

===Orlando Sanford International Airport===
The City of Sanford assumed control of the former NAS Sanford in 1969 and renamed the facility Sanford Airport, hiring the air station&#x27;s recently retired Executive Officer, Commander J. S. &quot;Red&quot; Cleveland, USN (Ret.), as the first Airport Manager. The city concurrently established the Sanford Airport Authority. For the next twenty-five years, the airport was a general aviation facility and periodically hosted civilian/military air shows and static displays. Initially an uncontrolled airfield, the control tower was reactivated in the early 1970s as a non-FAA facility, employing a number of retired enlisted Navy air traffic controllers who had served at NAS Sanford.

Additional name changes followed, to include Sanford Regional Airport, Central Florida Regional Airport, Orlando Sanford Regional Airport and the current Orlando Sanford International Airport. Through the 1980s and 1990s the oldest Navy buildings were demolished while those built in the 1950s and 1960s were renovated for civil use. New buildings and hangars were added.

OLF Osceola was transferred to the control of Seminole County, Florida, but was never officially recommissioned as an active airfield. In the 1970s the former OLF began to be used by general aviation drug-smuggling aircraft as a transshipment point. Following a major drug interdiction by local and federal law enforcement agencies, Seminole County placed large speed bumps at various intervals across the runways to deter future illegal use. By the 1980s the county began to use the site as a landfill and dump, demolishing the remaining runways.

====1990s====

In 1992, parts of the action film &quot;Passenger 57&quot;, starring Wesley Snipes, were filmed at the then-Orlando Sanford Regional Airport, where it represented a small airport in Louisiana. Shortly after filming, a new control tower was built and air traffic control operations assumed by the FAA. The Navy control tower and the large Navy hangar to which it was attached were demolished.

In the mid-1990s, a new passenger terminal capable of accommodating jet airliners was built. Charter airlines catering to the heavy British tourist demographic that had previously been using Orlando International Airport were offered greatly reduced landing fees at Sanford, and therefore many carriers relocated their operations.

In 1996, Michael Jackson and his team did the first rehearsals of the HIStory World Tour between July and August 1996 before going to Prague.

====2010–present ====

In 2010, Allegiant Air announced it was moving many flights to the larger and more centrally located Orlando International Airport in order to compete with AirTran Airways. Owing to passenger feedback, all flights have returned to Orlando Sanford.

In 2014, Thomas Cook Airlines moved their operations back to Orlando International Airport after almost a decade of serving Orlando Sanford with the operations of Airtours, JMC Air &amp; My Travel. In September 2019, Thomas Cook ceased all operations. 

Icelandair moved to Orlando International Airport in 2015.

In October 2017, Monarch Airlines ceased operations, after entering administration, therefore resulting in the termination of their flights to Sanford. All flights were operated using their Airbus A330 and served London Gatwick, Manchester and Glasgow International.

In April 2016, Interjet operated flights to Mexico City. It later switched operations to the main Orlando airport from May 2018.

In 2017, Thomson Airways (now TUI Airways) began operating routes to UK airports. This was the largest international airline at the airport having served eight destinations around the UK. However, in November 2019, TUI Airways announced that from 2022, it would switch their Orlando operations from Sanford to Melbourne Orlando International Airport including the daily flights to/from those 8 British airports. This will bring their operations nearer to Port Canaveral where TUI Cruises will operate from in coming years. As a package holiday company this brings passengers closer to their cruises, although it has angered many TUI passengers who fly with the company to visit Orlando for Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort.

In July 2021, Canadian low-cost carrier Flair Airlines announced they would launch service between Sanford and five Canadian destinations beginning in winter 2021.

In 2025, the airport announced it had attracted $300 million in proposed development to expand its services and offerings.
==Facilities==
The airport covers 3,000 acres (1,214 ha) and has four runways:

* Runway 9L/27R: 11,002 x 150 ft. (3,353 x 46 m), asphalt
* Runway 9C/27C: 3,578 x 75 ft. (1,091 x 23 m), asphalt
* Runway 9R/27L: 5,839 x 75 ft. (1,780 x 23 m), asphalt
* Runway 18/36: 6,002 x 150 ft. (1,829 x 46 m), asphalt/concrete

The dominant runway is 9L/27R. This was built from the naval air station&#x27;s original Runway 9/27, which was x with overruns of and . A project to extended runway 9L/27R by to was completed on April 1, 2013. Parallel Runways 9C/27C and 9R/27L were built later, the former on a previous taxiway and the latter all-new, for small aircraft. The airport also has Runway 18/36, another Navy runway, for rare northerly fronts in the winter, but this 6000-ft runway is rarely used by airliners.

In 2024, the airport secured a $13 million loan to improve on key infrastructure projects to enhance operations. Plans include an extension to runway 9L/27R as well as a rehabilitation of the terminal ramp, with both planned for completion in late 2026. The plan also includes expansions to car parking lots, which would see 1,000 additional spaces.

On December 31, 2019, there were 326 aircraft based at this airport: 221 single-engine and 53 multi-engine airplanes, 48 jet, and 4 helicopters.

The airport is home to L3 Harris Airline Academy, which underwent several company changes and several name changes. The academy used to be known as L3 Commercial Training Solutions, Aerosim Flight Academy, and Delta Connection Academy, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines. It provides flight training for prospective regional airline and international pilots. The Seminole County Sheriff&#x27;s Office has a hangar and support facility for aviation elements of the agency&#x27;s Special Operations Division.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On March 29, 2007, Allegiant Air Flight 758, a McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft that took off from Pease International Airport in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, experienced a hydraulic failure that prevented the nose landing gear from deploying. The plane made a safe landing at Orlando Sanford International Airport, with only one minor injury sustained in the aircraft evacuation.
*On July 10, 2007, a Cessna 310, originating from Daytona Beach International Airport, Florida, en route to Lakeland Linder International Airport, Florida, crashed into two homes in Sanford, Florida, killing five people: the pilot, his passenger, and three people inside the houses. The pilot reported smoke in the cockpit and attempted an emergency landing at nearby Orlando Sanford International Airport. NASCAR said the pilot of the plane was Michael Klemm, a senior captain with NASCAR Aviation. His passenger was Dr. Bruce Kennedy, husband of International Speedway Corporation president Lesa France Kennedy, herself the daughter of the longtime head of NASCAR Bill France, Jr., who had died a month earlier in June 2007. They were the only two people on the plane, according to both NASCAR and the NTSB. Four people also were injured, three of whom were critically burned, authorities said. The NTSB factual report dated December 2007 indicates that the accident was caused by an electrical malfunction, including smoke in the cockpit, that occurred on the previous flight and that was not rectified prior to the accident flight, resulting in the subsequent fire. The accident pilot was informed about the known problem prior to flight but elected to fly the aircraft regardless.

<text>Blood of Amber is a fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, published in 1986. It is the second book in the second &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series, and the seventh book overall in the Amber series.

==Plot summary==
Merlin escapes from the crystal cave, and decides to gain leverage over Luke by rescuing his mother from the Keep of the Four Worlds. He spars with the sorcerer who now controls the keep, and who seems to know him. He escapes with the petrified Jasra, and returns to Amber where an unusual Trump summoning imprisons him in the Mad Hatter&#x27;s tea party.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Blood of Amber&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #97, and stated that &quot;despite a few good wisecracks and neat ideas, Corey&#x27;s plethora of powers can&#x27;t revitalise the over-familiar Amber gimmickry and revenge plot&quot;.

<doc id="269879" wikidata="Q769644" url="?curid=269879" title="Strong Motion">
<text>Strong Motion (1992) is the second novel by American author Jonathan Franzen.

&quot;Strong Motion&quot; was noted by reviewers for its impassioned social criticism, the thoroughness of its research, and its treatment of controversial themes such as abortion, feminism, corporate malfeasance and exploitative capitalism.

==Plot summary==

Louis Holland arrives in Boston to find that a minor earthquake in Ipswich has killed his eccentric grandmother, triggering a struggle between him, his sister Eileen, and his mother Melanie over the disposition of a $22 million inheritance. During a visit to the beach, Louis meets Dr. Reneé Seitchek, a Harvard seismologist who believes she has discovered the cause of subsequent earthquakes in Peabody. Louis, Reneé, and the Hollands&#x27; affairs become entangled with the petrochemical and weapons company Sweeting-Aldren, as well as an anti-abortion activist commune called the Church of Action in Christ, headed by Reverend Philip Stites.

==Critical reception==

Reception to the book was mostly positive, with critics applauding its style, ambition, and riskiness; the &quot;New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the stuff of several books crammed into one long, dense narrative about contemporary urban America&quot;. Negative criticism focused on a perceived lack of focus, and an attempt to interweave too many plot threads—the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;Franzen writes beautifully for the most part, though sometimes to excess&quot;.

During an interview in 2015, Stephen King said that Franzen is one of his favorite novelists working today, particularly because of King&#x27;s admiration for &quot;Strong Motion&quot;.

<doc id="269880" wikidata="Q879228" url="?curid=269880" title="Blue Cliff Record">
<text>The Blue Cliff Record () is a collection of Chan Buddhist kōans originally compiled in Song China in 1125, during the reign of Emperor Huizong, and then expanded into its present form by Chan master Yuanwu Keqin (1063–1135; ).

The book includes Yuanwu&#x27;s annotations and commentary on &quot;100 Verses on Old Cases&quot; (), a compilation of 100 kōans collected by Xuedou Chongxian (980–1052; , &quot;&quot;). Xuedou selected 82 of these from &quot;The Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp&quot;, with the remainder selected from the &quot;Yunmen Guanglu&quot; (, &quot;Extensive Record of Yunmen Wenyan&quot;, 864–949).

==History==
===Name and origin===
The &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; derives its name from the temple where Yuanwu Keqin wrote most of his commentaries, the Blue Cliff Cloister (碧巖院, &quot;Bìyán Yuàn&quot;) in Hunan. The work was originally called Xuedou&#x27;s &quot;Juko&quot; (&quot;ju&quot;, verse; &quot;ko&quot;, old koans) before its &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; title was attributed.

Yuanwu first presented it as a series of lectures to his students between 1111 and 1117. It appears these lectures occurred during the traditional 90-day summer retreats, as can be seen from his introduction to the 100th Case, where he writes: &quot;All summer I&#x27;ve been verbosely making up complications... and tripping up all the monks in the land.&quot; Written a hundred years before &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;, the Blue Cliff Record contains appended verses to each &quot;koan&quot;, added by Xuedo to point out their hidden meaning. Yuanwu &#x27;s commentaries were added to tempt students trying to understand Zen conceptually and intellectually instead of by their own immediate experience.

The composite work consisting of the one hundred cases, along with poetry added by Xuedou and prose commentary by Yuanwu, is collectively known as the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;.

===Later developments===
Yuanwu&#x27;s successor, Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163), wrote many letters to lay students teaching the practice of concentrating on koans during meditation, but Dahui did not explain and analyze koans. Oral tradition holds that Dahui noticed students engaged in too much intellectual discourse on koans, and then burned the wooden blocks used to print the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; to &quot;rescue disciples from delusion&quot;. 

The text was reconstituted only in the early 14th century by a layman, Zhang Mingyuan (, &quot;&quot;). One of Zhang&#x27;s sons became ill during this time, and others believed that it was an omen meaning that Zhang should not have re-released the book. However, an elder named Feng Zizhen () comforted Zhang and encouraged him for his work. Some of Yuanwu&#x27;s capping phrases and possibly some of Xuedong&#x27;s capping phrases were lost due to the incomplete source material available to Zhang.

On its republication, the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; again became one of the most influential works of Zen literature.

===Dogen and Japan===
Another key legend regards Dōgen (1200–1253), who brought the Caodong school of Chan to Japan as the Sōtō sect of Zen. After an extended visit to China for the purpose of studying Chan, on the night before his planned return to Japan, Dogen came across the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; for the first time, and stayed up all night making a handwritten copy of the book. Given the size of the book, this story is most likely apocryphal; but Dogen is still credited with introducing the collection to Japan, where it had a wide circulation. The &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; became the central text in Japanese Zen by the Muromachi period of 1336 to 1573.

==Literary qualities==
The &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; was a subtle and literary text, with wide-ranging philosophical implications, in contrast to the more straightforward nature of &quot;The Gateless Barrier&quot;. &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; is normally studied before &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; because it is a shorter, simpler text, but all the cases in both texts are independent and could be studied in any sequence.

==List of chapters==
Below is a list of the 100 cases (koans) in the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; from Thomas Cleary&#x27;s 1998 English translation of the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot;. Traditionally, the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; is organized into 10 volumes, each containing 10 cases.

<doc id="269881" wikidata="Q2470280" url="?curid=269881" title="Sign of Chaos">
<text>Sign of Chaos is a fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, published in 1987. It is the third novel in the second &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series, and the eighth book overall in the Amber series. The title of this book mirrors that of &quot;Sign of the Unicorn&quot;, the third book in the first Amber series.

==Plot summary==
Merlin realises that Wonderland, where he and Luke are trapped, is an LSD-induced hallucination made real by Luke&#x27;s powers over shadow. As a Fire Angel (a vicious creature from Chaos) pursues them, he administers medicine to Luke. The Fire Angel is weakened in a fight with the Jabberwock and Merlin is able to finish it off with the vorpal sword. He leaves Luke to sober up.

He seeks his stepbrother Mandor, who thinks that their half-brother Jurt may be trying to kill Merlin in order to take the throne of Chaos. Fiona contacts them, and they investigate a shadow-storm. Merlin and Mandor return to Amber, and then along with Jasra they wrest the Keep of the Four worlds from Jurt and the sorcerer, Mask. They learn that Jurt has (at least partially) turned himself into a living Trump, as Brand did, and that the sorcerer Mask is in fact Merlin&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Julia.

==Reception==
H. J. Kirchoff of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that Zelazny &quot;serves up his usual mixture of fast action and slick dialogue, and blends in enough mystery, magic, intrigue and love interest to keep the kettle simmering.&quot; Dennis O&#x27;Shea of &quot;United Press International&quot; wrote that the novel is &quot;well-stocked with the wry wit and expansive imagination that endear Zelazny to his readers&quot;, even if its &quot;complexities&quot; are &quot;not handled quite as deftly as we have come to expect from Zelazny.&quot; Drew Bittner of the &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot; called the novel &quot;well written&quot; and wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s worth buying the next book just to see how Zelazny will tie up all the threads into a whole tapestry.&quot;

<doc id="269882" wikidata="Q1205829" url="?curid=269882" title="Scottish Episcopal Church">
<text>The Scottish Episcopal Church (; ) is a Christian denomination in Scotland. Scotland&#x27;s third largest church, the Scottish Episcopal Church has 303 local congregations. It is also an ecclesiastical province of the Anglican Communion.

A continuation of the episcopalian &quot;Church of Scotland&quot; as intended by James VI, and as it was from the Restoration of Charles II to the re-establishment of Presbyterianism in Scotland following the Glorious Revolution, it recognises the archbishop of Canterbury of the Church of England as president of the Anglican Instruments of Communion, but without jurisdiction in Scotland &quot;per se&quot;. Additionally, while the British monarch holds the title of Supreme Governor of the Church of England, in Scotland the monarch maintains private links to both the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Scottish Episcopal Church. The church is led by a Primus, who is elected from the seven Bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church from among their number to serve as a &quot;primus inter pares&quot; or ‘first among equals’ as the Senior Bishop. The current primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church is Mark Strange, elected in 2017.

In terms of official membership, Episcopalians constitute well under 1 per cent of the population of Scotland, making them considerably smaller than the Church of Scotland or the Catholic Church in Scotland. The membership of the church in 2023 was 23,503, of which 16,605 were communicant members. The attendance at Sunday worship, as counted on Sunday next before Advent was 8,815. This compares with the figures from six years previously, in 2017, where church membership had been 30,909, of whom 22,073 were communicant members, and there was a Sunday worship attendance of 12,149.

==Official name==

The Scottish Episcopal Church was previously called the Protestant Episcopal Church in Scotland, simplified at the General Synod of 1838 to Episcopal Church in Scotland.

Although not incorporated until 1712, the Scottish Episcopal Church traces its origins including but extending beyond the Reformation and sees itself in continuity with the church established by Ninian, Columba, Kentigern, and other Celtic saints. The Church of Scotland and the Catholic church claim the same continuity.

The church is sometimes pejoratively referred to in Scotland as the &quot;English Kirk&quot;, but this can cause offence. This is probably in part due to the fact that it is, nonetheless, a union of the non-juring Episcopalians with the &quot;qualified congregations&quot; who worshipped according to the liturgy of the Church of England. It is also sometimes known as the &quot;Laird&#x27;s Kirk&quot; because of its historical associations with the landed aristocracy of Scotland whose membership of the church exceeded that of other denominations. In the mid 1800s it was recorded that three quarters of the &quot;landed proprietors of Scotland&quot; were Episcopalians.

==History==
===Origins of Christianity in Scotland===
The fifth-century Saint Ninian conducted the first Christian mission to what is now southern Scotland.

In 563 AD, Saint Columba travelled to Scotland with twelve companions, where according to legend he first landed at the southern tip of the Kintyre peninsula, near Southend. However, being still in sight of his native land he moved further north along the west coast of Scotland. He was granted land on the island of Iona off the Isle of Mull which became the centre of his evangelising mission to the Picts. However, there is a sense in which he did not leave his native people, as the Irish Gaels had been colonising the west coast of Scotland for some time.

The Scottish Catholic Church would continue to grow in the centuries that followed, and in the 11th century Saint Margaret of Scotland (Queen Consort of Malcolm III of Scotland) strengthened the church&#x27;s ties with the Holy See, as did successive monarchs such as Margaret&#x27;s son, David, who invited several religious orders to establish monasteries.

===Reformation===
The Scottish Reformation was formalised in 1560, when the Church of Scotland broke with the Church of Rome during a process of Protestant reform led, among others, by John Knox. It reformed its doctrines and government, drawing on the principles of John Calvin which Knox had been exposed to while living in Switzerland. In 1560, the Scottish Parliament abolished papal jurisdiction and approved Calvin&#x27;s Confession of Faith, but did not accept many of the principles laid out in Knox&#x27;s &quot;First Book of Discipline&quot;, which argued, among other things, that all of the assets of the old church should pass to the new. The 1560 Reformation Settlement was not ratified by the crown for some years, and the question of church government also remained largely unresolved. In 1572 the acts of 1560 were finally approved by the young James VI, but under pressure from many of the nobles the Concordat of Leith also allowed the crown to appoint bishops with the church&#x27;s approval. John Knox himself had no clear views on the office of bishop, preferring to see them renamed as &quot;superintendents&quot;; but in response to the new Concordat a Presbyterian party emerged headed by Andrew Melville, the author of the &quot;Second Book of Discipline&quot;.

The Scottish Episcopal Church began as a distinct church in 1582, when the Church of Scotland rejected episcopal government (by bishops) and adopted a presbyterian government by elders as well as reformed theology. Scottish monarchs made repeated efforts to introduce bishops and two ecclesiastical traditions competed.

===Episcopal government imposed by the Stuarts===

In 1584, James VI of Scotland had the Parliament of Scotland pass the &quot;Black Acts&quot;, appointing two bishops and administering the Church of Scotland under direct royal control. This met vigorous opposition and he was forced to concede that the General Assembly should continue to run the church. Calvinists who disliked the more ceremonious style of liturgy were opposed by an Episcopalian faction. After ascending to the English throne in 1603 James stopped the General Assembly from meeting, increased the number of Scottish bishops and in 1618 held a General Assembly in Perth; this gathering adopted &quot;Five Articles&quot; of Episcopalian practices. Many Scottish church leaders, and their congregations, responded to the Five Articles with boycotts and disdain.

James&#x27;s son Charles I was crowned in Holyrood Abbey, Edinburgh, in 1633 with full Anglican rites. Subsequently, in 1637, Charles attempted to introduce a Scottish version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, written by a group of Scottish prelates, most notably the Archbishop of St Andrews, John Spottiswoode, and the Bishop of Ross, John Maxwell, and edited for printing by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud; it was a combination of Knox&#x27;s &quot;Book of Common Order&quot;, which was in use before 1637, and English liturgy in hopes of further unifying the (Anglican) Church of England and the (Presbyterian) Church of Scotland. When the revised &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was used for the first time during worship on 23 July 1637 in St Giles&#x27; Edinburgh, it sparked a riot which was so representative of the strength of popular feeling in Scotland that it indirectly precipitated the Bishops&#x27; Wars and this successful challenge of royal authority helped encourage many unhappy Irish Catholics into partaking in the Irish Rebellion of 1641 and the already increasingly uncooperative English Parliament into likewise declaring war on the king in the English Civil War. As a result of the weakness of the king, Presbyterian Covenanters were able to become the de facto government in Scotland until disagreement between the Scottish and English Parliaments over how to run Britain in terms of both civil and religious governance after the king was defeated led to another war and Scotland&#x27;s conquest by the Covenanters&#x27; erstwhile allies the English Parliament&#x27;s New Model Army.

Following the Restoration of the monarch in 1660, the government of Charles II reimposed episcopacy, and required all clergymen to swear allegiance to the king and bishops and renounce the Covenants, or be prevented from preaching in church. Up to a third, at least 27%, of the ministry refused, mostly in the south-west of Scotland, and numerous ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles across the south of Scotland, often attracting thousands of worshippers. This was forcibly repressed by the government, in actions later dubbed The Killing Time. The conflict continued under King James VII of Scotland (also James II of England) until the Glorious Revolution led to his removal from power.

With the 1689 refusal of the Scottish bishops to swear allegiance to William of Orange whilst James VII lived and had not abdicated, the Presbyterian polity was finally re-established in the Church of Scotland. However, the Confession of Faith Ratification Act 1690 (April c. 7) allowed Episcopalian incumbents, upon taking the Oath of Allegiance, to retain their benefices, though excluding them from any share in the government of the Church of Scotland without a further declaration of Presbyterian principles. Many &quot;non-jurors&quot; also succeeded for a time in retaining the use of the parish churches.

The excluded Scottish bishops were slow to organise the Episcopalian remnant under a jurisdiction independent of the state, regarding the then arrangements as provisional, and looking forward to a reconstituted national Episcopal Church under a sovereign they regarded as legitimate (see Jacobitism). A few prelates, known as college bishops, were consecrated without sees, to preserve the succession rather than to exercise a defined authority. At length the hopelessness of the Stuart cause and the growth of congregations outside the establishment forced the bishops to dissociate canonical jurisdiction from royal prerogative and to reconstitute for themselves a territorial episcopate.

The Scottish &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; came into general use at start of the reign of William and Mary. The Scottish Communion Office, compiled by the non-jurors in accordance with primitive models, has had a varying co-ordinate authority, and the modifications of the English liturgy that would be adopted by the American Church were mainly determined by its influence.

Among the clergy of post-Revolution days the most eminent are Bishop John Sage, a well-known patristic scholar; Bishop Rattray, liturgiologist; John Skinner, of Longside, author of &quot;Tullochgorum&quot;; Bishop Gleig, editor of the 3rd edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;; Dean Ramsay, author of &quot;Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character&quot;; Bishop A. P. Forbes; G. H. Forbes, liturgiologist; and Bishop Charles Wordsworth. Bishop James Sharp, a former moderate Covenanter and Resolutioner, was appointed Archbishop of St Andrews and primate of Scotland in 1661. He was reviled by Covenanters, and his murder in 1679 led to an escalation of hostilities.

===From the Union of England and Scotland in 1707===
In 1707 Scotland and England were merged into a single Kingdom of Great Britain. The Scottish Episcopalians Act 1711 protected the Episcopal Church, which marked its virtual incorporation as a distinct society. However, matters were still complicated by a considerable, though declining, number of Episcopalian incumbents holding parish churches. Moreover, the Jacobitism of the non-jurors provoked a state policy of repression in 1715 and 1745, and fostered the growth of new Hanoverian congregations, using the English Prayer Book (served by clergy who had been ordained by a bishop but amenable to none), who qualified themselves under the 1711 act. This act was further modified in 1746 and 1748 to exclude clergy ordained in Scotland.

These causes reduced the Episcopalians, who in 1689 had been a large section of the population, to a minority, save in a few corners of the west and north-east of Scotland. Their official recognition of George III, on the death of Charles Edward Stuart in 1788, removed the chief bar to progress. In 1792 the penal laws were repealed, but clerical disabilities were only finally removed in 1864. The Qualified Chapels were gradually absorbed in the early 19th century.

After the independence of the Thirteen Colonies, the Scottish Episcopal Church also took the step of consecrating Samuel Seabury at Aberdeen in 1784. He became the first bishop of the American Episcopal Church after being refused consecration by Church of England clergy. In this way, it can be said that the Episcopal Church in the United States owes as much of its origins to the Scottish Episcopal Church as to the Church of England.

The Theological College was founded in 1810, incorporated with Trinity College, Glenalmond, in 1848, and re-established at Edinburgh in 1876. Theological training is now provided by the various dioceses and is supervised by Scottish Episcopal Institute (formerly, the Theological Institute of the Scottish Episcopal Church).

In 1900 the church had 356 congregations, with a total membership of 124,335 and 324 working clergy. Membership did not grow in the following decades as it was believed it would.

In 1989 there were approximately 200 stipendiary and 80 non-stipendiary clergy. Membership was 65,000, with 31,000 communicants.

In 1995, the Scottish Episcopal Church began working through a process known as &quot;Mission 21&quot;. Canon Alice Mann of the Alban Institute was invited to begin developing a missionary emphasis within the congregations of the church throughout Scotland. This led to the development of the &quot;Making Your Church More Inviting&quot; programme which has now been completed by many congregations. In addition to working on making churches more inviting, &quot;Mission 21&quot; emphasises reaching out to new populations which have previously not been contacted by the church. As &quot;Mission 21&quot; has developed, changing patterns of ministry have become part of its remit.

In 1633 Charles I remodelled Holyrood Abbey as a Chapel Royal, and held his coronation there with full Episcopalian rites. In this year he also founded the See of Edinburgh and appointed William Forbes as first Bishop of Edinburgh in the following year. He also appointed John Guthrie, Bishop of Moray as the first, and last, Episcopalian Royal Almoner of Scotland. The Abbey was lost to its protestant congregation as part of the events of the Glorious Revolution and eventually ruined. The Lord Bishop of Edinburgh and Anglican congregation were also evicted from St Giles&#x27; Cathedral following the Prayer Book riots in 1637. The office of Royal Almoner was made largely honorific then effectively secular, and by 1835 had merged into the responsibilities of the King&#x27;s and Lord Treasurer&#x27;s Remembrancer. The current headquarters (the Scottish Episcopal Church General Synod Office) of the Scottish Episcopal Church is Forbes House, number 21 Grosvenor Crescent in the West End of Edinburgh.

The primus does not have any metropolitan jurisdiction. Metropolitan responsibilities are held by the diocesan bishops. The last head of the Scottish Episcopal Church to hold both primate and metropolitan titles was Arthur Rose, Archbishop of St Andrews, up to his death in 1704. The last bishop to exercise metropolitan authority was Alexander Rose, Bishop of Edinburgh, up to his death in 1720.

===21st century===
In terms of official membership, Episcopalians constitute well under 1 per cent of the population of Scotland, making them considerably smaller than the Church of Scotland. In 2012 the church had 310 parishes with an adult membership of 34,916 and communicant numbers some 10,000 fewer at 24,650. As with other churches in Scotland, attendance has declined over recent years: the overall figures reflect rises in some dioceses and decline in others, but amount to an overall fall in attendance of 15 per cent between 2007 and 2012. The church&#x27;s 2016 annual report noted a &quot;continuing decline in overall numbers&quot;, and in almost identical language it was reported in 2018 that the church faced &quot;continuing decline in members and attendance&quot;. By the end of 2020 numbers had fallen further to 27,600 (membership) and 19,800 (communicants). No meaningful attendance figures could be produced due to the legal restrictions on church attendance introduced in response to Covid-19.
By 2021 membership had fallen by a further 32% from 2012 levels, to just over 24000.

At the close of 2022, the denomination had 278 congregations. The statistics for the denomination, by their dioceses were as follows:

In recent decades, the Scottish Episcopal Church has taken a left-of-centre stand on various political issues including economic justice, the ordination of women and &quot;inclusion&quot;. A church canon was altered to allow same-sex marriage after it was formally approved by the General Synod in June 2017, despite the protests of some, including the representatives of the conservative Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney.

Following the vote, a number of individual congregations have begun to leave the church, although they have been obliged to leave their buildings and funds behind them. In November 2017 a high-profile female supporter of same-sex marriage, Anne Dyer was appointed Bishop of the theologically traditionalist Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney by the other bishops, rather than elected as usual. This drew protests, which the primus attacked as &quot;subversion&quot;, and Dyer was consecrated in March 2018. A number of clergy subsequently resigned, and in January 2019 the Westhill Community Church in Aberdeen voted to leave the SEC.

The Scottish Episcopal Institute, a theological college for the whole of the Scottish Episcopal Church, was founded in 2015. It provides training for both lay ministers and ordained clergy.

==Structure==

===Bishops and Primus===
As an episcopal denomination, the church is governed by bishops, differentiating it from the national Church of Scotland which is presbyterian and governed by elders. However, unlike the Church of England, the bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church are elected in a procedure involving clergy and laity of the vacant diocese voting at an electoral synod.

The church is composed of seven dioceses, each with its own bishop:

All sees except Edinburgh (founded by Charles I) stem from sees of the Catholic Church in Scotland. The bishops of the Episcopal Church are direct successors of the prelates consecrated to Scottish sees at the Restoration. The bishops are addressed &quot;Right Reverend&quot;.

The College of Bishops constitutes the episcopal synod, the supreme court of appeal.

This synod elects from among its own members a presiding Bishop who has the title of Primus (the title originates from the Latin phrase &quot;Primus inter pares&quot;&#x27;First among equals&#x27;).

The Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, the presiding bishop of the Scottish Episcopal Church, is elected by the episcopal synod from among its members. His duties are:
* to preside at all Provincial Liturgical Functions
* to preside at all meetings of the General Synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church
* to preside at all meetings of the Episcopal Synod
* to declare and carry out the resolutions of the General Synod, the Episcopal Synod and the College of Bishops
* to represent the Scottish Episcopal Church in its relation to all other Churches of the Anglican Communion and other Communions
* to perform the functions and duties of Primus as specified in the Canons of the Scottish Episcopal Church
* to correspond on behalf of the Scottish Episcopal Church with Primates, Metropolitans and the Secretary General of the Anglican Consultative Council.

The incumbent is Mark Strange, who was elected on 27 June 2017.

The Primus does not have any metropolitan jurisdiction—the last to hold such jurisdiction was Archbishop Arthur Rose (of St Andrews) up to his death in 1704. The Primus is addressed &quot;Most Reverend&quot;.

===Representative bodies===
The church is governed by the General Synod. This consists of the House of Bishops, the House of Clergy and the House of Laity. The General Synod makes canon law, administers finance and monitors the work of the boards and committees of the Church. Most decisions are arrived at by a simple majority of members of the General Synod voting together. More complex legislation, such as changes to the Code of Canons requires each of the Houses to agree and to vote in favour by a two-thirds majority.

Each diocese has its synod of the clergy and laity. Its dean (similar to an archdeacon in the Church of England) is appointed by the bishop, and, on the voidance of the see, summons the diocesan synod, at the instance of the primus, to choose a bishop. Each diocese has one or more (in the case of some united dioceses) cathedrals. The senior priest of a Scottish Episcopal cathedral is styled as provost (as the title of &quot;dean&quot; is given to the senior priest of the diocese as a whole, see above). The only exception in Scotland is the Cathedral of the Isles on the island of Great Cumbrae which has been led by a member of the clergy styled as Precentor. Diocesan deans and cathedral provosts are both addressed as &quot;Very Reverend&quot;.

==Worship and liturgy==
The Scottish Episcopal Church is mainly in the High Church (or Anglo-Catholic) tradition.

It embraces three orders of ministry: deacon, priest (referred to in the &quot;Scottish Prayer Book&quot; as presbyter) and bishop. Increasingly, an emphasis is being placed on these orders to work collaboratively within the wider ministry of the whole people of God.

===Liturgies===

In addition to the &quot;Scottish Prayer Book&quot; of 1929, the church has a number of other liturgies available to it. In recent years, revised Funeral Rites have appeared, along with liturgies for Christian Initiation (e.g. Baptism and Affirmation) and Marriage. The modern Eucharistic rite (Scottish Liturgy 1982) includes Eucharistic prayers for the various seasons in the Liturgical Year and is commonly known as &quot;The Blue Book&quot;, a reference to the colour of its covers. A further Eucharistic prayer is provided in the Marriage liturgy.

==Doctrine and practice==

This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a sixteenth-century apologist. In Hooker&#x27;s model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.

===Social issues===
The Scottish Episcopal Church has been involved in Scottish politics.

The church was one of the parties involved in the Scottish Constitutional Convention, which laid the groundwork for the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament in 1999. Canon Kenyon Wright of the Episcopal Church chaired the convention (1989–1999).

The church actively supports the work of the Scottish Churches Parliamentary Office in Edinburgh and the Society, Religion and Technology Project.

All orders of ministry are open to both male and female candidates. On 9 November 2017, the first woman, Anne Dyer, was elected bishop in the Episcopal Church in Scotland. She was consecrated as Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney in March 2018.

In the area of human sexuality, a debate continued for many years as to the propriety of fully permitting the presence of non-celibate lesbian and gay church members (there never having been a prohibition on membership or ordination of celibate homosexuals). In 2000, a former primate called for the church to bless same-sex couples. Clergy became able to enter into a same-sex civil partnership in 2005, and the church does not require sexual abstinence of such civil unions. Since 2008, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Glasgow has offered blessings for civil partnerships. In 2015 the General Synod passed a vote which led to the first stage of approval formal blessings of same-sex marriage. A number of congregations have hosted the blessings of same-sex couples including St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Glasgow and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Dundee.

In 2016, the General Synod voted in favour of changing the canon of marriage to include same-sex couples. The change was formally approved by the church in June 2017. As a result, at the Anglican Communion primates&#x27; meeting in October 2017 the Scottish Episcopal Church was suspended for three years from communion &quot;decision making on any issues of doctrine or polity&quot;, a mirror of the sanction applied to the U.S. Episcopal Church in 2016 for the same reason.

===Ecumenical relations===
Like many other Anglican churches, the Scottish Episcopal Church has entered into full communion with the Old Catholics of the Union of Utrecht. The Scottish Episcopal Church is also a member of the Porvoo Communion and is a member of several ecumenical bodies, including Action of Churches Together in Scotland and the World Council of Churches.

In December 2009, there were reports that certain High Church traditionalists within the Scottish Episcopal Church were in favour of joining the Roman Catholic Church.

==Relation with the Anglican realignment==
Conservative members have organised in the Scottish Anglican Network and are associated with the GAFCON. The Scottish Anglican Network announced on 8 June 2017, the same day that the SEC voted to approve same-sex marriage, that they would be in &quot;impaired communion&quot; with the denomination, due to this decision. The General Synod of the Anglican Church of Australia passed a motion on 7 September 2017, condemning SEC&#x27;s decision to approve same-sex marriage as &quot;contrary to the doctrine of our church and the teaching of Christ&quot;, and declaring itself in &quot;impaired communion&quot; with the province. It also expressed their &quot;support for those Anglicans who have left or will need to leave the Scottish Episcopal Church because of its redefinition of marriage and those who struggle and remain&quot;, and presented their prayers for the return of SEC &quot;to the doctrine of Christ in this matter and that impaired relationships will be restored.&quot; The Global South Primates expressed their support for the Scottish Anglican Network at their Communiqué from 9 September 2017.

To date nine churches have left the SEC since 2011, largely over the issue of the approval of same-sex marriage within the denomination. 5 joined Presbyterian churches and 4 GAFCON, through ACNA (list below):

* Christ Church, Harris (departed 2017)
* St Thomas&#x27;s, Corstorphine (departed 2018)
* Westhill Community Church (departed 2019)
* St Silas, Glasgow (departed 2019)

<text>John Glenn Columbus International Airport is an international airport located east of downtown Columbus, Ohio. Formerly known as Port Columbus International Airport, it is managed by the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, which also oversees operations at Rickenbacker International Airport and Bolton Field. The airport code &quot;CMH&quot; stands for &quot;Columbus Municipal Hangar,&quot; the original name of the airport.

John Glenn Columbus International Airport is primarily a passenger airport. It provides 148 non-stop flights to 31 airports via nine airlines daily.

On May 25, 2016, the Ohio General Assembly passed a bill to rename the airport from Port Columbus International Airport to its current name, in honor of astronaut and four-term U.S. senator John Glenn. The name change was unanimously approved by the airport&#x27;s nine-member board on May 24, 2016. Ohio Governor John Kasich signed the bill into law on June 14, 2016, with the name change becoming official 90 days later. On June 28, 2016, a celebration of the renaming was held and new signage bearing the airport&#x27;s new name was unveiled.

==History==
===Early history===

The airport opened July 8, 1929 as the Columbus Municipal Hangar on a site selected by Charles Lindbergh, as the eastern air terminus of the Transcontinental Air Transport air-rail New York to Los Angeles transcontinental route. Passengers traveled overnight on the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Airway Limited from New York to Columbus; by air from Columbus to Waynoka, Oklahoma; by rail again on the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe from Waynoka to Clovis, New Mexico; and by air from Clovis to Los Angeles. The original terminal building and hangars remain; the hangars are still in use, but the old terminal sits derelict.

During World War II, most of the facility was taken over by the U.S. Navy, which established Naval Air Station Columbus in 1942. NAS Columbus was closed and the facility relinquished back to civilian authorities in 1946. Also, during the war, the government established a government-owned aviation factory on the grounds of the airport known as Air Force Factory 85, eventually operated by North American Aviation. The plant produced the F-100 Super Sabre, RA-5 Vigilante, T-2 Buckeye, T-28 Trojan, OV-10 Bronco and T-39 Sabreliner.

The diagram on the February 1951 Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey instrument-approach chart shows runways 006/186 3550 ft long, 052/232 4400 ft, 096/276 4500 ft, and 127/307 5030 ft.

A new $12 million terminal building opened on September 21, 1958. Jet airline flights (American 707s) started in April 1964.
===Historical airline service===
The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 72 airline departures each weekday: 41 TWA, 16 American, 6 Eastern, 6 Lake Central and 3 Piedmont.

The first major airline to fly into Columbus was TWA, and it kept a presence at Columbus over 70 years during the era of airline regulation. TWA offered a club for exclusive passengers up until 2000 when America West took over a gate held by TWA and the club itself due to financial problems. The site of the club is now Eddie George‘s 27 grille.

Columbus was formerly a hub of America West Airlines, which it opened in 1993, but the company closed the hub in 2003 due to financial losses and the post-9/11-decline in air travel.

The airport was the home base of short-lived Skybus Airlines, which began operations from Columbus on May 22, 2007. The airline touted themselves as the cheapest airline in the United States, offering a minimum of ten seats for $10 each on every flight. Skybus ceased operations April 4, 2008.

In 1964 Jerrie Mock became the first woman to fly around the world. Flying solo in her Cessna 180 Skywagon named &quot;Spirit of Columbus&quot;, she took off from the Port Columbus airport on March 19, 1964, and arrived back 29 1/2 days later.

===Recent improvements===

A $70 million renovation of airport facilities, designed by Brubaker/Brandt, was initiated in 1979 for the airport&#x27;s 50th anniversary and completed in 1981. This upgraded the airport&#x27;s capacity to 250 flights per day by adding what is known today as Concourse B and added fully enclosed jetways at every gate. Ten years later in 1989, a second, $15.5 million, seven-gate south concourse (now Concourse A) was dedicated. The concourse was used exclusively by US Airways at the time, and later housed hubs for both America West Airlines until 2003, and Skybus Airlines until they shut it down in 2008 due to their bankruptcy. A north concourse was completed in 1996, which is now Concourse C, and was expanded in 2002.

Between 1998 and 2000, numerous airport expansion and renovation projects were completed, including a $25 million terminal renovation in 1998 that included additional retail shops, new flight information displays, enhanced lighting, upgraded flooring, and a new food court. Also, new hangars and office spaces were completed for NetJets in 1999, as well as a $92 million parking garage including an underground terminal entrance, new rental car facilities, dedicated ground transportation area, improved eight-lane terminal access on two levels, and a new atrium and entrances in 2000, which were designed by URS Corporation.

On April 25, 2004, a new control tower directed its first aircraft. This began several major facility enhancements to be constructed through 2025. On October 21, 2010, a new arrivals/departures board replaced the old one in the main entrance area.

Columbus began its Terminal Modernization Program in late 2012, which included new terrazzo flooring throughout the airport, new ceilings, new restrooms, more TSA security lanes, and new LED lighting. Construction started on Concourse A in late 2012 and was completed throughout the terminal in early 2016.

In 2013, the airport completed a $140 million runway improvement that moved the south runway farther from the north runway. This created a buffer distance that enables simultaneous takeoffs and landings on the north and south runways, increasing air traffic volume. Columbus mayor Michael B. Coleman commented, &quot;As the city grows, the airport needs to grow with it.&quot;

In 2019, construction began on a new car rental facility at the airport, with an estimated budget of $140 million. This facility moves car rental out of the parking garage, opening up more spaces for travelers. The new building opened in late 2021, and utilizes electric buses to transport passengers.

===Recent history===
Many airlines introduced new routes in the late 2010s, with the addition of Spirit Airlines with multiple destinations and Alaska Airlines with one daily flight to Seattle. Occasionally, larger aircraft that the airport is not used to receiving on a regular basis, such as the Boeing 767 and 777, are chartered through John Glenn and serviced by Lane Aviation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many new, current, and to-be-expanded routes were canceled or reduced. Air Canada temporarily suspended service to Columbus, while airlines such as United, American, and Delta used smaller aircraft for some of their mainline routes. Many of these routes saw an increase of service in mid-2021 as restrictions lifted and demand for air travel grew.

Startup Breeze Airways also selected Columbus as one of its launch destinations in July 2021 with five routes. The airline added additional routes from the airport in May 2023. Sun Country Airlines announced a plan to fly to the airport during the 2023 summer season.

Plans have been in development for many years for a new terminal, set to begin construction in 2025 to replace the current, aging building, beginning with the new car rental facility completed in 2021. 

In spring 2023, the airport prepared for a record travel summer matching traffic levels from before the COVID-19 pandemic.

In late 2024, ground was broken on a new terminal building slated for a 2029 completion, and will replace the current terminal once it opens.

==Facilities==

===Terminal===

==== Commercial terminal ====
John Glenn Columbus International Airport has one terminal with three concourses, and a total of 29 usable gates. The three concourses each have their own TSA security checkpoint, and are not connected airside (post-security). Non-precleared international flights arrive through Concourse C and are processed in the airport&#x27;s customs facility.

*Concourse A contains 7 gates, and is used primarily by Southwest Airlines.
*Concourse B contains 16 gates, and is used primarily by American Airlines, Air Canada, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines.
*Concourse C contains 11 gates, and is used primarily by Alaska Airlines, Breeze Airways, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and Viva.

==== General aviation terminals ====
The airport has two fixed-base operators, which offer fuel (both avgas and jet fuel), aircraft parking, conference rooms, crew lounges, snooze rooms, showers, courtesy transportation, and more.

===Ground transportation===
The airport is accessible directly by taking exit number nine on Interstate 670 to International Gateway. Alternatively, drivers can also get to the airport from the east via Hamilton Road, just south of Interstate 270, and enter at Sawyer Road or from the west via Stelzer Road.

Connected to the terminal is a six-story parking garage that provides long-term and short-term parking. Lower cost satellite parking options, with continuous free shuttle service, can be found in the Blue, Red and Green parking lots along International Gateway. The Blue lot is the closest to the terminal and also offers some covered parking. The cost of parking a car in the blue lot is $9 per 24 hours. The Red Lot costs $7 per 24 hours and the green lost costs $5 per 24 hours to park. The Green lot is the furthest away from the terminal. Additionally, there is a free cell phone lot accessed from the outbound side of International Gateway.

The Columbus Metropolitan Area&#x27;s bus service, the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), has a bus service between the airport and downtown Columbus. COTA&#x27;s 7 Mt. Vernon route is operated from downtown, with every other bus serving either the airport or Easton Transit Center.

The GoBus Rural Inter-City Bus Service operates a thrice daily schedule to Athens, via Lancaster, Logan, and Nelsonville.

Inbound taxi services operate through numerous taxi businesses in the Columbus area. A number of taxi services provide outbound transportation in the taxi lane.

===Other facilities===
In 2001, Executive Jet Aviation (now known as NetJets), opened up a operational headquarters.

In November 2006, Skybus Airlines began leasing of office and hangar facilities at the Columbus International AirCenter adjacent to the airport.

Regional carrier Republic Airways operates a large crew and maintenance base at the airport.

The airport has its own police and fire departments (ARFF-C).

==Accidents and incidents==
* On May 16, 1948, a Slick Airways Curtiss C-46 Commando crashed near CMH because of failure of the rudder and the failure of the fuselage carry-in structure beneath the vertical fin because of extreme turbulence. Both occupants were killed.
* On June 27, 1954, an American Airlines Convair CV-240 (N94263) from Dayton International Airport was on approach to Runway 27 at when the left side of the plane collided with a US Navy Beechcraft SNB-2C Navigator (BuA23773), also on approach. The Convair recovered and landed, though the nose gear collapsed on landing. The Beechcraft crashed short of the runway, killing two on board. The probable cause was attributed to a &quot;traffic control situation created by the tower local controller which he allowed to continue without taking the necessary corrective action. A contributing factor was the failure of both crews to detect this situation by visual and/or aural vigilance.&quot;
*On January 7, 1994, United Express Flight 6291, a BAe Jetstream 41 being operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines, was on approach to runway 28L when it entered into a stall at above runway level. The aircraft collided with a stand of trees and came to rest inside a commercial building short of the runway and burst into flames. The accident killed all three crewmembers and two of five passengers. The probable cause was attributed to &quot;(1) An aerodynamic stall that occurred when the flight crew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a very poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline; (2) Improper pilot response to the stall warning, including failure to advance the power levers to maximum, and inappropriately raising the flaps; (3) Flight crew experience in &#x27;glass cockpit&#x27; automated aircraft, aircraft type and in seat position, a situation exacerbated by a side letter of agreement between the company and its pilots; and (4) the company&#x27;s failure to provide adequate stabilized approach criteria, and the FAA&#x27;s failure to require such criteria. Member Vogt concluded that the last factor was contributory but not causal to the accident. Additionally, for the following two factors, Chairman Hall and Member Lauber concluded that they were causal to the accident, while Members Vogt and Hammerschmidt concluded they were contributory to the accident: (5) The company&#x27;s failure to provide adequate crew resource management training, and the FAA&#x27;s failure to require such training; and (6) the unavailability of suitable training simulators that precluded fully effective flight crew training.&quot;
*On April 23, 1998, a Beech 58 was destroyed and consumed by fire after it collided with terrain during approach to the CMH airport. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the pilot&#x27;s inadequate planned approach and his failure to follow wake turbulence avoidance procedures by not staying above the glide-path of the preceding Boeing 757, which resulted in a vortex turbulence encounter.
*On February 16, 1999, America West Airlines Flight 2811, an Airbus A320 (N628NW) was a flight to Newark to Columbus. While midair, the nose gear was turned 90 degrees the wrong way. No one was injured in the aircraft. This incident was also similar to Flight 292 in 2005.
*On September 26, 2005, a Cessna 560XL Citation Excel sustained substantial damage when the nose landing gear collapsed during taxi for takeoff at CMH. The cause for the collapse could not be determined.
*On October 7, 2007, a Cessna 210C Centurion sustained substantial damage during a gear-up landing following a loss of hydraulic system fluid. The pilot stated that the landing gear did not extend when he attempted to lower it during landing approach. The pilot then used the &quot;emergency pump system&quot; and noticed that only the main landing gear partially extended. The flaps did not extend. The pilot subsequently reported performing a gear-up landing. The probable cause of the accident was found to be a hydraulic system pump leak, which resulted in the failure of the emergency landing gear system to extend and lock the landing gear for landing and the flap system.
*On December 13, 2010, a Piaggio P180&#x27;s flight controls became bound during approach to the airport. During descent, the pilots noted that the yaw damper disengaged while the autopilot remained on, and the captain instructed the first officer, who was the pilot flying at the time, to check the freedom of the flight controls; all appeared to be &quot;frozen&quot; in place. The flightcrew exerted enough pressure until the controls broke free with a snap, but even after, the controls remained stiff and sticky for the remainder of the flight. The crew completed a normal approach and landing into CMH. A post flight inspection by maintenance personnel revealed ice in the fuselage belly area of frame 36 and around the primary flight control cables and pulleys in that area. The probable cause of the incident was found to be the failure of water to properly drain through the fuselage drain holes, thus becoming trapped and freezing around the flight control cables, which resulted in the loss of control authority to the airplane&#x27;s ailerons, elevator, and rudder.
*On August 26, 2012, an EVEKTOR-AEROTECHNIK As Sportstar experienced a brake failure on departure from Columbus. The pilot attempted to correct the turn by applying right rudder pedal, but the airplane veered off onto the grass. The airplane then pivoted 180 degrees, came back onto the taxiway surface and came to rest. The composite fracture surface showed discoloration consistent with a previous crack to that area of the strut. The probable cause of the accident was found to be the failure of the right main landing gear strut due to a preexisting crack. 
*On April 23, 2023, an American Airlines Boeing 737 made an emergency landing at the airport after encountering a bird strike during takeoff from the airport.

<text>Knight of Shadows is a fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, published in November 1989. It is the ninth book in the Amber saga.

Merlin continues to attempt to solve the mysteries in his life, in particular understanding why Julia turned against him, how she got involved with Jurt, and the person who is raging against him.

After being trapped in a strange world peopled with ghosts induced by the Pattern, Merlin discovers that he is involved in a superpower quarrel between Amber&#x27;s Pattern and the Logrus of Chaos.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the novel a &quot;mega-yarn so hypercomplicated that Zelazny spends the first 50 pages here explaining--not always convincingly--who&#x27;s been doing what to whom, and why.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Readers who enjoyed the poetic writing, skilled plotting and crafted characterizations of the original Amber books will be disappointed again.&quot; Drew Bittner of the &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot; wrote: &quot;With his customary excellent imagery and strong characterization, especially the running dialogue between Merlin and his magical strangling cord, Zelazny&#x27;s newest work is a worthy addition to the Amber series, adding a few more clues to the mysteries of Amber.&quot;

<text>Ilocos Norte (), officially the Province of Ilocos Norte (; ), is a province of the Philippines located in the Ilocos Region. It is located in the northwest corner of Luzon Island, bordering Cagayan and Apayao to the east, and Abra to the southeast, and Ilocos Sur to the southwest. Ilocos Norte faces the South China Sea to the west and the Luzon Strait to the north. Its capital is Laoag City, which is the most populous settlement in the province.

Ilocos Norte is noted for its distinctive geography and culture. This includes numerous examples of well-preserved Spanish colonial era architecture, particularly Saint William&#x27;s Cathedral in Laoag with its sinking bell tower constructed in the Earthquake Baroque style, the St. Augustine Church in Paoay which is one of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites in the Philippines, and the Cape Bojeador Lighthouse. Famous geographical features include the La Paz Sand Dunes, the beaches of Pagudpud, and the eroded calcarenite Kapurpurawan rock formation in Burgos. 

It is the birthplace of several notable Philippine leaders, including former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, Philippine Revolutionary War general Artemio Ricarte and Iglesia Filipina Independiente co-founder Gregorio Aglipay. 

Three wind farms are located in Ilocos Norte. They are located in Burgos, Pagudpud, and Bangui; with the latter being the first wind power generation plant in the Philippines.

==History==
=== Early history ===
Long before the arrival of the Spaniards, there existed an extensive region consisting of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra and La Union. Merchants from Japan and China often visited the area to trade gold for beads, ceramics, and silk. The Austronesian inhabitants of the region called their place &quot;samtoy&quot;, from &quot;sao mi toy&quot;, which literally meant &quot;our language&quot;.

=== Spanish colonial era ===
In 1571, the Spanish conquistadors had Manila under their control and they began looking for new sites to conquer. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi&#x27;s grandson Juan de Salcedo volunteered to lead one of these expeditions. Together with 8 armed boats and 45 men, the 22-year-old voyager headed north. On June 13, 1572, Salcedo and his men landed in present-day Vigan then proceeded to Laoag, Currimao, and Badoc. As they sailed along the coast, they were surprised to see numerous sheltered coves (&quot;looc&quot;) where the locals lived in harmony. They named the region &quot;Ylocos&quot; and its people &quot;Ylocanos&quot;.

As the Christianization of the region grew, so did the landscape of the area. Vast tracts of land were utilized for churches and bell towers in line with the Spanish mission of &quot;bajo las campanas&quot;. It was not uncommon to see garrisons around the town plaza and under the church bells. Indigenous peoples living in the Ilocos Region, such as the Yapayao and Isneg, were slowly pushed into living in the sparsely populated but resource-rich mountains, which would expose them to conflicts with developers in later eras, such as during Martial Law under Ferdinand Marcos.

Spanish colonization of the region was not completely successful. Owing to the abusive practices of many Augustinian friars, a number of Ilocanos revolted. Noteworthy of these were the Dingras Uprising (1589) and the Pedro Almasan Revolt (San Nicolas, 1660). In 1762, Diego Silang led a series of battles aimed at freeing the Ilocano. When he died from friendly fire, his widow Gabriela continued his cause. Later on, she, too, was captured and executed.

In 1807 the sugar cane (&quot;basi&quot;) brewers of Piddig rose up in arms to protest the government&#x27;s monopoly of the wine industry. In 1898, the church excommunicated Gregorio Aglipay for refusing to cut ties with the revolutionary forces of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Unperturbed, Aglipay nevertheless established the &quot;Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot;.

In an effort to gain political control and because of the increasing population of the region, a Royal Decree splitting Ilocos into two provinces - Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur - was signed on February 2, 1818. Soon thereafter, La Union and Abra became independent provinces.

=== Japanese occupation ===
After the fall of Corregidor and the subsequent occupation of the Philippines by the Empire of Japan, a number of small guerrilla groups formed in the area of Ilocos Norte. While some resorted to banditry, Governor Roque Ablan Sr. and Philippine Army Lt. Feliciano Madamba were able to put together a guerrilla unit to engage the Japanese forces and to rally the other guerrilla groups into a common force. The leaders were assigned specific sectors using a system for distributing news and orders.

=== Philippine independence ===

The decade after the recognition of Philippine independence marked a return of the tobacco industry to Ilocos Norte. Ever since the end of the tobacco monopoly, tobacco production had declined in the Ilocos as Filipinos started shifting from locally made cigars to foreign made cigarettes. But after reading a feature article series by Maximo Soliven which explained why Virginia tobacco would grow well on Ilocos soil, businessman Harry Stonehill was convinced to invest extensively in rebuilding the industry, establishing the Philippine Tobacco Flue-Curing and Redrying Corporation (PTFCRC) in 1951 and recruiting farmers from throughout Region 1 to produce tobacco. The following year, La Union Congressman Manuel T. Cases filed a bill to &quot;limit the importation of foreign leaf tobacco,&quot; which was eventually signed by President Elpidio Quirino as Republic Act 698. This allowed Stonehill&#x27;s investments to make a handsome profit, and the newly-rebuilt local industry to bloom. Stonehill was later deported a decade later, in the 1960s, for tax evasion and bribery of government officials, in what would later be called the Stonehill scandal, but the tobacco industry continued to grow.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
Ilocos Norte gained additional prominence in December 1965 when Ferdinand Marcos became president, and again when he won a second term in 1969, boosted by debt-driven infrastructure spending that created economic crises and massive social unrest at the beginning of the 1970s. Facing the end of his constitutionally allowed presidential terms, he declared martial law in 1972 and became dictator under a system of constitutional authoritarianism for fourteen more years. His family and cronies were accused of stealing an estimated US$5 billion to US$10 billion during the 1980s, when the Philippine economy sharply declined until Marcos was deposed by the civilian-led People Power Revolution of February 1986.

Various human rights violations were documented in the Ilocos Norte region during the Marcos martial law era, despite public perception that the region was supportive of Marcos&#x27; administration. Various farmers from the towns of Vintar, Dumalneg, Solsona, Marcos, and Piddig were documented to have been tortured, and eight farmers in Bangui and three indigenous community members in Vintar were &quot;salvaged&quot; in 1984.

There were also various protests against the Marcos administration at the time, with Aurora Park in the Laoag Plaza being one of the favored places to stage protests. One of the prominent victims of the Martial Law era who came from Laoag was Catholic layperson and social worker Purificacion Pedro, who volunteered in organizations protesting the Chico River Dam Project in the nearby Cordillera Central mountains. Wounded while visiting activist friends in Bataan, she was later killed by Marcos administration soldiers while recuperating in the hospital. Another prominent opponent of the martial law regime was human rights advocate and Bombo Radyo Laoag program host David Bueno, who worked with the Free Legal Assistance Group in Ilocos Norte during the later part of the Marcos administration and the early part of the succeeding Aquino administration. He would later be assassinated by motorcycle-riding men in fatigue uniforms on October 22, 1987 – part of a wave of assassinations that coincided with the 1986–87 coup d&#x27;état that tried to unseat the democratic government set up after the 1986 People Power Revolution. Both Bueno and Pedro were later honored among the first 65 people to have their names inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who fought the dictatorship, and Pedro was listed among Filipino Catholics nominated to be named Servant of God.

=== Contemporary ===
The municipality of Batac became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9407&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on June 23, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.

Ilocos Norte was among the provinces affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, reporting its first three cases of COVID-19 on March 31, 2020, including a male patient each from Batac and Paoay, and former senator Bongbong Marcos, who had arrived from travel to Spain. Ilocos Norte experienced surges in cases in 2021, with the spike reported in August 2021 being attributed to the Delta variant of the virus.

<text>Porno (later republished as T2 Trainspotting after the 2017 film adaptation) is a novel published in 2002 by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh, the sequel to &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. The book describes the characters of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; ten years after the events of the earlier book, as their paths cross again, this time with the pornography business as the backdrop rather than heroin use (although numerous drugs, particularly cocaine, are mentioned throughout). A number of characters from &quot;Glue&quot; make an appearance as well.

This sequel picks up ideas of the film adaptation of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. One example is the fact that &quot;Spud&quot; has received his share of the drug money, which is shown in the film, but only alluded to in the book.

==Plot summary==
===Section 1: Stag===
Simon &#x27;Sick Boy&#x27; Williamson leaves the London crack scene and returns to Leith when he comes into ownership of his aunt&#x27;s pub. Convinced that the area is destined to become a social and cultural hub, Simon decides to focus his energy into making the pub an upper class establishment. Nikki Fuller-Smith is a university student who works part-time in a massage parlour. Rab, a university acquaintance, introduces her to his friend Terry Lawson and his underground, home-made pornography operation. The scene interests Nikki.

Danny &#x27;Spud&#x27; Murphy has been regularly attending group sessions in an attempt to kick his drug habit. His relationship with his partner Alison is estranged and Spud feels like he has become a burden on her. He considers his life insurance policy and contemplates suicide.

Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, Mark Renton is co-owner of a successful nightclub. One night, a DJ from his hometown (Carl Ewart from Welsh&#x27;s previous novel &quot;Glue&quot;) plays at one of his clubs and recognises him.

When Sick Boy learns of Terry&#x27;s operation, he offers the use of the upstairs bar to shoot some scenes. During their first meeting, the group begins planning to shoot a full-length adult film. The first section concludes with &quot;OOTSIDE&quot;, a chapter noting the release into society of Francis Begbie.

===Section 2: Porno===
While in prison, Begbie received anonymous packages of gay porn sent from Sick Boy. He was determined to find the culprit upon his release. While accompanying an old friend on a debt collection errand, he meets Kate and begins a relationship with her.

When Alison begins working at Sick Boy&#x27;s pub and Sick Boy deliberately attempts to end her relationship with Spud, the friendship between Spud and Sick Boy is over. During one heated argument, Spud reveals that he received his share of the money from Renton. He also unveils his recent ambition to write a history of Leith.

Begbie visits Sick Boy&#x27;s pub. As the two converse, Sick Boy considers the merciless trait of opportunity and threat accompanying Begbie&#x27;s release. Soon after, Terry, Rab and several other friends arrive and begin discussing their upcoming road trip to Amsterdam, a bachelor celebration for Rab. Sick Boy is initially reluctant to attend but changes his mind after Carl, a DJ, mentions that Renton works at a club there.

===Section 3: Exhibition===
Sick Boy&#x27;s &quot;Porno&quot; shoot becomes a slow demolition of his so-called mates. Spud ends their friendship when Sick Boy tells him he was using him for the purpose of a scam, Nikki becomes disillusioned with him after realising that he really has no loving side and really is the cold-hearted, deceitful man that she tried desperately to ignore.

Begbie grows tired of Sick Boy being &#x27;smarmy&#x27;, although Begbie becomes angry with everyone in due course. Spud tries to provoke Begbie into killing him so his wife Alison will profit from his life insurance. As Begbie is angrily beating Spud, Alison and the couple&#x27;s young son burst in, stopping them. Spud is severely injured, but his last narration implies that he can see life getting better.

The biggest departure Sick Boy has from his life is Renton. After promising to meet Sick Boy in Cannes, Renton instead goes to Zürich to empty their joint account and then start a new life in San Francisco. This deception is the biggest blow to Sick Boy as he obviously treasured their unconventional friendship and cannot believe he was tricked by Renton again.

Begbie later discovers Renton while visiting Leith and is hit by a car while running across the road to assault him. While Renton would have expected to feel happy by this he is heartbroken and comforts Begbie while he is taken to hospital. It is indicated that as Begbie slips into a coma he may have forgiven Renton. After learning that Begbie has fallen into a coma, Renton flees the country with Nikki and Diane, as well as Sick Boy&#x27;s £60,000 made from a financial fraud. The book ends with Begbie suddenly coming awake as Sick Boy confesses everything in hope that Begbie will resume his bloodthirsty hunt for Renton.

==Style==
The novel is divided into three sections, each of which comprises chapters with different narrators. Unlike &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, which had more narrational diversity, &quot;Porno&quot; is reduced to just five narrators: Sick Boy, Renton, Spud, Begbie and Nikki. Another difference from the format of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; is that each character has a defined chapter heading depending on what chapter it is. For instance, Sick Boy&#x27;s chapters all begin with &quot;Scam...&quot; and then a number in front of a &quot;#&quot;. Renton&#x27;s all begin with &quot;Whores of Amsterdam Pt...&quot; Spud&#x27;s chapters are just narrative, Begbie&#x27;s are in capitals, and Nikki&#x27;s are quotes from the chapter, for example &quot;...A SIMON DAVID WILLIAMSON PRODUCTION...&quot;.

Each narrator is associated with a distinctive prose style. Renton, Sick Boy, and Nikki&#x27;s chapters are written almost entirely in &quot;standard&quot; English while Begbie and Spud&#x27;s chapters are in Scots. For example, in Chapter 25, Spud narrates, &quot;So ah&#x27;m downcast git intae the library, thinkin tae masel&quot; (&quot;So I&#x27;m downcast when I get into the library thinking to myself&quot;). He also repeats certain words when talking such as &quot;catboy&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;likes&quot; or &quot;likesay&quot;, and &quot;ken?&quot; Begbie often swears a lot during his chapters. Sick Boy&#x27;s returning grandiose nature is featured in imagined interviews with John Gibson of the &quot;Evening News&quot; and Alex McLeish.

==Main characters==
*Simon David &quot;Sick Boy&quot; Williamson - bitter by a string of failed business ventures, Sick Boy decides to make a porn film. A heavy cocaine user and still angry about being ripped off by Renton in the previous novel. In the years since &quot;Trainspotting&quot; he had a son with a woman who is now his ex-wife. He has also lost some of the charisma and good looks he previously possessed.
*Mark &quot;Rents&quot; Renton - kicked heroin and owns a successful nightclub in Amsterdam. He agrees to finance Sick Boy&#x27;s porn film in exchange for a share of the profits, despite a mutual lack of trust and respect. Has got into shape and learned martial arts in anticipation and fear of an eventual meeting with Begbie.
*Nikki Fuller-Smith - an English 25-year old university student and film studies major who moonlights performing minor sexual favours at a sauna/massage parlour. Experiences intermittent bulimic disordered eating and is attracted to Sick Boy. She decides to help Sick Boy with his film by starring in it.
*Terry Lawson - an arrogant lothario, his sexual exploits find him involved in the local dogging / amateur pornography scene, into which Rab introduces Nikki, becoming the star of Seven Rides.
*Rab Birrell - brother of Billy Birrell and a college mate of Nikki also on her Film Studies course - and fuels the idea of exploiting the girls from Terry&#x27;s pub, and Nikki&#x27;s knowledge of film and pornography. 
*Danny &quot;Spud&quot; Murphy - after receiving his share of the drug money he has been regularly attending group sessions in an attempt to kick his drug habit. Is in an estranged relationship with Alison (a character who was in an on / off relationship with Sick Boy in &quot;Trainspotting&quot;) and feels like he has become a burden on her. He considers his life insurance policy and contemplates suicide.
*Rab &quot;Second Prize&quot; McLaughlin - a recovering alcoholic, the fifth of the gang robbed by Renton at the end of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (though not in the film). Has turned to religion in an attempt to cure his alcoholism and distance himself from his former friends.
*Francis &quot;Franco&quot; Begbie – a dangerous psychopath who seeks out his former friends after being recently released from prison. He ends up murdering the sex offender Chizzie, effectively destroying the plans of all the characters, though he sees his own actions as heroic.

==Reception==
&quot;Porno&quot; was generally well-received among British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the novel an average rating of 8 out of 10 based on reviews from multiple British papers. &quot;The Herald&quot; assessed reviews as the &quot;critical thermometer&quot; of &quot;Cold and Hot&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s verdict reads: &quot;Politically incorrect but poetically just, the follow-up is as engrossing and gross as the original. Vicarious ventriloquism or empowering articulation, Welsh&#x27;s use of idiom is unsurpassed&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

Danny Boyle stated his wish to make a sequel to &quot;Trainspotting&quot; based on &quot;Porno&quot; which takes place nine years later. He was reportedly waiting until the original actors themselves age visibly enough to portray the same characters, ravaged by time; Boyle joked that the natural vanity of actors would make it a long wait.
On 10 September 2009, Robert Carlyle revealed that Boyle was &quot;edging closer&quot; to making &quot;Porno&quot;. Carlyle, who played Begbie in the film, said he would &quot;jump through hoops of fire backwards&quot; for the filmmaker and would &quot;do &quot;Porno&quot; tomorrow for nothing.&quot; Ewan McGregor, who played anti-hero Renton, expressed his reluctance to do a sequel saying it would be a &quot;terrible shame&quot;. Boyle and McGregor had not worked together since 1997&#x27;s &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot;, after which McGregor was passed over in favour of Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role in Boyle&#x27;s big screen adaptation of Alex Garland&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Beach&quot;. In 2013, McGregor noted that he was &quot;ready to work&quot; on the film with Boyle after reconciling.

In 2013 Boyle said that any sequel to &quot;Trainspotting&quot; would be loosely based on &quot;Porno&quot;. On 6 May 2014, Welsh confirmed that he had spent a week with Boyle, Andrew Macdonald and the creative team behind &quot;Trainspotting&quot; to discuss the sequel. Welsh stated that the meeting was in order to &quot;explore the story and script ideas. We&#x27;re not interested in doing something that will trash the legacy of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;... we want to do something that&#x27;s very fresh and contemporary.&quot;

On 17 November 2014, Welsh revealed that McGregor and Boyle had resolved their differences and had held meetings about the film, saying &quot;I know Danny and Ewan are back in touch with each other again. There are others in the cast who’ve had a rocky road, but now also reconciled. With the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; sequel the attention is going to be even more intense this time round because the first was such a great movie - and Danny’s such a colossus now. We’re all protective of the Trainspotting legacy and we want to make a film that adds to that legacy and doesn’t take away from it.&quot;

Filming on a sequel to &quot;Trainspotting&quot; began in May 2016, with all the major cast members reprising their roles and Danny Boyle directing. It was released on 27 January 2017.

A stage adaptation of Porno, written by Davie Carswell and following the novel more closely than the film, premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2022.

<text>Prince of Chaos is a fantasy novel by American writer Roger Zelazny, the final book in &quot;The Chronicles of Amber&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
Merlin finds himself summoned back to the land where he was raised, the Courts of Chaos. He finds himself enmeshed in political intrigues and schemes, and himself much closer to the crown than he believed possible, or wants. He encounters a variety of old acquaintances, and finds himself fighting with both his wits and his magic to avoid the snares laid for him, to help his friends, and to discover his father&#x27;s fate.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the novel &quot;Glum, talky, and threadbare.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote that it &quot;still fails to capture the spirit that rendered the five original Amber novels so enjoyable.&quot; John R. Alden of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called the novel the &quot;kind of book that gives fantasy a bad name&quot; and wrote that the writing &quot;is the literary equivalent of a magician&#x27;s chatter.&quot;

<text>Ilocos Sur (), officially the Province of Ilocos Sur (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Ilocos Region in Luzon. Located on the mouth of the Mestizo River is the capital of Vigan, while Candon is the most-populous city. Ilocos Sur is bordered by Ilocos Norte and Abra to the north, Mountain Province to the east, La Union and Benguet to the south and the West Philippine Sea to the west.

Ilocos Sur was established in 1818 when the province of Ilocos was split into two: the north (now Ilocos Norte) and the south (Ilocos Sur). At that time, it included parts of Abra and the upper half of present-day La Unión. The current boundaries of the province set in March 1917 by virtue of Act No. 2683.

The province is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, namely, the Heritage City of Vigan and the Santa Maria Basilica.

==History==

===Early history===
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the coastal plains in northwest Luzón from Bangui in the north to Namacpacan in the south were part of a region called the Ylokos. It lies between the West Philippine Sea in the west and the Northern Cordilleras in the east. On the western side, the land is sandy; while on the eastern side (near the mountains that separate the region from the Mountain Province) the land is rocky. This left a narrow strip of plains for cultivation. The mountains come so close to the sea that the highway is carved into them. The pressure of an increasing population and the need for land made the people thrifty, and they built their villages near small bays and coves called &quot;looc&quot; in the local dialect. These coastal inhabitants were known as &quot;Ylocos&quot;, which means &quot;from the lowlands&quot;. The region was then called by the ancient name Samtoy, from &quot;sao mi ditoy&quot; (&quot;our language&quot; in Ilocano).

===Spanish colonial era=== 
The Ilocos region was a thriving and fairly-advanced cluster of towns and settlements familiar to Chinese, Japanese, and Malay traders when the Spanish explorer Juan de Salcedo arrived in Vigan on June 13, 1572. The Spanish made Cabigbigaan their headquarters, which Salcedo called Villa Fernandina. It also became known as the &quot;Intramuros de Ilocandia&quot;. Salcedo declared all of Northern Luzón an &quot;encomienda&quot; (land grant). He was the &quot;encomendero&quot; of Vigan and lieutenant governor of Ylokos until his death in July 1574.

Augustinian missionaries evangelized the region, establishing parishes and building churches that still stand. Three centuries later, Vigan became the seat of the Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia.

The coast of Samtoy was known to the Spanish colonizers in 1572, when Juan de Salcedo traveled along it. Sent by Miguel López de Legazpi to explore the island of Luzón, Salcedo founded &quot;Ciudad Fernandina&quot; in 1574 in Bigan, in present-day Ilocos Sur. It became the center of Spanish rule and influence, including the evangelization and pacification movements. Due to Salcedo&#x27;s efforts, the settlements in Tagurín, Santa Lucía, Nalbacán, Bantay, Candón and Sinayt were pacified and paid tribute to the King of Spain.

====Conversions====
According to the Spanish chronicler Pigafetta, &quot;The Ilocos are all Christians and are the humblest and most tractable&quot;. The Augustinians established parishes in Santa in 1576, Tagurín in 1586, Santa Lucía in 1586, Nalbacán in 1587, Candón in 1591, and Bantay in 1590. They built a church in Bigan in 1641 which later became the Cathedral of the Episcopal See of Nueva Segovia after 117 years.

====Partition of Ylokos====
Ylokos consisted of the present-day provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra and part of Mountain Province. A royal decree of February 2, 1818 separated Ilocos Norte from Ilocos Sur, the latter including northern La Union (as far as Namacpacan, present-day Luna) and present-day Abra. The sub-provinces of Lepanto and Amburayan in Mountain Province were annexed by Ilocos Sur.

The passage of Act No. 2683 by the Philippine Legislature in March 1917 defined the province&#x27;s current geographical boundaries.

====Vigan====
Vigan, almost four centuries old, was once known as Kabigbigaan (from biga, a coarse, erect plant with large, ornate leaves that grows on riverbanks). Bigan was later changed to Vigan. To the Spanish it was Villa Fernandina, in honor of King Ferdinand.

Vigan was founded in 1574 by Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo as the capital of Ylocos. The town, with a population of 8,000 (greater than that of Manila at the time), was the center of Ilocano civilization before Salcedo&#x27;s arrival. It was somewhat prosperous, trading with the Chinese and Japanese who brought jars, silk and crockery through the nearby port of Pandan, Caoayan.

In the 19th century, Vigan traded with Europe. Ships loaded with indigo delivered their goods to textile mills. The invention of chemical dyes in Germany eliminated this industry. Affluent citizens of Vigan stocked their homes with statuettes of brass and iron, dinnerware, and other artifacts of European civilization, including fine ivory, inlaid furniture, and Chinese wares.

====Social institutions====
Salcedo bequeathed his &quot;encomienda&quot; to a select group who continued the tenancy system which developed into the practice of caciquism, landlordism and usury. The &quot;kaillanes&quot; revolted against the aristocracy in 1762. Vigan&#x27;s two sections during the mid-19th-century indigo boom—one for the &quot;meztizo&quot;s and the other for the &quot;naturales&quot;—remain distinct.

====Migration====
Spanish colonizers used free labor in the development of Ilocos Sur. Resentment of free labor triggered sporadic revolts, and those who refused to be slaves or tenants left the region for Abra and the Cagayan Valley. From 1898 to the first decade of the 20th century, covered oxcarts moved to the rich plains of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac. Children were told tales of Lam-ang, Angalo, Aran, Juan Sadot and other legendary Ilocano characters. Folk songs such as &quot;Pamulinawen&quot;, &quot;Manang Biday&quot;, and &quot;Dungdungwen Kanto Unay, Unay&quot; became popular.

During the second phase of Ilocano migration, from 1908 to 1946, surplus labor migrated to the plantations of Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. Ilocos Sur&#x27;s population density was 492 per square mile at the height of migration, which made it the most densely-populated region in the Philippines except for Manila. The last group of labor migrants to Hawaii was in 1946, when 7,365 men were recruited by the United States Department of Labor. Vigan was the recruiting center. More than eighty percent of Filipinos in Hawaii are of Ilocano origin.

====Economic prosperity====
The first half of the 19th century was an economic boom for Ilocos Sur. During this period, the cotton, tobacco and indigo industries were encouraged by the government. With the operations of the Royal Company of the Philippines (), the textile industry was developed on a large scale and the abolition of the tobacco monopoly accelerated economic progress.

====Revolts====
The beginning of Spanish rule to the first decade of the nineteenth century was characterized by revolts against tribute, forced labor and monopolies. The Ilocos revolt (1762–1763), better known as Silang&#x27;s Revolt, was aimed at the &quot;babaknangs&quot; and the &quot;alcalde-mayor&quot; of Vigan. After Diego Silang&#x27;s assassination on May 28, 1763, his wife Maria Josefa Gabriela continued the fight until she was captured and hanged on September 20, 1763. A revolt against the government monopoly of &quot;basi&quot;, the native wine, began on September 16, 1807. Regular troops and recruits defeated the rebels.

On March 25, 1898, Isabelo Abaya began an uprising in Candón and raised a red flag in the town plaza as a response to Spanish abuses and oppression. A revolutionary government was established, and several other revolts followed. The Spanish sent shock troops to re-occupy Candon, and most of the leaders and participants in the uprising who surrendered were arrested and executed.

====Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War====

Ilocos Sur, like other Philippine provinces, rallied behind Emilio Aguinaldo in the 1896 Philippine Revolution. When Vigan was captured, the rebels made Bishop&#x27;s Palace their headquarters. On March 21, 1898, Mariano Acosta of Candón established a provincial revolutionary government. When General Aguinaldo returned from exile in Hong Kong, he sent Manuel Tinio to wage guerilla warfare on the Americans. Vigan was Tinio&#x27;s headquarters until it was occupied by the U.S. 45th Infantry Division under James Parker on December 4, 1899. Gregorio del Pilar died on December 2, 1899, in the Battle of Tirad Pass.

===American invasion===
Under the Americans, a civil government was established in Ilocos Sur on September 1, 1901. Mena Crisólogo, a delegate to the Malolos Congress, was the first provincial governor.

===Japanese occupation===
On December 10, 1941, a contingent of Japanese Imperial forces landed in Mindoro, Vigan, Santa, Pandan and Caoayan. In Cervantes, the Battle of Bessang Pass was fought between Tomoyuki Yamashita&#x27;s forces and the U.S. 21st Infantry; it was the greatest victory by Filipino guerrillas over the Japanese Imperial Army in World War II. The guerrillas mounted a series of attacks that lasted for almost six months in early 1945.

===Marcos era===
Much of the history of Ilocos Sur during the 21 years of the Marcos dictatorship are not well-documented, with the most prominent portrayals of Ilocos Sur history preferring to skip from the years immediately after Philippine independence in the 1940s, jumping straight to contemporary times. 

In Ilocos Sur, the most prominent protests and incidents of the Marcos era - such as the infamous &quot;Bantay incident: and the assassination of Reoresentative Floro Crisologo - actually took place before the declaaration of Martial Law in 1972, and involved the Marcos administration&#x27;s support for local strongmen rather than national controversies.

Organizations such as the Federation of Free Farmers (FFF) and Federation of Free Workers (FFW), sometimes supported by progressive elements of the Catholic Church, continued to fight for the labor rights of the poor until the 1972 declaration of Martial law made it illegal to peaceful protests. 

Some of the frustrated protesters then opted to pursue an armed resistance against the dictatorship, many of whom only returned to peaceful life after the Marcoses were finally deposed by the civilian-led People Power revolution of 1986.

There were numerous human rights violations documented in Ilocos Sur in connection to the Marcos martial law era, and there was at least one camp in the province that held political Prisoners during the Marcos era - a &quot;Camp Diego Silang&quot;, which is different from the Police Camp established in La Union in 1989. 

==== Bantay incident ====
Marcos&#x27; victory in the 1965 Presidential Elections had required that he gain political control of the north as a solid voting block, which meant forming alliances with the most prominent local &quot;warlords&quot; of the time - Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative Antonio Raquiza whom Marcos would later appoint as Secretary of Public Works and Highways; La Union 2nd District Representative Manuel T. Cases; and Ilocos Sur 1st District Representative Floro Singson Crisologo. Crisologo&#x27;s cousin, Captain Fabian Ver of the Philippine Constabulary&#x27;s Criminal Investigation Service, became part of Marcos&#x27; inner circle and eventually became one of Marcos&#x27; most trusted lieutenants. Historian Alfred McCoy noted in a 2017 article that &quot;The Crisologos were one of the political families that was buoyed by the rise of Marcos to power, and that they were able to dominate their political rivals in Ilocos Sur as Marcos solidified his hold on power. McCoy also noted that Crisologo created a private army, which residents called the &quot;saka-saka&quot;, which literally means &quot;barefooted&quot; in Ilocano; controlled electoral offices; and used blockades to create a monopoly on the tobacco that came out of the province.

But a turning point took place in May 1970 with the so-called &quot;Bantay Incident&quot;. The &quot;saka-saka&quot; assassinated a former mayor of Bantay, the town next to Vigan, in 1969, and then in May 1970, burned the villages of Ora Este and Ora Centro in retaliation for their residents&#x27; support for Crisologo&#x27;s opponent Chavit Singson during the 1996 elections. One elderly woman who was killed in the blaze. Public opinion compelled Marcos to investigate the incident and arrest Crisologo&#x27;s son Vincent, who was reported to be the leader the &quot;saka-saka&quot; at the time. McCoy notes that Crisologo reportedly went to Marcos and appealed for help, while demanding a greater share of rewards that Marcos had promised him in exchange for supporting his presidential reelection campaign in 1969. When Marcos refused, Crisologo reportedly then threatened to expose Marcos&#x27;s and Ver&#x27;s participation in cornering the tobacco monopoly in the Ilocos Region.

==== Assassination of Floro Crisologo ====

Shortly after his reported meeting with Marcos, Crisologo was killed on 18 October 1970 after being shot in the head while kneeling inside Vigan Cathedral during a church service, by a gunman who stood directly behind him and then escaped among terrified churchgoers. His killer was never found and the case remains unsolved. 

No special election was called to replace him in Congress, and his seat remained vacant until the dissolution of Congress in 1972 following the declaration of martial law by President Marcos in 1972 and was only occupied again in 1987 following Marcos&#x27;s overthrow and the restoration of Congress. Crisologo&#x27;s murder and the defeat of his wife Carmeling to Chavit Singson in the gubernatorial race and that of his son Vincent in the mayoralty contest in Vigan to a brother of Chavit in 1971 led to the end of his family&#x27;s political dominance in the province and the rise of the Singson family to prominence.

=== Contemporary history ===
==== 1986-87 Jose Burgos Jr provisional revolutionary governorship ====

When the People Power Revolution which ended on February 25, 1986 deposed Ferdinand Marcos from power, and installed Corazon Aquino as the new president of the Philippines, a provisional revolutionary government was set up in the country, and newspaper publisher Jose G. Burgos Jr. was appointed OIC Governor until a new constitution could be ratified and new officials elected.
====2020 COVID-19 pandemic ====

Executive Order No. 12 and Executive Order No. 13, were issued on March 12 and 13, 2020, respectively, mandating the suspension of classes at all levels from March 13 to April 12, 2020, as well as the suspension of other school activities that involve the gathering of crowds, at both public and private schools in the province. On March 15, the province was placed under community quarantine through Executive Order No. 14 which restricted the movement of people to and from Ilocos Sur, mandated the establishment of checkpoints and conditions for transportation and travel, prohibited social gatherings, encouraged flexible/alternative work arrangements or suspension of work, suspended tourism, prohibited hoarding, delineated rules for business establishments, and imposed a curfew.

After the approval of &quot;uniform travel protocols for land, air, and sea of the Department of the Interior and Local Government, crafted in close coordination with the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines, League of Provinces of the Philippines, League of Municipalities of the Philippines, and the League of Cities of the Philippines,&quot; in Resolution No. 101, Series of 2021, Ilocos Sur Governor Ryan Luis V. Singson issued Executive Order No. 22, Series of 2021, mandating the travel protocols for implementation in the province. The resolution institutionalized the use of the System Safe, Swift, and Smart Passage (S-PaSS) Travel Management System, and the executive order eliminated the mandatory testing requirement for persons in specific traveler classifications who seek to enter or pass through the province.

====2022 Luzon earthquake ====

Ilocos Sur was severely affected by the 2022 Luzon earthquake, which was felt strongly in Ilocos Sur for 30 seconds or longer. A total of 32 towns and two cities received damage, with the heaviest in Vigan. Nearly 100 homes were heavily damaged. Heritage sites in the UNESCO World Heritage City of Vigan were damaged, including the Vigan Cathedral and old-century houses, as well as few toppled power lines along Calle Crisologo.

===Inhabitants===

Ilocos Sur is inhabited mostly by Ilocanos belonging to the third largest ethnic group of Austronesian origin. A Spanish chronicler wrote that &quot;the people are very simple, domestic and peaceful, large of body and very strong. &quot;They are highly civilized. They are a most clean race, especially the women in their homes which they keep very neat and clean.&quot;

Miguel de Loarca records around 1582 that the Ilocanos are intelligent as the Zambaleños for they are farmers. The main occupation of the people is agriculture.

Father Juan de Medina noted in 1630 that the natives are &#x27;the humblest and most tractable known and lived in nest and large settlements&#x27;.

===Language===

Ilocano is the main language of the native majority in the province, with neighboring La Union recognized it as an official language since 2012. It became widespread in neighboring regions of Cagayan Valley (Region II), Cordillera Administrative Region and major parts of Central Luzon (Region III)—where Ilocanos settled—as a lingua franca among respective Ilocano and non-Ilocano residents. Ilocano is also recognized as a minority language in Mindoro, Palawan and Mindanao (particularly in some areas in Soccsksargen), where Ilocanos had have been significant residents since the early 20th century. It is a third most widely spoken language in the Philippines, estimating 11 million speakers as of 2022.

==Economy==


===Products and industries ===
The people are engaged in farming, producing food crops, mostly rice, corn, vegetable, root crops, and fruits. Non-food crops include tobacco, cotton, and tigergrass. Cottage industries include loom weaving, furniture making, jewelry making, ceramics, blacksmithing, and food processing.

===Agriculture===

Ilocos Sur&#x27;s economy is agrarian, but its of unfertile land is not enough to support a population of 338,579.

Agricultural crops such as rice, corn tobacco and fruit trees dominate their farm industries. Secondary crops are camote and cassava, sugar cane and onions.

The rapidly growing population, the decreasing fertility of the soil, and the long period between the planting and harvesting season, have forced the people to turn to manufacture and trade. Many Ilocanos go to the Cagayán valley, Central Plains and Mindanao to sell Ilocano woven cloth.

Virginia leaf tobacco is still a premier cash crop, after a windfall brought about by the Tobacco Subsidy Law authored by Congressman Floro Crisologo in 1964, and later enhanced by the Republic Act No. 7171 authored by Congressman Luis &quot;Chavit&quot; Singson.

Weaving is the most extensive handicraft, once bolstered by the installation of the NDC Textile Mills in Narvacan which supplied the weavers with yarn.

Other industries are burnay and slipper making in Vigan, furniture, cabinet, and statue making in San Vicente, mortar and pestle making in San Esteban, and bolo making in Santa.

==Infrastructure==

===Electricity===

All municipalities in Ilocos Sur are electrified, courtesy of the Ilocos Sur Electric Cooperative (ISECO).

==Education==
Ilocos Sur has 547 public schools including five general high schools, one university, one agricultural college and 56 private schools, 16 of which are Catholic.

The &quot;Ilocos Sur Museum&quot;, founded on August 22, 1970, has a collection of cultural treasures which include art include paintings, centuries-old sculptures, pieces of carved furniture, and relics of Spanish European and Chinese cultures that had influenced Ilocano life for centuries.

Chapters of Philippine history and religion are found in the Crisólogo collections which includes family heirlooms, centuries –old &quot;santos&quot; (religious statuettes made of wood or ivory), other ivory images, Vienna furniture, marble-topped tables, ancient-carved beds, rare Chinese porcelains, jars and jarlettes, lamps, Muslim brass wares, and Spanish and Mexican coins.

The Syquia collections, including then President Elpidio Quirino&#x27;s memorabilia, vie in quality with the Crisólogo collections. But in the midst of a fire scare in Vigan in the late 1908s and 1990s, the relics in the Syquia Mansion were transferred to Manila for safekeeping.

==UNESCO Recognitions in Ilocos Sur==
UNESCO has inscribed two Ilocos Sur sites in the World Heritage List.

===Heritage City of Vigan===
In 1999, the Heritage City of Vigan was inscribed in the World Heritage List. UNESCO describes the site as:

&quot;Established in the 16th century, Vigan is the best-preserved example of a planned Spanish colonial town in Asia. Its architecture reflects the coming together of cultural elements from elsewhere in the Philippines, from China and from Europe, resulting in a culture and townscape that have no parallel anywhere in East and South-East Asia.&quot;

===Santa Maria Basilica===
In 1993, the Baroque Churches of the Philippines, containing 4 properties, was inscribed in the World Heritage List. One of the properties was the Santa Maria Church of Ilocos Sur.

<text>La Union (), officially the Province of La Union (; ; ; ; ; ), is a coastal province in the Philippines situated in the Ilocos Region on the island of Luzon. The province&#x27;s capital, the City of San Fernando, is the most populous city in La Union and serves as the regional center of the Ilocos Region.

Bordered by Ilocos Sur to the north, Benguet to the east, and Pangasinan to the south, with the South China Sea to the west, La Union is located 273 kilometers (170 miles) north of Metro Manila and 57 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of Baguio City. The province spans an area of 1,497.70 square kilometers (578.27 square miles). As of the 2020 census, La Union had a population of 822,352, resulting in a density of 550 inhabitants per square kilometer or 1,400 per square mile. The province had 538,730 registered voters as of 2022. The province official language is Iloco (Ilocano), as declared by the provincial government of La Union.

La Union is renowned for its picturesque coastal towns, popular surfing spots, and pristine beaches. The province is rich in natural and cultural attractions, offering activities such as red clay pottery, grape picking, loom weaving, and pilgrimage tours to historic churches, alongside beautiful waterfalls and eco-tours. The population includes both the Ilocano people from the lowlands and the Cordilleran (Igorot) people from the highlands, contributing to its diverse cultural heritage.

==History==
===Early History===
During its early history, the province was inhabited by various ethnolinguistic groups, including the Ilocanos, Pangasinenses, and Cordillerans (Igorots), who actively engaged in trading and bartering while practicing animistic and polytheistic indigenous religions and traditions.

In the northern section, early settlements were established along the coastal plains of &quot;Purao&quot; (now Balaoan), Darigayos, and the areas surrounding the Amburayan River. These settlements were primarily inhabited by the &quot;Samtoy&quot; (Ilocanos). Historian William Henry Scott documented that Balaoan was historically referred to as being &quot;rich in gold&quot; due to its proximity to the gold mines in the Cordillera region. The town served as an emporium for the exchange of Igorot gold through barter and trade among lowlanders, highlanders, and foreign merchants in Tagudin. Similarly, &quot;Baratao&quot; (now Bauang) has been identified by historians as a settlement of comparable importance to Purao as emporium of gold mines.

In the southern section, the areas of Agoo and Aringuey (now Aringay) were early settlements of the Pangasinenses. Agoo functioned as a trading port with Sual as its only rival, frequented by Japanese and Chinese ships, whose merchants engaged in commerce or bartered gold with natives. Aringuey served as a coastal maritime trading hub and the terminus of the Aringay-Tonglo-Balatok gold trail, located along the delta of the Aringay (Ifugao) River. This route facilitated the transport of gold from the Ibaloi villages of &quot;Acupan&quot; and &quot;Balatok&quot; in the southern areas of present-day Benguet to the trading centers of Aringay, with further distribution to the port settlement of Agoo.

These trading activities were part of a larger maritime exchange network that extended across the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. Products exchanged within this network included porcelain, silk, cotton, beeswax, gems, beads, and precious minerals, with &quot;gold&quot; being a significant commodity. Artifacts like porcelain and pottery, uncovered during the renovation of the Catholic church in Agoo and now housed in the Museo de Iloko testify to this trade activity.

===Spanish Colonial Era===
==== 16th Century ====
A year after Miguel Lopez de Legazpi made Manila the capital of the Philippines on June 24, 1571, the Spaniards started the colonization in Northern Luzon &quot;to pacify the people in it&quot;.

In June 1572, Spanish explorers led by conquistador Juan de Salcedo, the grandson of Miguel López de Legazpi, navigated the Angalacan River to the Lingayen Gulf, where they encountered and attacked three Japanese ships. Following the retreat of the ships, Salcedo pursued them and arrived at a Japanese settlement in Agoo. The Japanese mercenaries and local natives were subjugated and required to pay tribute to the Spanish Crown. Although some resisted initially, those who complied were allowed to remain. This interaction earned Agoo the title &quot;el puerto de Japón&quot; (Japanese Port) as it had long been a hub for trade among Japanese, Chinese merchants, and natives.
Salcedo continued his expedition northward and arrived at what is now San Fernando. When he demanded tribute from the natives, they sought permission to ascend the mountains to gather their offerings but failed to return. Salcedo then proceeded to &quot;Atuley&quot; (modern-day San Juan) and further north until they encountered a large Ilocano settlement called &quot;Purao,&quot; referring to the gleaming white sands of its beaches along the South China Sea.When the natives of Purao refused to pay tribute, it led to the first recorded conflict in the Ilocos region, known as the &quot;Battle of Purao&quot;. This encounter resulted in the shedding of the first Ilocano blood in defiance of foreign rule. The river &quot;Purao&quot; was later renamed &quot;Darigayos,&quot; derived from the Iloco words &quot;dara&quot; (blood) and &quot;ayos&quot; (flowed), meaning &quot;where blood flowed.&quot; Continuing his journey, Salcedo arrived at Bigan (now Vigan), a settlement of Chinese traders, and formally established it as &quot;Villa Fernandina de Vigan&quot; in honor of Prince Ferdinand, the son of King Philip II of Spain.
==== 17th Century ====
By the 17th century, the Spanish had established settlements, or pueblos, organized into sitios and rancherias, in Igorot land in La Union. These were governed by a gobernadorcillo, alcalde-mayor and cabeza de barangay, with many of these settlements established by Augustinian friars during the 16th century&#x27;s expansion phase. 

Society during this period was divided into two classes: the babaknang and the cailianes. The &quot;baknang&quot; or &quot;babaknang&quot; means &quot;the rich&quot; and &quot;agtuturay&quot; or &quot;agturay&quot; refers to &quot;the powers-that be&quot; or &quot;the authorities.&quot; Propertied, landed, and educated, they formed the local elite class or were the principalia or insulares who spoke Castilian, On the other hand, the unlearned &quot;cailianes&quot; had less or no property that spoke Iloco, Pangasinan, Kankanai and Ibaloi. Iloco served as the province&#x27;s lingua franca.

The Spaniards&#x27; search for gold (oro) in Igorot territories fueled their expeditions. Religious orders were also motivated by opportunities for missionary work. By 1620, however, the gold trade had begun to decline in the province including the Aringay-Balatok-Tonglo, Bauang and Bangar gold trails. &quot;Captain Garcia de Aldana&quot; led expeditions into areas like Aringay, Bauang, and San Juan, while &quot;Sargento Mayor y Capitan Alonso Martin Quirante&quot; centralized the industry in 1624, deploying a force of 1,748 troops, including Spaniards, Chinese, Japanese, Mexicans, and 500 Ilocanos. Natives and mercenaries were often faced harassments forced to reveal gold sources. Many converted to Christianity to avoid persecution, while others fled to the Cordilleras. 

In 1661, Andrés Malong of Pangasinan, who declared himself king, led a rebellion against Spanish colonial rule in an attempt to liberate several areas in the northern pueblos of Pangasinan and the Ilocos provinces. As part of his campaign, Malong sought to reclaim Agoo from Spanish control. However, his forces, consisting of Pangasinenses, Zambals, and Negritos, suffered a decisive defeat during the &quot;Battle of Agoo&quot;. The Spanish, with their superior weaponry and strategic fortifications, successfully repelled the rebellion. 

==== 18th Century ====
In the early 1700s, Spanish missions in Agoo, Bauang, and Bacnotan aimed to convert resettled Igorots through the Spanish &quot;reducción policy&quot;, which subjected natives to harsh treatment. By 1739, friars discovered that Bangar engaged in barter trade with the Igorots in the east. Smuggling became rampant under the &quot;Tobacco Monopoly&quot; in the late 1700s, impacting Spanish revenues significantly by 1788. Despite Spanish efforts to control the highlands, the Igorots retained their autonomy well into the 19th century.

In 1754, Igorot chieftain &quot;Lacaaden of Bukiagan&quot; (now part of Tubao) negotiated with the Spaniards to avoid punitive expeditions by requesting missionaries for his people. This led to the baptism of Igorot chieftain in Tondo under &quot;Governor-General Pedro Manuel de Arandía Santisteban&quot;&quot;.&quot; However, resistance resumed in 1759, prompting Pangasinan &quot;Governor Arza&quot; to launch a military campaign. On March 18, Lacaaden led a five-hour battle against Spanish forces armed with rifles and artillery. The Igorots held their ground, forcing the Spaniards to retreat along what is now Naguilian Highway, burning villages along the way.

The town of Caba became notable as the birthplace of Diego Silang, leader of the &quot;Ilocos Revolt&quot; (1762–1765) during the British occupation of Manila. Silang persuaded the gobernadorcillo of Balaoan to encourage Ilocanos and Igorots in the town to join his anti-British struggle, which extended to the revolt in Vigan.

==== 19th Century ====
On February 2, 1818, the &quot;Real Cédula&quot; divided Ilocos Province into Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur after the Basi Revolt in 1807. The towns of Balaoan, Bangar, and Namacpacan (Luna) were incorporated into the province of Ilocos Sur on February 10, 1819.

In 1820, Don Agustin de Valencia, the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; of Bangar, and Don Agustin Decdec, an Igorot chieftain from Kayan, together with other Igorot leaders from Bacong and Cagubatan in Tagudin, formalized an Ilocano-Igorot &quot;bodong&quot; (peace pact). This agreement, facilitated by the &quot;Capitanes Pasados&quot;, reinstated highland-lowland trade, which had been disrupted three years earlier due to the killing of an Igorot in Tagudin and the subsequent retaliatory killing of an Ilocano from Bangar.

By 1826, the Spanish established the &quot;Commandancia del Pais de Ygorrotes y Partido del Norte de Pangasinan&quot; to combat tobacco smuggling. Lieutenant Colonel Guillermo Galvey led campaigns into the Cordilleras, using towns like Agoo, Bauang, Bacnotan, and San Juan as military bases.

From 18th to 19th century the coastal towns frequently faced raids by Moro marauders locally known as &quot;tirongs&quot; (raiders, attackers, pirates) and Chinese pirates, who looted barrios or villages and captured women and children. To counter these attacks, the Spaniards built circular adobe watchtowers, or baluartes, in 1836. These structures, ranging from 6 to 7 meters in height, were constructed along the coastline in towns such as Namacpacan (Luna), Balaoan, San Fernando, and Bauang. These baluartes played a crucial role in protecting coastal settlements and securing trade routes throughout the 19th century.

====Formation of La Union====
La Union was officially established on March 2, 1850, through the unification of territories from the provinces of Ilocos Sur, Pangasinan, and the Cordillera, making it the 34th province of the Philippines. After Cebu became the first provincia in 1565, new provinces have been created by the Spaniards. Three main functions were considered so: &quot;Political-Civil Administration, Ecclesiastical governance and Geographical considerations.&quot; For more than two and one-half centuries, the original Ilocos province remained intact until 1818 when it split into llocos Norte and Ilocos Sur. In 1846, Abra was created by Governor General Narciso Zaldua Claveria.

Governor General Narciso Zaldua Claveria was a visionary administrator who recognized the need for innovative solutions to address the demands of political and civil administration. He proposed combining three contiguous areas that were far from their respective provincial capitals, seeing it as a viable approach to improve governance. Claveria also recognized the agricultural and commercial potential of the territory. Moreover, he saw this initiative as an opportunity to extend Hispanic civilization and Christianity to the area.

Distance posed significant challenges to local administration. From Vigan, the capital of Ilocos Sur, the three southernmost pueblos (Balaoan, Namacpacan, and Bangar) were located approximately 13 to 14 hours away on foot. The &quot;cailianes&quot; and the &quot;babaknang&quot; often complained about the physical distance from their officials in the cabecera or capital town. Similarly, from Lingayen, the capital of Pangasinan, the nine northern pueblos (Santo Tomas, Agoo, Aringay, Cava, Bauang, Naguilian, San Fernando, San Juan, and Bacnotan) were also burdened by the 13 ½ hours of travel required from Bacnotan.

The situation was even worse for the 40 to 45 rancherías located in the depths of the &quot;Eastern País del Igorotes&quot;. The &quot;commandancia&quot; established in 1826 proved ineffective in maintaining order among the Igorrotes, whose remoteness from central authorities led to rampant smuggling of tobacco and other merchandise, thereby disrupting the region&#x27;s economic stability.Thus on October 29, 1849, Governor General Claveria signed the &quot;promovido&quot; (proposal) to unite the &quot;Pangasinan-Ilocos-Cordillera&quot; areas into a new province called La Union (the official name designated by Claveria himself) as San Fernando as &quot;cabecera&quot; (capital) and Amburayan River in the north and Rabon River in the south as provincial boundaries. For 124 days, high and important Spanish colonial officers studied and deliberated on the proposition to create La Union or not. 

On March 2, 1850, Governor General Antonio María Blanco signed the s&quot;uperior decreto&quot; that founded La Union – the 34th province since the founding of Cebu in 1565. It was classified as a &quot;Gobierno Politico-Militar&quot; (Political-Military Government). Blanco appointed, on March 4, 1850, &quot;Captain Toribio Ruiz de la Escalera&quot; (Claveria&#x27;s former trusted aide de camp) as the first Gobernador Military y Politico. La Union is the union of lands, people, cultures and resources. On April 18, 1854, Queen Isabella II of Spain issued the &quot;real orden&quot; (royal decree) from Madrid confirming Blanco&#x27;s s&quot;uperior decreto&quot;.

By 1869 and 1885 Rosario and Tubao became towns in La Union respectively. In 1869, &quot;Governor-General de la Torre&quot; converted Concepcion into Rosario, which remained spiritually dependent on Santo Tomas. Despite the bishop&#x27;s refusal to assign an assistant priest, Rosario became the 13th town, with its priest overseeing both towns. In 1885, after 12 years of petitions, Tubao was officially recognized as the 14th town as &quot;San Isidro de Tubao&quot;, named after the patron saint of farmers.

By 1860, there was significant progress in commerce and agriculture in the province. La Union became an exporter of tobacco, rice, and &quot;sibucao&quot; from the 1860s to the 1880s. Tobacco was the primary product and the reason for the province&#x27;s economic growth. Spanish authorities relied heavily on the prized leaf for further economic development. The industry was so lucrative that a &quot;Tobacco Monopoly&quot; was established. All tobacco leaves were strictly monitored and purchased exclusively by the government at a fixed price.

Simultaneously, other provinces were also experiencing economic growth. Relying on its own indigenous resources, La Union did not import rice, palay, tobacco, sibucao, or other products during this period.

By 1887, the province&#x27;s population had grown to 100,775. La Union&#x27;s heterogeneous population mingled throughout this period. The Chinos, or Mestizos de Sangley, Españoles-Peninsulares, and Españoles-Insulares coexisted with the native Pangasinenses, Ilocanos, and Igorots (particuallaly the Kankanai and Ibaloi), whether Christianized or non-Christianized. The Christianized Igorots or &quot;Nuevo Cristianos&quot; were often referred to as &quot;Vagos&quot; or &quot;Bago&quot;.

Gobernadores Politico-Militares of La Union (1850–1898)

The following is a list of Spanish &quot;Gobernadores Politico-Militares&quot; who served the province of La Union from its establishment in 1850 until the Philippine Revolution in 1898. During this period, approximately 32 individuals alternately held the titles of Gobernador Politico-Militar and Gobernador Militar-Politico. From 1890 to 1898, these officials were ranked as Gobernador Civil or Civil Gobernador by the superior gobierno, with the honorific title &quot;&quot;Don&quot;&quot; prefixed to their names.
=== Philippine Revolution ===
==== Philippine-Spanish War ====
The Philippine Revolution began in 1896, but La Union initially saw limited revolutionary activity. On November 15, 1896, the newspaper &quot;La Campaña de Filipinas&quot; reported that the provinces of Ilocos and La Union were &quot;not up in arms&quot; but showed &quot;sympathy for the uprising.&quot; Despite this initial passivity, the province eventually joined the struggle against Spanish colonial rule. In response, Spanish authorities enacted severe reprisals, including torture and false accusations, often targeting local elites, clergy, and suspected rebels.In 1896, three native coadjutor priests from La Union, &quot;Padre Adriano Garces&quot; of Balaoan, &quot;Padre Mariano Gaerlan&quot; of San Fernando, and &quot;Padre Mariano Dacanay&quot; of Bacnotan, were arrested and charged with masterminding a &quot;supposed conspiracy&quot; in La Union. They were brutally tortured by friars and the Guardia Civil in Vigan, enduring inhumane treatment that left lifelong scars on survivors like Padre Dacanay.

In Balaoan, a secret revolutionary group formed by seven prominent citizens namely; &quot;Luciano Resurreccion, Proceso Ostrea, Antonio Ostrea, Rufino Zambrano, Fernando Ostrea, Patricio Lopez&quot;, and &quot;Julian Peralta&quot;—sought to revolt against the tyranny of the Guardia Civil and &quot;Cora Parrocos&quot;. The group was betrayed by Captain Juan of Agoo to the friars. They were arrested, and without trial, executed by firing squad at the town cemetery. Only one of the men survived, having been wounded in the leg. In their honor, a Masonic lodge named &quot;Siete Martires&quot; was established.

In Agoo, around 60 suspected subversives were executed by the Guardia Civil and their bodies later interred in a corner of the town plaza. In nearby Aringay, 96 citizens were shot without trial by Spanish forces. A monument was later erected in the plaza to honor these patriots. On September 10, 1896, Spanish authorities, led by &quot;Friar Rafael Redondo&quot;, arrested &quot;Dr. Lucino Almeida&quot;, the highest-ranking native official in La Union, along with other suspected revolutionaries. They were accused of involvement in a fabricated conspiracy to assassinate Spanish officials, based on a false confession from a telegrapher. Almeida and 20 other prominent natives were exiled to Balabac Island, Palawan.

Despite these events, La Union was hailed as &quot;una provincia modelo&quot; (a model province) in 1897 by the pro-government &quot;El Comercio&quot; for its contributions to Spain&#x27;s defense. However, in 1898, the relative tranquility of La Union was shattered when an uprising and massacre in Santo Tomas ignited widespread agitation.

Uprising of 1898

The revolution in La Union began on May 22, 1898, with a small uprising in Santo Tomas. A shot from a small revolver (&quot;“una revolver pequeña”&quot;) was heard, igniting the &quot;“seditious movement of Union.”&quot; A single shot from this revolver ended the life of the much-hated Augustinian friar, &quot;Mariano Garcia&quot;, marking the end of Spanish rule in the province. The enraged revolutionaries stormed the convent, seized the priest, chained him, and beheaded him, his head rolled to the ground like a soccer ball. This act sparked a series of mass massacres &quot;(“hecatombes”)&quot; throughout the province. 

The subsequent violence led to the massacre of various individuals, including Garcia&#x27;s visitors and others. Women also became victims of brutal acts, with one storekeeper in San Fernando left mentally deranged. In San Juan, pro-Spanish inhabitants were massacred, while in Caba, pro-Spanish sympathizers were captured and held &quot;incommunicado&quot; in the mountains. In Bauang, revolutionaries clashed with Spanish soldiers and seized the town hall, led by &quot;Captain Remigio Patacsil&quot;.From May to August 1898, citizens of La Union fought several heroic battles against the Spanish forces in key towns such as Darigayos (Luna), Bacnotan, Rabon (Rosario), San Fernando, Bangar, and Balaoan. Despite heavy losses and diminishing supplies, Spanish forces under &quot;Lieutenant Colonel Jose Herreros&quot; mounted a five-day defense in &quot;Casa Real&quot;. However, they were eventually overwhelmed by revolutionaries in towns like Bangar, Bacnotan, and Balaoan, and the Spaniards were forced to surrender. The final stand in Balaoan saw Spanish forces barricaded in the convent, but despite their valiant defense, they were outmaneuvered, and many escaped to Ilocos Sur.

On July 22, Novo-Ecijano troops, reinforced to over 600 men, arrived in San Fernando after Dagupan surrendered to &quot;General Francisco Makabulos&quot;. The town was under siege by revolutionaries led by &quot;General&quot; &quot;Mauro Ortiz&quot;. Spanish forces, commanded by &quot;Lieutenant Colonel Jose Garcia Herrero&quot;, fortified themselves in key buildings, awaiting reinforcements. The ensuing battle lasted for 120 hours, with the Spanish troops enduring extreme conditions. &quot;Major Ceballos&quot;, who had surrendered in Dagupan, attempted to negotiate the surrender of Spanish forces in San Fernando, ultimately convincing Herreros to capitulate. The proud Spaniards with the &quot;Cuerpos de Voluntaries&quot; (Corps of Volunteers) did not simply put up the white flag. This led to the signing of the &quot;Actas de Capitulaciones&quot; (Acts of Surrender), and San Fernando became the 13th of 29 towns to witness Spanish surrender, with 400 soldiers and eight officers capitulating.

After securing San Fernando, the Tinio Brigade and other revolutionaries continued north from July 31 to August 18, 1898. Key battlegrounds included the rice fields of San Juan, Bacnotan, Namacpacan, Balaoan, and Bangar. Many local Katipuneros joined the Tinio Brigade after this ordeal, which saw stubborn resistance from entrenched Spanish troops in the convent.

Final Victory 
In the Amburayan Valley, Spanish forces built defensive trenches and placed bamboo traps. However, the revolutionaries, buoyed by previous victories, attacked with renewed vigor. In San Juan, they burned municipal buildings and the homes of Spanish insulares, resulting in a massacre of over 100 families attempting to flee. In Agoo, pro-Spanish sympathizers were captured and executed in the mountains.

As Spanish forces retreated, they reinforced their positions in Balaoan and Bangar, but revolutionaries quickly fortified their own defenses. Any potential reinforcements from neighboring provinces were blocked. In Darigayos Cove, Filipino rebels burned all anchored boats, preventing escape by sea. The revolutionaries then moved to Bangar, successfully besieging the Spanish forces, resulting in a decisive victory on August 7, 1898. The surrender of 87 Spaniards marked a significant milestone, with the remaining forces fleeing to Ilocos after just four days of fighting, which saw minimal Filipino casualties.

By August 18, 1898, La Union had achieved final victory, marking the definitive collapse of Spanish resistance in the province. This victory brought the revolutionaries closer to their ultimate goal of freedom from Spanish colonial rule.

==== Philippine-American War ====
The Philippine-American War in La Union began on the night of February 4-5, 1899, marked by the ringing of church bells across the province. By April 1899, Filipino guerrillas, under the command of General Manuel Tinio, had prepared for combat, constructing trenches throughout the province. Tinio&#x27;s forces numbered 1,904, including 68 officers, 200 bolo men &quot;hermano&quot;, 284 auxiliaries such as armorers, telegraphers, medical corpsmen, cavalry, artillerymen, and two Spanish engineers stationed in Northern Luzon.

On November 16, 1899, President Emilio Aguinaldo arrived in La Union via the Tubao trail, making his way to Aringay, where he was welcomed by the townspeople (&quot;cailianes&quot;) and elites (&quot;babaknang&quot;). From Aringay, Aguinaldo continued his journey through Cava, Bauang, and Naguilian where they spent the night in convent. 

On November 18, 1899, American forces under General Samuel Baldwin Marks Young entered La Union, landing in Rosario via &quot;Rabon Point&quot; along the coast in pursuit of Aguinaldo. At dusk, American forces engaged 130 Filipino revolutionaries at Tubao, commanded by Captain Santiago Fontanilla&quot;,&quot; who led a force of four officers and 87 rifles. The Americans then moved toward Aringay, where Major Matthew Arlington Batson led an attack on the town the following morning. He was wounded in a skirmish with Guerrilla Unit No. 5, an event known as the &quot;Battle of Aringay River&quot;. 

Throughout the week, heavy fighting ensued between American forces and five Filipino guerrilla units in La Union led by Colonel Juan M. Gutierrez: 

* Guerrilla Unit 1: Operated in Bangar, Namacpacan (Luna), and Sudipen under &quot;Captain Anacleto Mendoza&quot;. 
* Guerrilla Unit 2: Operated in Balaoan, Bacnotan, and Santol (rancheria of Balaoan) under &quot;Captain Aniceto Angeles&quot;. 
* Guerrilla Unit 3: Operated in San Juan, San Fernando, San Gabriel, and Bagulin under &quot;Captain Furtunato Gaerlan&quot;. 
* Guerrilla Unit 4: Operated in Bauang, Caba, Naguilian, and Galiano (now Burgos) under &quot;Captain Rivera&quot;. 
* Guerrilla Unit 5: Operated in Aringay, Tubao, Agoo, and Santo Tomas under &quot;Captain Santiago Fontanilla&quot;. 

Simultaneous battles were fought across various towns, including Santo Tomas, Aringay, Naguilian, Bauang, and San Fernando. By November 19, the Americans had taken Santo Tomas and Agoo. On November 20, General Young entered San Fernando where describe the town as &quot;“series of the most formidable entrenchments,”&quot; capturing the revolutionary headquarters and estimating the presence of 1,000 Filipino insurgents. Several revolutionaries were captured.

Meanwhile, Aguinaldo continued his escape, traveling through the mountain roads of San Fernando, San Juan, and Bacnotan, narrowly evading capture. Upon reaching Balaoan, he learned of a plot to avenge General Antonio Luna, who had been killed five days earlier. This plot, intended to unfold in Luna&#x27;s mother’s hometown of Namacpacan (now Luna), was thwarted by Doña Laureana Luna y Novicio. 

On November 21, Aguinaldo arrived in Bangar, escorted by General Tinio, before continuing his journey to Ilocos Sur. On the same day, La Union&#x27;s &quot;insurrecto governor&quot;, Dr. Don Lucino Almeida y Almendrada, paid a courtesy call to General Young, offering assistance to the U.S. government. By November 23, Young reaches Namacpacan (now Luna).

While seemingly cooperating with U.S. forces, Almeida secretly supported the Filipino guerrillas by establishing a network with town leaders and chieftains. He mobilized resources such as money, rice, and provisions for the guerrillas, and his &quot;haciendas&quot; in San Juan, Balaoan, and Bacnotan served as covert guerrilla hideouts. 

From January to February 1900, the Tinio Brigade engaged in several battles against American forces in La Union, achieving notable victories despite being outnumbered. In January, they repelled American forces at Malabita, San Fernando and ambushed a 40-man patrol near Bangar. 

In February, they conducted additional ambushes at Sabang, Bacnotan, Panicsican, San Juan, and Kagunan in Balaoan. On February 26, they successfully retaliated against an ambush between San Juan and Bacnotan, killing several American troops, including a captain-doctor, and capturing supplies.

By April 1900, Colonel William Penn Duvall, the U.S. military governor of San Fernando, grew suspicious of Almeida&#x27;s activities. First Lieutenant William Thomas Johnston was assigned to investigate Almeida&#x27;s involvement in the resistance. After months of scrutiny, Almeida was court-martialed on June 3, 1900, and exiled to Guam in January 1901. 

Following Almeida&#x27;s conviction, local leaders in San Fernando, Bacnotan, San Juan, Tubao, Agoo, and Rosario ceased supporting the guerrillas. Many of Almeida&#x27;s former supporters switched allegiances to save themselves, earning the nickname chameleons or &quot;balimbings.&quot; Johnston&#x27;s anti-guerrilla efforts, aided by local spies, contributed to the overall pacification campaign. One of them, &quot;Crispulo Patajo&quot; native from Bauang, served as a spy, scout and leader for the U.S. forces to suppress guerrilla resistance in the province.

On April 17, 1900, Patajo&#x27;s forces attacked and pacified the guerrilla presence in Barrio Castro, Bangar, capturing weapons and forcing insurgents to retreat. From May to June 1900, Crispulo Patajo led successful anti-guerrilla operations throughout La Union. He attacked Fontanilla&#x27;s band in the Pagalan Mountains on May 26, killing 10 insurgents and capturing 13 rifles. His forces continued to clear towns like Naguilian, Bauang, and Aringay, killing or capturing guerrillas. 

In San Fernando, Patajo pacified the town in one week, capturing officers and securing rifles. He also targeted northern towns like San Juan and Bacnotan, eliminating a guerrilla company and capturing 80 rifles. Despite these successes, Colonels Juan Gutierrez and Joaquin Luna managed to escape and relocated their camp further north. 

Between March and April 1901, guerrilla forces led by Aniceto Angeles, Sixto Hipolito, and Santiago Fontanilla engaged in skirmishes with American troops in various areas, including Sitio Guilong (Balaoan), Sitio Kalumboyan (Balaoan), Sitio Nabual (Bacnotan), and Barrio Castro (Bangar) that leads Major Aniceto Angeles withdraws. While they achieved some victories, their effectiveness diminished due to internal divisions, lack of discipline, and the failure to maintain unity. 

By May 1, 1901, the Tinio Brigade surrendered to the Americans in Sinait, Ilocos Sur, marking the end of the Philippine-American War in La Union and the surrounding region.

===American Colonial Era===
After the Philippine-American War, La Union, like much of the country, faced widespread chaos. La Union revolutionary leaders such as Capt. Aniceto Angeles, Francisco Peralta, and Col. Juan M. Gutierrez were executed through public hanging and firing squad in Bangar and San Fernando town plaza, underscoring the conflict’s harsh aftermath.

From 1899 to 1901, La Union was under military rule, with Colonel William Penn Duvall administering both the province and Benguet beginning on March 18, 1900. During this time, both the elites (&quot;babakanang&quot;) and townspeople (&quot;cailianes&quot;) endured forced relocations, extrajudicial killings, sexual assaults and significant property damage. This period of military governance, however, was short-lived. 

In 1901, La Union transitioned to &quot;civilian governance&quot;, signaling the start of a more organized and democratic system inspired by American models. The transition marked a shift from the &quot;spiritualism&quot; enforced by the Catholic friars under Spanish rule to a secular system. 

Despite this shift, U.S. military leaders, including Colonel Duvall, resisted relinquishing power and frequently clashed with the Philippine Commission, led by Civil Governor William Howard Taft. The conflict escalated to U.S. Secretary of War Elihu Root, who intervened to ensure La Union’s formal adoption of civilian governance on August 15, 1901. 

Don Joaquin Vicente Eulogio J. Ortega became La Union&#x27;s first civilian governor, ushering in a new era of governance. However, key positions, such as the provincial treasurer, remained under American control. The colonial administration also prioritized education, suffrage, civil rights, and political participation, thus empowering Filipinos to engage in the democratic process. 

Introducing the Thomasites—American teachers tasked with promoting &quot;Americanization.&quot; English became the primary medium of instruction, aiming to instill American ideals. A notable example of this initiative’s success is Camilo Osias, a student from Balaoan, who pursued studies in the U.S. and later emerged as a respected educator and public servant. By 1902, La Union&#x27;s education system had grown to include 89 schools spread across various &quot;pueblos&quot; (towns). A total of 8,917 pupils were enrolled—5,652 boys and 3,265 girls—constituting 15% of the province&#x27;s population. Schools were established in key towns like San Fernando, Bangar, Rosario, Aringay, Cava, Agoo, Balaoan and Namacpacan (Luna), with some operating in repurposed Spanish-era convents. 

In 1902, public health boards were established to address health crises such as cholera outbreaks. Measures taken during the 1902 epidemic proved effective in curbing a severe outbreak in 1908–1909. Governor Sixto Lachica Zandueta championed the establishment of a resident health officer for La Union, leading to the creation of a sub-health district by 1910. Public health continued to improve under Governor General Francis Burton Harrison (1913–1921), with coordinated efforts significantly reducing cholera cases by 1914. 
In 1902, Camp Wallace was established on Poro Islet, San Fernando, under Captain Frank Tompkins, as it was considered a strategic location. The U.S. formally acquired it as a military reservation on September 1, 1903, and the War Department set guidelines for its creation on October 13, 1903. Governor Joaquin Ortega supported the establishment of a permanent military post in San Fernando, endorsing a petition signed by 2,637 citizens on August 9, 1902.

The integration of non-Christian tribes from the Cordilleras, referred to as the &quot;“taga-Montañosa,”&quot; became another priority. In 1902, Governor Taft proposed incorporating these groups into the municipal code or merging them with Benguet. By 1905, tensions between Bangar’s lowlanders and mountain communities led to court interventions. In 1906, Igorot settlements were transferred to sub-provinces of Benguet and Amburayan under Lepanto-Bontoc province to resolve jurisdictional and tax-related disputes. By 1911, many non-Christians sought permission to resettle in lowland areas.

By 1912, Christianized Igorot &quot;Bago&quot; communities in Rosario, Tubao, San Fernando, San Juan, and Bacnotan were fully integrated. Boundary adjustments and the conversion of mountain settlements into townships followed, with Pugo officially becoming a township on December 11, 1911. Despite proposals for a new province, the municipal districts of Sudipen, San Gabriel, Santol, Pugo, Bagulin, and Burgos remained part of La Union. These districts served as models of harmonious Christian-Igorot relations during the colonial period. By 1920, San Gabriel, Pugo, Sudipen, and Santol became official towns under &quot;Section 2 of Act No. 2877&quot;, or the &quot;Revised Administrative Code of the Philippine Islands&quot;; Bagulin followed in 1922, and Burgos in 1925, under &quot;Executive Order No. 54.&quot;

Under Governor General William Cameron Forbes (1909–1913), infrastructure development flourished in La Union. Roads, airports, ports and railways (Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan) were expanded, with the rail line reaching Aringay in 1910 and Bauang in 1918. This enhanced connectivity significantly boosted the local economy, particularly in southern La Union, by linking it to Dagupan. Major projects included the construction of the &quot;Taboc Bridge&quot; on the &quot;San Juan-Bacnotan Road&quot;, the Bauang-Naguilian Road, the &quot;Bacnotan-Balaoan Wagon Road&quot;, the &quot;San Fernando Wharf&quot;, and the Amburayan River irrigation system, which supported tobacco and rice fields, bolstering agriculture and trade. By 1915, under Governor Mauro Ortiz, the &quot;Naguilian Road&quot; was extended to Baguio, the &quot;San Fernando Port&quot; became operational, the &quot;Balaoan-Bacnotan Road&quot; was initiated, and the &quot;Baroro&quot; and &quot;Darigayos Bridges&quot; were completed. By 1921, over 150 kilometers of roads had been developed, facilitating commerce and the transportation of goods. 

The transition to the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935 granted La Union greater autonomy and opportunities for political engagement, though colonial structures persisted. This era fostered local development while reinforcing American influence. Full independence remained elusive until the Philippines gained sovereignty in 1946.

The American colonial period left a mixed legacy in La Union. While it brought modernization in education, infrastructure, and public health, it also entrenched colonial dependency and caused lasting cultural and social impacts. The memory of resistance and the province&#x27;s enduring struggle for identity continues to shape its historical narrative and aspirations for self-determination. 

As the Filipinos awaited independence under the Tydings-McDuffie Act, World War II erupted, further delaying their aspirations for sovereignty.

===Japanese Occupation===
The Japanese invasion of La Union during World War II was a pivotal moment in the province&#x27;s history, given its strategic importance to both Allied and Japanese forces. In December 8, 1941, Japan launched an attack on U.S. military installations including the Camp Wallace and residential areas in the province, following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

By December 11, the Japanese forces had successfully captured Vigan and dispatched additional troops to seize Laoag and its airfield. As American forces retreated, Lieutenan Gen. Masaharu Homma left a small garrison in Vigan and redirected the main forces to support operations at Lingayen Gulf.

By December 20, the combined forces of the Col. Kanno and Gen. Shizuichi Tanaka Detachments advanced south along Route 3. By December 21, 1941, Japanese forces had occupied Bacnotan following the successful overcoming of Philippine defenses in the area. On December 22, they advanced to San Fernando further consolidating their position. Japanese troops also landed in Agoo and swiftly established control over the town by early 1942. Despite these rapid advances, Filipino and American forces continued to resist the Japanese occupation, contributing to the broader efforts of the Allied campaign in the Philippines.

Battle of Rosario (Invasion of Lingayen Gulf) 
On December 22, 1941, the Japanese 4th Tank Regiment and the 47th Infantry Regiment under the command of Col. Isamu Yanagi, supported by a massive flotilla of navy ships tried to land in Agoo to make it one of three major beachheads for the Japanese Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, although weather dispersed their forces and made them deploy on a wide stretch of beach that ranged from Poro Point (San Fernando) to as far south as Damortis. These forces later met the commonwealth defence forces—consisting of the 26th Cavalry Regiment (Philippine Scouts), the Philippine 21st Division, the Philippine 11th Division, and the newly formed Philippine 71st Division—in what would later be called the Battle of Rosario.

During the Japanese occupation in the province, La Union was governed by Gov. Jorge Camacho (1941–1942), Gov. Bonifacio Tadiar (1942–1944), and Gov. Bernardo Gapuz (1945) under the administration of President José P. Laurel&#x27;s Japanese-sponsored &quot;puppet&quot; government. The province endured strict military controls, forced labor, food shortages, and widespread violence including extrajudicial killings and sexual violence. Despite these conditions, resistance movements emerged, with many residents engaging in guerrilla warfare against Japanese forces. Guerrilla camps was established all over the province including Camp Spencer in Darigayos, Luna and Camp 121 and Barrio San Cristobal in Bangar.

Mangkaeng Massacre

In Naguilian, over 400 refugees from the barrios of Imelda, Natividad, and Ortiz sought refuge in the small, forested sitio of Mangkaeng in barrio Gusing Norte to escape Japanese forces stationed in the town proper as part of General Tomoyuki Yamashita’s rear guard during his retreat to the Cordillera mountains. The area served as a strategic route for Japanese soldiers traveling between lowland and Cordillera camps particularly Baguio.

On the early morning of January 23, 1945, Japanese troops launched a sudden and brutal attack on Mangkaeng, aiming to eliminate potential resistance or witnesses. The unarmed villagers were caught off guard as gunfire (bayonet) erupted, killing men, women, and children. Some families attempted to flee into nearby creeks and the dense forest, hoping for cover, but the soldiers were relentless, pursuing and killing those who tried to escape. Others hid in nearby caves or bushes, clinging to the hope of survival while hearing the cries of those captured. Some survivors managed to reach neighboring villages, where they warned others of the massacre, spreading shock and grief across the province.

Battle of Baroro

On January 4, 1945, Filipino-American forces captured the Baroro Bridge in Bacnotan, marking a significant turning point in the liberation of the province during World War II. The bridge, a vital link connecting Northern Luzon to San Fernando, was a strategic objective for the Allied forces. The operation began with an assault by the 121st Infantry Regiment of the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines, Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL), against Japanese positions along the south bank of the Baroro River. The battle was characterized by heavy exchanges of gunfire, with the Filipino-American troops ultimately securing the bridge after intense fighting. This victory played a crucial role in ensuring the liberation of La Union and was followed by subsequent operations, including the &quot;Battle of San Fernando&quot; and the capture of Bacsil Ridge. 

Battle of San Fernando 
Following the Battle of Baroro, Allied forces launched a concerted attack on Japanese strongholds to the south of Baroro. This included operations targeting key enemy positions along Oaig Creek, where it crossed the San Fernando–Camasin Road, as well as strategic locations such as Reservoir Hill, Insurrecto Hill, and the Bacsil–Apaleng Range. These assaults took place during the second week of February 1945 as part of the broader campaign to secure San Fernando and its surrounding areas.

By March 24, 1945, after the Battle in Bacsil Ridge Allied forces had successfully secured the entire San Fernando area. This victory enabled the establishment of a critical military base &quot;Camp Wallce&quot; at Poro Peninsula, which became the headquarters for U.S. Army Base M. The area also served as a vital build-up zone for the projected invasion of Japan, marking a crucial step in the Allied preparations for the final stages of the Pacific War.

Battle of Bacsil Ridge

The Battle of Bacsil Ridge was fought in March 1945 was one of the continued main battles of the Philippines Campaign of the Second World War are between the Filipino soldiers under the 121st Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP-NL, under the command of Russell W. Volckmann, and the Japanese Imperial forces under by General Tomoyuki Yamashita.

The Battle of Bacsil Ridge ended the month-long battle for control of San Fernando. The Japanese defenders called the Hayashi Detachment, composed of 3,000 armed troops and 2,000 unarmed support forces, took hold of San Fernando and its surrounding areas which denied entry to the port of the town and a road leading to Baguio. As part of the San Fernando-Bacsil Operations, the 1st Battalion of 121st Infantry were sent to loosen the enemy positions starting late February with the assistance of the Allied Air Force.

The 1st Battalion made a general attack to the ridge on 16 March 1945 and fought the Japanese defenders until the capture of Bacsil on 19 March. On the same day, the 3rd battalion captured the Reservoir Hill. The Battle of Bacsil Ridge between the Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas and the Japanese Forces resulted in the recapture of San Fernando, La Union. Which resulted in the capture of San Fernando, La Union on 23 March 1945, and Bacnotan, La Union and the military offensive throughout the province ended on 24 March after two months of fighting.

Liberation of BauangThe Liberation of Bauang, was part of the San Fernando-Bascil operations aimed to liberate the province of La Union and open one of the roads to Baguio. Units from Rosario, La Union including elements of the 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry of the United States Army Forces in the Philippines – Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL) under the command of Major Diego Sipin, were tasked to make the northward advance to Bauang. 

The 2nd Battalion, 121st Infantry, USAFIP-NL reinforce the other battalions in the efforts to capture San Fernando. Meanwhile, combat units from the “B” company, 1st Battalion, 121st Infantry, USAFIP-NL attacked the defensive lines in Bauang to aid the 1st Battalion, 130th Infantry (US) in its advance from the south. Bauang was first liberated on 19 March 1945, followed by the declaration of the end of operations at La Union on 24 March 1945. On January 4, 1945, La Union was liberated by the Battle of San Fernando and Bacsil Ridge.

As San Fernando was in ruins at the time, Bacnotan became the provisional seat of the province administration after the war. The La Union National High School was also relocated to Bacnotan as a result of this relocation. When things returned to normal, the provincial government was relocated to San Fernando, followed by the La Union National High School. The North Provincial High School was established after the provincial high school in Bacnotan was transferred (now Bacnotan National High School).

===Post-war Era ===
The postwar recovery period marked a return of the tobacco industry to the Ilocos Region. Ever since the end of the tobacco monopoly, tobacco production had declined in the Ilocos as filipinos started shifting from locally made cigars to foreign made cigarettes. But after reading a feature article series by Maximo Soliven which explained why Virginia tobacco would grow well on Ilocos soil, businessman Harry Stonehill was convinced to invest extensively in rebuilding the industry, establishing the Philippine Tobacco Flue-Curing and Redrying Corporation (PTFCRC) in 1951 and recruiting farmers from throughout Region 1 to produce tobacco. The following year, La Union Congressman Manuel T. Cases filed a bill to &quot;limit the importation of foreign leaf tobacco,&quot; which was eventually signed by President Elpidio Quirino as Republic Act 698. This allowed Stonehill&#x27;s investments to make a handsome profit, and the newly-rebuilt local industry to bloom. Stonehill was later deported a decade later, in the 1960s, for tax evasion and bribery of government officials, in what would later be called the Stonehill scandal, but the tobacco industry continued to grow.

===During the Marcos Dictatorship===
Although economically affected by the rapid peso devaluation brought about by unbridled election spending heading into the 1969 presidential elections, political life in La Union was not significantly impacted by Ferdinand Marcos’ declaration of Martial Law in 1972.

The powerful family factions which had dominated La Union politics since before the American colonial era largely remained in place, although the family of Congressman Jose D. Aspiras became much more prominent after he became Marcos’ Tourism Minister. The main political change was the increased power of regional and provincial offices of national agencies, whose directors were answerable directly to Marcos.

This technique used by Marcos to consolidate political power did not get much resistance in the Ilocos Region, including La Union, which had strong ethnic associations with the Marcos family. The Marcos administration&#x27;s use of violent methods for stifling dissent thus mostly took place in other, non-Ilocano provinces, such as nearby Abra, Kalinga, and Mountain Province. Long-time second district congressman Manuel T. Cases had formed an alliance with Marcos along with the other strongman congressmen of the Ilocos Region, and his successor Jose D. Aspiras was also a close associate of Marcos who was made Minister of Tourism after Martial Law was declared.

But there were still La Union natives who were willing to object to the authoritarian practices and abuses of the Marcos administration, despite personal risk. This included San-Fernando-raised student activists Romulo and Armando Palabay, UP Students and La Union National High School alumni who were imprisoned for their protest activities, tortured at Camp Olivas in Pampanga, and later separately killed before the end of Martial Law. Romulo (age 22) and Armando (age 21) were posthumously honored when their names were etched on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the heroes and martyrs who fought the authoritarian regime.

Agoo, La Union, native Antonio L. Mabutas had become Archbishop of Davao by the time of Martial Law, and spoke actively against the human rights abuses of that time, particularly the torture and killings of church workers. The pastoral letter he wrote against Martial law, “Reign of Terror in the Countryside,” is notable for having been the first pastoral to be written against Marcos&#x27; martial law administration, and even doubly notable because Mabutas was considered a conservative within the Catholic church hierarchy in the Philippines.

==== 1990 Luzon earthquake ====

La Union was severely hit by the 1990 Luzon earthquake. Five municipalities in La Union were affected: Agoo, Aringay, Caba, Santo Tomas, and Tubao with a combined population of 132,208. Many buildings, including the Agoo Municipal hall, the Museo de Iloko, the parish church of Aringay, and the Basilica Minore of our Lady of Charity, collapsed or were severely damaged. 100,000 families were displaced when two coastal villages sank due to liquefaction. The province suffered many casualties leaving 32 people dead.

==== 2010s Tourism Boom ====
From the mid-2000s to the early 2010s, an influx of entrepreneurs began putting up establishments such as boho-chic-style art hostels and third-wave coffeeshops in San Juan and Agoo. They were initially attracted to the already-established surfing scene of Barangay Urbiztondo in San Juan, but eventually envisioned business in the province as an alternative to the stresses of city-based employment. This coincided with the phase-by-phase opening of the Tarlac–Pangasinan–La Union Expressway (TPLEX), which made La Union more accessible to tourists from Metro Manila.

Alongside the rising influence of social media outlets Twitter and Instagram, these factors led to a drastic tourism boom that made San Juan—previously been seen as just one of the Philippines&#x27; many surfing venues—a major backpacker&#x27;s destination whose attractions centered on surfing and art.

San Juan began to be featured prominently in independent films such as Jay Abello&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;Flotsam&quot; and JP Habac&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;I&#x27;m Drunk, I Love You&quot;, and the province began to be referred to by the colloquial initialism “ElYu.”

Among Philippines literary circles, the town of Bauang has also become a pilgrimage site of sorts for celebrating the life of and works of writer and World War II martyr Manuel Arguilla, with writers visiting the author&#x27;s hometown to experience the landscapes that inspired him, and which featured prominently in his stories. The most prominent event celebrating Arguilla was the 2017 run of the Taboan Literary Festival, a celebration of Philippine literature which changes venues every year, organized by the National Commission on Culture and the Arts during every National Arts Month in February. Among the prominent artists who spoke about Arguilla at the festival were writer-academic Butch Dalisay and National Artist of the Philippines for literature Bienvenido Lumbera.

==Geography==
La Union, located in the southwestern part of the Ilocos Region, is bordered to the north and northeast by Ilocos Sur, to the south by Pangasinan, to the east by Benguet, and to the west by the Lingayen Gulf and South China Sea. Geographically, it lies 273 kilometers north of Metro Manila and 57 kilometers northwest of Baguio City. 

Among the provinces in the Ilocos Region, La Union is the smallest in terms of land area, covering 149,309 hectares, which constitutes 11.60% of the region&#x27;s total land area and about 0.5% of the entire country. The province is divided into two districts. District I, comprising 70,069 hectares (46.93% of the province&#x27;s land area), includes San Gabriel, the largest municipality, with 15,500 hectares, followed by the City of San Fernando with 10,688 hectares, while Luna is the smallest. District II covers 79,240 hectares (53.07% of the province), with Bagulin having the largest area, followed by Aringay, while Santo Tomas occupies the least space.

=== Topography ===
La Union’s topography is predominantly hilly, gradually rising eastward from its coastal plains. The province’s physiography can be classified into four primary surface configurations: coastal plains, coastal hills, broad interior valleys, and mountain ridges with narrow valleys. These landforms have been shaped by coral alluvium (sand and clay) deposited by flowing water.

The coastal plains of La Union are narrowest near Damortis and Santo Tomas, and widest near Balaoan, extending up to 15 kilometers inland. Along the South China Sea, the coastal plains transition sharply to steep ranges, with elevated areas in Santo Tomas, Agoo, Bauang, and Balaoan, and gentler slopes in Bacnotan, San Fernando, and San Juan. 

These towns also features mangrove swamps, and the soils in this area are &quot;sandy&quot; and &quot;saline&quot;, particularly in southern San Fernando and surrounding areas. Coastal hills in La Union rarely exceed 300 meters in elevation, merging with the Cordillera mountain ranges to form narrow valleys. The soils in these areas are primarily heavy loam and clay, which are common in Agoo, Aringay, Santo Tomas, and Rosario, while northern San Fernando is characterized by gravelly, eroded loam.

The eastern frontier of the province is predominantly mountainous, dominated by the Gran Cordillera mountain ranges, specifically the Central and Northern Cordillera, which run parallel to the South China Sea coast. The highest peak in the province is located in Bagulin, at an elevation of 1,200 feet, with other elevated areas found in San Gabriel and Burgos. The fertile, fan-shaped interior valleys in San Juan, San Fernando, and Balaoan, formed by river delta sediments, are crucial for agriculture, though they are prone to flooding during heavy rainfall.

Salty-loam and alluvial soils, which are ideal for crops such as rice and tobacco, are prevalent in Naguilian, Aringay, Bauang, Balaoan, and Luna. The eastern mountain ranges, characterized by steep slopes and narrow valleys, are covered with reddish, clayish soils, particularly in Bacnotan, Agoo, San Fernando, San Juan, and Bauang, which are not suitable for agricultural use.

La Union is home to nine valleys—four in the northern part of the province (Bangar, Balaoan, Bacnotan, San Juan) and five in the south (Tubao, Aringay, Santo Tomas, Rosario, Naguilian)—which support agricultural land. These valleys are crossed by narrow, turbulent rivers. Further to the east, elevated plateaus and peaks that rise dramatically.

The province is traversed by eight principal rivers, most of which originate in the Cordillera Central Mountains and flow into the South China Sea and Lingayen Gulf:

* Amburayan River: The largest river in the province, it passes through San Gabriel, Sudipen, and Bangar, marking the northern boundary between Ilocos Sur and La Union before flowing into the South China Sea.
* Bued River: Flows through Pugo and Rosario, draining into the Lingayen Gulf, marking the southern boundary with Pangasinan.
* Aringay River: Class B River Basin with a length of 45km that originates in Benguet, passes through Pugo, Tubao, and Aringay, and flows into both the South China Sea and Lingayen Gulf.
* Baroro River: A length of 22.2km that starts in the mountains of San Gabriel, crossing San Gabriel, San Juan, and Bacnotan, and flows into the South China Sea. 
* Maluyo River (also known as Bucilac River): Flows through Santol, Balaoan, and Bangar, marking regional boundaries.
* Naguilian-Bauang River (also known as Balili River): Originates in La Trinidad, Benguet, and flows through Bagulin, Naguilian, and Bauang to the South China Sea.
* Maragayap River: Passes through San Gabriel, Balaoan, and Bacnotan, eventually flowing into the South China Sea.
* Darigayos River: Flows from the mountains behind Balaoan to Darigayos Cove, emptying into the South China Sea.

La Union’s coastal rim is indented by four bays or coves: San Fernando (at the central point), San Juan in the northeast, Darigayos in the northwest, and Santo Tomas in the southwest.

Land use in La Union is varied. Forests and wooded areas cover 41,240 hectares (27.62%), enhancing its biodiversity. Agriculture dominates, occupying 54,701 hectares (36.64%), while grasslands and shrublands account for 22,834 hectares (15.29%). Urban development takes up 15,555 hectares (10.42%), alongside 14,788 hectares (3.30%) of bare land, and 191 hectares (0.13%) are classified as wetlands.

=== Climate ===
According to Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), La Union experiences a 1st Climatic Type of the Köppen Climate Classification, which is characterized by two distinct seasons: a dry season from November to April and a wet season from May to October. The Southwest Monsoon (SWM) brings heavy rainfall during the wet season, while the Northeast Monsoon (NEM) causes relatively dry conditions as it passes over the Cordillera Mountains. Rainfall is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with the peak rainfall occurring from July to September. 

La Union is also affected by tropical cyclones, with 85 such weather systems recorded between 1948 and 2009, including one super typhoon. These storms, which occur most frequently from July to October, have adverse effects on tourism, agriculture, and infrastructure. During strong typhoons, businesses often close, power outages are common, transportation becomes limited, and crops suffer damage, reducing agricultural production.

===Administrative Divisions===
La Union comprises 19 municipalities and 1 component city, all of which are organized into two legislative districts. The First Congressional District consists of 8 municipalities and 1 city, while the Second Congressional District consists of 11 municipalities.



===Barangays===
La Union consists of &quot;576 barangays&quot;, which are spread across its &quot;19 municipalities&quot; and &quot;1 city&quot;. According to the 2020 census, the barangay with the highest population is &quot;Sevilla&quot;, located in the City of San Fernando, boasting a population of 11,316. When cities are not taken into account, Central East (Poblacion) in the municipality of Bauang ranks as the most populous barangay, with 4,249 residents. In contrast, &quot;Caggao&quot; in Bangar has the smallest population, totaling just 192 inhabitants.

==Demographics==

=== Population ===
According to the 2020 census conducted by the Philippine Census of Population and Housing, La Union had a population of 822,352, with a population density of 550 people per square kilometer (1,400 per square mile). This is an increase of 35,699 persons over the total population of 786,653 persons in 2015 Census of Population. The household population was nearly evenly distributed, with 50.6% male (414,860) and 49.4% female (405,480).
The City of San Fernando is the most populous area in La Union, with 125,640 residents (15.28% of the province&#x27;s total population), followed by Bauang (78,449), Agoo (66,028), Rosario (60,278), and Naguilian (52,189). Conversely, Burgos is the least populous municipality with 9,006 residents, followed by Santol (14,166), Bagulin (14,428), Sudipen (17,187), and San Gabriel (18,943).

Santol recorded the fastest population growth between 2015 and 2020, with an annual rate of 2.71%, followed by Burgos (2.34%), Tubao (2.13%), San Juan (1.81%), and Rosario (1.77%). In terms of population density, Agoo was the most densely populated municipality, with 1,250 persons per square kilometer, while Burgos had the lowest density at 127 persons per square kilometer.

Age distribution reveals that 26.3% of the population were young dependents (under 15 years), 66.1% were of working age (15–64 years), and 7.6% were elderly (65 years and older). Males slightly outnumbered females in younger age groups, while females were more numerous among the elderly, reflecting higher life expectancy for women. The overall sex ratio was 102 males per 100 females, with variations across age groups: 108 males per 100 females among those under 15, 105 in the working-age population, and 70 among the elderly.

The median age in La Union was 28.5 years. Senior citizens (60 years and older) comprised 11.5% of the population, 56.4% of whom were women. As of 2012, La Union had the longest life expectancy in the Philippines at 78.3 years.

=== Religion ===
According to the 2020 census on religious affiliation in the Ilocos Region, the majority of La Union&#x27;s household population identifies as Christian, with Roman Catholics comprising 69.5% (695,867 individuals). Iglesia ni Cristo represents a significant minority with 23,374 members, while Islam accounts for 0.19% of the population (1,932 adherents). Buddhism, though present in smaller numbers, constitutes 0.25% or 163 of the population.
In addition to Roman Catholicism and Iglesia ni Cristo, the province is home to a range of Christian denominations, including Protestantism, the Philippine Independent Church (Aglipayan), Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Pentecostal Church of God Asia Mission, Bible Baptist Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the Church of Christ, among others. Non-Christian religions such as Taoism and Hinduism are also practiced by a small portion of the population, reflecting the province’s cultural diversity and historical influences from trade and migration. 

=== Ethnicity ===
Historically, La Union has been home to several ethnolinguistic groups, including the Ilocanos, Pangasinan, and Cordillerans (Igorot). The Cordillerans primarily consist of the Ibaloi, Kankanaey, and the Bago, also known as Bago-Igorot. The Bago are a highland indigenous people referred to as new Christian converts during Spanish colonization in the province.

Ethically, La Union is predominantly Ilocano, according to a 2020 report by the Philippine Statistics Authority. The Ilocano ethnic group accounts for 673,312 or 81.88% of the population. In the southwestern part of the province, there are 10,319 Pangasinan people. Indigenous communities, including the Kankanaey (42,552), Bago (24,757), and Ibaloi (9,107), reside in the municipalities of Sudipen, Santol, San Gabriel, Bacnotan, Tubao, Pugo, Bagulin, and Burgos.

In Bagulin alone, 85% of the population, or 11,539 individuals, belong to indigenous groups. In Pugo, the majority of indigenous residents are from the Bago people. These communities have faced displacement, such as the eviction from the Mount Shontoug area in Pugo during the construction of the Marcos bust.

Other ethnic groups in La Union include 23,518 Tagalog people and 10,025 Bisaya or Binisaya people, 4,043 Bicolano people, 2,410 Kapampangan people, 2,383 Hiligaynon (Ilonggo) people, 2,311 Ifugao people, 1,717 Itneg (Tingguain) people, 1,586 Waray people, 1,319 Cebuano, 1,181 Maranao, people as well as foreign nationals such as 473 Chinese, 410 Indian, and 142 American, contributing to the province&#x27;s cultural diversity.

=== Language ===
Iloco, or Iloko, is the primary language spoken in La Union, with the Abagatan (Southern) dialect as its regional variation. In 2012, Iloco was officially recognized as the language of La Union through &quot;Provincial Ordinance No. 026-2012&quot;, known as the Iloco Code. Pangasinan is also spoken in the southern part of the province, particularly near the border with Pangasinan. Meanwhile, Kankanaey and Ibaloi are spoken by the Cordilleran communities residing in the highland areas of La Union.

Historically, in 1884, Governor Federico Francia issued an &quot;espediente&quot; (report) on the &quot;dialectos que hablan&quot; (dialects spoken) in La Union. The report noted that most &quot;umilis&quot; (townspeople) spoke Ilocano and Pangasinan, with Santo Tomas and Rosario being the only towns where both languages were spoken due to their proximity to Pangasinan. The remaining 11 towns predominantly spoke Iloco, excluding the scattered &quot;Igorrotes&quot; communities in &quot;rancherías&quot;. Up to the end of Hispanic rule, Ilocano remained the predominant lingua franca of La Union.

==Economy==

La Union’s economy is driven by three primary sectors: &quot;agriculture, industry&quot;, and &quot;services&quot;. The service sector plays a dominant role, comprising 81.28% of all business establishments, while industry contributes 17.21% and agriculture makes up 1.51%. In 2022, La Union emerged as the second fastest-growing economy in the Ilocos Region, with a growth rate of 7.7%. 

According to preliminary estimates from the 2019 Provincial Human Development Index by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), La Union scored 0.76, indicating a high level of development. The province’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2022 was valued at ₱118.60 billion, representing an 18.1% share of the region’s total economy. 

La Union ranked second in terms of per capita GDP, which was recorded at ₱140,840 and ₱124,580 over two different measures. However, the 2021 data from the PSA showed an increase in poverty incidence, with 13.90% of the population and 10.70% of families living below the poverty line, up from 5.20% and 3.70% in 2018, respectively.

=== Agriculture ===
Crop Production 

Agriculture, particularly crop production, remains vital to La Union&#x27;s economy and its city and municipalities. Major crops include rice (palay), corn, tobacco, sugarcane, root crops, legumes, fruits, and a variety of lowland and highland vegetables. 

In 2023, the province recorded a palay production volume of 173,891.55 metric tons, a 1.53% increase from the previous year&#x27;s production of 171,276.53 metric tons. The highest production levels in 2016 were in the towns of San Juan (9,941.36 metric tons), Naguilian (8,787.06 metric tons), Rosario (8,156.72 metric tons), Agoo (8,649.21 metric tons), and Bangar (7,701.41 metric tons).

For corn, La Union produced 25,197.17 metric tons in the first quarter of 2024, with a yield of 5.86 metric tons per hectare across 4,299.63 hectares. However, corn production decreased by 1.46% in the second quarter of 2024, due to a reduction in harvested area and yield per hectare.

In 2021, sugarcane production reached 2,073.64 metric tons. In terms of fruit farming, banana and mango are the most prevalent, while grapes, guapple, and dragon fruit are also cultivated, mainly in Bauang and Caba. The province also produces highland vegetables, with the towns of San Gabriel, Santol, Bagulin, and Burgos being the main producers of crops like cabbage, wombok, carrots, and cucumber.

La Union is of the top tobacco producer in the Philippines, particularly known for Virginia and native tobacco. In 2021, the province produced 4,606.88 metric tons of tobacco. Balaoan is the leading tobacco-producing town in the province, contributing the highest excise tax shares from Virginia tobacco production. Other contributing towns include Agoo, Bacnotan, Burgos, Caba, Luna, San Gabriel, Santo Tomas, San Juan, Pugo, Naguilian, Bauang, Bangar, Bagulin, and Aringay.

Fisheries and Aquaculture 

The province&#x27;s economy also heavily depends on its twelve coastal municipalities and fisheries. In the first quarter of 2024, municipal fisheries accounted for 75.27% of La Union&#x27;s total fisheries production, with 1,932.23 metric tons produced. Marine fisheries made up the bulk of this, contributing 1,814.97 metric tons (93.93%), while inland fisheries contributed 117.26 metric tons (6.07%). Key species include threadfin bream (&quot;bisugo&quot;), skipjack tuna (&quot;gulyasan&quot;), cavalla (&quot;talakitok&quot;), and Spanish mackerel (&quot;tanigue&quot;).

Aquaculture contributed 22.01% of the total fisheries production, amounting to 564.89 metric tons in the first quarter of 2024. The majority of aquaculture production came from milkfish (&quot;bangus&quot;), which totaled 481.33 metric tons, followed by oysters (43.56 metric tons) and tiger prawn (13.21 metric tons).

In 2022, the top five species produced in La Union were milkfish, grouper, tilapia, tiger prawn, and threadfin bream. Aquaculture farming is concentrated in the towns of Santo Tomas, Aringay, Bacnotan, the City of San Fernando, Luna, and Bangar. Seaweed (a&quot;rarosep&quot; or sea grapes) and sea urchin farming is also present in the province, mainly in Balaoan.

Commercial fisheries contributed 2.72% to total fisheries production, with 69.88 metric tons.

Animal Husbandry

In 2023, La Union&#x27;s livestock production reached 13,556 metric tons liveweight. Hog production was the largest contributor, while carabao production accounted for 7.57%, and cattle production for 14.73%. Goat production increased by 3.82%, totaling 904 metric tons liveweight.

Poultry production in 2023 reached 24,579 metric tons liveweight. Chicken production was the largest, with 1.35 million heads. However, chicken egg production decreased by 15.81%, and duck egg output dropped by 39.29%. The province also had an inventory of 1.35 million chickens, with 15.72 million chickens dressed. Quail farming is prominent in Pugo, where eggs and meat are commercially raised.

=== Industry ===

La Union’s economy is driven by agro-industries, cottage industries, and manufacturing sectors, which support the growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), serving as key drivers of economic growth in the province.

The province participates in the One Town, One Product (OTOP) initiative, promoting local products such as weaving (&quot;inabel&quot;) and blacksmithing (&quot;panday&quot;) in Bangar, sugarcane wine (&quot;basi&quot;) and vinegar (&quot;sukang Iloko&quot;) in Naguilian, rice wine (&quot;tapuy&quot;), and soft broom (&quot;buyboy&quot;) production using tiger grass in Bagulin and Burgos, honey (&quot;diro&quot;) production or apiculture in Bacnotan, fish paste (&quot;bugguong&quot;) and dried fish (&quot;daing&quot;) in Santo Tomas, salt farming in Balaoan, chichacorn (&quot;cornick&quot;) production in Tubao, and mushroom farming or fungiculture in Agoo.

Handicrafts also contribute to the local economy, with red clay pottery (&quot;damili&quot;) in San Juan, woodcarving and furnishing products in Pugo and Rosario, and rattan and bamboo basketry (&quot;laga&quot;) in Santol and Sudipen.

Manufacturing industries include Universal Leaf Corporation in Agoo, Holcim Cement, Inc. in Bacnotan, Pepsi Cola Plant in Rosario, Coca-Cola Plant in San Fernando City, B-Meg Satellite Plant in San Juan and Bacnotan, Amanianan Motors in Rosario, and Fortune Tobacco Corporation in Rosario. These industries provide significant employment opportunities and contribute to the economic stability of La Union by leveraging its local resources and products.

=== Service ===
The service sector is a vital driver of La Union’s economy, significantly contributing to the province’s development through trade, healthcare, education, commerce, transportation, and hospitality.

Transportation and Infrastructure

Transportation infrastructure, including the San Fernando International Seaport and San Fernando (Poro Point) Domestic Airport, plays a crucial role in facilitating economic activity.

<text>Luo Ben (c. 1330–1400, or c.1280–1360), better known by his courtesy name Guanzhong (), was a Chinese novelist who lived during the Ming dynasty. He is also known by his pseudonym Huhai Sanren (). Luo Guanzhong is credited with writing &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature.

==Identity==
The location and date of Luo Guanzhong&#x27;s birth are controversial. One possibility was that he was from Taiyuan, and lived in the late Yuan dynasty and early Ming dynasty by the record of his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), who said that he had met him in 1364. Another possibility was that he was born in Dongyuan, the province of Shandong, in about 1280 – 1360. Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including Hangzhou and Jiangnan.

According to Meng Fanren (孟繁仁), Luo Guanzhong can be identified in the pedigree of the Luo family, and Taiyuan is most likely his hometown. But, his name is not in this pedigree, and some people believe that pedigree of the Luo Family can&#x27;t prove that Luo Guanzhong is the author of Three Kingdoms. Some people doubt that If Luo Ben came from Taiyuan, why he had intimate knowledge of people&#x27;s lives in Shandong, and he had taken all his time and energy to write about them, and not about people in Taiyuan. Some people believe that the source of Taiyuan statement, which was written by Jia Zhongming (賈仲明), is most likely wrong in handwritten copy. According to recent research, there were two people named Luo Guanzhong during this time (陈辽，Chen Liao): one was a drama artist who came from Taiyuan, and the other was the author of the novel who came from Dongping.

Recent research has suggested that his date of birth was between 1315 and 1318. But other sources state it was nearer to 1330.

==Works==
The stories forming the bulk of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Water Margin&quot; are thought to have been developed by many independent storytellers. Shi Nai&#x27;an is thought to be the first to assemble &quot;Water Margin&quot; into a unified work, and Luo subsequently brought it to the current form of 100 chapters. Luo is usually considered the author of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

&quot;The Three Sui Quash the Demons&#x27; Revolt&quot; (平妖傳) is a shenmo fantasy story attributed to Luo with 20 chapters, developed from the original pieces of storytelling based on a rebellion at the end of the Northern Song, and later expanded by Feng Menglong (馮夢龍) into 40 chapters. &quot;Can Tang Wudai Shi Yanzhuan&quot; (殘唐五代史演義傳) is a chronicle of the end of the Tang dynasty and the following Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, a compilation of storytelling pieces based on the rebellion of Zhu Wen.

<text>Martin Bell, (born 31 August 1938) is a British UNICEF (UNICEF UK) Ambassador, a former broadcast war reporter and former independent politician who became the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tatton from 1997 to 2001. He is sometimes known as &quot;the man in the white suit&quot;.

==Background==
Bell is the son of author-farmer Adrian Bell, compiler of the first ever &quot;Times&quot; crossword. He is the brother of literary translator Anthea Bell (who died in 2018) and the uncle of Oliver Kamm, now a &quot;Times&quot; leader writer who served as his political adviser during his term as a Member of Parliament (MP).

His preparatory school was Taverham Hall School, just outside Norwich in Norfolk, and he was then educated at The Leys School in Cambridge. At King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, he achieved a first-class honours degree in English and served on the committee of Cambridge University Liberal Club, including a term as publicity officer. He failed to obtain a commission during his two-year national service and served out his time as an acting corporal in the Suffolk Regiment, serving in Cyprus during the Emergency.

==BBC correspondent==
Martin Bell joined the BBC as a reporter in Norwich in 1962. He moved to London three years later, beginning a distinguished career as a foreign affairs correspondent with his first assignment in Ghana. Over the next thirty years, he covered eleven conflicts and reported from eighty countries, making his name with reports from wars and conflicts in Vietnam, the Middle East, Nigeria, Angola, and in Northern Ireland (during &quot;The Troubles&quot;).

His roles at the BBC included diplomatic correspondent (1977–78), chief Washington correspondent (1978–89), and Berlin correspondent (1989–94).

He won the Royal Television Society&#x27;s Reporter of the Year award in 1977 and 1993 and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992. That same year, while covering the war in Bosnia, Bell was seriously wounded by shrapnel while recording a report in Sarajevo.

He remained an official BBC correspondent, although from the mid-1990s he filed relatively few reports, and became disillusioned with the corporation. He was unimpressed by the BBC&#x27;s introduction of a 24-hour news channel (BBC News 24) and what he described as the increasing &quot;Murdochisation&quot; of BBC News.

==Independent politician==

On 7 April 1997, twenty-four days before that year&#x27;s British general election, Bell announced that he was leaving the BBC to stand as an independent candidate in the Tatton constituency in Cheshire. Tatton was one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, where the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament, Neil Hamilton, was embroiled in sleaze allegations. Labour and the Liberal Democrats withdrew their candidates in Bell&#x27;s favour in a plan masterminded by Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair&#x27;s press secretary.

On 1 May 1997, Hamilton was trounced, and Bell was elected an MP with a majority of 11,077 votes – overturning a notional Conservative majority of over 22,000 in the 4th safest Conservative seat in the UK – and thus became the first successful independent parliamentary candidate since 1951.

When Bell spoke in the House of Commons, it was mostly on local issues or matters of British policy in the former Yugoslavia and the Third World. Although Bell voted with the Labour government of Tony Blair on many issues, he voted with the Conservatives in opposing the repeal of Section 28. He also voted against the banning of fox hunting. On 12 November 1997 he was cheered from the Conservative benches when he asked Blair about the Bernie Ecclestone affair, &quot;Does the Prime Minister agree that the perception of wrongdoing can be as damaging to public confidence as the wrongdoing itself? Have we slain one dragon only to have another take its place, with a red rose in its mouth?&quot;

Bell described being an independent politician in Parliament as a &quot;fortunate position&quot; as he did not have to compromise for party interests, however he acknowledged it is a &quot;necessary evil&quot; for why compromises had to be made between politicians&#x27; principles and the end policy outputs.

As part of his election platform, Bell had stated that he would serve for only one term, his specific purpose being to oppose Neil Hamilton. Bell said that the only thing which could make him change his mind would be Hamilton being selected by the Tatton Conservative Party as a candidate for the next general election. However, George Osborne (a future Chancellor of the Exchequer) was selected in March 1999 as the Conservative Party candidate for Tatton. Hamilton lost his libel case against Mohamed Al-Fayed in December 1999, ending any prospect of his making an immediate political comeback. Though he regretted making the pledge of saying he would serve for only one term, Bell stuck to his promise.

In 2001, Bell stood as an independent candidate against another Conservative MP, Eric Pickles, in the &quot;safe&quot; Essex constituency of Brentwood and Ongar, where there were accusations that the local Conservative Association had been infiltrated by a Pentecostal church. In this election, Labour and the Liberal Democrats did not stand aside for him. Bell came second and reduced the Conservative majority from 9,690 to 2,821.

Having garnered nearly 32% of the votes and second place, Bell announced his retirement from politics, saying that &quot;winning one and losing one is not a bad record for an amateur&quot;.

The Channel 4 drama &quot;Mr White Goes to Westminster&quot; was loosely based on Bell&#x27;s political career.

==Post-political life==

Bell was appointed UNICEF UK Ambassador for Humanitarian Emergencies in August 2001, to work to improve the plight of children affected by conflict and natural disasters.

He made a brief return to television news in 2003 when he provided analysis of the Iraq invasion for ITN&#x27;s Channel Five News. He compiled films from the daily video footage and drew on his experience to comment upon this material.

Bell reversed his previous decision and stood for the European Parliament in the June 2004 elections, but was ultimately unsuccessful as an independent candidate in the East of England region, winning only 6.2% of the vote.

Before the 2005 general election he became affiliated with the Independent Network to help promote independent candidates (its most prominent candidate being Reg Keys who fought against prime minister Tony Blair in the Sedgefield constituency).

In April 2006, Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate whether any law had been broken in the Cash for Peerages scandal. Bell wrote jointly with MacNeil to Prime Minister Tony Blair calling for all appointments to the House of Lords to be suspended.

In May 2009, he came out in support of the Green Party in the weeks before the 2009 European Parliament election, supporting the Green Party&#x27;s &#x27;Clean Campaigning&#x27; pledge in the wake of the scandal over MPs&#x27; expenses.

On 21 May 2009, he appeared on the special live edition of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; which was held in Salisbury in the midst of the political scandal surrounding MPs&#x27; expenses.

He announced that he was considering standing against a third Conservative MP, Sir Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, at the 2010 general election, but following Winterton&#x27;s announcement that he was not going to seek re-election, did not do so. He indicated that he might stand against Hazel Blears in Salford (the first sitting MP of a party other than the Conservative Party against whom he expressed an interest in standing) although in the end he did not stand in any constituency.

In November 2018, Bell fell at Gatwick Airport and required major maxillo-facial surgery at St George&#x27;s Hospital to rebuild his face. He praised surgeon Helen Witherow, saying &quot;this lady is an absolutely brilliant surgeon, and I think sometimes the NHS can use a bit of good publicity&quot;.

In November 2021, Bell was approached by the Liberal Democrats to run in the 2021 North Shropshire by-election after the resignation of the Tory MP Owen Paterson after a lobbying scandal, but declined to stand.

==Personal life==
Bell has been married four times. He has two daughters with his first wife, Helene Gordoun, a Frenchwoman whom he left for the American television journalist Rebecca Sobel during his time in Washington. He commented that the marriage was &quot;a disaster&quot;, and it later emerged that his stepdaughter, Jessica Sobel, had become a drug addict, prostitute and porn star.

<text>Ottmar Mergenthaler (11 May 1854 – 28 October 1899) was a German-American inventor who invented the linotype machine, the first device that could easily and quickly set complete lines of type for use in printing presses. This machine revolutionized the art of printing.

== Life and career ==
Mergenthaler was born into a German family in Hachtel, Kingdom of Württemberg. He was the third son of a school teacher, Johann Georg Mergenthaler, from Hohenacker near the city of Waiblingen.

He was apprenticed to a watchmaker in Bietigheim before emigrating to the United States in 1872 to work with his cousin August Hahl in Washington, D.C. Mergenthaler eventually moved with Hahl&#x27;s shop to Baltimore, Maryland. In 1878, Mergenthaler became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1881, Mergenthaler became Hahl&#x27;s business partner.

=== Invention of the Linotype ===
In 1876, Mergenthaler was approached by James O. Clephane and his associate Charles T. Moore, who sought a quicker way of publishing legal briefs. By 1884 he conceived the idea of assembling metallic letter molds, called &quot;matrices&quot;, and casting molten metal into them, all within a single machine. His first attempt proved the idea feasible, and a new company was formed. Always improving his invention, Mergenthaler further developed his idea of an independent matrix machine.

In July 1886, the first commercially used Linotype was installed in the printing office of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;. Here it was immediately used on the daily paper and a large book. The book, the first ever composed with the new Linotype method, was titled, &quot;The Tribune Book of Open-Air Sports&quot;. Produced by his Mergenthaler Linotype Company, the machine remained a mainstay of the publishing industry until the 1980s.

=== Death ===

Mergenthaler died of tuberculosis in Baltimore in 1899.

== Legacy ==

An operational Linotype machine is on display at the Baltimore Museum of Industry, in the museum&#x27;s print shop. Baltimore&#x27;s vocational high school, Mergenthaler Vocational Technical Senior High School, which opened in 1953, is named after him, although it is commonly referred to simply as &quot;MERVO&quot;.

Mergenthaler Hall on the Homewood Campus of the Johns Hopkins University was constructed in 1940–41 with donations by Mergenthaler&#x27;s widow and by his son Eugene.
Mergenthaler is depicted in Edward Laning&#x27;s mural &quot;The Story of the Recorded Word&quot; on the east wall of the McGraw Rotunda at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. Mergenthaler is shown in the mural alongside his linotype machine and Whitelaw Reid of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;.
