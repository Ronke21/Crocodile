<text>Robert John Arthur Halford (born 25 August 1951) is an English heavy metal singer. He is best known as the lead vocalist of Judas Priest, which was formed in 1969 and has received accolades such as the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance. He has been noted for his powerful and wide ranging operatic vocal style and trademark leather-and-studs image, both of which have become iconic in heavy metal. He has also been involved with several side projects, including Fight, Two, and Halford.

Halford is often regarded as one of the greatest metal frontmen and singers of all time. AllMusic said of Halford, &quot;There have been few vocalists in the history of heavy metal whose singing style has been as influential and instantly recognizable... able to effortlessly alternate between a throaty growl and an ear-splitting falsetto.&quot; He was ranked at No. 33 on the list of greatest voices in rock by Planet Rock listeners in 2009. He has also been nicknamed &quot;Metal God&quot; by fans. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Judas Priest in 2022, via the Award for Musical Excellence.

==Career==
===Early years===
Robert John Arthur Halford was born on 25 August 1951 in Sutton Coldfield. He grew up in nearby Walsall, where he was raised on the Beechdale housing estate; the estate was also home to Noddy Holder.

===Judas Priest===


Halford was introduced to Judas Priest bassist and co-founder Ian Hill by his sister Sue, who was dating Hill at the time. Halford, a manager of a men&#x27;s clothing store, joined the band as singer, bringing with him drummer John Hinch from his previous band Hiroshima. Halford and Hinch played their first show with Judas Priest in May 1973 at the Townhouse in Wellington, Shropshire. The show was recorded and part of it released in 2019 on the compilation &quot;Downer-Rock Asylum&quot; on the Audio Archives label.

In 1974, he made his recording debut on the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot;. He continued to front Judas Priest throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990, Halford emerged with all-new tattoos, including a bent Judas Priest cross on his right arm and ring around his other, as well as a few on his shoulders. He also began shaving his head.

On the last date of the tour for &quot;Painkiller&quot; in August 1991 at a show in Toronto, Halford rode onstage on a large Harley-Davidson motorcycle, dressed in motorcycle leathers, as part of the show. The stage riser malfunctioned and he collided with a half-raised drum riser and fell off it, breaking his nose in the process. He was left unconscious for a short time while the band was performing the first song. After regaining consciousness, Halford returned and finished the show. Halford had been wanting to do a solo project and had the blessing of his band members to do so. A studio executive told him he would have to technically &#x27;resign&#x27; from Judas Priest to do so and he wrote a statement citing his interest in a solo project. The letter was leaked and taken out of context in that he was quitting the band. Due to personal challenges with conflict, he was unable to clarify what happened and it was over ten years before he reconnected with the band and rejoined.

===Fight===
Shortly after Halford&#x27;s departure, he formed the band Fight with Judas Priest drummer Scott Travis, bassist Jack &quot;Jay Jay&quot; Brown and guitarists Brian Tilse and Russ Parrish. The first album &quot;War of Words&quot; was released in 1993, followed by the half live, half remixes EP &quot;Mutations&quot; in 1994. A tour took place in support of the album in 1994. The second album &quot;A Small Deadly Space&quot; was released in 1995, with a tour taking place in support of that album as well. While &quot;War of Words&quot; was a straightforward metal record, &quot;A Small Deadly Space&quot; had a grungier sound, making it less appealing to fans who had developed a taste for &quot;War of Words&quot;. As the band were preparing to begin work on the third album, they split up, thus ending their business with their label Epic Records. A brief reunion with half of the original members took place on 20 December 1997 for a one-off performance before disbanding once again. In a 2015 interview, Halford contemplated Fight&#x27;s reformation.

===2wo===
In 1997, Halford collaborated with guitarist John Lowery to form an industrial-influenced band called 2wo. They released their only album &quot;Voyeurs&quot; in 1998, which was produced by Dave Ogilvie and released on Trent Reznors Nothing Records label.

===Halford===
In 1999, Halford returned to his metal roots and formed a solo band. The album &quot;Resurrection&quot; was released in 2000 to critical acclaim. The band embarked on a tour with Iron Maiden and Queensrÿche to support the album. A live album titled &quot;Live Insurrrection&quot; was released in 2001. It was followed up by the second album &quot;Crucible&quot; in 2002. In 2010, Halford released a live DVD titled &quot;Live in Anaheim&quot; and the fourth studio album &quot;Halford IV: Made of Metal&quot;.

===Reunion with Judas Priest===

Halford&#x27;s reunion with Judas Priest came about from years of speculation about when he was no longer in the line-up, at least since the release of the &quot;Resurrection&quot; album, which some critics claimed sounded more like Judas Priest than the band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Jugulator&quot; (1997). Halford initially ruled it out, but then reconsidered, stating in 2002 that &quot;Gut instinct tells me that at some point it will happen&quot;.

In July 2003, Halford returned to Judas Priest and embarked on a tour in 2004 in celebration of his return. The band released &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot; in 2005. A world tour accompanied the release and marked the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. In 2008, &quot;Nostradamus&quot; was released.

In 2011, Judas Priest embarked upon what was billed as their final world tour as a group, titled the &quot;Epitaph&quot; tour. Subsequent to the tour&#x27;s announcement, Halford stated that he would continue to move forward with his solo band.

Despite the &quot;final tour&quot; announcement in 2011, Halford and Judas Priest (minus K. K. Downing, who left the group prior to the Epitaph tour) recorded another album, &quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot;, which was released in 2014, the album supported by a concert tour.

In 2017, Judas Priest began to work on another studio album with Halford. The album &quot;Firepower&quot; was released 9 March 2018.

===Live appearances===

Halford performed as the vocalist for Black Sabbath for three shows. He replaced Ronnie James Dio for two nights in November 1992, when Dio elected not to open a show for Ozzy Osbourne. Halford also filled in for Osbourne in Black Sabbath on 26 August 2004 (one day after Halford&#x27;s 53rd birthday) at an Ozzfest show in Camden, New Jersey, since Osbourne could not perform due to bronchitis.

Halford joined Sum 41 on stage in 2001 for a televised concert for MTV&#x27;s 20th anniversary with drummer Tommy Lee to perform &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin&#x27;&quot; as the final song of a medley.

Halford joined Metallica on stage three times where they performed the song &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;; in 1994 on the last date of the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour, in 2011 at The Fillmore for the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebration and in 2013 at the fifth annual Revolver Golden Gods awards in Los Angeles.

Halford joined Pantera on stage twice. The first performance was in 1992 where he sang on the songs &quot;Metal Gods&quot; and &quot;Grinder&quot;, and again in 1997 where he sang on &quot;Grinder&quot;.

Halford joined queercore band Pansy Division on stage in July 1997 to perform the song &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;.

Halford joined Babymetal on stage on 18 July 2016 at the Alternative Press Music Awards in Cleveland where they performed a medley of &quot;Painkiller&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Law&quot;.

===Other activities===
Halford made an appearance in the 2002 film &quot;Spun&quot; where he played a retail clerk at a sex shop.

In 2006, Halford split with Sanctuary Records and founded Metal God Entertainment to produce and licence any future material. All Fight and Halford material were released in remastered format, which also includes DVDs from both bands.

Halford provided voice-over for the characters General Lionwhyte and the leader of the Fire Barons on the 2009 video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;. The Baron&#x27;s appearance and personality are based on Halford.

Halford developed the clothing line Metal God Apparel with plans to develop retail sales through 2010.

Halford had a brief cameo in a 2010 commercial for Virgin Mobile, where he appeared as a priest.

In 2019, Halford was working on an autobiography. The autobiography, titled &quot;Confess&quot;, was originally announced to be published in October 2020, but received its official date for 29 September 2020 via Hachette Books. In August 2020, Halford confirmed that he had completed an audiobook version of the publication, to be made available at the same time as the physical release.

Halford has appeared as himself, representing the character Kevin&#x27;s conscience, in the 2022 American teen comedy-drama &quot;Metal Lords&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Hobbies===
Halford divides his time between homes in the United States and his home town of Walsall.

Halford owns a 1970s Aston Martin DBS, a Chevrolet Corvette, and a Mercury Cougar. He did not get a driving licence until the age of 38. In 2010, he said that his main car was a 2006 Cadillac DTS.

In May 2021, Halford was made a Kentucky Colonel by Governor Andy Beshear.

===Sexuality===
Halford is gay. He publicly revealed his homosexuality on MTV in 1998. He broke down in tears saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful moment when you walk out of the closet. Now I&#x27;ve done that and I&#x27;ve freed myself. It&#x27;s a great feeling for me to finally let go and make this statement—especially to &quot;The Advocate&quot;, because this magazine has brought me so much comfort over the years. Obviously this is just a wonderful day for me.&quot; Halford later explained that he did not have a plan or an agenda when coming in to do his interview with MTV. He mainly spoke about and promoted the &quot;Voyeurs&quot; album he made with guitarist John 5, when he slipped out his sexuality after being asked a question from the studio&#x27;s producer. He cited it being &quot;kind of a big leap forward&quot;.

At the time Halford revealed his sexuality, he was concerned that he would lose his fanbase as a result. He explained that he cannot return to certain places of the world in fear of stoning. He described the 1970s and 1980s as &quot;incredibly difficult&quot;, but not counting it as important music-wise. Halford jokingly claimed that he cannot be replaced by a straight man, bringing up late Queen vocalist Freddie Mercury, saying that &quot;if Freddie hadn&#x27;t have been gay, Queen would&#x27;ve been a totally different band. But that&#x27;s a really important part of my life that I have to get down on paper at some point.&quot;

Halford describes himself as &quot;the stately homo of heavy metal&quot;, and said that his announcement was &quot;the greatest thing I could have done for myself&quot;. He also explained that he did not announce it sooner due to the fear that it was going to be troublesome for him.

Halford speaks negatively about the discrimination homosexuals still face in some parts of the world. He recalled that his announcement came as a surprise, and questioned if he would have told the members of Judas Priest while he was in the band. Halford said that after he completed his interview, he began to fear negative reactions, but was quickly inundated with messages of support from colleagues and fans.

In 2018, Halford stated that society has not changed as much as he hoped since his announcement: &quot;You&#x27;d think there would have been some kind of change and people would have moved on after such a long time. Now that I&#x27;m moving through my OAP heavy metal years (laughs), I thought a lot of it would be gone by now. And it&#x27;s a shame. We don&#x27;t really get to spend a lot of time on this planet together, so there&#x27;s no point in wasting it being divided.&quot;

The subject matter of his lyrics had not changed since his coming out, and he avoided addressing it in Judas Priest&#x27;s lyrics. However, the song &quot;Raw Deal&quot; from the 1977 album &quot;Sin After Sin&quot; speaks about Fire Island in New York, which was famous in the 1970s and 1980s as a community for gay men. He felt that the lyrics were &quot;just too much&quot;, but was approved by the other members of the band. &quot;But you listen to that song, it really is almost like a coming-out experience for me. And it never really registered. It&#x27;s only been in recent years that people have picked up on that song,&quot; he said.

In September 2020, Halford revealed how in 1992 he had a &quot;George Michael moment&quot; when he was arrested for public indecency in a men&#x27;s bathroom commonly used for casual sex in Venice Beach, California. An officer who was a fan of Judas Priest helped keep the arrest from wide publicity.

He is currently married to his husband Thomas.

Halford has previously spoken about the level of acceptance of his sexuality within the metal community, calling it accepting and inclusive.

===Health===
In the &quot;Behind the Music&quot; documentary series, Halford said that hiding his sexuality during Judas Priest&#x27;s career caused him a lot of depression and isolation which led to his alcohol and drug abuse.

During the making of the band&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Turbo&quot;, Halford struggled with increasing substance abuse and violent feuds with his romantic partner. The singer entered rehab in January 1986 following a painkiller overdose and even managed to stay sober after his partner died by suicide. He says that he has been clean and sober since then. He made an energetic recovery and his live performances during the subsequent Fuel for Life Tour were described as some of his strongest ever.

He was born and raised in a Christian household, and said that his upbringing &quot;has become more important since I became clean and sober on 6 January 1986. That was 25 years ago and I think that&#x27;s probably more important to me now, on a daily basis.&quot;

When asked in 2016 what part sobriety has played in the band&#x27;s longevity, he responded, &quot;Without it? Oh, I&#x27;d be dead. Literally, I would be dead.&quot;

Despite being clean and sober since 1986, he confessed that he did have the desire to &quot;have a drink&quot; and &quot;have a smoke and do a line. I wish I could do all that, but I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve done all that. I&#x27;ve done all that and it nearly killed me. I wish I could do that because when I&#x27;m with my friends and they&#x27;re having a good time and there&#x27;s this little devil on your shoulder, &#x27;Just have a quick shot. Do a shot of Jack. He pointed out to those who are recovering from their abuse about dealing with the &quot;little devil on your shoulder or the monkey on your back&quot;, and that being clean and sober was &quot;the greatest gift I was given. It was a gift. I can&#x27;t do this by myself. There&#x27;s another source helping. That&#x27;s just a thrill to share with the music at this point.&quot;

Halford underwent back surgery in 2013 and umbilical hernia surgery in 2014.

Halford battled prostate cancer during the COVID-19 lockdowns after experiencing symptoms in 2017. He underwent prostatectomy in July 2020. After more cancer was found, he went through radiation treatments in April and May that year and was cleared in June before travelling to England to visit family. He also had an appendectomy after a tumour was discovered in his appendix.

==Singing style and influences==

Halford possesses a powerful voice with a wide vocal range which is marked by his high-pitched screams and strong vibrato. Along with Ronnie James Dio and Bruce Dickinson, Halford is one of the pioneers of the operatic vocal style later to be adopted by power metal vocalists and regularly appears near the top in lists of the greatest metal vocalists/front-men of all time. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Halford at number 129 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Halford describes himself as &quot;a huge Queen fan&quot; since they began and saw their very early shows. He has called Freddie Mercury, the late lead singer of the band, his &quot;ultimate hero&quot; and expressed regret that he never got to know him.

As a vocalist, Halford was influenced by Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin and Robert Plant. He was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Cream, David Bowie, King Crimson, the Rolling Stones, John Mayall, and Alice Cooper.

<text>Peter James Stringfellow (17 October 1940 – 7 June 2018) was an English businessman who owned several nightclubs.

==Early life==
Stringfellow was born in the City General Hospital, Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 17 October 1940, to Elsie Bowers and James William Stringfellow, a steelworker who served in the Royal Scots Greys during the Second World War. He was the eldest of four, having three younger brothers; Geoffrey, Paul and Terry.

The family lived in Andover Street, Pitsmoor, Sheffield, until 1948 when they had moved to Marshall Street, Pitsmoor. Peter Stringfellow attended Pye Bank Church of England Primary School. He failed his 11 plus and so attended Burngreave Secondary School for one year. He then passed the exam for Sheffield Central Technical College and he left three years later at the age of 15 with a 4th grade Technical Diploma.

==Career==
When Stringfellow was 13 years old, he worked at a cinema on The Wicker arterial street in Sheffield. His first job after leaving school was as an assistant tie salesman at Austin Reed. After some casual jobs he enrolled as an apprentice in the Merchant Navy, at the age of 16. His Merchant Navy career lasted two years.

On his return to Sheffield, he worked briefly in various jobs. While at Dobson&#x27;s Furnishings Company he was convicted of selling stolen carpets and served two weeks in Armley Prison, Leeds, in June 1962 and six weeks in Ford Open Prison.

After his conviction and imprisonment he was unable to find regular work. This led to his business career running clubs.

===Nightclub management===
In 1962, Stringfellow rented St Aidan&#x27;s Church Hall in Sheffield every Friday night, operating the Black Cat Club. Several bands played in the club, such as the Pursuers, Dave Berry and the Cruisers, Johnny Tempest and the Cadillacs and from London, Screaming Lord Sutch, the Savages, Count Lindsay and Gene Vincent.

His fortunes changed when The Beatles played on 2 April 1963. The demand for concert tickets was so great that Stringfellow rented a larger venue, the Azena Ballroom in Sheffield. On that night he sent the Beatles a telegram congratulating them on their first album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;.

In 1963, Stringfellow began another club, the Blue Moon, at St. John&#x27;s Church Hall in Sheffield. The opening act was the Marauders who had a single, &quot;That&#x27;s What I Want&quot;, in the British top 50. More bands followed such as the Kinks. Other bands that played at the club and who later became famous were Freddie Starr and the Midnighters, the Searchers, Shane Fenton and the Fentones, Wayne Fontana, Long John Baldry and the Hoochie Coochie Men, Rod Stewart and the Soul Agents, Vance Arnold &amp; The Avengers, Dean Marshall and the Deputies.

In 1964, Stringfellow opened the highly successful Mojo Club, later renamed the King Mojo Club in Sheffield. During its three and half years of business, many bands played at the club, including the Who, Pink Floyd, the Brian Auger Trinity, the Graham Bond Organisation, John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers, the Yardbirds, Zoot Money&#x27;s Big Roll Band, the Hollies, the Merseybeats, the Spencer Davis Group, the Pretty Things, Manfred Mann, the Small Faces, Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, and the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Other American acts who played in the club included the first Tamla/Motown acts to play in the UK, Ben E. King, Sonny Boy Williamson, Tina Turner, Inez and Charlie Foxx, John Lee Hooker, and Little Stevie Wonder.

In 1968, he went into another business venture with Down Broadway, just under the Stylo&#x27;s shoe shop in the centre of Sheffield.

On 4 November 1968, Jethro Tull was the first act to play at Down Broadway and John Peel was booked to play as the star DJ. Another progressive rock group, Yes, also played at the club. In 1969, Stringfellow acquired the first alcohol licence for another of his clubs called the Penthouse Sheffield. The club only lasted for a year due to trouble with overcrowding and objections from the local police. This prompted him to sell it and move to Leeds.

In 1970, he opened Cinderella&#x27;s in Leeds. This was Stringfellow&#x27;s first super club, mixing recorded music and live bands.

In 1972, Stringfellow acquired a space next door to Cinderella&#x27;s to create another club called Rockafella&#x27;s. This was the first and last of his super cabaret and super clubs. Comedy duo Mike and Bernie Winters and magician Paul Daniels performed at the club. The two clubs were combined in 1973 and given the name Cinderella Rockafella&#x27;s, and Stringfellow dropped the cabaret and put in full-time DJs such as Chris Crossley and Peter Tyler. He and his brother, Paul Stringfellow, also served as DJs.

In 1976, Stringfellow and his then business partner and brother, Geoffrey Stringfellow, sold the Cinderella Rockafella&#x27;s to Mecca and moved to Manchester, where they opened the Millionaire Club. There were no live bands in the Millionaire Club. However, the Stringfellows hired named DJs including Peter Tyler and Brett Sinclair.

In 1980, he sold the Millionaire Club to Granada Ltd and he then moved with his whole family to London. There he opened Stringfellows Covent Garden. It was an immediate success as a nightclub in London, where celebrities, international film stars, TV personalities, rock stars, models, paparazzi and national newspaper journalists partied for the next 15 years.

In 1983, he took over the old cabaret club, Talk of the Town, which had closed. He reopened it with its original name Hippodrome and it became the &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Disco&quot;. The Hippodrome introduced its first gay night at the venue under his management. He also started Hippodrome Records and one of his acts to sign was Dusty Springfield who released the single, &quot;Sometimes Like Butterflies&quot;.

In 1986, he opened Stringfellow&#x27;s New York, which was frequented by New York celebrities and managed with his daughter Karen. In 1989, he opened Stringfellow&#x27;s Miami, and then Stringfellow&#x27;s Los Angeles in 1990. He sustained huge financial losses due to the American economic recession in 1989.

In 1996, Stringfellow&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;King of Clubs&quot;, was published by Little, Brown. It was serialised in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; newspaper and became a best-seller.

====Adult clubbing====
In 1990, Stringfellow introduced table dancing to his New York club with a licensing deal with Michael J. Peter. This became Stringfellow&#x27;s Presents Pure Platinum. In 1996, Cabaret of Angels, a table-side dancing club was opened for three nights a week at Stringfellow&#x27;s Covent Garden.

In 2006, Stringfellow opened his second adult entertainment club named Angels in Wardour Street, Soho. He was the first club owner to gain a fully nude licence from Westminster City Council. In 2009, he criticised the Policing and Crime Act 2009, saying the licensing changes with regards to lap dancing were &quot;unnecessary&quot; and he would be appealing to the European Court of Human Rights if his current licences were not renewed.

In 2012, he was granted the necessary sexual entertainment venue (SEV) Licence for Stringfellow&#x27;s Covent Garden and Angels Soho, and was able to successfully market Angels as providing rooms for the entertainment &quot;in privacy&quot; of young women in lingerie.

==Television==
Stringfellow first appeared on television as a warm-up act on &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; in 1964. He contributed to numerous programmes, both radio and television, in subsequent decades. Stringfellow appeared on &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot; where he was gunged alongside Jimmy Savile. He appeared on the celebrity edition of &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;, with the first broadcast on 17 September 2008. Stringfellow appeared in season 1, episode 2 on &quot;Trigger Happy TV&quot;. He also appeared in season 15 episode 1 of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, which was broadcast on 27 June 2010, where he had to help Jeremy Clarkson when he was stuck in a rolled over Reliant Robin.

==Personal life==
Stringfellow married Norma Williams in 1960. They had a daughter, Karen, who was involved with Stringfellow&#x27;s businesses for many years and is now a boutique owner in Florida. After Stringfellow and Williams divorced, he married Coral Wright in 1967. They had one son together before divorcing: Scott, a former racecar driver. He had a 12-year relationship with Frizzby Fox, which ended in 1996, and then for two years until 1998 with Helen Benoist. Stringfellow married Bella Wright in 2009. They had a daughter, Rosabella, in 2013 and a son, Angelo, in 2015.

Stringfellow had four grandchildren: Taylor, Jaime, Thomas and Teddy.

Stringfellow lived in Gerrards Cross, Cheadle Hulme and in Mallorca.

Stringfellow was a donor to the Conservative Party and supported a UKIP candidate in 2012, but he publicly disavowed the Conservative Party in 2018 over Brexit, stating that the &quot;price is too high&quot;. He said he would support the Liberal Democrats if the Conservatives&#x27; advocacy of leaving the European Union continued.

Stringfellow was treated for lung cancer in 2008, but was healthy until he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in late 2017. He died on 7 June 2018 at the age of 77, at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital in London.

<doc id="262462" wikidata="Q355397" url="?curid=262462" title="K. K. Downing">
<text>Kenneth Downing Jr. (born 27 October 1951) is an English guitarist and a founding member of the heavy metal bands Judas Priest and KK&#x27;s Priest.

== Early life and career ==
Downing was born in West Bromwich, West Midlands. In the late 1960s, he developed a passion for rock music and the guitar, which led to his being kicked out of his home at age 15 and dropping out of school soon afterwards. He is a mostly self-taught guitarist. He was heavily influenced by Jimi Hendrix, whom Downing said he was &quot;very quick to recognize&quot; as the future. He was also influenced by John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers and Eric Clapton.

Downing started his first band, a pop band called Stagecoach, between the age of 17 and 18 with his second cousin Brian Badhams on bass guitar (now with The Elkie Brooks Band) and drummer Martin Phillips. The trio &quot;mainly jammed a few Cream songs and a few 12-bar blues&quot;. Downing played guitar with the band after winning a coin toss with Badhams &quot;in his bedroom to see who would play guitar or bass&quot;. K. K. Downing attended catering college and worked as trainee chef at the Lyttelton Arms in Hagley.

Downing is the cousin of football coach Keith Downing.

== Playing style and technique ==

Downing has an aggressive, rock-influenced guitar style featuring solos and dual leads with fellow Judas Priest guitarist Glenn Tipton.

== Leaving Judas Priest ==

Downing officially left Judas Priest on 20 April 2011, citing &quot;an on-going breakdown in working relationships between myself, elements of the band and management for some time.&quot; He stated that there were at least &quot;21 reasons&quot; why he left, but refused to go into specific detail; however, he did express disappointment in the band&#x27;s live performance and thought it could have been better. Judas Priest had since continued with Richie Faulkner as his replacement.

Soon after Glenn Tipton announced his Parkinson&#x27;s disease diagnosis and his self-imposed retirement from touring in February 2018, Downing said that he was &quot;shocked and stunned&quot; that he wasn&#x27;t approached to rejoin Judas Priest and was &quot;officially and legally still a member of Judas Priest&quot;, despite not being present in the band. He felt that he made the right choice to leave when he did and that his time in the band and value in terms of crafting their legacy &quot;was and is unappreciated by more than one member&quot;. He said that the decision of not being approached &quot;was not a financial one&quot;. Faulkner and Halford spoke in regards to his statement. Bassist Ian Hill explained why he wasn&#x27;t contacted to rejoin Judas Priest and the potential conflicts that would occur if he was brought back in the band. Downing spoke negatively towards Hill&#x27;s comments.

Downing explained why he left Judas Priest, expressed his concerns towards his former bandmates, and his feelings about Faulkner. Faulkner spoke in regards to Downing&#x27;s comments, with former Judas Priest vocalist Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens speaking in Downing&#x27;s defense. In the limelight of Downing&#x27;s comments, Hill said that Downing and the band have &quot;parted company&quot; musically, explaining that he had not been in contact with him &quot;for the last couple of years because we&#x27;ve been so busy. But I think, musically, we&#x27;ve parted ways, really. Probably the less said, the better.&quot;

Halford said that Downing spoke for himself and said that he wanted to retire and wished him well on his future endeavours. Downing recalled the conflicts that occurred in the winter of 2010, and would then reconsider his departure a few months later, which is not mentioned in his autobiography. After speaking to bassist Ian Hill about the change, he received the setlist for the dubbed farewell tour, only to find out that his announcement to retire from the band was made public the next day, prompting him to send in his angry second letter. Downing felt that he never left Judas Priest and was orchestrated for him to not be there.

Downing stated that he never retired from the music industry, detailing about being encouraged to perform on the farewell tour by a friend and being ridiculed by the fans about his announcement. After guitarist Glenn Tipton&#x27;s dismissal from touring, Downing expected an opening for him to return, but was never notified. He said essentially the band is performing his songs and that if they can call themselves &quot;Priest&quot;, he felt the need to be a Priest as well and be able to perform his songs. Downing recalled being frustrated and having a breakdown at the end of 2010, leading him to quit the band. He said that he wasn&#x27;t ready to perform on the farewell tour due to his issues that occurred during the Metal Masters Tour, saying that the band wasn&#x27;t tight and felt that they weren&#x27;t the same band as they were in their prime. He regretted sending in the retirement letter and not believing anything he wrote. He cited the second letter, telling the band to ignore everything written and explaining the reasons why he left, but the band preferred to tell the content of the first letter instead, in which he told the band to ignore what he wrote as misinformation.

When speaking about the difference on working with Tipton in Judas Priest to working with guitarist A.J. Mills in his band KK&#x27;s Priest, Downing said that he felt that he didn&#x27;t have as fair a share of the lead work in Judas Priest as he should have.

=== Future ===
Downing&#x27;s relationship with Judas Priest is not &quot;overly sweet at the moment. Nothing lasts forever. I started in the late &#x27;60s, so certainly guys from that time, we&#x27;re not going to be around forever. Obviously, we&#x27;re losing a lot of good friends along the way. It is the way it is.&quot; An opportunity existed for him to return to the band, &quot;and that has passed on.&quot; He expressed uncertainty if there would ever be another opportunity for him to rejoin, but did not dismiss it in the future.

Downing explained that if he didn&#x27;t rejoin Judas Priest, &quot;then maybe it&#x27;s best to just leave it there, really&quot;, feeling that there would be a different occupation for him, &quot;Exactly what I don&#x27;t know, really.&quot; Hill said that there were no plans for him to return in the foreseeable future. Downing had an open interest in having a discussion with his former bandmates in taking part in the band&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration in 2020, but was not contacted, expressing doubt that he ever would rejoin Judas Priest again.

Downing hoped to make amends with his former bandmates, &quot;But it&#x27;s proved not to be the case, so, obviously, I have to accept that and just move forward.&quot; He clarified his comment from an article published by Blabbermouth, and still held hopes for them to reconcile, &quot;But to date the band have refused me that opportunity.&quot; Halford did not dismiss the possibility for Downing to return to Judas Priest in the future. Downing requested for the members to step in and &quot;speak to the press and just make a press release and tell &#x27;em exactly what the deal is&quot;, and give &quot;everybody an insight &#x27;cause people wanna know.&quot; He once again expressed an open interest in performing with Judas Priest again if given the opportunity, and also perform with them at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in 2020 if inducted, due to his inclusion in the band&#x27;s ballot, but was denied the possibility of returning to the band for the 50th-anniversary shows. Downing then made the decision to move forward as a result.

Downing said that he is not interested in rejoining Judas Priest as they became complacent, shifting his newfound attention to his own band KK&#x27;s Priest.

On 5 November 2022, Judas Priest were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as they received the Musical Excellence Award. Downing performed alongside the band for the first time since 2009 as they performed three songs to celebrate their achievement. Downing dismissed the possibility of performing with the band again as he expected for an open chance to be brought back as they were to perform as a quartet on the 50th anniversary tour, but was denied by Tipton and Hill. He said that he offered them one last chance in hopes they wouldn&#x27;t live to regret it.

== Live return ==
After not performing on stage since Judas Priest&#x27;s 30th-anniversary celebration of the 1980 album &quot;British Steel&quot; in 2009, Downing made his live return at the 2019 edition of the Bloodstock Open Air festival where he performed with former Manowar guitarist Ross the Boss as they played the songs &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)&quot;, &quot;Heading Out to the Highway&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and &quot;Running Wild&quot;. He cited it being &quot;a bit of a whirlwind&quot; and the perfect way to get reintroduced to the stage. He also said that there was very little time for him to rehearse as some of the band members arrived the same day of their scheduled rehearsal, &quot;But we did manage to squeeze an hour or so in the following day.&quot; He described the performance as being &quot;a jam, really… And there was quite a bit of improvisation in there. And that&#x27;s where it is.&quot; In a Twitter response from a fan, Richie Faulkner praised Downing&#x27;s performance upon viewing video footage of him, saying that he &quot;looked and sounded great. Good to see the man up on stage where he belongs again.&quot;

Downing, along with former Judas Priest members Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens and Les Binks, former Megadeth bassist David Ellefson and Hostile guitarist A.J. Mills performed a special one-off show in Wolverhampton on 3 November 2019 and played a full set of Judas Priest songs.

== KK&#x27;s Priest ==

In January 2020, Downing signed with Explorer1 Music Group, which paired him with veteran manager Andy Gould, and announced that he would work on brand-new music. The following month, it was announced that Downing had formed a new band, KK&#x27;s Priest, with bassist Tony Newton, guitarist A.J. Mills, and former Judas Priest members Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens and Les Binks on vocals and drums, respectively. The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sermons of the Sinner&quot; was originally scheduled to be released on 20 August 2021, but was postponed until 1 October. A music video for the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Hellfire Thunderbolt&quot;, was released on 12 May 2021. However, Binks did not appear on the album as a result of a wrist injury and was replaced by Cage drummer Sean Elg. Later, Binks occasionally performed live with KK&#x27;s Priest.

When speaking to KNAC in June 2021 about &quot;Sermons of the Sinner&quot;, Downing said that he was already at work on material for the next album, which would be more of a collaboration effort than the first album. In 2023, KK&#x27;s Priest released their second album &quot;The Sinner Rides Again&quot;.

== Musical side projects ==
Downing made a guest appearance on Violent Storm&#x27;s 2005 self-titled debut album, performing on the track &quot;War No More&quot;.

He appeared on the 2012 tribute album &quot;Who Are You? An All Star Tribute to the Who&quot;, which paid tribute to the Who. He performed on the track &quot;Eminence Front&quot;, along with vocalist/bassist John Wetton, keyboardist Derek Sherinian and drummer Billy Sherwood.

Downing appeared on former Queensrÿche vocalist Geoff Tate&#x27;s Queensrÿche-branded 2013 album &quot;Frequency Unknown&quot;, performing the guitar solo on &quot;Running Backwards&quot;.

In 2018, Downing, along with former Judas Priest members Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens and Les Binks, and Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera were featured in a cover version of the song &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot;, fronted by guitarist Paul Crook&#x27;s band Devilstar, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Judas Priest&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Stained Class&quot;.

== Autobiography ==
On 18 September 2018, Downing published his autobiography titled &quot;Heavy Duty: Days and Nights in Judas Priest&quot; via Da Capo Press. It was written by Downing himself along with Mark Eglinton. The memoir details everything from &quot;the complex personality conflicts, the business screw-ups, the acrimonious relationship with fellow heavy metal band Iron Maiden, as well as how Judas Priest found itself at the epicentre of a storm of parental outrage that targeted heavy metal in the &#x27;80s&quot;, according to the book&#x27;s synopsis. It also tells about Downing&#x27;s role in Judas Priest, as well as his decision to leave the band in 2011. It was met with mostly positive reviews.

Since its release, Rob Halford said that he has not taken the time to read Downing&#x27;s autobiography while in production on his own.

== Homes ==

Downing&#x27;s first house was a &quot;tiny semi in Bloxwich&quot;. He has lived in Los Angeles and Florida but no longer owns a home in Spain, but his main abode since 1985 remains Astbury Hall in Shropshire. It is in a very secluded area so he can (as stated in a 2007 interview) &quot;really turn up Marshalls really loud&quot;. Astbury Hall is also home to a championship golf course, a course created by Downing himself and where he has held publicised charity events. Sarah Lissimore, his former girlfriend, mounted a legal challenge for half of his Shropshire estate. This was based on his assertion, &quot;I&#x27;d bet you&#x27;d love to be lady of this Manor, wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot; The High Court of Justice rejected the notion that this assertion could give rise to proprietary estoppel in favour of Lissimore.

In December 2013, it was announced that Downing would be teaming up with a property development finance provider, and golfer Darren Clarke, to help build luxury residential developments on Downing&#x27;s Astbury estate.

Downing told the &quot;Shropshire Star&quot;: &quot;We have had a fantastic season, things were going really well. We had plans for a hotel that we were doing really well with. Obviously there was a necessity for a funding element.
&quot;The company took out a short-term mezzanine fund in early August to take us through to March. This was essentially to bring in professional architects and a team from London. Everything was in place as far as we were concerned.
&quot;Unfortunately about six weeks into the loan we were served a loan termination notice about technical breaches of the agreement.
&quot;We are at the moment looking to re-finance that loan. We were taken aback that the funder was not more flexible with us as partners.
It was put up for sale for £10 million ($13.5 million). Downing maintained that the development was financially stable and viable as he was set to build a luxury hotel for the Marriott Autograph collection and had hoped to host The Open Championship on the estate&#x27;s golf course.

Due to the circumstances surrounding his golf resort investment, Downing placed a share of his royalty rights for 136 Judas Priest songs for sale; the catalogue generates nearly £300,000 ($400,000) per year. Joint administrator Alastair Massey called the songs &quot;a unique investment opportunity&quot; from one of the &quot;driving influences&quot; of Judas Priest&#x27;s success. In July 2018, Round Hill Music acquired the royalty rights to Downing&#x27;s compositions; the catalogue&#x27;s asking price was at least £10 million ($13.5 million). Downing later explained about the sellings of his estate, his golf course and his royalty rights of 136 Judas Priest songs, &quot;I&#x27;m in the process now of recovering everything else through the legal channels. I made a few rubbish business moves, but I can&#x27;t complain really because I did okay. Lots of musicians end up with nothing really, but I had an evaluation on the estate worth in excess of £13 million. Quite a few million pounds&#x27; worth of music royalties and other assets as well. I&#x27;m suing my lawyers for negligence.&quot;

<doc id="262463" wikidata="Q317469" url="?curid=262463" title="Glenn Tipton">
<text>Glenn Raymond Tipton (born 25 October 1947) is an English guitarist. Often noted for his complex playing style and classically influenced solos, he is best known as one of the lead guitarists for the heavy metal band Judas Priest. He is the second longest-serving member of the band, after bassist Ian Hill. Tipton and Hill are the only two members of the band who have appeared on every studio album.

==Early life==
Tipton was born on 25 October 1947, in Blackheath, Staffordshire, to Olive and Doug Tipton. He attended Olive Hill Primary School when he was about five years old. His brother, Gary, was a guitar player for a local band called the Atlantics. Early on, Tipton was taught to play the piano by his mother.

Tipton learned to play guitar at age 19 with his first guitar being a Hofner acoustic guitar. He would then play a Rickenbacker until he was able to afford a Fender Stratocaster. This guitar would become his main live guitar until it was stolen after a show in Newcastle. Tipton soon bought a black Stratocaster and, later, a Gibson SG Special afterwards with money he received to replace his stolen guitar. He can be seen playing both of these guitars during Judas Priest&#x27;s appearance on the Old Grey Whistle Test in 1975.

== Career ==
Tipton&#x27;s first band was Shave &#x27;Em Dry, with future Starfighters and Ozzy Osbourne drummer Barry Scrannage, which became Merlin, later becoming The Flying Hat Band. This band soon broke up due to management issues. In May 1974, Tipton joined Judas Priest, and coincidentally Scrannage had joined the band Bullion with earlier Judas Priest members Ernest Chataway and Bruno Staphenhill. This was during the recording for &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot;, so Tipton quickly added his guitar parts to the album. On &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot;, Tipton showed off more of his guitar work on songs like &quot;Tyrant&quot;, &quot;Dreamer Deceiver&quot; and &quot;Victim of Changes&quot;. Tipton also presented his own songwriting on the songs &quot;Prelude&quot;, &quot;Epitaph&quot; and &quot;The Ripper&quot;. He frequently played keyboards on the early albums, although those were no longer featured on any songs after &quot;Killing Machine&quot;. He is credited with introducing a more metal sound to the band with those songs, as Rocka Rolla was composed of largely blues rock and psychedelic songs left over from the band&#x27;s former frontman Al Atkins. Although Tipton wrote the lyrics for the songs shortly after joining Judas Priest, producer Rodger Bain rejected putting them on the first album as being not commercial enough. From then onward, Halford and Tipton would be the band&#x27;s principal songwriters with occasional contributions from Downing.1980&#x27;s &quot;British Steel&quot; was Judas Priest&#x27;s commercial breakthrough. This album combined the band&#x27;s trademark heavy metal sound with pop-style song structures and hooks. &quot;United&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; were some of Judas Priest&#x27;s first guitar-driven songs not to include any solo sections. Judas Priest quickly shot to rock superstar status during the 1980s with their albums &quot;Point of Entry&quot;, &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot;, &quot;Turbo&quot; and &quot;Ram It Down&quot;, entering the 1990s with the album &quot;Painkiller&quot;.

Rob Halford left Judas Priest in 1992 and the band went on hiatus. During their split, Tipton wrote material for a solo project he formed in the mid-1990s. His first solo effort was the album &quot;Baptizm of Fire&quot;, which was released in 1997, followed by &quot;Edge of the World&quot; in 2006, which was a project from the sessions for &quot;Baptizm of Fire&quot; released under the name &quot;Tipton, Entwistle and Powell&quot; in tribute to John Entwistle and Cozy Powell who contributed to the initial sessions. In 1996, Judas Priest reformed with new vocalist Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens. This new version of the band recorded the albums &quot;Jugulator&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Demolition&quot; in 2001. Both of these albums experimented with new sounds that distinguished them from the records with Halford. In 2003, Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford and toured in celebration of his return in 2004. The band released &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot; in 2005 and &quot;Nostradamus&quot; in 2008. In 2010, Judas Priest announced their &quot;Epitaph World Tour&quot;, which was to be the last major world tour, which was also their first tour without original guitarist K. K. Downing, and the first to feature his replacement, Richie Faulkner. The band later retracted this announcement, and released their seventeenth album &quot;Redeemer of Souls&quot; in July 2014, as well as supporting the album with a world tour.

On 12 February 2018, Tipton announced that he would step down from touring when he revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He stated that he was still a member of the band despite his diagnosis and would not rule out future on-stage appearances. Producer and guitarist Andy Sneap replaced him on tour. On 9 March 2018, the eighteenth album &quot;Firepower&quot; was released. At the 20 March 2018 show in Newark, New Jersey, Tipton joined the band on stage to perform &quot;Metal Gods&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; and &quot;Living After Midnight&quot;, then &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; and &quot;No Surrender&quot; on later dates. Prior to the band&#x27;s performance, he expressed uncertainty regarding his future role in Judas Priest, &quot;It&#x27;s an unanswerable question, really. It&#x27;s in the lap of the metal gods.&quot; After performing on stage with the band, he described it as &quot;emotional&quot;, and being overwhelmed with support from the band members and from fans worldwide, &quot;You don’t like to see a grown man cry, but we did.&quot; Tipton did not make any more appearances on the remaining dates of the band&#x27;s world tour due to his illness, as explained by bassist Ian Hill.

==Personal life and illness==
Tipton lives in the village of Romsley, Worcestershire, in the West Midlands near Birmingham, England, and has a state-of-the-art recording studio built next to his home. During the 1980s he also bought a property in Spain. He has two children, Karina and Rick, both of whom played on his solo album &quot;Baptizm of Fire&quot;.

On 12 February 2018, Tipton revealed that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, with which he was first diagnosed in 2008, thus ceasing his duties to perform on tour as the disease&#x27;s progression left him unable to play the more challenging material. Rob Halford said that Tipton rejected the idea of having to be assisted with an additional guitarist backstage on tour for cover on some of his guitar parts or to use backing tracks. He then said that he witnessed first-hand the struggles Tipton experienced during the making of &quot;Firepower&quot;. Halford later said that Tipton made his decision five days prior to his public announcement, adding that Tipton would be &quot;with us in spirit – every show, every song&quot; on tour, and being overwhelmed by positive support and responses from fans. Bassist Ian Hill explained that Tipton faced a similar situation during rehearsals for the Redeemer of Souls Tour in 2014. At the time of the announcement, he said that Tipton made the decision to step off the stage due to his health, which caused emotional heartache for the band. Tipton said that he was shocked to hear the news of his diagnosis and &quot;made me even more determined to fight. I could still play, so I just continued recording and touring.&quot; He would later say that he was &quot;sort of shocked&quot;, describing it as &quot;a pretty cruel disease.&quot;

In June 2018, Judas Priest launched the &quot;Glenn Tipton Parkinson&#x27;s Foundation&quot; in Tipton&#x27;s honour, in which they would sell specially designed t-shirts featuring Tipton playing guitar on the front and with the slogan &quot;No Surrender&quot; on the back with the Judas Priest cross on it. Tipton explains that the foundation would help raise money in hopes of finding a cure for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He also says that a new &quot;pioneering treatment&quot; from his personal specialist would also help treat other sufferers of the disease. Hill said that the band had known for some time that Tipton was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease before his announcement, again recalling the difficulties during the first days of the Redeemer of Souls Tour, but improved as time progressed. He says that Tipton&#x27;s &quot;as good as anyone can be given the situation. Glenn is out with us most of the time, anyway. And when he&#x27;s feeling well enough he&#x27;ll get on stage, and I can&#x27;t promise anything, but he&#x27;ll get up and do the encores with us.&quot;

Tipton&#x27;s daughter, Karina Greenin, took part in an annual marathon in Barcelona to help raise funds for her father&#x27;s foundation, which exceeded her £3,500 goal. Richie Faulkner recalled that Tipton was diagnosed during the Redeemer of Souls Tour, &quot;maybe, actually, a bit before. So, after the &#x27;Epitaph&#x27; tour, but before the &#x27;Redeemer Of Souls&#x27; tour he got diagnosed, and they told him that he had it for quite a few years before that, but he didn&#x27;t know. He kept it quiet, which is his business… He chose to go and check it out and they told him that it was the onset Parkinson&#x27;s, and he told us. But he was able to do the &#x27;Redeemer Of Souls&#x27; tour.&quot; He then said that the set had to be slightly changed in order to accommodate him. The band did not perform a few songs on the first part of the tour, but upon their appearance in Australia, they began to perform them due to Tipton&#x27;s resurgence in his health and managed to successfully perform the entire tour, but stepped down during rehearsals for the Firepower World Tour due to the disease&#x27;s progression which caused emotional heartbreak for the band. Tipton expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the fans for their support for him, &quot;particularly over the past year which has been a tough one for me...thank you all so much! No surrender!!&quot;

Faulkner provided an update on Tipton in July 2020, saying that he was still in good spirits, but was &quot;going a bit nuts&quot; due to the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Former Judas Priest guitarist K.K. Downing and drummer Les Binks joined the band on stage for the first time in over a decade to perform alongside Tipton during their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2022.

Tipton joined Judas Priest in the Power Trip show on October 7 2023. Judas Priest played an encore with &quot;Hell Bent for Leather,&quot; then Halford welcomed Tipton to the stage for the final three songs of the set - &quot;Metal Gods,&quot; &quot;Breaking The Law&quot; and &quot;Living After Midnight.&quot;

==Influences==
Tipton said: &quot;It goes without saying that I love playing and performing heavy metal, and have for most of my career. Going right back though, I&#x27;ve listened to a lot of early blues players, and I think the first band I saw live that really made an impression on me, was The Spencer Davis Group. I remember going to see them play at an all-nighter at Birmingham Town Hall. Steve Winwood was a great all round vocalist, guitarist and keyboard player and I remember trying to learn &#x27;Georgia&#x27; on the piano after I had seen them play. They had great songs like &#x27;Keep on Running&#x27; and although you could try and categorize them as blues or R&amp;B, they really had their own sound going for them, mainly due I believe to Steve Winwood&quot;.

Other early influences were Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. &quot;I still can&#x27;t believe where Hendrix came from. OK Seattle maybe but he just suddenly appeared, as if from nowhere, this black guy playing guitar in a way no one had imagined it could be played. He was more than a genius in my eyes, someone very, very special. I loved early Purple and the combined sound of organ and guitar gave them a very powerful sound, again unique at the time. As for Zeppelin, what can you say, &#x27;Whole Lotta Love&#x27;, &#x27;Communication Breakdown&#x27;, &#x27;Black Dog&#x27;, and the epic &#x27;Kashmir&#x27; again a unique band with great songs. All these bands formed an impression on me going back to those early days.

&quot;I liked the early Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer. I thought Peter Green was a great white blues player and song-writer. He not only penned such greats as &#x27;Green Manalishi&#x27; and &#x27;Oh Well&#x27; but more delicate compositions such as &#x27;Need Your Love So Bad&#x27; or &#x27;Albatross&#x27; I saw them several times and it was great to watch them perform songs like &#x27;Stop Messin&#x27; Around&#x27; or songs featuring slide guitar such as &#x27;Dust My Broom&#x27;.

&quot;As I&#x27;ve said before, as a guitar player my main inspiration was Rory Gallagher. I saw him play in Taste many times and he really inspired me, not just musically but also in the amount of energy and feel he put out&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;ve always loved The Rolling Stones. They have so many classic songs such as &#x27;Jumping Jack Flash&#x27;, &#x27;Honky Tonk Women&#x27;, &#x27;Sympathy for the Devil&#x27;, &#x27;Brown Sugar&#x27;, or their earlier stuff like &#x27;This Could Be The Last Time&#x27;, &#x27;Paint It, Black&#x27;, &#x27;It&#x27;s All Over Now&#x27; the list goes on and on. The Stones have great attitude and that rebel quality that&#x27;s so appealing. I recently saw them at the Isle of Wight festival and they were as good as ever after all these years&quot;.

&quot;As do many people, I think The Beatles were a great band. We were all lucky that fate put these guys together in our time. It totally amazes me that they came up with such an abundance of classic songs in such a relatively short amount of time. The Beatles changed everything. To start with they were the first band to write their own material. They were so prolific and the endless melodies they invented will live forever&quot;.

Tipton is a big fan of soundtrack music, something that is evident in listening to Judas Priest&#x27;s metal opera &quot;Nostradamus&quot;. &quot;I love people like Hans Zimmer,&quot; Tipton told Attention Deficit Delirium. &quot;Some of the stuff that they do is incredible.&quot; (He&#x27;s a big fan of the &quot;Gladiator&quot; soundtrack.) &quot;One day when I&#x27;m good enough to, I wouldn&#x27;t even call it a film score, but do music for film, I&#x27;d like that opportunity. It would be really exciting for me to do. Whether that will happen or not, I&#x27;m not sure. I would certainly welcome the opportunity to do something like that as long as it were something that I liked or had respect for visually.&quot;

==Equipment==

===Tone===
In the late 1980s, around the time of the Turbo album, Priest began incorporating guitar synths. Starting with the comeback album &quot;Jugulator&quot;, Glenn switched to Rocktron preamps, the Rocktron Intellifex for effects, and Crate heads and cabs. 
Tipton used SGs and a Stratocaster with two DiMarzio Super Distortion humbuckers as his main instruments until the mid 80s when he started using various Hamer guitars including some signature models, which were used almost exclusively in live performances until 2009 when the Stratocaster and one of the SGs was brought out of retirement for the British Steel 30th anniversary tour. Most of his guitars are equipped with Kahler tremolos. Glenn uses standard-light (10–46) gauge strings produced by Ernie Ball and thin picks. Throughout his career, Glenn has used many tunings, most frequently standard tuning (almost all of the songs written before Rob Halford left the band were originally in E-standard). Ever since Rob Halford rejoined Judas Priest, both Glenn and KK have used E-flat tuning during live shows, while still using standard tuning extensively on studio albums.

===Guitars===
Tipton has used numerous guitars over the years. These include a 1960s Fender Stratocaster up until about 1978. During the period from 1978 to 1979, he used a black Gibson Les Paul Custom, and he started using a modified CBS-era Fender Stratocaster with Dimarzio Super-Distortion (humbucking) pickups. For the &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; tour, he added a chrome pickguard. For this tour, he also played a Gibson SG Special that he spray-painted black himself. The SG also had a chrome pickguard and stock PAF humbuckers. Around 1984, he switched to a Hamer Phantom GT model, which was fitted with one EMG humbucker, a Kahler tremolo, and one volume pot. A signature model of this was developed and sold to public from 1984 to 1986. Tipton still uses this guitar model, but now with Seymour Duncan Blackouts active pickups. In 2009, Tipton took his Fender Stratocaster and Gibson SG Special out of retirement for the British Steel 30th Anniversary tour. As of late 2015, he is now officially endorsing ESP guitars, with his own signature model, the GT-600, which is part of ESP&#x27;s LTD series of guitars and in terms of shape is modeled after ESP&#x27;s Viper series of guitars.

He has also used various guitars over the years 
*ESP LTD GT-600 – using currently
*Fender Telecaster – For studio use
*ESP Eclipse acoustic – For stage use
*Ibanez 7621 seven-string guitar – In the studio for Demolition (Possibly used for the song &quot;In Between&quot;)
*Gibson Explorer – Could be seen on the Classic Albums: British Steel documentary and was used sparingly during the Nostradamus tour
*Legends custom-built acrylic Jaguar-shaped guitar – Tipton jokingly admitted that he wanted to make a lamp out of it, but liked the tone of it and was used for recording Demolition),
*Roland G-707 synth guitar – was mostly used in the studio, used a Hamer Phantom GT with a Roland Hex pickup for stage use

Tipton has almost exclusively used Marshall Amplifiers for live performances. Tipton used 50 and 100 watt Marshall heads without a master volume until 1981, when the JCM 800 head was developed. The JCM 800 was used by Tipton and fellow Judas Priest guitarist K.K. Downing for many years. During the Jugulator and Demolition era, Tipton was endorsed by Crate amplifiers, using their Blue Voodoo heads in the studio, home, and when touring. He dropped this endorsement during the 2004 reunion tour for live performances switching to a large rack unit with multiple preamps and effects processors with a Marshall 9100 power amp.

In 2008, Tipton began using ENGL amps. Of the brand, he comments, &quot;ENGL is the first ampline that I have ever used that not only has balls, but attitude, right out of the box&quot;. When he first used Engl amps, he played through the ENGL Midi Tube Preamp E 580 and the ENGL Tube Poweramp E 850/50. For the Epitaph tour, he switched to using ENGL Invaders that are modified to use 6L6 power tubes.

Glenn uses for his home studio in England (and primary practice amp) the generation 1: Crate Blue Voodoo BV 120H all tube, all American head with the blue tolex (not the black or red tolex of later generations). This amp is seen in several of his demonstration videos and guitar collection tour videos online and caused a run on this amp by fans forcing the prices to rise rapidly in the used market for shrinking supply of the amp (due to its age and limited production run) ...this phenomenon is not unlike the fan run situation on the small marshall amps (5005) used by Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top.

===Effects===
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tipton used a Pete Cornish custom pedalboard with an overdrive unit, flanger, MXR distortion unit, MXR Phase 100, MXR digital delay, MXR 12-band EQ, Maestro Echoplex, line boosters between each effect to preserve the signal from input to output, and a Rangemaster-based custom treble boost connected to the bass channel of Marshall 50 and 100 watt heads with no master volume.

Around the time of the reunion with Rob Halford, Tipton only used a modified Crybaby 535Q Wah, Digitech Tone Driver, DigiTech Main Squeeze, and a Yamaha midi board controlling other effects and sounds in a rack unit.

Since the beginning of the 2008 world tour, Glenn has gone back to mostly using a rack system, sans the current use of Engl amp heads. He currently uses a Korg rack tuner, Furman power unit, Dunlop Custom Shop Rackmounted Crybaby, Rocktron Intellifex and Yamaha SPX-90 multi-effects units, and a dbx 166A compressor and noise gate.

<doc id="262464" wikidata="Q190051" url="?curid=262464" title="Jamie Oliver">
<text>Jamie Trevor Oliver MBE OSI (born 27 May 1975) is an English celebrity chef, restaurateur and cookbook author. He is known for his casual approach to cuisine, which has led him to front numerous television shows and open many restaurants.

Oliver reached the public eye when his BBC Two series &quot;The Naked Chef&quot; premiered in 1999. In 2005, he started a campaign, Feed Me Better, to introduce schoolchildren to healthier foods, which was later backed by the government. He was the owner of a restaurant chain, Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group, which opened its first restaurant, Jamie&#x27;s Italian, in Oxford in 2008. The chain went into administration in May 2019.

Oliver is the second-best-selling British author, behind J. K. Rowling, and the best-selling British non-fiction author since records began. , Oliver had sold more than 14.55 million books. His TED Talk won him the 2010 TED Prize. In June 2003, Oliver was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for &quot;services to the hospitality industry&quot;.

==Early life==
Jamie Trevor Oliver was born and raised in Clavering, Essex. His parents, Trevor and Sally ( Palmer) Oliver, ran a pub/restaurant, the Cricketers, where he practised cooking in the kitchen with his parents. He has a sister, and was educated at Newport Free Grammar School.

He left school at the age of 16 with two GCSE qualifications in art and geology and went on to attend Westminster Technical College (now Westminster Kingsway College). He earned a City &amp; Guilds National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in home economics.

==Career==

Oliver&#x27;s first job was a pastry chef at Antonio Carluccio&#x27;s Neal Street restaurant, where he first gained experience at preparing Italian cuisine, and developed a relationship with his mentor Gennaro Contaldo; later in his career Oliver employed Contaldo to help run his chain of high street restaurants, Jamie&#x27;s Italian. Oliver moved to the River Cafe in Fulham, as a sous-chef. He was noticed there by the BBC in 1997, after making an unscripted appearance in the documentary &quot;Christmas at the River Cafe&quot;.

In 1999, Oliver&#x27;s BBC Two show &quot;The Naked Chef&quot; debuted, and his cookbook became a bestseller in the United Kingdom. That same year, he was invited to prepare lunch for Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street.

After three series of &quot;Naked Chef&quot; programmes (&quot;The Naked Chef&quot;, &quot;Return of the Naked Chef&quot; and &quot;Happy Days with The Naked Chef&quot;) for the BBC, Oliver moved to Channel 4 in 2002, following BBC Two&#x27;s decision not to renew his contract with the network, after Oliver had appeared in similarly-themed TV cookery advertisements for Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket. His first Channel 4 series was a documentary, &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, which began in November 2002, and followed the setting up of Fifteen restaurant in London. The restaurant, in Westland Place, London continued to train young adults who have a disadvantaged background for careers in the restaurant business until its closure on 21 May 2019.

In June 2003, Oliver was awarded an MBE for his services to the hospitality industry. Although it is customary to wear morning dress or a lounge suit for the event, Oliver did not wear a tie with his brown Paul Smith suit, saying: &quot;I like ties but I prefer not to wear one when I am nervous.&quot;

In 2005, Oliver was widely criticised by animal rights groups for slaughtering a lamb on his TV show without first stunning it, with PETA stating that it showed to the public problems with the methods used within slaughterhouses. PETA spokesman Sean Gifford said that it was hoped the footage &quot;could turn the more die-hard carnivore into a vegetarian&quot;. TV regulator Ofcom reported seven complaints from the public.

Since 2020, Oliver&#x27;s cooking of traditional Asian dishes such as egg fried rice have been criticised by Malaysian comic Nigel Ng, through his Uncle Roger character.

In November 2023, Oliver opened a new restaurant in London, his first since the collapse of his restaurant chain. Jamie Oliver Catherine Street was launched in partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber’s LW Theatres at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In March 2024, Oliver opened a restaurant in Serbia, &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Italian Belgrade&quot;, his first in this part of Europe, located in the Belgrade Waterfront quarter.

In 2023, Oliver released his first children&#x27;s book &quot;Billy and the Giant Adventure&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Billy and the Epic Escape&quot; was released the following March, depicted the same children as the first book on a fantastic summer vacation. Led by an Australian Indigenous Australian education advocacy group, the sequel was sharply criticised for its representation of Indigenous Australians, and as being insensitive to the history of the Stolen Generations. In November, Oliver recalled the book and said he apologised for unintentionally causing offense.

Oliver&#x27;s holding company, Jamie Oliver Holdings Ltd., earned enough for Oliver to have been listed on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; list of richest Britons under 30. Oliver&#x27;s net worth was estimated in 2014 at £240 million. A decade later, his net worth was estimated at £173 million. Oliver was chosen by Disney Pixar to provide the voice of the health inspector in the UK version of &quot;Ratatouille&quot;. In December 2009, Oliver received the 2010 TED Prize. He hosted &quot;Jamie&#x27;s 15 Minute Meals&quot; on Channel 4, which aired for 40 episodes in 2012.

Oliver is the second-best-selling British author, behind J. K. Rowling, and the best-selling British non-fiction author since records began. , Oliver had sold more than 14.55 million books, generating just under £180m for the chef.

===Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group===

In June 2008, Oliver launched a restaurant, Jamie&#x27;s Italian, his first high street business venture, in Oxford, England. At its peak, there were 42 Jamie&#x27;s Italian restaurants in the UK. The brand was franchised via the Jamie Oliver Restaurant Group (JORG), and included branches in Australia (which Oliver part-bought back in November 2016 after its founders went bankrupt), Canada, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Iceland, Ireland, Qatar, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey, the UAE and Singapore. 

In 2011, Oliver, an advocate of cooking meals from scratch and using local produce, caused controversy after it turned out the sauces used in Jamie&#x27;s Italian in Glasgow were from an industrial park almost away in Bicester. That same year, he came under fire for lack of food safety protections in his restaurants and illnesses associated with under-cooking mincemeat that may have been contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot;.

In 2011, Oliver set up Barbecoa, a barbecued meat-based restaurant with his friend, American barbecue expert Adam Perry Lang. There were two outlets, both in London, one in Piccadilly and a second in St Pauls. In 2014 the Piccadilly outlet voluntarily closed for 24 hours after hygiene inspectors gave it the second-lowest rating. &quot;The Times&quot; reported they had found mouse droppings, mouldy carcasses and out-of-date meat. In February 2018, JORG confirmed that they had &quot;instructed a firm of real estate agents to ascertain the potential value and market suitability of two of our sites&quot;. On 19 February 2018, Barbecoa Ltd went into administration, with Oliver immediately buying back the St Paul&#x27;s site in a pre-packed agreement via a new subsidiary.

In January 2017, Chief Executive Simon Blagden announced the closure of six restaurants in the UK affecting 120 jobs, at sites in Aberdeen, Cheltenham, Exeter, Royal Tunbridge Wells, and in London at Ludgate and Richmond.

In January 2018, as part of an agreement with creditors to secure £71.5M of debt, JORG proposed to enter the UK company Jamie&#x27;s Italian Ltd into a company voluntary arrangement, seeking rent reductions on eight outlets and closing a further 12 in Bath, Bristol, Bluewater, Chelmsford, Harrogate, Kingston, Milton Keynes, Reading, and St Albans, and Greenwich, Piccadilly and Threadneedle Street in London. As part of the agreement, court papers revealed that Jamie&#x27;s Italian had debts of £71.5m, including £2.3 million in wages owed to staff; £30.2 million of overdrafts and loans; £41.3 million owed to landlords, HM Revenue and Customs, suppliers and other creditors; with £47 million of the debts covered by loans from HSBC Bank and Oliver&#x27;s other companies.

The group went into administration on 21 May 2019 with 22 of 25 restaurants closed and 1,000 jobs lost. Jamie&#x27;s Italian restaurants and Jamie Oliver&#x27;s Diner at Gatwick Airport continued operations until they were sold to catering company SSP Group. Jamie Oliver&#x27;s Fifteen Cornwall at Watergate Bay, as well as 61 overseas locations and the catering services operated by Aramark in the U.S., are all operated by franchisees so they were unaffected.

In January 2020, KPMG, the firm administrators, said that most of the £80 million Jamie Oliver&#x27;s restaurant chain owed after its collapse in May 2019 will not be recovered. Hundreds of suppliers, as well as some town councils, will bear the brunt of the losses. In 2020, an employment tribunal ruled that Oliver&#x27;s restaurants broke labour laws by failing to consult employees prior to making them redundant. He partnered with Toronto restaurateur King Street Co. and executive chef Rob Gentile to open Jamie&#x27;s Italians including a location in Yorkdale Shopping Centre.

===Advertising===

From June 2000, Oliver became the public face of the Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket chain in the UK, appearing on television and radio advertisements and in-store promotional material. The deal earned him an estimated £1.2 million every year, although neither J. Sainsbury nor Oliver has ever discussed the exact figure. By 2004, the company had made 65 advertisements with him, but the arrangement was not without controversy. Oliver was reported to have admitted that he does not use supermarkets, despite regularly having &quot;product placement&quot; in his early TV series.

He was criticised by Sainsbury&#x27;s CEO Justin King after Oliver slammed the &quot;junk&quot; sold by supermarkets that ends up in the lunchboxes of millions of children. King reportedly hit back, saying: &quot;Dictating to people—or unleashing an expletive-filled tirade—is not the way to get engagement.&quot; In July 2011, after eleven years, the partnership between Oliver and Sainsbury&#x27;s ended. The final television advertisement was for Christmas 2011.

Oliver also promotes a range of non-stick pans and cookware for Tefal and has appeared in Australian television commercials for Yalumba wines, using Del Boy&#x27;s catchphrase of &quot;Lovely Jubbly&quot;.

In August 2013, Oliver and Canadian supermarket chain Sobeys announced a partnership in improving nationwide nutrition and advertising campaigns. In October 2013, he began a partnership with the Australian chain Woolworths Supermarkets on a series of better nutrition initiatives and advertising campaigns.

In 2014, Oliver became the culinary face of Woolworths Supermarkets. Oliver came under strong criticism over the funding of the advertising surrounding his relationship with the supermarket.

In January 2016, Oliver and HelloFresh, an international meal kit subscription service, announced a partnership to incorporate his recipes to the weekly subscription deliveries. Customers receive one recipe written by Jamie Oliver with all the exact ingredients and steps for the dish. HelloFresh also agreed to the Jamie Oliver Food Foundation per Meal Box in addition to supporting other Foundation activities.

In September 2018, Oliver created a series of recipes and tips for Tesco and participated in the promotion of the company&#x27;s food products.

In 2019, Oliver partnered with Royal Dutch Shell to offer a Jamie Oliver Deli by Shell branded range at 500 Shell petrol stations in the UK for £5 million. The deal was criticised as a way to improve their image due to Shell&#x27;s lack of action on climate change, corruption and bribery allegations and damaged Oliver&#x27;s image of working in the interests of children and for action on climate change.

==Charity work and campaigning==
Oliver conceived and established the Fifteen charity restaurant, where he trained disadvantaged young people to work in the hospitality industry. Following the success of the original restaurant in London, more Fifteens have opened around the globe: Fifteen Amsterdam opened in December 2004, Fifteen Cornwall in Newquay in May 2006 and Fifteen Melbourne in September 2006 with an Australian friend and fellow chef Tobie Puttock. Fifteen Melbourne has since closed, as has Fifteen Cornwall.

In 2005, Oliver initiated a campaign originally called &quot;Feed Me Better&quot; to move British schoolchildren towards eating healthy foods and cutting out junk food. As a result, the British government also pledged to address the issue. His public campaign for changes in nutrition resulted in people voting him as the &quot;Most Inspiring Political Figure of 2005&quot;, according to a Channel 4 News annual viewer poll. His emphasis on cooking fresh, nutritious food continued as he created &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Ministry of Food&quot;, a television series where Oliver travelled to inspire everyday people in Rotherham, Yorkshire, to cook healthy meals. Another television series is &quot;Jamie Oliver&#x27;s Food Revolution&quot; (2010–11), where he travelled first to Huntington, West Virginia and then to Los Angeles to change the way Americans eat, and address their dependence on fast food.

Oliver began a formal campaign to ban unhealthy food in British schools and to get children eating nutritious food instead. Oliver&#x27;s efforts to bring radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series &quot;Jamie&#x27;s School Dinners&quot;, challenged the junk-food culture by showing schools they could serve healthy, cost-efficient meals that kids enjoyed eating. His efforts brought the subject of school dinners to the political forefront and changed the types of food served in schools.

In December 2009, Oliver was awarded the 2010 TED Prize for his campaigns to &quot;create change on both the individual and governmental levels&quot; to &quot;bring attention to the changes that the English, and now Americans, need to make in their lifestyles and diet&quot;. In 2010, he joined several other celebrity chefs on the series &quot;The Big Fish Fight&quot;, in which Oliver and fellow chefs Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Gordon Ramsay made a variety of programmes to raise awareness about the discarding of hundreds of thousands of saltwater fish because the fishermen are prohibited from keeping any fish other than the stated target of the trawl. He is a patron of environmental charity Trees for Cities. 

In April 2022, he co-organized together with Ukrainian chef Yurii Kovryzhenko a charity dinner in London within an initiative #CookForUkraine to raise money for Ukrainians who suffered from Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Oliver and Gordon Ramsay are spokespeople for the &quot;Big Fish Fight&quot;, which campaigns for sustainable seafood, but were criticised for their use of endangered fish.

Oliver has been criticised for underestimating the cost of supposedly cheap food he encouraged poor people to prepare for themselves, as well as for an unrealistic view of poverty in Britain and round the Mediterranean. Cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe stated that Oliver&#x27;s comments &quot;support damaging myths that poor people are only poor because they spend their money on the wrong things, rather than being constrained by time, equipment, knowledge or practicalities&quot;.

== Views ==
Oliver has spoken out against Marco Pierre White, who has been critical of Oliver in the past, and the swearing of Gordon Ramsay.

In February 2017, Oliver criticised the Red Tractor scheme, earning the ire of farming leaders, such as Minette Batters, the president of the NFU. Oliver said: &quot;Chickens are bred to grow fast with a high ratio of meat to bone, but this makes them heavy so they can struggle to walk...I think people would be shocked by the reality of what we are buying...I personally wouldn&#x27;t feed it to my kids.&quot; Batters responded: &quot;There are a lot of people on tight budgets and they must not be disadvantaged in all of this. It is about making sure we can provide quality affordable, safe, traceable food to everybody regardless of budgets, regardless of background.&quot;
==Awards and honours==
On 13 May 2001, Oliver&#x27;s series &quot;The Naked Chef&quot; won the BAFTA award for &quot;Best Feature&quot; at the prestigious 2001 British Academy Television Awards, held at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane, London.

In June 2003, Oliver was awarded the MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

On 21 August 2010, Oliver won an Emmy for &quot;Jamie Oliver&#x27;s Food Revolution&quot; at the 62nd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. The series tackled the problem of childhood obesity in America.

In 2013, Oliver was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the Royal College of General Practitioners for his work in tackling childhood obesity by improving the nutritional value of school dinners.

In 2019, Oliver was awarded the Order of the Star of Italy with the rank of Knight. The investiture took place at the Italian embassy in 2021.

==Personal life==
In July 2000, Oliver married the former model and writer Juliette Norton, usually known as &quot;Jools&quot;. They have five children. Oliver has severe dyslexia, and read his first novel, &quot;Catching Fire&quot;, by American novelist Suzanne Collins (the second book in the three-book &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; series) in 2013, at the age of 38.

During the summer of 2019, Oliver and his family moved into Spains Hall, the 16th-century mansion in Finchingfield, Essex. The property is located on a estate and includes a six-bedroom farmhouse, three-bedroom lodge, swimming pool, tennis court and converted stables.

==Television shows==
=== Other media appearances ===
Oliver has twice guest-hosted Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; and has made two appearances in the &quot;Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car&quot; segment of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;. In his first appearance he attempted to make a green salad in the back of his Volkswagen Microbus, which was fitted with a Porsche engine, while the Stig drove it around the &quot;Top Gear&quot; test track. 

Oliver is the second British celebrity chef (after Robert Irvine) to appear as a challenger on &quot;Iron Chef America,&quot; taking on Iron Chef Mario Batali in 2008 in a losing battle with cobia as the theme ingredient.

Oliver was one of the judges in the &quot;Oprah&#x27;s Big Give&quot; hosted by Oprah Winfrey in the United States in 2008.

Oliver took to the road once more in 2006 on an Australian tour where he performed in Sydney and Melbourne. Following the entertaining format of his first live show, the 2006 Australian tour featuring special guests including mentor Gennaro Contaldo, and students from Fifteen London. He performed a new song written by Leigh Haggerwood called &quot;Fish Stew&quot; which Oliver cooked to and also drummed along to at the end of the show. The shows were featured in a one-off TV documentary called &quot;Jamie Oliver: Australian Diary&quot;.

On 27 December 2022, Oliver was the Guest Editor on the Today Programme on BBC Radio 4.

<text>Mad Max 2 (released as The Road Warrior in the United States) is a 1981 Australian post-apocalyptic dystopian action film directed by George Miller, who co-wrote it with Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant. It is the second instalment in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; franchise. The film stars Mel Gibson reprising his role as &quot;Mad Max&quot; Rockatansky and follows a hardened man who helps a community of settlers to defend themselves against a roving band of marauders. Filming took place in locations around Broken Hill, in the Outback of New South Wales.

&quot;Mad Max 2&quot; was released in Australia on 24 December 1981 to widespread critical acclaim, with particular praise given to Gibson&#x27;s performance, the musical score, cinematography, action sequences, costume design and sparing use of dialogue. It was also a box office success, and the film&#x27;s post-apocalyptic and punk aesthetics helped popularise the genre in film and fiction writing. At the 10th Saturn Awards, the film won Best International Film and was nominated for five more awards: Best Director, Best Actor for Gibson, Best Supporting Actor for Bruce Spence, Best Writing, and Best Costumes for Norma Moriceau. &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; is widely hailed as both one of the greatest action films of all time and one of the greatest sequels ever made, and fan clubs for the film and &quot;road warrior&quot;-themed activities continue into the 21st century.

Preceded by &quot;Mad Max&quot; in 1979, the film was followed by &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; in 1985, &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; in 2015 and &quot;&quot; in 2024.

==Plot==

After a global war results in widespread oil shortages and ecocide, civilization collapses, and the world descends into barbarism. Former policeman Max Rockatansky, haunted by the death of his family, drives around the desert Outback of what was once Australia, scavenging for food and petrol with his dog. He outmaneuvers a group of marauders led by biker Wez using his driving skills and a shotgun. He steals gasoline from the wrecked vehicles of one of his pursuers and inspects a wrecked semi-trailer and prime mover.

Later, Max tries collecting an apparently abandoned gyrocopter&#x27;s fuel, but is ambushed by the pilot. Max overpowers the man with his dog&#x27;s help, sparing his life in return for being led to a working oil refinery the pilot has discovered. They arrive during the daily attack on the facility by a motorised gang, of which Wez is a member.

The next day, Max witnesses cars leave the besieged compound and get chased down by marauders. He rescues Nathan, the sole survivor of one car, and strikes a deal to return him to the complex in exchange for fuel, but the man dies after Max gets him back, and the leader of the settlers, Pappagallo, says the deal died with Nathan. The settlers are about to confiscate Max&#x27;s car and cast him out of their compound when the marauders return to negotiate. A feral child who lives in the refinery compound kills Wez&#x27;s partner with a metal boomerang and Wez wants revenge, but the gang&#x27;s leader, a masked man called &quot;Lord Humungus&quot;, offers to spare the settlers&#x27; lives in exchange for their fuel supply and leaves for the day. However, the settlers are divided over whether or not they can trust Humungus.

Max offers his own deal: he will bring them the semi-truck he saw earlier so they can try to haul away their tanker full of oil, if they return his car and give him as much fuel as he can carry. The settlers agree, and that night Max sneaks past the marauders on foot carrying fuel for the truck. He encounters the Gyro Captain and forces him to fly him to the truck, which he gets started. It is somewhat damaged as Max passes through the marauders&#x27; encampment en route to the refinery, but he makes it, followed by the gyrocopter.

Max refuses Pappagallo&#x27;s entreaty to accompany the settlers to a fabled northern paradise, opting instead to collect his fuel and leave. Wez catches him using Humungus&#x27;s nitrous oxide-equipped vehicle and causes him to crash. A Marauder kills Max&#x27;s dog and is about to kill the seriously-injured Max when Marauder Toadie attempts to siphon the fuel from the tanks of Max&#x27;s car, triggering the vehicle to self-destruct. Left for dead, Max is rescued by the Gyro Captain and returned to the compound.

Despite his injuries, Max insists on driving the repaired truck during the escape. His support consists of the Gyro Captain, Pappagallo in a separate vehicle, three of the settlers on the outside of the armoured tanker, and the Feral Kid, who jumps on the truck as it is leaving. The marauders pursue the tanker, allowing the remaining settlers to flee their compound in a caravan of smaller vehicles after rigging the refinery to explode.

Pappagallo and the three settlers are killed and the Gyro Captain is shot down. Max turns the truck around and, as he is fighting with Wez, Humungus collides with the truck head on, killing Wez and himself. The truck rolls off the road and the surviving marauders survey the scene, only to abandon their chase when they see the tanker leaking sand and not gas. As Max carries the Feral Kid from the wrecked tanker, he inspects the sand pouring out. The Gyro Captain drives up and the two share a grin as Max realizes the tanker was a diversion the whole time. They rendezvous with the settlers, who transported the fuel in oil drums inside their vehicles.

The Gyro Captain succeeds Pappagallo as leader of the settlers and takes them north. The grown Feral Kid, &quot;Chief of the Great Northern Tribe,&quot; reveals in voice-over that he never saw &quot;the Road Warrior&quot; again.

==Cast==

* Mel Gibson as &quot;Mad Max&quot; Rockatansky, a former member of the Australian highway patrol (the Main Force Patrol, MFP) who, after a biker gang killed his family, left the force and hunted down and killed all of the gang members. The trauma of the events of &quot;Mad Max&quot; transformed him into an embittered &quot;shell of a man&quot;, but he still elects to assist the settlers with their plan in this film.
* Bruce Spence as The Gyro Captain, a wanderer who searches for fuel and supplies using a ramshackle old gyrocopter. He, too, decides to throw in his lot with the settlers and help defend their compound. Writing for &quot;Time&quot;, Richard Corliss called the Captain &quot;a deranged parody of the World War I aerial ace: scarecrow skinny, gaily clad, sporting a James Coburn smile with advanced caries&quot;.
* Mike Preston as Pappagallo, the idealistic leader of a group of settlers barricaded in an oil refinery. Even though the settlers&#x27; compound is besieged by a violent gang, Pappagallo &quot;carries the weight of his predicament with swaggering dignity.&quot; The novelization of the film expanded on Pappagallo&#x27;s history, describing him as a top executive for one of the &quot;7 Sisters&quot; major petroleum firms who lost his family in the war and escaped to the wastelands, where he would join up with other refugees and become a leader of their efforts to establish a new civilization.
* Max Phipps as The Toadie, the crier of Humungus&#x27;s gang and a classic sycophant.
* Vernon Wells as Wez, a mohawked, leather-clad biker who serves as Humungus&#x27;s lieutenant. Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called Wez the &quot;most evil of The Humungus&#x27;s followers...[a] huge brute who rides around on his bike, snarling psychotically.&quot; In a 1985 interview with Danny Peary, Miller said the characters of Wez and Max are near mirror images of each other. In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine listed Wez as the greatest movie henchman of all time.
* Kjell Nilsson as Lord Humungus, the violent, yet charismatic and articulate, leader of a &quot;vicious gang of post-holocaust, motorcycle-riding vandals&quot; who loot, rape, and kill the few remaining wasteland-dwellers. In the interview with Danny Peary, Miller posited that he thought the character &quot;was a former military officer who suffered severe facial burns&quot;, and that he &quot;might have served in the same outfit as his counterpart, Pappagallo.&quot;
* Emil Minty as The Feral Kid, an eight-year-old boy who lives in the wasteland near the oil refinery. He speaks only in growls and grunts, wears shorts and boots made from hide, and defends himself with a metal boomerang that he can catch using an improvised mail glove.
* Virginia Hey as Warrior Woman, a settler who initially distrusts Max.
* William Zappa as Zetta, a settler.
* Arkie Whiteley as The Captain&#x27;s Girl, a beautiful young settler who chooses to stay with her compatriots rather than escape with the Gyro Captain, prompting him to stay as well.
* Steven J. Spears as The Mechanic, a settler who is paraplegic.
* Syd Heylen as Curmudgeon, an elderly settler who wears a military helmet and decorations.
* Moira Claux as &quot;Big&quot; Rebecca, a settler who wields a bow and arrow and initially wants to take Humungus&#x27;s offer of safe passage if they abandon their compound.
* David Downer as Nathan, one of the settlers who leaves the compound to look for a truck to tow the oil tanker. He is wounded by some of Humungus&#x27;s bikers and dies shortly after Max brings him back to the refinery.
* David Slingsby as Quiet Man, a settler.
* Kristoffer Greaves as Mechanic&#x27;s Assistant, a settler.
* Max Fairchild as Broken Victim, a settler who is caught and tied to the front of Humungus&#x27;s car. Gibson and Fairchild are the only two actors who appear in both &quot;Mad Max&quot; and &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;, though Fairchild portrays a different character in each film.
* Tyler Coppin as Defiant Victim, a settler who is caught and tied to the front of Humungus&#x27;s car.
* Jerry O&#x27;Sullivan (credited as Jimmy Brown) as The Golden Youth, Wez&#x27;s companion, who is killed by the Feral Kid&#x27;s boomerang.

==Production==
===Development===
Following the release of &quot;Mad Max&quot;, director George Miller tried to develop a rock and roll movie, the working title of which was &quot;Roxanne&quot;. After working together on the novelization of &quot;Mad Max&quot;, Miller and Terry Hayes teamed up in Los Angeles to write &quot;Roxanne&quot;, but the script was ultimately shelved. Miller then became intrigued with the idea of returning to the world of &quot;Mad Max&quot;, as a larger budget would allow him to be more ambitious. He said: &quot;Making &quot;Mad Max&quot; was a very unhappy experience for me. I had absolutely no control over the final product&quot;, but &quot;There was strong pressure to make a sequel, and I felt we could do a better job with a second movie.&quot; Inspired by Joseph Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot; and the work of Carl Jung, as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa, Miller recruited Hayes to join the production as a scriptwriter. Brian Hannant also came on board as co-writer, first assistant director, and second unit director.

===Filming===

Principal photography took place over the course of twelve weeks in the winter of 1981 near Broken Hill, New South Wales. The scene where the Pursuit Special rolls over and explodes was shot at Wilangee Road near the Mundi Mundi Plains lookout, just outside of Silverton. Filming also took place at the Pinnacles, which is where the set of the oil refinery compound was constructed.

In one scene, stunt coordinator Guy Norris broke his femur when he flew off his motorcycle and his leg hit the car. His injury is visible in the released film.

===Music===

The musical score for &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; was composed and conducted by Australian composer Brian May, who had also composed the music for &quot;Mad Max&quot;. A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande in 1982.

===Censorship===
The original cut of the film was more bloody and violent, but it was cut down heavily to receive an &quot;M&quot; rating from Australian censors. Entire scenes and sequences were deleted completely, and others were edited. When the film was submitted to the MPAA in the United States, two additional scenes were shortened (the scene in which Wez pulls an arrow out of his arm and the one in which he pulls the boomerang out of the Golden Youth&#x27;s head). Although the version of the film that includes those scenes before they were trimmed down for the MPAA survives, no version without the previous deletions exists.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Mad Max 2&quot; was a commercial success, grossing A$10.8 million in Australia alone, which was double what &quot;Mad Max&quot; had earned in the country to become the highest-grossing Australian film at the Australian box office. Despite making more than its predecessor, however, &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; never held that record, because &quot;Gallipoli&quot; was released earlier in 1981 and grossed A$11.7 million in Australia.

In the United States, with a gross of US$23.6 million and theatrical rentals of $11 million, the film also outperformed &quot;Mad Max&quot;. When that film was released in the U.S. in 1982, it did not receive a proper release from its distributor, American International Pictures, as AIP was in the final stages of a change of ownership after being bought by Filmways, Inc. a year earlier, and its box office was affected. Warner Bros. decided to release &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; in the United States, but, recognising the first film was not well-known in North America (although it was becoming more popular through cable channel showings), they decided to change the name of the sequel to &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;. The advertising for the film, including print ads, trailers, and TV commercials, did not refer to the Max character at all and shied away from the fact that the film was a sequel. For the majority of American viewers, their first inkling of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; being a sequel to &quot;Mad Max&quot; was when they saw the black and white, archival footage from the first film during the prologue of the second. When Vestron Video later released &quot;Mad Max&quot; on home video, they capitalized by labeling it &quot;the thrilling predecessor to &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;&quot;.

Outside of the U.S., the film earned rentals of $25 million (including Australia), for a worldwide total of $36 million, making it the highest-grossing Australian film worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews and is regarded by many critics as one of the best films of 1981. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on reviews from 62 critics, with an average rating of 8.40/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;&quot;The Road Warrior&quot; is everything a bigger-budgeted &quot;Mad Max&quot; sequel should be: bigger, faster, louder, but definitely not dumber.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 77 out of 100 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, praised its &quot;skillful filmmaking&quot;, and called it &quot;a film of pure action, of kinetic energy&quot;, which is &quot;one of the most relentlessly aggressive movies ever made&quot;. While Ebert pointed out the film does not develop its &quot;vision of a violent future world ... with characters and dialogue&quot;, and uses only the &quot;barest possible bones of a plot&quot;, he praised its action sequences. Ebert called the climactic chase sequence &quot;unbelievably well-sustained&quot; and stated that the &quot;special effects and stunts ... are spectacular&quot;, creating a &quot;frightening, sometimes disgusting, and (if the truth be told) exhilarating&quot; effect.

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby wrote: &quot;Never has a film&#x27;s vision of the post-nuclear-holocaust world seemed quite as desolate and as brutal, or as action-packed and sometimes as funny as in George Miller&#x27;s apocalyptic &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;, an extravagant film fantasy that looks like a sadomasochistic comic book come to life&quot;. Writing for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Charles Michener praised Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;easy, unswaggering masculinity&quot;, saying that &quot;[his] hint of Down Under humor may be quintessentially Australian but is also the stuff of an international male star&quot;.

Gary Arnold, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote: &quot;While he seems to let triumph slip out of his grasp, Miller is still a prodigious talent, capable of a scenic and emotional amplitude that recalls the most stirring attributes in great action directors like Kurosawa, Peckinpah and Leone&quot;. Pauline Kael called &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; a &quot;mutant&quot; film that was &quot;sprung from virtually all action genres&quot;, creating &quot;one continuous spurt of energy&quot; by using &quot;jangly, fast editing&quot;, but criticised Miller&#x27;s &quot;attempt to tap into the universal concept of the hero&quot;, stating that this attempt &quot;makes the film joyless&quot;, &quot;sappy&quot;, and &quot;sentimental&quot;.

Richard Scheib called &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; &quot;one of the few occasions where a sequel makes a dramatic improvement in quality over its predecessor.&quot; He called it a &quot;kinetic comic-book of a film&quot; and an &quot;exhilarating non-stop rollercoaster ride of a film that contains some of the most exciting stunts and car crashes ever put on screen.&quot; Scheib stated that the film transforms the &quot;post-holocaust landscape into the equivalent of a Western frontier&quot;, such that &quot;Mel Gibson&#x27;s Max could just as easily be Clint Eastwood&#x27;s tight-lipped Man With No Name&quot; helping protect &quot;decent frightened folk&quot; from the &quot;marauding Redskins&quot;.

Christopher John reviewed &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; in &quot;Ares Magazine&quot; #13 and commented that &quot;Its taut scripting, exceptional performances, and pulse-pounding pacing, which leaves an audience breathless, combined to make it one of the best SF films of the year. It also has the courage to show what the face of death &quot;really&quot; looks like. Mel Gibson&#x27;s portrayal of Max is hard, bitter and realistic; he is neither hero nor coward, but a man caught up in a mad future which he confronts unafraid.&quot; &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; says &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;, &quot;with all its comic-strip energy and vividness ... is exploitation cinema at its most inventive.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 24th Australian Film Institute Awards, the film won Best Direction, Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Original Music Score; it received the most nominations and wins of any film at the ceremony, but it was not nominated for Best Film. At the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films&#x27; 10th Saturn Awards, the film won the award for Best International Film and generated nominations for Best Director, Best Actor (Mel Gibson), Best Supporting Actor (Bruce Spence), Best Writing, and Best Costumes. Additionally, the film won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Foreign Film and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and George Miller won the Grand Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival for his work on the film.

===Legacy===
The film&#x27;s depiction of a post-apocalyptic future has so widely influenced other filmmakers and science fiction writers that its gritty &quot;junkyard society of the future look ... is almost taken for granted in the modern science-fiction action film.&quot; The dystopian, apocalyptic, and post-apocalyptic themes and imagery in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series of films have inspired some artists to recreate the look and feel of some aspects of the series in their work, and fan clubs and &quot;road warrior&quot;-themed activities continue into the 21st century.

In 2008, &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; was selected by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine as one of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. Similarly, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; 93rd on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot; in 1999 and 41st on its updated list of the &quot;All-Time 100 Greatest Films&quot; in 2013, and the publication ranked the character of Mad Max 11th on its list of &quot;The All Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture&quot;. In 2016, James Charisma of &quot;Playboy&quot; ranked the film 11th on a list of &quot;15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than the Originals&quot;.

A museum dedicated to &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; was established in 2010 in the small town of Silverton (which is 25 kilometres from Broken Hill in New South Wales) by Adrian and Linda Bennett, who had built a collection of &quot;Mad Max&quot; props and memorabilia after moving to Silverton.

<doc id="262466" wikidata="Q355374" url="?curid=262466" title="Ian Hill">
<text>Ian Hill (born 20 January 1952) is an English musician, best known as the bassist of the British heavy metal band Judas Priest. Along with lead guitarist Glenn Tipton, he is the only member who has appeared on all of the band&#x27;s studio albums.

==Judas Priest==

In 1970, together with schoolmate K. K. Downing, Hill joined heavy metal band Judas Priest. He has been playing bass with the band ever since and is now the longest-serving member of the band, following Downing&#x27;s departure in 2011.

During the early years of the band, he played bass by finger-picking, but since the album &quot;Killing Machine&quot; he has played with a pick. 

Hill is credited with playing bass on all of Judas Priest&#x27;s albums, but on &quot;Painkiller&quot; bass was double-tracked with Don Airey&#x27;s bass on a Minimoog synthesizer. Hill is responsible for bringing Rob Halford into Judas Priest. The two met while Hill was dating Halford&#x27;s sister and mentioned that he needed a new vocalist for his band. Halford accepted, leaving his previous band Hiroshima, and brought along drummer John Hinch, who would later be dropped by the band after one album due to &quot;musical inadequacy&quot;, according to Judas Priest&#x27;s website.

When Hill was asked about his reaction to the 2001 film &quot;Rock Star&quot;, which was originally inspired by the real-life story of Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, a singer in a Judas Priest tribute band who was chosen to replace singer Rob Halford when he left the band, in an interview with &quot;PopMatters&quot; magazine, Hill responded &quot;Well, it was a true work of fiction, you know? When we heard about the production company were going to make a movie based, as far as we knew, about Ripper joining the band we offered our help. We said &#x27;If there&#x27;s anything you want to know, talk to us at the time.&#x27; And certainly our communication was cut off and that was it and they went off on their own tangent.&quot; Hill added &quot;I mean, I quite enjoyed the movie. [laughs] It was entertaining, you know?&quot; Hill was quoted as saying &quot;It had nothing to do with Rob Halford, Ripper Owens and Judas Priest, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with that, whatsoever. It was fiction. Apart from the fact that &#x27;Local Boy Makes Good&#x27;? That was the only true aspect of the movie.&quot; Hill was quick to add &quot;I watched it once. I don&#x27;t have the urge to watch it again. [laughs]&quot;

==Personal life==
Hill learned how to play the double bass from his father, a bass player for local jazz acts. His father died when he was fifteen. Hill married Rob Halford&#x27;s sister, Sue, in 1976 and they divorced in 1984. Together they have a son, Alex, who was born in 1980. Hill lived in Florida while he was married to his second wife, Letitia. They had a daughter with the same name. He met his present wife, Jean, in 1999, and married in 2006. The couple resides in Staffordshire.

He is a supporter of West Bromwich Albion F.C.

Hill is featured in the 2024 documentary &quot;Cover Your Ears&quot; produced by Prairie Coast Films and directed by Sean Patrick Shaul, discussing the subliminal message trial Judas Priest were involved with.

== Musical equipment ==

In the early years of Judas Priest, Hill played a 1970s Fender Jazz Bass, switching to Hamer in the mid-1980s. Since the late 1980s, Hill has played Spector basses. Spector currently produce an Ian Hill signature bass guitar, based on Hill&#x27;s NS-2 and fitted with a narrower neck, with an optional tuning of BEAD. He plays using a nylon flatpick of 0.75 mm thickness.

While Hill has used a wide range of different amplifiers through his career, he has been using SWR products since the late 1990s. His current rig consists of two SWR SM1500 amplifiers and four SWR TRIAD cabinets.
During the &quot;Jugulator&quot; and &quot;Demolition&quot; recording sessions, Hill used a five-string Spector bass to access the lower registers needed through the use of down tuned guitars by Tipton and Downing.

<text>Fresno Yosemite International Airport is a joint military–public airport in Fresno, California, United States. It is the primary commercial airport for the San Joaquin Valley and three national parks: Yosemite, Sequoia and Kings Canyon. It offers scheduled passenger flights to several major airline hubs in the United States and international service to Mexico. The facility opened in June 1942 as Hammer Field, a military airfield. The airport is owned and operated by the city of Fresno and operates two runways on a property spanning . Its airport code &quot;FAT&quot; stands for Fresno Air Terminal, a former name for the airport. 

The airport has seen double-digit growth in its passenger traffic every year since 2018 (except 2020 due to the pandemic). , the passenger terminal is undergoing a significant expansion project to expand the size of the security screening area, add new gates, and build a new international arrivals facility. 

Due to its central location within the state, the airport is home to several military, law enforcement, firefighting, and medical air units. The Fresno Air National Guard Base on the southeast corner of the airport is home to the 144th Fighter Wing of the California Air National Guard. The Fresno Air Attack Base on the eastern side of the airport supports aerial firefighting aircraft. Other government and military operators with facilities at the airport include the California Army National Guard, the California Highway Patrol, the Fresno County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the Fresno Police Department.

Fresno is home to a large operations base for SkyWest Airlines, the nation&#x27;s largest regional airline.

== History ==
=== Military beginnings ===
The Fresno Yosemite International Airport opened as a military airfield in June 1942, just six months after Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, leading the United States to enter World War II. The new airfield was named Hammer Field and was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a training facility for the new pilots of the Fourth Air Force. It had a single northwest/southeast oriented runway with a length of 7,200 feet (now runway 11L/29R).

Night fighter training, using Northrop P-61s, was moved to Hammer Field in January 1944, initially with the 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group, replaced by the 319th Wing in May 1944. Training for the Bell P-59 Airacomet was added to the 319th mission in 1944, as well, confirmed Col. Ralph H. Snavely, commanding officer of the 319th Wing.

At the time, civil and commercial aviation used Chandler Field that had opened in November 1929. Chandler is west of downtown Fresno, on a small site. Less than a decade after it opened, it was clear that the small runway at Chandler would not be able to accommodate coming larger airliners.

=== Conversion to civil use ===
After World War II, Hammer Field was inactivated by the Army Air Forces, and the city of Fresno saw an opportunity to use the site to create a commercial airport much larger than Chandler Field. In 1946, the War Assets Administration reallocated the property to the city, and the construction of a passenger terminal on the northeast side of the airfield was immediately begun. In 1948, the newly renamed Fresno Air Terminal (FAT) opened. Trans World Airlines (TWA) and United Airlines flights to San Francisco/Oakland and Los Angeles moved from Chandler Field to the newly opened airport. Chandler Field was retained by the city of Fresno as a reliever airport and continues to operate as the Fresno Chandler Executive Airport.

Strategic Air Command facilities for Convair B-36 operations were initially proposed for “Hammer Air Force Base,” but objections from the City of Fresno led them to be changed to Travis Air Force Base instead. The Fresno upgrade was projected to cost $22.3 million.

The California Air National Guard moved to the airport in the 1950s and established the Fresno Air National Guard Base on the southeast corner of the property. The guard also built munition storage bunkers along the northern edge of the airport grounds. The 194th Fighter Squadron moved to the facility in late 1954, followed by the 144th Fighter Wing in 1957. As the guard moved in, a second parallel runway (11R/29L) was constructed and opened to traffic in 1956.

Construction started on a new, larger passenger terminal in 1959 on the south side of the field. The building was a long, simple shape that housed a baggage claim area, a central lobby, and a ticketing area. The $1.5 million terminal had long walls of glass for the baggage claim and the ticketing areas, which book-ended the central lobby of solid masonry block which bears a venetian glass mosaic called &quot;Sky and Ground&quot; from Raymond Rice. From the central lobby, passengers used a tunnel to reach the open-air, remote concourse where they boarded planes from ground level. The terminal opened on March 28, 1962 and shortly after received an award from the San Joaquin Valley Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Although renovated, the original terminal building is still in use today for the same functions that it was designed for. The current air traffic control tower was built around the same time as the terminal and opened in 1961.

Pacific Air Lines was first to schedule jets to Fresno, with Boeing 727-100s in 1966. United was the dominant carrier at the airport throughout the mid-1970s. At the airlines&#x27; peak, United operated daily DC-8s jet service to Denver, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Hughes Airwest and PSA jets also served the airport at this time.

The first significant expansion to the passenger terminal came in 1978 when a concourse was built straight out from the central lobby. This building, unlike the original remote concourse, was enclosed and climate-controlled.

The airport saw significant down-gauging of flights following airline deregulation in 1978. By 1983, the airport mainly saw turboprop service from smaller carriers and United Airlines ended intrastate flights from Fresno. Delta Air Lines operated mainline jets to Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and Reno in the mid-1990s, but by 1999, the only mainline jet flights remaining at Fresno was the American Airlines service to Dallas/Fort Worth.

In 1996, the airport&#x27;s name was changed from Fresno Air Terminal to Fresno Yosemite International Airport to attract out-of-state and international visitors to Yosemite National Park to the airport. Despite the new name, scheduled international commercial flights would not begin operating in Fresno for nearly a decade. At the time, airport managers petitioned the FAA for a new identifier code to replace FAT, which they said carries a negative connotation and no longer matched the initials of the airport. The request was denied, with the FAA reaffirming its long-standing policy to only issue a new identifier code when an airport is physically relocated. In recent years, airport managers have embraced the FAT identifier code, naming a major expansion project “FATforward.”

Fresno has been the headquarters for a few airlines throughout its history. In the mid-1980s, Far West Airlines was founded in Fresno and used the airport as a small intrastate hub serving Burbank, Los Angeles, Modesto, Oakland, Orange County, Sacramento, and San Jose. Air 21 was founded in Fresno in January 1994 and operated service between several western cities before ceasing operations in January 1997. Allegiant Air was founded in Fresno in January 1997 with a single DC-9, offering charter flights to Tahoe and other destinations. By 1999, it expanded to three planes serving Las Vegas, Burbank, and South Lake Tahoe. After declaring bankruptcy in 2000, its headquarters moved to a Las Vegas suburb under new leadership.

=== Expansion and remodeling ===

At the turn of the 21st century, the city began a series of projects to expand and remodel the passenger terminal. The first and most notable project was the expansion of the boarding areas. The project, designed by DMJM Aviation, extended the concourse further, creating a new two-level section with six jet bridges. Before this project, passengers boarded all planes using stairs or ramps. When completed in 2002, the new concourse building received praise for its design and was named one of the top 10 projects in Fresno Architecture for the decade, with critics commending the use of steel and the curved glass facade.

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility for international arrivals was added in early 2006, giving federal officials space to check passports and complete customs work. Completion of that facility allowed Fresno to begin receiving scheduled international commercial flights. The first international service started in April 2006 with Mexicana operating flights between Fresno and Mexico City with an intermediate stop in Guadalajara.
With the new concourse extension and new international arrivals facility completed, portions of the original 1960s terminal building were given a major renovation. The project was designed by CSHQA and completed in several phases between 2006 and 2010. While keeping the facility operational, nearly every part of the building was updated, including the baggage claim area, security checkpoint, central lobby, ticketing area, and low-level concourse. The centerpiece of the project was “Sequoiascape,” a public art display in the central terminal lobby that depicts a life-size replica sequoia forest, reflecting the airport&#x27;s role as a gateway to the nearby national parks. The giant trees appear to be supporting the roof of the terminal. They are surrounded by fallen logs, foliage, and the split rail fencing and granite curbs that visitors would see at the region’s national parks.

A consolidated rental car facility opened at the airport in 2009. The $22 million project allows customers of most rental car companies to pick up and drop off vehicles just outside the terminal. The project also included the construction of maintenance buildings and storage lots on a nearby 11-acre site.

Direct international service from Fresno briefly ended in August 2010 when Mexicana went bankrupt. International service resumed, with more flights, less than a year later when both Aeroméxico and Volaris added service between Fresno and Guadalajara in April 2011.

The secondary runway (11R/29L) was widened, lengthened and strengthened in a $30 million project completed in October 2012.

Southwest Airlines began serving the airport on April 25, 2021, the first time the airline provided services at Fresno&#x27;s airport, with daily flights to Las Vegas and Denver.

The airport added a 917-space, four-level parking garage in November 2021. The project cost $32 million.

== Future expansion ==

Fresno Yosemite International Airport is currently working on a $127 million expansion project that will make several changes to the terminal, including the addition of a new concourse building with two new gates that can be used for both domestic and international flights, enlarging the screening area for arriving international passengers, expanding the luggage-handling and sorting area for outbound flights, new shopping/dining areas, and expanding the Transportation Security Administration security checkpoint.

Airport managers initially anticipated that construction on the terminal expansion would begin in early 2021 and be operational before the summer 2022 travel season. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the process was delayed, and construction did not start until spring 2023 and is now scheduled to be completed in fall 2025. The air traffic control tower is also expected to be replaced by 2024 in a $30 million project.

The airport&#x27;s primary runway (11L/29R) is scheduled to be reconstructed between 2025 and 2027, a $45 million project.

== Airline service ==
SkyWest carries about 34% of the passenger traffic at Fresno, more than any other carrier. The regional airline operates under contract with mainline partners as American Eagle, Alaska Airlines, Delta Connection and United Express. SkyWest has a maintenance and overnight parking facility on the east side of the airfield with 21 aircraft positions and an approximately hangar. SkyWest also uses Fresno as a crew base for pilots and flight attendants.

Airlines that operate narrow-body aircraft from either the Airbus A320 family or the Boeing 737 family of jets include Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines. 

Aeroméxico and Volaris both operate international service between Fresno and Guadalajara, Mexico&#x27;s second-largest city and a major airline hub in the country. Additionally, Volaris also operates service to Morelia, the capital of and largest city in Mexico&#x27;s Michoacán state and León, the largest city in Mexico&#x27;s Guanajuato state. Direct international service from Fresno began on April 1, 2006, and are now some of the busiest flights from the airport. As of 2016, international service on Aeroméxico and Volaris accounted for about 6% of all flights to Fresno but carried more than 13% of all passengers flying to the airport, a combined total of almost 201,000 people.

United Airlines is the carrier with the longest continuous operation out of Fresno Yosemite International Airport, which began serving the airport on its opening day alongside Trans World Airlines (TWA) which would later merge into American Airlines.

== Infrastructure ==
Fresno Yosemite International Airport covers at an elevation of above mean sea level, with two paved asphalt runways. The primary runway, 11L/29R, is and the secondary runway, 11R/29L, .

In 2022, 2.1 million passengers passed through the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, representing an 11% increase from the previous record set in 2021, when 1.94 million passengers flew in and out of the airport, and breaking the record for most passengers, previously set in 2019.

For the year ending February 28, the airport had 92,361 aircraft operations, an average of 253 per day: 54% general aviation, 26% scheduled commercial, 11% air taxi and 8% military. At that time, there were 187 aircraft based at the airport: 100 single-engine, 33 multi-engine, 24 military, 11 jet and 19 helicopter.

== Military and government operations ==
The 144th Fighter Wing of the California Air National Guard is based at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport. The California Army National Guard also has an Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depot (AVCRAD) at the airport. The depot performs high-level maintenance and repair of Army aircraft. Its jurisdiction covers a 15-state region in the Western United States.

The United States Forest Service, Sierra National Forest and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) jointly operate the Fresno Air Attack Base at the airport for fighting forest fires with aerial tankers. The air attack base has a command center and four loading pits where fire retardant is pumped into aircraft with the capacity to load up to 300,000 gallons each day.

Other government operators with facilities at the airport include the California Highway Patrol (CHP), the Fresno County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the Fresno Police Department.

== Ground transportation and access ==

The airport is located about north of California State Route 180, with vehicles using Peach Avenue to connect between the airport and the highway. California State Route 180 connects to all of the other freeways in the Fresno area: California State Route 41, California State Route 99, and California State Route 168. Yosemite National Park can be accessed by California State Route 41 and Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park can be accessed by California State Route 180.
The city of Fresno offers paid on-site parking in a 900-space parking garage south of the airport terminal, a large lot south of the terminal, and several smaller lots east of the terminal. A separate cell phone waiting lot located on the southeast corner of the airport property has stalls designated for drivers waiting for arriving passengers.
Fresno Area Express (FAX) operates two public transit bus routes to the airport, each with half-hourly service. Route 26 Palm / Butler runs between the airport and North Fresno via Southeast and Downtown Fresno (where passengers may transfer to other FAX routes). Route 39 FYI/Clinton runs between the airport and West Fresno.

The City of Visalia operates the V-LINE bus between the airport and the Visalia Transit Center (where passengers can connect to Visalia Transit routes) and the Visalia Airport (which offers V-LINE passengers free long-term parking for up to ten days).
The airport offers a consolidated rental car facility at the terminal&#x27;s west end. Nine rental car companies have passenger service counters inside the terminal near the baggage claim area, and up to 400 cars can be parked in a lot just west of the terminal building. The 11-acre rental car facility opened in 2009 and was built at a cost of $22 million.
The airport has covered bicycle parking racks inside the parking garage south of the terminal. Nearby roads East Clinton Way and East McKinley Avenue have Class II bike lanes (on-roadway, separated) and they connect to the Class I bike path (off-roadway) that runs alongside North Clovis Avenue.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On December 14, 1994, a private jet on a military training mission, attempting to land at Fresno, crashed onto a street and skidded into an apartment complex, killing both pilots and injuring 21 people on the ground. The Learjet 35, piloted by two civilians and belonging to a Georgia-based company, Phoenix Air Group, was contracted by the US Air Force to provide training for California Air National Guard pilots. The plane had been involved in a war game with an F-16 fighter jet and was on its way back to the airport when the flight crew declared an emergency due to engine fire indications. They directed the plane toward their requested runway but the aircraft continued past the airport. On radio transmissions, the flight crew was heard attempting to diagnose the emergency conditions and control the aircraft, until the plane crashed with its landing gear down about southwest of the airport. It then plowed into an apartment complex and exploded in a fireball. Twelve apartment units in two buildings were destroyed or substantially damaged by the impact or the subsequent fire. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable causes of the accident were improperly installed electrical wiring that led to an in-flight fire which damaged the aircraft&#x27;s systems causing a loss of control and improper maintenance and inspection of the aircraft.
* On September 13, 2015, a McDonnell Douglas MD-87 jetliner converted for aerial firefighting use as an air tanker operated by Erickson had an engine failure after taking off from the airport. Pieces of the engine struck a car, damaging it. The aircraft was able to return to the airport safely.

<text>Glen Charles Cook (born July 9, 1944) is an American writer of fantasy and science fiction, known for &quot;The Black Company&quot; and &quot;Garrett P.I.&quot; fantasy series.

==Biography==
Cook was born in New York City. Cook served in the United States Navy from 1962 to 1972 and specifically was attached, for a time, to a Marine Force Recon unit, the 3rd Marine Battalion. During his time attached to the Force Recon Unit, Cook participated in what he called &quot;practice combat&quot;, and left active duty, &quot;a month before [the unit] shipped out to Viet Nam&quot;. He later worked his way through college. Cook began to write in earnest while working for General Motors at an auto assembly plant in a job which was &quot;hard to learn, but [involved] almost no mental effort&quot;, writing as many as three books per year.

Cook wrote &quot;The Black Company&quot;, a novel published by Tor Fantasy, in May 1984. It began a gritty fantasy series of the same name (or Chronicles of the Black Company) following an elite mercenary unit through several decades of its history. As of 2016, it comprises the novels published in three subseries 1984–85, 1989–90, and 1996–2000, plus recent short fiction. It has become something of a cult classic, especially among current and former members of the military. When asked about the series&#x27; popularity among soldiers, Cook replied: &quot;The characters act like the guys actually behave. It doesn&#x27;t glorify war; it&#x27;s just people getting on with the job. The characters are real soldiers. They&#x27;re not soldiers as imagined by people who&#x27;ve never been in the service. That&#x27;s why service guys like it.&quot; Cook is also known for his Garrett P.I. series, which tells the haphazard adventures of hardboiled detective Garrett, and for his Dread Empire series.

<doc id="262473" wikidata="Q1510001" url="?curid=262473" title="Gerald R. Ford International Airport">
<text>Grand Rapids Gerald R. Ford International Airport is a commercial airport in Cascade Township, approximately southeast of Grand Rapids, Michigan, United States. The facility is owned by the Kent County Board of Commissioners and managed by an independent authority. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021 categorized it as a small hub primary commercial service facility.

The facility opened as the Kent County Airport and later became Kent County International Airport. In December 1999, the airport was renamed for Gerald R. Ford, the 40th Vice President and the 38th President of the United States. Ford represented the Grand Rapids area in the United States House of Representatives from 1949 to 1973.

, GRR had flights to 33 airports in the United States. It is the largest commercial airport in the West Michigan region, and the second-largest airport in Michigan after Detroit Metropolitan Airport. GRR covers .

==History==
Grand Rapids&#x27; first airport broke ground in November 1919, south of downtown. This was eight years after the area witnessed its first landing, a Wright biplane at Comstock Park State Fairgrounds on September 10, 1911. The airport was operated by the Kent County Board of Supervisors.

The first scheduled air service in the United States was between Grand Rapids and Dearborn on a Ford-Stout monoplane named &quot;Miss Grand Rapids&quot;, which started July 26, 1926.

In 1938–39, the Works Progress Administration made improvements including adding new runways, runway widening, fencing, sodding, lighting, remodeling the administration building, and constructing a new restaurant.

Circa 1940, the airport extended between 32nd and 36th Streets, from Jefferson Avenue east to the railroad; the west end was soon expanded south to just north of Himes Street and in the 1950s runway 18/36 was extended to 5700’ and reached south to 44th Street.

In 1959, the county began construction on the present airport in Cascade Township, several miles east of the first airport. The new airport opened November 23, 1963, and was dedicated June 6, 1964; it had a runway designated 08/26 and a designated 18/36. The first scheduled jet was a United Airlines Boeing 737-200 on April 28, 1968, from Chicago O&#x27;Hare. The aircraft, N9003U, was named &quot;City of Grand Rapids&quot;. In 1968, the only scheduled non-stops beyond Michigan were to Chicago and Green Bay.

On January 27, 1977, the Board of Commissioners renamed Kent County Airport as Kent County International Airport with the opening of a U.S. Customs Service Office in the main terminal building.

In 1997, the board added the runway 17/35 to allow continued operations during a $32 million reconstruction of runway 8R/26L, completed in 2001. It completed a passenger terminal renovation in 2000 at a cost of approximately $50 million.

In 2004, the airport served more than 2 million passengers for the first time in a year. In 2010, it broke the 2004 record with almost 2.2 million passengers, as increase of over 23% from 2009.

On January 2, 2007, a U.S. Air Force Boeing VC-25 jet carried the remains of former president Gerald Ford to his namesake airport as part of funeral services culminating in burial at his presidential museum in Grand Rapids the next day.

From April 2010 through October 2011, the airport was a focus city for Allegiant Air.

Air Canada operated the airport&#x27;s only international flights to Toronto Pearson International Airport from July 2008 until September 2013. It was the airline&#x27;s second attempt at service between the two markets.

Delta Air Lines operates Boeing 757-200s seasonally between Grand Rapids and Atlanta during the winter, making it the largest aircraft to serve GRR.

Allegiant Air announced in mid-January 2019 that they would be making the airport one of Allegiant&#x27;s 16 focus cities once again. After dropping GRR as a focus city in 2011, Allegiant is upgrading GRR again to a focus city adding Nashville, Tennessee, and Savannah-Hilton Head, Georgia, as new routes. Allegiant would later add other new destinations such as Los Angeles, Boston, and Newark.

In 2013 the airport began building a natural treatment system to improve stormwater management practices and safeguard the waters of the Thornapple River. The new, innovative system will include a biological treatment system that will improve collection of stormwater runoff and naturally remove sediments and pollutants before sending the water to the Thornapple River, which flows just east of the airfield.

The airport eliminated the two separate security checkpoints in each concourse and created one consolidated checkpoint in the grand hall area to help traffic flow much faster and to be prepared for future growth. In addition, the grand hall area and the entrance area to the airport was renovated with more shopping and dining options. Work began in late 2015 and completed in June 2017.

The airport began construction of a roof over the parking deck in March 2015 to increase close-in, covered, long-term parking. The roof covers most of the fourth floor, though some spaces on the fourth and third floors remain uncovered due to airfield sight-line requirements for the FAA control tower. The garage roof was completed in November 2015 and will allow use of the fourth floor spaces during heavy snow.

In 2016, the airport partnered with the Cascade Community Foundation on plans to renovate the current outdoor viewing area to make it a larger, more inviting place for people to relax. The renovated park opened in May 2017.

In November 2018 the airport began the phase II of the Gateway Transformation Project, reconstructing the baggage claim, check-in, and front of house areas. It has completed the apron reconstruction, adding new pavement to the apron and taxiway areas.

==Facilities==
Gerald R. Ford International Airport has two parallel east-west runways and one north-south runway. Along with cargo and general aviation facilities, the airport has a passenger terminal with two concourses: A has 15 gates and B has eight. Runways 08R/26L and runway 17/35 have ILS. The airport also has a general aviation runway north of the main 08R/26L runway.

In September 2017, the airport celebrated the opening of phase one of their Gateway Transformation, a 59,000 square foot addition onto the passenger terminal facility that included a consolidated passenger security screening checkpoint, a new Marketplace with expanded retail and food &amp; beverage offerings, new business centers and lounges, and much more. Concourse A&#x27;s tenants are Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines. Southwest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air occupy Concourse B. All gates have climate-controlled jetways.

The airport is served by Signature Flight Support, which operates an FBO on the field. Besides fuel, the facility provides general maintenance, aircraft parking, courtesy and rental cars, conference rooms, pilot supplies, a crew lounge, snooze rooms, and more.

When new baggage screening regulations were introduced by the Transportation Security Administration in 2002, the airport was the first in the nation to conduct trials on the new screening machines. The baggage processing areas were too small for the machines so they were placed in the passenger lobby.

The airport is also home to the West Michigan Aviation Academy, a public charter high school that focuses on aviation, STEM, and robotics educations. The school offers a fleet of Cessna 172 aircraft for flight training, allows students to build a Carbon Cub EX2 plane, and has a Redbird LD flight simulator.

==Planned development==
In late August 2019, the airport made an announcement about its next focus, Project Elevate. This phase of airport development, consisting of three major projects, includes a $90 million expansion and extension of Concourse A to encompass 8 more gates, a $50 million relocation and construction of a new air traffic control tower as well as a $25 million federal inspection station to facilitate departures and arrivals of direct international flights. As of summer, 2024, the concourse A expansion is mostly complete with some of the new tenants open including only the second airport Freddy&#x27;s (also the only ones with a breakfast menu) in an airport and some other yet-to-open spaces including a Firehouse Subs and a Priority Pass club lounge.

Project Elevate expanded with some additional projects that include a $156 million rental car facility and additional parking in a new ramp that was announced in 2023 and is expected to be completed by late 2025. And in April 2024, it was announced there would also be an $135 million Terminal Enhancement Project included as well expected to be completed by 2027 

==Accidents and incidents==
*On May 9, 2008, a Cessna 208 Caravan operating for Federal Express by CSA Air crashed just north of Grand Rapids. The pilot was not injured and there were no injuries on the ground.
*On September 6, 2010, a Cessna 210 Centurion that departed from Grand Rapids made an emergency landing in a field due to an engine failure. The aircraft was on a training flight at the time of impact. The probable cause of the accident was found to be a fatigue failure of the crankshaft due to the loss of engine case through-bold torque. Both occupants were uninjured.
*On October 29, 2012, a Delta Air Lines McDonnell Douglas MD-88 diverted to the airport after an engine issue. The engine was shut off and the plane with 95 passengers was able to land safely.
*On January 9, 2022, a private aircraft returned to the airport due to a landing gear problem. It landed safely back at the airport.
*On July 8, 2022, an American Airlines flight en route from Chicago to Buffalo, New York diverted to Grand Rapids due to smoke in the cockpit. The plane landed safely and there were no injuries.
*On December 16, 2022, a Delta Air Lines Airbus A320 departing Grand Rapids for Minneapolis–Saint Paul returned shortly after takeoff following an engine failure. The aircraft landed safely and the 147 passengers and crew were uninjured.
*On December 9, 2023, a small white and black Cessna Citation experienced an engine malfunction and safely returned to the airport.

<text>Melanie Jayne Chisholm (born 12 January 1974), known professionally as Melanie C or Mel C, is an English singer and songwriter. She rose to fame in the mid-1990s as a member of the pop group the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Sporty Spice. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, the Spice Girls are the best-selling female group of all time. The group went on an indefinite hiatus in 2000, before reuniting for a greatest hits album (2007) and two concert tours: the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019). She is known for her unique and distinctive tone and her vocal ability.

Chisholm began a solo career in late 1998 on the single &quot;When You&#x27;re Gone&quot; with Canadian rock singer Bryan Adams. She signed with Virgin Records to release her debut solo studio album &quot;Northern Star&quot; (1999). After the release of her second studio album, &quot;Reason&quot; (2003), she parted ways with Virgin Records and founded her own record company, Red Girl Records. Her third studio album, &quot;Beautiful Intentions&quot;, (2005), stands as her most successful album to date. It spent 9 weeks at number one in Portugal and spawned international hit singles. She continued to release albums in the following years, including &quot;This Time&quot; (2007), &quot;The Sea&quot; (2011), &quot;Stages&quot; (2012), &quot;Version of Me&quot; (2016), and &quot;Melanie C&quot; (2020).

Chisholm is the recipient of numerous accolades, including three World Music Awards, five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, eight Billboard special awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award, ten ASCAP awards, one Juno Award and her hit single &quot;I Turn to You&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for the Hex Hector&#x27;s remix. She has sold over 130 million records in her career and has earned over 335 worldwide certifications, including 44 silver, gold, and platinum certifications as a solo artist.

In 2009, Chisholm made her stage debut in the West End musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Laurence Olivier Award. Her autobiography, &quot;Who I Am: My Story&quot;, was released in 2022.

==Early life==
Melanie Jayne Chisholm was born on 12 January 1974 in Whiston, Lancashire, the daughter of singer Joan Tuffley Chisholm O&#x27;Neill (who also worked as a secretary and personal assistant), and Otis Elevator Company fitter, Alan William Chisholm. Her parents married in 1971 and separated in 1978, when Melanie was four years old. Her mother remarried and had more children, one of whom is racing driver Paul O&#x27;Neill. Melanie grew up in Widnes, Cheshire, attending Brookvale Junior School in nearby Runcorn and Fairfield High School in Widnes. She studied for a diploma in singing, dancing, and musical theatre at the Doreen Bird College of Performing Arts in London, leaving just short of completing her three-year course and later gaining teaching qualifications in tap and modern theatre dance with the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.

==Career==
===1994–2000: Spice Girls===

In 1994, Chisholm (along with Melanie Brown, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Adams) responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot; magazine placed by Chris and Bob Herbert, who were looking to form a new girl group which would later become the Spice Girls. Around 400 women who answered the ad went to Dance Works studios. Chisholm, Brown, Halliwell, and Adams were originally chosen as the members of the group, which became a quintet with the addition of Emma Bunton. Insecure about the lack of a contract and frustrated by the direction of Chris and Bob Herbert&#x27;s Heart Management, the group severed ties with the Herberts. In 1995, they toured record labels in London and Los Angeles and finally signed a deal with Virgin. Their debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;, was a huge worldwide commercial success, peaked at number 1 in more than 17 countries across the world, and was certified multi-platinum in 27 countries. Conceptually, the album centred on the idea of Girl Power, and during that time was compared to Beatlemania. In total the album sold 30 million copies worldwide, becoming the biggest-selling album in music history by a girl group and one of the most successful albums of all time. The first single, &quot;Wannabe&quot; reached number 1 in 37 countries, and their subsequent singles – &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot; – all peaked at number 1 in the UK.

In 1997, they released their second album, &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, with the two first singles &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and &quot;Too Much&quot;, that entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1, making it the group&#x27;s all consecutive number 1 hit single, a record of musical groups all time. The album was a global best seller, selling 20 million copies worldwide. The group also starred in their own film, &quot;Spiceworld: The Movie&quot;, which grossed $100 million at the box office worldwide and became the second most watched movie of the year. The next single, &quot;Stop&quot;, peaked at two, breaking the sequence of number 1s, their only single to not reach the top of the charts. &quot;Viva Forever&quot;, another number 1, was the last single before Halliwell&#x27;s departure from the group in May 1998. With four members, the group released &quot;Goodbye&quot;, before Christmas in 1998 and when it topped the UK Singles Chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number-one – equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. On 30 November, Canadian artist Bryan Adams, released &quot;When You&#x27;re Gone&quot; with featured vocals of Chisholm, her debut solo project. The song peaked at number 3 on the UK Singles Chart, spent 15 weeks in the top 40 and received the platinum certification.

===1999–2003: &quot;Northern Star&quot; and &quot;Reason&quot;===
In 1999, Chisholm signed with Virgin and, during the summer, recorded the album &quot;Northern Star&quot;. She recorded &quot;Ga Ga&quot; from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. The song was released as promotional single on 25 June, only in the UK. She also co-wrote and recorded the backing vocals for &quot;(Hey You) Free Up Your Mind&quot;, sung by Emma Bunton from the film soundtrack &quot;Pokémon: The First Movie&quot;. On 27 September, Chisholm released her debut single, &quot;Goin&#x27; Down&quot; and peaked at number 4 in the UK and 25 in Australia. The music video was shot in Los Angeles and directed by Giuseppi Capotondi. Her debut album, &quot;Northern Star&quot;, was released on 18 October 1999, peaked at number 4 and sold 4 million copies worldwide, received triple platinum in the UK, and another seven certifications, including platinum in Germany and Sweden. &quot;Northern Star&quot; was released as a second single and also peaked at number 4. To promote the album, Chisholm embarked on a tour called From Liverpool to Leicester Square, travelling to Australia, the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Netherlands and Denmark, between 27 September and 1 November. In 2000, Chisholm had two songs in film soundtracks, &quot;Suddenly Monday&quot; in &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; and &quot;Go!&quot; in &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;.

Her next single, &quot;Never Be the Same Again&quot;, was a contemporary R&amp;B song. The song, which features TLC member Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes, was released on 20 March 2000 and became Chisholm&#x27;s first number 1 single. It received gold certification in the UK and also peaked at number 1 in Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Scotland and Sweden. The song was the 18th best-selling song of 2000 and sold more than a million copies across Europe. After the success of &quot;Never Be the Same Again&quot;, the label decided to release two more singles. On 7 August 2000, Virgin released a remix version of &quot;I Turn to You&quot; as the fourth single; the song became her second number 1 in the UK, Netherlands and Sweden. &quot;I Turn to You&quot; also peaked at number 1 in Austria, Denmark and Dance Club Songs of United States. &quot;If That Were Me&quot; was released as the fifth and final single and peaked at number 18. The proceeds from its sale went to the Kandu Arts charity. The North American version of &quot;Northern Star&quot; was released on 21 August 2000 and included the single versions of &quot;Never Be The Same Again&quot; and &quot;I Turn To You&quot;. In late 2000, after the first solo work of members, the Spice Girls released their third and final album, &quot;Forever&quot;, sporting a new edgier R&amp;B sound. &quot;Holler&quot; and &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot; were released as singles on 23 October 2000 and the songs reached number 1 in the UK. The album sold 5 million copies. The group announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus. In the same year, the Chinese singer FanFan recorded a Chinese version of &quot;Suddenly Monday&quot; from her debut album &quot;FanFan&#x27;s World&quot;.

Chisholm embarked in her first world tour, the Northern Star Tour, between late 2000 and 26 August 2001, to promote her debut album. The tour travelled in 76 dates, 30 countries and 4 continents, just not going to Oceania and South America. The Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire concert was webcast on Chisholm&#x27;s original website with a special appearance of Bryan Adams. On 4 April 2001, The audio of the Anaheim concert also was webcast on House of Blues&#x27; website. A remixed album, entitled &quot;Remix Collection&quot;, was released only in Japan. In 2001, Chisholm collaborated in the live album of Russell Watson, &quot;The Voice – Live&quot;, as featured vocals in the songs &quot;Barcelona&quot; and &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Kind of Glad We Did?&quot;.
Chisholm began recording her second album in November 2001. She travelled to the United States to record some songs. During this time, she also recorded &quot;Independence Day&quot; from the film soundtrack &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot; and wrote &quot;Help Me Help You&quot; for Holly Valance, included in her album &quot;Footprints&quot;. Chisholm, along with Anastacia made an appearance at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards to present the award for &quot;Best Song&quot;, which was given to P!nk.

Chisholm&#x27;s second album was postponed to 10 March 2003. Chisholm also took time out due to struggles with clinical depression. On 24 February 2003 the first single from her new album was released, &quot;Here It Comes Again&quot;, which reached number 7 in the UK and peaked in the top 20 in Spain and Ireland. She released her second studio album, &quot;Reason&quot;, on 10 March 2003 and it peaked at number 5, received gold certification in the UK. The label sent Chisholm to promote the album, including several pocket shows. On 24 April 2003, she embarked in the Reason Tour, travelling only in Europe. The second single, &quot;On the Horizon&quot;, was released on 2 June 2003. After the previous single, music critics were predicting that this single would redeem Chisholm&#x27;s chart success, but the song peaked at number 14 and did not help sales.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Love&quot;, was released as a single exclusively in Japan and used for a Toyota Motor Corporation commercial. Alongside promoting the album, Chisholm competed on the reality sports game show &quot;The Games&quot;. On 11 September 2003, during a taping of &quot;The Games&quot;, Chisholm competed in a judo match with Turkish-Dutch actress Azra Akin, which resulted in Chisholm injuring her knee. Because of this, the song &quot;Yeh Yeh Yeh&quot;, which was planned to be released as the third and final single on 22 September 2003, had to be pushed back because she could not fully promote an upbeat song with an injury. &quot;Melt&quot; was then chosen to be launched along with &quot;Yeh Yeh Yeh&quot; as a double A-side, because she could do a small number of performances. The double single was released on 10 November 2003. The song peaked at number 27. In other countries of Europe, &quot;Melt&quot; wasn&#x27;t released, only &quot;Yeh Yeh Yeh&quot; as a solo release. After the release of &quot;Melt/Yeh Yeh Yeh&quot;, Chisholm added some extra dates to the Reason Tour, and the Avo Session Basel concert was broadcast on 3sat.

===2004–2006: Red Girl Records and &quot;Beautiful Intentions&quot;===

On 1 January 2004, Virgin Records dismissed Chisholm after the conflict in previous years about the direction in her solo career. In April 2004, she founded her own label, Red Girl Records, to record and release her own projects. All of Chisholm&#x27;s activities are decided upon and funded by herself. The label name was inspired by the colours of the football Liverpool F.C., of which Chisholm is a supporter. Nancy Phillips, who had been Chisholm&#x27;s manager and business partner since the label&#x27;s inception, retired in 2017.

In June 2004, she embarked in a five-date concert tour, The Barfly Mini-Tour, performed in The Barfly music halls, a series of venues dedicated to independent music. In October 2004, Chisholm finished recording her third album. In an interview, Chisholm said she wanted to create deeper songs using piano, violin and personal themes. On 4 April 2005, Chisholm released &quot;Next Best Superstar&quot; as the lead single of her third album. It was released in three formats: two singles with B-sides – the acoustic version or the B-side &quot;Everything Must Change&quot; – and a remixes EP. The song peaked at number 10 in the UK. On 11 April, she released &quot;Beautiful Intentions&quot;, her third album and first by Red Girl. It was produced by Greg Haver, Guy Chambers, Paul Boddy and eleven of the twelve songs were written by Chisholm. The album peaked at number 24 in the UK, top 15 other Europeans countries, and was certified gold in Germany and Switzerland.

In support of the album, she embarked at Beautiful Intentions Tour, starting on 16 April in O2 Academy Birmingham, in London, and travelling for twenty-five dates across Europe and Asia. On 1 August, &quot;Better Alone&quot; was released only in the UK as the second single, but did not enter the charts due to the single being available online. &quot;First Day of My Life&quot; was released as single on 30 September in Australia and Europe – except in the UK. The song was not included in the original version of the album, only in the 2006 re-released version, becoming the second international single from &quot;Beautiful Intentions&quot;. Originally been recorded by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, with lyrics in Italian as &quot;Un Nuovo Giorno&quot; for his 2004 eponymous album &quot;Andrea&quot;. The song peaked at number 1 in Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Portugal, number 2 in Austria, and in the top 30 in Norway, France and Denmark.

==Personal life==
Chisholm has been open about her experiences with clinical depression and an eating disorder. She spoke of her eating disorder to &quot;Contact Music&quot;, stating, &quot;I&#x27;d hammered the gym for three hours a day. It was a way of running away, not thinking. I felt like a robot. When the papers started calling me &#x27;Sumo Spice&#x27;, I was only a size 10. But I was so upset by all the criticism, it got worse and I went up to a size 14.&quot; In a 2022 interview with &quot;The Cut&quot;, Chisholm elaborated, &quot;It took me such a long time to recover. I would never want to be arrogant enough to say I&#x27;m all better because I&#x27;m always aware that they could come back. I&#x27;ve really learned how to look after myself. Sometimes, a healthy work-life balance is impossible to maintain. There are times, if I&#x27;m very tired or work&#x27;s very stressful, I can feel things slipping. We all talk about self-care, but it is so vital for me to keep me on track with everything&quot;.

It made me not only realise I had a huge responsibility to her but I have a huge responsibility to myself. In being her teacher, I had to treat myself better.&quot; From 2015 to 2022, Chisholm dated her manager, Joe Marshall.

Chisholm is a supporter of Liverpool F.C. and an amateur triathlete, having completed the London Triathlon twice.

While promoting her &quot;Who I Am&quot; autobiography in September 2022, Chisholm revealed that she had been sexually assaulted in October 1997, during a massage in a hotel in Turkey, on the eve of the first Girl Power! Live in Istanbul show. On Elizabeth Day&#x27;s podcast, &quot;How to Fail&quot;, Chisholm said: &quot;I treat[ed] myself to a massage in the hotel and what happened to me, I kind of buried immediately because there were other things to focus on[...] I didn&#x27;t want to make a fuss but also I didn&#x27;t have time to deal with it. I felt violated, I felt very vulnerable, I felt embarrassed[...] I do want to talk about it because it has affected me. But I buried it.&quot;

On 29 August 2024, Chisholm was the subject of the BBC One genealogy series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?.&quot;

==Cultural impact and legacy==

As a Spice Girls member Chisholm was called &quot;Sporty Spice&quot; because she usually wore a tracksuit paired with athletic shoes, wore her long dark hair in a high ponytail, and sported a tough girl attitude as well as tattoos on both of her arms. She has a tattoo on her left arm of a black Christian cross. On her upper-right arm she has tattoos of two Chinese characters: &quot;女&quot; meaning &quot;female&quot; and &quot;力&quot; meaning &quot;force&quot; which together represent the phrase &quot;girl power&quot;. She also possessed true athletic abilities, including being able to perform back handsprings. The term &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; became prominent in the media and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by New Labour and the new UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.
Although by no means responsible for the onset of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;, the arrival of the Spice Girls added to the new image and re-branding of Britain, and underlined the growing world popularity of British, rather than American, pop music.

The Spice Girls broke onto the music scene at a time when alternative rock, hip-hop and R&amp;B dominated global music charts. The modern pop phenomenon that the Spice Girls created by targeting early Millennials was credited with changing the global music landscape, bringing about the global wave of late-1990s and early-2000s teen pop acts such as Hanson, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and NSYNC. The Spice Girls have also been credited with paving the way for the girl groups and female pop singers that have come after them. In the UK, they are credited for their massive commercial breakthrough in the previously male-dominated pop music scene, leading to the widespread formation of new girl groups in the late 1990s and early 2000s including All Saints, B*Witched, Atomic Kitten, Girls Aloud and Sugababes, hoping to emulate the Spice Girls&#x27; success. The Pussycat Dolls, 2NE1, Girls&#x27; Generation, Little Mix, Fifth Harmony, Lady Gaga, Jess Glynne, Alexandra Burke, Kim Petras, Charli XCX, Rita Ora, Demi Lovato, Carly Rae Jepsen, Regine Velasquez, MØ, Billie Eilish and Adele credit the Spice Girls as a major influence.

Some songs from &quot;Northern Star&quot; have appeared in films, such as &quot;Ga Ga&quot; which is heard in &quot;Charmed&quot; and &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. The song &quot;Go&quot; makes an appearance in &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;. &quot;Suddenly Monday&quot; appears in &quot;Maybe Baby&quot; and on its soundtrack. After the song gained popularity, &quot;I Turn to You&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;. It was covered by Darkseed on &quot;Ultimate Darkness&quot;, by Machinae Supremacy on &quot;Webography&quot;, and by Wig Wam on &quot;667.. The Neighbour of the Beast&quot;. The song was also featured in the musical &quot;Viva Forever!&quot;, a musical show based on the songs of the Spice Girls. Some songs have also been covered by international artists such as Christine Fan, who covered and translated &quot;Suddenly Monday&quot; in Chinese for her debut album &quot;FanFan&#x27;s World&quot;, and Dutch pop singer Do who covered the Japanese bonus-track &quot;Follow Me&quot;, for her album of the same name. The single &quot;First Day of My Life&quot; was originally recorded by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, with lyrics in Italian as &quot;Un Nuovo Giorno&quot; (&quot;A new day&quot;) for his 2004 album &quot;Andrea&quot;, and he also released it as a single the same year. Chisolm&#x27;s version of the single was a success in German-speaking countries because it was used as the title song of the German soap opera telenovela &quot;Wege zum Glück&quot;. At the time of &quot;The Sea&quot;″s release, the lead single &quot;Rock Me&quot; served as the official theme song for German TV channel ZDF&#x27;s coverage of the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

<text>The Presidents&#x27; Athletic Conference (PAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. Of its 11 member schools, all private, liberal arts institutions of higher learning, nine are located in Western Pennsylvania. The other two are located in adjacent areas, historically tied to Western Pennsylvania—Appalachian Ohio and the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia.

==History==
The PAC was founded in 1955 by the presidents of Western Reserve University (1955–1967, operating athletically as Adelbert College from 1967 to 1970), Case Institute of Technology (1955–1970), John Carroll University (1955–1989) and Wayne State University (1955–1967). Unlike other conferences of the time, the PAC was designed to be supervised by the presidents of the institutions rather than the athletic directors. Member institutions were to admit athletes on the same academic standards as other students and award scholarships based only on academic achievement or need.

By 1958, the PAC expanded east to include Allegheny College (1958–1984, 2022–), Bethany College (1958–), Thiel College (1958–) and Washington &amp; Jefferson College (1958–). Eventually, many other member institutions joined the PAC, like Chatham University (2007–), Geneva College (2007–), Grove City College (1984–), Saint Vincent College (2006–), Thomas More College (2005–2018), Waynesburg University (1990–) and Westminster College (2000–).

Some former PAC member institutions are Alfred University (1996–1998), Carnegie Mellon University (1968–1990), Eastern Michigan University (1962–1967) and Hiram College (1971–1989, returning in 2025). On May 31, 2017, Thomas More College (University), announced its withdrawal from the PAC at the conclusion of the 2017–18 school year.

In April 2019, Franciscan University, which had joined the PAC as an associate member in the newly launched conference sports of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse for the 2018–19 school year, was unveiled as the effective replacement for Thomas More. Franciscan added five sports to its PAC membership for 2019–20—women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, and became a full conference member in 2020–21.

Effective July 1, 2022, Allegheny College rejoined the PAC after a 38-year absence spent in the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). Allegheny remains an affiliate member of the NCAC in the sport of field hockey as the PAC does not sponsor the sport.

On April 23, 2024, the PAC announced that Hiram would return to full PAC membership after an absence of 35 years. It joined for administrative purposes on July 1 of that year, coinciding with its becoming a men&#x27;s volleyball associate member, but will not start conference competition in other sports until 2025–26.

The headquarters is located in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="262477" wikidata="Q333335" url="?curid=262477" title="Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens">
<text>Timothy S. &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens (born September 13, 1967) is an American heavy metal singer who currently performs with KK&#x27;s Priest, Spirits of Fire, the Three Tremors and &quot;The Tim Ripper Monster Energy Big Band&quot;. He first gained attention as the lead singer of Judas Priest and then Iced Earth. He took the nickname &quot;Ripper&quot; from the Judas Priest song &quot;The Ripper&quot; during his time in the tribute band British Steel. 

In 2020, Owens was announced as the frontman for the band KK&#x27;s Priest, which also features former Judas Priest member KK Downing.

==Early life==
Owens was born in Akron, Ohio, on September 13, 1967. He graduated from Kenmore High School in 1985.

==Career==

===Brainicide and Winter&#x27;s Bane/British Steel===
Owens began his musical career as the singer for Brainicide, a thrash metal band based in his home town of Akron, Ohio that had also been known as Dammage, Inc. He recorded 3 demo tapes with them before the band split in 1989. Prior to joining Judas Priest in 1996, Owens fronted a band called Winter&#x27;s Bane, with whom he recorded an album called &quot;Heart of a Killer&quot; in 1993. He was most prominent in his role as the frontman of Judas Priest tribute band British Steel, named after the Judas Priest album, although the bands Winter&#x27;s Bane and British Steel were actually one and the same. The band would often open their shows as Winter&#x27;s Bane in order to introduce the audience to their original material. After finishing their original set, they would then take a break, which included a wardrobe change to emulate the subject of their tribute, Judas Priest. Winter&#x27;s Bane sound engineer Ken Reffner would come out from behind the soundboard, adding a fifth member to the stage. Reffner can be seen playing the part of K. K. Downing with British Steel in the Judas Priest episode of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;.

===Judas Priest===

Owens made headlines in 1996 when he went from being a fan of the English heavy metal band Judas Priest to being their lead singer, replacing Rob Halford. Despite numerous rumors that Halford would reunite with Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, as well as two live albums and a 2002 DVD release. Owens also helped write one Judas Priest song, &quot;What&#x27;s My Name?&quot;, which was a bonus track on &quot;Demolition&quot;. With Judas Priest, he was nominated once for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1999, with the song &quot;Bullet Train&quot; from the album &quot;Jugulator&quot;, but lost to Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Better than You&quot;.

====&quot;Rock Star&quot;====
The movie &quot;Rock Star&quot; (2001), about a tribute band singer who is asked to join the band he has tried to imitate, was loosely based on Owens&#x27; career. Judas Priest disavowed the movie after they were denied creative control in the screenplay and script. For example, in &quot;Rock Star&quot; the band throws out their original singer while on tour and replaces him a few days later; while in real life, Rob Halford was not thrown out, but left Judas Priest, four years before he was replaced. Owens said of the movie, &quot;They fabricated things and decided to pull away from my story and make their own because I guess mine was too normal. There&#x27;s no telling what they put in there. If I could sue, I would.&quot;

===Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s Rising Force===
Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. Owens seized opportunity when, that same year, vocalist Matt Barlow quit Iced Earth. Iced Earth&#x27;s first album with Owens, &quot;The Glorious Burden&quot;, came out in early 2004. While singing with Judas Priest, Owens had toured with Iced Earth (and Anthrax) in 2001, but the tour was cut short. In 2006, Owens also reunited with his former Winter&#x27;s Bane colleague Dennis Hayes in a band called Beyond Fear. The self-titled debut album from his new band was released in May of that year. Hayes would join Iced Earth as well in 2007 after bassist James &quot;Bo&quot; Wallace left due to family health issues.

Owens&#x27; stay in Iced Earth was short, however, as on December 11, 2007, guitarist Jon Schaffer announced that Owens would be leaving the band; Matt Barlow had been invited to return to the line-up after heavy feedback from fans.

On February 26, 2008, it was announced that Owens would be the new lead singer for Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s Rising Force, replacing Doogie White. Owens quit Malmsteen&#x27;s band in 2012, saying there were conflicts in show dates between his solo band and Yngwie&#x27;s touring, but that he would be open to the possibility of working with him again.

In May 2009, Owens released his first solo album, &quot;Play My Game&quot;. The album featured many prominent metal musicians. A European tour followed in 2010, accompanied by musicians Anders Buaas (guitar), Jon Vegard Naess (guitar), Are Gogstad (bass), and Henrik &quot;Rick&quot; Hagan (drums).

===Charred Walls of the Damned, HAIL! and Dio Disciples===

Owens now fronts a new project called Charred Walls of the Damned, a band founded in 2009 by Richard Christy, radio personality on The Howard Stern Show and former drummer for Iced Earth and Death. The origin of the band&#x27;s name was explained on May 20, 2009. It derives from a series of radio prank calls Christy made to a Christian radio station. In response to the pranks they received, the host described how he prays for them, thus &quot;saving their soul to be saved by God&#x27;s grace...not in the devil&#x27;s hell where you&#x27;d be putting your nails in the charred walls of the damned&quot;. The band features Christy on drums and Owens on vocals, along with Steve Di Giorgio (bass guitar) and Jason Suecof (lead guitar). The band&#x27;s debut self-titled album was released on February 2, 2010 through Metal Blade Records. 

Owens is also a member of a cover band called HAIL!. HAIL!&#x27;s rotating cast of members include Owens, Andreas Kisser, Paul Bostaph, David Ellefson, Mike Portnoy, Jimmy DeGrasso, and Roy Mayorga. Owens, DeGrasso, Ellefson, and Kisser formed the band in late 2008. They toured Europe in 2009, June 2010, and came together to perform at a benefit for Deftones bassist Chi Cheng in 2010. The lineup consisted of Owens, Portnoy, Mark Anthony of the Letter Black, Phil Demmel of Machine Head, and Ellefson. HAIL! is on their second European tour with the lineup Andreas Kisser, Owens, Paul Bostaph, and James LoMenzo. Due to the death of previously announced bassist Paul Gray, LoMenzo agreed on one day&#x27;s notice to fly to Portugal for the Rock in Rio festival where HAIL! was scheduled to perform on May 30, 2010. 

In early 2011, Owens also joined Dio Disciples, which features former Dio members.

Other music projects of Owens include Project Rock with Keri Kelli, Rudy Sarzo, James Kottak, and Teddy Zig Zag.

Owens owned &quot;Ripper&#x27;s Rock House&quot;, a sports eatery, restaurant and entertainment venue, in Akron, Ohio. In August 2015, &quot;Bar Rescue&quot; filmed and transformed the bar into &quot;Tim Owens&#x27; Traveler&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. The venue closed permanently in September 2016.

He was also the owner of &quot;Ripper Owens Tap House&quot;, the predecessor to &quot;Ripper&#x27;s Rock House&quot;, in Akron&#x27;s Firestone Park neighborhood.

In 2015, Owens recorded music for the fictional band Witches&#x27; Lips for the heavy metal horror film &quot;Hairmetal Shotgun Zombie Massacre: The Movie&quot;. He recorded and wrote the lyrics with guitarist Marzi Montazeri of Philip H. Anselmo and The Illegals.

Ted Kirkpatrick, drummer and songwriter for the Christian metal band Tourniquet, announced on July 25, 2018, that Owens would be doing lead vocals for all the songs (except the title track &quot;Gazing at Medusa&quot;) on their next album. The album, &quot;Gazing at Medusa&quot;, was released on October 16, 2018.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, Owens was part of a Grunge themed tribute band called Seattle, playing covers of Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and other Grunge bands of the era.

In December 2022, Owens released a solo album under the name &#x27;Ripper&#x27;, titled &quot;Return to Death Row&quot;.

In 2024, Owens once again sang on Leviathan Project&#x27;s album, &quot;MCMLXXXII&quot;, which also featured Vinny Appice on drums, Bobby Koelble (Death) on lead guitar and Tommy Kay (Britny Fox) on guitar.

<text>Meadows Field is a public airport in Kern County, California, United States, three miles northwest of downtown Bakersfield. It is the main airport for the Bakersfield area, and one of two international airports in the San Joaquin Valley, the other Fresno Yosemite International Airport. Also known as Kern County Airport #1, it is located in an area of unincorporated Kern County adjacent to Oildale, California.

Federal Aviation Administration records show 141,847 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 103,067 in 2009 and 111,699 in 2010. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

== History ==
Aviation has been linked to Kern County for almost as long as the existence of the industry. In 1891, Charles Howard ascended in a hot air balloon to . He jumped and landed safely with a parachute he designed and constructed. By 1910, only seven years after the Wright Brothers&#x27; first airplane flight, aircraft began arriving in the county. They were brought in by Glenn Curtiss (in conjunction with the Kern County Board of Trade). The first flight in the area was flown by Charles Hamilton.

Bakersfield then had two airfields. The more prominent field was at Sacramento and Monterey streets in East Bakersfield (at the time, mostly empty fields). It was named Bernard Field and was run by the Pacific Aero Club. The field would be a stop for US Air Mail from 1923 to 1926 (when that moved to Meadows Field). Another airfield was on the Panorama Bluffs in Northeast Bakersfield where Greenlawn Mortuary is today.

With the development of commercial air service, Bakersfield needed a purpose-built commercial airport. In 1926, the Kern County Chamber of Commerce constructed and operated a new airport called Kern County Airport No. 1. Originally at the intersection of U.S. Route 99 and Norris Road, the following year it was moved one mile east to its current location. The original facility had one runway, one terminal building, and a few hangars and other buildings. In 1935, Kern County bought the airport from the Chamber of Commerce. It was the first county-owned airport in the nation.

=== United States Army Air Force use ===
In September 1939, war broke out in Europe, prompting Congress to appropriate $40 million for the Development of Landing Areas for National Defense (DLAND). Under DLAND, the secretaries of War, Commerce, and the Navy approved expenditures for airports. By 1941, the Army Air Corps had begun directing aid to Meadows Field for improvements to include the operation of airport towers.

In late 1943, the United States Army Air Forces acquired usage rights to Meadows Field. It was placed under the jurisdiction of the IV Fighter Command. The 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group (NFOTG) used the facility as part of the Army Air Forces Night Fighter School, which had transferred from Florida to Hammer Field, California. Meadows Field was used as an auxiliary training airfield and the school operated a combination of modified Douglas A-20 Havocs for night fighter operations, designated P-70, and brand-new prototype YP-61 Black Widow night fighters.

Between May 1 and July 12, 1944, the 427th Night Fighter Squadron trained at Meadows Field; the 549th Night Fighter Squadron trained there between July and October 1944. In addition, flights of P-61s from the 426th, 547th, 548th, and 550th Night Fighter squadrons moved in and out of Meadows Field during 1944 as part of their training prior to being deployed to combat units, primarily in the Pacific and CBI theaters.

In December 1944, the 481st NFOTG was inactivated as part of an AAF reorganization. Meadows Field was placed on standby status and the airport was only used for emergency purposes, being under the control of Hammer Field.

A Republic XF-84H Thunderscreech, an experimental fighter powered by a turboprop engine, was on display at the entrance to the former air terminal at Skyway Drive and Hanger Way until 1992 when it was reclaimed and moved to the National Museum of the United States Air Force. It was subsequently replaced by a U.S. Air Force T-38 Talon supersonic jet trainer. The T-38 was donated and was moved to the Minter Field Air Museum at Shafter Airport in 2015.

=== Return to civil control and expansion ===
After the war, Meadows Field would return to being a commercial airport. In the mid-1950s, Kern County would modernize the airport. The land was purchased and new facilities were built; in 1957, a new terminal and control tower was built east of the runway. That year, the county renamed the airport Meadows Field (by a board of minute order on August 6, 1957), after Cecil Meadows. He was the county&#x27;s Director of Airports from 1935 to 1957, except during World War II when he was a pilot in the armed forces. He was also responsible for the county purchasing the airport and modernization efforts.

=== Historical airline service ===
Commercial airline service to Bakersfield dates back to 1927 when Pacific Air Transport operated a route from Los Angeles to Seattle stopping at Bakersfield, Fresno, San Francisco, Medford, and Portland. By 1934, Pacific Air Transport merged with three other carriers to become United Airlines. United flew Boeing 727s and Boeing 737-200s to Los Angeles and to San Francisco from the late 1960s until 1979 and again from 1984 to 1987. For a short time in 1933 and 1934, Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA) served the city on a San Francisco-Fresno-Bakersfield-Los Angeles route. Other carriers include Southwest Airways and successors Pacific Air Lines, Air West, and Hughes Airwest that served the airport from 1956 until 1979 with Fairchild F-27 and DC-9-10s. In 1966, Pacific Air Lines operated Boeing 727-100s nonstop to Los Angeles and Fresno and one-stop to San Francisco; this was the airport&#x27;s first jet service. Pacific Express served the airport with BAC One-Elevens nonstop to San Francisco and Santa Barbara during the 1980s. Continental Airlines flew Douglas DC-9s on a Las Vegas-Houston route in 1982 and flew Boeing 737-200s to Denver from 1987–1988. America West Airlines operated mainline service to Las Vegas from 1990–1991 using the De Havilland Dash 8 turboprop. From 1984 until 1999, American Airlines operated Dallas/Fort Worth service using the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 which initially included a Santa Barbara stopover. From September 1994 through April 1995, American operated a Boeing 757-200 to John Wayne Airport and one-stop to Chicago-O&#x27;Hare which is believed to be the largest commercial jetliner to serve Bakersfield. Allegiant Air operated to Las Vegas from 2010–2011 using the McDonnell Douglas MD-80, and Frontier Airlines briefly flew Airbus A319s to Denver in 2014.

From 2007 until 2008, Mexicana flew Airbus A318s non-stop to Guadalajara.

A number of commuter and regional carriers have served the airport including Air Pacific, Air L.A., American Eagle Airlines, Apollo Airways, Aspen Airways, Cal-State Air Lines, ExpressJet Airlines (initially operating as Continental Express and later independently), Imperial Airlines, Golden Gate Airlines, Golden West Airlines, Laughlin Express, Mesa Airlines (initially operating independently and later as America West Express and successor US Airways Express), Pacific Coast Airlines, SkyWest (initially operating independently and later as Western Express, Delta Connection and US Airways Express), Sun Aire, StatesWest Airlines (operating as USAir Express), Swift Aire Lines, WestAir (operating as United Express), and Wings West Airlines.

=== Deregulation and decline ===
The airport saw increased air service during the 1950s and 1960s; in 1975, annual enplanements would reach 97,000. The growth ended with airline deregulation in 1978. While other cities saw a decrease of prices and increase in service, almost all air service was eliminated from Meadows Field in favor of other airports such as LAX (about south). The City of Bakersfield and the County of Kern attempted to prevent a reduction in service by filing a joint lawsuit; however, the court sided with the federal government. Annual enplanements fell 59%, from 147,866 in 1978 to 60,958 in 1981 (although the next year it would rebound to 90,000). Air service would eventually average 120,000 enplanements between 1980 and 2000.

Service was expensive compared to nearby airports and normally ran during inconvenient times. Service was also inconsistent, with airlines frequently starting and ending routes. During the same time period, the region also saw a large growth in population. While the City of Bakersfield grew 134%, and the County of Kern grew 64%, the airport did not see an increase in service to match. Except for the lengthening of the main runway in 1987 to accommodate wide-body jets, few improvements were done at Meadows Field during that period.

=== Rebirth and rise to international airport ===

In the early 2000s, the county started an initiative to address the problems in air service. In 2002, it was estimated that about 400,000 people who lived in the service area of the airport chose to fly from a different location; 25% of those flew to destinations in Mexico. Kern County started multiple projects to address the reluctance of airlines to use the airport. They included: installing centerline landing lights on the main runway, extending the second runway to 7,700 feet (the length most airplanes that use the airport would need), construction of a new terminal with jet bridges and inside baggage claim, and remodeling the existing terminal to accommodate international flights. Most improvements were completed by 2006, with the international terminal completed in 2007.

Initial response was favorable. Four new airlines would start service at the airport, including international service to Mexico operated by Mexicana. This would also increase enplanements above the levels set in 1978. However, high gas prices and the subsequent recession of 2008 would reduce service to 2002 levels, including the loss of the airport&#x27;s international carrier. However, the US Customs house would remain open. In addition to serving international charter and unscheduled flights, it would process international cargo. Both the Tejon Industrial Complex (south of Bakersfield) and the International Trade and Transportation Center (in Shafter, west of Bakersfield) would lease warehouse space at the airport for use by their clients.
== Facilities ==
Meadows Field covers 1,357 acres (549 ha) at an elevation of 510 feet (155 m). It has two asphalt runways: 12L/30R is 10,855 by 150 feet (3,309 x 46 m) and 12R/30L is 7,703 by 100 feet (2,348 x 30 m).

The main runway, 12L-30R, is the longest in the San Joaquin Valley. It is classified as a commercial D-IV runway, but can handle Boeing 747s. The other runway, 12R-30L, is a general aviation B-II runway. Although only 75 feet of width is required for this classification, the runway is 25 feet wider to allow it to serve as an alternate runway for turboprop and regional jets.

In the year ending May 31, 2018, the airport had 61,229 aircraft operations, average 168 per day: 76% general aviation, 20% air taxi, 4% airline, and &lt;1% military. In November 2021, 194 aircraft were based at the airport: 108 single-engine, 52 multi-engine, 32 jet, 1 ultralight, and 1 helicopter.

== Terminals ==

=== William M. Thomas Terminal ===
William M. Thomas Terminal has six gates numbered 2 through 6. Gate 1 is inoperational due to the lack of a jet bridge, and Gate 6 is at ground level. The terminal also contains an Omni Goods gift shop and a Blimpie sandwich restaurant. Features of the terminal include a rotunda with compass point floor design and a scaled model of Spaceship One (which flew out of Mojave about east of Bakersfield). It is also constructed on a hill, which allows for all passenger services to be on the second level, while airport services are on the first. The terminal was constructed in 2006 at a cost of $33.8 million and designed by Odell Associates.

=== International Air Terminal ===

Kern County Air Terminal was built in 1957 and had three gates: 4, 5, 5A. It handled all commercial flights until the William M. Thomas Terminal opened in 2006.

In 2006, the terminal underwent a $1 million renovation and an adjacent $7 million US Customs &amp; Immigration facility was built. The terminal was reopened in 2007 and renamed &quot;International Air Terminal at Meadows Field&quot; to handle both international departures and arrivals.

The terminal closed again in 2008 when its only air carrier, Mexicana, suspended service. As of December 2020, the terminal remains mothballed and all of its signage has been covered up or removed.

The terminal had an adjacent motel known as Skyway Inn, and a restaurant which in its existence was known as Freddie&#x27;s at the Skyway House, Anton&#x27;s Airport Bar &amp; Grille, Milano&#x27;s, and Skyway Steakhouse. Both the motel and the restaurant were closed in 2001 due to the decline in passenger traffic following the September 11 attacks and were later demolished in 2005.

== Terminal connections ==
Although the International Terminal is currently closed (the US Customhouse remains open), when the terminal was open there was no airport transportation between it and the Domestic Terminal. There is also no road connection or pedestrian access between the two terminals. For passengers to transfer (from the international terminal to the domestic terminal), they would leave the airport and turn left on Airport Drive. They would then turn left on Merle Haggard Drive. Passengers would then re-enter the airport at Wings Way, a distance of approximately . There is a long-term plan to extend Wings Way through the airport, which would provide a more direct connection, but there is no date for construction.

== Ground transportation ==

=== Road ===
The airport is located at the intersection of Merle Haggard Drive and Airport Drive, in Oildale (also called North Bakersfield). Access to the Domestic Terminal is from Merle Haggard Drive while access to the International Terminal is from Airport Drive. The primary signed route to the airport is via SR 99 (Golden State Freeway). Drivers traveling north exit at Porterville Highway (SR 65) while drivers traveling south exit at 7th Standard Road/Merle Haggard Drive. In both cases, drivers then turn east on Merle Haggard Drive, which leads to the airport. There is an alternate signed route via Golden State Highway (SR 204 Freeway). Drivers exit at Airport Drive, and travel north to the airport.

The Domestic Terminal provides fee parking for both short-term, and long-term parking. People can also park for free in the short term parking for a limited amount of time. The International Terminal provides free parking for both short term, and long term parking.

=== Public transportation ===
Public transportation to the airport was provided exclusively by Golden Empire Transit. Routes 22 and 45 stop close to the airport, but not inside. There are no scheduled bus routes to the Domestic Terminal.

=== Rental car/taxi ===
Rental cars are only available at the Domestic Terminal. Currently four companies are located at the airport. Rental car counter space is on the east side of the terminal, with the car lots directly outside the east exit.

Taxi stands are located outside the north entrance to the terminal, across the street. Taxis are sometimes available when flights are arriving at the airport. Meadows Field also lists two taxi companies on their website, which provide 24-hour pickup, if no taxis are available.

There are extremely limited rideshare options, as the airport is only serviced by Lyft.

== Future ==
Kern County has planned several improvements to the airport over the next 20 years, all of which are based on future demand.

=== Passenger ===
The domestic terminal was constructed in anticipation of future expansion. Currently, it has four jet bridges to connect passengers to aircraft. Without any new construction, an additional jet bridge can be added. The existing gate area can then be extended towards the runway for an additional seven gates. After that, a new concourse can be constructed on the west side of the terminal for 12 more gates. That puts the ultimate capacity for the terminal at 24 gates.

Other facilities are planned to expand with these future changes to the terminal. The existing parking lot will grow both east and west. The rental car parking lots will be consolidated and relocated east of the terminal. Wings Way, the road that connects to the airport, will be extend to Airport Drive and connect to Day Avenue.

=== Cargo ===
Currently, all cargo operations are conducted out of a small facility, east of the international terminal. A new, expanded cargo facility is planned west of Merle Haggard Drive, north of the runway. Ultimate build out will contain 12 sortation buildings, each. A road will connect them to trucking/warehouse/distribution facilities west of the airport. That road will terminate at Porterville Highway (SR 65) and Merle Haggard Drive (at Wings Way). Other aviation-related structures are planned in the area.

In addition, there is a long-term plan to construct a third parallel runway. Designated 13–31, it will be located north of the cargo facilities, as well as Merle Haggard Drive. The runway is planned to be long and wide. It will be widely spaced, which will allow for simultaneous Instrument Flight Rule (IFR).

<text>International students or exchange students, also known as foreign students, are students who undertake all or part of their secondary or tertiary education in a country other than their own.

In 2021, there were over 6.39 million international students, up from 5.12 million in 2016. The most popular destinations were the United States (with 833,204 international students), the United Kingdom (600,589 students), and Australia (378,439 students) which together receive 28.37% of international students.

==National definitions==

Definitions of &quot;foreign student&quot; and &quot;international student&quot; vary from country to country.

In the US, international students are &quot;[i]ndividuals studying in the United States on a non-immigrant, temporary visa that allows for academic study at the post-secondary level.&quot; Most international students in the US hold an F1 Visa.

In Europe, students from countries who are a part of the European Union can take part in a student exchange program called the Erasmus Programme. The program allows for students from the EU to study in other countries under a government agreement.

Canada defines international students as &quot;non-Canadian students who do not have &#x27;permanent resident&#x27; status and have had to obtain the authorization of the Canadian government to enter Canada with the intention of pursuing an education.&quot; The study permit identifies the level of study and the length of time the individual may study in Canada. Unless it takes more than six months, international students do not need a study permit if they will finish the course within the period of stay authorized upon entry. Canada&#x27;s first International House (I-House), planned to help international students find housing and community, opened in 1959 at the University of British Columbia.

In Australia, an international student &quot;is not an Australian citizen, Australian permanent resident, New Zealand citizen, or a holder of an Australian permanent resident humanitarian visa.&quot;

According to the Institute of International Education, an international student in Japan is &quot;[a] student from a foreign economy who is receiving an education at any Japanese university, graduate school, junior college, college of technology, professional training college or university preparatory course and who resides in Japan with a &#x27;college student&#x27; visa status.&quot;

==Destinations of foreign students==
Student mobility in the first decade of the 21st century has been transformed by three major external events: the September 11 attacks, the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and an increasingly isolationist political order characterized by Brexit in the U.K. and the first presidency of Donald Trump in the U.S. Changes to the visa and immigration policies of destination countries impact the availability of employment during and after education. Political developments are often a major consideration; for example, a survey conducted before the 2020 presidential election in the U.S. indicated that a quarter of prospective international students were more likely to study in the country if Joseph R. Biden was elected president.

Traditionally the US and UK have been the most prestigious choices. There is increasing competition from several destinations in East Asia such as China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan which are keen to attract foreign students for reputation and demographic reasons.

According to OECD, almost one out of five foreign students is regionally mobile. This segment of regionally mobile students who seek global education at local cost is defined as &quot;glocal&quot; students]. Many &quot;glocal&quot; students consider pursuing transnational or cross-border education which allows them to earn a foreign credential while staying in their home countries. With the increase in tuition cost in leading destinations like the US and the UK along with the higher immigration barriers, many international students are exploring alternative destinations and demanding more &quot;value for money.&quot; Recalibrating value for money for international students It is projected that the number of internationally mobile students will reach 6.9 million by 2030, an increase of 51%, or 2.3 million students, from 2015. The affordability of international education is an area of concern not only for international students but also universities and nations interested in attracting them.

, the top 10 countries for foreign student enrollment according to Institute of International Education:
, the top 10 countries for foreign student enrollment according to UNESCO:
=== Asia ===
==== China ====

In 2016, China was the third largest receiver of international students globally, with 442,773 international students. By 2018 this number had grown to 492,185 (10.49% growth from 2017).
The number of international students in China has grown steadily since 2003, with apparently no impact from the rise of terrorism or the Great Recession. In contrast to the reported decline of enrollments in the USA and the UK, China&#x27;s international student market continues to strengthen. China is now the leading destination globally for Anglophone African students.

In 2016, the students coming to China were mostly from Asia (60%), followed by Europe (16%) and Africa (14%). However, Africa had the highest growth rate at 23.7% year-on-year 2015–2016.
The top 15 countries sending students to China in 2018 are listed below. African countries are grouped together and show a considerable block of students.

In 2016, international students mostly went to study in the major centers of Beijing (77,234, 17.44%) and Shanghai (59,887, 13.53%). In recent years there has been a decentralization and dispersion of students to other provinces.

Various factors combine to make China a desirable destination for international students.

# China boasts a significant number of world-class universities. 
# Universities in China are attractive research centers. 
# It costs relatively less than studying in developed countries.
# There is a huge diversity of universities and programs.
# There are more career opportunities due to China&#x27;s growing economic strength.
# Many graduate and postgraduate programs are offered in English.
# A huge number of scholarships (49,022 in 2016) are on offer from the Chinese government.

China is openly pursuing a policy of growing its soft power globally, by way of persuasion and attraction. Attracting international students, especially by way of scholarships, is one effective way of growing this influence.

====India====
In 2019, India was hosting over 47,000 overseas students and aims to quadruple the number 200,000 students by 2023. India has most its international students and targets from South, Southeast, West Asia and Africa and is running various fee waiver and scholarship programs.

==== Iran ====
Iran had 55000 studying in 2018 . In 2021 it doubled to more than 130000 with half of them enrolled in Azad University and Payamnoor. Iran Signed up PMF Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces to study at University of Tehran. By 2023 there were students from 15 countries such as Lebanon, Iraq, Russia, Syria, Pakistan, African countries. They study humanities sciences, law, medicine, construction, accounting.

==== Japan ====
Japan is perceived as an evolving destination for international students. Japan has around 180,000 overseas students studying at its institutions and the government has set targets to increase this to 300,000 over the next few years. According to the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO), the number of international students on 1 May 2022 was 231,146 people.

==== Malaysia and Singapore ====
Malaysia, Singapore and India are emerging destinations for international students. These three countries have combined share of approximately 12% of the global student market with somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 students having decided to pursue higher education studies in these countries in 2005–2006.

==== South Korea ====

In 2023, the number of international students studying at universities and colleges in South Korea was about 180,000.

=== Australia and Oceania ===
Australia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world, with 775,475 international students enrolled in the nation&#x27;s universities and vocational institutions in 2020. In 2019, international students represented 27% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education is one of the country&#x27;s largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country&#x27;s demographics as many students remain in Australia after graduation.

=== Europe ===
==== France and Germany ====
In 2016, France was the fourth largest receiver of international students globally, with 245,349 international students. Germany was the fifth largest receiver, with 244,575 international students. Since the 2016/17 academic year, the number of foreign students attending university in Germany has constantly risen, climbing from 358,895 students five years ago to 411,601 students last year.

With the Franco-German University, the two countries have established a framework for cooperation between their universities, enabling students to participate in specific Franco-German courses of study across borders.

The top 10 countries sending students to France in 2016 are listed below.

The top 10 countries sending students to Germany in 2015 are listed below.

==== United Kingdom ====
==== Netherlands ====
As of 2017, 81,000 international students studied in the Netherlands, compromising 12% of the higher education student population. Of these students, 12,500 students or 15.4% were Dutch nationals who had studied elsewhere previously. Three-fourths of international students in the Netherlands come from European Union countries, with the largest segment of that population coming from Germany. Of the non-EU students, the largest portion is composed of Chinese students. Two-thirds of all international students come to the Netherlands for their bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==== Russia ====
Russia, since the Soviet times, has been a hub for international students, mainly from the developing world. It is the world&#x27;s fifth-leading destination for international students, hosting roughly 300 thousand in 2019.

The top 10 countries sending students to Russia in 2019 are listed below.

=== North America ===
==== Canada ====

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) reckons that as of December 2019, there were 642,480 international students which is a 13% increase from the previous year. In 2019, 30% of the international students in Canada were from India and 25% were from China. The newest Canadian government International Education Strategy (IES) for the period 2019-2024 includes a commitment to diversify inbound students and distribute them more equally across the country rather than having a strong concentration in a few cities.

==== United States ====

Around 750,000 Chinese and 400,000 Indian students apply to overseas higher education institutions annually. New enrollment of undergraduate and graduate foreign students at American universities and colleges for 2016-17 declined by 2.1% or nearly 5,000 students which translates into a potential revenue of US$125 million for the first year of studies alone. Much of the increase in international students in the US during 2013–2014 was fueled by undergraduate students from China. The number of Chinese students increased to 31% of all foreign students in the US, the highest concentration of any one country since the Institute of International Education began collecting data on international students in 1948.

==Requirements==
Prospective foreign students are usually required to sit for language tests before they are admitted. Tests notwithstanding, while some international students already possess an excellent command of the local language upon arrival, some find their language ability, considered excellent domestically, inadequate for the purpose of understanding lectures, and/or of conveying oneself fluently in rapid conversations. A research report commissioned by NAFSA: Association of International Educators investigated the scope of third-party providers offerings intensive English preparation programs with academic credit for international students in the United States. These pathway programs are designed to recruit and support international students needing additional help with English and academic preparation before matriculating to a degree program.

===Student visa===
Generally, foreign students as citizens of other countries are required to obtain a student visa, which ascertains their legal status for staying in the second country. In the United States, before students come to the country, the students must select a school to attend to qualify for a student visa. The course of study and the type of school a foreign student plans to attend determine whether an F-1 visa or an M-1 visa is needed. Each student visa applicant must prove they have the financial ability to pay for their tuition, books and living expenses while they study in the states.

==Economic impact==
Research from the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers (NAFSA) shows the economic benefits of the increasing international higher-education enrollment in the United States. According to their 2021–2022 academic year analysis, nearly one million international students contributed $33.8 billion to the US economy and 335,000 jobs. This represents almost a 19% increase in dollars compared to the previous year.
International students contribute more than job and monetary gains to the economy. “The increase in economic activity is certainly positive news but it should be kept in perspective: it shows we’ve only regained about half the ground lost in the previous academic year,” said Dr. Esther D. Brimmer, NAFSA executive director and CEO. “We must not be complacent that this upward trend will automatically continue.
According to NAFSA&#x27;s research, their diverse views contribute to technological innovation has increased America&#x27;s ability to compete in the global economy.

On the other hand, international students have faced suspicions of involvement in economic and industrial espionage.

==Higher education marketing==
Marketing of higher education is a well-entrenched macro process today, especially in the major English-speaking nations: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. One of the major factors behind the worldwide evolution of educational marketing could be globalization, which has dramatically shrunken the world. Due to intensifying competition for overseas students amongst MESDCs, i.e. major English-speaking destination countries, higher educational institutions recognize the significance of marketing themselves, in the international arena. To build sustainable international student recruitment strategies Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to diversify the markets from which they recruit, both to take advantage of future growth potential from emerging markets, and to reduce dependency on – and exposure to risk from – major markets such as China, India and Nigeria, where demand has proven to be volatile. For recruitment strategies, there are some approaches that higher education institutions adopt to ensure stable enrollments of international students, such as developing university preparation programs, like the Global Assessment Certificate (GAC) Program, and launching international branch campuses in foreign countries.

===Global Assessment Certificate (GAC) Program===
The Global Assessment Certification (GAC) Program is a university preparation program, developed and provided by ACT Education Solution, Ltd., for the purpose of helping students to prepare for admission and enrollment overseas. The program helps students from non-English speaking backgrounds to prepare for university-level study, so they are able to successfully finish a bachelor&#x27;s degree at university. Students who complete the GAC program have the opportunity to be admitted to 120 so called Pathway Universities, located in destinations including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
Mainly, the program consists of curriculums, such as Academic English, Mathematics, Computing, Study Skills, Business, Science and Social Science. Moreover, the program also provides the opportunity to get prepared for the ACT exam and English Proficiency tests like TOEFL and IELTS.

===Foreign branch campuses===
Opening international branch campuses is a new strategy for recruiting foreign students in other countries in order to build strong global outreach by overcoming the limitations of physical distance. Indeed, opening branch campuses plays a significant role of widening the landscape of the higher education. In the past, along with high demand for higher education, many universities in the United States established their branch campuses in foreign countries. According to a report by the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education (OBHE), there was a 43% increase in the number of foreign branch campuses in the worldwide scale since 2006. American higher education institutions mostly take a dominant position in growth rate and the number of foreign branch campuses, accounting for almost 50% of current foreign branch campuses. However, some research reports have recently said foreign branch campuses are facing several challenges and setbacks, for example interference of local government,
sustainability problems, and long-term prospects like damage on academic reputations and finance.

==Challenges for foreign students in English-speaking countries==

Most foreign students encounter difficulties in language use. Such issues make it difficult for the student to make domestic friends and gain familiarity with the local culture. Sometimes, these language barriers can subject international students to ignorance or disrespect from native speakers. Most international students also lack support groups in the country where they are studying. Although all colleges in North America that are in student exchange programs do have an International Student Office, it sometimes does not have the resources and capability to consider their students&#x27; individual needs when it comes to adapting to the new environment. The more students a particular college has who come from the same country, the better the support is for getting involved in the new culture.

Foreign students face several challenges in their academic studies at North American universities. Studies have shown that these challenges include several different factors: inadequate English proficiency; unfamiliarity with North American culture; lack of appropriate study skills or strategies; academic learning anxiety; low social self-efficacy; financial difficulties; and separation from family and friends. Despite the general perception that American culture is diverse rather than homogenous, the American ideology of cultural homogeneity has been alleged to imply an American mindset that because Eurocentric cultures are superior to others, people with different cultures should conform to the dominant monocultural canon and norms.

US colleges and universities have long welcomed students from China, whose higher education system cannot meet the demand. 10 million students throughout China take the national college entrance test, competing for 5.7 million university places. Because foreign undergraduates typically fail to qualify for US federal aid, colleges can provide only limited financial help. Now, thanks to China&#x27;s booming economy in recent years, more Chinese families can afford to pay.

US colleges also face challenges abroad. Worries about fraud on test scores and transcripts make occasional headlines. And even Chinese students who score highly on an English-language proficiency test may not be able to speak or write well enough to stay up to speed in a US classroom, where essay writing and discussions are common. Chinese international students face other challenges besides language proficiency. The Chinese educational structure focuses on exam-oriented education, with educational thinking and activities aimed towards meeting the entrance examination. Students become more focused on exam performance, and teachers are inclined to focus on lecturing to teach students what may be on the test. In addition, &quot;parents are also convinced that the more students listened to the lectures, the better they would score on the finals.&quot; With more than 304,040 Chinese students enrolled in the US in 2014/15, China is by far the leading source of international students at American universities and colleges; however, there are three waves of growth in Chinese students in the US.

Each of the three waves differs in terms of needs and expectations and corresponding support services needed. Unfortunately, many higher education institutions have not adapted to the changing needs. It is no surprise that many Chinese students are now questioning if it is worth investing in studying abroad.

International students also face cross-cultural barriers that hinder their ability to succeed in a new environment. For example, there are differences in terms of receiving and giving feedback, which influences academic engagement and even the job and internship search approach of international students.

Transparency is an issue that international students face when coming across activities within class, specifically when it comes to group discussions, it may be a bigger obstacle. Firstly, the issue of how topics being discussed may not need further elaboration when it comes to local students and for an international student, the ability of the student to be able to understand and contribute may diminish in return. This may be due to the feeling of dismissal via the appearance of lack of interest in their opinion. Another would be the failure of expected scaffolding during group discussions when it comes to international students. This is due to the need for a developed understanding of local culture, or &quot;cultural facts&quot; as represented by Kim. This represents the knowledge of humor, vernacular, or simple connotations in speech that may allow international students to further develop an understanding of a given topic.

Plagiarism is the most serious offense in academia. Plagiarism has two subtle forms, one of which includes the omission of elements required for proper citations and references. The second form is unacknowledged use or incorporation of another person&#x27;s work or achievement. Violation of either form can result in a student&#x27;s expulsion. International students from some cultures lack the concept of plagiarism. Most of them are unfamiliar with American academic standards and colleges are not good about giving a clear definition of the word&#x27;s meaning. For example, many international students don&#x27;t know using even one sentence of someone else&#x27;s work can be considered plagiarism. Most colleges give students an E on their plagiarized assignments and future offenses often result in failing class or being kicked out of university.

=== Mental wellness ===
International students studying in a foreign country face a life-altering event which can cause distress that can potentially affect their mental wellness. Many students report homesickness and loneliness in their initial transition, experience isolation from peers and struggle with understanding cultural differences while staying abroad. In certain cultures, mental illness is seen as a sign of weakness. Because of this, international students believe they can prevail through their struggles alone without help, which can lead to a decrease in mental wellness.

There are two common symptoms among international students from China in particular: 45% of the students faced depression and 29% of the students faced anxiety. Stressors that lead international students to struggle with anxiety are rooted in numerous causes, including academic pressures, financial issues, adapting to a new culture, creating friendships, and feelings of loneliness. International students are also more likely to rely on peers for support through their transition than teachers or adult peers. If the student is unable to make friends in their new environment, they will struggle more with their transition than an international student who has established relationships with their peers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many international students started remote learning and had to overcome time differences to take classes online, which further led to sleep disruption, social isolation, and thus, higher rates of mental health symptoms.

Language and communication barriers have been noted to add to student anxiety and stress. International students face language discrimination, which may exacerbate mental health symptoms. Evidence has not conclusively shown that language discrimination is a greater risk factor than discrimination against foreigners. However, there has not been any conclusive evidence to show whether language discrimination plays a significantly larger role than simple foreigner discrimination.

Since international students are less likely to use individual counseling provided by the university. and may experience even more intense stigmas against seeking professional help, group-oriented ways of reaching students may be more helpful. Group activities, like collaborative workshops and cultural exchange groups, can introduce a sense of community among the students. In addition, efforts can be placed to improve awareness and accessibility to mental wellness resources and counseling services. Social workers, faculty, and academic staff can be educated beforehand to provide an adequate support for them.

==Study abroad==
Studying abroad is the act of a student pursuing educational opportunities in a country other than one&#x27;s own. This can include primary, secondary and post-secondary students. A 2012 study showed number of students studying abroad represents about 9.4% of all students enrolled at institutions of higher education in the United States and it is a part of experience economy.

Studying abroad is a valuable program for international students as it is intended to increase the students&#x27; knowledge and understanding of other cultures. International education not only helps students with their language and communicating skills. It also encourages students to develop a different perspective and cross-cultural understanding of their studies which will further their education and benefit them in their career. The main factors that determine the outcome quality of international studies are transaction dynamics (between the environmental conditions and the international student), quality of environment, and the student&#x27;s coping behavior.

=== Accommodation ===

Accommodation is a major factor that determines study abroad experience.

=== Coping in study abroad ===

==== Positive affectivity ====

Affectivity is an emotional disposition: people who are high on positive affectivity experience positive emotions and moods like joy and excitement, and view the world, including themselves and other people, in a positive light. They tend to be cheerful, enthusiastic, lively, sociable, and energetic. Research has found that students studying abroad with a positive emotional tendency have higher satisfaction and interaction with the environment; they engage in the staying country&#x27;s citizenship behaviours.

==== Adjustment concepts ====
Being relevant to research on coping by international students, the concept of adjustment to a foreign work environment and its operationalisation has been the subject of broad methodological discussion.

<text>The Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC), founded in 1962, is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. Member institutions are located in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, and Texas. Difficulties related to travel distances led seven former members to announce the formation of a new Southeastern US-based conference, the Southern Athletic Association, starting with the 2012–13 academic year.

Prior to 1991, the conference was known as the College Athletic Conference (CAC). The commissioner of the SCAC is Dwayne Hanberry. The chair of the Executive Committee of the SCAC for 2022–23 is L. Song Richardson, Colorado College president.

===Membership timeline===
 

==Conference overview==
Prior to the 2012 conference split, the SCAC fielded competition in baseball, basketball, cross country, field hockey, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, outdoor track and field and volleyball. With membership greatly reduced and in flux, some of these sports (field hockey, women&#x27;s lacrosse) no longer have enough participants (zero and two, respectively) to allow the conference to sponsor them. In addition, after struggling with only four football playing schools for several seasons, the conference in November 2015 announced football would be discontinued as a conference sport effective the 2017–18 school year, with football playing institutions affiliating with either the American Southwest Conference or the Southern Athletic Association. On July 21, 2018, the conference announced that men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse would once again be offered as conference sports, and made a commitment to holding an eSports championship in 2019. With only four schools fielding women&#x27;s lacrosse teams, and five men&#x27;s, the conference champions will not qualify for an automatic bid to the NCAA playoffs.

Unlike many Division III conferences, where geography is the primary determining factor for membership, the SCAC is made up of private institutions where the primary focus is on academics; the New England Small College Athletic Conference and University Athletic Association are other athletic associations with similar academic emphasis. Almost all members sport Phi Beta Kappa chapters. Member schools are prominently featured in annual &quot;Best College&quot; rankings; admissions are highly selective.

In an unusual move for the conference, Colorado College, which offers two Division I (scholarship) sports, was accepted as a member beginning in the 2006–07 season. It is the only SCAC school to offer any sort of scholarship athletics, though the Division I programs—namely men&#x27;s ice hockey and women&#x27;s soccer—do not compete in the SCAC. (The conference does not sponsor ice hockey for either men or women.)

The conference had previously announced its desire to expand to a total of twelve members, which would ease scheduling issues and allow the conference to divide into eastern and western divisions spread across the southern US. On May 26, 2006, Birmingham-Southern College, one of the smallest Division I schools in the country, announced its intentions to drop scholarship athletics and join the SCAC. This is a multi-year process subject to final approval by the NCAA. The SCAC approved BSC&#x27;s application, pending NCAA approval, on June 8, 2006.

Due to the unusual (for Division III) distances between member institutions, travel costs and durations must be factored into any decision to join the conference. Rose–Hulman cited these factors as reasons for leaving the conference when it rejoined the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference in 2006–07. Austin College readily took RHIT&#x27;s place, moving from the American Southwest Conference before the 2006–07 season.

On June 9, 2010, DePauw University announced that it was departing the SCAC for the North Coast Athletic Conference. Like Rose-Hulman, DePauw cited &quot;a less strenuous and more environmentally friendly travel regimen for our teams.&quot; DePauw became a member of the NCAC for the 2011–12 season except for football, which will join for the 2012 season.

On September 22, 2010, the University of Dallas announced that it had accepted an invitation to join the SCAC at the beginning of the 2011–12 academic year.

The May 10, 2011 issue of the DePauw college newspaper, &quot;The DePauw&quot;, reported that four schools (Centre, , Hendrix, and Rhodes) were considering leaving the conference at the end of the 2011–2012 school year, ostensibly due to travel issues and issues relating to the conference splitting into two divisions. As the two reasons were somewhat exclusive (e.g. divisions would reduce overall travel), and other regional conferences would offer similar issues, it remained to be seen at that time what the schools planned in a post-SCAC world.

After the conclusion of the June 7, 2011 SCAC Presidents&#x27; meeting, the conference announced that seven of the twelve schools would be leaving to form a new, more compact conference based in the Southeastern US. This transition was effective at the conclusion of the 2011–12 academic year. The schools departing include founding SCAC [CAC] members Centre, Sewanee, and Rhodes, in addition to Birmingham-Southern, Hendrix, Millsaps, and Oglethorpe. Berry College will also join the newly formed Southern Athletic Association.

The SCAC intends to remain a viable entity, enlisting other schools which subscribe to the SCAC charter. Commissioner D. Dwayne Hanberry will remain with the conference to oversee that effort, which will be complicated by the paucity of unaffiliated Division III schools in the SCAC&#x27;s new region of Texas and Colorado. Reflecting that challenge, the conference has sought new members from the American Southwest Conference, whose geographical footprint is similar to that of the &quot;new&quot; SCAC. On September 28, 2011, Centenary College of Louisiana announced it would join the SCAC beginning in the 2012–13 season. Two more ASC schools joined the SCAC for the 2013–14 season: Schreiner University announced their decision on January 23, 2012, and on February 16, 2012, Texas Lutheran University announced it too would join the SCAC.

Football was no longer be sponsored by the SCAC as of the 2017–18 school year. The conference had four schools playing in 2015 and 2016: Texas Lutheran University, Austin College, Southwestern University and Trinity University. Texas Lutheran University and Southwestern University will play football as affiliates in the ASC, while Austin College and Trinity University will be affiliates of the Southern Athletic Association.

A much-needed travel partner for isolated Colorado College will join the conference in 2018. On February 21, 2017, the conference announced that the Denver campus of Johnson &amp; Wales University would join the conference as it transitions from the NAIA to NCAA Division III, after the school&#x27;s &quot;exploratory year&quot; in 2017–18. It is expected that the school will not be eligible for conference championships or NCAA playoff bids until the transition to Division III is complete, per typical NCAA practice. The conference has already announced plans to pursue a tenth institution to better balance travel and scheduling requirements.

On February 14, 2018, the University of St. Thomas - Houston announced it would become the SCAC&#x27;s 10th member after completing an exploratory year in Division III. SCAC competition would begin in the 2019–2020 season.

On June 25, 2020, Johnson &amp; Wales University announced that it would close its Denver campus at the end of the 2020–21 school year due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and would accept no new students at that campus effective immediately. The following day, the Denver athletic program was shut down.

On October 31, 2022, the conference announced that McMurry University, currently an affiliate in Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Swimming and Diving, will join the conference as a full member starting with the 2024–25 season, becoming the latest school to leave the American Southwest Conference for the SCAC. As McMurry offers football, there was speculation that the conference might once again sponsor the sport; two days later, the conference announced it would reinstate football in 2024 as long as at least four members agree to participate in SCAC play. Austin, Southwestern, Texas Lutheran, and Trinity all are affiliated with other conferences for football and will have to complete any commitments before returning to the SCAC; in addition to McMurry, Centenary and Schreiner have nascent programs which could be ready to compete by 2024. Finally the SCAC also announced that Lyon College will join as an associate for football only in 2024. The conference expects Lyon, Austin, Centenary, and McMurry at a minimum in 2024 with the other schools having until 2026 to return to SCAC play. The conference&#x27;s football champion will not earn an automatic bid to the NCAA playoffs until the first year six teams participate in SCAC competition.

On March 9, 2023, the conference&#x27;s plans to restart football were somewhat complicated by the announcement that Trinity and Southwestern would leave the SCAC in favor of the Southern Athletic Association with the beginning of the 2025-26 school year. While the conference will retain enough football-playing schools to receive an automatic bid (if and only the remaining six teams meet their commitments to play football at that time), it may give the conference reason to join forces with the American Southwest Conference, which by that time will only have four schools participating in the sport and thus lack the minimum number of teams to receive an automatic playoff bid.

==President&#x27;s Trophy==
Each year, the &quot;President&#x27;s Trophy,&quot; a 300-pound railroad bell, is awarded to the school with the best overall sports record. Teams are awarded points for their final position in each sport; the school with the most points is declared the winner. For the 2021–22 school year, the President&#x27;s Trophy was awarded to Trinity University for the 22nd time, and eleventh-straight season, both conference records.

This list does not include championships won by schools outside of their period of membership in the SCAC.
==Overall success on the national level==
While championships come infrequently, overall SCAC athletic programs rate favorably when compared against the diverse Division III membership. The Learfield IMG College Directors&#x27; Cup provides one representation of any school&#x27;s athletic success as compared to its peers. Trinity has ranked in the top five nationally twice, most recently in 2004–05 when it placed fourth. Trinity again led the way in 2021–22 when it placed 20th nationally; Colorado College, at 102nd, was the next school among 327 ranked institutions.

==The SCAC and Division I==
On several occasions the SCAC has been used as a role model for academically high-achieving Division I programs considering a move to non-scholarship athletics. In 2004, Rice considered a move to Division III with Trinity cited as a possible model by the Houston Chronicle. The university eventually remained in Division I. In 2006, Birmingham-Southern College elected to leave Division I for Division III, and stated that they would seek membership in the SCAC. This represented the first time since 1988 that a Division I school had changed affiliation to Division III. In 2012, Centenary College of Louisiana joined the SCAC, after leaving Division I in 2011; however, its initial partner in the transition from Division I was the American Southwest Conference.

<doc id="262482" wikidata="Q236005" url="?curid=262482" title="Mel B">
<text>Melanie Janine Brown, MBE (born 29 May 1975), commonly known as Mel B or Melanie B, is an English singer, songwriter, television personality, and actress. She rose to fame in the mid 1990s as a member of the pop group the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Scary Spice. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, the Spice Girls are the best-selling female group of all time. The group went on an indefinite hiatus in 2000, before reuniting for a greatest hits album (2007) and two concert tours: the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019). 

Mel B debuted as a solo artist in 1998 with the release of &quot;I Want You Back&quot; which peaked atop the UK Singles Chart. Her debut solo studio album, &quot;Hot&quot; (2000), produced the successful singles &quot;Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Feels So Good&quot;. Her second studio album, &quot;L.A. State of Mind&quot; (2005), spawned the single &quot;Today&quot;. Mel B released &quot;For Once in My Life&quot; in 2013, her first single in eight years; it peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Songs chart.

Since 2007, Mel B has established herself as a television personality and talent show judge. She participated on the fifth season of the American dance competition series &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (2007), finishing in second place with her professional partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy. Between 2011 and 2016, Mel B served as a guest and main judge on the Australia and UK shows of &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In 2012, she co-presented the Australian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; for one season. Mel B has also judged on &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2013–2018, 2025–present), &quot;The Voice Kids Australia&quot; (2014), &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot; (2022–2023), &quot;Queen of the Universe&quot; (2023), and &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent: Fantasy League&quot; (2024). From 2016 to 2018, she co-presented &quot;Lip Sync Battle UK&quot; alongside rapper Professor Green.

Mel B was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to charitable causes.

==Early life==
Melanie Janine Brown was born in Harehills, Leeds, and grew up in the Burley area of the city, the daughter of Martin Brown and wife Andrea Dixon, daughter of Stanley Dixon and wife Eileen Mary English. Her father was from Saint Kitts and Nevis and her mother is English. Through her mother, Mel B is a first cousin of actor and director Christian Cooke; Cooke&#x27;s mother Di and Mel B&#x27;s mother Andrea are sisters. Mel B studied performing arts at Intake High School in Rodley, Leeds before entering the entertainment industry. For a time, she worked as a dancer in Blackpool, Lancashire.

==Career==
===1994–2000: Spice Girls===
In 1994, Mel B, along with Melanie C, Geri Halliwell and Victoria Beckham responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot; magazine. Around 400 women who answered the advertisement attended auditions at Danceworks Studios in Mayfair, London. Halliwell, Melanie C, Beckham, Mel B, and Michelle Stephenson were originally chosen as the members of the group which was known as Touch. Stephenson later left and was replaced by Emma Bunton. 

The group were unsatisfied with their original management, Heart Management, and broke with them. In 1995, they toured record labels in London and Los Angeles. After teaming up with music manager Simon Fuller, they signed a deal with Virgin Records and the group name was changed to Spice Girls. Their debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;, was a worldwide commercial success. The album peaked at number one in more than 17 countries and was certified multi-platinum in 27 countries. The group&#x27;s massive and sudden popularity was compared to Beatlemania. In total the album sold 30 million copies worldwide and became the biggest-selling album in music history by a girl group and one of the most successful albums of all time. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Wannabe&quot;, reached number one in 37 countries and all of the subsequent singles from the album – &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot; – also peaked at number one in United Kingdom.

In 1997, they released their second album, &quot;Spiceworld&quot;. The album&#x27;s first two singles &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and &quot;Too Much&quot; reached number one in the UK, marking seven consecutive number one singles, an all-time record for a musical group. The album was a global best seller, selling 20 million copies worldwide. The group also starred in their own film, &quot;Spiceworld: The Movie&quot;, which grossed $100 million worldwide. The third single from &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, peaked at two, breaking the group&#x27;s sequence of number ones. &quot;Viva Forever&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s final single in July 1998. The single was another number one and was the group&#x27;s first single released following Halliwell&#x27;s departure from the group in May 1998. 

Mel B debuted as a solo artist in September 1998 with the release of &quot;I Want You Back&quot;. The single charted at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart and also had success around the globe. The song was recorded for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. The single sold 218,000 copies and became the 82nd Bestselling British Single of the year. In late 1998, the Spice Girls released &quot;Goodbye&quot; as a four-piece. It topped the UK Singles Chart and became their third consecutive Christmas number-one – equaling the record previously set by The Beatles.

===1999–2004: &quot;Hot&quot; and acting===
In 1999, Mel B began recording her debut album, working with producers Sisqó, Teddy Riley, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the latter of whom she was also working with on the Spice Girls&#x27; third album, &quot;Forever&quot;. At the suggestion of her then-husband Jimmy Gulzar, Brown covered Cameo&#x27;s 1986 hit &quot;Word Up&quot; as her next solo release. The track was included on the soundtrack to &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;. The song charted poorly, peaking at fourteen on the UK Singles Chart, making it the lowest-charting Spice Girls-related single of the &#x27;90s. Turning to television work, she hosted &quot;Pure Naughty&quot;, a weekly BBC2 magazine show focusing on black music. She hosted the MOBO Awards on two occasions, in 1998 with Bill Bellamy and in 1999 with Wyclef Jean, and took part in the BBC-funded short film &quot;Fish&quot;. She hosted a number of TV shows such as &quot;This Is My Moment&quot; (a talent show) for ITV1 and shot a documentary called &quot;Voodoo Princess&quot; for Channel 4. She took part in smaller projects as a presenter such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, Party in the Park for The Prince&#x27;s Trust and &quot;The All Star Animal Awards&quot;. She appeared as herself in an advert for the Yorkshire tourist board in a series which included contributions from other Yorkshire-born celebrities, and in the film &quot;Happy Birthday Oscar Wilde&quot;.

Mel B&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hot&quot; was released in October 2000, a month before the final Spice Girls album &quot;Forever&quot; was released. Following the release of &quot;Forever&quot;, which was far less successful than their previous two albums, the Spice Girls stopped recording and the members began investing more time into their solo careers. &quot;Hot&quot; was not a success and garnered mediocre reviews, selling a disappointing 7,419 copies in its first week and charting at No. 28. &quot;Hot&quot; was preceded by the lead single &quot;Tell Me&quot; in September 2000. &quot;Tell Me&quot; debuted at No. 4 in the UK charts with about 40,000 copies sold in its first week of release. It sold approximately 100,000 copies, making it the 158th &quot;best seller&quot; of 2000. In February 2001, &quot;Feels So Good&quot; was released as the second single from the album and peaked at No. 5. It followed by &quot;Lullaby&quot; in June, a pop number dedicated to her daughter. It was accompanied by a video shot in Morocco and featured Mel B with Phoenix Chi. The media criticised Mel B for using her child in the music video and single artwork, labeling her &quot;Desperate Spice&quot; and insinuating that she was exploiting her child as a marketing tool. The single entered and peaked at No. 13. Mel B left Virgin records in July 2001. 

In 2002, Mel B released her autobiography, &quot;Catch a Fire&quot;, which reached No. 7 in the official books chart, and saw her touring the UK to promote it with a run of book signings. In 2003 Mel B&#x27;s first movie role came in the form of a British drama, &quot;Burn It.&quot; She acted in a long run of shows as part of the cast for &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. She was in the movie &quot;The Seat Filler&quot;, co-produced by Will Smith and starring Destiny&#x27;s Child star Kelly Rowland. In April 2004, Mel B took part in the musical &quot;Rent&quot; as Mimi Marquez in Netherlands.

After &quot;Rent&quot;, Mel B began recording new songs and decided to release them through an independent label, Amber Café. Mel B said that she was working on acoustic music in contrast with her previous releases. The resulting album, &quot;LA State of Mind&quot;, was released on 27 June 2005. It was released with a bonus DVD featuring an in-depth documentary filmed and directed by Mark McConnell. In a scathing review, AllMusic stated that this album was one of the worst pop albums of the decade. The only single from the album, &quot;Today&quot;, saw a UK release in June 2005. &quot;Today&quot; entered the singles chart at No. 41, selling around 1,000 copies in its first week. The same year, Mel B appeared in the films &quot;Telling Lies&quot; and &quot;LD 50 Lethal Dose&quot;. In 2006, Mel B appeared in the short film &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot;.

However, Seven, the Australian TV network that airs &quot;The X Factor Australia&quot;, filed suit to prevent Mel B from appearing on &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and any rival networks. The judge ruled that Mel B was still under contract with Seven until January 2014, which prevented her from appearing on a program aired by another network until after that date.

From 1996 to 1997, Mel B dated the Icelandic businessman Fjölnir Thorgeirsson. 

In March 1998, Mel B began a relationship with the Dutch dancer Jimmy Gulzar while on the Spiceworld Tour. They became engaged on 13 May 1998, Mel B became pregnant that June, and the couple were married in Little Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on 13 September 1998. Mel B changed her stage name to Melanie G while they were married. Their daughter, Phoenix Chi Gulzar, was born on 19 February 1999. Mel B filed for divorce in 2000, and the divorce was finalised later that year. Mel B won custody, and paid a settlement of £1.25m to Gulzar. Gulzar was prosecuted for threatening Mel B and attacking her sister, Danielle. In August 2001, Gulzar was found guilty of the assault, but later cleared by the court.

From 2000 to 2002, Mel B was in a relationship with actor Max Beesley. 

From 2002 to 2006, she was in a relationship with the film producer Christine Crokos. Mel B and Crokos lived together in Los Angeles, California. Speaking to &quot;Gay Star News&quot; about the relationship, she said: &#x27;It wasn&#x27;t experimentation. I fell in love with a woman for five years. An experiment doesn&#x27;t last five years.&#x27; Asked about the relationship, Mel B said: &quot;People call me lesbian, bisexual or heterosexual, but I know who&#x27;s in my bed and that&#x27;s it. I have a huge libido and a great sex life.&quot; Brown and Crokos&#x27;s relationship ended in 2006. Brown said that she had had a four-year relationship with a woman when she was in her teens. In a 2019 interview with Piers Morgan, Mel B was asked if she had slept with Halliwell in an intimate manner and she nodded yes. Halliwell released a statement saying that the press reports following the interview had been &quot;hurtful to her family&quot;. Brown later said: &quot;I just said it was like a little thing and we giggled about it the next day and that’s that. It&#x27;s the press [who] have taken it onto a whole new level.&quot;

Mel B became the subject of tabloid stories during her relationship with the Hollywood actor Eddie Murphy, who is the biological father of Mel B&#x27;s second child, Angel Iris Murphy Brown, born 3 April 2007. By early December 2006, Mel B and Murphy had separated. Murphy told a journalist that the parentage of Mel B&#x27;s then-unborn baby could not be proven until a paternity test was performed. On 22 June 2007, a court-ordered DNA test confirmed that Murphy was the child&#x27;s father. Murphy admitted paternity and indicated that he and Mel B had reached a paternity settlement of $7 million.

Mel B filed for divorce in March 2017, and accused Belafonte of emotional and physical abuse. In court, Belafonte&#x27;s representative said that due to the couple&#x27;s &quot;extravagant and affluent&quot; lifestyle, Brown had &quot;wiped out all her Spice Girls money – approximately $50 million (£38.3 million), if not more&quot;. The divorce was finalised on 15 December 2017. Mel B cited her divorce from Belafonte and her father&#x27;s death as her reasons for seeking treatment for PTSD.

<doc id="262484" wikidata="Q1100795" url="?curid=262484" title="Cleveland Hopkins International Airport">
<text>Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is a city-owned international airport in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, and is the primary airport serving Greater Cleveland and Northeast Ohio. It is the largest and busiest airport in the state, as well as in the top fifty largest airports in the U.S. by passenger numbers. Located in Cleveland&#x27;s Hopkins neighborhood southwest of Downtown Cleveland, it is adjacent to the Glenn Research Center, one of NASA&#x27;s ten major field centers.

The airport has been at the forefront of several innovations that are now commonplace. It was the first airport with an air traffic control tower and a two-level design separating arrivals from departures. It was also the first airport in North America to be directly connected with a rail transit line.

Cleveland was a hub for United Airlines from the post–World War II era until the mid-1980s. After United moved out, Continental Airlines moved in, making it the dominant carrier at the airport in the 1990s and 2000s. After United and Continental merged in 2010, United closed the Cleveland hub, though it still has a flight attendant base, pilot base, and maintenance facilities at the airport and is its largest carrier by passenger count.

When United stopped using Cleveland as a hub, it closed Concourse D, but the airline kept paying to lease the facility. However, United&#x27;s hub closure created an opening for low-cost carriers to enter the market, which had previously had among the highest average fares in the country. Within a few years after United closed the hub, passenger traffic rebounded to where it was before the closure.

Cleveland Hopkins offers non-stop passenger service to 43 destinations. Cleveland Hopkins is operated by the Cleveland Department of Port Control, which also operates Burke Lakefront Airport located downtown.

==History==
Cleveland Hopkins is of particular importance to the history of commercial air travel due to a number of first-in-the-world innovations that would eventually become the global standard. Founded on July 1, 1925, it was one of the first municipality-owned facilities of its kind in the United States. It was the site of the first air traffic control tower (1929), the first ground-to-air radio control system (1939), and the first airfield lighting system (1930),; and it was the first U.S. airport to be directly connected to a local or regional rail transit system (1968).

It was also the first airport to employ a two-level terminal design separating arrivals from departures. The airport was named after its founder, former city manager William R. Hopkins, on his 82nd birthday in 1951.

===First closure of United hub, establishment of Continental hub===
United Airlines established its easternmost domestic hub in Cleveland after World War II, which it maintained until the mid-1980s, when it closed its Cleveland hub and moved capacity to a new hub at Washington–Dulles. Following the closure of the United hub, Continental Airlines (which at the time was a separate carrier and lacked a Midwest hub) responded by adding capacity to Cleveland, as did USAir, which was the dominant carrier at the airport from 1987 until the early 1990s. While USAir soon reduced its schedule from Cleveland, Continental substantially increased its hub capacity, becoming the airport&#x27;s largest tenant and eventually accounting for upwards of 60 percent of passenger traffic. Continental and the airport both made substantial operational and capital investments in the airport&#x27;s infrastructure. In 1992, the airport completed a $50 million renovation of Concourse C, which housed all of Continental&#x27;s flights. The renovation included the installation of a continuous skylight, a Continental President&#x27;s Club lounge, and a new Baggage Claim area. In 1999, the airport completed an $80 million expansion that included the construction of the new Concourse D (now closed), which was built to accommodate Continental Express and Continental Connection flights.

In June 1999, Continental Airlines launched flights to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport aboard a Boeing 757-200. This was Cleveland&#x27;s first scheduled transatlantic service. The carrier suspended the link after the September 11 attacks and resumed it in April 2002. The following year, Continental made the route seasonal.

Continental began flying into London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport instead of Gatwick in May 2009; Heathrow offered more connecting flights. The airline discontinued the service four months later, citing the recession and an inability to obtain affordable seasonal slots at Heathrow. The company was also about to join the Star Alliance, to which United Airlines belonged. Consequently, London-bound passengers would be able to transit through United&#x27;s Chicago hub instead of Cleveland. The cancellation of the route left the city without a direct link to Europe until 2018.

===Continental–United merger, second closure of United hub===
In 2010, Continental and United Airlines announced that they would merge operations. The merger prompted concerns that a post-merger United would reduce or close its hub in Cleveland and instead route passengers through the new United&#x27;s Chicago-O&#x27;Hare and Washington-Dulles hubs. On November 10, 2010, Continental CEO Jeff Smisek stated in a speech in Cleveland that &quot;Cleveland needs to earn its hub status every day&quot; and added that overall profitability would be the determining factor in whether the new United kept or closed the Cleveland hub.

United continued to reduce its capacity in Cleveland following the merger, which already had been substantially reduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. On February 1, 2014, United announced that the airline would shut down its Cleveland hub, stating as justification that the airline&#x27;s hub at Cleveland &quot;hasn&#x27;t been profitable for over a decade.&quot; By June 5, 2014, United had effectively terminated its hub operation at the airport, reducing its daily departures by more than 60%. United also closed Concourse D and consolidated all of its remaining operations in Concourse C, although it is required to continue to pay the airport $1,112,482 a month in rent for the facility until 2027.

===Post-hub history===
The airport initially experienced a sharp decline in passenger counts following the closure of United&#x27;s hub in 2014. Several other airlines, however, increased their service to Cleveland in subsequent years. Frontier Airlines significantly increased its service to the airport and declared Cleveland a focus city. New routes connected Cleveland with destinations as far as Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In November 2023, Frontier Airlines announced it would make Cleveland a crew base in March 2024, employing up to 110 pilots, 250 flight attendants, and 50 aircraft maintenance personnel.

Other low-cost airlines such as Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air began new service to the airport as well, and existing airlines such as American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and Southwest Airlines also increased their number of daily flights and destinations. As a result, by 2017, the airport&#x27;s passenger count exceeded levels achieved during the last full year that United maintained a hub in Cleveland.

Despite the closure of its hub, as of 2017 United still maintained roughly 1,200 employees in Greater Cleveland, including a flight attendant and pilot base as well as maintenance facilities. United also remains the largest carrier at Hopkins. Regional airline CommuteAir, which flies exclusively on behalf of United Express, is headquartered in nearby North Olmsted.

Icelandair and Wow Air inaugurated flights to Reykjavík in May 2018. Wow Air employed Airbus A321s on the route, while Icelandair used a Boeing 737 MAX. Wow Air left Cleveland in October 2018 amid financial troubles. Icelandair decided to make its service seasonal, with the first season ending in October. In March 2019, however, the carrier announced it would not be returning. The Boeing 737 MAX had been grounded, and some analysts said Icelandair might have been dissatisfied with the route&#x27;s performance.

In 2021, the airport received $32.5 million from the Federal Aviation Administration to provide economic relief funds for costs related to operations, personnel, cleaning, sanitization, janitorial services, debt service payments, and combating the spread of pathogens during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2023, Aer Lingus launched flights between Cleveland and Dublin on Airbus A321LR aircraft. It is currently the only nonstop transatlantic flight between Europe and Cleveland.

In 2023, Cleveland was one of the areas where United Airlines pilots picketed in pursuit of a better contract.

Frontier overtook United for the #1 spot in passengers carried monthly in June 2024.

==Facilities==

===Terminal===
Cleveland Hopkins consists of one two-level passenger terminal, which was completed in 1978, and renovated in 2016. There are four concourses, three of which are currently in use.
*Concourse A houses Frontier, Spirit, charters, and all international arrivals. Delta Air Lines also uses it for overflow parking and sports charters. It also houses the airport&#x27;s Federal Inspection Services (FIS) customs and border protection facility. Originally known as &quot;North Concourse&quot;, it was opened in 1957 and rebuilt in 1978–79.
*Concourse B houses Delta and Southwest. Originally the “West Concourse”, it was built in 1954 as the first extension pier to the airport, and was rebuilt and expanded from 1982 to 1983. 
*Concourse C houses Air Canada Express, Alaska, American, JetBlue and all United services, except for international arrivals which are handled in Concourse A. Originally known as &quot;South Concourse&quot;, it opened in 1969 and was renovated in 1992.
*Concourse D has been vacant since 2014, when United closed its gates and consolidated all operations to Concourse C. Built in 1999, it is a separate terminal connected to Concourse C by an underground walkway. Although capable of handling larger jets such as the Boeing 737, it exclusively handled smaller regional aircraft during its operation. Concourse D contains 12 jet bridge gates and 24 ramp loading positions.

In 2022, the airport began discussions for a $2 billion renovation. The airport wanted to expand security and check-in counters, add an improved checked baggage inspection system, expand gate waiting areas, and add 8 new gates to be able to accept additional flights. Concourses A and C will be renovated, concourse B would be rebuilt, and a new concourse would be built to replace Concourse D.

===Runways===
Cleveland Hopkins covers an area of and has three runways:
* 06R/24L: concrete
* 06L/24R: concrete
* 10/28: asphalt/concrete

===Other facilities===
Cleveland Hopkins is home to both crew and maintenance bases for United Airlines.

The airport is also home to one of five kitchens operated by airline catering company Chelsea Food Services, a subsidiary of United Airlines.

Cleveland Airmall, a unit of Fraport USA, manages the retail and dining locations at the airport. Tenants include Johnston &amp; Murphy, Great Lakes Brewing Company, Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Museum Store, Bar Symon, and Sunglass Hut.

A former Sheraton Hotel also occupies the airport grounds immediately east of the terminal. Built in 1959, it had 243 rooms and was a popular layover point for passengers and crews during the airport’s hub days with United and Continental. The hotel closed in June 2022 after its ownership group defaulted on its loans. The airport subsequently acquired the building and intends to demolish it in 2024.

The airport has two lounges: a United Club in Concourse C and The Club CLE near the entrance to Concourse B in the Main Terminal.

===Ground transportation===
The airport is connected to the Cleveland Rapid Transit system with the Red Line Rapid Transit station beneath the terminal.
The airport has a dedicated taxi service of 110 vehicles. In 2023, the airport received $3.2 million in federal funding to renovate, among other terminal facilities, the public transportation tunnel to the airport. This will include modernizing wall surfaces, replacing the tunnel ceiling and waterproof membrane in the tunnel tramway, structural repairs, and installation of a new drainage system.

Rental car operations are located at a consolidated rental car facility off the airport property. Shuttle services are provided between the airport and the facility.

=== Basic Aircraft Statistics ===
For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 91,615 aircraft operations, an average of 251 per day. This was 79% commercial, 14% air taxi, 7% general aviation, and &lt;1% military. For the same time period, 43 aircraft were based at the airport: 37 jets, 4 military aircraft, and 2 multi-engine airplanes.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On May 24, 1938, United Air Lines Flight 9, a Douglas DC-3 flying from Newark to Chicago via Cleveland crashed on approach to Cleveland killing all seven passengers and three crew members on board.
* On August 27, 1971, a Chicago &amp; Southern Airlines Volpar Turboliner (Beechcraft Model 18) with 2 occupants on board suffered a loss of power on the no.1 engine shortly after takeoff. It stalled and crashed killing 1 crew member of the 2 on board.
* On December 18, 1978, an Allegheny Commuter DeHavilland Heron (operated by Fischer Brothers Aviation) was landing at Cleveland from Mansfield Lahm Airport when a ground controller cleared a snow plow to cross the runway at the same time the aircraft was landing, resulting in a collision. The flight had a crew of 2 pilots and 15 passengers. There were no fatalities nor serious injuries. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. 
* On January 4, 1985, an armed 42-year-old Cleveland woman named Oranette Mays hijacked Pan Am flight 558, a Boeing 727 scheduled to fly from Cleveland to New York City&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport. During the boarding process for the flight in Cleveland, Mays shot her way onto the plane, shooting and injuring a USAir employee who tried to stop her in the process. Mays then commandeered the plane, took 7 hostages (including an 8-month-old baby), and demanded to be taken to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After a 6-hour stand-off, a SWAT team made up of Cleveland police and FBI agents stormed the plane. Mays and an officer were shot before police were able to arrest Mays.
* On February 17, 1991, Ryan International Airlines Flight 590, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 cargo flight bound for Indianapolis International Airport stalled and crashed after takeoff from CLE due to wing contamination. While the DC-9 was on the ground for 35 minutes, there was no de-icing service on the aircraft and blowing snow accumulated on the wings, causing a stall and loss of control on takeoff. Both occupants were killed.
* On December 15, 1992, a Mohican Air Service Volpar Turboliner II (Beechcraft Model 18) on a ferry flight crashed after its initial climb, the sole occupant was killed. Improper installation of the elevator during recent maintenance on the aircraft was the probable cause.
* On January 6, 2003, a Continental Express Embraer ERJ 145LR overran the runway upon landing from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, CT. The airplane continued beyond the departure end, on the extended runway centerline, and struck the ILS runway 6 localizer antenna. It came to rest with the nose about beyond the end of the runway. The nose landing gear had collapsed rearward and deformed the forward pressure bulkhead.
* On November 29, 2004, an Embraer EMB-135BJ sustained substantial damage during a ground collision with a parked airplane while taxiing after landing at the Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport. While exiting taxiway &quot;J&quot; with the co-pilot steering the airplane from the left seat, the airplane entered a ramp area where scheduled maintenance was to be performed. However, another EMB-135BJ had been parked perpendicular to the ramp entrance, with its nose wheel approximately 30 feet from the front of a hangar, and with its tail approximately 45 feet from the edge of the ramp pavement. According to written statements provided by the flight crew, per their standard operating procedures, they waited at the ramp entrance for a marshaller to assist them in parking. When one did not arrive, they decided to pass behind the parked airplane slowly, but while the pilot attempted to verbally direct the co-pilot and observe the position of the right wingtip, the airplane&#x27;s right winglet collided with the parked airplane. The probable cause of the incident was found to be the pilot in command&#x27;s improper decision to continue taxi without a ground marshaller, and her misjudged clearance from a parked airplane, which resulted in a ground collision during taxi.
* On February 18, 2007, Delta Connection Flight 6448, an Embraer E 170 operated by Shuttle America with 4 crew members and 71 passengers aboard, landed at CLE in snowy weather and gusty winds. Despite the use of full reverse and braking, the aircraft didn&#x27;t slow down, left the runway and partially went through a fence 150 feet from the end of the runway. There were no fatalities. Even though the aircraft was substantially damaged, it was repaired and put back into service.
* On July 26, 2016, a flight attendant on an Embraer E170 inbound to Cleveland Hopkins was injured after an inadvertent encounter with turbulence. The aircraft landed safely.
* On November 23, 2022, an area man broke onto airport property, drove onto a runway, and destroyed radar equipment at the airport.

==Controversies==
===Ground Transportation Center===
In May 2015, the airport moved the pick-up and drop off location for most shuttles to the former limo lot, requiring most passengers to take two escalators underneath the former shuttle parking in the arrivals lane at the airport. Originally meant to be a temporary fix, the airport made the Ground Transportation Center a permanent fixture in May 2017. This angered many travelers, who complained on various social media platforms, as well as local media outlets, garnering negative publicity for the airport&#x27;s plans. In March 2019, the pick up and drop off locations for most of the shuttles (except for limo shuttles) have moved to the north end of the baggage claim level.

===Parking===
In May 2013, the airport demolished its aging, 2,600-space Long Term Garage, replacing it with a 1,000 space surface lot for $24 million. This in turn created a parking shortage and daily lot closings when parking lots would become full. The airport&#x27;s Twitter account became a daily update of parking closures at the airport. The airport converted the Short Term Garage to a so-called Smart Garage and valet parking garage. The airport eliminated its free half-hour courtesy parking perk, and began to charge $3 for a half-hour.

<text>The University Athletic Association (UAA) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. Member schools are highly selective universities located in Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The eight members are Brandeis University, Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western Reserve University, Emory University, New York University, The University of Chicago, University of Rochester, and Washington University in St. Louis.

== Academics ==
All UAA member schools are private, and ranked in the top 50 of national research universities by U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s Best Colleges Rankings. Historically, the division was colloquially called the &quot;egghead eight&quot;, or &quot;nerdy nine&quot; when Johns Hopkins was a member. This stems both from the academic strength of the member schools, and the fact that the conference prioritizes academic achievement over athletic prowess.
The UAA was the only NCAA conference to have all of its member institutions affiliated with the Association of American Universities, a collection of 65 Ph.D.-granting research institutions, with 63 in the United States and two in Canada, from 2011, when Nebraska joined the previously all-AAU Big Ten, until 2019 when Dartmouth became the last Ivy League institution to join the AAU.

==History==
===Chronological timeline===
* 1986 - In 1986, the University Athletic Association (UAA) was founded. Charter members included Carnegie Mellon University, Case Western Reserve University, Emory University, Johns Hopkins University, New York University, The University of Chicago, the University of Rochester, and Washington University in St. Louis, effective beginning the 1986-87 academic year.
* 1987 - Brandeis University joined the UAA, effective in the 1987-88 academic year.
* 2001 - Johns Hopkins left the UAA to fully align all its sports into the Centennial Conference, effective after the 2000-01 academic year.
* 2018 - The UAA dropped football as a sponsored sport, due to its members joining on other athletic conferences for that sport as affiliates or associates, effective after the 2017 fall season (2017-18 academic year).

<doc id="262488" wikidata="Q652272" url="?curid=262488" title="MBS International Airport">
<text>MBS International Airport , located in Freeland, Michigan, is a commercial and general aviation airport serving the nearby cities of Midland, Bay City, and Saginaw. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

MBS was formerly named Tri-City Airport or Freeland Tri-City Airport, reflecting the “Tri-Cities” nickname of the region. The airport was renamed MBS International Airport in 1994 (representative of its IATA airport code) to prevent confusion with other airports named &quot;Tri-City Airport&quot; across the United States. While owned by three municipalities, the IATA and FAA city name associated with the airport is Saginaw, i.e. the control tower is known to pilots as &quot;Saginaw Tower&quot;.

The commercial airport is a special municipal body owned by Bay County and the cities of Midland and Saginaw. The airport&#x27;s name is an initialism formed from the names of these three communities and it is governed by a nine-member commission made up of three members from each of them.

In October 2012, MBS opened a new $55 million six-gate terminal to replace the old three-gate terminal, which was built in 1965. The construction on this project was completed nearly a year ahead of schedule.

The old terminal, which sat empty since October 2012, was demolished in 2017.

MBS International Airport enjoyed a robust 2018 with passenger numbers up 13 percent, and the airport was poised to embark on a major rehabilitation of its main runway to ring in the New Year.

In 2022, a credential authentication technology (CAT) unit was installed at MBS&#x27; TSA checkpoint. Passengers insert their ID into the machine themselves, reducing a touchpoint during the security process.

The airport is a sponsor of the Great Lakes Loons, a minor league baseball team affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers.

==History==

During World War II, the federal government bought land and began construction of the Tri-City Airport to be used for various air training projects. Helping maintain the field were German prisoners of war, who lived in barracks at the facility. After the war, the airport was turned over to the local governments. Civilian control of the airport resumed in the mid-1940s.

The current terminal on the north side of the air field opened on October 31, 2012. The terminal, which replaced an older terminal on the west side of the air field, was designed by RS&amp;H and cost $55 million. The Airport Commission approved plans for the construction of the state-of-the-art passenger terminal in 2006, with construction beginning in 2008. Airport officials hope the terminal will bring more airlines and more competition to MBS.

Air Force One landed at the airport twice during the 2004 United States presidential election for nearby rallies in support of George W. Bush. It landed again on September 10, 2020 for a campaign speech by then President Donald Trump, and most recently on March 14, 2024 for a campaign visit by President Joe Biden. Air Force One also visited the airport in 1974 when then President Richard M. Nixon made a speech at the airport and arrived to give endorsement to James Sparling, a Congressional candidate. Air Force Two also made an appearance in 1992 when Vice President Dan Quayle spoke from a hangar the day before the 1992 presidential election.

==Facilities and aircraft==
MBS International Airport covers and has two runways:
* Runway 5/23: , surface: asphalt
* Runway 14/32: , surface: asphalt

For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2017, the airport had 20,358 aircraft operations, an average of 77 per day. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2021, the airport had 13,500 aircraft operations per day, or 37/day. This 2021 figure includes 67% general aviation, 25% air taxi, 8% commercial, and 1% military.

In December 2017, there were 23 aircraft based at this airport: 11 jet, 7 multi-engine and 5 single-engine airplanes, and 1 helicopter. In 2021, there were 19 aircraft based at the field: 8 jet aircraft, 6 multi-engine and 4 single-engine airplanes, and 1 helicopter.

The airport has an FBO operated by AvFlight. Besides fuel, it offers general maintenance, oxygen, courtesy and rental cars, conference rooms, crew lounges, snooze rooms, and showers.

===Former airline service===
The 1980s and 1990s saw a lot of growth at MBS. During this time, airline service expanded and many airlines began serving MBS.
* Air Canada (Operated by Air Ontario) served MBS with its only International destination, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
* Allegiant Air began service to MBS in late 2011 with weekly MD-80 service to Orlando-Sanford though service was discontinued after less than a year. Allegiant Air began operating from Flint a few years later which is now an operating base for the airline.
* American Eagle Airlines operated Shorts 360 turboprop aircraft to Chicago O&#x27;Hare, as well as Lansing, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, and Traverse City. American left MBS in the late 1980s.
* Chicago Express Airlines, the now-defunct ATA Airlines carrier, served MBS in the early 1990s with daily service to Chicago Midway Airport using the Jetstream 31 turboprop aircraft.
* Delta Connection carrier Comair briefly linked MBS with its hub in Cincinnati using Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, a 30-seat turboprop in the mid-1990s. Comair left MBS and later started service in Flint in 2001. Delta Connection returned to MBS in 2010 after their merger with Northwest Airlines.
* Continental Airlines provided mainline service in the 1980s to its hub in Cleveland using McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737 aircraft. Mainline service was downgraded to Continental Express service in the late 1980s using Beechcraft 1900 turboprop aircraft. Service to Flint and Chicago Midway also existed in 1992. The airline left MBS in the mid-1990s and returned in 2002. Service was dropped to Cleveland again in 2003. 
* Republic Airlines began service to MBS in the 1960s linking MBS with Detroit using the DC-9 aircraft. During this time, Republic Express provided turboprop service to Flint, Grand Rapids, and Traverse City. Republic merged with Northwest Airlines in the 1980s, which became a major player at MBS. In their 20+ years at MBS, Northwest served Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul with a fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series aircraft along with the Boeing 727 and Airbus A319 &amp; A320. Northwest Airlink, Northwest&#x27;s regional brand, linked MBS to Flint, Lansing and Alpena throughout the 1980s with turboprop aircraft and eventually supported mainline Northwest with CRJ service to Detroit and Minneapolis. In 2008, Northwest operated a once daily nonstop to New York&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport in New York City using a CRJ-200 regional jet. Northwest Airlines subsequently merged with Delta Air Lines in 2010. Delta Connection, Delta&#x27;s regional brand, still serves MBS today with flights to Detroit.
* Skyway Airlines (The Midwest Express Connection) served MBS in the 1990s with service to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, using the Beechcraft 1900 turboprop aircraft. Skyway also tried service to Toronto, Flint, and Grand Rapids in the late 1990s. The airline pulled out in the late 1990s.
* United Airlines provided MBS with mainline service since commercial service was started. In the 1980s and 1990s, United linked MBS with Chicago using Boeing 737 and 727 aircraft. Service to Denver (via Stapleton International Airport), also existed in the 1980s. Mainline United left MBS in the 2001, and was replaced with United Express, which still serves MBS with service to Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare International Airport using mostly 50-seat aircraft.
* US Airways began service to MBS in 1996, operating Fokker 100 and Boeing 737 aircraft to its former hub in Pittsburgh. Mainline service ended soon after, and US Airways Express assumed the Pittsburgh flights using the Beech 1900 and Saab 340 aircraft. US Airways suspended service to MBS just two days after entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2002. At the time it was the only city for US Airways to drop. Eventually, US Airways also left Flint, Lansing, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rapids, leaving Detroit as the only Michigan destination served by US Airways.

==Current operations==
SkyWest Airlines runs ground services for United Express. United Express flies to Chicago O’Hare using mostly CRJ-200 aircraft. The CRJ-200 aircraft features 4 Economy Plus seats and 46 Economy seats. 

DAL Global Services operates ground handling duties for Delta Connection at MBS, which features both CRJ7 and CRJ9 aircraft. CRJ7 aircraft have 9 First Class, 16 Delta Comfort+, and 44 Main Cabin seats. CRJ9 aircraft have 12 First Class, 20 Delta Comfort+, and 38 Main Cabin seats. Flights are operated by Endeavor Air and occasionally SkyWest.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On April 6, 1958, Vickers Viscount N7437, operating Capital Airlines Flight 67, stalled and crashed on approach. All 47 on board were killed. The cause was attributed to ice accretion on the horizontal stabilizer.
* On August 16, 1987, a Northwest Airlines MD-80, Northwest Airlines Flight 255, originated at MBS. After departing MBS, the flight dropped off and picked up passengers at Detroit Metropolitan Airport before crashing on takeoff en route to Phoenix, Arizona, killing 148 passengers and six crew members. There was only one survivor.
*On May 30, 2016, a Cessna 170 was substantially damaged on landing at MBS International. The pilot reported that after a long straight-in final approach, as he reduced power for the landing flare, the airplane dropped &quot;flat&quot; and bounced hard on the runway. The pilot further reported that he added power to cushion the touchdown after the bounce, but the right main landing gear had collapsed after the initial impact. Subsequently, the airplane veered off the runway to the left and nosed over. The probable cause was found to be the pilot&#x27;s exceedance of the critical angle of attack during the landing flare, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall, hard landing, right main landing gear collapse, runway excursion, and nose over.
*On September 8, 2023, emergency crews first learned of issues on a twin engine Cessna 310 around 1 p.m. The airplane could not return to MBS, where it took off, for an unknown reason. The plane flew toward Harry Browne Airport in Saginaw and then to the Tuscola Area Airport in Caro airport, before making an emergency landing at Flint&#x27;s Bishop International Airport.
*On September 21, 2023, a single-engine propeller aircraft was having issues with its landing gear. Upon landing on the runway, the landing gear collapsed. There were three passengers on board the plane, but no injuries were reported and the aircraft was announced to be stable.
*On April 20, 2024, a Cirrus SR22T single-engine propeller aircraft was in route from Bellaire to Pontiac when the pilot reported that they were experiencing mechanical issues. The flight diverted to MBS International Airport, where emergency crews responded and reported that the aircraft had landed safe.

== Transportation ==
Rental car services are provided by Hertz Rent A Car, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Avis Car Rental, National Car Rental, and Budget Rent a Car. Various taxi and limousine services are available to passengers as well.

== Expansion ==
In July 2019, the FAA announced that MBS airport would receive $4.65 million for taxiway construction. This included $1.3 million in entitlement funding and $3.3 million in discretionary funding. The project added a second connection in and out of the terminal ramp, and was projected to improve efficiency.

In July 2023, the MBS Airport Commission announced that Jacksonville-based RS&amp;H would serve as construction administrator for a major runway rehabilitation project. The Runway 14/32 project was expected to take just three months to complete, at a price point of $530,000.

<text>Sawfish is a window manager for the X Window System. It aims to manage windows in the most flexible and attractive manner possible. It is able to match a window by multiple criteria such as application, size or role, and based on this, can change the window&#x27;s position, appearance, or behavior. This allows for highly customized window handling such as web browser windows opening full-screen without borders on a secondary monitor, a default terminal emulator window displaying full-screen at the desktop level, and all dialog box windows under a certain size opening on the lower right corner of the main monitor while larger ones are centered. 

Sawfish uses a Lisp-like scripting language, rep, for all of its code and configuration, making it particularly easy to customize, or program many kinds of behavior, responding to window creation, deletion, or any other changes. There is a GUI configuration utility for users who do not wish to edit configuration files directly.

== History ==
Sawfish was first called Sawmill. The name was changed because another software program had the same name. It was the standard window manager of the GNOME desktop environment until it was replaced by Metacity in Gnome 2.2.

The development had stopped, but the community restarted it in 2007.

<doc id="262490" wikidata="Q1423952" url="?curid=262490" title="Rockapella">
<text>Rockapella is an American a cappella musical group formed in 1986 in New York City. The group&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of &quot;rock&quot; and &quot;a cappella&quot;. Rockapella sings original vocal music and a cappella versions of other songs. Over time, their sound has evolved from high-energy pop and world music style toward a sound more influenced by R&amp;B. Rockapella found their enduring success in Japan early in their career. They are most successful for their role as a house band and comedy troupe on the PBS children&#x27;s geography game show &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;.

In addition to three compilation albums in Japan, Rockapella has released 19 albums in the US and Japan. Since the band&#x27;s vocal percussionist was hired, the line &quot;All sounds provided by the voices and appendages of Rockapella&quot; has been printed on each of their CDs.

==Band history==
===Early years (1986–1990)===
The founding members of Rockapella consisted of Brown University alumni Sean Altman, Elliott Kerman, Steve Keyes, and David Stix. They had each been in an a cappella group at Brown called High Jinks, but not all at the same time. Having been in High Jinks the longest, Altman was the only connection between the other three members; when they found each other in New York City following their graduation, they decided to form Rockapella. The band began performing on New York City street corners in 1986 with a hat at their feet and a song repertoire that consisted of a mix of barbershop arrangements and a cappella renditions of classic doo wop pieces that evolved to focus less on oldies and barbershop and more on contemporary rock music. Passers-by began to drop business cards into the hat, and these street corner performances led to private party and club performances around NYC.

Stix left the group in 1987 to pursue his artistic career and was replaced by Charlie Evett. That same year, a dinner party performance for television personality Kathie Lee Gifford led to Rockapella&#x27;s 1988 appearance on the WABC-TV show The Morning Show, Regis Philbin and Gifford&#x27;s NYC morning talk show before it went national. Their performance of Altman&#x27;s signature arrangement of the calypso novelty standard &quot;Zombie Jamboree&quot; caught the eye of producer Gerard Brown. He invited Rockapella to perform on the PBS &quot;Great Performances&quot; TV special &quot;Spike Lee &amp; Company – Do It A Cappella,&quot; which would put them into the national spotlight. However, Evett left the group to continue a career in software design in 1988 before the special&#x27;s taping, and Barry Carl was hired to take his place.

===&quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot; (1991–1996)===

With a PBS special and numerous morning talk show appearances under their collective belt, Rockapella was noticed by the producers of an up-and-coming children&#x27;s geography game show &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;. Shortly before the show&#x27;s premiere, Keyes had decided to leave Rockapella to launch his legal career, but was still part of the band when they auditioned and were hired to write and perform the show&#x27;s theme song as well as appearing as the comic relief house band. Keyes was replaced by Scott Leonard, who had just returned from a career as the lead singer in a Tokyo Disneyland electronic rock band. Between Leonard joining the band and the start of their television break, Rockapella began to pick up fame, starring in a Whoopi Goldberg HBO comedy special &quot;Chez Whoopi&quot;, a Taco Bell commercial, and opened for acts such as Chuck Berry, Styx, Billy Joel, and their a cappella idols The Persuasions, who the group had met on the &quot;Do It A Cappella&quot; special. They also performed on Jay Leno&#x27;s first New Year&#x27;s Eve episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1992.

Rockapella first appeared on the half-hour game show in 1991 and later continued to appear daily for five seasons, catapulting the band&#x27;s four members into mid-level television celebrity status and making the Rockapella-performed theme song (which was penned by Altman and his childhood friend, David Yazbek) as one of the best known television themes in history. Jeff Thacher joined Rockapella as the band&#x27;s permanent vocal percussionist in 1993, although he only appeared on &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; during its fifth and final season two years later. While Rockapella was seen daily in homes across America, Leonard used his connections to the Japanese music market to acquire a recording contract with ForLife Records. The group released seven albums of original and cover material under this label in Japan during their run on &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; and for two years after that, being the first to bring contemporary a cappella music to Japan. On the final episode of &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot;, Sean Altman memorably had his blonde braids cut by show host Greg Lee. As the other members of Rockapella became aware that his braids were actually being cut, they stopped miming the title song and covered their mouths in shock.

===Post-&quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; years (1997–present)===

Following the end of &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot; in 1996, Altman left Rockapella to pursue his solo career the following year, and was replaced by Kevin Wright. They did two Folger&#x27;s coffee commercials between 1998 and 2001 and a PBS special of their December 9, 2000, concert. In 2002, Carl was replaced by George Baldi III. In 2003, the group started their now annual &quot;A Rockapella Holiday&quot; tour, and in 2004, they released a live album, as well as re-released all of their previous North American albums on the independent label Shakariki Records. That same year, Kerman, the group&#x27;s baritone and the last remaining founding member of the group, left and was replaced by John K. Brown, a second tenor. Rockapella began joining the Boston Pops on stage in the eastern US in 2006, creating a concert experience that shows both the orchestra&#x27;s and Rockapella&#x27;s talents separately and together in a manner never done before: a cappella with instrumentation. In August 2009, Wright announced he would be leaving the group at the end of the year to spend more time with his family; his last performance with the band was on December 22 of that same year, and was replaced by Steven Dorian.

The project to make &quot;Bang&quot;, the title track off their newest album, the first track in Rock Band to feature full, four-instrument gameplay based on no live or synthesized instruments began in the summer of 2010, and was released for purchase on January 30, 2011 through the RBN. At the beginning of 2011, the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;It&#x27;s A Small World&quot; from their album &quot;Comfort &amp; Joy&quot;, was featured in a TV commercial for the animated film &quot;Gnomeo and Juliet&quot;. On November 16, 2011, Rockapella released a new holiday album, &quot;A Rockapella Holiday&quot;.

In 2022, Jose Rosario left the group and was replaced by Manny Houston. Bryant Vance left the group at that time as well, allowing George Baldi III to return. By mid-2023, Baldi left the group once again and was replaced by Armand Hutton.

<text>The Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. In women&#x27;s gymnastics, it competes alongside Division I and II members, as the NCAA sponsors a single championship event open to members of all NCAA divisions. As the name implies, member teams are located in the state of Wisconsin, although there are three associate members from Minnesota and one from Illinois. All full members are part of the University of Wisconsin System.

==History==
In 1913, representatives from Wisconsin&#x27;s eight normal schools—Superior Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Superior), River Falls State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin-River Falls), Stevens Point Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point), La Crosse State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–La Crosse), Oshkosh State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh), Whitewater Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater), Milwaukee State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee) and Platteville Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Platteville)—met in Madison to organize the Inter-Normal Athletic Conference of Wisconsin. The Stout Institute (now the University of Wisconsin–Stout) joined in 1914, followed by Eau Claire State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire) in 1917.

The conference evolved with the growing educational mission of its member schools. It changed its name to the Wisconsin State Teachers College Conference in 1926, and the Wisconsin State College Conference in 1951. Finally, in 1964, it became the Wisconsin State University Conference.

In 1971, the member schools of the WSUC joined with the University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Wisconsin–Parkside and Carthage College to form the Wisconsin Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. By 1975, UW–Milwaukee, Carroll College, the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay and Marquette University had also joined. With the dissolution of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women in 1982, the member schools joined their male counterparts in either the NCAA or NAIA. By 1993, the non-NCAA Division III members had all dropped out, resulting in the WWIAC having the same membership as the WSUC. Under the circumstances, a merger was inevitable. In 1996, Gary Karner was named commissioner of &quot;both&quot; the WSUC and the WWIAC. The two conferences formally merged in 1997 to form the current WIAC.

Effective with the 2001–02 academic year, Lawrence University joined the conference in the sport of wrestling. Three Minnesota schools, Gustavus Adolphus College, Hamline University and Winona State University, became members of the conference in the sport of women&#x27;s gymnastics during the 2004–05 academic year. In 2009–10, the conference added men’s soccer as a sponsored sport with the announcement of Michigan school Finlandia University as an affiliate member. Lawrence discontinued its affiliation with the WIAC in wrestling.

The conference remained unusually stable over the years; the only changes in full membership being the departures of UW–Milwaukee in 1964 and UW–Superior in 2015.

===Centennial celebration===
The ninth-oldest conference in the nation, the WIAC celebrated its centennial year during the 2012–13 academic year. Additionally, the WIAC is the most successful NCAA Division III conference in history, boasting NCAA National Championships in 15 different sports. At the beginning of the 2011–12 academic year, the conference had claimed a nation-leading 92 NCAA National Championships.

To celebrate its centennial, the conference named All-Time Teams in each sport that is currently or was previously recognized as a &quot;championship&quot; sport within the conference. Furthermore, the WIAC commissioned a commemorative work of art, created by Tim Cortes, and has also created a two-year calendar in celebration of its centennial.

The celebration was headlined by its Centennial Banquet held on August 4, 2012, at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison, Wisconsin. Among the honorees at the event were the All-Time Team members and the inaugural class to the WIAC Hall of Fame.

<text>Westville is a town in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is located immediately west of Stellarton and about four kilometres southwest of New Glasgow, the major town in the area.

==History==
Originally called Acadian Village, the name Westville was chosen because the community was west of the Albion Mines (now Stellarton).

Westville has a long history of coal mining dating back to 1864 when coal was first discovered. The opening of the Acadia Mine followed in 1866. Westville, along with Stellarton, was once home to a thriving coal mining industry. At its peak, during World War I, Westville boasted three underground workings; the Black Diamond, the Acadia, and the Drummond. Westville was the site of the Drummond Mine explosion on May 13, 1873.

The last underground mine, the Drummond pit, closed in the 1970s. Extensive open-pit mining on the Drummond and Acadia sites was carried out throughout the 1980s and 1990s, by Pioneer Coal Limited of Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

In the early 1900s Westville also boasted the largest natural ice skating rink east of Montreal.
Today the miner&#x27;s monument at Acadia Park honoring those touched by the town&#x27;s mining disasters, and a community centre is all that remains of its proud coal mining heritage. The war memorial was sculpted by the renowned Emanuel Hahn.

Like many coal towns Westville was a hotbed of sports. Baseball was very popular among the miners. One of the Westville baseball teams was crowned Maritime champion in 1927 and the legendary Babe Ruth visited the town in 1936 and hit a ball over the centre field fence. The town also sponsored championship cricket, lacrosse, football and hockey teams.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Westville had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Amenities ==

While mainly a bedroom community, Westville&#x27;s Main Street features banks, shops, restaurants and other amenities. A Nova Scotia highway rest stop was opened at the end of Cowan Street off exit 21 of Highway 104, part of the Trans-Canada Highway.

One of the largest Canada Day celebrations in Atlantic Canada takes place in Westville. The five-day event includes a county fair, street parade, and annual guest bands from around the world. The year 2007 marked the 100th anniversary of Westville&#x27;s Canada Day celebrations.

<text>The Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) was a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). As the name implies, member teams were located in the states of North Dakota and South Dakota. The conference folded after the 2011–12 academic year.

==History==
The Dakota Athletic Conference was formed from a merger between the North Dakota College Athletic Conference (NDCAC) and the South Dakota Intercollegiate Conference (SDIC), effective the 2000-01 academic year. Ten schools were a part of the conference in its history, consisting of the following:

* Formerly from the NDCAC: Dickinson State University, Jamestown College, the University of Mary, Mayville State University, Minot State University and Valley City State University
* Formerly from the SDIC: Black Hills State University, Dakota State University, Si Tanka University-Huron and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology

The DAC was one of the only NAIA conferences to have a television contract; America One owned the broadcast rights to the conference, although most of the games were only carried through the network&#x27;s subscription service, B2 Networks.

===Chronological timeline===
* 2000 – The Dakota Athletic Conference (DAC) was founded due to a merger of the North Dakota College Athletic Conference (NDCAC) and the South Dakota Intercollegiate Conference (SDIC). Charter members included Dickinson State University, Jamestown College, the University of Mary, Mayville State University, Minot State University and Valley City State University from the NDCAC, and Black Hills State University, Dakota State University, Si Tanka University–Huron and South Dakota School of Mines and Technology from the SDIC, beginning the 2000–01 academic year.
* 2005 – Si Tanka–Huron left the DAC after the school was declared to cease operations after the 2004–05 academic year.
* 2006 – Mary left the DAC to join the Division II ranks of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) after the 2005–06 academic year.
* 2011 – On July 1, 2011 Dakota State announced they were leaving the DAC to become an NAIA Independent. Additionally, member schools Black Hills State, Minot State and South Dakota Mines also left the DAC while in the process of transitioning to NCAA Division II as NCAA D-II Independents: (Black Hills State would later join the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC) and Minot State would later join the NSIC during the 2012–13 academic year, while South Dakota Mines would later the RMAC during the 2014–15 academic year), all effective after the 2010–11 academic year.
* 2012 – The DAC would cease operations as an athletic conference at the end of the 2011–12 academic year; as many schools left to join their respective new home primary conferences: Dickinson State left for the Frontier Conference while Jamestown, Mayville State and Valley City State became NAIA independent schools (though they would eventually join the North Star Athletic Association (NSAA); Jamestown, Mayville State and Valley City State as part of the charter members during the 2013–14 school year, alongside former DAC conference member and NAIA Independent Dakota State; and Dickinson State followed suit during the 2014–15 school year coming from the Frontier).

<text>The Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Member institutions are located in Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The conference was founded in 1969 as the Nebraska Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (NIAC), later becoming the Nebraska–Iowa Athletic Conference (1992) before being renamed the Great Plains Athletic Conference (2000).

==History==
The Great Plains Athletic Conference was founded on September 22, 1969, as the Nebraska Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (NIAC). The first president of the conference was Art Nicolia (NWU) while Glen Hinkle (Doane) was the vice president and Roger Olsen (Dana) was the secretary/treasure. Jack Anderson (NWU) was named the first publicist on February 28, 1970. The six charter members were Concordia University, Dana College, Doane University, Hastings College, Midland University, and Nebraska Wesleyan University. With the addition of Northwestern College in 1992, the NIAC was renamed the Nebraska–Iowa Athletic Conference. The NIAC became the Great Plains Athletic Conference in 2000 with the addition of Dakota Wesleyan University, Dordt University, Mount Marty University, and the University of Sioux Falls. Later, Briar Cliff University and Morningside University joined the GPAC in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The College of Saint Mary, a women&#x27;s only institution, joined in 2015. In 2018, University of Jamestown joined the conference as a full-member, while Presentation College joined the conference as an associate member. All former members of the NIAC remain affiliated with the GPAC except for Dana College, which closed in 2010, the University of Sioux Falls, which left the conference in 2011, and Nebraska Wesleyan University, which left the conference in 2016. Paul Clark was the commissioner of the GPAC when it formed in 2000. Corey Westra in Sioux City, Iowa, is the current commissioner of the league.

On January 17, 2023, Presentation will end its affiliate status with the GPAC as it announced that it will close, effective that spring.

On September 18, 2023, the GPAC had extended an invitation to Waldorf University as their newest full member of the conference, effective beginning the 2024–25 academic year; although at that moment, the university was already an affiliate member in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer.

<doc id="262510" wikidata="Q2056641" url="?curid=262510" title="WKRP in Cincinnati">
<text>WKRP in Cincinnati is an American sitcom television series about the misadventures of the staff of a struggling fictional AM radio station in Cincinnati, Ohio. The show was created by Hugh Wilson and was based upon his experiences working in advertising sales at Top 40 radio station WQXI in Atlanta, including many of the characters. Wilson once told &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; that he selected WKRP as the call sign to stand for C-R-A-P.

The ensemble cast consists of Gary Sandy (as Andy Travis), Howard Hesseman (Dr. Johnny Fever), Gordon Jump (Arthur Carlson), Loni Anderson (Jennifer Marlowe), Tim Reid (Venus Flytrap), Jan Smithers (Bailey Quarters), Richard Sanders (Les Nessman) and Frank Bonner (Herb Tarlek).

The series won a Humanitas Prize and received 10 Emmy Award nominations, including three for Outstanding Comedy Series. Andy Ackerman won an Emmy Award for Videotape Editing in Season 3.

&quot;WKRP&quot; premiered on September 18, 1978, on the CBS television network and aired for four seasons and 90 episodes, ending on April 21, 1982. Starting in the middle of the second season, CBS repeatedly moved the show around its schedule, contributing to lower ratings and its eventual cancellation. When &quot;WKRP&quot; went into syndication, it became an unexpected success. For the next decade, it was one of the most popular sitcoms in syndication, outperforming many programs that had been more successful in prime time, including all the other MTM Enterprises sitcoms.

Jump, Sanders, and Bonner reprised their roles as regular characters in a sequel series, &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, which ran from 1991 to 1993 in syndication. Hesseman, Reid, and Anderson also reprised their roles as guest stars.

== Premise ==
The station&#x27;s new program director, Andy Travis, tries to turn around struggling radio station WKRP by switching its format from dated easy-listening music to rock and roll, despite the mostly incompetent efforts of the well-meaning staff: bumbling station manager Arthur Carlson, greasy sales manager Herb Tarlek and clueless news director Les Nessman. To help bolster ratings, Travis hires a new disc jockey, New Orleans native Gordon Sims (with the on-air persona of Venus Flytrap) and allows spaced-out former major-market DJ John Caravella (with the on-air persona of Dr. Johnny Fever), already doing mornings in the easy-listening format, to be himself on-air. Rounding out the cast are &quot;bombshell&quot; receptionist Jennifer Marlowe and junior employee Bailey Quarters. Ruthless business tycoon Lillian Carlson appears periodically as the station&#x27;s owner and the mother of Arthur Carlson.

== Characters ==
=== Main ensemble ===
* Andy Travis (Gary Sandy). For the most part, vice president and program director Andy Travis serves as the straight man for the eccentric staff of the station he has been hired to run. Before coming to WKRP, he had an unblemished record of turning around failing radio stations, but meets his match in his wacky staff members, of whom he becomes reluctantly fond. The show&#x27;s opening theme song is about Andy and his decision to settle down in Cincinnati. In the Season 4 episode &quot;The Creation of Venus,&quot; Andy echoes the opening-theme lyrics in talking about his past (&quot;Got kinda tired of packing and unpacking, town to town, up and down the dial&quot;). 
* Arthur Carlson (Gordon Jump), occasionally called &quot;Big Guy&quot;, is the middle-aged general manager, whose main qualification for the job is that his mother, a business tycoon, is the station&#x27;s owner. Mama Carlson adopted strict methods in raising him in the mistaken belief that it would make him strong. Instead, it made him weak, and his bumbling, indecisive management style is one of the main reasons the station is unprofitable. Despite this, he is a principled, kind, decent and sometimes surprisingly wise man. He has far more interest in his hobbies (fishing, playing with various toys) than he does in the radio station, often hiding in his office from people who want to see him on business.
* Dr. Johnny Fever (Howard Hesseman) (real name John R. Caravella) is a veteran disc jockey who comes to WKRP after being fired from a major Los Angeles station when he said &quot;booger&quot; on the air. In the Season 4 episode &quot;Three Days of the Condo&quot;, always-broke Johnny surprisingly receives a $24,000 out-of-court settlement from that station for wrongful dismissal. Cynical and neurotic, and an occasional insomniac who consumes large amounts of coffee, Johnny is usually in trouble. He adopts the &quot;Fever&quot; on-air name as a quick improvisation in the pilot episode upon being told by Travis to abruptly change the format of his morning show, but he has used other monikers on the air at other stations, mostly to conform to whatever station format he found himself working with.
* Les Nessman (Richard Sanders), the fastidious, bow-tied news reporter, who is a &quot;mama&#x27;s boy&quot; of a man, approaches his job with absurdly earnest seriousness, despite being almost totally incompetent (a fact to which he is oblivious). He and salesman Herb Tarlek refer to themselves and Mr. Carlson as &quot;the suits&quot;, compared to &quot;the dungarees&quot; (Andy, Johnny, Bailey and Venus). As a running gag, Les wears a bandage in a different spot each episode, presumably due to attacks from his unseen monstrous dog Phil; the gag was inspired by Sanders bumping his head on a studio light and needing a bandage while making the pilot. Other gags are his fixation on agricultural news (&quot;the hog report&quot;), and putting masking tape on the floor around his desk, which he insists his co-workers treat as the walls of his &quot;office&quot;. He is staunchly patriotic and politically conservative, with the discovery that his biological father was a card-carrying Communist making him deeply conflicted. Venus Flytrap ribs him with wordplay by describing WKRP on the air as having &quot;more music and Les Nessman.&quot;
* Jennifer Marlowe (Loni Anderson) is the station&#x27;s receptionist and highest-paid employee. Contrary to a common assumption that she is merely &quot;eye candy&quot; for the station, Jennifer is informed, wise, connected, and able to handle practically any situation, no matter how absurd, with aplomb. She herself sees her main job responsibility as deflecting any business calls (in person or over the telephone) for Mr. Carlson. Although very aware of her sex appeal, with various wealthy, powerful older men at her beck and call, she is friendly and good-hearted with the station staff. She is very strict about the limits of her job duties: she does not type letters (though she is in fact an expert typist), and neither makes coffee nor brings any to the office staff.
* Herb Tarlek (Frank Bonner) is the boorish, tasteless, and vain sales manager at WKRP, who is sometimes referred to as &quot;Little Guy&quot; to Mr. Carlson&#x27;s &quot;Big Guy&quot;. He often wears loud plaid suits, with his belt matching his white shoes. He is unable to land the big accounts, but is effective in selling air time for products such as &quot;Red Wigglers – the Cadillac of worms!&quot; Although a married man with children, he persistently pursues Jennifer, who has absolutely no interest in him. While Herb is portrayed as buffoonish most of the time, he occasionally shows a sympathetic side. One of Herb&#x27;s catch phrases is &quot;no problemo&quot;; another is &quot;okay fine&quot;. Herb is based on radio executive Clarke Brown. Bert Parks appears in one episode as Tarlek&#x27;s father, Herb Sr. The elder Tarlek is very much like his son.
* Venus Flytrap (Tim Reid), the soulful, funky evening DJ, runs his show with a smooth-talking persona and mood lighting in the studio. His real name, Gordon Sims, is almost never used, and he maintains an aura of mystery. In an early episode, it is revealed that he is a Vietnam War deserter wanted by the US Army. In later episodes, his backstory is elaborated upon and it is revealed that after deserting, he spent several years as a high school teacher in New Orleans while working part-time as a radio personality. In spite of the fact that he is a nighttime DJ and Johnny Fever works the early morning shift, the two are often seen together and become good friends as the series progresses, with Venus taking the job in the first place in part due to his admiration for Johnny as a DJ.
* Bailey Quarters (Jan Smithers), the young ingénue of the radio station, is originally in charge of billing and station traffic. However, having graduated from journalism school with some training in editing, and intent on becoming a broadcast executive, she is later given additional duties as an on-air news reporter, in which she proves more capable than Les Nessman. As the series progresses, she overcomes her shyness and develops self-confidence. Beginning with the second season two-part episode &quot;For Love or Money&quot;, she occasionally becomes linked romantically with Johnny Fever. The dynamic between Jennifer and Bailey has been likened to that between Ginger and Mary Ann on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Jan Smithers was one of two &quot;WKRP&quot; cast members who was the first choice for the role she played, Gordon Jump being the other. Creator Hugh Wilson said that despite Smithers&#x27; lack of experience (she had never acted in a situation comedy before), she was perfect for the character of Bailey as he had conceived her: &quot;Other actresses read better for the part,&quot; Wilson recalled, &quot;but they were &quot;playing&quot; shy. Jan &quot;was&quot; shy.&quot;

===Other characters===
* Lillian Carlson (Sylvia Sidney in the series pilot, Carol Bruce afterward) is Arthur Carlson&#x27;s ruthless, domineering mother – often referred to as Mother Carlson (with Arthur calling her Mama) – and the owner of WKRP. An extremely successful and rich businesswoman, her only regret is that her approach to parenting (the &quot;what doesn&#x27;t kill you, makes you stronger&quot; school of child-rearing) backfired as her son ended up indecisive, weak-willed, and afraid of her. As a display of her cutthroat attitude, she has a painting hanging above her fireplace in her living room of two pairs of dangling legs of people just hanged. In the series&#x27; final episode, it is revealed she had always intended WKRP to lose money (for the tax write-off), which explains why she allows the incompetent employees to continue working at the station. The only one who is regularly able to get the better of her is her sarcastic butler, Hirsch.
* Carmen Carlson (Allyn Ann McLerie) is Mr. Carlson&#x27;s sweet-natured wife. The two met in college, he being her chosen date to a &quot;bring a loser&quot; dance at the sorority she was pledging, something he was unaware of until their twenty-five-year college reunion as they never did go to the dance and she never did pledge that sorority. Though happily married, they are so anxious to avoid hurting each other&#x27;s feelings that they rarely tell each other what they really think. They have a son, Arthur Carlson Jr. (Sparky Marcus appearing in one episode), whom they&#x27;ve sent off to military school. During the second season Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and during the third season gives birth to a daughter, Melanie.
* Hirsch (Ian Wolfe) is Mother Carlson&#x27;s &quot;houseboy.&quot; He is well into his eighties, but is energetic and seems unfazed by any new circumstances. Hirsch regularly expresses his dislike for his employer in otherwise charming and polite exchanges. His coffee is terrible, unless there is a guest, in which case he prepares it with care.
* Lucille Tarlek (Edie McClurg) is Herb&#x27;s devoted nasal-voiced wife, who, deep down, knows that he chases after Jennifer. Lucille is perhaps the one woman who does see Herb&#x27;s charms. Herb and Lucille have an adolescent son and daughter, Herb III and Bunny (N.P. Schoch and Stacy Heather Tolkin, one and two appearances respectively).
* Three other DJs at the station are mentioned, but (with one exception) never seen. Moss Steiger has the graveyard shift after Venus and is mentioned as having attempted suicide at least twice; he eventually dies in &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. Rex Erhardt (who was seen in the fourth-season episode &quot;Rumors&quot;, and played by Sam Anderson) hosts a program after Dr. Johnny Fever&#x27;s morning show; and Dean the Dream has the afternoon drive slot. Another DJ, Doug Winter (Philip Charles MacKenzie), is hired and fired in the same episode (&quot;Johnny Comes Back&quot;).
* Frank Bartman (Max Wright) is a cynical but practical attorney retained by the station in the fourth season.
* Series writer Bill Dial infrequently appears as Buckey Dornster, WKRP&#x27;s station engineer.
* Longtime actor William Woodson (though not credited) served as the announcer of the series (imploring the audience to stay tuned for the tag scene, in the episodes that had one) and did various voice-over roles during the run, including the pre-recorded announcer of the intro/outro to Les&#x27;s newscasts, and the narrator of the trial results in the first-season episode &quot;Hold Up&quot;.

Throughout its run &quot;WKRP&quot; featured appearances by several high-profile guest stars, including Colleen Camp, Sparky Anderson, Hoyt Axton and Michael Des Barres. Hamilton Camp, Craig T. Nelson, and Robert Ridgely also appeared in supporting roles.

== Episodes ==

== Timeslots and success ==
&quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; debuted in 1978 in CBS&#x27;s Monday 8 p.m. timeslot, competing against ABC&#x27;s &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; and NBC&#x27;s top-20 show &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot; The show initially earned poor ratings, and &quot;WKRP&quot; was put on hiatus after only eight episodes, even though they included some of the most famous of the series, including &quot;Turkeys Away.&quot; But owing to good reviews and positive fan reaction, especially from disc jockeys, who immediately hailed it as the first show that realistically portrayed the radio business, CBS brought &quot;WKRP&quot; back without any cast changes.

&quot;WKRP&quot; was given a new timeslot, one of the best on the network, following &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. This allowed creator Hugh Wilson to move away from the farcical radio-based stories that CBS wanted and to start telling stories that, while not necessarily dramatic, were more low-key and character-based. To allow the ensemble cast to mingle more, the set was expanded. A previously unseen communal office area (&quot;the bullpen&quot;) was added to accommodate scenes with the entire cast.

Partway through the second season, the show was moved back to its original earlier time. CBS executives wanted to free up the prized post-&quot;M*A*S*H&quot; slot for &quot;House Calls&quot; (with former &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; star Wayne Rogers). They also felt that the rock and roll music and the sex appeal of Loni Anderson were better suited to the earlier slot, which was mostly aimed at young people. The mid-season timeslot change did not affect the show&#x27;s success; &quot;WKRP&quot; finished at No. 22 in the ratings for its second year. For the next two seasons, the writers and producers often fought with CBS over the show&#x27;s content in the so-called family hour.

Starting with the second season, CBS moved &quot;WKRP&quot; around repeatedly, and the show lost nearly 2.5 million viewers on average for each of four timeslot changes in the 1979–80 season.

At the end of the fourth season, the network canceled &quot;WKRP&quot;. The final first-run episode of &quot;WKRP&quot; aired on April 21, 1982, and ranked No. 7 in the weekly Nielsen ratings, though the series had already been canceled.

== Production ==
&quot;WKRP&quot; was videotaped in Hollywood before a live studio audience at KTLA&#x27;s Goldenwest Videotape Division, later moving to the CBS Studio Center lot in Studio City.

== Awards and nominations ==
== Fact vs. fiction ==
=== &quot;Real&quot; WKRP people ===
While Andy Travis received his name and some personality elements from a cousin of creator Hugh Wilson, he was based primarily on innovative program director Mikel Herrington, who also was the inspiration for the character Jeff Dugan in the 1978 film &quot;FM&quot;, written by Ezra Sacks, who had worked at KMET. Dr. Johnny Fever was based on a DJ named &quot;Skinny&quot; Bobby Harper at WQXI/790 in Atlanta, Georgia in 1968. WKRP writer Bill Dial worked with Harper at WQXI, which is considered Dial&#x27;s inspiration for the show. Coincidentally, Harper had previously worked at Cincinnati AM Top 40 powerhouse WSAI in 1964, before moving to 11 other stations, including seven in Atlanta. In 1997, Bobby Harper told WSB&#x27;s Condace Pressley, &quot;He went on record as pointing out which ones, including myself, that he based the characters on. [That recognition] was a nice little thing. You know? That was nice. I appreciated that.&quot; The Carlsons were a pastiche of Jerry Blum, WQXI&#x27;s longtime general manager. Mrs. Carlson inherited Blum&#x27;s brashness while Arthur borrowed his nickname &quot;Big Guy,&quot; sense of style, and some of his unorthodox promotions (including the turkey drop).

=== Transmission tower ===
Although the show aired on CBS, the self-supporting transmission tower seen at the beginning of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; actually belongs to Cincinnati&#x27;s NBC affiliate, WLWT.

=== Studios and offices ===
In the show, WKRP&#x27;s offices and studios are in the Osgood R. Flimm Building, an art deco office building. The building shown during the show&#x27;s opening credits is actually the Cincinnati Enquirer Building at 617 Vine Street in downtown Cincinnati.

===Real stations with similar branding===
Cincinnati has two radio stations with call letters similar to &quot;WKRP&quot;. WKRC, an AM station that had a &quot;middle of the road&quot; music format when the series debuted, did not object to the use of &quot;WKRP&quot;, saying that it was the best publicity that they had ever had, and it was free; it currently brands itself (as it did during the show&#x27;s run) as &quot;55KRC&quot;. WKRQ is an FM station with a similar &quot;contemporary hit radio&quot; format; its primary branding is &quot;Q102.&quot;

Other stations have adopted similar branding in reference to the series. In 1986, a Salt Lake City FM station (now KUMT) changed its calls letters to KRPN, and branded itself as &quot;WKRP&quot;, using the similarity of the spoken letter &quot;&quot;N&quot; to the word &quot;in&quot;&quot; for a sound-alike station identification: &quot;W KRPN Salt Lake City&quot;. In 2008, Cincinnati television station WBQC-LD promoted its conversion to digital broadcasting by rebranding itself &quot;WKRP-TV&quot;. In 2015, a low-power FM station in Raleigh, North Carolina began broadcasting as WKRP-LP.

==Music==
===Musical themes===
WKRP had two musical themes, one opening and the other closing the show.

The opening theme, a soft rock/pop number called &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati Main Theme,&quot; was composed by Tom Wells, with lyrics by series creator Hugh Wilson, and was performed by Steve Carlisle. An urban legend circulated at the time that Richard Sanders (who had comparable vocal characteristics to those of Carlisle) had recorded the song. Wilson stated in the commentary for the first season&#x27;s DVD set that this was not true. Sanders would later &quot;sing&quot; the lyrics in a promo spot on VH1 for &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; that parodied the U2 song &quot;Numb.&quot;

The closing theme was a different song with more of a hard rock sound performed by Atlanta musician Jim Ellis, played over scenes from the episodes followed by a still photo of the Cincinnati skyline. Ellis recorded the song as a demonstration for Wilson, and as he had not yet written lyrics for it, Ellis mumbled nonsense words. Wilson chose to use the demo version because he found the gibberish lyrics funny and a satire on the unintelligible lyrics of many rock songs.

A longer version of the original theme song was released in 1979 on a 45-rpm vinyl single on the MCA Records label. It peaked at 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1981 and at 29 on the Adult Contemporary chart in 1982.

===Music licensing===
The show&#x27;s use of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; was widely credited with helping the song become a major U.S. hit, and the band&#x27;s record label Chrysalis Records presented the producers with a gold record award for the song&#x27;s album &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;. The gold record can be seen hanging on the wall in the &quot;bullpen&quot; set in many episodes.

The songs were often tied into episode plots, and some pieces of music were even used as running gags. For example, the doorbell at Jennifer&#x27;s penthouse apartment played &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; (which was later replaced by &quot;Beautiful Dreamer&quot; for copyright reasons).

Wilson has commented that &quot;WKRP&quot; was videotaped rather than filmed because at the time, music-licensing fees were lower for videotaped programs, a loophole that was intended to accommodate variety shows. Music licensing deals that were cut at the time of production covered only a limited number of years, but when the show entered syndication shortly after its 1982 cancellation, most of the original music remained intact because the licensing deals were still active. After the licenses had expired, later syndicated versions of the show did not feature the music as first broadcast, with stock production music inserted in place of the original songs to avoid paying additional royalties. In some cases (such as during scenes with dialogue over background music), some of the characters&#x27; lines were dubbed by soundalike actors, a practice evident in all prints of the show issued since the early 1990s, including those used for its late-1990s run on Nick at Nite.

The expense of procuring licenses for the original music delayed release of a DVD set for years. When a Season 1 set was finally released, much of the music was again replaced and the soundalike vocal dubs were present. Some scenes were shortened or cut entirely, but some deleted scenes that had not been included in the original broadcast were added.

==Home media==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;WKRP&quot; on DVD in region 1 in 2007, with a number of music replacements. Sales of the set were poor, and Fox released no further seasons.

In 2014, Shout! Factory acquired rights to the series for DVD release. Shout! had planned to include all of the copyrighted music that originally aired on the show, and obtained the rights to include what they called &quot;the vast majority of the music&quot;, but explained, &quot;In a few cases, it was simply impossible to get the rights.&quot; Most of the dialogue dubs done for the 1990s syndication airings were removed, and the original dialogue restored. This release presented the second-season episode &quot;Filthy Pictures&quot; and the third-season episode &quot;Dr. Fever and Mr. Tide&quot; in their original hour-long formats instead of the syndicated two-part versions, bringing the episode count from 90 episodes to 88 episodes.

<text>The Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC or The Heart) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Member institutions are located in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska in the United States.

==History==
The HAAC&#x27;s earliest ancestor was the Missouri College Athletic Union (MCAU), which was formed in 1924 when the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association (now the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association or MIAA) split in two. The old MIAA&#x27;s private schools formed the Athletic Union, while the state teachers&#x27; colleges stayed in the MIAA. It was reorganized as the HAAC in 1971 when it began admitting schools outside Missouri. However, the HAAC does not presently claim the Athletic Union&#x27;s history as its own.

In early 2014, Grand View University and William Penn University were announced as members for the 2015–16 school year. In April 2015, Clarke University and Mount Mercy University were also announced as members for the 2016–17 school year. In October 2019, Park University was approved for HAAC membership and joined in the 2020–21 school year. On February 10, 2022, long-serving Evangel University accepted its invitation to join the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference, also Kansas-based, in 20234.

On July 24, 2023, William Woods University (alongside St. Ambrose) announced they would join the conference as associate members in football beginning in the 2024 fall season (2024–25 school year). The expansion made it NAIA&#x27;s largest football conference with 14 teams playing in two divisions.

The current commissioner of the conference is Lori Thomas. Thomas, the first female commissioner in NAIA history, began her term in 2014, succeeding Larry Lady who retired after 22 years as commissioner.

<text>Simon Robert Fuller (born 17 May 1960) is a British entrepreneur, artist manager, and film and television producer. He is the creator of the &quot;Idols&quot; TV format, including the British series &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and the American series &quot;American Idol&quot;.

Fuller came to prominence in the 1990s for managing the British girl group the Spice Girls, and he has since managed acts in various fields of entertainment, from sports stars David Beckham and Lewis Hamilton to other musicians such as Amy Winehouse and Annie Lennox.

Since 2020, Fuller has been working with tech firm TikTok to aid development of new TikTok creatives and in the same year he announced a partnership with Verizon Communications to develop 5G content. In 2021, Pearson PLC announced a partnership with Fuller to create a new global education business in Performing Arts. In 2016, Fuller persuaded Swedish quartet ABBA to reunite to explore working in virtual reality, which led to the ABBA Voyage project.

&quot;Time&quot; has named Fuller one of the 100 most influential people in the world. He has been certified as the most successful British music manager of all time by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Fuller received the 2,441st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on 23 May 2011. In 2014 he was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Brighton in his home county East Sussex in recognition for his &quot;contribution to business, entrepreneurship and philanthropy&quot;. The 2020 &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; estimated Fuller&#x27;s wealth at £445 million.

== Biography ==
Fuller was born on 17 May 1960 in British Cyprus, though later the family moved to Accra, Ghana where his father was the headmaster of the British Military School, Burma Camp. The family moved back to Hastings, East Sussex, where Simon&#x27;s father became headmaster of the school he attended. He has two brothers, Kim and Mark.

Fuller began his career in 1981 at Chrysalis Music Limited in the UK, where he signed Madonna&#x27;s first hit &#x27;Holiday&#x27; to the company. He started his own management company in 1985, 19 Entertainment, eventually selling the business to CKX, Inc. in a cash and stock deal worth over $200 million in March 2005. In 2008 the company delivered a profit of $92.5 million (£66m) into the parent company. Fuller became a director of CKX, a position which gave him creative control over all of CKX&#x27;s assets including the Elvis Presley Estate, Muhammad Ali&#x27;s business interests, and other rights properties, until January 2010 when he started a new firm, XIX Entertainment, while continuing to work with CKX/19 as a consultant and executive producer. XIX Entertainment was given a valuation of $100 million and is run from offices in London and Los Angeles.

In February 2008, Fuller was presented with the PGA Award by the Producers Guild of America in Hollywood. At the event he was praised for his creativity, entrepreneurship, and charity work by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and current King Charles III, who was still the Prince of Wales at the time, who also thanked Fuller for his support of the Prince&#x27;s charity The Prince&#x27;s Trust.

=== TV production, formats, technology ===
Fuller&#x27;s first broadcast venture was &quot;Miami &quot;7&quot;&quot;, a scripted TV drama starring the British pop group S Club 7 screened by BBC/Fox Kids in 100+ territories around the world. &quot;Miami 7&quot; launched the careers of several stars including Rachel Stevens, Jon Lee, Holly Willoughby, and Ben Barnes, and the show created a blueprint for the teen-oriented television musicals that followed, including &quot;Glee&quot; and &quot;High School Musical&quot;.

In 2001, Fuller created &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, a prime time TV show on British television that Maggie Brown in &quot;The Guardian&quot; states &quot;became a seminal reality/entertainment format&quot;. The show produced instant No 1 chart hits, including for Will Young, whose single &quot;Evergreen&quot; was named by &quot;NME&quot; magazine in 2012 as the &quot;biggest selling single of the century&quot; in the UK. Fuller sold &quot;Pop Idol&quot; around the world, and he has been credited with creating the world&#x27;s most valuable TV format with a value of over $8 billion made up of revenue from sponsors, merchandising, telephone, music sales, broadcast and advertising sources. In the US, &quot;American Idol&quot; became a No.1 rated show. The show made stars of its presenter Ryan Seacrest as well as Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul as well as many of its performers including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and others. Over 30 million viewers saw David Cook win the seventh season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in May 2008 and when Fuller re-launched the show in 2011 for its 10th season ratings climbed 20% for the finale event. 122.4 million votes were cast, a record for a reality TV show. 

In 2004, Fuller created teen musical TV series, &quot;I Dream&quot;. This featured the S Club 7 spin-off band, S Club 8. It also featured Christopher Lloyd of Back to the Future fame. &quot;I Dream&quot; ended after thirteen episodes, and was panned by critics.

In 2005, Fuller, along with co-creator Nigel Lythgoe, launched &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot; on the Fox network in the US. The show grew over 16 seasons to become a regular summer hit. In 2012, Simon Fuller&#x27;s XIX Entertainment created a new international format with Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, and Jamie King named Q&#x27;Viva! The Chosen, and described as a celebration of Latin culture that screened in 21 territories reaching over 30 million Spanish-speaking TV viewers.

In December 2016, Norwegian state broadcaster NRK announced that it had concluded a deal with Simon Fuller to produce the English language version of &quot;Skam&quot;; Fuller later announced a deal with Facebook to launch award-winning drama format SKAM Austin in the US in 2018.

In 2017, international news media reported on auditions being staged by Fuller&#x27;s business XIX for Now United, a real time access global pop group being cast in 14 cities around the world. In 2019, the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; confirmed that BBC One would broadcast &quot;Serengeti&quot;, a wildlife drama created by Fuller. In July 2020, US media reported that &quot;Serengeti&quot;, voiced by Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, created by Simon Fuller, was nominated for a Primetime EMMY Award

In February 2023, Fuller created a fictional anthropomorphic animal band/dance troupe, The Meeps, whose debut single is &quot;Love Louder&quot;.

== Impact on music culture ==
Fuller came to prominence in the 1990s for managing the pop group the Spice Girls. He has managed acts including Victoria Beckham, Annie Lennox, S Club 7, S Club Juniors, Now United, Steven Tyler, Amy Winehouse, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson, Will Young, Emma Bunton, Any Gabrielly, The Future X, Lisa Marie Presley and many more in addition to sports icons Lewis Hamilton and Andy Murray.

In 2008, Fuller was certified as the most successful British music manager of all time by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. He has managed the career of Annie Lennox since the release of her multi-platinum album &quot;Diva&quot; in 1991. He has managed hit songwriters and producers, including Cathy Dennis, who first met Fuller as the singer of D Mob in the 1980s. Under Fuller&#x27;s guidance, Dennis became the UK&#x27;s No. 1 female songwriter with a string of hits for artists including Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, Pink, Will Young, and others.

Fuller managed the Spice Girls through the peak of their 1990s success and he remains in partnership with the five girls today. Under Fuller&#x27;s guidance, the Spice Girls became a marketing phenomenon, rose to chart topper status worldwide and went on to sell over 85 million records. In 2002, Fuller&#x27;s company discovered 19-year-old Amy Winehouse, produced her first award-winning album &quot;Frank&quot; and signed her to Universal Music.

In 2005, 2006, and 2007, the biggest selling music acts in North America (Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, and Daughtry) were all managed by Fuller. In October 2016, Fuller announced a joint venture with the 4 original members of the Swedish supergroup ABBA to create a new digital ABBA. In August 2020, BBC News announced that Fuller had signed an exclusive agreement with tech firm TikTok. In 2025 Fuller&#x27;s longterm partnership with Nick Shymansky&#x27;s Day One Music management company led to a UK No.1 ands global hit for Lola Young. 

In 2001, while managing S Club 7, Fuller wanted to put together a spin-off band of ‘mini-me’s’ to support S Club 7 on tour. This resulted in a reality-tv type show, &quot;S Club Search&quot;, and a new band called S Club Juniors (later known as S Club 8.) The members of the band were aged 10-13. Initially S Club Juniors were only meant to support S Club 7 on one of their tour dates at Wembley Arena; however the Juniors’ proved to be so popular, that they supported S Club 7 on every tour date and later toured alongside them for the &quot;S Club United&quot; tour. S Club 8 also went on to release seven singles, two albums and a TV show, &quot;I Dream&quot;.

== Fashion activity ==
Fuller owns significant stakes in several British fashion businesses including Victoria Beckham Ltd. In 2006, Fuller brokered the deal for 19 Entertainment to purchase a majority share in Storm Model Management. In 2008, after assembling a highly qualified creative team Fuller launched the Victoria Beckham dress collection at New York Fashion Week. Since then, Victoria Beckham Limited has grown to become a best-selling high-end fashion brand, stocked in over 400 outlets around the world and winning Brand of The Year at the 2012 and 2014 British Fashion Awards. In 2012, Fuller accompanied Victoria Beckham to launch the business in China.

In February 2012, XIX Entertainment launched a David Beckham bodywear range in 2,500 H&amp;M stores around the world. This was followed in 2015 when Fuller announced a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Global Brands Group Holding Ltd (787) giving Fuller and Beckham ownership of their own apparel business specifically to develop the David Beckham brand and other consumer products. The first result of this partnership was the Fall 2016 re-launch of the British heritage menswear label Kent &amp; Curwen, which under Beckham, Fuller and 7 Global ownership currently runs 113 stores in 51 cities worldwide. In 2019, US media reported that Fuller sold 33% share of David Beckham business for $50 million after generating revenue of $72.4 million and a profit of $16 million for fiscal 2017.

== Sport activity ==
In 2003, Fuller formed a joint venture partnership with British footballer David Beckham and went onto build a diverse range of business interests in sport, leisure, fashion and entertainment over a period of 16 years that became known as Brand Beckham. In 2006 Fuller took on representation of the England soccer team at Beckham&#x27;s suggestion and the following year Fuller negotiated his five year contract for Beckham to join LA Galaxy. In 2013, Fuller and Beckham discussed plans to buy an MLS football team in Miami with Beckham thanking Fuller in an interview with CNN: “When I signed my contract my manager Simon Fuller actually got a clause in the contract that enabled me to have a franchise at the end of my playing career”.

Later in the same year Fuller and Beckham launched a new global whisky in partnership with British drinks company Diageo. Fuller&#x27;s plan to deliver Beckham&#x27;s ownership of an MLS team was announced in January 2018 when Miami was confirmed as 25th MLS team. The Financial Times reported that Fuller sold his interests in David Beckham&#x27;s business in 2019 for a reported £50m. In 2025, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; published an interview in which Fuller explained how he created &quot;Brand Beckham&quot;.

In 2009, Fuller took on personal representation of British No.1 tennis player Andy Murray, representing him during his US Open and Wimbledon wins and later helping the player to establish his own business. In March 2011, Fuller was announced as the manager of British F1 driver Lewis Hamilton and surprised many when he moved Hamilton from McLaren and signed him to a long-term contract with the MercedesAMG team. Hamilton won the 2014 F1 World Championship and publicly thanked Fuller for his support.

<doc id="262525" wikidata="Q1421504" url="?curid=262525" title="Pittsburgh International Airport">
<text>Pittsburgh International Airport — originally Greater Pittsburgh Airport and later Greater Pittsburgh International Airport — is a civil-military international airport in Findlay Township and Moon Township, Pennsylvania, United States. About 10 miles (15 km) west of downtown Pittsburgh, it is the primary international airport serving the Greater Pittsburgh Region as well as adjacent areas in West Virginia and Ohio. The airport is owned and operated by the Allegheny County Airport Authority and offers passenger flights to destinations throughout North America and Europe. PIT has four runways and covers . PIT is the largest civil/public airport in terms of land area in the state of Pennsylvania.

First opened in 1952, the airport was initially served by five airlines and became a small hub for Trans World Airlines for over two decades. The airport underwent a massive $1 billion rebuilding and expansion that was largely designed to US Airways&#x27; specification so it could become one of their major hubs. Completed in 1992, the new airport was one of the most innovative in the world, dubbed the &quot;airport of the future&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, and helped to pioneer modern airport design with its X-shape to reduce distance between gates, underground tram to transport passengers around the airport, and array of shopping options, all of which were cutting-edge at the time. Traffic peaked at 20 million passengers in the late 1990s, and US Air peaked at 542 flights and 11,995 employees at the airport in 2001, and the airport was an important pillar of the Pittsburgh economy. The downturn in air travel immediately after September 11 attacks badly harmed US Airways&#x27; financial state. US Air declared chapter 11 bankruptcy twice in a row, and abandoned Pittsburgh as a hub in 2004, eliminating thousands of jobs and nearly bankrupting the airport itself, which was built largely to suit US Airways&#x27; needs. US Air&#x27;s diminished capacity at Pittsburgh opened the door for other airlines to expand operations and better serve local Pittsburgh-area passengers rather than focus on connecting passengers.

The airport experienced a resurgence in the 2010s, doubling the number of carriers to 16 as the Allegheny County Airport Authority has aggressively courted airlines and lobbied for new passenger routes. Southwest Airlines has increased its presence at the airport in recent years, overtaking American Airlines (which US Airways merged with) as the largest carrier in terms of passengers. The airport is also a hub for regional carrier Southern Airways Express. Cargo operations have increased at the airport in recent years.

Since the late 2010s, a number of developments have been made which include a $1.39 billion renovation due to open in 2025 after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2017, the same year that the renovation was announced, the airport became the first in the country to reopen access to the post-security terminal for individuals who are not flying, as long as they can pass through security, after the federal government lifted restrictions put in place after 9/11. In 2021, the airport became the first in the world with its own microgrid, which provides power to the entire airport with natural gas and solar power. The ongoing renovation will create a new terminal for check-in, security, and baggage claim adjacent to the gates, eliminating the need for the tram and increasing the number of parking spaces. Officials emphasized that the renovations would make the airport more suited to Pittsburgh, rather than to US Airways. The project will not use any local tax dollars, and airlines will pay most of the costs.

==History==
===Early years===
Until the beginning of World War II, Moon Township was mostly a rural agricultural area. It was not considered a suburb of downtown Pittsburgh as it was too distant. It was served solely by Pittsburgh-based state and federal services and media. In the early 1920s, John A. Bell of Carnegie purchased a number of small farms in Moon and established a commercial dairy farm on his of land. He was bought out by Edward E. Rieck and his wife, and C.F. Nettrour, owners of the established Rieck&#x27;s Dairy. They doubled the number of cattle at the farm.

Around 1940, the federal government, through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), determined that the Pittsburgh area needed a military airport to defend the industrial wealth of the area and to provide a training base and stop-over facility. The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was continuing to invest in infrastructure across the country in the waning years of the Great Depression, before the US entered World War II, which had started in 1939. The agricultural expanses of Moon Township were attractive to airport planners in the city. The Civil Aeronautics Administration proposed $2.6 million to the county for a $6 million field in August 1941 ($ and $ present day dollars). The county bought the Bell Farm, and federal agencies began construction of the runways on 20 April 1942, after the US had entered the war.

In 1944, Allegheny County officials proposed to expand the military airport with the addition of a commercial passenger terminal to relieve the Allegheny County Airport, which was built in 1926 and was becoming too small. Ground was broken on the new passenger terminal on 18 July 1946. The new terminal would eventually cost $33 million ($ present day dollars) and was built entirely by Pittsburgh-area companies. The new airport, christened as Greater Pittsburgh Airport (renamed Greater Pittsburgh International Airport in 1972 upon the opening of the International Arrivals Building) opened on 31 May 1952. The first flight was on 3 June 1952. In its first full year of operation in 1953, more than 1.4 million passengers used the terminal. &quot;Greater Pitt&quot; was then considered modern and spacious. The airport terminal was the largest in the United States, second only to Idlewild Airport&#x27;s (now JFK Airport) in New York when it was completed five years later. The airport&#x27;s capacity is one of its most valuable assets.
The airport was designed by local architect Joseph W. Hoover. One of the features of his style is the use of simple, exposed concrete, steel, and glass materials. The terminal building was constructed in &quot;stepped&quot; levels: the first floor extended farther than the second, the second floor extended farther than the third, etc. Such a design meant that the uncovered roof of the lower level could be an observation deck. In addition to the observation decks, the rounded &quot;Horizon Room&quot; was on the fourth floor with a commanding view of the airport. The interior of the terminal building was in the contemporary International Style, as was the exterior. One of the memorable features of the lobby was the large compass laid in the floor with green and yellow-orange terrazzo. A mobile by Alexander Calder was another decorative feature of the lobby. The mobile hangs in the center core of the new airside terminal. A re-creation of the compass was installed in the new terminal at an exhibit dedicated to old &quot;Greater Pitt&quot;.

===Growth and hub years===
The first five airlines of the Greater Pittsburgh Airport were Trans World Airlines (TWA), Capital Airlines (later part of United), Northwest, All American (later Allegheny Airlines, then USAir, and finally US Airways), and Eastern Airlines. The April 1957 Airline Guide shows 58 weekday departures on Capital, 54 TWA, 18 Allegheny, 8 United, 7 Eastern, 4 Northwest, 3 American and 2 Lake Central. The first jets in service at Pittsburgh were TWA 707s on a Los Angeles-Chicago-Pittsburgh loop in summer 1959.

The 1956 diagram shows runway 10/28 7500 ft, 5/23 5766 ft and 14/32 5965 ft. The longest runway was still 7500 ft when jets started in 1959 but was soon extended to 8000 ft. The 10500-ft runway 10L was added by 1965.

In 1959, the east dock was added to the terminal. On 1 July 1968, international airport status was obtained with the dedication of the first customs office at the complex. Ground was broken for the International Wing, west of the original terminal building, in 1970. It opened in 1972 to accommodate federal inspection services; international flights (Nordair 737s to Canada) began in 1971. The airport expanded as load increased. In 1972, rotundas were added to the end of each dock to allow more gates. In the later 1970s growth in regional air travel created a need for more gates. In 1980 the South East Dock was opened. Even with these expansions, the terminal was too small.
From the 1960s to about 1985, TWA operated a small hub at Pittsburgh. The carrier introduced service to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport on a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar in May 1981. This was the first route from Pittsburgh to Europe. It lasted four months; TWA stated that too few passengers were traveling in first class, rendering the service unprofitable. In May 1985, British Airways started a link to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport via Washington, D.C., using Boeing 747s. Two days before the maiden flight, the airline had sent one of its Concordes to Pittsburgh to celebrate the launch of the route.

In 1987, with the financial backing of USAir (then the dominant carrier in Pittsburgh), work commenced on a billion-dollar expansion. USAir inaugurated a link to Frankfurt in June 1990. The flight aboard Boeing 767s benefited the various West German companies that had offices in the city.

On 1 October 1992, the new terminal opened, with operations having been transferred overnight from the old terminal. (The old terminal was kept until 1999 to house remaining operations offices.) The new terminal had numerous innovative features, including an AirMall, with more than 100 retailers and eateries. The air mall and underground tram were considered cutting-edge. The new landside/airside design construction eliminated the need for connecting passengers to go through security more than once. The airport was equipped to handle up to 35 million passengers per year. The modern and innovative Pittsburgh airport became a model for other airports around the world. Its design simplified aircraft movement on the airfield and enabled easy pedestrian traffic to the gates.

US Air expanded with the new airport, and by 1995 they had nonstops from PIT to 91 airports, plus 28 more on USAir Express. In 1997 the airport handled almost 21 million passengers, more than any previous year. By the late 1990s growth had leveled off, with USAir concentrating on expanding at Philadelphia and Charlotte/Douglas International Airport, which had been a hub airport of Piedmont Airlines.

In August 2001, the airport had its busiest month ever with 2 million passengers and an average of 633 daily flights, and was on track for 2001 to be its busiest year ever. Then the September 11 attacks harmed the aviation industry, and US Air in particular, setting in motion the decline of Pittsburgh as a hub. US Air began slashing jobs a week after the attacks and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 2002. High operating costs at the airport put the US Airways hub in Pittsburgh at a serious disadvantage. By 2003, US Airways reported to be running a $40 million loss per year ($ present day dollars) operating its hub at Pittsburgh, while also paying roughly 80% of the new airport&#x27;s $673 million debt ($ present day dollars) stemming from its requested construction of the new terminals.

Just before emerging from bankruptcy in 2003, US Air canceled its leases at Pittsburgh without any notice to airport and county officials, a move that former Allegheny County Airport Authority executive director said was &quot;completely immoral and unethical&quot; in a 2021 interview. US Air filed for bankruptcy again in September 2004. Two months later, the carrier ceased service to London-Gatwick and Frankfurt, leaving the airport without any flights to Europe. After failed negotiations to lower landing fees and debt obligations, the airline announced in December 2004 that it would be reducing operations at Pittsburgh, shifting hub operations to Charlotte and Philadelphia. By the end of 2005 the airline had eliminated 7,000 jobs while operating roughly 200 flights per day, mostly domestic. A year later, US Airways had only about 170 flights per day to and from Pittsburgh, most being domestic flights. Unrelenting flight and job cuts continued through the decade; accompanied by the airline&#x27;s closure of Concourse E on the Landside Terminal and a portion of Concourse A on the Airside Terminal. In 2007, US Air&#x27;s market share in Pittsburgh dropped below 40% for the first time since the airport&#x27;s expansion in 1992. By the end of the decade, US Airways had reduced to 68 flights per day, operating from ten gates on Concourse B, and one US Airways Club location. Numerous US Airways ticketing and customer service counters were abandoned, and 15 gates on Concourse A and B were sealed off from the rest of the airport. Pittsburgh&#x27;s air traffic bottomed out in 2013 with 7.8 million passengers and 36 destinations.

Despite de-hubbing the airport, US Airways chose Pittsburgh in 2008 for their systemwide flight operations control center, after a bidding war with Charlotte and Phoenix led to state and local subsidies totaling $16.25 million being offered to US Air to build the center at Pittsburgh. The center worked on emergency operations for US Airways Flight 1549 after it landed in the Hudson River. The airline closed the center in 2015 as part of its merger with American Airlines. (The center was rebuilt as a 9-1-1 center for Allegheny County, which opened in 2019.) In June 2009, Delta Air Lines commenced a route to Paris using Boeing 757s. The carrier made it seasonal in 2011.

===Recent years===

When the airport opened in 1992, only 20% of passengers started or finished their trip in Pittsburgh with the rest connecting; as of 2025, 95% of travelers start or begin their trip in Pittsburgh. The closing of the US Airways hub allowed new low cost carriers to enter the market, creating more choices for local passengers. Pittsburgh has also been successful in attracting airlines to serve the region for the first time or to return to the market. Allegiant Air commenced service in February 2015 and established a base of operations later that year. Frontier Airlines re-entered the Pittsburgh airport in 2016 after a four-year absence. Spirit Airlines commenced service to seven destinations in 2017. Wow Air added year-round flights to Reykjavík in 2017. Wow left Pittsburgh due to financial difficulties in 2019 but Icelandair began flying to Reykjavík in 2024. Alaska Airlines began service in 2019 with a nonstop route to Seattle/Tacoma. British Airways began service to London-Heathrow in 2019 aboard a Boeing 787.

In 2017, Pittsburgh was the first U.S. airport to be named Airport of the Year by &quot;Air Transport World&quot;. Starting in September 2017, non-ticketed persons were allowed to access the airside terminal and gates, similar to pre-9/11 policy. Pittsburgh was the first airport (since 9/11) in the nation to allow non-passengers to pass through security to dine and shop in a post-security terminal. Participants can sign up for myPITpass on the airport&#x27;s website and must pass through the alternate security checkpoint before continuing through to the Airmall in the airside terminal. The airport became one of the first in the United States to use a new TSA system called Credential Authentication Technology, which phases out the use of boarding passes at TSA security checkpoints in favor of a stronger system that verifies passengers based solely on a government-issued ID.

As airlines grounded planes in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pittsburgh airport allowed American Airlines and Republic Airways to park nearly 100 planes on the airport&#x27;s expansive tarmac. As airline travel rebounded, airlines added or expanded service at PIT. In July 2021, Breeze Airways began nonstop service to four cities and has since expanded to 10 destinations. In October 2021, Sun Country Airlines announced it would enter the Pittsburgh market with service to its hub at Minneapolis/St. Paul. In February 2024, monthly passenger counts at the airport surpassed pre-pandemic travel levels for the first time. Later that year, in June, the TSA recorded 970,000 travelers through the checkpoint, the highest count since 2005. The airport counted 9.95 million passengers in all of 2024, the highest passenger count since 2006.

===New terminal===

In September 2017, Allegheny County Airport Authority officials announced a $1.1 billion plan to renovate and reconfigure the terminal complex, including a new landside terminal and a new parking garage. Under the proposal, the current landside building would be demolished if another use is not found, and the number of gates would be reduced from 75 to 51. A new landside building would be constructed between the airside terminal&#x27;s concourses C and D, with new security and baggage facilities, a new international arrivals area, and many other amenities to serve passengers. The board chairman of the Airport Authority, David Minnotte, said, &quot;The people of Pittsburgh finally get an airport built for them and not USAir&quot;. No taxpayer dollars would be used to construct the new facility, and it will be instead financed with floating bonds, grants, passenger facility charges, and revenue from natural gas drilling on airport property.

Construction was originally expected to begin in summer 2020 and the new terminal was slated to open in 2023. In April 2020, however, airport officials decided to delay the selling of bonds and start of construction due to the coronavirus pandemic. In February 2021, airport officials announced early site and construction work would begin in spring 2021 with an increased budget of $1.39 billion. The airlines serving the airport agreed to fund $182 million in construction site preparation work for the project. An additional $28.8 million in funding will come from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Construction finally began in July 2021 and the project is expected to be completed in October 2025.

Airport officials emphasized the local flair of the new terminal. Building materials were sourced locally, including the steel, and around 90% of construction workers live in the Pittsburgh region. The roof is intended to mimic the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania and the support columns are intended to resemble tree branches. The bridge and tunnel between the landside and airside terminals is intended to mirror the Fort Pitt Tunnel and Fort Pitt Bridge. An outdoor terrace will be accessible to passengers even after clearing security.

==Facilities==
The airport is partly in Findlay Township. The Air Reserve Station is in Moon Township.

===Runways===
PIT has a wide, open layout and four runways: three east–west parallel runways and a fourth crosswind runway. The airport&#x27;s two longest runways are and , allowing PIT to accommodate the largest airliners. Because of the development of non-aviation related business on airport land, PIT can add only one more runway (this number was as high as four in the past). With three parallel runways, simultaneous landings and/or departures can be performed in nearly any situation.

Runways 10L and 10R have Category III ILS (Instrument Landing System) approaches. Runway 28R is certified for Category I ILS and is authorized for Category II approaches but requires special aircrew and aircraft certification. Runways 28L and 32 have Category I ILS approaches. All runways have GPS approaches as well.

During westerly winds, Runway 28L serves as the primary arrival runway, while 28R serves as primary departure and secondary arrival runway. Runway 32 serves as the main arrival runway for general aviation traffic. During easterly winds, runway 10L serves as the primary arrival runway, 10R is the secondary arrival runway, while 10C is the departure runway.

===Terminal===

The airport complex consists of two main buildings, the &quot;Landside Terminal&quot; and the &quot;Airside Terminal&quot;. The terminal consists of 75 gates on four concourses; only 56 gates are available for use. After passing through the security checkpoint, passengers board one of two underground people movers that travel to the Airside Terminal, where all departure gates are located. All international arrivals, except for cities with United States border preclearance, pass through Concourse C. American Airlines has an Admirals Club on the mezzanine level of the airside terminal. The Club Lounge opened in October 2017 in the C Concourse across from gate C-52 near the center core and was renovated and expanded in 2019. The airport also operates a free lounge for active duty military and veterans in concourse C.

*Concourse A contains 25 gates.
*Concourse B contains 25 gates.
*Concourse C contains 6 gates.
*Concourse D contains 7 gates.

There is an AirMall in the airside terminal, operated by Fraport, with numerous retail stores and restaurants. It was one of the first of its kind in an airport and paved the way for similar shopping experiences at other airports. Tenants in the airport are required to charge the same amount as they do at non-airport locations. Before 9/11, anyone could shop in the airport, but it was closed to non-travelers after 9/11. In 2017, the AirMall was reopened to non-travelers who obtained a free access pass from the airport, but this access is temporarily suspended.

===Ground transportation===
PIT is located at Exit 53 of Interstate 376 and the Western Terminus Pennsylvania Route 576 (future I-576), and within of Interstate 79 and of Interstate 76, the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Interstate 70 to the south and Interstate 80 to the north are both less than an hour away. Just beyond Interstates 70 and 80, Interstate 77 to the west and Interstate 68 to the south are within 90 minutes of the airport.

PIT offers on-site parking patrolled by the Allegheny County Police. The local Grant Oliver Corporation ran the parking from the airport&#x27;s opening in 1952 until the Allegheny County Airport Authority chose to switch to national contractor LAZ Parking, which took over in October 2022 and will also oversee new facilities planned to open in 2024. Grant Oliver offered a GO FAST Pass account to pay for parking electronically via E-ZPass. This system was renamed to PIT Express Pass by LAZ. LAZ also offers online parking reservations. There are regular parking shuttles to the Long Term and Extended lots that can be accessed from the Baggage Claim level of the Landside Terminal. There are four options for parking: Short Term, Long Term, Extended, and Economy. The economy option was added in 2021. The short term garage has 2100 spaces and is attached to the landside terminal via the enclosed moving walkway. The long term section is also connected to the enclosed moving walkway and has 3,100 spaces available. The extended and economy sections have an outdoor walkway that leads to the enclosed moving walkway and have 8,000 spaces available.

Bus service is also available from Downtown Pittsburgh and the city&#x27;s University District (Oakland) via the Port Authority of Allegheny County&#x27;s 28X Route. Mountain Line Transit&#x27;s Grey Line also has service to areas south of Pittsburgh including Waynesburg, Pennsylvania; Morgantown, Fairmont, and Clarksburg, West Virginia. BCTA Transit formerly served locations north and westbound from the airport. The Pittsburgh Light Rail currently does not stop at the airport.

===Cargo area===
Pittsburgh International Airport has a sizeable freight business, with a Free-trade zone of , access to three class-one railroad freight lines, one interstate highway, and a location a few miles from the nation&#x27;s second largest inland port and within 500 miles of 80% of the nation&#x27;s population. Four cargo buildings provide more than of warehouse capacity and over of apron space. The airport has begun construction on a new 80,000 sq ft cargo facility with 17 truck loading docks and enough apron space for two Boeing 747 freighters to be loaded or unloaded simultaneously. The facility is scheduled to open in 2024.

Cargo traffic has increased considerably in recent years as airport officials have pitched Pittsburgh to cargo carriers as a more efficient alternative to clogged hubs like New York and Chicago. In 2017, Qatar Airways launched twice-weekly cargo service at Pittsburgh, backed by $1.5 million in subsidies. The effort was not very successful at first as Qatar failed to meet tonnage goals, and in December 2019 the route was suspended. However, Qatar resumed the flight in 2020 without any subsidies, and as of 2022 had increased operations to 3-4 flights per week. Several new cargo carriers began service to Pittsburgh in 2020 and 2021, including Cathay Pacific, SpiceXpress, and Amazon Air. In 2021, nearly 250 million pounds of cargo goods touched down at PIT, the largest figure since 2004 and a 30% increase over 2020.

The world&#x27;s leading caterer for air and business, LSG SkyChefs, in 2007 chose Pittsburgh as its sole Western Hemisphere manufacturing facility. It expanded its customer service center on the cargo side of the airport by and now employs over 100 people with the capacity of making nearly 25 million meals per year for distribution to flights all over the Americas. LSG SkyChefs cited the region&#x27;s strategic location for air and truck transport to major suppliers and customers, as well as the airport&#x27;s excellent record in maintaining and expanding capacity.

===Microgrid===
In 2018, the airport announced plans to construct its own microgrid, using natural gas and solar power as the primary power source for the airport, protecting it from power outages. In 2019, the airport authority awarded Peoples Natural Gas a 20-year contract to build, maintain, and operate the microgrid at no cost to the airport in exchange for the required land and an agreement to purchase the electricity for 20 years. The microgrid was completed in July 2021, making Pittsburgh the first airport in the world to receive its electricity entirely from a microgrid. The microgrid uses natural gas from the Marcellus Shale as well as solar panels. Most of the energy comes from natural gas; the 9,360 solar panels can generate up to 13% of its peak power. In its first year, the microgrid saved the airport an estimated $1 million in energy costs.

===Neighborhood 91===
In 2019, the airport announced the development of Neighborhood 91, a 195-acre hub for additive manufacturing on airport grounds. It is so named because Pittsburgh has 90 distinct neighborhoods. The development will house a complete end-to-end supply chain allowing products to be manufactured and finished in one place and then shipped around the world from the airport. The site is being developed as part of a partnership with the University of Pittsburgh and will have 1.4 million square feet of manufacturing and office space.

===Other facilities===
====Onsite hotel====
A Hyatt Regency hotel is located onsite and is directly connected to the landside terminal via moving walkway. The hotel also has a ballroom and meeting facilities. As part of a pilot program, hotel guests were allowed access to the post-security shops and restaurants without an airline ticket as long as they could pass through security. In 2017, airport officials opened post-security access to all non-flying persons who could pass through security, including hotel guests. A Sunoco-branded gas station is also located onsite. Both the hotel and the gas station draw power from the airport&#x27;s microgrid.

====Maintenance facilities====
American Airlines still has a maintenance base at Pittsburgh, which dates back to the US Air days. American Airlines maintains and repairs all its Airbus A320 family narrowbody fleet at Pittsburgh. In 2021, it extended its lease at the airport for five years. In 2024, the airline announced an expansion of the Pittsburgh facility to 600 jobs by 2025, making it American Airlines&#x27; second-largest maintenance base after Tulsa International Airport.

Republic Airways has also operated a maintenance and repair operations base at the airport since 2006. Its current lease will continue until 2028.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

===Cargo===
In 2021, FedEx accounted for 50% of all cargo traffic at the airport, followed by UPS at 33% and Amazon Air at 5%. In 2024, FedEx&#x27;s share dropped to 45% while UPS&#x27;s increased to 33% and Amazon Air&#x27;s increased to 15%. British Airways accounted for 3% of total freight in 2024 by hauling cargo on its passenger planes.

<text>The Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference (KCAC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The KCAC is the oldest conference in the NAIA and the second-oldest in the United States, tracing its history to 1890.

==History==
On February 15, 1890, the Kansas Intercollegiate Athletic Association was formed; it was the first successful attempt to organize Kansas colleges for the purposes of promoting and regulating amateur intercollegiate athletics. In addition to the private universities and colleges, the conference also included Kansas State Agriculture College (now Kansas State University), the University of Kansas, and Washburn University. In November of that year, the first college football game in Kansas was played between the Kansas Jayhawks and Baker University.

About 1902 the association allied with the Kansas College Athletic Conference, the first group to adopt a definite set of rules and regulations. By the 1920s the conference had changed its name to Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference and had grown to include 17 regular members and 2 allied members (no longer including the University of Kansas or Kansas State). In 1923 seven colleges withdrew to form the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

On December 1, 1928, the Kansas Intercollegiate Athletic Conference was formally disbanded and replaced by a new Kansas College Athletic Conference which included six members and formed the present legal entity. It was commonly referred to as the &quot;Little Six&quot;, in contrast to the Big Six Conference that eventually became the current Big 12. By 1968 the conference grew to include 12 members. It was organized into Northern and Southern divisions until 1970 when three colleges withdrew to join Missouri-based conferences. In the mid-1970s the name was changed to its current form.

===1905 night game===
:&quot;See 1905 Cooper vs. Fairmount football game&quot;

In the 1905 season, the Coleman Company set up temporary gas-powered lighting for a night game against Cooper College (now called the Sterling Warriors). It was the first night football game played west of the Mississippi River. Fairmount (now Wichita State University) won the game 24–0.

===1905 &quot;experimental&quot; game===
:&quot;See 1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game&quot;

On December 25, 1905, Fairmount played a game against the Washburn Ichabods using a set of experimental rules. The game was officiated by then Washburn head coach John H. Outland.

The experiment was considered a failure. Outland commented, &quot;It seems to me that the distance required in three downs would almost eliminate touchdowns, except through fakes or flukes.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that there was much kicking and that the game was considered much safer than regular play, but that the new rule was not &quot;conducive to the sport.&quot;

In his history of the sport of football, David M. Nelson concluded that &quot;the first forward passes were thrown at the end of the 1905 season in a game between Fairmount and Washburn colleges in Kansas.&quot; According to Nelson, Washburn completed three passes, and Fairmount completed two.

<doc id="262530" wikidata="Q1783795" url="?curid=262530" title="Rivière des Prairies">
<text>The Rivière des Prairies (; ), called the Back River in English, is a delta channel of the Ottawa River in southwestern Quebec, Canada. The Kanien&#x27;kehá:ka called it &quot;Skowanoti&quot;, meaning &quot;River behind the island&quot;. The river separates the cities of Laval and Montreal.

==Geography==
Flowing west to east, the Rivière des Prairies bisects the Hochelaga Archipelago and originates in the Lake of Two Mountains. It flows on either side of Île Bizard (part of Montreal), then divides the Island of Montreal (Montreal) to the south from Île Jésus (Laval) to the north, after which it flows into the St. Lawrence River at the eastern tip of the Island of Montreal.

The river contains a large number of islands, including Île Bizard, the Îles Laval (Île Bigras, Île Pariseau, Île Verte and Île Ronde) belonging to Laval, and Île de la Visitation, a nature park belonging to Montreal. There are also islands named Île Mercier, Île Ménard, Île Jasmin, Île Barwick, Île de Roxboro, Île aux Chats, Île Paton, Île Perry, Île Lapierre, Île Boutin, Île Rochon and Île Gagné, among many others.

The Rivière des Prairies has many rapids. Rapids are shown in several places on the 1879 map of Henry Whitmersome Hopkins, and on Gordon and Gotch&#x27;s map of the Island of Montreal from 1924. Named rapids of the river, starting from the west, are the &quot;Rapides de Cap-Saint-Jacques&quot;, the 
Lalemant(Dutchman) Rapids that are located between Île Bizard and Laval (with a ferry), the &quot;Rapides du Cheval Blanc&quot;(Whitehorse rapids) that are located in between the borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro and Sainte-Dorothée, the Laval rapids, the &quot;Sault-au-Récollet Rapids&quot; that are located north of Bordeaux Prison, and ending with the &quot;Rapides de la Rivière des Prairies&quot;.

The riverfront in the West Island area was famous for its beaches along the river. Some were named &quot;Crystal&quot;, &quot;Noel/Roy&quot;, &quot;Riviera&quot;, and Roxboro municipal beach 

==Environmental issues==
The river receives massive discharges of untreated liquid waste from metropolitan Montreal and the newly developed suburbs by way of over 150 discharge outlets. Whenever there is significant rainfall on the island of Montreal, household sewage is mixed with the city street rainwater and discharged untreated into the river. This sewage turns the river into essentially an open sewer. The sewage problem was reported in the year 1911., and a need to purify Montreal sewage in 1935.
 The Montreal Board of Trade (BOT) commissioned a report on the water pollution in the late 1950s, and the report was given to Premier Barrette.

Montreal has six drinking-water plants on the Island whose source of water is the Rivière des Prairies and Lac Saint Louis. Reportedly, Montreal and Quebec city drinking water is tested.

It is claimed modern sewage treatment techniques have reversed much of the damage from the sewage.
Some people consider the river clean again, starting in the year 1998, when most of the sewage was treated before being discharged. However, parts of the river are never suitable for swimming . Specifically the location of R.D.P. 140, the Rive-Boisée area has been polluted since the year 1971 is still polluted from raw sewage more than forty years later . The Rive-Boisée problem had been noticed and was reported to be repaired in 2014. The reason for the sewage problem is that the storm sewer drain system and the sanitary sewer system were mistakenly connected in many places, and it takes money to correct and repair. Reports from the R.S.M.A.(Réseau de suivi du milieu aquatique) dated 2021 on the water quality of RDP-140 indicate the problem has not been fixed.

From Bing maps, many of the sewage output locations can be seen on the river shoreline. The solution to the visible pollution (plastic bags, toilet paper, condoms) that accumulates on the shoreline is to use a type of a screen at all the storm drains and outlets that expel the rainwater-garbage mixture into the river.

== Early life ==
Anderson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the eldest of four sons born to Stuart Jay Anderson, a teacher, and Jocelyn Rhae Carter, an artist. He is of Norwegian, Scottish, Finnish-Swedish, English, German, Swedish and possibly Mohawk descent. His last name, Anderson, derives from his Finnish-Swedish paternal grandfather.

He grew up in Roseville, Minnesota, where he attended Alexander Ramsey High School. As a teenager, his dream of becoming a professional hockey player was ended when he broke both arms three weeks apart while playing hockey for the school team at the age of 18. According to Hockey Hall of Fame member Stan Mikita as of 2009, Anderson was &quot;a hockey nut and pretty damn good hockey player.&quot; He developed an early interest in music, art, and acting. For a short time, he tried to become a jazz musician.

Anderson studied to become an actor at St. Cloud State University and then at Ohio University but dropped out before he received his degree because he felt &quot;listless&quot;. Right after his junior year in college, he participated with friends in a cross-country bicycle ride from Minnesota to Alaska. He then moved to North Hollywood along with his friend and girlfriend before moving to New York City, finally settling in Los Angeles. He worked as a whale handler in a marine mammal show, as entertainment director at Marineland, a musician in medieval dinner theater, and as a street mime and juggler. He has stated that this period was &quot;the happiest of [his] life&quot; and has expressed an interest in teaching juggling, clowning, and other circus arts to disadvantaged youths.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Anderson&#x27;s first screen role was &quot;The Birthday Party,&quot; a 1975 short film produced by the Marine Reserve Public Affairs Unit to mark the 200th anniversary of the founding of the United States Marine Corps. Shortly afterwards, Anderson joined the American soap opera, &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Dr. Jeff Webber from 1976 to 1981. Afterwards, Anderson guest-starred as one half of an interracial couple in an episode of &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; that also served as a backdoor pilot. In 1982–1983 he starred as Adam in the CBS television series &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (based very loosely on the movie of the same name). In the 1983–1984 season, he played Lieutenant Simon Adams on the 22-week Dennis Weaver series &quot;Emerald Point N.A.S.&quot; on CBS, paired onscreen with Celia Warren (Susan Dey), the wife of naval lawyer Jack Warren (Charles Frank). Anderson then played Tony Kaiser in the acclaimed TV movie &quot;Ordinary Heroes&quot;, which aired in 1986.

==== &quot;MacGyver&quot; ====

Anderson came to fame in the lead role of Angus MacGyver in the hit television series &quot;MacGyver,&quot; which lasted from 1985 to 1992 and was highly successful throughout its seven-year run. The character Angus MacGyver, also known as just MacGyver or Mac, was an optimistic action hero who was notable for using a Swiss Army knife instead of a firearm as his tool of choice. Anderson stated that he was initially drawn to the role because he &quot;was intrigued by the idea of a TV hero who had an aversion to guns&quot;, noting his own aversion to violence and how the MacGyver character differed from popular action heroes of that time.

Anderson would go on to produce two follow-up movies to &quot;MacGyver&quot; in 1994. After &quot;MacGyver&quot; ended, Anderson stated &quot;&quot;MacGyver&quot; was seven years of being in virtually every frame that was shot and having absolutely no life at all.&quot;

During the run of the program, Anderson suffered a number of injuries related to doing his own stunt work, some of which required surgery. He suffered a compressed disc in his back when he fell into a hole while filming an episode midway through the first season of the show; he continued filming in a &quot;fairly crippled&quot; state for a year and a half before having surgery that improved his condition, but still experienced pain from the incident. Anderson described it as an &quot;exploded&quot; disc that caused a &quot;severe sciatic condition&quot;.

=== Later career ===
==== &quot;Stargate&quot; ====

From 1997 to 2005, Anderson starred as Jack O&#x27;Neill in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, based on the movie &quot;Stargate&quot; starring Kurt Russell and James Spader. John Symes, president of Metro–Goldwyn–Mayer (MGM), called Anderson himself and asked him if he wanted a part in the series. Anderson watched the &quot;Stargate&quot; film over and over again and came to the conclusion that the film had &quot;great potential&quot; and signed a contract with the &quot;Stargate&quot; producers. Anderson agreed to become involved with the project if his character was allowed significantly more comedic leeway than Kurt Russell&#x27;s character in the feature film. He also requested &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; be more of an ensemble show so that he would not be carrying the plot alone as he did on &quot;MacGyver&quot;. According to Anderson, he also would ad-lib &quot;a lot of lines to bring a slightly sarcastic humor to the character&quot;. In season eight, he chose to have his character &quot;promoted&quot; to base commander on Don S. Davis&#x27;s advice. This enabled Davis to retire from acting due to his ailing health and Anderson to take over the smaller role which involved far less on-location shooting so that he could spend more time with his young daughter. The following season, Anderson terminated his status as star and producer of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; opting to make several guest appearances per season instead, allowing his sizable role to be filled by veteran actors Ben Browder (replacing Anderson as field commander), Claudia Black (replacing Anderson as the comic relief) and Emmy nominee Beau Bridges (replacing Anderson as Base commander).

At the Air Force Association&#x27;s 57th Annual Air Force Anniversary Dinner in Washington, D.C., on September 14, 2004, then-Air Force Chief-of-Staff General John P. Jumper presented Anderson with an award for his role as star and executive producer of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, a series which portrayed the Air Force in a positive light from its premiere. Anderson was also made an honorary Air Force brigadier general.

==== Other work ====
In 1995, he co-starred with John de Lancie in &quot;Legend&quot;, a comic series of only twelve episodes about a dime novel writer in the Wild West who, against his will, has to play the role of his own fictional character. Originally written as a TV movie, with the decision to make &quot;Legend&quot; a series, the original teleplay became the two-hour pilot episode. Anderson was applauded for his roles as Ernest Pratt and Nicodemus Legend by many critics, most notably John O&#x27;Connor from &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

A great fan of the television show &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which he repeatedly referenced during his time on &quot;SG-1&quot;, Anderson was invited in 2005 to guest star on the show. He voiced himself in the episode &quot;Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore&quot;, in which the actor was kidnapped by Selma and Patty Bouvier, Marge Simpson&#x27;s sisters, his MacGyver character having been their longstanding heartthrob. Dan Castellaneta, the voice actor who portrays Homer Simpson (among other characters), made a guest appearance on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (&quot;Citizen Joe&quot;) and, in describing his unnatural ability to see the life events of Jack O&#x27;Neill, made reference to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s fondness for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

Anderson briefly reprised his role as Angus MacGyver in 2006 when he appeared in a MasterCard commercial during Super Bowl XL. While the plot follows the &quot;MacGyver Formula&quot;, it is somewhat satirical of the series, showing unlikely if not impossible solutions to the obstacles faced by Anderson&#x27;s character (in one shot, he cuts through a thick rope with a pine-scented air freshener). The official MasterCard website for the commercial refers to it as &quot;the Return of MacGyver&quot;.

Lee David Zlotoff, the creator of &quot;MacGyver&quot;, announced on May 3, 2008, that a &quot;MacGyver&quot; film was in production. Anderson expressed interest in revisiting his role; however, the film has not been made or released. 

Anderson cameoed as MacGyver in what seemed to be a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; advertisement parody featuring the show&#x27;s recurring character MacGruber (portrayed by Will Forte), but was rather a real commercial for both &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and Pepsi, in which the titular character becomes obsessed with the soft drink. This aired three times during the January 31, 2009, &quot;SNL&quot; broadcast, and the second part aired again during Super Bowl XLIII on the following day.

Anderson has also played the role of General Jack O&#x27;Neill in &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, which first aired in October 2009.

Anderson joined the cast of &quot;Fairly Legal&quot; on USA Network in fall 2010 in the recurring role of David Smith, appearing in three episodes.

=== Other creative works ===
Anderson has served as an executive producer in six shows in which he has acted himself: &quot;MacGyver: Lost Treasure of Atlantis&quot;, &quot;MacGyver: Trail to Doomsday&quot;, &quot;Legend&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;Firehouse&quot; and &quot;From Stargate to Atlantis: Sci Fi Lowdown&quot;.

Anderson composed the song &quot;Eau d&#x27;Leo&quot; for the &quot;MacGyver&quot; episode &quot;The Negotiator&quot;.

Together with Michael Greenburg, Anderson created the Gekko Film Corporation. The company was involved with &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, producing every episode from 1997 to 2007 with the exception of 2006. The company itself has served as Anderson&#x27;s backing agency.

== Charity work ==
Anderson has supported Waterkeeper Alliance, an organization trying to stop water pollution.

Anderson is a member of the Board of Trustees for &quot;Challengers Boys and Girls Club&quot;, a youth organization established in 1968 with the help of &quot;MacGyver&quot; producer Stephen Downing, and featured in an episode from season 4 of the show.

Anderson received the 1995 Celebrity Award from the Make-a-Wish Foundation because of his commitment to the foundation. He is also a supporter for various Sclerosis Society non-profit organizations and has done several public service announcements to show his support for the various organizations.

Anderson is an avid supporter of the Special Olympics and was one of many speakers at the 1991 opening ceremonies.

In recent years, Anderson has helped several environmental organizations around the world. He is a member of Board of Advisors of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and has worked with the members of the Earth Rivers Expeditions to Produce River Project.

== Personal life ==
Anderson divides his time among Vancouver, Los Angeles and northern Minnesota. A self-described &quot;winter sports fanatic&quot;, he loves hockey and skiing. In 1998, he noted that he &quot;had to slow it down a little bit&quot; due to having &quot;a couple of reconstructed knees.&quot; During filming of &quot;SG-1&quot;, he orchestrated both street and ice hockey games consisting of cast and crew. He was also a race car driver during the &quot;MacGyver&quot; years.

From 1996 to 2003, his partner was Apryl A. Prose, mother of his only child, Wylie Quinn Annarose Anderson (born on August 2, 1998). Anderson left &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; because he wanted to spend more time with his daughter stating, &quot;Being a father, well, I don&#x27;t know if this is a change, but it makes me want to get out of here faster. Get off the clock. Just &#x27;cause the baby is my reason for living, my reason for coming to work.&quot;

<doc id="262534" wikidata="Q6840794" url="?curid=262534" title="Mid-South Conference">
<text>The Mid-South Conference (MSC) is a college athletic conference affiliated with the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Member institutions are located in Kentucky and Tennessee. The league is headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and the commissioner is Eric Leach.

The Mid-South Conference has 7 full members: Bethel (TN), Campbellsville, Cumberland (TN), Cumberlands (KY), Freed–Hardeman, Georgetown (KY) and Lindsey Wilson. Six of these members sponsor football; Freed–Hardeman does not.

The Mid-South Conference also has six associate members that compete primarily in other conferences. Faulkner, Kentucky Christian, Union Commonwealth and recently former member Bluefield are associate members of the MSC for football and men&#x27;s volleyball, and Reinhardt is an associate member of the MSC for football and men&#x27;s volleyball. This gave the conference 13 members for football. In the spring of 2016, the conference expanded to 20 members, adding the six football members of the Sun Conference, as well as Faulkner University for football, On January 4, 2018, the conference added Keiser University for football, and St. Thomas announced in July they were joining the conference for football in 2019. Another Sun Conference member, Florida Memorial in Miami Gardens, Florida, joined the MSC as an affiliate member for football in 2020, after re-adding the sport.

==History==
In April 2018, Thomas More University (then Thomas More College), which had been an NAIA member before moving to NCAA Division III in 1990, announced that it had been formally invited to rejoin the NAIA in the 2019–20 academic year as a member of the Mid-South Conference. The school, while acknowledging that it was considering this move, denied published reports that it had accepted the invitation. Thomas More eventually confirmed in July that it would join the Mid-South in 2019.

In 2020, Bethel University became a Mid-South full member, brought track and field back to the MSC, and transferred all sports other than football and archery to the conference (prior to that, Bethel was an associate member of the MSC for football and archery only); additionally, Freed–Hardeman and UT Southern, then known as Martin Methodist College, also joined Mid-South.

In December 2020, Life University also announced its departure from the MSC for the Southern States Athletic Conference for the 2022–23 academic year.

Most recently, Thomas More announced in August 2021 that it would return to the NCAA, but this time in Division II as a member of the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC). It joined the G-MAC as a provisional member in July 2022, but continued as an NAIA member and in the Mid-South through 2022–23, after which it started G-MAC competition. Later, the Sun Conference announced on December 22, 2021, that it would reinstate football starting with the 2022 season. Then in July 2022, the Appalachian Athletic Conference announced it would add football as a sponsored sport.

<text>Jade Cerisa Lorraine Goody (5 June 1981 – 22 March 2009) was an English media personality. She was a contestant on the third series of the Channel 4 reality show &quot;Big Brother&quot; in 2002. Following her eviction from the show, Goody went on to star in her own television programmes, which in turn led to her launching a variety of products under her own name. 

Immediately criticised by the British press for her perceived lack of decorum and intelligence, Goody was dubbed by multiple outlets as &quot;the most hated woman in Britain&quot;. The country&#x27;s celebrity magazines were less derisive, publishing reports of her affable nature and competent school performance from those who knew her. Public opinion of Goody reached its most negative in January 2007, when she was involved in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; racism controversy while appearing as a housemate on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 5&quot;. Following her eviction, she made a number of apologies, but continued to garner negative public reactions. 

In August 2008, Goody participated in &quot;Bigg Boss&quot;, the Indian version of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, but left the show early and returned to the UK after finding out that she had cervical cancer. By February 2009, the cancer had metastasized and she was terminally ill. Goody died from cervical cancer in the early hours of 22 March 2009, at the age of 27. Public opinion of Goody had softened by the time of her death. Sky Living broadcast five tribute shows from 2009 to 2012, documenting her life.

==Early life==
Jade Cerisa Lorraine Goody was born in King&#x27;s College Hospital in London on 5 June 1981, the daughter of English mother Jackiey Budden and English-Jamaican father Andrew Goody. Her paternal grandfather, Winston Coyne, was from the West Indies and emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1956. Supporters of the far-right National Front (NF) verbally abused Goody&#x27;s father. Her mother was a drug addict and her father was a pimp. Goody&#x27;s father suffered from substance dependence and had a criminal history, including a four-year term for robbery. He and Budden separated when Goody was two; estranged from his daughter while Budden raised her, he died of a drug overdose in Bournemouth in August 2005. At the age of five, Goody made an uncredited appearance as a primary school student in the 1986 television film &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;, which later spawned the television series of the same name. Before entering the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house, Goody worked as a dental nurse and lived in Upshire, Essex, where she was still living when she died.

==Career==

===2002–2003: &quot;Big Brother 3&quot;===
When Goody appeared on &quot;Big Brother 3&quot;, she was ridiculed by the British tabloid press for her lack of general knowledge. She thought the English city of Cambridge was in London; when told that it was in East Anglia, she assumed East Anglia was outside Britain and referred to it as &quot;East Angula&quot;. She was also criticised by the tabloid press during her time in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house for backstabbing and an evening when she cavorted drunk and naked.

===2003–2006: Initial fame and Sky Living series===
Goody appeared in her own reality TV shows and, regularly, in celebrity, trivia and gossip-oriented women&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;OK!&quot;. She participated in the 2006 London Marathon but did not finish (collapsing after of the course), and recovered overnight at the Royal London Hospital. Before the marathon, Goody described her preparations to TV chef Gordon Ramsay: &quot;I&#x27;ve been eating curry, Chinese and drinking.&quot; She said afterwards, &quot;I don&#x27;t really understand miles. I didn&#x27;t actually know how far it was going to be ... I didn&#x27;t want to let everyone down.&quot; Goody raised £565.20 for her chosen charity, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

On 16 February 2004, Goody entered the &quot;Back to Reality&quot; house on Channel 5. The series, similar to &quot;Big Brother&quot;, featured contestants from other reality shows such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She was evicted on day 20.

In 2005, Goody created and introduced her own fragrance (Shh...) with distributor Jigsaw ESL, who gave its exclusive rights to Superdrug. Shh... became Superdrug&#x27;s third-bestselling fragrance, behind Kylie Minogue&#x27;s and Victoria Beckham&#x27;s. On 2 May 2006, &quot;&quot; was published. That same year she won a celebrity edition of the ITV singing game show &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; as Lynn Anderson performing &quot;Rose Garden&quot;.

===2007–2008: &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 5&quot; and racism controversy===

On 5 January 2007 Goody, her boyfriend Jack Tweed and her mother entered the house for &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 5&quot;. She had just placed 25th in a &quot;Heat&quot; poll of the world&#x27;s most influential people, with lifetime earnings of £8 million. A number of complaints were received by British broadcasting regulator Ofcom about the behaviour of Jo O&#x27;Meara, Danielle Lloyd and Goody towards housemate Shilpa Shetty. By 20 January Ofcom received more than 44,500 complaints from the public (a record at the time), and Channel 4 received an additional 3,000 complaints.

Among Goody&#x27;s remarks were, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen how she goes in and out of people&#x27;s arseholes&quot; and Shetty &quot;makes [her] skin crawl&quot;. She also called Shetty &quot;Shilpa Fuckawalla&quot; and &quot;Shilpa Poppadom&quot;. Other, unbroadcast incidents of racism were later alleged, including a late-night limerick game between O&#x27;Meara, Lloyd, Goody and Tweed in which the word &quot;Paki&quot; was implied but not said. Goody allegedly wondered aloud if Lloyd used &quot;the P-word&quot;, and referred to Shetty as &quot;Shilpa Pashwa whoever you fucking are&quot;.

The incident triggered an international outcry, receiving extensive coverage in the Indian media (where Gordon Brown, then British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was visiting at the time). Brown condemned the programme for damaging the impression of Britain as a country of tolerance. In a 17 January statement, Channel 4 defended the programme against charges &quot;of overt racism or racial abuse&quot;.

Goody was evicted from the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house on 19 January 2007, receiving 82 per cent of the vote when she was up against Shetty. Channel 4 prevented crowds from gathering outside the house, and cancelled her scheduled press conference. In an interview with Davina McCall shortly afterwards, Goody said she was &quot;disgusted with [her]self&quot; after seeing a video of the alleged bullying. Her much-publicised return to the Big Brother house was called &quot;a terrible decision&quot; by publicist Max Clifford: &quot;It looks like she has ruined a very lucrative career&quot;. At this time Goody was a supporter of the anti-bullying charity Act Against Bullying, which dropped her. In an interview with the &quot;Daily Star&quot;, Goody said that her abuse of Shetty ruined her girl-next-door image.

Although Shetty did not lodge an official complaint about racist behaviour with &quot;Big Brother&quot;, her allegations compelled police to investigate the possible classification of her treatment as &quot;racial hatred&quot; under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986. In a statement, the Hertfordshire police said that it was &quot;investigating allegations of racist behaviour in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house and will be conducting enquiries, including a review of the tapes. We will continue to liaise with Ofcom and with Endemol, whom we have strongly encouraged to ensure that any form of behaviour that could raise similar concerns, does not occur. We will continue to closely monitor the situation over the next few days. Hertfordshire Constabulary will not tolerate racism in any form and is taking these allegations seriously. The constabulary has experience of investigating and resolving incidents in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house in past seasons&quot;.

According to a Channel 4 spokeswoman, &quot;Big Brother&quot; intervened so the contestants would &quot;realise that what they have said has been misconstrued in the house&quot;. The idea, she said, was to allow the housemates &quot;to explain themselves&quot; to their fellow contestants. This was followed by a series of apologies to Shetty from the housemates, and her belief that Goody was not a racist: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade&#x27;s end ... I think that there are a lot of insecurities from her end but it&#x27;s definitely not racial&quot;. However, Shetty was unaware of all the alleged insults (often made behind her back). Channel 4 was rebuked by Ofcom, which received more than 54,000 complaints, for its handling of the scandal.

Goody initially denied that her comments were racist: &quot;She is Indian, thinking of an Indian name and only thing I could think of was Indian food. Wasn&#x27;t racial at all. It was not to offend any Indian out there.&quot; On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty could be seen as racist. In a video on the BBC News website, Goody said, &quot;I know that things that I don&#x27;t think are necessarily racist ... could be ... And I am sincerely sorry for the pain and hurt I&#x27;ve caused to Shilpa&#x27;s family. I am wrong ... I am wrong and I know that my words and my actions were wrong and I&#x27;m not trying to justify that in any way – I am wrong, and the people who have complained are not wrong. They&#x27;re just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.&quot;

===2008–2009: Return to the public eye, &quot;Big Boss&quot; and final projects===
Goody said in April 2008 that she planned to introduce her second fragrance line, Controversial. In mid-2008, she appeared on &quot;Bigg Boss 2&quot;, the Indian version of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, at a rumoured salary of £100,000. Goody entered the house on 17 August, saying in her opening videotape that the incident with Shetty was &quot;in the past&quot; and she was &quot;not proud of it&quot;. Two days into the show she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and immediately withdrew, flying home to England. Scenes of Goody learning of her diagnosis were not broadcast in India.

A reality-television documentary, &quot;Living with Jade Goody&quot;, was shown in September 2008 as part of the &quot;Living with...&quot; series on Living TV. In October she opened her second beauty salon, &quot;Homme Fatel&quot; (for men), and her second autobiography (&quot;Jade: Catch a Falling Star&quot;, covering her time on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 5&quot;) was published by John Blake Publishing. A documentary film, &quot;Jade&#x27;s Cancer Battle&quot;, was aired on 11 December with further shows planned if Goody could participate. At the end of 2008, she played the Wicked Queen in a Christmas pantomime version of &quot;Snow White&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln to critical praise, but withdrew from the production in January 2009 for health reasons.

==Personal life==
Goody had two sons during her 2002 to 2004 relationship with television presenter Jeff Brazier: Bobby, who was born in June 2003 and Freddy, who was born in September 2004. In 2006, she began a relationship with Jack Tweed, who appeared with her on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. In June 2007, she had a miscarriage. After allegations of Tweed&#x27;s infidelity they broke up, later reconciling. Tweed lived with Goody and her children in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, until his imprisonment for a December 2006 assault on a 16-year-old boy. He served four months of an 18-month sentence before his release on 27 January 2009, with electronic monitoring and a curfew. Goody and Tweed exchanged rings on 15 February in a private, informal ceremony on the banks of the River Thames, and they married on 22 February at Down Hall country house. Goody wore a £3,500 Manuel Mota dress, a gift from Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed. The couple signed an exclusive £700,000 deal with &quot;OK!&quot; magazine for photographs of the ceremony, and Tweed was exempted from his curfew for 22 and 23 February.

==Illness and death==
Goody had a number of health scares during the 2000s. In 2002 (shortly before her &quot;Big Brother 3&quot; appearance) a cervical smear test revealed abnormal cells, a possible indicator of cancer. She was tested for iridocyclitis in 2004 and bowel cancer in 2006, with negative results for each. Goody had hospital tests in early August 2008, after her fourth cancer scare; she had collapsed four times. On 19 August, while she was on the Indian reality show &quot;Bigg Boss&quot;, Goody was told that test results confirmed cervical cancer. According to her spokesperson, &quot;It looks like her cancer is at an early stage but we will have to wait until she gets back to Britain and sees a specialist and has more tests&quot;.

On 1 September 2008, it was reported that Goody&#x27;s cancer was &quot;advanced and life-threatening&quot; and she would have surgery followed by chemotherapy. Doctors gave her a 65 per cent chance of survival. Further tests and a radical hysterectomy &quot;went well&quot;, according to her publicist, and Goody began chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÉ, Goody said she had begun planning her funeral, was losing her hair and had decided not to explain her illness to her children, aged 4 and 5 at the time.

On 4 February 2009, Goody&#x27;s publicist, Max Clifford, confirmed that her cancer had spread to her liver, bowel and groin. A previous 40 per cent chance of survival was withdrawn, and she began treatment to prolong her life. On 7 February, Clifford reported that Goody had emergency surgery in London to remove a tumour on her bowel.

On 14 February, Clifford confirmed media reports that doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London had classified her cancer as terminal; she could die within weeks, and at best was unlikely to survive more than a few months: &quot;She was informed yesterday that tragically, she&#x27;s terminally ill. She was obviously devastated.&quot; Goody then began drawing up a will and planning for the care of her two sons.

On 5 March in the Royal Marsden Hospital, Goody asked to be baptised; two days later, she and her sons were christened. Clifford confirmed that this was her last public appearance, and she had already said her goodbyes to her family: &quot;We&#x27;re hoping and praying that Jade pulls through, but the fact of the matter is that she now only has a short time to live.&quot; He confirmed that during the next 24 hours her doctors could assess how long Goody had to live, but she had a very short time left in any case. Jack Tweed was allowed to extend his curfew, spending a last night with his wife before she said goodbye to the rest of her family.

When the news spread that Goody&#x27;s cancer was terminal, medical authorities in the UK began reporting a surge in requests from women (particularly younger women) for cervical-cancer screening. This reversed a trend which had seen demand for screening decline over the past decade, with the greatest decline among women aged 25–29.

As a result of the publicity surrounding Goody&#x27;s illness, on 13 March 2009 government health ministers agreed to review the National Health Service policy not to screen for cervical cancer until age 25 in England (age 20 in the rest of the UK). That day, she issued a press release that she was &quot;immensely proud&quot; to have prompted the review.

Goody died in her sleep at her home in Upshire, Essex, in the early hours of 22 March 2009, at the age of 27. Her reported time of death varies by source. Her mother, husband, and family friend Kevin Adams were at her bedside when she died. Her funeral service took place at noon on 4 April at St John the Baptist Church in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, and she was buried in her wedding dress later that day near her home in Epping Forest. The funeral cortège included a Bentley. Her sons did not attend the funeral. Thousands of mourners followed the funeral service on large screens outside the church. It was broadcast live on Sky News, which followed the service from outside since Goody had wanted a private ceremony for friends and family.

==Media coverage==
===Tributes===

Goody&#x27;s death was widely covered by the British media, and the BBC was criticised for its extensive coverage of her illness. She received tributes from many different areas of society. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that she was &quot;a courageous woman both in life and death and the whole country has admired her determination to provide a bright future for her children&quot;. From 2009 to 2012, Sky Living aired five tributes to Goody, documenting her early life, fame, and final months. The final episode of &quot;Big Brother&quot; on Channel 4 featured a 15-minute tribute, praising her as the ultimate &quot;Big Brother&quot; contestant.

In April 2009, Digital Spy called Goody the &quot;ultimate reality TV star&quot;, and plans were announced for &quot;Jade the Musical&quot;. That month Michael Parkinson wrote that Goody had become media property &quot;to be manipulated and exploited till the day she died&quot;, representing &quot;all that is paltry and wretched about Britain&quot;. On 29 December 2009 &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that, according to an online tribute site, Goody was the most-mourned celebrity of 2009 and received over 600 tributes, which was more than Patrick Swayze, Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson who had all died that year too. The premiere of &quot;Big Brother 10&quot; was dedicated to her memory, and a tribute was shown on the last episode of &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;.

A show aired from 7 to 21 August 2019 documenting her life from her rise to fame to her death featuring never before seen footage and contributors to the programme who had never discussed Jade publicly since her death, including Davina McCall, Dermot O&#x27;Leary and her ex-partner and father of her children, Jeff Brazier.

===Cervical cancer awareness===
The day of Goody&#x27;s funeral, a spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK said:

In October 2009, it was reported that the number of women between 25 and 64 having pap testing the United Kingdom had grown by 12 per cent during the previous year, an increase (after year-to-year declines since 2002) credited to Goody&#x27;s public battle with cervical cancer. Sky News health correspondent Thomas Moore said:

According to Health Secretary Andy Burnham, &quot;Jade&#x27;s bravery and openness in her fight against cervical cancer has brought home to young women across the country the importance of regularly going for these checks.&quot; Gordon Brown stated, &quot;Her family can be extremely proud of the work she has done to raise awareness of cervical cancer which will benefit thousands of women across the UK.&quot;

<text>The Rivière des Mille Îles (, &quot;Thousand Islands River&quot;) is a channel of the Ottawa River in southwestern Quebec, Canada and runs into the Rivière des Prairies. It is long.

It divides Île Jésus (the city of Laval) from the North Shore, the northern mainland suburbs of Montreal, such as Deux-Montagnes, Saint-Eustache, Boisbriand, Rosemère, Lorraine, Bois-des-Filion, Sainte-Thérèse, and Terrebonne.

The river rises at the narrowing of the Lake of Two Mountains, where the Ottawa River widens as it feeds into the St Lawrence at Montreal, and flows west to east. It joins the Rivière des Prairies at the eastern tip of Île Jésus, which shortly thereafter joins the St. Lawrence at the eastern tip of the Island of Montreal.

As its name suggests, the river contains many small islands which are part of the Hochelaga Archipelago. It is not to be confused with the Thousand Islands at the head of the St. Lawrence River, in Ontario and New York State.

<doc id="262540" wikidata="Q853886" url="?curid=262540" title="Harry Reid International Airport">
<text>Harry Reid International Airport , formerly known as McCarran International Airport, is an international airport serving the Las Vegas Valley, a metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Nevada. It is located south of downtown Las Vegas, in the unincorporated area of Paradise, and covers of land.

Reid is owned by Clark County and operated by the county&#x27;s Department of Aviation. The airport is named after the late U.S. congressman and senator from Nevada, Harry Reid. It has four runways and two terminals with five gate areas (concourses) all connected with a people mover system. Reid is one of two airports in the United States with slot machines inside the terminals. 

The airport opened in January 1943 as Alamo Field and initially catered to general aviation. In December 1948, it was rechristened for U.S. senator Pat McCarran, and commercial airlines shifted to it from the Las Vegas Army Airfield. Passenger counts increased in the 1950s as the Strip expanded, leading to the construction of a new terminal. McCarran later came to be seen as the model for the common-use approach to airport resources in the United States and pioneered radio-frequency identification of baggage. Terminal 3 was added in 2012, and the airport was renamed in honor of Senator Reid in 2021.

Reid is served by over 30 airlines and is an operating base for Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines, JSX, Southwest Airlines, and Spirit Airlines. Southwest became its dominant carrier in the 1990s. In 2024, over 58.4 million passengers passed through the airport, the most in its history. Reid has international flights to cities in Asia, Europe, and North America.

==History==

=== Origins ===
George Crockett, a flight instructor, built Alamo Field in 1942 on the site currently occupied by Harry Reid Airport. Crockett named it in honor of his forefather Davy Crockett, who had fought in the Battle of the Alamo. The airfield opened in January 1943. It catered to general aviation and included three gravel runways, a flight school, and a terminal building. Meanwhile, all commercial airlines flew into the Las Vegas Army Airfield. They shared the facility with the Army Air Forces, which had been operating an air base there since the attack on Pearl Harbor. The base closed in 1946.

With the onset of the Cold War, the military said it was amenable to reopening the base, but it wanted the airlines to move elsewhere. Crockett was willing to let them use his airfield, so the Clark County Commission entered into negotiations with him. In the meantime, the county held a bond election to fund construction work that would enable Alamo Field to handle commercial operations. Proponents of the bond issue, who included the chamber of commerce and casino executives, sought the economic benefits of both an air base and a modern airport capable of serving the increasing numbers of tourists that they expected to arrive. Voters approved the bond in 1947. With the help of U.S. senator Pat McCarran of Nevada, the county finalized a deal with Crockett to purchase his airfield the following year. On December 19, 1948, the airport was renamed McCarran Field and began receiving passenger flights.

=== Expansion ===
The growth of the Las Vegas casino industry during the 1950s fueled a rise in air traffic; the city went from receiving 36,000 passengers in 1948 to nearly one million in 1959. In September 1960, United Airlines became the first carrier to offer jet flights to Las Vegas. The airport was ill-equipped to handle the increasing passenger counts and the advent of commercial jetliners. Consequently, the county built a new terminal, which opened in March 1963. Another expansion project, which included adding Concourses A and B and lengthening the runways, ended in 1974. However, traffic levels had already rendered the project insufficient by the time it was completed. Airport officials therefore prepared for further expansion. 

The deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 led to an increase in the number of carriers at McCarran and prompted officials to accelerate their expansion plans. In October 1985, a central terminal, Concourse C, and a people mover between the two buildings opened.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, America West Airlines was the busiest airline at McCarran. The carrier began offering cheap night flights to Las Vegas in 1986. It ultimately developed a hub at the airport that functioned between 10pm and 2am every night. The strategy capitalized on the fact that Las Vegas was open 24 hours a day and enabled the airline to decrease costs. America West charged low fares because it was the only carrier operating such a large number of flights at that time of night. Most of its customers were tourists, while the remainder were changing planes. By the late 1990s, Southwest Airlines had overtaken America West as McCarran&#x27;s largest carrier and occupied all the gates in Concourse C. The company&#x27;s high frequency of flights, cheap tickets, and collaboration with local resorts contributed to its success in the Las Vegas market.

Multiple projects were finished during the 1990s. The Charter/International Terminal, later renamed Terminal 2, opened in December 1991. A cargo center was dedicated two years later. In 1994, a tunnel beneath the east–west runways that linked the airport to the Las Vegas Beltway opened. A nine-level parking facility was completed in 1996, and in June 1998, the first two wings of Concourse D were inaugurated. McCarran also gained its first scheduled flights to Europe and Asia. In November 1996, Condor launched a route to Cologne, and Northwest Airlines commenced service to its hub at Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport in June 1998. With the backing of two casinos, National Airlines set up a hub in Las Vegas the following year. The company specialized in low-fare flights to cities on the East Coast. Other casinos responded by arranging package deals with larger airlines. This and other factors led to National&#x27;s demise in 2002.

=== Innovation and new terminal ===
Officials started to introduce new technologies. In the late 1990s, they began following a common-use strategy, where airlines share airport facilities. The airport first deployed computer systems known as common-use terminal equipment (CUTE) at gates and check-in counters. McCarran pioneered the use of CUTE in the domestic terminals of American airports. In 2003, it became the first airport in the country to install common-use self-service kiosks, which customers use to check in and obtain their boarding passes. With nearly 30 carriers serving McCarran, officials did not want to have separate sets of kiosks for each one. The airport ultimately acquired a reputation in the United States as the model for the common-use approach. It began implementing a baggage-tracking system based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) in 2005. The technology was intended to facilitate luggage screening and decrease the chances of losing bags. McCarran and the Hong Kong airport were the first to use RFID on a large scale.

In the 2000s, Allegiant Air moved its headquarters from Fresno to Las Vegas. The company also changed its focus to providing nonstop flights between small towns and vacation destinations and expanded the number of cities it served from McCarran to 35. In 2004, Philippine Airlines extended its flight between Manila and Vancouver to Las Vegas. The service was primarily targeted at tourists from western Canada, though the carrier also hoped to attract members of the large Filipino community in Las Vegas. The third wing of Concourse D, along with a ramp control tower, opened in April 2005. Two years later, a consolidated rental car facility began operations. The fourth and final wing of Concourse D was added in September 2008. In the same month, US Airways closed the night hub due to the 2000s energy crisis. The airline had merged with America West in 2005. US Airways shut its crew base at McCarran in 2010. By 2012, the company had eliminated all routes except for those to its hubs in Charlotte, Philadelphia, and Phoenix and its focus city at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C.Fearing McCarran would soon exceed its capacity, the Clark County Commission began work on Terminal 3 in 2005. The economy was doing well, and Terminal 2 had become congested. Although the economy later entered a recession, the county chose to proceed with the project. The airport&#x27;s cargo facility was located within the Terminal 3 site, so it was replaced by the Marnell Air Cargo Center, which opened in 2010. The new terminal was inaugurated in June 2012, replacing Terminal 2. It cost $2.4 billion and was the largest public works project in Nevada. In 2013, Philippine Airlines discontinued its route to Las Vegas. In 2016, Terminal 2 was demolished, and a new control tower and Terminal Radar Approach Control facility were completed. At tall, it was the second tallest in the country when completed. In 2017, the airport equipped seven gates in Concourse D to receive international flights and built a tunnel to connect them to the customs facility in Terminal 3. LATAM Airlines Brasil added a seasonal route to São Paulo, McCarran&#x27;s first direct link to South America, in June 2018.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the control tower was closed for several days after a controller tested positive for the virus, leading to many delays and cancellations. The following month, the decrease in traffic caused by the pandemic prompted the closure of all the gates in Concourse B and Terminal 3. Concourse B reopened in the summer, and the E gates in Terminal 3 subsequently reopened in July 2021. 

In February 2021, the Clark County Commission voted unanimously to rename the airport after U.S. senator Harry Reid of Nevada. The commissioners believed that Pat McCarran had left a legacy of anti-Semitism and racism. The airport was officially renamed in December 2021.

==Facilities==

Harry Reid International Airport has four runways:
*1L/19R: 
*1R/19L: 
*8L/26R: 
*8R/26L: 

The runways are made of concrete. 1L, 26R, and 26L have a category I instrument landing system with distance measuring equipment. 8L/26R is the third-longest civil runway in the country.

The airport has a total of 110 gates across two passenger terminals, which are numbered 1 and 3, and a satellite concourse called Concourse D. Terminal 1 contains three concourses labeled A, B, and C. Terminal 3 houses the E gates and handles international arrivals. Terminal 3 and Concourse D are able to receive international flights, and a tunnel links the international gates in Concourse D to the customs checkpoint. Of these international gates, Concourse D has a 3-jetway stand (D21/22) that can accommodate an Airbus A380, the largest commercial airplane in the world. There is an airside tram system with three lines. The green and blue lines connect the central part of Terminal 1 with Concourses C and D, respectively. The red line runs between Terminal 3 and Concourse D.

In 1968, slot machines were first installed at the airport. The Las Vegas and Reno airports are the only two airports in the United States with slot machines. Terminal 1 and Concourse D also house exhibits of the Howard W. Cannon Aviation Museum, which covers the history of aviation in southern Nevada.

Airlines unload their freight at the Marnell Air Cargo Center, which can handle of cargo. Janet Air flights to secret military installations operate from a dedicated terminal building. The airport also has a parking lot where the public can watch aircraft take off and land.

Maverick Helicopters and Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters each operate their own terminal at Harry Reid Airport for sightseeing flights. The Maverick terminal covers , and the Sundance terminal occupies . The Papillon terminal was established in 1997.

‡Final adjusted passenger data for 2023.

*From 1970 to the end of 2024, 1,538,394,375 passengers (enplaned+deplaned) have passed through Harry Reid Int&#x27;l Airport, an annual average of 27,970,807 passengers per year.

==Ground transportation==
Vehicles reach the airport via Paradise Road and Russell Road from the north and via the Harry Reid Airport Connector, which branches off from the Las Vegas Beltway, from the south. A 5,000-space consolidated rental car facility is located away and is linked to the terminals by shuttle buses. Buses also shuttle passengers between Terminals 1 and 3. The Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada&#x27;s public bus system serves the airport. The airport is the busiest in the world without an airport rail link.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On November 15, 1956, Trans World Airlines Flight 163, a Martin 4-0-4, crash-landed at then McCarran Field during an attempted single-engine go-around after takeoff returning to the airport. Out of 38 passengers and crew, 16 received minor injuries. There was no fire, but the aircraft was destroyed. 
* On the evening of November 15, 1964, Bonanza Air Lines Flight 114, a Fairchild F-27 turboprop flying from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport to McCarran International Airport, crashed into the top of a hill in desert country about SSW of Las Vegas in poor weather conditions, all 26 passengers and three crew perished. The probable cause was the misreading of a faulty, outdated approach chart by the captain which resulted in a premature descent before impacting terrain.
* On April 16, 1965, a Bonanza Air Lines Fairchild F-27 on a training flight, cartwheeled off the runway at LAS because of an asymmetrical flap condition on takeoff. Both occupants survived, but the aircraft was substantially damaged and was written off.
* On December 9, 1968, a Lockheed L-1649 Starliner operated by &quot;Fly By Night Safaris&quot; crashed back onto the runway at LAS during takeoff when a partial loss of power forced the pilot to carry out a belly landing. Parts of the propellers broke off as they contacted the runway, puncturing the fuselage. There were no fatalities among the 104 passengers and crew on board, but the aircraft was destroyed.
* On October 24, 1978, a Learjet 24 operated by &quot;Qualitron Aero Services Inc.&quot; crashed at LAS because of a premature rotation when one engine was cut after V1 speed after takeoff. Both occupants survived, but the aircraft was substantially damaged and written off.
* On August 17, 1999, a British Aerospace 125 operated by &quot; DP Air&quot; was severely damaged after it was forced to land at LAS with the landing gear retracted because of a loss of its hydraulic systems to extend the gear. All eight occupants survived with no injuries, but the aircraft was destroyed.
* On September 8, 2015, British Airways Flight 2276, a Boeing 777-200 destined for Gatwick Airport, suffered an uncontained left engine failure during the takeoff roll because of a cracked compressor disk, and the pilots aborted takeoff. A fire broke out in the affected engine after the aircraft stopped, and an evacuation of all 170 passengers and crew was performed on the runway. There was one serious injury and 19 minor injuries during the evacuation. The aircraft was severely damaged by the engine fire, but the plane was repaired and later placed back into service.
* On Saturday, October 5, 2024, a Frontier Airlines Airbus A321 operating as Flight 1326 from San Diego, caught fire while landing. The pilots declared an emergency and the flight landed without injuries to its 197 occupants.

==In popular culture==
Harry Reid International Airport - under its former name, McCarran International Airport - appears in the 2010 videogame &quot;&quot;. In game, it is often referred to as Camp McCarran, due to the presence of New California Republic troops using it as a military base.

Additionally, the airport appears at the end of the 1988 film &quot;Midnight Run&quot;.

<doc id="262542" wikidata="Q1430913" url="?curid=262542" title="Austin–Bergstrom International Airport">
<text>Austin–Bergstrom International Airport, or ABIA , is an international airport in Austin, Texas, United States, serving the Greater Austin metropolitan area. Located about southeast of downtown Austin, it covers and has two runways and three helipads.

The airport lies on the site of what was Bergstrom Air Force Base, named after Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, an officer who was the first person from Austin to be killed in World War II. The base was decommissioned in the early 1990s, and the land reverted to the city, which used it to replace Robert Mueller Municipal Airport as Austin&#x27;s main airport in 1999. The airport is the third busiest in Texas, after Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston–Intercontinental, as well as the 27th busiest airport in the United States by passenger traffic. , there are more than 550 arrivals and departures on a typical weekday to 97 destinations in North America and Europe.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===

In 1942, the city of Austin purchased land and donated the land to the Federal government of the United States for a military installation, with the stipulation that the city would get the land back when the government no longer needed it. This land became Del Valle Army Air Base, or Del Valle Airfield. Del Valle Airfield was activated on September 19, 1942, on leased from the City of Austin. The name of the base was changed to Bergstrom Army Airfield (AAF) in March 1943 in honor of Captain John August Earl Bergstrom, a reservist in the 19th Bombardment Group, who was killed at Clark Field, Philippines in 1941. He was the first Austinite killed in World War II. With the separation of the United States Air Force and United States Army in September 1947, the name again changed to Bergstrom Air Force Base. It would have this name until it was decommissioned in the early 1990s, with all military aviation ceasing in 1995 after more than 50 years.

As Austin was quickly outgrowing the old Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, the city began considering options for a new airport as early as 1971, when the Federal Aviation Administration proposed that Austin and San Antonio build a joint regional airport. That idea was rejected, as few Austinites supported driving halfway to San Antonio on Interstate 35 to catch a flight. Afterwards, the city submitted a proposal to the United States Air Force for joint use of Bergstrom Air Force Base in 1976. The Air Force rejected the proposal in 1978 as being too disruptive to its operations.

In the 1980s, neighborhoods around Mueller applied enough political pressure to force the city council to choose a site for a new airport from locations under consideration. In November 1987, voters approved a referendum designating a site near Manor. The city began acquiring the land but faced lawsuits from the Sierra Club and others concerned about the Manor location and its potential environmental impact.

The plans to construct a new airport at the Manor location were abandoned in 1991 when the Base Realignment and Closure Commission selected Bergstrom for closure, and gave the nod to the city for the land and runways to be converted for use as a civilian airport. The city council decided to abandon the original plan to build the new airport near Manor, and resolved instead to move the airport to the Bergstrom site. The City of Austin hired John Almond—a civil engineer who had recently led the airport design team for the new airport expansion in San Jose, California—as Project Director for the new $585 million airport in Austin and to put together a team of engineers and contractors to accomplish the task. The issue of a $400 million bond referendum for a new airport owned and operated by the city was put to a public vote in May 1993 with a campaign managed by local public affairs consultant Don Martin and then-Mayor Bruce Todd and was approved by 63% of the vote. Groundbreaking for the new airport began in November 1994.

On October 23, 1995, with a $10 million budget and after the old tower, previously used by the US Air Force, was demolished, construction began on building Austin&#x27;s tallest primary building () that houses air traffic controllers. The new tower, completed a year before then-current president Bill Clinton arrived with his entourage, enabled Air Force One to be granted clearance to land. This made the president the &quot;first passenger&quot; to arrive at the new airport.

The main Air Force runway, 17R/35L, was retained along with most of its taxiways, as its high weight rating and long length would facilitate service by large long-range airliners while reducing construction costs. Bergstom&#x27;s original secondary runway, 17L/35R, was closed and partially demolished to accommodate new taxiway sections directly connecting 17R/35L to the new terminal. The remnants of the former runway are used as a service road and a parking area for a Boeing 727 used for emergency training. A replacement runway 17L/35R was built east of the terminal, along with a general aviation complex on the southern side of the airport. Most former military buildings, including the original control tower, were demolished and cleared to make way for the new terminal and parking facilities, although some hangars and parking tarmac to the south was retained, along with a section of tarmac to the northeast of the primary runway that became the foundation for the airport&#x27;s freight terminal. Some existing bridges were converted for ground vehicle access-road use. Military housing in the northwest portion of the former base was leveled, but some of its roads now serve a Texas Department of Transportation service facility. Several Travis County facilities near the airfield, including the county correctional facility and sheriff&#x27;s training academy, were unaffected by the conversion project.

Bergstrom had the location identifier of BSM until Mueller&#x27;s final closure in 1999 when it took Mueller&#x27;s IATA code of AUS. Initial issues with flight scheduling and routing led to proposed plans to keep Mueller operating in parallel with Bergstrom for a few weeks, but residents near Mueller blocked such efforts by appealing to the FAA, who refused to delay the transfer of the AUS identifier or to issue a new airport code for Mueller. Austin–Bergstrom opened to the public on May 23, 1999.

=== Opening ===
Austin–Bergstrom International Airport opened to the public on May 23, 1999, with a runway, among the nation&#x27;s longest commercial runways. The Barbara Jordan passenger terminal was originally conceived as an 18-gate terminal facility with a footprint of a bit more than . ABIA was expanded during construction to have 24 contact gates with jet bridges (named Gate 2-Gate 25) and one gate without a jet bridge (named Gate 1) for a total footprint of 660,000 sq ft.

The opening of the airport coincided with a considerable number of nonstop flights being operated into Austin from the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, as American Airlines had decided to compete with Southwest Airlines&#x27; scheduled service between Dallas Love Field (DAL) and Austin in addition to American and Delta Air Lines service between Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and AUS. At the time, there were 42 nonstop flights every weekday being operated with mainline jet aircraft from the two primary airports located in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex to Austin. By contrast, this same OAG lists a combined total of 24 nonstop flights every weekday at this time from the two primary airports serving the Houston area, William P. Hobby Airport (HOU) and George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH), to Austin.

=== Recent history ===
As the population and economic importance of Austin has grown in recent years, airlines have been introducing new nonstop flights to the airport instead of routing passengers through existing hubs in Dallas and Houston, causing dramatic growth in both passenger numbers and nonstop service at Austin–Bergstrom. In March 2014, British Airways inaugurated a flight to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport. This was the airport&#x27;s first scheduled transatlantic service.

The terminal&#x27;s first expansion project was completed in the summer of 2015. It added an enlarged customs and immigration facility on the arrivals level capable of processing more than 600 passengers per hour, two domestic baggage claim belts, and an enlarged security checkpoint on the ticketing level. In 2019, a $350 million addition to the east side of the terminal added nine new gates, increasing the total number of gates from 25 to 34. These gates are spaced farther apart, to accommodate additional flights operated by larger aircraft. Gates 1+3 and Gates 2+4 are able to act independently of each other when accommodating narrow body aircraft, or as one gate&#x27;s Door A and Door B in a dual jet-bridge configuration when larger, wide-body aircraft arrive providing boarding options. The number of flexible-use gates that can accommodate both international and domestic flights increased from two to six.

To accommodate the airport&#x27;s rapid growth, a three-gate South Terminal opened on April 13, 2017. The terminal was built at a cost of US$12 million by a private company, LoneStar Airport Holdings, under a 40-year lease. The terminal reused a building from the Bergstrom Air Force Base, adding outdoor waiting areas and a food-truck retail area. The gates are hardstands, without jet bridges, and are used exclusively by ultra-low-cost carriers Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines. The South Terminal is scheduled to be demolished as part of the forthcoming airport expansion, which led to a lawsuit from its operator, LoneStar Airport Holdings. The company says the airport is violating the 40-year lease agreement it signed in 2016 and said that it had invested about $50 million in building and operating the terminal. In 2023, a court agreed with LoneStar, and the airport agreed to a settlement, paying $88 million to break the lease.

=== Future ===
Austin-Bergstrom is currently undergoing a major expansion program, entitled &quot;Journey With AUS&quot;, to accommodate the rapid growth in travel demand. Chief amongst the expansion plans are two projects; the first being the construction of a new arrivals and departures hall that will consolidate all ticketing, security screening and baggage claims under one roof. The second being the construction of Concourse B that will include 20 gates initially, and could be expanded up to 40 in the future. Concourse B will be connected to the existing Barbara Jordan Terminal (to be renamed Concourse A) via an underground tunnel, and the tunnel will be capable of expanding to a future Concourse C.

== Facilities ==
=== Terminal ===
The Barbara Jordan Terminal is the airport&#x27;s main terminal and has a total of 34 gates, six of which are capable of handling international flights. There are several restaurants and food concessions inside the terminal, all but two of which are located inside the secured gate areas of the terminal. The terminal also has a live music stage on which local bands perform in keeping with the spirit of Austin&#x27;s proclamation as &quot;The Live Music Capital of the World&quot;.

A secondary terminal with three gates known as the South Terminal is used by ultra low-cost carriers Allegiant Air and Frontier Airlines. The South Terminal is accessed from a separate entrance on the south side of the airport perimeter from Burleson Road; it cannot be accessed from either the main airport entrance from SH 71 or the Barbara Jordan terminal except by completely exiting the airport grounds. A shuttle bus runs between the two terminals and the trip between the terminals takes between 15 and 20 minutes. The facility has a retro look and passenger gates are not equipped with jet bridges; passengers walk under a covered walkway to board the aircraft by stairs.

=== Ground transportation ===

Route 20, operated by the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority, operates from the arrivals level of the Barbara Jordan Terminal every 15 minutes. The route takes passengers through the East Riverside Corridor to Downtown and University of Texas at Austin before heading east along Manor Road.

Through the Project Connect plan, the airport is planned be the southern terminus of the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority Blue Line light rail, which will run through the East Riverside Corridor to Downtown Austin and The University of Texas at Austin as far north as North Lamar/US183. Blue Line construction costs are estimated at $1.3 billion and may be completed as early as 2029. The project (Proposition A) was approved by voters on November 3, 2020.

The airport offers a consolidated rent-a-car center (ConRAC) in a parking garage northeast of the Barbara Jordan Terminal and connected to the Red Garage. Ten rental car companies have passenger service counters on the second floor of the ConRAC, which can service up to 5,000 vehicles per day. The facility opened in October 2015 and was built at a cost of US$162 million. A shuttle bus travels between the South Terminal and the ConRAC.

Part of the ConRAC&#x27;s ground floor serves as a &quot;Ground Transportation Center&quot; providing passengers access to taxis and ridesharing companies including Uber and Lyft.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* March 1, 2002: During an instrument landing system (ILS) approach in bad weather, a Beechcraft A36 Bonanza, registration number &quot;N7236L&quot;, crashed on airport grounds and burned out after the pilot initiated a missed approach. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot and single passenger were killed. The accident was attributed to &quot;The pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain airspeed, resulting in a stall. Contributing factors were the low ceiling, fog, and the unforecast weather conditions.&quot;
* December 7, 2009: A Piper PA-46-500TP, registration number &quot;N600YE&quot;, impacted terrain near Mendoza, Texas, in a steep descending right turn during an ILS approach in low visibility, substantially damaging the aircraft and killing the pilot and single passenger. Immediately prior to the crash, an air traffic controller had instructed the pilot to perform a &quot;combination of descending turns&quot; and &quot;heading changes [that] were rapid [and] of large magnitude...&quot; Additionally, post-crash toxicological tests of the pilot found evidence of diphenhydramine, a sedating antihistamine. The accident was attributed to &quot;The pilot&#x27;s spatial disorientation, which resulted in his loss of airplane control. Contributing to the pilot&#x27;s spatial disorientation was the sequence and timing of the instructions issued by the air traffic controller. The pilot&#x27;s operation of the airplane after using impairing medication may also have contributed.&quot;
*May 7, 2020: An adult male pedestrian trespassed on the airport&#x27;s runway 17R and was hit and killed by Flight 1392, a Boeing 737-700 operated by Southwest Airlines, as it landed. There were no injuries to passengers or crew, but the plane sustained damage to its left engine nacelle. The victim was not authorized to be on the runway at the time.
*February 4, 2023: FedEx Flight 1432 was attempting to land on runway 18L but had to abort and go around when Southwest Airlines Flight 708 was cleared for departure on the same runway and had already begun its takeoff roll. A subsequent tweet from the NTSB described the incident as a &quot;possible runway incursion and overflight involving airplanes from Southwest Airlines and FedEx.&quot; The planes were barely 150 feet apart.
