<text>Narcotics Anonymous (NA), founded in 1953, describes itself as a &quot;nonprofit fellowship or society of men and women for whom drugs had become a major problem.&quot; Narcotics Anonymous uses a 12-step model developed for people with varied substance use disorders and is the second-largest 12-step organization, after 12-step pioneer Alcoholics Anonymous.

 there were more than 70,000 NA meetings in 144 countries.

==Narcotics Anonymous program ==

===Membership and organization===
The third tradition of NA states that the only requirement for membership is &quot;a desire to stop using.&quot; NA says its meetings are where members can &quot;meet regularly to help each other stay clean.&quot; All facts and quotes presented in &quot;The Narcotics Anonymous program&quot; section, unless otherwise sourced, come from the &quot;Narcotics Anonymous (Basic Text)&quot;. Membership in NA is free, and there are no dues or fees.

The foundation of the Narcotics Anonymous program is the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions. Narcotics Anonymous uses a slight variation of wording in both the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions when compared to other Twelve Step groups.

According to the Basic Text, Narcotics Anonymous &quot;has no opinion on outside issues,&quot; including those of politics, science or medicine, and does not endorse any outside organization or institution. The fellowship does not promote itself, but rather attracts new members through public information and outreach. Individuals can also be compelled to attend by courts or rehab programs. NA groups and areas supply outside organizations with factual information regarding the NA program, and individual members may carry the NA message to hospitals and institutions, such as treatment centers and jails.

===The nature of addiction===
According to the philosophy of the NA program, most addicts did not realize they had a problem with drugs until they had no other choice besides ending up dead or in jail. Even if other people pointed out they may have a drug problem they were convinced otherwise. But once an addict on his or her own tries to stop and realizes they cannot, they finally see that drugs have been controlling them. Addicts &quot;lived to use and used to live&quot;. NA helps show them a different way of life and helps them fight their disease. NA describes as a progressive disease with no known cure, which affects every area of an addict&#x27;s life: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. NA suggests that the disease of addiction can be arrested, and recovery is possible through the NA twelve-step program. The steps never mention drugs or drug use, rather they refer only to addiction, to indicate that addicts have a disease of which drug use is one symptom. In the NA program, all drugs are considered equal, and alcohol is also a drug. Other symptoms include obsession, compulsion, denial, and self-centeredness.

==Meetings==
Regular meetings, hosted by NA groups, are the basic unit of the NA fellowship. Meetings are held in a variety of places such as church meeting rooms, libraries, hospitals, community centers, parks, or any other place that can accommodate a meeting.

Members who attend the same meeting regularly to establish a recovery network and reliable routine understand this to be their &quot;home group.&quot; Home-group members can participate in the group&#x27;s business and play an important role in deciding how the group&#x27;s meetings should be conducted.

===Formats===
There are two basic types of meetings: &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed.&quot; Anyone is welcome to attend an open meeting, while closed meetings are limited to addicts and to people who think they may have a problem with drugs.

Meeting formats vary, but often include time devoted to the reading aloud of NA literature regarding the issues involved in living life clean which is written by and for members of NA. Many meetings are conducted by the chairperson who chooses the speakers. Other meetings include an &quot;open sharing&quot; component, during which anyone attending has the opportunity to share. There is usually no direct feedback during the &quot;share&quot;; thus only one person ever speaks at any given time during this portion of the meeting. These types of meetings are sometimes described as discussion meetings. Some groups choose to host a single speaker (such meetings are usually denoted &quot;speaker meetings&quot;) to share for the majority of the meeting time.

Other meeting formats include round-robin (sharing goes around in a circle), tag meeting (each speaker picks the next person to share), and stick meetings (each member draws a stick with a topic to share on). Some meetings focus on reading, writing, and/or sharing about one of the Twelve Steps or some other portion of NA literature. Some meetings are &quot;common needs&quot; (also known as special-interest) meetings, supporting a particular group of people based on gender, sexual identity, age, language, or another characteristic. These meetings are not exclusionary, as any addict is welcome at any NA meeting. NA communities will often make an effort to have a separate meeting run at the same time for members who do not identify with the common-needs meeting.

During the meeting, some groups allot time for NA-related announcements and many meetings set aside time to recognize clean-time &quot;anniversaries&quot; or &quot;birthdays.&quot; Individuals are sometimes allowed to announce their clean time to the group. Key tags and medallions, which denote various amounts of clean time, are distributed to those who have achieved various milestones. In some areas, the addict who is celebrating a &quot;clean-time anniversary&quot; will be able to have support group members read the readings for the meeting and he or she will have a speaker carry the NA message. Then the addict celebrating will have their sponsor or a friend or family member give them a medallion at which time the friend will share some of the celebrating addict&#x27;s achievements during the last year or from during the entire course of their recovery. Then the addict celebrating can share their experience, strength, and hope (ESH) with the group on how they did it.

NA states in the fifth tradition that &quot;each group has but one primary purpose to carry the message to the addict who still suffers.&quot; Therefore, the newcomer is considered to be the most important person in any meeting. Our message is hope and the promise is freedom. The NA message, as quoted in the Basic Text, states, &quot;an addict, any addict, can stop using drugs, lose the desire to use, and find a new way to live&quot; (Basic Text p. 68). &quot;NA offers one promise: freedom from active addiction&quot; (Basic Text p. 106). According to the Narcotics Anonymous Basic Text, the &quot;Twelve Steps&quot; are the source of this hope and freedom when worked to the best of one&#x27;s ability.

==Service==
NA literature suggests that service work is an essential part of a program of recovery. Service is &quot;doing the right thing for the right reason,&quot; and is the best example of &quot;goodwill,&quot; which is the basis for the freedom only from active addiction by the NA program. Service work is usually chairing a meeting, but may be as simple as cleaning up after the meeting, putting away chairs, or answering a phone. Additionally, there are basic, formalized service positions at the group level to help the group perform its function, such as treasurer, secretary, and Group Service Representative (GSR), who represents the group in the larger service structure.

The NA service structure operates at the area, regional, and world levels. These levels of service exist to serve the groups and are directly responsible to those groups; they do not govern. World services are accountable to its member regions, who are in turn responsible to member areas. Area service committees directly support member groups and often put on special events, such as dances and picnics. Area service committees also provide special subcommittees to serve the needs of members who may be confined in jails and institutions, and will also provide a public interface to the fellowship.

==Literature==
* The Basic Text called &quot;Narcotics Anonymous&quot; is divided into two books. Book one discusses the basics of the NA program and the twelve steps and traditions. Book two is composed of many personal stories.
* &quot;It Works: How and Why&quot; offers detailed discussion of the twelve steps and traditions. and is often called the &quot;green and gold&quot; after its cover. 
* The &quot;Step Working Guides&quot; is a workbook with questions on each step and is often called the &quot;Flat Book&quot;.
* &quot;Just For Today&quot; is a book of daily meditations with quotes from the Basic Text and other NA-approved literature including the &quot;Information Pamphlets&quot;.
* &quot;Sponsorship&quot; is an in-depth discussion of the role of sponsorship in NA, including the personal experiences of members.
* &quot;Miracles Happen&quot; describes the early years of the NA organization. This book contains many photographs of early literature and meeting places.
* &quot;Living Clean: The Journey Continues&quot; was approved by the World Service Conference in May 2012. It contains members&#x27; experiences of staying clean and in recovery as they go through challenges in life such as illness, death, parenthood, spiritual paths, and employment.
*&quot;Guiding Principles; The Spirit of Our Traditions&quot; was approved by the World Service Conference in May 2016. The book explores the principles found in the 12 Traditions of NA and is a resource for members of NA to learn what the essence of the Traditions are, as well as understanding their application for NA groups, members, and service committees.

NA has also produced dozens of &quot;Informational Pamphlets,&quot; or &quot;IPs,&quot; of varying length that cover a wide range of recovery-related topics, including questionnaires for those who think they may have a drug addiction and information for those addicts trying to stay clean while still inside hospitals or institutions.

==Spirituality==
NA calls itself a spiritual program of recovery from the disease of addiction. The NA program places importance on developing a working relationship with a &quot;higher power&quot;. The literature suggests that members formulate their own personal understanding of a higher power. The only suggested guidelines are that this power is &quot;loving, caring, and greater than one&#x27;s self and more powerful than the disease of addiction&quot;.

Members are given absolute freedom in coming to an understanding of a higher power that works for them. Individuals from various spiritual and religious backgrounds, as well as many atheists and agnostics, have developed a relationship with their own higher power. NA also makes frequent use of the word &quot;God&quot; and some members who have difficulty with this term substitute &quot;higher power&quot; or read it as an acronym for &quot;Good Orderly Direction&quot;. Narcotics Anonymous is a spiritual, not religious program.

The twelve steps of the NA program are based upon spiritual principles, three of which are honesty, open-mindedness, and willingness, embodied in the first three steps. These three are hardly exhaustive. The Basic Text of NA says, in Chapter Four, about all twelve steps, &quot;These are the principles which made our recovery possible&quot;. According to NA members these principles, when followed to the best of one&#x27;s ability, allow for a new way of life.

NA meetings usually close with a circle of the participants, a group hug, and a prayer of some sort. Prayers used to close meetings today include the &quot;we&quot; version of the &quot;Serenity Prayer&quot; (&quot;God, Grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference.&quot;); the &quot;Third Step Prayer&quot; (&quot;Take my will and my life. Guide me in my recovery. Show me how to live.&quot;) or the &quot;Gratitude Prayer&quot; (&quot;That no addict seeking recovery need ever die. ... My Gratitude speaks when I care and when I share with others the NA way.&quot;)

==Sponsorship==
One addict helping another is an essential part of the NA program. It is therefore highly recommended that NA members find a sponsor. A sponsor is a member of NA who helps another member of the fellowship by sharing their experience, strength, and hope in recovery and serves as a guide through the Twelve Steps. In doing so, NA members often choose a sponsor with experience in applying the NA&#x27;s Twelve Steps.

To feel most comfortable, many NA members have sponsors of the same sex although members are free to choose any other member as a sponsor. It is also suggested that one should find a sponsor who has worked all 12 steps of Narcotics Anonymous.

==Anonymity==
&quot;Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.&quot; (12th Tradition, Basic Text)

Many NA members identify themselves in meetings by their first name only. The spirit of anonymity is about placing &quot;principles before personalities&quot; and recognizing that no individual addict is superior to another and that individual addicts do not recover without the fellowship or its spiritual principles.

The Eleventh Tradition states that NA members &quot;need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, and films&quot;.

==History==
NA sprang from the Alcoholics Anonymous Program of the mid-1930s, and was founded by Jimmy Kinnon. Meetings first emerged in Los Angeles in the early 1950s. The NA program, officially founded in 1953, started as a small US-based movement that has grown into the world&#x27;s largest 12 step recovery program for drug addiction.

===Predecessors===
Alcoholics Anonymous was the first 12-step program, and through it many with drug and drinking problems found sobriety. The Fourth Tradition gives each AA group the autonomy to include or exclude non-alcoholic addicts from &quot;closed&quot; meetings where only those with an expressed desire to quit drinking may attend. At &quot;open&quot; AA meetings, non-alcoholics are welcome.

In 1944, AA&#x27;s co-founder Bill Wilson discussed a separate fellowship for drug addicts. In 1947, NARCO (also called Addicts Anonymous) met weekly at the U.S. Public Health Service&#x27;s treatment center (Federal Medical Center, Lexington) inside the Lexington, Kentucky federal prison for 20 years. In 1948, a NARCO member started a short-lived fellowship also called &quot;Narcotics Anonymous&quot; in the New York Prison System in New York City, New York. This version of NA did not follow the 12 Traditions of NA, which resulted in problems for the fellowship and ultimately the end of that NA in the late 1940s. Jimmy K., who is credited with starting the NA as we know it today, did contact Rae Perez, a leading member of this NA fellowship. Because that fellowship did not want to follow the 12 traditions written by AA, the two NA fellowships never united.

===Early history of NA===
In 1953, Narcotics Anonymous was founded by Jimmy Kinnon and others. Differing from its predecessors, NA formed a fellowship of mutually supporting groups. Founding members, most of whom were from AA, debated and established the 12 Traditions of the NA fellowship. On September 14, 1953, AA authorized NA the use of AA&#x27;s 12 steps and traditions on the condition that they stop using the AA name, causing the organization to call itself Narcotics Anonymous.

In 1954, the first NA publication was printed, called the &quot;Little Brown Book&quot;. It contained the 12 steps and early drafts of several pieces that would later be included in subsequent literature.

At that time, NA was not yet recognized by society at large as a positive force. The initial group had difficulty finding places that would allow them to meet and often had to meet in people&#x27;s homes. The first meetings of Narcotics Anonymous were held in the basements of churches for the members&#x27; protection because at that time a law prohibiting convicted felons from congregating was still being upheld and churches offered their basements as a sanctuary. Addicts would have to cruise around meeting places and check for surveillance, to make sure meetings would not be busted by police. It was many years before NA became recognized as a beneficial organization, although some early press accounts were very positive.

In addition, many NA groups were not following the 12 traditions very closely (which were quite new at the time). These groups were at times accepting money from outside entities, conflating AA with NA, or even adding religious elements to the meetings. For a variety of reasons, meetings began to decline in the late 1950s, and there was a four-month period in 1959 when there were no meetings held anywhere at all. Spurred into action by this, Kinnon and others dedicated themselves to restarting NA, promising to hold to the traditions more closely.

===Resurgence===
In late 1959, meetings began to form again and grow. The NA White Booklet was written in 1962 and became the heart of NA meetings and the basis for all subsequent NA literature. NA was called a &quot;hip pocket program&quot; because the entire literature could fit into a person&#x27;s hip pocket. This booklet was republished in 1966 as the NA White Book and included the personal stories of many addicts.

The first NA phone line started in 1960, and the first &quot;H&amp;I&quot; group was formed in 1963 (H&amp;I stands for Hospitals and Institutions, a sub-committee of Narcotics Anonymous that carries the message into hospitals and institutions where people cannot get to an outside meeting). That year a &quot;Parent Service Board&quot; (later renamed the World Service Board) was formed to ensure that NA stayed healthy and followed closely to the traditions. Confusingly, in 1962, the Salvation Army started a group also called &quot;Narcotics Anonymous&quot; that followed a different &quot;13-step&quot; program, but this program soon died out. The NA program grew slowly in the 1960s. Members of the program learned what was effective and what was not. Relapse rates declined over time and friction between NA groups began to decrease.

The 1970s was a period of rapid growth in NA&#x27;s history. In 1970, there were only 20 regular, weekly meetings, all of them in the United States. Within two years there were 70, including meetings in Germany, Australia, and Bermuda. By 1976, there were 200 regular meetings, including 83 in California alone, and in the early 1980s in Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, the Republic of Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. In 1980, the first London meeting opened in Millman Street, Chelsea, with around six members and a second followed months later. By 1981, there were 1,100 different meetings all over the world and in 1983 Mary Bolton founded &quot;Narcotics Anonymous in Ireland&quot;. A World Service Office was officially opened in 1977. In 1971, the first NA World Conference was held, and others have followed annually.

===The development of NA literature===
From the beginnings of NA, the need for official NA literature was evident. Unfortunately, the process of creating and approving official NA literature has seen some of the most contentious periods of debate within the fellowship. Although the Yellow Booklet, Little White Booklet, and Little White Book were used in the 1960s and 1970s, many people desired to have a more detailed book on recovery, paralleling the &quot;Big Book&quot; of Alcoholics Anonymous. Some meetings offered AA literature at meetings, while others considered writing their own books on recovery. One group even planned to print a bootlegged version of AA&#x27;s Big Book with every instance of the word &quot;alcohol&quot; replaced with &quot;drugs&quot;. The need for a unified text approved by the fellowship&#x27;s &quot;group conscience&quot; was recognized, and in October 1979 the first NA World Literature Conference was held in Wichita, Kansas.

While previous literature had been written by just a few addicts (primarily by Jimmy Kinnon), the NA Basic Text was written as a massive collaboration between hundreds of people. There were a total of seven World Literature Conferences within three years, all of them open to any addict who wished to help. It was decided that the book would use the Little White Book as its outline, filling in and expanding on the subjects discussed in that text.

In November 1981, a finalized version was distributed to all of NA for approval, and the text was approved with a 2/3 majority required for passage. After passage, however, the publication was held up due to a spirited disagreement between the World Service Office and the members who wrote the book regarding a few key sentences which described the nature of the World Service Organization and other NA service entities. The book was printed in 1983 with the passages removed. A second edition that restored the passages quickly followed at the demand of the fellowship. A hasty vote which required Regional Service Representatives to respond within 60 days (even though most regions only met every 90 days) making it impossible to actually poll the NA Groups and membership again removed the sentences in a third edition.

Professional editors and writers were hired in 1986 to improve the Basic Text so that it was more consistent in tone and style. The resultant 4th edition, released in 1987, was improperly reviewed and had many problems, including 30 lines that were missing and text that was inconsistent with other NA literature. A 5th edition was released in 1988, purportedly correcting those problems.

In 2004, the WSC initiated a project to revise the Basic Text. This new edition would remove some of the personal stories from the 5th edition, and supplement the remainder of the original stories with more diverse personal stories from around the world. The first 10 chapters were to remain the same. Also, the preface would remain the same, as well as the &quot;Symbol&quot; page. There is a new preface but the original preface will be called &quot;preface to the 1st edition&quot;. There were some other changes to the structure of the book, including the layout and flow of the book, while keeping the original message clear and unchanged. The task of choosing these stories was handed down from the World Service Office to regional meetings, to Area Service Committee meetings, and then to the individual home group meetings, where each member had a chance to review the new text.

When the Approval Draft came out on September 1, 2006, 7,500 copies were distributed (4,493 copies were mailed and 3,009 copies were electronic copies downloaded by members). The approximate number of input received was 350 pieces, of which 60 percent came from individuals, 17 percent came from groups, and 23 percent came from committees. More than 20 percent (161) of the personal stories submitted came from outside of the United States. Submissions were received from the following countries (although later on more personal stories were submitted and the additional statistics are unknown):

* Argentina
* Australia
* Bangladesh
* Belgium
* Brazil
* Canada
* Colombia
* Egypt
* France
* Germany
* Greece
* India
* Iran
* Ireland
* Israel
* Italy
* Japan
* Mexico
* Nepal
* Netherlands
* New Zealand
* Nicaragua
* Norway
* Portugal
* Puerto Rico
* Russia
* Saudi Arabia
* Singapore
* South Africa
* Spain
* Sweden
* Switzerland
* Trinidad
* Turkey
* United Kingdom
* The United States
* Venezuela
* West Indies
The 6th edition of the NA Basic Text was approved with over forty new &quot;personal stories&quot; from around the world. Because of the addition of so many new stories of NA member experiences, it is larger in size than all earlier editions. After the rapid succession of five editions during the 1980s, this was the first new edition in twenty years.

On October 1, 2008, the 5th edition was replaced by the 6th edition in the Narcotics Anonymous World Services inventory at NA.org. Copies of the Basic Text are sold, or given away for free at the group&#x27;s expense, at NA meetings, and are available in over 30 different languages. Millions have been sold worldwide, and have been useful to many addicts.

===More recent history===
The Sixth Edition Basic Text was published in 2008, and there was also a special edition released that same year known as the 25th Anniversary Commemorative (of the First Edition Basic Text) Sixth Edition Basic Text.

In 2003, NA World Services approved a new text entitled &quot;Sponsorship&quot;. This book endeavors to help people explore the concept of NA sponsorship.

In the more recent months, there has been a motion to revise the pamphlet &quot;In Times of Illness&quot;.

A motion for a project to create a new book was put to the World Service Conference in the 2008–2010 conference cycle. The motion was carried by unanimous consent in 2010. over the next two years members of the Narcotics Anonymous fellowship took part in a collective effort to create this new book-length piece of literature. The book was to be titled Living Clean: The Journey Continues. At the 2012 World Service Conference, a motion to approve the final draft of the book was presented to the conference for approval and once again the delegates carried the motion unanimously. Living Clean: The Journey Continues was released to the public in 2012.

Another book, Guiding Principles, was developed during this period.

Most recently in 2022, Narcotics Anonymous published the Spiritual Principal A Day book often shortened to SPAD. This book consists of a short message about a different spiritual principle for each day of the year. This is similar to another book previously published by NA called Just for Today, containing a message for thought on a recovery related topic for each day of the year.

===Membership demographics===
Membership in Narcotics Anonymous is voluntary; no attendance records are kept either for NA&#x27;s own purposes or for others. Because of this, it is sometimes difficult to provide interested parties with comprehensive information about NA membership. There are, however, some objective measures that can be shared based on data obtained from members attending one of NA world conventions; the diversity of membership, especially ethnic background, seems to be representative of the geographic location of the survey. The following demographic information was revealed in a survey returned by almost half of the 13,000 attendees at the 2003 NA World Convention held in San Diego, California:
• Gender: 55% male, 45% female.
• Age: 3% 20 years old and under, 12% 21–30 years old, 31% 31–40 years old, 40% 41–50 years old, 13% over age 51, and 1% did not answer.
• Ethnicity: 51% Caucasian, 24% African-American, 14% Hispanic, and 11% other.
• Employment status: 72% employed full-time, 9% employed part-time, 7% unemployed, 3% retired, 3% homemakers, 5% students, and 1% did not answer.
• Continuous abstinence/recovery: The 2015 Membership Survey showed the range from less than one year up to 54 years, with a mean average of 8.32 years. The 2015 Membership Survey of 22,803 members is available on NA.org, under the &quot;For the Public&quot; tab.

===Rate of growth===
Because no attendance records are kept, it is impossible to estimate what percentages of those who come to Narcotics Anonymous remain active in NA over time. The only sure indicator of the program&#x27;s ability to attract members is the rapid growth in the number of registered Narcotics Anonymous meetings in recent decades and the rapid spread of Narcotics Anonymous outside North America.
* In 1978, there were fewer than 200 registered groups in three countries.
* In 1983, more than a dozen countries had 2,966 meetings.
* In 1993, 60 countries had over 13,000 groups holding over 19,000 meetings.
* In 2002, 108 countries had 20,000 groups holding over 30,000 meetings.
* In 2005, 116 countries had over 21,500 groups holding over 33,500 weekly meetings.
* In 2007, over 25,065 groups were holding over 43,900 weekly meetings in 127 countries.
* In 2012, there were over 62,700 meetings worldwide in over 142 countries.
* In 2018, there were more than 70,000 weekly meetings in 144 countries.

==Organizational structure==
Members meet at NA Groups; Representatives of which participate in Area Service Committees (ASC); Several Area Service Committees form a Regional Service Committee (RSC) and the Regional Delegates (RD) make up NA World Service Committee. The foundation for this structure is the Twelve Traditions of NA and the 12 Concepts for NA Service.

===NA Groups===
Narcotics Anonymous is fundamentally made up of NA Groups. An NA Group is a number of NA members who meet regularly; usually at the same time and place each week. Some Groups have more frequent meetings but are considered to be part of a single Group. Groups have one primary purpose, to carry the message to the addict who still suffers. Groups are largely independent of one another and members of NA are encouraged to choose a &quot;homegroup&quot; to belong to, a group they attend regularly and where they will be missed if they are absent. Each Group elects any number of leaders, or &quot;trusted servants&quot;, to serve the needs of the Group they made include a Group Secretary, a Group Treasurer, a Group Chairperson, a Group Service Representative (GSR), and an alternate GSR. This election process is carried out by the Group Conscience which is a business meeting made up of the members of the Group who strive for consensus-based decisions. With each group being autonomous, without affecting NA as a whole, the responsibilities of trusted servants vary from meeting to meeting. These responsibilities or &quot;group policies&quot; are contrived through the group&#x27;s business meeting by inviting a Higher Power to guide each recovering person&#x27;s decision, also known as a group conscience. An example of one specific trusted servant&#x27;s responsibilities are, &quot;The secretary is responsible for opening the meeting, choosing someone to chair the meeting, making sure coffee gets made, etc. He or she also arranges for purchasing supplies and keeping group records. The treasurer keeps financial records and pays the group&#x27;s bills. The GSR attends the Area Service Committee meetings and represents the group to the ASC. The alternate GSR assists the GSR and prepares to replace the GSR when need be.&quot;

===Area service committees===
An ASC is made up of all the participating NA Groups in a given area. The Group Service Representatives (GSRs) and alternate GSRs from each Group in an Area meet regularly together for a business meeting where issues are raised and discussed to better meet the needs of the groups in the Area. Each ASC elects its own officers: the chairperson, vice-chairperson, secretary, treasurer, and regional committee members (RCMs). Frequently an ASC will have various subcommittees (such as a but not limited to Hospitals and Institutions (H&amp;I), Public Information (PI), Activities, Website, Outreach, Policy, Literature, Literature Review, Newsletter, Recovery By Mail and Convention) which are led by subcommittee leaders that are elected by the entire ASC. In some regions, several ASCs will be grouped into a Metropolitan Service Committee at the sub-regional level; this is typical in especially large cities, like Los Angeles, that contain multiple ASCs.

===Regional service committees===
An RSC is composed of the regional committee members (RCMs) of all the participating ASCs in a region. It is similar in organization to an ASC but is further removed from the day-to-day activities of individual home groups. Many of the issues dealt with by RSCs are the same ones that will come before the World Service Conference, with the RSC being the best way for local groups to help craft policies that will affect NA as a whole. In some cases, only the RCMs in a region will meet to vote on issues; in other situations, all GSRs in a region will be invited to attend an RSC meeting. The RSC elects a delegate to attend the World Service Conference.

===Zonal Forums===
The Zonal Forums are service-oriented organizational structures designed to improve communication between RSCs. They are not decision-making entities.

Some Zonal Forums actively participate in &quot;Fellowship Development&quot; to help NA fellowships grow in new countries and geographic areas where NA is still forming. Zonal Forums help NA groups, areas, or regions to work together to translate literature, inform the local community about NA and create new service committees. This is achieved through annual or biannual Zonal Forum meetings together with development visits to NA groups and members in other countries. Experienced NA members hold workshops, and meetings and present material to help the newer communities.

Zonal forums also provide an important opportunity for World Services and the World Board to interact with newer and growing NA communities to better understand their needs and challenges. Zonal forums are an important part of the growth of NA in some of the most populous and remote parts of the world. Eastern Europe, central and eastern Asia, and Latin America NA communities have grown significantly through the work of Zonal Forums.

Some Zonal Forums are a service-oriented sharing session that provides the means by which NA communities in their zone can communicate, cooperate, and grow with one another. Although not a part of NA&#x27;s formal decision-making system, Zonal Forums interact with World Services in many ways. Each Zonal Forum provides a biannual report on the floor of the World Service Conference and, when requested by the conference, may also answer specific questions or address the body. To improve communications, the Zonal Forums are provided with conference participant mailings and send each Zonal Forum meeting record to World Services. To more effectively serve the fellowship, World Services and the Zonal Forums maintain an ongoing partnership to plan and conduct the Worldwide Workshop system.

===NA World Service Conference===
The NA World Service Conference (WSC) is a triennial service meeting made up of the delegates of the seated Regions and Zones of the world and the members of the NA World Board. This service conference has the executive right to make decisions for the entire NA Fellowship. This includes electing members to serve on the World Board, approving all new NA Literature, service material, and making policy decisions that affect the fellowship including the organizational structure. This responsibility has been executed as recently as the late 1990s when the World Service Conference voted to re-structure the NA Service structure including the removal of the Board of Trustees, Board of Directors, and several other World Service level committees (Public Information, Hospitals &amp; Institutions, Literature, and Translations) replacing them with a single board elected by the conference.

===NA World Service Office===
The WSC through the World Board is responsible for the NA World Service Office located in the Chatsworth, a neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States. This office handles the production of all approved literature, provides resources for projects approved by the WSC, and also provides limited services to the fellowship as a whole. The office also administers the legal responsibilities of the fellowship concerning copyrights, intellectual property, and accounting. The office employs many people who carry out these functions.

===Finances===
Narcotics Anonymous members are not required to pay any dues or fees. NA is committed to being fully self-supporting, declining any outside contributions. Group expenses are covered entirely by voluntary contributions from its members. Groups meet costs such as meeting room rental, tea and coffee, and any literature that the group provides for free from these contributions, after which surplus funds are passed to the service structure. Group often provide some literature items such as IPs (Double sided single sheet pamphlets) and keytags/chips celebrating clean time. Area Service Committees are typically funded from Group contributions plus money raised by events such as dances and recovery events attended by members. In some countries Area committees also supply literature to the Groups. Areas pass funds on to the Regions, which can also receive contributions from Groups and also raise money through conventions attended by hundreds to thousands and tens of thousands of members. Regions also sometimes run Regional Service Offices which buy literature from the World Service Office and its branch offices for sale to Areas and Groups. Because Regional Service Offices can purchase in bulk and sell at list price sometimes this surplus exceeds the running costs of the office. Regions then pass funds to Zonal Forums and also the World Service Conference via the World Service Office according to the decision of the Region.

At the World Service level of Narcotics Anonymous expenses are met partially by the voluntary donations via the service structure and also through the sale of recovery literature. NA does not accept donations from non-members, organizations, or governments. NA recovery literature is produced by the NA World Service Office (NAWS) located in California, USA. Typically NA groups will purchase literature using group funds from local (area or regional) service offices, or direct from NAWS.

Some literature is provided to new members for free (such as the &quot;Information Pamphlets&quot;) while other, typically book-length pieces, are sold at the purchase cost to the group. Literature is also purchased from Group contributions and made available to new members. NAWS receives 87% (2004/5) of its income from the sale of literature. Other expenses include group refreshments, meeting-place rent, etc. Financial information is publicly available on the NA website. The 2007 World Convention of NA ran at a net financial loss of $596,000.

==Effectiveness==
The first sophisticated outcome studies of NA were conducted in the early 1990s in London, England. The first study found a roughly linear relationship between the length of membership and abstinence with reduced anxiety and increased self-esteem While the NA sample had higher anxiety than the non-addicted comparison groups, these levels were equivalent for those with three or more years of membership, which is consistent with the hypothesis that NA membership reduces anxiety as well as substance use. This study also, contrary to the authors&#x27; expectations, found that spiritual beliefs and disease concept beliefs were not prerequisites for attendance of NA and even if these beliefs were adopted they were not found to cause external attributions for previous drug use or possible future lapse events.

A study of the early experience of new NA members in Victoria Australia in 1995 interviewed 91 members initially and 62 (68%) after 12 months and found that higher self-help participation as measured by service role involvement, step work, and stable meeting attendance, in the 12 months before the follow-up was associated with a four-fold reduction in levels of hazardous drug and alcohol use, less illicit income and sickness benefits and higher emotional support at reinterview.

One approach is to provide professional 12-step facilitation (TSF) either in an individual or group setting. TSF sessions are designed to introduce the patient to 12-step concepts and facilitate the entry of the patient into community-based 12-step programs. It must be emphasized that TSF is not NA, it is an implementation of 12-step program elements by a professional counsellor. NA recommends 12 step work with another member who has worked the steps.

One study, sponsored by NIDA, randomly assigned people using cocaine into four groups, individual drug counseling plus group drug counseling (GDC), cognitive therapy plus GDC, supportive expressive therapy plus GDC, or GDC alone. Individual drug counseling was based on the 12-step philosophy. Group drug counseling was designed to educate patients about the stages of recovery from addiction, to strongly encourage participation in 12-step programs, and to provide a supportive group atmosphere for initiating abstinence and an alternative lifestyle. Nearly 500 patients participated in the study.

The results suggested that all four treatment conditions resulted in similar reductions in cocaine use with the IDC + GDC group (TSF) more effective than the other three groups. One issue with this study is that there was significant attrition of patients, with significantly larger numbers of dropouts from the TSF groups than from the others.

=== Fiorentine 1999 ===
Fiorentine 1999 was a 24-month longitudinal study measuring the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous and NA. Like other longitudinal studies, it shows a strong correlation between 12-step attendance and being both clean from drugs and sober from alcohol: People who went to 12-step meetings in the study had about a 75% success rate.

In more detail, at the 24-month follow up, 77.7% of people who went to one or more meetings a week self-reported being clean; urinalysis was very close to that figure, showing some 76.4% of the regular attendees being clean. For participants who did not regularly go to meetings, the self-reported figure for being abstinent was 56% and the drug test showed 57.9% being clean. The self-reported figures for excessive alcohol use were similar: 74.8% of regular 12-step attenders self-reported being completely sober, but only 40% of people who did not go to 12-step meetings claimed to be sober. Urinalysis showed 96.6% of people regularly going to meetings as sober, in contrast to the 88.9% of people who did not go to meetings once a week or more whose urine sample was alcohol-free.

The report then sees if 12-step meetings have a specific effect (in other words, if there is causation or merely correlation) by using statistical analysis to compare participants self-reported level of motivation, 12-step attendance, and successfully getting clean and sober. The result of this observation was that &quot;Weekly or more frequent 12-step participants are 1.59 times more likely than less-than-weekly participants to maintain abstinence after controlling for the differences in recovery motivation measured by the scale.&quot;

==Controversies==

The NA program attempts to avoid controversy through its application of the 12 traditions, which specify that &quot;Narcotics Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the NA name ought never be drawn into public controversy.&quot; Even so, the Basic Text points out that there are still &quot;communication problems, differences of opinion, internal controversies, and troubles with individuals and groups outside the Fellowship&quot;, and various controversies of this type have disturbed NA throughout its history.

===Internal controversies===
Early in the history of NA, different groups emphasized different aspects of recovery. In particular, the make-up and process of creating an NA text was a contentious period for the fellowship. Different factions supported different versions of the Basic Text, and in the ensuing power struggle there were many accusations made and resentments cultivated. The basis of the dispute was whether the service committees were described as a part of NA, or as a separate entity, basically a tool of the NA groups with no decision-making power; instead being charged with collecting the decisions of the NA groups themselves. This dispute reached its nadir when the NA World Service Office sued an NA member in an attempt to prevent him from distributing free versions of the Basic Text. Today there are some NA groups who use a self-produced version of the Basic Text that has come to be known as the Baby Blue which is basically the Third Edition, Revised Basic Text (except that it contains originally approved essays on the Traditions). Some Traditionalist groups use the Second Edition or Approval Draft (both of which contain the original Traditions and are nearly identical to each other).

===Approaches of other twelve-step groups===
NA is unusual but not unique in its focus on the symptom/substance not being the core problem, but rather the disease of addiction, as is stated in the NA Step 1. In NA, it does not matter what substance you used, and alcohol is seen as a drug. 12-step groups differ in their approach to the treatment of addiction and recovery. Alcoholics Anonymous &quot;is a program for alcoholics who seek freedom from alcohol&quot; but does refer to &quot;some AA members who have misused drugs...in such a manner as to become a threat to the achievement and maintenance of sobriety&quot; and mentions that drugs can &quot;create a dependence just as devastating as dependence on alcohol&quot;. Cocaine Anonymous originally formed to address the special needs of cocaine addicts, but &quot;is not a drug specific fellowship&quot; and &quot;welcomes anyone with a drug or alcohol problem and offers a solution&quot;. CA&#x27;s program involves abstaining from cocaine &quot;and all other mind-altering substances&quot;, thus taking the same stance as NA pertaining to abstinence from all drugs, including alcohol and marijuana. Methadone Anonymous is similar to NA, but considers the use of methadone to be a tool of recovery and not a drug. NA has no opinion on these groups, as these are outside issues and the traditions suggest against taking a definitive stand on outside issues.

<doc id="255405" wikidata="Q190151" url="?curid=255405" title="Bruce Dickinson">
<text>Paul Bruce Dickinson (born 7 August 1958) is an English singer who is best known as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Dickinson has performed in the band across two stints, from 1981 to 1993 and from 1999 to the present day. He is known for his wide-ranging operatic vocal style and energetic stage presence.

Dickinson began his career in music fronting small pub bands in the 1970s while attending school in Sheffield and university in London. In 1979, he joined British new wave heavy metal band Samson, with whom he gained some popularity under the stage name &quot;Bruce Bruce&quot; and performed on two studio records. He left Samson in 1981 to join Iron Maiden, replacing Paul Di&#x27;Anno, and debuted on their 1982 album &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;. During his first tenure in the band, they issued a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Dickinson quit Iron Maiden in 1993 (being replaced by Blaze Bayley) to pursue his solo career, which saw him experiment with a wide variety of heavy metal and rock styles. He rejoined the band in 1999, along with guitarist Adrian Smith, and has released six subsequent studio albums with the band. Since his return to Iron Maiden, he has released two further solo records, in 2005, &quot;Tyranny of Souls&quot; and &quot;The Mandrake Project&quot; in 2024. His younger cousin, Rob Dickinson, is the former lead singer of British alternative rock band Catherine Wheel, while his son, Austin, fronted the metalcore band Rise to Remain. Since Bruce Dickinson joined Iron Maiden in 1981, the band has sold well over 100 million albums as of 2024.

Outside his career in music, Dickinson has pursued a number of other activities. He undertook a career as a commercial pilot for Astraeus Airlines, which led to a number of media-reported ventures such as captaining Iron Maiden&#x27;s converted charter aeroplane, Ed Force One, during their world tours. Following Astraeus&#x27; closure, in 2012 he created his own aircraft maintenance and pilot training company, Cardiff Aviation. Dickinson presented his own radio show on BBC Radio 6 Music from 2002 to 2010, and has also hosted television documentaries, authored novels and film scripts, created a beer with Robinsons Brewery and competed at fencing internationally.

==Early life==
Paul Bruce Dickinson was born on 7 August 1958 in Worksop, Nottinghamshire. His mother, Sonia, worked part-time in a shoe shop, and his father, Bruce, was a mechanic in the British Army. His birth hurried the young couple, who were then just teenagers, into marriage. Initially, he was brought up by his grandparents; his grandfather was a coal-face worker at the local colliery, and his grandmother was a housewife. This is referred to in his song &quot;Born In &#x27;58&quot; from the album &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;. Dickinson started school at Manton Primary in Worksop while his parents moved away to Sheffield. Soon afterwards, when he was six, he was also despatched to Sheffield, where he attended a primary school in Manor Top. After six months, his parents decided to move him to a small private school called Sharrow Vale Junior. Due to constant moving, Dickinson states that this period of his life taught him to be self-reliant as he was unable to make close friends. Dickinson has a younger sister, professional showjumper Helena Stormanns, who was born in 1963. He tried to isolate himself from her as much as he could when he was young, supposedly out of spite because she, unlike him, was a planned pregnancy and birth.

Dickinson&#x27;s first musical experience was dancing in his grandparents&#x27; front room to Chubby Checker&#x27;s &quot;The Twist&quot;, when he still lived with them in Worksop. The first record Dickinson recalls owning was the Beatles single &quot;She Loves You&quot;, which he managed to persuade his grandfather to buy him, which made him more interested in music. He tried to play an acoustic guitar belonging to his father, but it blistered his fingers. By the time he moved to Sheffield, Dickinson&#x27;s parents were earning a good living from buying property, refurbishing it and then selling it for a profit. As a result, much of Dickinson&#x27;s childhood was spent living on a building site, until his parents bought a boarding house and a bankrupt garage where his father began selling second-hand cars. The income from their business success gave them the opportunity to give Dickinson—then 13 years old—a boarding school education and they chose Oundle, a public school in Northamptonshire. Dickinson was not opposed to moving away from home because he had not built &quot;any real attachment&quot; to his parents, having been raised by his grandparents in Worksop until he was six.

At Oundle, Dickinson was picked on and routinely bullied by the older boys of Sidney House, the boarding house that he belonged to, which he described as &quot;like systematic torture&quot; and meant that he became an outsider. His interests at Oundle were often military; he co-founded the school wargames society with Mike Jordan, and he joined the school&#x27;s cadet force. This gave him access to live ammunition, which he used to create explosions as booby-traps. Oundle was where Dickinson became attracted to progressive rock and early heavy metal after hearing Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Child in Time&quot; being played in another student&#x27;s room. As a result, the first album he ever bought was Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;In Rock&quot;, which created his interest in rock and metal music. After &quot;In Rock&quot;, he went on to buy Black Sabbath&#x27;s debut, Jethro Tull&#x27;s &quot;Aqualung&quot; and &quot;Tarkus&quot; by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Every term, a band would play at the school, the first of these which Dickinson saw was called Wild Turkey, featuring former Jethro Tull bassist Glenn Cornick. After that, he saw Van der Graaf Generator and Arthur Brown.

Dickinson initially wanted to play the drums, later obtaining a pair of bongo drums from the music room for practice. He remembers playing &quot;Let It Be&quot; with his friend Mike Jordan, during which Dickinson discovered his singing voice while encouraging Jordan to sing the high-notes. Shortly afterwards Dickinson was expelled from Oundle for participating in a prank in which he allegedly urinated in the headmaster&#x27;s dinner. Returning home to Sheffield in 1976, Dickinson enrolled at King Edward VII School, at which he joined his first band. He had overheard two other pupils talking about their band and that they needed a singer and so volunteered immediately. They rehearsed in the garage of the drummer&#x27;s father, and the band were impressed by Dickinson&#x27;s singing, encouraging him to buy his first microphone. Their first gig took place at the Broadfield Tavern in Sheffield. Originally called &quot;Paradox&quot;, the band changed their name on Dickinson&#x27;s suggestion to &quot;Styx&quot;, unaware of the American act with the same name. They made local newspaper headlines when a steel worker was awoken by their performance and tried to smash the band&#x27;s drum kit. Soon afterwards the band split up.

After leaving school with A-levels in English, History, and Economics, Dickinson confessed, &quot;I didn&#x27;t really know what I wanted to do.&quot; The first thing he did was join the Territorial Army for six months. Although he enjoyed his time in the TA, Dickinson realised that it was not a career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London. His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his &quot;cover story&quot;, and immediately began playing in bands. At university, Dickinson got involved in the Entertainments Committee: &quot;one day you&#x27;d be a roadie for the Jam, the next you&#x27;d be putting up the Stonehenge backdrop for Hawkwind or whatever.&quot; In 1977, Dickinson met Paul &quot;Noddy&quot; White, a multi-instrumentalist who owned a public address system (PA) and other equipment, with whom Dickinson, along with drummer Steve Jones, would form a band together called Speed. According to Dickinson, the band was called Speed because of the way in which they played, rather than a reference to drug-taking. In Speed, Dickinson began writing his own material after White taught him how to play three chords on the guitar.

Although Speed would play several gigs at the Green Man pub in Plumstead, the band did not last long, but it encouraged Dickinson to continue to work towards being a musician. Dickinson spotted an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; with the caption &quot;Singer wanted for recording project&quot; and replied immediately. He recorded a demo tape and sent it with a note which read: &quot;By the way, if you think the singing&#x27;s crap, there&#x27;s some John Cleese stuff recorded on the other side you might find amusing.&quot; They liked what they heard and invited Dickinson down to the studio to make &quot;Dracula&quot;, the first song he would ever record, with a band called &quot;Shots&quot;, formed by two brothers, Phil and Doug Siviter. The song would later appear on the second disc of &quot;The Best of Bruce Dickinson&quot; compilation. The brothers were impressed with Dickinson&#x27;s vocal abilities and asked him to join their group.

Dickinson played pubs with Shots on a regular basis to small audiences. One particular night, Dickinson suddenly stopped in the middle of a song and started interviewing a man in the audience, heckling for not paying enough attention. He got such a good response he started doing it every night until it became a regular routine used to catch the audience&#x27;s attention. Dickinson states that this experience taught him how to be a frontman. The next step in Dickinson&#x27;s career was taken in a pub called the Prince of Wales in Gravesend, Kent, where Shots were playing regularly, when Barry Graham (&quot;Thunderstick&quot;) and Paul Samson paid a visit. Impressed with his stage-act, they talked with Dickinson afterwards and invited him to be their new singer. Dickinson agreed to join their band, Samson, but only once he&#x27;d finished taking his History finals two weeks later. Until that point, he had been neglecting his University education. As a result, the university had tried to kick him out for failing his Second Year exams and not paying his accommodation fees, but he was saved because of his role as Entertainments Officer. After writing six months&#x27; worth of essays in the space of two weeks and some last minute cramming for his exams, Dickinson achieved a 2:2.

==Samson: 1979–1981==

After meeting Paul Samson and Barry Purkis at the Prince of Wales, and while still undertaking his final university exams, Dickinson joined Samson onstage at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford to perform one of their songs, &quot;Rock Me Baby&quot;, cementing his role as their new lead vocalist.

The band had already released their debut album, &quot;Survivors&quot;, in 1979 on an independent label, two months before Dickinson joined. Immediately following the completion of his University work, he met up with the band at Greenwich&#x27;s Wood Wharf studios to learn the &quot;Survivors&quot; album. Although the tracks did not suit his vocal style, the band soon wrote the majority of the following &quot;Head On&quot; album in their earliest rehearsal sessions, some of which were immediately incorporated into their live set.

It was during these early rehearsals that the nickname &quot;Bruce Bruce&quot; came about, derived from Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Bruces sketch&quot;. The name became very tiresome as the band&#x27;s management continually wrote dud cheques, made payable to &quot;Bruce Bruce&quot;, as a joke. Dickinson later commented that he did not like it but considered it &quot;a sort of stage name&quot; and accepted it.

Dickinson was dismayed to learn that not all rock performers were &quot;great artists&quot;; he felt that some, such as Samson, were only interested in women, drugs and alcohol, which he was unable to relate to. Although he had smoked joints before, Dickinson discovered that it was impossible to communicate with other band members if he was sober, deciding that it was &quot;the price that had to be paid&quot;.

While fronting the band, Dickinson also came across Iron Maiden for the first time, who were supporting Samson at the Music Machine in 1980. As Dickinson recalls; &quot;I was watching them, and they were good, really fucking good, and at that moment, I remember thinking, &#x27;I wanna fucking sing for that band. In fact, I&#x27;m &quot;going&quot; to sing for that band! I &quot;know&quot; I&#x27;m going to sing for that band!&#x27; ... I just thought, &#x27;This is really me. Not Samson.&#x27;&quot;

Dickinson remained in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them—&quot;Head On&quot; and &quot;Shock Tactics&quot;. However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, who went out of business and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden. The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and they could not be paid for their concert performances. The band&#x27;s last gig was at Reading Festival, after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maiden&#x27;s manager, Rod Smallwood, who asked him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.

==Iron Maiden==
===Beginnings and success: 1981–1985===

Dickinson went to audition for Iron Maiden at a rehearsal room in Hackney in September 1981 and immediately discovered that this was a much more professional operation than he was used to with Samson. In the practice rooms, the band played through &quot;Prowler&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Running Free&quot; and &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;, before asking Dickinson to sing the same songs again in a recording studio, and he was immediately inducted into the group.

Iron Maiden had a strict and organised routine that suited the band&#x27;s writing style, which Dickinson described as a &quot;time table&quot;. After a few gigs, they began writing new material for their third album, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, released in 1982. In the wake of Samson&#x27;s contractual problems, Dickinson could not legally be credited on any of the record&#x27;s songs, having to make, what he called, a &quot;moral contribution&quot;, later revealing that he had contributed to &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot;. In the documentary &quot;12 Wasted Years&quot;, manager Rod Smallwood refers to &quot;The Prisoner&quot; as being co-written by Dickinson and Adrian Smith. The album was a major success, topping the British charts, and earning platinum status in the UK and the US. Following the release, the band embarked on a supporting tour around the globe.

On the following albums, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Powerslave&quot;, Steve Harris&#x27;s song-writing monopoly was pushed aside in favour of other members&#x27; ideas, with Dickinson contributing to a number of tracks, including the singles &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; and &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;. Throughout the World Slavery Tour, as part of the new theatrical elements incorporated into the band&#x27;s stage-show, Dickinson wore a feathered mask during &quot;Powerslave&quot;. This was the band&#x27;s longest tour to date, during which Dickinson considered going home mid-tour, due to the high number of shows. Iron Maiden&#x27;s management were continually adding dates, until Dickinson demanded that they stop or he would leave the group.

===Growing tensions and departure: 1986–1993===
After a six-month break, which Dickinson mostly spent practising fencing, Iron Maiden began writing their next album, &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. Dickinson was disappointed with the effort as he felt that the band needed a more dramatic stylistic departure from past records to remain relevant, despite its introduction of synthesised bass and guitars. He has no writing credits on the release, as his material, based on his own suggestion that the album should be more acoustic-focused, was rejected by the rest of the band. Steve Harris, on the other hand, stated that his material was rejected because it was not good enough, and that Dickinson &quot;was probably more burnt out than anyone at the end of the last tour&quot;.

After a subsequent tour, Iron Maiden started working on their next studio effort, &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot;, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band&#x27;s previous records. Although it became their second release to top the British charts, it was also Dickinson&#x27;s first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US. Unlike &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, Dickinson was much more enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits. After the following tour in 1988, the band decided to take a year off.

During the next album&#x27;s writing stage, Adrian Smith left Iron Maiden, and was replaced by Janick Gers. Iron Maiden&#x27;s eighth studio release, 1990&#x27;s &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;, had a raw sound that, according to a retrospective assessment by AllMusic, did not &quot;hold up well&quot; compared to past efforts, as it was recorded in a barn which Steve Harris owned, with a mobile studio owned by the Rolling Stones. The record featured Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot;, originally composed for a film soundtrack, which despite receiving a Golden Raspberry Award for worst original song in 1989, became the band&#x27;s first and only single to top the UK Singles Chart. By 1992, Harris had converted his barn into a proper studio, and the new album, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, was recorded there, resulting in a better overall sound than &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;, although Dickinson still says it had limitations due to its size.

After the Fear of the Dark Tour, Dickinson decided to leave Iron Maiden to concentrate on his solo career. At that point the band had already booked a following tour in 1993, which Dickinson did not enjoy. Throughout the tour, Dickinson drew a lot of criticism from his bandmates, with Steve Harris in particular saying, &quot;I really wanted to kill him.&quot; According to Harris, Dickinson would only perform when the press was there, whereas at other concerts he would only mumble his way through songs. Dickinson has since denied the accusations that he was deliberately under-performing, arguing that it was impossible to give a decent performance some nights because of the atmosphere. His last performance with the band on 28 August 1993 was filmed by the BBC at Pinewood Studios and released as a live video the following year, entitled &quot;Raising Hell&quot;.

===Return: 1999–present===

Along with Adrian Smith, Dickinson rejoined Iron Maiden in 1999 with Janick Gers remaining in the band, after he was approached by manager Rod Smallwood. Smallwood also spoke to Steve Harris about Dickinson&#x27;s return, who initially had reservations about the prospect, but soon came round to the idea, deliberating that they knew of his abilities and that it was a case of &quot;better the devil you know&quot;. Harris and Dickinson agreed to meet at Smallwood&#x27;s home in Brighton in January 1999 for the first conversation they would have with each other since 1993. Although both men were nervous about the encounter, upon seeing each other the tension immediately dissipated and both agreed that Dickinson should return to the group.

After embarking on a small tour, the band set about recording &quot;Brave New World&quot;, their first studio album with Dickinson since 1992. Dickinson insisted that they find a replacement for the now retired Martin Birch, the band&#x27;s regular producer, and record in a different studio than the one in which they made &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; and &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, to which Harris agreed. The album was recorded at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer Kevin Shirley, after which Iron Maiden undertook a supporting tour culminating with a performance at the Rock in Rio festival before a crowd of 250,000.

In 2003, they recorded and released &quot;Dance of Death&quot; at London&#x27;s SARM Studios with Kevin Shirley, now the band&#x27;s new regular producer. After two further stints on the road (Dance of Death World Tour and Eddie Rips Up the World Tour) Iron Maiden returned to SARM in 2006 to record their next studio album, &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;, and embarked on a supporting tour. In 2008 and 2009, the band set out on the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, which has since been described as &quot;groundbreaking&quot; for its use of &quot;Ed Force One&quot;, the band&#x27;s customised Boeing 757, flown by Dickinson himself, and led to the documentary film &quot;Iron Maiden: Flight 666&quot;, which had a limited cinema release in April 2009. Iron Maiden held another world tour in 2010 and 2011 in support of &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;, their first album recorded at Compass Point Studios, Nassau, Bahamas since 1986&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, and which peaked at No. 1 in 28 countries.

In September 2014, Iron Maiden began recording their sixteenth studio album, &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;, at Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris. The release features two songs written solely by Dickinson for the first time since &quot;Powerslave&quot;, &quot;If Eternity Should Fail&quot; and &quot;Empire of the Clouds&quot;, the former originally penned for a possible solo record. &quot;Empire of the Clouds&quot; is the band&#x27;s longest ever song, at over 18 minutes in length, and features Dickinson on piano for the first time, which is how the song was written. The band toured the album in 2016, during which Dickinson once again piloted the band&#x27;s private plane, Ed Force One (now a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet).

Ozzfest incident

In 2005, Iron Maiden co-headlined the US festival tour, Ozzfest, with Black Sabbath. Lead singer Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s wife, Sharon, encouraged family friends and members of other bands to sabotage Iron Maiden&#x27;s last performance at Hyundai Pavilion in San Bernardino, California, on 20 August, in an attack which Rod Smallwood criticised as &quot;vile, dangerous, criminal and cowardly&quot;, as well as disrespectful to fans who had paid to see the band perform &quot;a full unhindered performance&quot;. Osbourne ordered interference with the band&#x27;s PA, delayed the entrance of Eddie, the band&#x27;s mascot, and encouraged members of the Osbourne camp to throw eggs, lighters and bottle tops from the front of the audience.
According to Dickinson, the attack was in response to his &quot;disparaging remarks about reality TV shows that she took personally&quot;, although &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that he slated the Osbournes&#x27; reality series and accused Ozzy Osbourne of using a teleprompter. Dickinson has since denied making comments against Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath, but admitted that he criticised Ozzfest throughout the tour, attacking their &quot;corporate&quot; seating layout and saying, &quot;Most of the bands are there because they paid to be there.&quot;

Following the concert at San Bernardino, Osbourne released a further statement which accused Dickinson of making several anti-American comments, for which &quot;Classic Rock&quot; stated that &quot;nobody can present any cast-iron evidence&quot;. In addition, Osbourne claimed that the flag-waving during &quot;The Trooper&quot; was disrespectful to American troops, at the time fighting alongside the British in Iraq, even though Dickinson had always held a Union Flag during the song, being based on the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War. It was also reported that Steve Harris had spoken to Ozzy Osbourne in San Bernardino, apologising for Dickinson&#x27;s comments, which Harris denies, stating that his words had been &quot;twisted&quot;.

July 2022 Athens concert incident

Dickinson is known for publicly reprimanding fans at Iron Maiden concerts if he feels they are out of line. One such incident occurred during the band&#x27;s Legacy of the Beast Tour concert at the Olympic Stadium in Athens, Greece, on July 16, 2022, when Dickinson used offensive language to attack the nationality of a Greek fan who had lit up a flare as the frontman was about to sing &quot;The Number Of The Beast&quot;. His fans in Greece showed a degree of sympathy, but most were disappointed by the gesture, as lighting up flares when the band plays a classic hit is customary at Greek concerts to honor the band.

In February 2024, Dickinson admitted in an interview for the Greek magazine Rock Hard that he had lost his temper when asked about his reaction to the flare at the Athens 2022 concert.

==Solo career==

In early 1989, Zomba asked Dickinson to produce a track for the movie &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot;, providing a budget, a studio, and a producer, Chris Tsangarides. Dickinson took up the opportunity and called an old friend of his, former Gillan guitarist, Janick Gers, and, shortly after meeting up, they had &quot;Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter&quot; ready for the studio, then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr, and drummer Fabio del Rio. &quot;I wrote it in about three minutes&quot;, states Dickinson, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where the title &#x27;Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter&#x27; came from, but it just popped into my head. I thought, &#x27;Bloody hell, straight out of AC/DC!&#x27; And I thought, &quot;&#x27;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;. Yeah, that&#x27;ll do.&#x27; Impressed with the results, Zomba asked Dickinson if he was willing to record a whole album as well. With the same line-up and producer, Dickinson&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;, was written and recorded within two weeks, and released in May 1990, followed by a supporting tour.

Later that year, Dickinson participated on a re-recording of Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, as part of the humanitarian effort &quot;Rock Aid Armenia&quot;. Backed by the band Skin, he produced a cover version of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;Elected&quot;, along with Rowan Atkinson (in character as Mr. Bean), which was used in 1992 for Comic Relief, and five years later, on &quot;Bean Soundtrack&quot;.

For his second solo effort, Dickinson received the collaboration of American producer, Keith Olsen, and, while working on the record in LA, decided to leave Iron Maiden. Unhappy with the direction he was taking with Olsen, Dickinson began working with Tribe of Gypsies guitarist Roy Z and started the album again from scratch. &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; was recorded with Tribe of Gypsies as the backing band, and was released in 1994. That same year, Dickinson recorded a cover version of &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; with the band Godspeed for Black Sabbath&#x27;s tribute album &quot;Nativity in Black&quot;. Tribe of Gypsies departed to work on their own material and Dickinson tracked down another band, including his new writing partner and guitarist, Alex Dickson. While touring with this new outfit in 1994, Dickinson performed in Sarajevo, then under siege during the Bosnian War; a documentary film based on the concert, entitled &quot;Scream For Me Sarajevo&quot;, completed filming in December 2015.

After the &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; supporting tour finished, he started working on a new studio record, &quot;Skunkworks&quot;. Dickinson decided that &quot;Skunkworks&quot; would be the title of the band as well, but the record company refused to release the album without his name on the cover. Dickinson hired producer Jack Endino, most noted for producing the first Nirvana album. The &quot;Skunkworks&quot; entity ceased to be when the tour ended. &quot;I was devastated by the &quot;Skunkworks&quot; thing&quot;, stated Dickinson, &quot;&quot;Skunkworks&quot; was a record which I tore myself apart to make and nobody seemed to give a shit.&quot;

After a short period of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, &quot;Accident of Birth&quot;; &quot;It was actually Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, &#x27;Listen, I&#x27;ve got some stuff and it&#x27;s like a metal record.&#x27; And I wasn&#x27;t thrilled, I wasn&#x27;t really sure that I had anything to offer ... Then he played me some backing-tracks he&#x27;d done for what was to become &quot;Accident of Birth&quot; down the phone and I thought &#x27;There is something there.&#x27;&quot; Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson&#x27;s solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, &quot;The album&#x27;s heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90&#x27;s.&quot; The follow-up, &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot;, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake&#x27;s writings; with some songs, such as &quot;Book of Thel&quot;, having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings. The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, &quot;Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even be better than the previous one.&quot; During &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot;&#x27;s supporting tour, the live album, &quot;Scream for Me Brazil&quot; was recorded in São Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.

In 2000, Dickinson performed vocals on the song, &quot;Into the Black Hole&quot;, for Ayreon&#x27;s &quot;Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator&quot;. Later that year, he collaborated with Judas Priest&#x27;s front-man, Rob Halford, recording, &quot;The One You Love to Hate&quot;, for Halford&#x27;s debut, &quot;Resurrection&quot;. A compilation, entitled &quot;The Best of Bruce Dickinson&quot;, was released in late 2001, including two new songs and a bonus disc of rarities. His sixth solo album, &quot;Tyranny of Souls&quot; was released in May 2005. This time the song-writing was all split between Roy Z and Dickinson and many songs were composed by Z sending recordings of riffs to Dickinson while he was on tour with Iron Maiden. On 21 June 2005, Dickinson&#x27;s complete solo discography was re-released, featuring bonus discs with rare and remastered tracks. That same year, Dickinson contributed to the song, &quot;Beast in the Light&quot;, from Tribuzy&#x27;s album, &quot;Execution&quot;, and their subsequent live album. A three-DVD box set, entitled &quot;Anthology&quot;, was released on 19 June 2006, containing concerts and promo videos from throughout his solo career, as well as an old Samson video, entitled &quot;Biceps of Steel&quot;.

A fan of the Monty Python comedy troupe, in 2009 Dickinson appeared in &quot;Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)&quot;. He also recorded a new version of the theme song from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; for the sixth and final episode. In December 2017, Dickinson said that he has tentative plans for his next solo album to be &quot;a whole concept album&quot;, with the title being &quot;If Eternity Should Fail&quot;, the same song name from Iron Maiden&#x27;s album &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;, in which he confirmed that it was originally penned as a solo track, &quot;So if I did do another solo album, which I think I will, I might just stick to my original plan and have that as the title track. I mean, I did write it – it was the first track that I wrote for it. So, yeah, I&#x27;d probably still include that song. But it would be… the feel would be slightly different – not very much, though – from the Maiden version.&quot; Dickinson released &quot;The Mandrake Project&quot;, his first solo studio album in 19 years, in March 2024. It was produced by Roy Z.

==Personal life==

Dickinson married Erica &quot;Jane&quot; Barnett in 1984, and they divorced in 1987. With his second wife, psychotherapist Patrice &quot;Paddy&quot; Bowden, he has three children. All three were born in the Chiswick area of London, where Dickinson lived for a few decades beginning in 1981. In 2020, it was reported that he and Bowden had separated earlier after almost 30 years of marriage; Bowden died in an accident at her home in May 2020. Dickinson lives with his girlfriend Leana Dolci in Paris.

Dickinson&#x27;s son Austin was the lead singer in metalcore band Rise to Remain until their break-up in 2015, at which point he formed the alternative metal group As Lions. His other son Griffin, who previously worked as a stage carpenter for Iron Maiden during their tours, was the lead singer of melodic hardcore band SHVPES. Dickinson&#x27;s cousin, Rob Dickinson, was the lead singer of alternative rock band Catherine Wheel and founded the American company Singer Vehicle Design.

In an interview with Sarah Montague for BBC&#x27;s &quot;HARDtalk&quot; in 2012, Dickinson agreed that he is a conservative and a Eurosceptic. Dickinson said in a 2018 interview with French magazine &quot;L&#x27;Obs&quot; that, despite residing mainly in France, he supported Brexit and voted for the UK to leave the EU during the 2016 referendum. In 2021, after the Withdrawal Agreement entered into force, Dickinson said he was angry that British musicians and performers were restricted from free travel through Europe.

In 2015, Dickinson underwent seven weeks of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for a cancerous tumour found at the back of his tongue. Dickinson&#x27;s medical team expected him to make a full recovery as the tumour was discovered in the early stages. On 15 May, Dickinson was given the all-clear by his specialists.

== Special honours ==
On 19 July 2011, Dickinson was presented with an honorary music doctorate from his alma mater, Queen Mary University of London, in honour of his contribution to the music industry.

In 2019, Dickinson was made an honorary citizen of Sarajevo and received the city&#x27;s prestigious Sixth April Award for his efforts in performing under siege in 1994. According to the city&#x27;s mayor, it was his arrival in Sarajevo that &quot;was one of those moments that made us realize that we will survive, that the city of Sarajevo will survive, that Bosnia and Herzegovina will survive&quot;. He is also credited as a producer on the critically acclaimed 2016 documentary &quot;Scream for Me Sarajevo&quot;, which chronicles this performance and his return to Sarajevo.

In 2019, Dickinson was also presented with an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Philosophy by the University of Helsinki.

On 6 January 2020, Dickinson was made an Honorary Group Captain of 601 (County of London) Squadron RAF.

In 2024, Dickinson was made an honorary citizen of Curitiba City, Brazil.

==Other work==
Dickinson&#x27;s interests and non-musical activities include writing, broadcasting, fencing (at which he has competed internationally, placing 7th in Great Britain, and has founded a fencing equipment company under the brand name &quot;Duellist&quot;), beer brewing and aviation. Due to the wide variety of Dickinson&#x27;s pursuits, &quot;Intelligent Life&quot; named him as a living example of a polymath in 2009.

===Aviation and entrepreneurship===

Dickinson learned to fly recreationally in Florida in the 1990s and now holds an airline transport pilot&#x27;s licence. He regularly flew Boeing 757s in his role as captain for the now-defunct British charter airline Astraeus, which, from 16 September 2010, employed him as marketing director. One of his key roles in that position was to promote Astraeus&#x27; services by increasing their number of videos, leading to the Civil Aviation Authority releasing a video featuring Dickinson on aircraft loading safety in June 2011.

Following Astraeus&#x27; closure on 21 November 2011, Dickinson branched into entrepreneurship when he launched Cardiff Aviation Ltd on 1 May 2012, an aircraft maintenance business based at the Twin Peaks Hangar in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, in January 2013 Cardiff Aviation had created 40 jobs and hoped to have over a hundred personnel by the summer of 2013. In June 2013, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that the business had expanded to between 60 and 70 employees and were in discussions to set up their own airline. In August 2015, Cardiff Aviation signed a deal to provide airline support to Air Djibouti, for whom Dickinson piloted their maiden flight the following year, a Boeing 737 from Cardiff to Djibouti. As a result of his business ventures, Dickinson delivered keynote speeches at events around the globe, including Queen Mary University of London&#x27;s Innovation Showcase in November 2012, Connect2Business, Stockholm in March 2013, &quot;Aviation Week&quot;&#x27;s MRO Europe Conference, London in October 2015 and &quot;Blog Now, Live Forever&quot;, Mumbai in October 2015.
Dickinson&#x27;s role as a pilot has led to some high-profile flights, which include returning a group of British RAF pilots from Afghanistan in 2008, 200 British citizens from Lebanon during the Israel/Hezbollah conflict in 2006, and 180 stranded holiday makers from Egypt following the collapse of XL Airways UK in September 2008. In addition, he flew Rangers F.C. and Liverpool F.C. to away matches in Israel and Italy in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

For the 2008–09 &quot;Somewhere Back in Time World Tour&quot;, he piloted Iron Maiden&#x27;s chartered Boeing 757, dubbed &quot;Ed Force One&quot;, specially converted to carry the band&#x27;s equipment between continents, which subsequently led to a documentary film, &quot;Iron Maiden: Flight 666&quot;. Dickinson flew &quot;Ed Force One&quot; again for &quot;The Final Frontier World Tour&quot; in 2011. For the 2016 The Book of Souls World Tour, the band upgraded to a Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, which meant that Dickinson had to undertake type conversion to fly the aircraft. In 2014, Dickinson purchased a Fokker Dr.I triplane replica G-CDXR and joined the Great War Display Team, which re-enacts First World War air battles at air shows across the UK.

===Radio and TV===

Dickinson presented &quot;Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s Friday Rock Show&quot; on BBC Radio 6 Music from 2002 to 2010. In March 2010, the BBC announced that, after over eight years, Dickinson&#x27;s show was to be axed. His final broadcast was on 28 May 2010, with the regular format abandoned in favour of a personal and musical tribute to the recently deceased Ronnie James Dio. Dickinson scorned BBC executives for the cancellation, playing the Johnny Paycheck version of &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;. In addition to his show on 6 Music, Dickinson also hosted a series entitled &quot;Masters of Rock&quot; on BBC Radio 2 from 2003 to 2007. Dickinson&#x27;s catalogue of 6 Music programmes were acquired in 2014 by TeamRock radio, who began re-broadcasting episodes in December.

In 2005, Dickinson hosted a five-part historical TV series about aviation, &quot;Flying Heavy Metal&quot;, shown on the Discovery Channel and later on Discovery Turbo in the UK. He was a guest on an episode of the Military Channel&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Ever&quot;, where he drove a Russian T-34 tank. In 2006, Dickinson presented a documentary for Sky One called &quot;Inside Spontaneous Human Combustion with Bruce Dickinson&quot;, in which he investigated the phenomenon by enlisting the help of several experts and performing various experiments to determine its possible cause. Other television appearances include guesting on quiz shows such as &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; and the short-lived &quot;Space Cadets&quot;, as well as the chat show &quot;Clarkson&quot;, hosted by Jeremy Clarkson. Dickinson has also appeared in a BBC series called &quot;The Paradise Club&quot;, undertaking the role of a musician named Jake Skinner. On 27 July 2012, Dickinson spent a day being filmed as a guest star for a season four episode of &quot;Ice Pilots NWT&quot;, in which he flew a Douglas DC-3 and took part in &quot;touch-and-go drills&quot; in a Douglas DC-4 with Buffalo Airways.

===Writing===
During a 1986–1987 Iron Maiden tour, and in the wake of a divorce, Dickinson started writing his first book. Inspired by the novels of Tom Sharpe, in addition to Biggles and &quot;Penthouse&quot;, he created &quot;The Adventures of Lord Iffy Boatrace&quot;, which &quot;Kerrang!&quot; describes as &quot;a satirical swipe at fetishism among the upper classes&quot;, and whose title character is a &quot;semi-transvestite&quot; British land owner.

Following its completion, Dickinson approached Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, who, according to Dickinson, agreed to publish the book before reading it, solely based on Iron Maiden&#x27;s album sales. Released in 1990 , the novel sold more than 40,000 copies almost immediately. Due to the high demand, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson asked Dickinson to produce a sequel, which became 1992&#x27;s &quot;The Missionary Position&quot; , a satire of televangelism. No further additions to the series have been published, although Dickinson did write the first 60 pages to a prequel, set during &quot;Lord Iffy&#x27;s schooldays&quot;, which he &quot;just thought was rubbish and ripped it all up. I didn&#x27;t think it was funny.&quot;

Dickinson also turned his hand to scriptwriting, co-authoring &quot;Chemical Wedding&quot; with director Julian Doyle. The film, in which Dickinson played a few small cameo roles and composed the soundtrack, was released in 2008 and starred Simon Callow.

On 15 October 2015, HarperCollins and Dey Street announced that they would publish Dickinson&#x27;s memoirs. &quot;What Does This Button Do?&quot; was released on 19 October 2017.

===Beer===
In 2013, Iron Maiden collaborated with Robinsons Brewery in Stockport to create Trooper, a 4.8% cask/4.7% bottled ale whose recipe Dickinson formulated with head brewer Martyn Weeks. As of May 2014, the beer has sold 2.5 million pints in 40 countries, making it Robinsons&#x27; most successful export.

Following Trooper&#x27;s success, Dickinson, a fan of traditional English cask beer, stated that he intends to develop more beers in the future, although new products will be &quot;under the umbrella of Trooper and not Iron Maiden [as] Trooper has taken on a life of its own. People drink it because they like the beer, not because they are Maiden fans.&quot; Additional beers have included Trooper Red &#x27;N&#x27; Black Porter (5.8 per cent ABV), Trooper Hallowed (6.0 per cent ABV), and a limited-edition &quot;666&quot; (at 6.66 per cent ABV).

In 2023, Dickinson created a &quot;Trooper Progressive Lager&quot; together with the German craft beer brewery Crew Republic.

==Singing style and stage performance==

Although Dickinson never received formal training, he possesses a wide vocal range which is characterised by his quasi-operatic tenor. Along with Ronnie James Dio and Rob Halford, Dickinson is one of the pioneers of the operatic vocal style later to be adopted by power metal vocalists and regularly appears near the top in lists of the greatest rock vocalists/front-men of all time. Dickinson says that his style was influenced primarily by Arthur Brown, Peter Hammill (Van der Graaf Generator), Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) and Ian Gillan (Deep Purple).

Dickinson&#x27;s singing varied in the 1990s in the recording of albums such as &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot;, &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; and his first solo work &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;, making use of a much more raspy and unpolished sound, befitting their stripped down style. Since returning to Iron Maiden in 1999, his singing style has returned to much like it was in the 1980s, though his voice has lowered with age. According to a report published in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Dickinson has an estimated vocal range of 4.25 octaves. His voice led to the nickname &quot;The Air Raid Siren&quot;, which &quot;Billboard&quot; states is &quot;due to the ferocious power of his singing&quot;, although Dickinson said it actually originated from a fan complaint.

In addition to his vocal ability, Dickinson has been described as an energetic stage performer. He considers including the audience &quot;the essence of the Maiden experience&quot; and that his role is to &quot;shrink the venue ... to turn that football stadium into the world&#x27;s smallest club&quot;. To achieve this, Dickinson seeks eye contact with audience members and urges them to join in with the phrase &quot;scream for me&quot; (followed by the concert&#x27;s location). He is critical of performers who do not connect with their fans, particularly those who &quot;[hide] behind the amps&quot; and use an autocue, remarking that &quot;people pay good money and [they] can&#x27;t even remember the sodding words&quot;.

<doc id="255406" wikidata="Q2498251" url="?curid=255406" title="Hatter's Castle">
<text>Hatter&#x27;s Castle (1931) is the first novel of author A. J. Cronin. The story is set in 1879, in the fictional town of Levenford, on the Firth of Clyde. The plot revolves around many characters and has many subplots, all of which relate to the life of the hatter, James Brodie, whose narcissism and cruelty gradually destroy his family and life. The book was made into a successful film in 1942 starring Robert Newton, Deborah Kerr, and James Mason.

==Characters==
The main characters are James Brodie (the hatter and tyrannical patriarch of the Brodie family), Mary Brodie (James&#x27;s elder daughter, also one of the central characters, appearing throughout the first and last section of the novel), Matthew Brodie (James&#x27;s only son and oldest child in the family who also plays a significant role in the novel), Nessie Brodie (James&#x27;s younger daughter and favourite, who remains one of the background characters until the end of the story), Mrs. Brodie (James&#x27;s fragile wife who is never treated as anything more than a servant by her husband), Grandma Brodie (James&#x27;s mother who lives with the Brodie family), Dennis Foyle (A young Irishman who has a relationship with Mary), Nancy (James&#x27;s mistress) and Dr. Renwick (a character who becomes more involved in the Brodies&#x27; family life towards the end of the novel).

==Plot summary==
The book is in three sections.

===Part 1===
The novel begins with some insight into the life of the Brodie household, where James Brodie seems to have everyone under his thumb. The main event that triggers the events in the novel is Mary Brodie&#x27;s relationship with her first love, Dennis. Early in the story, Mary, who has occasionally met Dennis at the library, is invited by him to go to the fair in the town. She sneaks out without her family&#x27;s knowledge and not only goes to the fair, but later on that night kisses and eventually makes love to Dennis, which we later learn, results in pregnancy.

This event of her unwanted pregnancy is the main plot in the first third of the novel, titled &quot;Section One&quot;. We realise that Mary is pregnant, and when she is six months pregnant she makes a plan with Dennis to elope. Even though Mary was only seventeen, there would have been no legal problem with her marriage since the English law which, until 1970, generally required people under twenty-one to have parental consent to marry, did not apply in Scotland. But three days before Dennis is due to whisk Mary away, there is a massive storm, and she begins to go into labour. Mrs. Brodie stumbles into Mary&#x27;s room and begins to scream at the fact that her daughter is with child, and calls James himself to sort it out. After being kicked in the stomach repeatedly by her father and thrown out on her face into the pouring rain (while in labour), she tries to reach safety. Mary nearly drowns in a river before finding a barn where she gives birth to her premature child, which dies. Dennis, who was, travelling on a train to rescue Mary, is killed when the train derails and plunges into the River Tay below, a retelling of the actual Tay Bridge disaster of 1879. 
===Part 2===
In the second part of the book, James Brodie&#x27;s business as a hatter is destroyed. A rival company moves next door and attracts all his customers. Part of this is due to Brodie&#x27;s pride, as the customers are driven away by his delusions of superiority. As his profits decrease, so does the weekly salary, so Mamma is left to deal with making the most of what little they have left for the family. Her illness, cancer of the womb, and the chronic stress of living with James Brodie hasten her death. After her death, Brodie&#x27;s mistress, Nancy, moves in. Later she goes off abroad with Brodie&#x27;s son Matt, and Brodie is left with only his younger daughter, Nessie, and his aged mother, Grandma Brodie.

===Part 3===
In the third part of the book, Brodie forces Nessie to study hard so as to win the &quot;Latta&quot;, a valuable bursarship. He wants this not so much to provide a good future for his daughter, as to show that she is better than his rival&#x27;s son, who is also entered for it. Under his threats and the dreadful fear of failure, she labours on with it, making herself mentally and physically ill. Nessie secretly writes to Mary asking her to come back, so she will have her company and comfort. Under pretext of coming to help with housework, Mary writes to her father, who initially refuses her return. After discovering that Nancy has deserted him, he writes again permitting Mary to come back, so she does.

Nessie obtains notice of the Latta result before her father sees it. Finding that her rival has won it and fearing her father, she sends Mary out to the chemist on the pretext of getting some medicine, then dresses up and hangs herself.

The story concludes with Dr. Renwick, who has been seeing Mary, taking her away with him to marry her.

<doc id="255408" wikidata="Q103813094" url="?curid=255408" title="Parrotbill">
<text>The parrotbills are a family, Paradoxornithidae, of passerine birds that are primarily native to East, Southeast and South Asia, with a single species in western North America, though feral populations exist elsewhere. They are generally small birds that inhabit reedbeds, forests and similar habitats. The traditional parrotbills feed mainly on seeds, e.g. of grasses, to which their robust bill, as the name implies, is well-adapted. Members of the family are usually non-migratory.

The bearded reedling or &quot;bearded tit&quot;, a Eurasian species formerly placed here, is more insectivorous by comparison, especially in summer. It also strikingly differs in morphology, such as its finer bill, and has again been moved to the monotypic family Panuridae. Conversely, a number of other mostly insectivorous species that traditionally were placed in Timaliidae (Old World babblers), for example the fulvettas and fire-tailed myzornis, along with the wrentit (a species with a conflicting taxonomic history), have been moved into Paradoxornithidae. DNA sequence data supports this.

Their general habitus and acrobatic habits resemble birds like the long-tailed tits. Together with these and others they were at some time placed in the titmouse family Paridae. Later studies found no justification to presume a close relationship between all these birds, and consequently the parrotbills and bearded reedling were removed from the tits and chickadees and placed into a distinct family. As names like &quot;Paradoxornis paradoxus&quot; – &quot;puzzling, paradox bird&quot; – suggest, their true relationships were very unclear, although by the latter 20th century they were generally seen as close to Timaliidae (Old World babblers) and Sylviidae (Old World warblers).

==Taxonomy==
Since 1990 (Sibley &amp; Ahlquist 1990), molecular data has been added to aid the efforts of discovering the parrotbills&#x27; true relationships. As &quot;Paradoxornis&quot; species are generally elusive and in many cases little-known birds, usually specimens of the bearded reedling which are far more easy to procure were used for the analyses. Often, the entire group was entirely left out of analyses, being small and seemingly insignificant in the large pattern of bird evolution (e.g. Barker &quot;et al.&quot; 2002, 2004). The bearded reedling tended to appear close to larks in phylogenies based on e.g. DNA-DNA hybridization (Sibley &amp; Ahlquist 1990), or on mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and nDNA &quot;c-myc&quot; exon 3, RAG-1 and myoglobin intron 2 sequence data (Ericson &amp; Johansson 2003). Placement in a superfamily Sylvioidea which contained birds such as Sylviidae, Timaliidae and long-tailed tits – but not Paridae – was confirmed.

Cibois (2003a) analyzed mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and 12S/16S rRNA sequences of some Sylvioidea, among them several species of &quot;Paradoxornis&quot; but not the bearded reedling. These formed a robust clade closer to the &quot;Sylvia&quot; typical warblers and some presumed &quot;Old World babblers&quot; such as &quot;Chrysomma sinense&quot; than to other birds. The puzzle was finally resolved by Alström &quot;et al.&quot; (2006), who studied mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and nDNA myoglobin intron 2 sequences of a wider range of Sylvioidea: The bearded reedling was not a parrotbill at all, but forms a distinct lineage on its own, the relationships of which are not entirely resolved at present. The parrotbills&#x27; presence in the clade containing &quot;Sylvia&quot;, on the other hand, necessitates that the Paradoxornithidae are placed in synonymy of the Sylviidae. Cibois (2003b) even suggested that these themselves were to be merged with the remaining Timaliidae and the latter name to be adopted. This has hitherto not been followed and researchers remain equivocal as many taxa in Sylviidae and Timaliidae remain to be tested for their relationships. In any case, it is most likely that the typical warbler-parrotbill group is monophyletic and therefore agrees with the modern requirements for a taxon. Hence, whether to keep or to synonymize it is entirely a matter of philosophy, as the scientific facts would agree with either approach.

The interesting conclusion from an evolutionary point of view is that the morphologically both internally homogenous and compared to each other highly dissimilar typical warblers and parrotbills form the two extremes in the divergent evolution of the Sylviidae. This is underscored by looking at the closest living relatives of the parrotbills in the rearranged Sylviidae: The genus &quot;Chrysomma&quot; are non-specialized species altogether intermediate in habitus, habitat and habits between the typical warblers and the parrotbills. Presumably, the ancestral sylviids looked much like these birds. How dramatic the evolutionary changes wrought upon the parrotbills in their adaptation to feeding on grass caryopses and similar seeds were can be seen by comparing them with the typical fulvettas, which were formerly considered Timaliidae and united with the alcippes (Pasquet 2006). These look somewhat like drab fairy-wrens and have none of the parrotbills&#x27; adaptations to food and habitat. Yet it appears that the typical fulvettas&#x27; and parrotbills&#x27; common ancestor evolved into at least two parrotbill lineages independently (Cibois 2003a) &amp; (Yeung et al. 2006). Only the wrentit, the only American sylviid, resembles the parrotbills much in habitus, though not in color pattern, and of course, as an insectivore, neither in bill shape.

The phylogenetic relationships between the Paradoxornithidae and other families was determined in a molecular phylogenetic study by Tianlong Cai and collaborators that was published in 2019. It is shown in the cladogram below:.
The cladogram below shows the relationships between the genera in the family Paradoxornithidae. It is based on the results of the molecular phylogenetic study by Tianlong Cai and collaborators and the generic divisions adopted by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker in the list of birds maintained on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee.
==Species==
There are 38 species of parrotbills and allies distributed among 9 genera. This list is presented according to the IOC taxonomic sequence and can also be sorted alphabetically by common name and binomial.

== Egg recognition ==
Parrotbill egg recognition is the ability of the parrotbill to distinguish its own eggs against the eggs of a brood parasite. Without their own eggs in the nest, parrotbills are not able to identify whether their nest has been intruded by the eggs of a brood parasite. Because the colour and number of eggs may vary, there are varying outcomes to whether parrotbills will reject or accept the eggs whether it be their own or if they are acting host for another species. Cognitive mechanisms including recognition by discordance and template-based recognition are hypothesized to be the manner in which a host&#x27;s eggs are identified. The common cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of parrotbills and the two have co-evolved together over time to promote the reproductive success of both species. The common cuckoo is an example of an avian brood parasite that reduces the energy cost of caring for its eggs by placing them in the parrotbill&#x27;s nest.

Depending on the parrotbill species, the eggs will either be maculate with spots or marks or immaculate, meaning without spots or marks. The cuckoo is also able to lay eggs that replicate the ones of its hosts in a means to have its eggs accepted by the host. Whether the parasitic eggs are accepted by the host is based on two hypothetical cognitive mechanisms. True or template-based recognition predicts that by learning or by instinct, the parrotbill would be able to reject the brood parasite eggs. If learned, the parrotbill would imprint on its own eggs and would be able to use it as a template to compare to foreign eggs. Recognition by discordancy is the least favoured hypothesis among scientists of the two mechanisms, but describes the action of rejecting the eggs which appear to be the minority whether it is their own eggs or the parasite&#x27;s eggs; it does not require learning or instinctive behaviour. Some studies have predicted discordancy is favoured as certain species demonstrate the behaviour at all life stages; if the behaviour is demonstrated at a young age, it may not be an example of learning as the time for learning could be too short.

One parrotbill species that has been studied is the ashy-throated parrotbill (&quot;Paradoxornis alphonsianus&quot;) and demonstrated the use of both mechanisms relaying there may not be one &quot;universal method&quot;. The eggs of the ashy-throated parrotbill are immaculate and polymorphic in which multiple phenotypic colours in that species is produced; its eggs are placed in competition with the eggs of the common cuckoo (&quot;Cuculus canorus&quot;). Typically, the female cuckoo lays its eggs in the nest of the parrotbill after taking out one of the host&#x27;s eggs. The immaculate colours in this species are blue, pale blue and white, but only one colour is present at a time and the female produces only one colour over its lifetime.

If parrotbills do not have their own eggs within the nest, it has been observed they accept the eggs of the avian brood parasite, as the &quot;cue&quot; of the presence of their own eggs has not been established. Time is also important for both male and female parrotbills as it can be the factor in whether the parrotbill will recognize parasitic eggs. For females, it is crucial they learn the egg phenotype as the eggs are being laid, but if this learning is not immediate, parasitic eggs can be accepted and imprinted. Males learn their respective egg phenotype once the clutch has reached completion.

In some species, male parrotbills also incubate eggs, and they are predicted to follow discordancy recognition for this behaviour as the males may encounter multiple egg types with different mates over time. This could lead to rejection of their own eggs based on previous knowledge of egg colour. A possible exception to this idea is if the host parrotbill produces eggs that are monomorphic. If male parrotbills do not imprint on their own eggs, they increase the probability of production of varied phenotypes of egg colour and patterns within the population.

If a host species is new to an area, it is suspected cuckoo parasitism will be favoured as recognition of parasitic eggs has not yet occurred. Over time, the two species co-evolve with the parrotbill first utilizing one of the hypothesized cognitive mechanisms in order to recognize parasitic eggs. In order to compensate for this new behaviour in parrotbills, the parasite produces eggs that are similar to those of the host and leads to the evolution of polymorphisms over time for both species.

<text>The New York City Police Department (NYPD), officially the City of New York Police Department, is the primary law enforcement agency within New York City. Established on May 23, 1845, the NYPD is the largest, and one of the oldest, municipal police departments in the United States.

The NYPD is headquartered at 1 Police Plaza, located on Park Row in Lower Manhattan near City Hall. The NYPD&#x27;s regulations are compiled in title 38 of the &quot;New York City Rules&quot;. Dedicated units of the NYPD include the Emergency Service Unit, K-9, harbor patrol, highway patrol, air support, bomb squad, counterterrorism, criminal intelligence, anti-organized crime, narcotics, mounted patrol, public transportation, and public housing units.

The NYPD employs over 40,000 people, including more than 30,000 uniformed officers as of September 2023. According to the official CompStat database, the NYPD responded to nearly 500,000 reports of crime and made over 200,000 arrests during 2019. In 2020, it had a budget of . However, the NYPD&#x27;s actual spending often exceeds its budget.

The NYPD has a history of police brutality, corruption, and misconduct, which critics argue persists till the present day. Due to its high-profile location in New York City, the largest city and media center in the U.S., fictionalized versions of the NYPD and its officers have frequently been portrayed in novels, radio, television, motion pictures, and video games.

==History==
The Municipal Police were established in 1845, replacing an old night watch system. Mayor William Havemeyer shepherded the NYPD together. The NYPD appointed its first Black officer in 1911 and the first female officer in 1918.
During Richard Enright&#x27;s tenure as commissioner, the country&#x27;s first Shomrim Society, a fraternal organization of Jewish police officers, was founded in the NYPD in 1924. At the time, NYPD had 700 Jewish officers on the force. 

In 1961, highly decorated NYPD officer Mario Biaggi, later a US Congressman, became the first police officer in New York State to be made a member of the National Police Officers Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, the NYPD began to police street-level drug markets much more intensively, leading to a sharp increase in incarceration.

in 1992, Mayor David Dinkins created an independent Civilian Complaint Review Board for the NYPD. In response to this, some NYPD officers violently protested and rioted. They blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge, demonstrated at City Hall and shouted racial epithets. The protests were sponsored by the NYPD union.

In 1994, the NYPD developed the CompStat computer system for tracking crime geographically, which is now in use by other police departments in the United States and Canada. Research is mixed on whether CompStat had an impact on crime rates. Throughout the mid to late 1990s, several mergers took place which changed the landscape of policing in New York City. The New York City Transit Police and the New York City Housing Authority Police Department merged into the NYPD in 1995, becoming the Transit Bureau and Housing Bureau respectively. In 1996, the New York City Department of Transportation&#x27;s Traffic Operations Bureau was merged into the NYPD, becoming the Transportation Bureau. In 1998, the New York City Department of Education&#x27;s School Safety Division became part of the NYPD&#x27;s Community Affairs Bureau.

In 2021, the NYPD ceased enforcement of marijuana crimes other than driving under the influence.

In 2024, the NYPD changed its motto from &quot;Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect&quot; to &quot;Fighting Crime, Protecting the Public&quot;.

==Organization and structure==
The department is administered and governed by the police commissioner, who is appointed by the mayor. Technically, the Commissioner serves a five-year term; as a practical matter, they serve at the mayor&#x27;s pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints the first deputy commissioner, numerous deputy commissioners, and the Chief of Department (the most senior uniformed officer). By default, the commissioner and their subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not sworn officers. However, a commissioner who comes up from the sworn ranks retains the status and statutory powers of a police officer while serving as commissioner. This affects their police pensions, and their ability to carry a firearm without a pistol permit. Some police commissioners carry a personal firearm but also have a full-time security detail. Commissioners and deputy commissioners are administrators who specialize in areas of great importance to the Department, such as counterterrorism, support services, public information, legal matters, intelligence, and information technology. However, as civilian administrators, deputy commissioners are prohibited from taking operational control of a police situation (the commissioner and the first deputy commissioner may take control of these situations, however). Within the rank structure, there are also designations, known as &quot;grades&quot;, that connote differences in duties, experience, and pay. However, supervisory functions are generally reserved for the rank of sergeant and above.

===Office of the Chief of Department===
The Chief of Department serves as the senior sworn member of the NYPD which before 1987 was known as the chief of operations and before that as chief inspector. John Chell currently serves as Chief of Department.

===Bureaus===

The department is divided into 20 bureaus which are typically commanded by a uniformed bureau chief (such as the chief of patrol and the chief of housing) or a civilian deputy commissioner (such as the Deputy Commissioner of Information Technology). The bureaus fit under four umbrellas: Patrol, Transit &amp; Housing, Investigative, and Administrative. Bureaus are often subdivided into smaller divisions and units. All deputy commissioners report directly to the Commissioner and bureau chiefs report to the Commissioner through the Chief of Department.

==Rank structure==

Officers graduate from the Police Academy after five and a half to six months (or sometimes more) of training in various academic, physical, and tactical fields. For the first 18 months of their careers, they are designated as &quot;Probationary Police Officers&quot;, or more informally, &quot;rookies&quot;. There are three career &quot;tracks&quot; in the NYPD: supervisory, investigative, and specialist. The supervisory track consists of nine ranks; promotion to the ranks of sergeant, lieutenant, and captain are made via competitive civil service examinations. After reaching the rank of captain, promotion to the ranks of deputy inspector, inspector, deputy chief, assistant chief, (bureau) chief, and chief of department is always at the discretion of the NYPD commissioner. Promotion from the rank of police officer to detective is discretionary by the police commissioner or required by law when the officer has performed outstanding investigative duty for eighteen months or more.

===Badges===
Badges in the New York City Police Department are referred to as &quot;shields&quot; (the traditional term), though not all badge designs are strictly shield-shaped. Some officers have used &quot;Pottsy&quot; badges, &quot;dupes&quot;, or duplicate badges, as officers are punished for losing their shield by also losing up to ten days&#x27; pay.

Every rank has a different badge design (except &quot;police officer&quot; and &quot;probationary police officer&quot;) and, upon change in rank, officers receive a new badge. Lower-ranked police officers are identified by their shield numbers, and tax registry numbers. Lieutenants and above do not have shield numbers and are identified by tax registry numbers. All sworn members of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a red background. Civilian employees of the NYPD have their ID card photos taken against a blue background, signifying that they are not commissioned to carry a firearm. All ID cards have an expiration date. Although the First Deputy Commissioner and Chief of Department share the same insignia (four stars), the First Deputy Commissioner outranks the Chief of Department. The Deputy Commissioners, Bureau Chiefs/Bureau Chief Chaplains and Chief Surgeon have three stars.


== Department composition ==
As of October 2023, the NYPD&#x27;s current authorized uniformed strength is 33,536. There are also 19,454 civilian employees, including approximately 3,500 traffic enforcement agents, 4,500 auxiliary police officers, and 5,500 school safety agents, are presently employed by the department as well as being deployed on the streets. The Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York (NYC PBA), the largest municipal police union in the United States, represents over 50,000 active and retired police officers.

The entire police force in 2023: 47% are white and 53% are members of minority groups. 

Of 21,603 officers on patrol:
*43% are non-Hispanic white
*57% are black, Latino (of any race), or Asian or Asian-American.
Of 5,164 detectives:
*52% are non-Hispanic white
*48% are black, Latino (of any race), or Asian or Asian-American.
Of 4,376 sergeants:
*52% are non-Hispanic white
*48% are black, Latino (of any race), or Asian or Asian-American.
Of 1,635 lieutenants:
*59% are non-Hispanic white
*41% are black, Latino (of any race), or Asian or Asian-American.
Of 360 captains: 
*62% are non-Hispanic white
*38% are black, Latino (of any race), or Asian or Asian-American.
Of 101 police chiefs: 
*57% are non-Hispanic white and
*43% are non-white.

===Place of residence===

As a rule, NYPD officers can reside in New York City as well as Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Suffolk and Nassau counties and approximately half of them live outside the city (51% in 2020, up from 42% in 2016).

===Women in the NYPD===

On January 1, 2022, Keechant Sewell became the first woman to serve as the NYPD Commissioner. Juanita N. Holmes, appointed Chief of the Patrol Bureau in 2020, was the first black woman to hold this command and at the time of her appointment, was the highest-ranked uniformed woman in the NYPD. On June 12, 2023, Sewell announced that she was stepping down as commissioner. No reason was given for her departure.

On November 25, 2024, Mayor Eric Adams appointed Jessica Tisch as the NYPD Commissioner. She is the second woman to serve in the job.

==Line of duty deaths==
The NYPD has lost 932 officers in the line of duty since 1849. This figure includes officers from agencies that were later absorbed by or became a part of the modern NYPD, in addition to the NYPD itself. This number also includes 28 officers killed on and off duty by gunfire of other officers on duty. Gunfire from adversaries has resulted in the deaths of 286 officers. The NYPD lost 23 officers in the September 11, 2001 attacks, not including another 247 who later died of 9/11-related illnesses. The NYPD has more line-of-duty deaths than any other American law enforcement agency.

== Services ==
The NYPD has a broad array of specialized services, including the Emergency Service Unit, K9, harbor patrol, air support, bomb squad, counter-terrorism, criminal intelligence, anti-gang, anti-organized crime, narcotics, public transportation, and public housing units. The NYPD Intelligence Division &amp; Counter-Terrorism Bureau has officers stationed in eleven cities internationally.

In 2019 the NYPD responded to 482,337 reports of crime and made 214,617 arrests. There were 95,606 major felonies reported in 2019, compared to over half a million per year when crime in New York City peaked during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s.

==Public opinions==

The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute has been regularly measuring public opinion of the NYPD since 1997 when just under 50% of the public approved of the job the NYPD was doing. Approval peaked at 78% in 2002 following the World Trade Center terrorist attacks in September 2001, and has ranged between 52 and 72% since. Approval varies by race/ethnicity, with black and Hispanic respondents consistently less likely to say they approve of the job the NYPD is doing than whites.

In 2017, the Quinnipiac poll found that New York City voters approve of the way NYPD, in general, does its job by a margin of 67–25%. Approval was 79–15 percent among white voters, 52–37 percent among black voters, and 73–24 percent among Hispanic voters. 86% of voters said crime is a serious problem, 71% said police brutality is a serious problem and 61% said police corruption is a serious problem.

A 2020 poll commissioned by Manhattan Institute for Policy Research reported that the public approved of the NYPD 53% to 40% against, again with strong racial differences: 59% of whites and Asians approved, as did 51% of Hispanics, whereas 51% of black residents disapproved.

==Brutality, corruption, and misconduct cases==

The NYPD has a long history of police brutality, corruption, and misconduct as well as discrimination based on gender, race, and religion. Critics, including from within the NYPD, have accused the NYPD of manipulating crime statistics. In 2009, NYPD officer Adrian Schoolcraft was arrested, abducted by his fellow officers and involuntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital after he provided evidence of manipulation of crime statistics (intentional under reporting of crimes) and intentional wrongful arrests (to meet arrest quotas). He filed a federal suit against the department, which the city settled before trial in 2015, also giving him back pay for the period when he was suspended.

The Knapp Commission found in 1970 that the NYPD had systematic corruption problems. The Civilian Complaint Review Board is a civilian-led 13-member panel tasked with investigating misconduct or lesser abuse accusations against NYPD officers, including abuse of authority, discourtesy, excessive use-of-force, and offensive language. Complaints against officers may be filed online, by mail, by phone, or in person at any NYPD station. On June 8, 2020, both houses of the New York state assembly passed the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, which provides that any police officer in the state of New York who injures or kills somebody through the use of &quot;a chokehold or similar restraint&quot; can be charged with a class C felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the police reforms into law on June 12, 2020, which he described as &quot;long overdue&quot;.

In 2020 during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, many NYPD officers refused to wear face masks while policing protests related to racial injustice, contrary to the recommendations of health experts and authorities. During the George Floyd protests, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that more than 60 videos showed NYPD police attacking protesters, many of whom were attacked without cause. Included in these attacks were the &#x27;kettling&#x27; of protesters, an officer removing the mask of a protester and pepper spraying him, and an incident where police vehicles were driven into a crowd. An investigation by New York City&#x27;s Department of Investigation concluded that the NYPD had exercised excessive force during the George Floyd protests.

In 2024, the NYPD tossed out more than 400 civilian complaints about police misconduct without reviewing the evidence. All of the cases had been investigated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board. In March, NYPD commissioner Edward Caban said that the force had exceeded its overtime budget by $100 million, spending $2.5 million a week on overtime alone amid political demonstrations throughout the city and increased deployments in the subway system. Police overtime spending went from $4 million in 2022 to $155 million in 2023. In September, the NYPD was also accused of extorting a Brooklyn bar owner. The owner said that associate director Ray Martin of the mayor&#x27;s Office of Entertainment and Nightlife told him that he could pay Commissioner Caban&#x27;s brother for better treatment from police. Caban resigned his commission shortly after, following a federal investigation into the NYPD&#x27;s nightclub enforcement. Three days before resigning, Caban watered down the NYPD&#x27;s misconduct rules, reducing penalties for officers &quot;guilty of abusing authority, using offensive language, failing to take a civilian complaint, and conducting an unlawful search.&quot; The NYPD has been persistently criticized by safe streets community advocates for endangering cyclists by parking their vehicles in bike lanes, and for misapplying the law when ticketing cyclists riding outside blocked bike lanes. According to a 2021 &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis, New York City spent at least an average of US$170 million annually in settlements related to police misconduct over ten years.

In December 2024, the Chief of Internal Affairs, Miguel Iglesias, was forced out amid criticism of his handling of sexual abuse allegations against former Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, prompting a leadership shake-up and a department-wide personnel review.

==Technology==
In the 1990s the department developed a &quot;CompStat&quot; system of management which has also since been established in other cities. The NYPD has extensive crime scene investigation and laboratory resources, as well as units that assist with computer crime investigations. In 2005, the NYPD established a &quot;Real Time Crime Center&quot; to assist in investigations; This is essentially a searchable database that pulls information from departmental records, including traffic tickets, court summonses, and previous complaints to reports, as well as arrest reports. The database contains files to identify individuals based on tattoos, body marks, teeth, and skin conditions, based on police records.

NYPD also maintains the Domain Awareness System, a network that provides information and analytics to police, drawn from a variety of sources, including a network of 9,000 publicly and privately owned license plate readers, surveillance cameras, shotspotter data, NYPD databases, radiation, and chemical sensors. The Domain Awareness System of surveillance was developed as part of Lower Manhattan Security Initiative in a partnership between the NYPD and Microsoft. It allows the NYPD to track surveillance targets and gain detailed information about them. It also has access to data from at least 2 billion license plate readings, 100 million summonses, 54 million 911 calls, 15 million complaints, 12 million detective reports, 11 million arrests, and 2 million warrants. The 9,000 CCTV cameras consist of data text records that will be kept for 30 days. The system is connected to 9,000 video cameras across New York City.

In 2020, the NYPD deployed a robotic dog, known as Digidog, manufactured by Boston Dynamics. The robotic dog has cameras which send back real-time footage along with lights and two-way communication, and it is able to navigate on its own using artificial intelligence. Reaction by locals to Digidog was mixed. Deployment of Digidog led to condemnation from the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and the American Civil Liberties Union due to privacy concerns. In response to its deployment, a city council member has proposed a law banning armed robots; this would not apply to Digidog as Digidog is not armed and Boston Dynamics prohibits arming its robots. On April 24, 2021, U.S. Representative Ritchie Torres proposed new federal legislation requiring police departments receiving federal funds to report use of surveillance technology to the Department of Homeland Security and Congress. The NYPD states that the robot is meant for hostage, terrorism, bomb threat, and hazardous material situations, and that it was properly disclosed to the public under current law. Following continued pushback against Digidog, including opposition to the system&#x27;s $94,000 price tag, the NYPD announced on April 28, 2021, that its lease would be terminated. In April 2023, Mayor Eric Adams announced the revival of the Digidog program in a reversal of his predecessor Bill de Blasio, saying &quot;Digidog is out of the pound.&quot; Two robots were purchased at that time for a total of $750,000 using funds from asset forfeiture.

== Vehicles ==
NYPD [[Dodge Charger (LX/LD)|Dodge Charger]]
==Firearms==

New NYPD officers are allowed to choose from one of two 9mm service pistols: the Glock 17 Gen4 and Glock 19 Gen4. All duty handguns were previously modified to a 12-pound (53 N) NY-2 trigger pull, though recruits were being issued handguns with a lighter trigger pull as of 2021.

The Smith &amp; Wesson 5946 semi-automatic 9mm with a double action only (DAO) trigger, was issued to recruits in the past; however, the pistol has been discontinued. While it is no longer an option for new hires, officers who were issued the weapon may continue to use it. Shotgun-certified officers were authorized to carry Ithaca 37 shotguns, which are being phased out in favor of the newer Mossberg 590. Officers and detectives belonging to the NYPD&#x27;s Emergency Service Unit, Counter-terrorism Bureau and Strategic Response Group are armed with a range of select-fire weapons and long guns, such as the Colt M4A1 carbine and similar-pattern Colt AR-15 rifles, Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the Remington Model 700 bolt-action rifle. NYPD ESU Officers also use the Ruger Mini 14 556 rifle. 

=== Discontinued weapons ===
From 1926 until 1986 the standard weapons of the department were the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 and the Colt Official Police .38 Special revolvers with four-inch barrels. Female officers had the option to choose to carry a three-inch barrel revolver instead of the normal four-inch model due to its lighter weight. Before 1994, the standard weapon of the NYPD was the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 64 DAO, a .38 Special revolver with a three- or four-inch barrel, and the Ruger Police Service-Six with a four-inch barrel. This type of revolver was called the Model NY-1 by the department. After the switch in 1994 to semi-automatic pistols, officers who privately purchased revolvers before January 1, 1994, were allowed to use them for duty use until August 31, 2018. They were grandfathered in as approved off-duty guns. Before the issuing of the 9mm semi-automatic pistol NYPD detectives and plainclothes officers often carried the Colt Detective Special and/or the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36 &quot;Chief&#x27;s Special&quot; .38 Special caliber snub-nosed (two-inch) barrel revolvers for their ease of concealment while dressed in civilian clothes. The Kahr K9 9mm pistol was an approved off-duty/backup weapon from 1998 to 2011. It was pulled from service because it could not be modified to a 12-pound trigger pull.

==Affiliations==
The NYPD is affiliated with the New York City Police Foundation and the New York City Police Museum. It also runs a Youth Police academy to provide a positive interaction with police officers and to educate young people about the challenges and responsibilities of police work. The NYPD additionally sponsors a Law Enforcement Explorer Program through Scouting America (formerly the Boy Scouts of America). The department also operates the Citizens Police Academy, which educates the public on basic law and policing procedures.

<text>The New World barbets are a family, Capitonidae, of 15 birds in the order Piciformes, which inhabit humid forests in Central and South America. They are closely related to the toucans.

The New World barbets are plump birds, with short necks and large heads. They get their name from the bristles that fringe their heavy bills. Most species are brightly coloured and live in tropical forest.

These barbets are mostly arboreal birds, which nest in tree holes dug by breeding pairs, laying two to four eggs. They eat fruit and insects. These birds do not migrate.

==Taxonomy==

Fossil New World barbets have been found dating from the Miocene in Florida. The closest relatives of the barbets are the toucans, and these two families are also closely related to the honeyguides and woodpeckers (with which they form the order Piciformes).

Formerly, the barbets have been treated as one family. This has turned out to be paraphyletic, though, with regard to toucans; thus, only the New World true barbets are retained in the Capitonidae. The African barbets (Lybiidae) and the Asian barbets (Megalaimidae), as well as the two toucan-barbets from the Americas (Semnornithidae) are currently split from this family. Alternatively, the toucans, which evolved from a common ancestor shared with the American barbets, might be included in the traditional all-encompassing barbet family. As they have evolved characteristics that are unique to themselves, they are usually treated separately, thus the barbets are split up according to the four lineages.

The phylogenetic relationship between the New World barbets and the eight other families in the order Piciformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

==Ecology==
While most New World barbet species inhabit lowland forest, some range into montane and temperate forests, as well. Most are restricted to habitats containing trees with dead wood, which are used for nesting.

The diet of barbets is mixed, with fruit being the dominant part. Small prey items are also taken, especially when nesting. Barbets are capable of shifting their diet quickly in the face of changing food availability. Numerous species of fruiting trees and bushes are visited; an individual barbet may feed on as many as 60 different species in its range. They also visit plantations and take cultivated fruit and vegetables. Fruit is eaten whole, and indigestible material such as seed pits is regurgitated later (often before singing). Regurgitation does not usually happen in the nest (as happens with toucans). Like their relatives, New World barbets are thought to be important agents in seed dispersal in tropical forests.

As well as taking fruit, they also take arthropod prey, gleaned from the branches and trunks of trees. A wide range of insects is taken, including ants, beetles, and moths. Scorpions and centipedes are also taken, and a few species take small vertebrates such as frogs.

==Relationship with humans==
New World barbets have little direct impact on humans. The loss of forest can have a deleterious effect on barbet species dependent on old growth, to the benefit of species that favor more disturbed or open habitat.

Three species of New World barbets are listed as threatened by the IUCN: The white-mantled barbet of Colombia is listed as endangered and the five-coloured barbet as vulnerable, the two having a relatively small range threatened by deforestation for the timber industry and to create space for agriculture (including coca and marijuana) and livestock, and mining. The quite recently discovered scarlet-banded barbet of Peru is considered vulnerable due to its small population size (estimated at under 1000 birds), although its remote habitat is not immediately threatened.

<text>Commuting is periodically recurring travel between a place of residence and place of work or study, where the traveler, referred to as a commuter, leaves the boundary of their home community. By extension, it can sometimes be any regular or often repeated travel between locations, even when not work-related. The modes of travel, time taken and distance traveled in commuting varies widely across the globe. Most people in least-developed countries continue to walk to work. The cheapest method of commuting after walking is usually by bicycle, so this is common in low-income countries but is also increasingly practised by people in wealthier countries for environmental, health, and often time reasons. In middle-income countries, motorcycle commuting is very common. 

The next technology adopted as countries develop is more dependent on location: in more populous, older cities, especially in Eurasia mass transit (rail, bus, etc.) predominates, while in smaller, younger cities, and large parts of North America and Australasia, commuting by personal automobile is more common. A small number of very wealthy people, and those working in remote locations around the world, also commute by air travel, often for a week or more at a time rather than the more typical daily commute. Transportation links that enable commuting also impact the physical layout of cities and regions, allowing a distinction to arise between mostly-residential suburbs and the more economically focused urban core of a city (process known as suburban sprawl), but the specifics of how that distinction is realized remain drastically different between societies, with Eurasian &quot;suburbs&quot; often being more densely populated than North American &quot;urban cores&quot;.

== History ==

The first separation between workplace and place of residence occurred as a result of the invention of the steam railway. The word &quot;commuter&quot; derives from the early days of rail travel in US cities, such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Chicago, where, in the 1840s, the railways engendered suburbs from which travelers paid a reduced or &#x27;commuted&#x27; fare into the city. Later, the back formations &quot;commute&quot; and &quot;commuter&quot; were coined therefrom. Commuted tickets would usually allow the traveler to repeat the same journey as often as they liked during the period of validity: normally, the longer the period the cheaper the cost per day.

Before the 19th century, most workers lived less than an hour&#x27;s walk from their work. The Industrial Revolution brought specialization of work and workplaces, and relocated most paid work from households and rural areas to factories in urban areas. Today, many people travel daily to work a long way from their own towns, cities, and villages, especially in industrialised societies. Depending on factors such as the high cost of housing in city centres, lack of public transit, and traffic congestion, modes of travel may include automobiles, motorcycles, trains, aircraft, buses, and bicycles. Where Los Angeles is infamous for its automobile gridlock, commuting in New York is closely associated with the subway; in London and Tokyo and several European cities, &quot;commuter&quot; is automatically associated with rail passengers. In the near future there may be another move away from the traditional &quot;commute&quot; with the introduction of flexible working. Some have suggested that many employees would be far more productive and live healthier, stress-free lives if the daily commute is removed completely.

=== Suburbs ===

Commuting has had a large impact on modern life. It has allowed cities to grow to sizes that were previously not practical, and it has led to the proliferation of suburbs. Many large cities or conurbations are surrounded by commuter belts, also known as metropolitan areas, commuter towns, dormitory towns, or bedroom communities. The prototypical commuter lives in one of these areas and travels daily to work or to school in the core city.

As urban sprawl pushes further and further away from central business districts, new businesses can appear in outlying cities, leading to the existence of the reverse commuter who lives in a core city but works in the suburbs, and to a type of secondary commuter who lives in a more distant exurb and works in the outlying city or industrial suburb.

==Gender differences==
A UK study, published in 2009, found that on average women suffer four times as much psychological stress from their work commute as men do. An Indian study conducted in Mangalore led by Edmond Fernandes stated that creating a gender sensitive commuter-centric road safety policy requires to be developed to protect women while commuting as they felt stressed and scared to travel alone, particularly at night. 

== Education ==
Institutions that have few dormitories or low or no student housing populations are called &quot;commuter schools&quot; in the United States, like community colleges.

== Traffic ==

Most commuters travel at the same time of day, resulting in the morning and evening rush hours, with congestion on roads and public transport systems not designed or maintained well enough to cope with the peak demands. As an example, Interstate 405 located in Southern California is one of the busiest freeways in the United States. Commuters may sit up to two hours in traffic during rush hour. Construction work or collisions on the freeway distract and slow down commuters, contributing to even longer delays.

== Pollution ==
Cars carrying only one occupant use fuel and roads less efficiently than shared cars or public transport, and increase traffic congestion. Commuting by car is a major factor contributing to air pollution. Carpool lanes can help commuters reach their destinations more quickly, encourage people to socialize, and spend time together, while reducing air pollution. Some governments and employers have introduced employee travel reduction programs that encourage such alternatives as carpooling and remote work. Some are also carpooling using Internet sites to save money. Alternatives like personal rapid transit have also been proposed to reap the energy-efficiency benefits of a mass transit system while maintaining the speed and convenience of individual transport.

Traffic emissions, such as from cars and trucks, also contribute. Airborne by-products from vehicle exhaust systems cause air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities. The major culprits from transportation sources are carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO and NOx), volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the main components of petroleum fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel. These molecules react with sunlight, heat, ammonia, moisture, and other compounds to form the noxious vapours, ground level ozone, and particles that comprise smog.

==Social trends==
===Commuting trends in the United States===

In the United States, the Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey (ACS) collects data on commuting times, allowing an analysis of average commute time by industry, location, and vehicle. According to the 2014 ACS, the average commute time for adults in the United States was 26.8 minutes.

The occupations with the longest commutes were Construction and Mining (33.4 minutes), Computer Science and Math (31.8), and Business Operations Specialists (30.2), while those in the military had the shortest commute (21). In general, urban and suburban workers in the US have similar commute times (about 30 minutes), while rural workers have significantly shorter commutes (22.6 minutes).

In the US, over 90% of workers commute by car, while about 5% commute by public transportation. Statistical models indicate that in addition to demographics and work duration, commute time is one of the most important determinants of discretionary time allocation by individuals.

=== Commuting College Students ===
The number of students who commute to college continues to increase significantly as the years go by. From 1996 to 2006 alone, the percentage of undergraduate students who commuted to campus began to increase at a rate of 30% to 50%. 

In a study involving 10 universities in Canada, 61% of students reported that their commute was a challenge to campus participation, while 30% perceived it as a barrier to academic success. Factors influencing satisfaction included commute mode, duration, travel attitudes, and campus type. Notably, 72% of students had one-way commutes of one hour or less, 22% had commutes lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, and 9% faced commutes exceeding 90 minutes.

=== Commuting and the scarcity of local employment ===

Commuting is often made necessary due to local employment market factors which may stem from the decline of manufacturing (i.e., in cities where large manufacturing employers have either closed or laid off workers, with no other employers to absorb that loss) and, in general, the sheer lack of local employment. More specifically, wages from local employers are often insufficient for a worker household to sustain itself. As a result, the needs of worker households must be sustained and this leads to a wider field of job search beyond a local area to the next nearest city or metropolitan area, resulting in the requirement for commuting. Hence, in areas where little or no transit options exist that can facilitate a journey to work to meet the requirements of a worker schedule, the use of a car is therefore made necessary. This is a personal choice driven by financial need, highlighting the broader issue of sustaining local economies.

===Social and health implications of commuting===

Since commuting largely stems from a need to travel outside a home community to sustain a household income while facing a bleak local employment market, this comes with additional social and health implications. First, there is the increased risk of injury and accident while driving as distance and time in the vehicle increases, which is generally observed when operating a vehicle. Fatigue and hazardous road conditions add to this risk. Second, while income from employment is greater in other cities, stress from commuting factors become a factor for personal health. Ironically, stress from having to locate employment or being placed in a low-income situation might lead to a similar outcome. However, this is dichotomous with the satisfaction of a sustainable income and good employment, which is clearly the goal of an individual who is faced with commuting.

<doc id="255432" wikidata="Q214137" url="?curid=255432" title="Honeyguide">
<text>Honeyguides (family Indicatoridae) are a family of birds in the order Piciformes. They are also known as indicator birds, or honey birds, although the latter term is also used more narrowly to refer to species of the genus &quot;Prodotiscus&quot;. They have an Old World tropical distribution, with the greatest number of species in Africa and two in Asia. These birds are best known for their interaction with humans. Honeyguides are noted and named for one or two species that will deliberately lead humans (but, contrary to popular claims, most likely not honey badgers) directly to bee colonies, so that they can feast on the grubs and beeswax that are left behind.

==Taxonomy==
The Indicatoridae were noted for their barbet-like structure and brood-parasitic behavior and morphologically considered unique among the non-passerines in having nine primaries. The phylogenetic relationship between the honeyguides and the eight other families that make up the order Piciformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
== Description ==
Most honeyguides are dull-colored, though some have bright yellow coloring in the plumage. All have light outer tail feathers, which are white in all the African species. The smallest species by body mass appears to be the green-backed honeyguide, at an average of , and by length appears to be the Cassin&#x27;s honeyguide, at an average of , while the largest species by weight is the lyre-tailed honeyguide, at , and by length, is the greater honeyguide, at .

They are among the few birds that feed regularly on wax—beeswax in most species, and presumably the waxy secretions of scale insects in the genus &quot;Prodotiscus&quot; and to a lesser extent in &quot;Melignomon&quot; and the smaller species of &quot;Indicator&quot;. They also feed on waxworms which are the larvae of the waxmoth &quot;Galleria mellonella&quot;, on bee colonies, and on flying and crawling insects, spiders, and occasional fruits. Many species join mixed-species feeding flocks.

==Behavior==
===Guiding===

Honeyguides are named for a remarkable habit seen in one or two species: guiding humans to bee colonies. Once the hive is open and the honey is taken, the bird feeds on larvae and wax. This behavior has been studied in the greater honeyguide; some authorities (following Friedmann, 1955) state that it also occurs in the scaly-throated honeyguide, while others disagree. Wild honeyguides understand various types of human calls that attract them to engage in the foraging mutualism. In northern Tanzania, honeyguides partner with Hadza hunter-gatherers, and the bird assistance has been shown to increase honey-hunters&#x27; rates of finding bee colonies by 560%, and led men to significantly higher yielding nests than those found without honeyguides. Contrary to most depictions of the human-honeyguide relationship, the Hadza did not actively repay honeyguides, but instead, hid, buried, and burned honeycomb, with the intent of keeping the bird hungry and thus more likely to guide again. Some experts believe that honeyguide co-evolution with humans goes back to the stone-tool making human ancestor &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, about 1.9million years ago. Despite popular belief, no evidence indicates that honeyguides guide the honey badger; though videos about this exist, there have been accusations that they were staged.

Although most members of the family are not known to recruit &quot;followers&quot; in their quest for wax, they are also referred to as &quot;honeyguides&quot; by linguistic extrapolation.

===Breeding===

The breeding behavior of eight species in &quot;Indicator&quot; and &quot;Prodotiscus&quot; is known. They are all brood parasites that lay one egg in a nest of another species, laying eggs in series of about five during a period of 5–7 days. Most favor hole-nesting species, often the related barbets and woodpeckers, but &quot;Prodotiscus&quot; parasitizes cup-nesters such as white-eyes and warblers. Honeyguide nestlings have been known to physically eject their hosts&#x27; chicks from the nests and they have needle-sharp hooks on their beaks with which they puncture the hosts&#x27; eggs or kill the nestlings.

African honeyguide birds are known to lay their eggs in underground nests of other bee-eating bird species. The honeyguide chicks kill the hatchlings of the host using their needle-sharp beaks just after hatching, much as cuckoo hatchlings do. The honeyguide mother ensures her chick hatches first by internally incubating the egg for an extra day before laying it, so that it has a head start in development compared to the hosts&#x27; offspring.

<text>Defenders of the Faith is the ninth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 13 January 1984 in the US and on 20 January 1984 in the UK. The album was certified platinum by the RIAA, and spawned the singles &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot;, &quot;Some Heads Are Gonna Roll&quot;, and &quot;Love Bites&quot;.

== Recording and release ==
&quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; was recorded at Ibiza Sound Studios, Ibiza, Spain, and mixed at DB Recording Studios and Bayshore Recording Studios in Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida. The LP and cassette tape were released on 13 January 1984, and the album appeared on CD in July. A remastered CD was released in May 2001. Simultaneously with the album&#x27;s release, the band kicked off their tour in Europe, with the bulk of concerts taking place in North America during the spring and summer.

Stylistically, &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; did not greatly depart from its predecessor and featured a similar formula of short, up-tempo metal anthems with stadium shout-along choruses, although progressive elements returned on some tracks such as &quot;The Sentinel&quot;. The track &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot; is actually a re-working of a track entitled &quot;Fight for Your Life&quot;, recorded during the 1982 &quot;Screaming For Vengeance&quot; sessions but not included on that album.

The album was an immediate success, only going one spot below &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; on the US Billboard 100 Albums Chart. Some critics nonetheless objected to the lack of a standout single comparable to &quot;Breaking the Law&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Another Thing Comin&#x27;, and the album&#x27;s general similarity to &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;.

The 30th-anniversary release of the album (released in March 2015) came with a double CD of a live show recorded on 5 May 1984 at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California on their Defenders of the Faith Tour and was originally recorded for a radio broadcast.

== Packaging ==
The cover art by Doug Johnson (who also designed the Hellion in &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;) depicts the Metallian, a horned, tiger-like land assault creature with Gatling guns and tank tracks conceptualized by the band. The back cover contains a message:

== Controversy ==
&quot;Eat Me Alive&quot; was listed at number 3 on the Parents Music Resource Center&#x27;s &quot;Filthy Fifteen&quot;, a list of 15 songs the organization found most objectionable. PMRC co-founder Tipper Gore stated the song was about oral sex at gunpoint. In response to the allegations, Priest recorded the song &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; on the follow-up album &quot;Turbo&quot;.

== Promotion ==
In December 1983, the band did a short tour playing dates in the UK and Germany introducing new single &quot;Freewheel Burning&quot; in the set. In January 1984, the band embarked on the Metal Conqueror Tour across Europe, North America and Japan. On this tour, the band played every song from the album live, with the exception of &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot;. During the band&#x27;s 2008 tour in support of &quot;Nostradamus&quot;, they played many songs which had never been played live before, one of them being &quot;Eat Me Alive&quot;. To date, this made &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; the second Judas Priest album from which every song had been played live (the first being &quot;Rocka Rolla&quot;), followed by &quot;British Steel&quot; during the 2009, British Steel 30th anniversary tour. By the end of 1984, &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; sold more than 800,000 copies worldwide.

<text>The Masters and Johnson research team, composed of William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson, pioneered research into the nature of human sexual response and the diagnosis and treatment of sexual disorders and dysfunctions from 1957 until the 1990s.

The work of Masters and Johnson began in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Washington University in St. Louis and was continued at the independent not-for-profit research institution they founded in St. Louis in 1964, originally called the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation and renamed the Masters and Johnson Institute in 1978.

In the initial phase of Masters and Johnson&#x27;s studies, from 1957 until 1965, they recorded some of the first laboratory data on the anatomy and physiology of human sexual response based on direct observation of 382 women and 312 men in what they conservatively estimated to be &quot;10,000 complete cycles of sexual response&quot;. Their findings, particularly on the nature of female sexual arousal (for example, describing the mechanisms of vaginal lubrication and debunking the earlier widely held notion that vaginal lubrication originated from the cervix) and orgasm (showing that the physiology of orgasmic response was identical whether stimulation was clitoral or vaginal, and, separately, proving that some women were capable of being multiorgasmic), dispelled many long-standing misconceptions.

They jointly wrote two classic texts in the field, &quot;Human Sexual Response&quot; and &quot;Human Sexual Inadequacy&quot;, published in 1966 and 1970 respectively. Both of these books were best-sellers and were translated into more than thirty languages. The team has been inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Additionally, they are the focus of a television series called &quot;Masters of Sex&quot; for Showtime based on the 2009 biography by author Thomas Maier.

==Research work==
Masters and Johnson met in 1957 when William Masters hired Virginia Johnson as a research assistant to undertake a comprehensive study of human sexuality. According to author Thomas Maier, as part of their clinical research Masters and Johnson observed paid volunteers engaging in sexual activity while hooked to wires in their lab. At Masters&#x27;s request, Masters and Johnson engaged in intercourse as subjects of their own study and eventually became lovers. Maier stated that Masters spent more time in the lab with Johnson than he did with his wife Libby and their children, and also spent summer vacations together with Johnson. By the time Masters divorced his first wife in 1971, associates believed that he and Johnson essentially lived together and worked and traveled together seven days a week. Masters and Johnson married in 1971 but then later divorced on March 18, 1993, in the Circuit Court of St. Louis County; they nonetheless continued to work together professionally.

Previously, the study of human sexuality (sexology) had been a largely neglected field of study due to the restrictive social conventions of the time, with prostitution as a notable exception.

Alfred Kinsey and colleagues at Indiana University had previously published two volumes on sexual behavior in the human male and female (known as the Kinsey Reports), in 1948 and 1953 respectively, both of which had been revolutionary and controversial in their time. Kinsey&#x27;s work, however, had mainly investigated the frequency with which certain behaviors occurred in the population and was based on personal interviews, not on laboratory observation. In contrast, Masters and Johnson set about to study the structure, psychology, and physiology of sexual behavior through observing and measuring masturbation and sexual intercourse in the laboratory.

Initially, participants used in their experiments were prostitutes. Masters and Johnson explained that they were a socially isolated group of people, they were knowledgeable about sex, and that they were willing to cooperate with the study. Of the 145 prostitutes who participated, only a select few were further evaluated for their genital anatomy and their physiological responses. In later studies, however, Masters and Johnson recruited 382 women and 312 men from the community. The vast majority of participants were white, had higher education levels, and most participants were married couples.

As well as recording some of the first physiological data from the human body and sex organs during sexual excitation, they also framed their findings and conclusions in language that espoused sex as a healthy and natural activity that could be enjoyed as a source of pleasure and intimacy.

The era in which their research was conducted permitted the use of methods that had not been attempted before, and that have not been attempted since: &quot;[M]en and women were designated as &#x27;assigned partners&#x27; and arbitrarily paired with each other to create &#x27;assigned couples&#x27;.&quot;

==Four-stage model of the sexual response==

One of the most enduring and important aspects of their work has been the four stage model of sexual response, which they described as the human sexual response cycle and defined as:
*Excitement phase (initial arousal)
*Plateau phase (at full arousal, but not yet at orgasm)
*Orgasm
*Resolution phase (after orgasm)

Their model shows no difference between Sigmund Freud&#x27;s purported categories of &quot;vaginal orgasm&quot; and &quot;clitoral orgasm&quot;: the physiological response was identical, even if the stimulation was in a different place.

Masters and Johnson&#x27;s findings also revealed that men undergo a refractory period following orgasm during which they are not able to ejaculate again, whereas there is no refractory period in women: this makes women capable of multiple orgasm. They also were the first to describe the phenomenon of the rhythmic contractions of orgasm in both sexes occurring initially in 0.8 second intervals and then gradually slowing in both speed and intensity.

==Sexual response in the aging person==
Masters and Johnson were the first to conduct research on the sexual responsiveness of older adults, finding that given a state of reasonably good health and the availability of an interested and interesting partner, there was no absolute age at which sexual abilities disappeared. While they noted that there were specific changes to the patterns of male and female sexual responses with aging – for example, it takes older men longer to become aroused and they typically require more direct genital stimulation, and the speed and amount of vaginal lubrication tends to diminish with age as well – they noted that many older men and women are perfectly capable of excitement and orgasm well into their seventies and beyond, a finding that has been confirmed in population-based epidemiological research on sexual function in the elderly.

==Laboratory comparison of homosexual male versus homosexual female sex==
Masters and Johnson randomly assigned two men into couples and two women into couples and then observed them having sex in the laboratory, at the Masters and Johnson Institute. They provided their observations in &quot;Homosexuality in Perspective:&quot;

According to Masters and Johnson, this pattern differed in the female homosexual couples:

==Sexual dysfunction==
Their research into the anatomy and physiology of sexual response was a springboard to developing a clinical approach to the treatment of sexual problems in a revolutionary manner. Prior to 1970, when they described their treatment program to the world for the first time, sexual dysfunctions such as premature ejaculation, impotence, vaginismus, and female frigidity had been generally treated by long-term (multi-year) psychotherapy or psychoanalysis with very low rates of success. Masters and Johnson revolutionized things by devising a form of rapid treatment (2 week) psychotherapy always involving a couple, rather than just an individual, working with a male-female therapist team that resulted in a success rate of more than 80%. This was strictly a talking therapy – couples in their sex therapy program were never observed in sexual activity.

==Treatment of homosexual behavior==
From 1968 to 1977, the Masters and Johnson Institute ran a program to convert homosexuals to heterosexuality. This program reported a 71.6% success rate over a six-year treatment period. At the time of their earlier work, homosexuality was classified as a psychological disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, and such attempts to treat homosexuality were not unusual. This classification was repealed in 1973.

Thomas Maier stated &quot;that Virginia Johnson had serious reservations about Masters&#x27; conversion theory, and she suspected that, at worst, the results of the study may have been fabricated by William Masters&quot;. Psychiatrist Robert C. Kolodny, a clinical associate of the Masters&#x27;, also expressed reservations about the veracity of the findings in Masters&#x27; book on the topic and alleged that Masters had not kept files of the case studies cited in the book. Shortly before the book was published, he wrote Masters a two-page letter expressing Johnson&#x27;s and Kolodny&#x27;s reservations on the alleged successful reconversion findings and urging him to reconsider publication of the book, to no avail. As homosexuality was on the verge of being dropped from the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM), Masters&#x27;s insistence on publishing the book proved to be tone-deaf and was shunned by book critics.

==Criticisms==
Some sex researchers, Shere Hite in particular, have focused on understanding how individuals regard sexual experience and the meaning it holds for them. Hite has criticized Masters and Johnson&#x27;s work for uncritically incorporating cultural attitudes on sexual behavior into their research; for example, her work concluded that the 70% of women who do not have orgasms through intercourse are able to achieve orgasm easily by masturbation. She, as well as Elisabeth Lloyd, have criticized Masters and Johnson&#x27;s argument that enough clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm should be provided by thrusting during intercourse, and the inference that the failure of this is a sign of female &quot;sexual dysfunction&quot;. While not denying that both Kinsey and Masters and Johnson have made major contributions to sex research, she believes that people must understand the cultural and personal construction of sexual experience to make the research relevant to sexual behavior outside the laboratory. Hite&#x27;s work, however, has been challenged for methodological defects.

Moreover, Masters and Johnson&#x27;s research methodology has been criticized. First, Paul Robinson argues that because many of their participants were sex workers, it is highly likely that these individuals have had more sexual experience and are more comfortable with sex and sexuality in general. He says that one must approach these results with caution, because the participants do not represent the general population.

Other researchers have argued that Masters and Johnson eliminated same-sex attracted participants when studying the human sexual response cycle, which also limits the generalizability of their results.

Furthermore, Masters and Johnson have been criticized for studying sexual behaviors in the laboratory. While they attempted to make participants as comfortable as possible in the lab by giving them a &quot;practice session&quot; before their behavior was recorded, critics have argued that two people engaging in sexual activity in a lab is a different experience compared to being in the privacy and comfort of one&#x27;s home.

Another persistent critique was that despite her extensive years of clinical work, Virginia Johnson never earned a university degree and often did not correct those who referred to her in the press or in person as &quot;Dr. Johnson.&quot;

== Television ==
Masters and Johnson appeared together on the NBC daily news program &quot;America Alive!&quot; in the second half of 1978, as authorities on the subject of sex.

==In popular culture==
The American cable network Showtime debuted &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;, a dramatic television series based on the 2009 biography of the same name, on September 29, 2013. The series stars Michael Sheen as Masters and Lizzy Caplan as Johnson. (The same actors briefly portrayed &quot;Masters and Johnson&quot;, as similar characters but in the present day, in The Simpsons episode &quot;Kamp Krustier&quot;.)

<doc id="255446" wikidata="Q2420179" url="?curid=255446" title="Thermodynamic potential">
<text>A thermodynamic potential (or more accurately, a thermodynamic potential energy) is a scalar quantity used to represent the thermodynamic state of a system. Just as in mechanics, where potential energy is defined as capacity to do work, similarly different potentials have different meanings. The concept of thermodynamic potentials was introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1886. Josiah Willard Gibbs in his papers used the term &quot;fundamental functions&quot;. Effects of changes in thermodynamic potentials can sometimes be measured directly, while their absolute magnitudes can only be assessed using computational chemistry or similar methods. 

One main thermodynamic potential that has a physical interpretation is the internal energy . It is the energy of configuration of a given system of conservative forces (that is why it is called potential) and only has meaning with respect to a defined set of references (or data). Expressions for all other thermodynamic energy potentials are derivable via Legendre transforms from an expression for . In other words, each thermodynamic potential is equivalent to other thermodynamic potentials; each potential is a different expression of the others.

In thermodynamics, external forces, such as gravity, are counted as contributing to total energy rather than to thermodynamic potentials. For example, the working fluid in a steam engine sitting on top of Mount Everest has higher total energy due to gravity than it has at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, but the same thermodynamic potentials. This is because the gravitational potential energy belongs to the total energy rather than to thermodynamic potentials such as internal energy.

== Description and interpretation ==
Five common thermodynamic potentials are:
where = temperature, = entropy, = pressure, = volume. is the number of particles of type in the system and is the chemical potential for an -type particle. The set of all are also included as natural variables but may be ignored when no chemical reactions are occurring which cause them to change. The Helmholtz free energy is in ISO/IEC standard called Helmholtz energy or Helmholtz function. It is often denoted by the symbol , but the use of is preferred by IUPAC, ISO and IEC.

These five common potentials are all potential energies, but there are also entropy potentials. The thermodynamic square can be used as a tool to recall and derive some of the potentials.

Just as in mechanics, where potential energy is defined as capacity to do work, similarly different potentials have different meanings like the below:
* Internal energy () is the capacity to do work plus the capacity to release heat.
* Gibbs energy () is the capacity to do non-mechanical work.
* Enthalpy () is the capacity to do non-mechanical work plus the capacity to release heat.
* Helmholtz energy () is the capacity to do mechanical work plus non-mechanical work.
From these meanings (which actually apply in specific conditions, e.g. constant pressure, temperature, etc.), for positive changes (e.g., ), we can say that is the energy added to the system, is the total work done on it, is the non-mechanical work done on it, and is the sum of non-mechanical work done on the system and the heat given to it.

Note that the sum of internal energy is conserved, but the sum of Gibbs energy, or Helmholtz energy, are not conserved, despite being named &quot;energy&quot;. They can be better interpreted as the potential to perform &quot;useful work&quot;, and the potential can be wasted.

Thermodynamic potentials are very useful when calculating the equilibrium results of a chemical reaction, or when measuring the properties of materials in a chemical reaction. The chemical reactions usually take place under some constraints such as constant pressure and temperature, or constant entropy and volume, and when this is true, there is a corresponding thermodynamic potential that comes into play. Just as in mechanics, the system will tend towards a lower value of a potential and at equilibrium, under these constraints, the potential will take the unchanging minimum value. The thermodynamic potentials can also be used to estimate the total amount of energy available from a thermodynamic system under the appropriate constraint.

In particular: (see principle of minimum energy for a derivation)

* When the entropy and &quot;external parameters&quot; (e.g. volume) of a closed system are held constant, the internal energy decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium. This follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics and is called the &quot;principle of minimum energy&quot;. The following three statements are directly derivable from this principle.
* When the temperature and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the Helmholtz free energy decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.
* When the pressure and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the enthalpy decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.
* When the temperature , pressure and external parameters of a closed system are held constant, the Gibbs free energy decreases and reaches a minimum value at equilibrium.

== Natural variables ==
For each thermodynamic potential, there are thermodynamic variables that need to be held constant to specify the potential value at a thermodynamical equilibrium state, such as independent variables for a mathematical function. These variables are termed the natural variables of that potential. The natural variables are important not only to specify the potential value at the equilibrium, but also because if a thermodynamic potential can be determined as a function of its natural variables, all of the thermodynamic properties of the system can be found by taking partial derivatives of that potential with respect to its natural variables and this is true for no other combination of variables. If a thermodynamic potential is not given as a function of its natural variables, it will not, in general, yield all of the thermodynamic properties of the system.

The set of natural variables for each of the above four thermodynamic potentials is formed from a combination of the , , , variables, excluding any pairs of conjugate variables; there is no natural variable set for a potential including the - or - variables together as conjugate variables for energy. An exception for this rule is the − conjugate pairs as there is no reason to ignore these in the thermodynamic potentials, and in fact we may additionally define the four potentials for each species. Using IUPAC notation in which the brackets contain the natural variables (other than the main four), we have:

If there is only one species, then we are done. But, if there are, say, two species, then there will be additional potentials such as formula_1 and so on. If there are dimensions to the thermodynamic space, then there are unique thermodynamic potentials. For the most simple case, a single phase ideal gas, there will be three dimensions, yielding eight thermodynamic potentials.

== Fundamental equations ==

The definitions of the thermodynamic potentials may be differentiated and, along with the first and second laws of thermodynamics, a set of differential equations known as the &quot;fundamental equations&quot; follow. (Actually they are all expressions of the same fundamental thermodynamic relation, but are expressed in different variables.) By the first law of thermodynamics, any differential change in the internal energy of a system can be written as the sum of heat flowing into the system subtracted by the work done by the system on the environment, along with any change due to the addition of new particles to the system:

:formula_2

where is the infinitesimal heat flow into the system, and is the infinitesimal work done by the system, is the chemical potential of particle type and is the number of the type particles. (Neither nor are exact differentials, i.e., they are thermodynamic process path-dependent. Small changes in these variables are, therefore, represented with rather than .)

By the second law of thermodynamics, we can express the internal energy change in terms of state functions and their differentials. In case of reversible changes we have:

formula_3
formula_4

where
* is temperature,
* is entropy,
* is pressure, and
* is volume,
and the equality holds for reversible processes.

This leads to the standard differential form of the internal energy in case of a quasistatic reversible change:

formula_5

Since , and are thermodynamic functions of state (also called state functions), the above relation also holds for arbitrary non-reversible changes. If the system has more external variables than just the volume that can change, the fundamental thermodynamic relation generalizes to:

formula_6

Here the are the generalized forces corresponding to the external variables .

Applying Legendre transforms repeatedly, the following differential relations hold for the four potentials (&quot;fundamental thermodynamic equations or fundamental thermodynamic relation&quot;):

The infinitesimals on the right-hand side of each of the above equations are of the natural variables of the potential on the left-hand side. Similar equations can be developed for all of the other thermodynamic potentials of the system. There will be one fundamental equation for each thermodynamic potential, resulting in a total of fundamental equations.

The differences between the four thermodynamic potentials can be summarized as follows:

formula_7
formula_8

== Equations of state ==
We can use the above equations to derive some differential definitions of some thermodynamic parameters. If we define to stand for any of the thermodynamic potentials, then the above equations are of the form:

formula_9

where and are conjugate pairs, and the are the natural variables of the potential . From the chain rule it follows that:

formula_10

where is the set of all natural variables of except that are held as constants. This yields expressions for various thermodynamic parameters in terms of the derivatives of the potentials with respect to their natural variables. These equations are known as &quot;equations of state&quot; since they specify parameters of the thermodynamic state. If we restrict ourselves to the potentials (Internal energy), (Helmholtz energy), (Enthalpy) and (Gibbs energy), then we have the following equations of state (subscripts showing natural variables that are held as constants):

formula_11

formula_12

formula_13

formula_14

formula_15

where, in the last equation, is any of the thermodynamic potentials (, , , or ), and formula_16 are the set of natural variables for that potential, excluding . If we use all thermodynamic potentials, then we will have more equations of state such as

formula_17

and so on. In all, if the thermodynamic space is dimensions, then there will be  equations for each potential, resulting in a total of equations of state because thermodynamic potentials exist. If the equations of state for a particular potential are known, then the fundamental equation for that potential (i.e., the exact differential of the thermodynamic potential) can be determined. This means that all thermodynamic information about the system will be known because the fundamental equations for any other potential can be found via the Legendre transforms and the corresponding equations of state for each potential as partial derivatives of the potential can also be found.

== Measurement of thermodynamic potentials ==

The above equations of state suggest methods to experimentally measure changes in the thermodynamic potentials using physically measurable parameters. For example the free energy expressions

formula_18

and

formula_19

can be integrated at constant temperature and quantities to obtain:

:formula_20(at constant &quot;T&quot;, {Nj} )

:formula_21(at constant &quot;T&quot;, {Nj} )

which can be measured by monitoring the measurable variables of pressure, temperature and volume. Changes in the enthalpy and internal energy can be measured by calorimetry (which measures the amount of heat &quot;ΔQ&quot; released or absorbed by a system). The expressions

formula_11

can be integrated:

:formula_23(at constant &quot;P&quot;, {Nj} )

:formula_24(at constant &quot;V&quot;, {Nj} )

Note that these measurements are made at constant {&quot;Nj&quot; } and are therefore not applicable to situations in which chemical reactions take place.

== Maxwell relations ==
Again, define and to be conjugate pairs, and the to be the natural variables of some potential . We may take the &quot;cross differentials&quot; of the state equations, which obey the following relationship:

formula_25

From these we get the Maxwell relations. There will be of them for each potential giving a total of equations in all. If we restrict ourselves the , , , 

formula_26
formula_27
formula_28
formula_29

Using the equations of state involving the chemical potential we get equations such as:

formula_30

and using the other potentials we can get equations such as:

formula_31
formula_32

== Euler relations ==
Again, define and to be conjugate pairs, and the to be the natural variables of the internal energy.
Since all of the natural variables of the internal energy are extensive quantities

formula_33

it follows from Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem that the internal energy can be written as:

formula_34

From the equations of state, we then have:

formula_35

This formula is known as an &quot;Euler relation&quot;, because Euler&#x27;s theorem on homogeneous functions leads to it. (It was not discovered by Euler in an investigation of thermodynamics, which did not exist in his day.).

Substituting into the expressions for the other main potentials we have:

formula_36
formula_37
formula_38

As in the above sections, this process can be carried out on all of the other thermodynamic potentials. Thus, there is another Euler relation, based on the expression of entropy as a function of internal energy and other extensive variables. Yet other Euler relations hold for other fundamental equations for energy or entropy, as respective functions of other state variables including some intensive state variables.

== Gibbs–Duhem relation ==
Deriving the Gibbs–Duhem equation from basic thermodynamic state equations is straightforward. Equating any thermodynamic potential definition with its Euler relation expression yields:

formula_39

Differentiating, and using the second law:

formula_40

yields:

formula_41

Which is the Gibbs–Duhem relation. The Gibbs–Duhem is a relationship among the intensive parameters of the system. It follows that for a simple system with components, there will be independent parameters, or degrees of freedom. For example, a simple system with a single component will have two degrees of freedom, and may be specified by only two parameters, such as pressure and volume for example. The law is named after Josiah Willard Gibbs and Pierre Duhem.

== Stability conditions ==
As the internal energy is a convex function of entropy and volume, the stability condition requires that the second derivative of internal energy with entropy or volume to be positive. It is commonly expressed as formula_42. Since the maximum principle of entropy is equivalent to minimum principle of internal energy, the combined criteria for stability or thermodynamic equilibrium is expressed as formula_42 and formula_44 for parameters, entropy and volume. This is analogous to formula_45 and formula_46 condition for entropy at equilibrium. The same concept can be applied to the various thermodynamic potentials by identifying if they are convex or concave of respective their variables.

formula_47 and formula_48

Where Helmholtz energy is a concave function of temperature and convex function of volume.

formula_49 and formula_50

Where enthalpy is a concave function of pressure and convex function of entropy.

formula_51 and formula_52

Where Gibbs potential is a concave function of both pressure and temperature.

In general the thermodynamic potentials (the internal energy and its Legendre transforms), are convex functions of their extrinsic variables and concave functions of intrinsic variables. The stability conditions impose that isothermal compressibility is positive and that for non-negative temperature, formula_53.

== Chemical reactions ==
Changes in these quantities are useful for assessing the degree to which a chemical reaction will proceed. The relevant quantity depends on the reaction conditions, as shown in the following table. denotes the change in the potential and at equilibrium the change will be zero.

Most commonly one considers reactions at constant and , so the Gibbs free energy is the most useful potential in studies of chemical reactions.

<doc id="255447" wikidata="Q865821" url="?curid=255447" title="Helmholtz free energy">
<text>In thermodynamics, the Helmholtz free energy (or Helmholtz energy) is a thermodynamic potential that measures the useful work obtainable from a closed thermodynamic system at a constant temperature (isothermal). The change in the Helmholtz energy during a process is equal to the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process in which temperature is held constant. At constant temperature, the Helmholtz free energy is minimized at equilibrium.

In contrast, the Gibbs free energy or free enthalpy is most commonly used as a measure of thermodynamic potential (especially in chemistry) when it is convenient for applications that occur at constant &quot;pressure&quot;. For example, in explosives research Helmholtz free energy is often used, since explosive reactions by their nature induce pressure changes. It is also frequently used to define fundamental equations of state of pure substances.

The concept of free energy was developed by Hermann von Helmholtz, a German physicist, and first presented in 1882 in a lecture called &quot;On the thermodynamics of chemical processes&quot;. From the German word &quot;Arbeit&quot; (work), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommends the symbol &quot;A&quot; and the name &quot;Helmholtz energy&quot;. In physics, the symbol &quot;F&quot; is also used in reference to &quot;free energy&quot; or &quot;Helmholtz function&quot;.

==Definition==
The Helmholtz free energy is defined as
formula_1
where
* &quot;F&quot; is the Helmholtz free energy (sometimes also called &quot;A&quot;, particularly in the field of chemistry) (SI: joules, CGS: ergs),
* &quot;U&quot; is the internal energy of the system (SI: joules, CGS: ergs),
* &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature (kelvins) of the surroundings, modelled as a heat bath,
* &quot;S&quot; is the entropy of the system (SI: joules per kelvin, CGS: ergs per kelvin).

The Helmholtz energy is the Legendre transformation of the internal energy &quot;U&quot;, in which temperature replaces entropy as the independent variable.

==Formal development==
The first law of thermodynamics in a closed system provides
formula_2
where formula_3 is the internal energy, formula_4 is the energy added as heat, and formula_5 is the work done on the system. The second law of thermodynamics for a reversible process yields formula_6. In case of a reversible change, the work done can be expressed as formula_7 (ignoring electrical and other non-&quot;PV&quot; work) and so:
formula_8

Applying the product rule for differentiation to formula_9, it follows
formula_10
and
formula_11

The definition of formula_12 allows us to rewrite this as 
formula_13

Because &quot;F&quot; is a thermodynamic function of state, this relation is also valid for a process (without electrical work or composition change) that is not reversible.

==Minimum free energy and maximum work principles==
The laws of thermodynamics are only directly applicable to systems in thermal equilibrium. If we wish to describe phenomena like chemical reactions, then the best we can do is to consider suitably chosen initial and final states in which the system is in (metastable) thermal equilibrium. If the system is kept at fixed volume and is in contact with a heat bath at some constant temperature, then we can reason as follows.

Since the thermodynamical variables of the system are well defined in the initial state and the final state, the internal energy increase formula_14, the entropy increase formula_15, and the total amount of work that can be extracted, performed by the system, formula_16, are well defined quantities. Conservation of energy implies

formula_17

The volume of the system is kept constant. This means that the volume of the heat bath does not change either, and we can conclude that the heat bath does not perform any work. This implies that the amount of heat that flows into the heat bath is given by

formula_18

The heat bath remains in thermal equilibrium at temperature &quot;T&quot; no matter what the system does. Therefore, the entropy change of the heat bath is

formula_19

The total entropy change is thus given by

formula_20

Since the system is in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath in the initial and the final states, &quot;T&quot; is also the temperature of the system in these states. The fact that the system&#x27;s temperature does not change allows us to express the numerator as the free energy change of the system:

formula_21

Since the total change in entropy must always be larger or equal to zero, we obtain the inequality

formula_22

We see that the total amount of work that can be extracted in an isothermal process is limited by the free-energy decrease, and that increasing the free energy in a reversible process requires work to be done on the system. If no work is extracted from the system, then

formula_23

and thus for a system kept at constant temperature and volume and not capable of performing electrical or other non-&quot;PV&quot; work, the total free energy during a spontaneous change can only decrease.

This result seems to contradict the equation d&quot;F&quot; = −&quot;S&quot; d&quot;T&quot; − &quot;P&quot; d&quot;V&quot;, as keeping &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot; constant seems to imply d&quot;F&quot; = 0, and hence &quot;F&quot; = constant. In reality there is no contradiction: In a simple one-component system, to which the validity of the equation d&quot;F&quot; = −&quot;S&quot; d&quot;T&quot; − &quot;P&quot; d&quot;V&quot; is restricted, no process can occur at constant &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, since there is a unique &quot;P&quot;(&quot;T&quot;, &quot;V&quot;) relation, and thus &quot;T&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;P&quot; are all fixed. To allow for spontaneous processes at constant &quot;T&quot; and &quot;V&quot;, one needs to enlarge the thermodynamical state space of the system. In case of a chemical reaction, one must allow for changes in the numbers &quot;N&quot;&quot;j&quot; of particles of each type &quot;j&quot;. The differential of the free energy then generalizes to

formula_24

where the formula_25 are the numbers of particles of type j and the formula_26 are the corresponding chemical potentials. This equation is then again valid for both reversible and non-reversible changes. In case of a spontaneous change at constant T and V, the last term will thus be negative.

In case there are other external parameters, the above relation further generalizes to

formula_27

Here the formula_28 are the external variables, and the formula_29 the corresponding generalized forces.

==Relation to the canonical partition function==
A system kept at constant volume, temperature, and particle number is described by the canonical ensemble. The probability of finding the system in some energy eigenstate &quot;r&quot;, for any microstate &quot;i&quot;, is given by
formula_30
where
*formula_31
*formula_32 is the energy of accessible state formula_33
*formula_34

&quot;Z&quot; is called the partition function of the system. The fact that the system does not have a unique energy means that the various thermodynamical quantities must be defined as expectation values. In the thermodynamical limit of infinite system size, the relative fluctuations in these averages will go to zero.

The average internal energy of the system is the expectation value of the energy and can be expressed in terms of &quot;Z&quot; as follows:

formula_35

If the system is in state &quot;r&quot;, then the generalized force corresponding to an external variable &quot;x&quot; is given by

formula_36

The thermal average of this can be written as

formula_37

Suppose that the system has one external variable formula_38. Then changing the system&#x27;s temperature parameter by formula_39 and the external variable by formula_40 will lead to a change in formula_41:

formula_42

If we write formula_43 as

formula_44

we get

formula_45

This means that the change in the internal energy is given by

formula_46

In the thermodynamic limit, the fundamental thermodynamic relation should hold:

formula_47

This then implies that the entropy of the system is given by

formula_48

where &quot;c&quot; is some constant. The value of &quot;c&quot; can be determined by considering the limit &quot;T&quot; → 0. In this limit the entropy becomes formula_49, where formula_50 is the ground-state degeneracy. The partition function in this limit is formula_51, where formula_52 is the ground-state energy. Thus, we see that formula_53 and that

=== Relating free energy to other variables ===

Combining the definition of Helmholtz free energy

formula_54

along with the fundamental thermodynamic relation

formula_55

one can find expressions for entropy, pressure and chemical potential:

formula_56

These three equations, along with the free energy in terms of the partition function,

formula_57

allow an efficient way of calculating thermodynamic variables of interest given the partition function and are often used in density of state calculations. One can also do Legendre transformations for different systems. For example, for a system with a magnetic field or potential, it is true that

formula_58

==Bogoliubov inequality==
Computing the free energy is an intractable problem for all but the simplest models in statistical physics. A powerful approximation method is mean-field theory, which is a variational method based on the Bogoliubov inequality. This inequality can be formulated as follows.

Suppose we replace the real Hamiltonian formula_59 of the model by a trial Hamiltonian formula_60, which has different interactions and may depend on extra parameters that are not present in the original model. If we choose this trial Hamiltonian such that

formula_61

where both averages are taken with respect to the canonical distribution defined by the trial Hamiltonian formula_60, then the Bogoliubov inequality states

formula_63

where formula_64 is the free energy of the original Hamiltonian, and formula_65 is the free energy of the trial Hamiltonian. We will prove this below.

By including a large number of parameters in the trial Hamiltonian and minimizing the free energy, we can expect to get a close approximation to the exact free energy.

The Bogoliubov inequality is often applied in the following way. If we write the Hamiltonian as

formula_66

where formula_67 is some exactly solvable Hamiltonian, then we can apply the above inequality by defining

formula_68

Here we have defined formula_69 to be the average of &quot;X&quot; over the canonical ensemble defined by formula_67. Since formula_60 defined this way differs from formula_67 by a constant, we have in general

formula_73

where formula_74 is still the average over formula_60, as specified above. Therefore,

formula_76

and thus the inequality

formula_77

holds. The free energy formula_65 is the free energy of the model defined by formula_67 plus formula_80. This means that

formula_81

and thus

formula_82

===Proof of the Bogoliubov inequality===

For a classical model we can prove the Bogoliubov inequality as follows. We denote the canonical probability distributions for the Hamiltonian and the trial Hamiltonian by formula_83 and formula_84, respectively. From Gibbs&#x27; inequality we know that:

formula_85

holds. To see this, consider the difference between the left hand side and the right hand side. We can write this as:

formula_86

Since

formula_87

it follows that:

formula_88

where in the last step we have used that both probability distributions are normalized to 1.

We can write the inequality as:

formula_89

where the averages are taken with respect to formula_84. If we now substitute in here the expressions for the probability distributions:

formula_91

and

formula_92

we get:

formula_93

Since the averages of formula_59 and formula_60 are, by assumption, identical we have:

formula_96

Here we have used that the partition functions are constants with respect to taking averages and that the free energy is proportional to minus the logarithm of the partition function.

We can easily generalize this proof to the case of quantum mechanical models. We denote the eigenstates of formula_60 by formula_98. We denote the diagonal components of the density matrices for the canonical distributions for formula_59 and formula_60 in this basis as:

formula_101

and

formula_102

where the formula_103 are the eigenvalues of formula_60

We assume again that the averages of H and formula_60 in the canonical ensemble defined by formula_60 are the same:

formula_107

where
formula_108

The inequality

formula_85

still holds as both the formula_83 and the formula_84 sum to 1. On the l.h.s. we can replace:

formula_112

On the right-hand side we can use the inequality

formula_113
where we have introduced the notation

formula_114

for the expectation value of the operator Y in the state r. See here for a proof. Taking the logarithm of this inequality gives:

formula_115

This allows us to write:

formula_116

The fact that the averages of H and formula_60 are the same then leads to the same conclusion as in the classical case:

formula_118

== Generalized Helmholtz energy ==

In the more general case, the mechanical term formula_119 must be replaced by the product of volume, stress, and an infinitesimal strain:

formula_120

where formula_121 is the stress tensor, and formula_122 is the strain tensor. In the case of linear elastic materials that obey Hooke&#x27;s law, the stress is related to the strain by

formula_123

where we are now using Einstein notation for the tensors, in which repeated indices in a product are summed. We may integrate the expression for formula_124 to obtain the Helmholtz energy:

formula_125

== Application to fundamental equations of state ==

The Helmholtz free energy function for a pure substance (together with its partial derivatives) can be used to determine all other thermodynamic properties for the substance. See, for example, the equations of state for water, as given by the IAPWS in their IAPWS-95 release.

== Application to training auto-encoders ==

Hinton and Zemel &quot;derive an objective function for training auto-encoder based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle&quot;. &quot;The description length of an input vector using a particular code is the sum of the code cost and reconstruction cost. They define this to be the energy of the code. Given an input vector, they define the energy of a code to be the sum of the code cost and the reconstruction cost.&quot; The true expected combined cost is
formula_126
&quot;which has exactly the form of Helmholtz free energy&quot;.

<text>The University of Groningen (abbreviated as UG; , abbreviated as RUG) is a public research university of more than 30,000 students in the city of Groningen in the Netherlands. Founded in 1614, the university is the second-oldest in the country (after Leiden).

The University of Groningen has eleven faculties, nine graduate schools, 27 research centres and institutes, and more than 175-degree programmes. The university&#x27;s alumni and faculty include Johann Bernoulli, Aletta Jacobs, four Nobel Prize winners, nine Spinoza Prize winners, one Stevin Prize winner, various members of the Dutch royal family, several politicians, the first president of the European Central Bank, and a secretary general of NATO.

==History==
The institution was founded as a college in 1614 in an initiative taken by the Regional Assembly of the city of Groningen and the &quot;Ommelanden&quot;, or surrounding region. There were four faculties – Theology, Law, Medicine, and Philosophy.

The coat of arms of the university was confirmed by The Estates of the City and County of Groningen in 1615. It consists of the provincial arms, charged with an open book inscribed with the abbreviated words VER/BVM/DNI LV/CER/NA, short for &quot;Verbum Domini Lucerna Pedibus Nostris&quot;. The shield is surmounted by a golden crown of five leaves and four pearls.

In the first 75 years of its existence about 100 students enrolled every year. Almost half of the students and lecturers came from outside the Netherlands – the first &quot;rector magnificus&quot;, Ubbo Emmius, came from East Frisia in modern-day Germany, for instance – but at the same time there was already a close relationship between the university and the city and the surrounding region.

The development of the university came to a standstill at the end of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century because of theological differences of opinion, a difficult relationship with the Regional Assembly and political problems that included the month-long siege of the city by the prince-bishop of Münster ‘&quot;Bommen Berend (Bombing Bernhard)&quot;’ in 1672 during which the university fielded a voluntary student company (VSC). On average two to three hundred students were registered with the university at any one time during this period.


During the French occupation between 1775 and 1814 the University of Groningen was administered by the Imperial University of Paris. Unlike Leiden University, it was not shut down and the institute was renamed Imperial University of Groningen (&quot;Keizerlijke Universiteit Groningen&quot;). During this time period, it remained the only open university in the Kingdom of Holland. In 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars, at the same time as Leiden and Utrecht, the university gained recognition as a national college of higher education, but this was followed by discussions about closure. The situation improved when a new main university building, the Academiegebouw, was constructed in 1850, a building that was largely financed by the people of Groningen. A fire completely destroyed the building in 1906.

In the meantime, the Higher Education Act of 1876 had radically improved the position of the university, which was renamed the &quot;Rijksuniversiteit Groningen&quot; (RUG). Teaching took place in Dutch and Latin and the university was given a research as well as an educational duty.

The University of Groningen developed during the first decades of the twentieth century. The number of faculties and courses grew steadily while the number of students grew rapidly. When the university celebrated its first 300 years in 1914 there were 611 registered students; this had grown to 1,000 by 1924. After a drop back during the Depression, and in particular during the Second World War, the number of students grew rapidly from 1945 to reach 20,000 in 1994. In recent times there are about 32,700 students registered at the University of Groningen with the number of foreign students again growing steadily, and following the tradition set by the first Rector Magnificus, the number of German students and researchers has grown strongly.

In March 2015, the RUG signed an agreement with the China Agricultural University to establish a campus in the Chinese city of Yantai. This would have made the RUG the first Dutch university to open a campus in China. The plan was heavily criticised, mainly due to worries about the restriction of academic freedom caused by censorship in China. In January 2018, the plans were cancelled by the Executive Board of the UG, based on the &quot;insufficient support for the project&quot;.

=== Faculties ===




The University of Groningen is organized in eleven faculties that offer programmes and courses in the fields of humanities, social sciences, law, economics and business, spatial sciences, life sciences, and natural sciences and technology. Each faculty (&quot;cf.&quot;, College in the USA or School in Europe) is a formal grouping of academic degree programmes, schools and institutes, discipline areas, research centres, and/or any combination of these drawn together for educational purposes. Each faculty offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, PhD, and exchange programmes, while some also offer short certificate courses.

Since 2014, the RUG also has a partly independent liberal arts college, University College Groningen (UCG).

=== National Cooperation ===
*Exposome-NL, Dutch consortium cooperating in the field of exposome research.

=== International Cooperation ===
The University of Groningen engages in many types of international cooperation throughout both teaching and research. The main networks and partners of the university are:

*Enlight, an alliance of nine European universities, The Guild of European research-intensive universities and the Coimbra group, a network of 37 long established European multidisciplinary universities.
*Strategic partnerships (academic connection): Universität Hamburg (UHH) and Carl von Ossietzky Universität Oldenburg 
*Global strategic partnerships: Nanyang Technological University (Singapore), Osaka University (Japan), Macquarie University (Australia), Universitas Gadjah Mada (Indonesia), Universidad de Antioquia (Colombia), Universidad de Chile (Chile), Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (Mexico), Universidade de São Paulo (Brazil), Stellenbosch University (South Africa)

== Campus ==
The various faculties are housed around the city. Most of the faculties- including the faculties of Law, Arts and Philosophy are located in and around the city center. The university&#x27;s original building, which acts as the main administrative building, lies exactly in the center of the city at the &quot;Broerstraat&quot;. The faculty of medical sciences is located close by at the University Medical Center Groningen(UMCG). The Faculties of Economics and Business, Spatial Sciences, and Science and Engineering are housed in the northern outskirts of the city, at the Zernike Campus, named after Nobel Prize winner Frits Zernike. The Zernike campus is also shared by the Hanze University of Applied Sciences, the other big university in the city, making the total number of students studying there around 40,000.

The university has libraries in three locations: the main one at the city center, one in the Duisenberg building in Zernike Campus, and one in the faculty of medicine, that includes a vast array of books and online material for students. The university has also recently opened another campus in Leeuwarden, Friesland, referred to as &quot;Campus Fryslân&quot;, that offers multiple disciplines in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

== Student life ==
The city of Groningen is known as the student city of the Netherlands; around one-third of the city&#x27;s residents are students at either The University of Groningen or at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences. The university, through ACLO, offers a wide range of sporting activities, and courses. Almost each sport has its own association, and offers the use of its facilities at discount rates for students.

The university also has multiple student societies that organize social events for its members, as well as student and study associations, that are mostly concerned with specific faculties and courses.

The use of bicycles as the means for transport is particularly prevalent for locals and students alike, and has integrated, labelled bike paths from the city center to Zernike. The city is popularly referred to as &quot;The World Cycling City&quot; because of this.

=== Student housing ===
The University of Groningen does not have student accommodation. It does, however, offer students with accommodation via SSH Student Housing, which operates student houses in various locations in Groningen, and various other cities within the Netherlands. A significant number of students live in private accommodations within the city, however, a recent addition to the housing options for students is The Student Hotel as well. In an effort to combat the annual housing shortage, the city of Groningen has incentivized the construction of short-term accommodation such as The Village which is made of shipping containers for international students. The Dutch government has strict laws for private accommodations for both tenants (students) and the landlords, so that fair rent prices, and renting conditions can be maintained.

In 2018, the university received national attention due to the housing crisis in the city of Groningen. Due to the fact that most incoming students at the university are primarily from other parts of the country, or the world, there has been a lack of housing options for students. Especially in the fall semester of 2021 the housing crisis hit its peak with hundreds of students reportedly not having any accommodation and resorting to emergency shelters. The housing shorting evoked a protest in the city centre which culminated in the Academy building being temporarily occupied by students to put pressure on the city to extend emergency housing. 

==Research==
In 2023, 635 PhDs were awarded (12% of the total for the Netherlands). Around 60% of newly-admitted PhD students came from abroad.

<text>A B[e] star, frequently called a B[e]-type star, is a B-type star with distinctive forbidden neutral or low ionisation emission lines in its spectrum. The designation results from combining the spectral class &quot;B&quot;, the lowercase &quot;e&quot; denoting emission in the spectral classification system, and the surrounding square brackets signifying forbidden lines. These stars frequently also show strong hydrogen emission lines, but this feature is present in a variety of other stars and is not sufficient to classify a B[e] object. Other observational characteristics include optical linear polarization and often infrared radiation that is much stronger than in ordinary B-class stars, called infrared excess. As the B[e] nature is transient, B[e]-type stars might exhibit a normal B-type spectrum at times, and hitherto normal B-type stars may become B[e]-type stars.

==Discovery==
Many Be stars were discovered to have spectral peculiarities. One of these peculiarities was the presence of forbidden spectral lines of ionised iron and occasionally other elements.

In 1973 a study of one of these stars, HD 45677 or FS CMa, showed an infrared excess as well as forbidden lines of [OI], [SII], [FeII], [NiII], and many more.

In 1976 a study of Be stars with infrared excesses identified a subset of stars which showed forbidden emission lines from ionised iron and some other elements. These stars were all considered to be distinct from the classical main sequence Be stars, although they appeared to consist of a wide range of different types of star. The term B[e] star was coined to group these stars.

One type of B[e] star was readily identified as being highly luminous supergiants. By 1985, eight dust-shrouded B[e] supergiants were known in the Magellanic Clouds. Others were found to be definitely not supergiants. Some were binaries, others proto-planetary nebulae, and the term &quot;B[e] phenomenon&quot; was used to make it clear that different types of star could produce the same type of spectrum.

==Classification==

Following the recognition that the B[e] phenomenon could occur in several distinct types of star, four sub-types were named:
* B[e] supergiants (sgB[e])
* pre-main sequence B[e] stars (HAeB[e]), a subset of the Herbig Ae/Be stars
* compact planetary nebulae B[e] stars (cPNB[e])
* symbiotic B[e] stars (SymB[e])

Around half of the known B[e] stars could not be placed in any of these groups and were called unclassified B[e] stars (unclB[e]). The unclB[e] stars have since been re-classified as FS CMa stars, a type of variable named for one of the earliest known B[e] stars.

==Nature ==
The forbidden emission, infrared excess, and other features indicative of the B[e] phenomenon, themselves provide strong hints at the nature of the stars. The stars are surrounded by ionised gas which produces intense emission lines in the same way as Be stars. The gas must be sufficiently extended to allow the formation of forbidden lines in the outer low density region, and also for dust to form which produces the infrared excess. These features are common to all the types of B[e] star.

The sgB[e] stars have hot fast winds which produce extended circumstellar material, plus a denser equatorial disc. HAeB[e] are surrounded by the remains of the molecular clouds which are forming the stars. Binary B[e] stars can produce discs of material as it is transferred from one star to another through roche lobe overflow. cPNB[e] are post-AGB stars that have shed their entire atmospheres after reaching the end of their lives as actively fusing stars. The FS CMa stars appear to be binaries with a rapidly rotating mass-losing component.

<text>Kaikeyi,(Sanskrit: कैकेयी, IAST: Kaikeyī) is a princess of Kekeya and the queen of Kosala in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Kaikeyi is the third queen and favourite consort of King Dasharatha, who ruled Kosala from its capital, Ayodhya. She is the mother of Bharata.

Out of Dasharatha&#x27;s three wives, Kaikeyi exerts the most influence. Formerly the princess of Kekeya, she is described to have served as an able counsellor to her husband during times of war. Initially loving and motherly towards her stepson, Prince Rama, Kaikeyi&#x27;s mind is poisoned by Manthara, her maid. Under her influence, Rama is exiled to the forest for a period of fourteen years.

== Legend ==

=== Birth and early life ===
Kaikeyi is born to King Ashvapati of Kekeya shortly before her mother was exiled. She was raised with her only mother figure being her hunchbacked nursemaid, Manthara. She is raised with seven brothers, including her twin, Yudhājit.

=== Marriage and child ===
Kaikeyi is married to the king of Kosala, Dashratha. She performs the Putrakameshti yagna alongside Dasharatha and his two other wives in hopes of blessings for children. At the sacrifice conducted by Rishyasringa to obtain sons for the childless Dasharatha, a divine being emerged from the flames with a golden vessel filled with divine &quot;payasam&quot; (a milk delicacy) prepared by the gods. Dasharatha offers half of this divine food to Kausalya, a quarter to Sumitra (i.e., literally &#x27;half of that which remained&#x27;), an eighth to Kaikeyi (i.e., again, &#x27;half of that which remained&#x27;), and then, upon reflection, gives the final eighth to Sumitra again. Consequently, Kausalya gives birth to Rama, Sumitra to the twins Lakshmana and Satrughna, and Kaikeyi to Bharata.

=== Boons by Dasharatha ===
In a battle between the devas and the asuras, Dasharatha rode to Devaloka, accompanied by Kaikeyi, to help Indra fight against the asuras. The devas were at a disadvantage due to the sorcery employed by Shambara and his army of asuras. Dasharatha, riding a chariot, faced the asuras in ten directions at the same time. In this battle, his chariot had to be turned to every direction in a swift manner. During the battle, the bolt of one of the wheels slipped out, and the wheel was about to disengage when Kaikeyi inserted her thumb in the hole of the bolt, and kept the chariot steady. When the king learnt of this, he was pleased, and offered her two boons. The queen said that she would ask for those two boons in the future, as she wished for nothing right then and there.

=== Manthara&#x27;s influence and Rama&#x27;s exile ===
Under the custom of primogeniture, Dasharatha, with the approval of the royal assembly, selected Rama to be his heir. Kaikeyi was delighted and as happy as she would have been had it been her own son during the coronation. However, Manthara, Kaikeyi&#x27;s nurse, feared that Kaikeyi would lose her status as chief queen at court if Rama ascended the throne, as Kausalya would thus become queen mother. She decided to instigate trouble. She tried to fuel Kaikeyi&#x27;s jealousy and envy of Kausalya by reminding her that her son&#x27;s coronation would give Kausalya her former status as the most important of Dasharatha&#x27;s queens and would cut Bharata out of the line of succession forever, but this had no effect on Kaikeyi at the time.

Manthara later convinced Kaikeyi to demand two boons granted to her years earlier by Dasharatha. King Dasharatha was obliged to fulfill them. Kaikeyi demanded that Bharata be crowned king, and Rama be sent to the forest for a period of fourteen years. Hearing this, Dasharatha fell into a swoon and passed the night in a pitiable condition in Kaikeyi&#x27;s palace.

=== Widowhood and later life ===
Grief-stricken, Dasharatha died of a broken heart six days after he exiled Rama from Ayodhya. Kaikeyi came to blame herself for this death. Furthermore, Bharata swore never to ascend the throne as it was his older brother&#x27;s birthright. He further blamed her for his father&#x27;s death and swore never to address her as &quot;mother&quot; again. Realising her mistake, Kaikeyi repented sending her beloved step son away for fourteen years.

After Rama&#x27;s return, she apologised to him for her sins. Rama touched her feet and said there was no need to ask for forgiveness, as he did not feel bad about what happened. He insisted that Bharata forgive his mother. Further defending Kaikeyi, Rama also argued to Bharata that this is just what mothers did. Whether good or bad, he remarked, what mothers did was for the betterment of their children, not for themselves, so it is not proper to be angry with them.

==Assessment==
Kaikeyi&#x27;s personality and her relationships are quite revealing in Ayodhya Kanda of the Valmiki Ramayana. Kaikeyi maintained strong relations with her maternal family even after her wedding to King Dasharatha. Her brother Yudhajit visits her many times and takes a keen interest in the life of her son Bharata, often taking the latter and Shatrughna away to the Kaikeya kingdom during the summer.

Kaikeyi helped her husband Dasharatha in the Dandaka forest while he was at war. While Kaikeyi saved the king in the war, as per mythology, her left hand was strong as a diamond (a boon from a Saint) so the king accompanied her during wars.

Kaikeyi was the king&#x27;s favorite queen. Kaikeyi&#x27;s nature is described as being temperamental and unpredictable. While she was mostly gentle, it is evident that she disliked the king spending time with his other queens. King Dasharatha mentions that he did not treat his queen Kausalya with the love she deserved due to fear of Kaikeyi&#x27;s tantrums and possessiveness.

Kaikeyi seemed almost naive when it came to understanding the rights of the four princes to Ayodhya&#x27;s throne. She naively mentions to her maid Manthara that Bharata can rule Ayodhya after Rama, not understanding the law of primogeniture. It is Manthara who educates Kaikeyi of the manner of succession.

Kaikeyi&#x27;s naive nature and gentleness were transformed into obstinacy and a hunger for power all in the name of her son Bharata&#x27;s welfare. Bharata contests her views vociferously and despises her for her act of banishing the rightful heir Rama to the forest for punishing him for no fault of his own. King Dasharatha tries to reason with her, arguing in terms of the stability of the kingdom, the people&#x27;s will, and the court&#x27;s decision to crown Rama, none of which seems reasonable to her. Finally, King Dasharatha renounces her, and yet he is unable to separate himself from her. He lingers on in his grief in her chambers in fear of the humiliation from everyone outside those chambers.

<text>Rangitoto Island is a volcanic island in the Hauraki Gulf near Auckland, New Zealand. The wide island is a symmetrical shield volcano cone capped by central scoria cones, reaching a height of . Rangitoto is the youngest and largest of the approximately 50 volcanoes of the Auckland volcanic field, having erupted in two phases about 1450 CE and 1500 CE and covering an area of . It is separated from the mainland of Auckland&#x27;s North Shore by the Rangitoto Channel. Since World War II, it has been linked by a causeway to the much older, non-volcanic Motutapu Island.

 is Māori for &#x27;Bloody Sky&#x27;, with the name coming from the full phrase (&quot;The days of the bleeding of Tama-te-kapua&quot;). Tama-te-kapua was the captain of the (canoe) and was badly wounded on the island, after having lost a battle with the (tribe) at Islington Bay.

==Geology==
Rangitoto formed during two phases of eruptions that may have lasted only 5–10 years, about 600 years ago. The first part of the eruption sequence, dated by radiocarbon methods at about years ago (= 553 ± 7 yrs BP) was initially wet and produced surges of volcanic ash that mantled neighbouring Motutapu Island from alkaline olivine basalt eruptives sourced from the north cone area. The later part of the eruption dated at about years ago (= 504 ± 5 yrs BP) was dry and built most of Rangitoto, erupting all the sub-alkaline basaltic lava flows of the shield and the southern scoria cone at the apex that mostly buried the north cone. The of material that erupted from the volcano was nearly as much as the combined by all the previous eruptions in the Auckland volcanic field, which were spread over nearly 200,000 years.

===Eruptive history===
In 2013, scientists from Auckland University reported that Rangitoto had been much more active in the past than previously thought, suggesting it had been active on and off for around 1000 years before the final eruptions around 600 years ago. This was based on recognition of a number of horizons of tiny volcanic glass shards, seemingly erupted from Rangitoto, in sediment cores from Lake Pupuke. To test this hypothesis, a deep hole was drilled through the western flank of Rangitoto in February 2014. No supporting evidence for these hypothesised small eruptions up to 1000 yrs before the main eruption of Rangitoto was found. The University scientists did, however, core a thin basalt lava flow within marine sediment dated at 6000 years old, and hypothesised that this was an even earlier eruption from Rangitoto. Civil Defence officials said the discovery did not make living in Auckland any more dangerous, but did change their view of how an eruption might proceed. These headline-grabbing results were controversial and not accepted by all geologists. In 2018 many of the original group of Auckland University geologists reported on their latest research and reinterpretation of the evidence and concluded that Rangitoto only erupted once, about 600 yrs ago, possibly in two phases. The thin lava flow within 6000 yr-old sediment in the Rangitoto drillcore has exactly the same chemistry as the lowest/oldest flows of the cored shield volcano above and has recently been shown to also have the same U-Th-Ra signature and both must have been erupted and solidified at virtually the same time. The thin &quot;flow&quot; is therefore likely to be basalt lava that was intruded into the sediment as the shield volcano was starting to be formed. This is similar to the situation seen on the coast at Queen Victoria Rock, near the Rangitoto Lighthouse, where lava flows have ploughed into the soft seafloor sediment and intruded into it, bringing at least one sediment slab up to high tide level. Thus no evidence has been found so far to support the hypotheses of earlier eruptions of Rangitoto between 620 and 8000 yrs ago. It is possible that Rangitoto buried a smaller and much older and unrelated volcano, a view possibly supported, but certainly not proven, by recent microfossil research from the marine sediments obtained from beneath Rangitoto in the stratigraphic drillhole.

===Structure===

The southern cone of Rangitoto Volcano with its own crater likely buries a more northern explosion crater and tuff ring formed during the early wet phase of eruption in the middle of the Waitemata Harbour. The external form of Rangitoto consists of a circular, gently sloping shield composed of numerous overlapping lava flows. The centre of the volcano is capped by the remains of much steeper scoria cones made of loose scoria that was erupted by dry-style fire-fountaining from several vents. 
Gravitational studies show a relationship with the Islington Bay Fault which strikes between Rangitoto and Mototapu islands but which is distinctly offset by about from the Rangitoto vents to the east of the fault and that there is a density beneath the southern cones. This along with magnetic studies has been interpreted to show a solidified intra-cone feeder dyke as the most likely explanation for the mass under the southern cone system and some buried mass to the north of the northern cone whose character can not be fully modelled but is likely to be a feeder dyke. At depth of more than the magma may have initially tracked the Islington Bay Fault in this modelling.
Withdrawal of magma back down the throat of the volcano at the end of the eruptions has resulted in slight subsidence of the scoria cones. This has created a moat-like ring around the central scoria cones, which the main track to Rangitoto&#x27;s summit passes through on the way to the summit and gives a distinctive shape to the island. In some parts of the island, fields of clinker-like black basalt lava are exposed where vegetation has yet to colonise the surface of the youngest lava flows. About 200 metres from the top of the mountain on the eastern side visitors can walk through sections of two lava tubes — cave-like tubes left behind after the passage of liquid lava. The more accessible of the caves are signposted. Lava tubes are formed when low-viscosity molten lava known as pahoehoe flows and cools on the outside due to contact with the ground and air, to form a hard crust allowing the still-liquid molten lava to continue to flow through inside. In several places the lava tube roof has collapsed thus providing several different entrances to the one elongate tube. A torch is needed to explore the caves. The longest known cave is about 120 m long.

==Biology==

Because there are virtually no streams on the island, plants rely on rainfall for moisture. It has the largest forest of pōhutukawa trees in the world, as well as many northern rātā trees. In total, more than 200 species of trees and flowers thrive on the island, including several species of orchid, as well as more than 40 types of ferns. The vegetation pattern was influenced by the more recent eruptions creating lava flow crevices where pōhutukawa trees (&quot;Metrosideros&quot; ssp.) grow.
The island is considered especially significant because all stages from raw lava fields to scrub establishment and sparse forests are visible. As lava fields contain no soil of the typical kind, windblown matter and slow breaking-down processes of the native flora are still in the process of transforming the island into a more habitable area for most plants (an example of primary succession), which is one of the reasons why the local forests are relatively young and do not yet support a large bird population. However, the Kākā, a New Zealand-endemic parrot, is thought to have lived on the island in pre-European times.

Goats were present on Rangitoto in large numbers in the mid 19th century and survived until the 1880s. Fallow deer were introduced to Motutapu in 1862 and spread to Rangitoto, but disappeared by the 1980s. The brush-tailed rock-wallaby was introduced to Motutapu in 1873, and was common on Rangitoto by 1912, and the brushtail possum was introduced in 1931 and again in 1946. Both were eradicated in a campaign from 1990 to 1996 using 1080 and cyanide poison and dogs. The eradication campaign did not have a significant effect on bird species diversity and abundance, due to the presence of other predators.

Stoats, rabbits, mice, rats, cats and hedgehogs remained a problem on the island, but the Department of Conservation (DOC) aimed to eradicate them beginning with the poisoning of black rats, brown rats and mice and in August 2011, both Rangitoto and neighbouring Motutapu Islands were officially declared pest-free with both islands now also boasting populations of newly translocated North Island saddlebacks.

As the area is a DOC-administered reserve (in partnership with the &quot;tangata whenua&quot; Ngāi Tai and Ngāti Paoa), visitors may not take dogs or other animals onto the islands.

==History==

===Māori association===

The volcano erupted within the historical memory of the local Māori iwi (tribes). Human footprints have been found between layers of Rangitoto volcanic ash on the adjoining Motutapu Island. Ngāi Tai was the iwi living on Motutapu, and considers both islands their ancestral home. Ngāti Paoa also has links with Rangitoto.

The name literally means &quot;red sky&quot;, and is linked to a traditional story of a fight between Tama-te-kapua, captain of the &quot;Arawa&quot; canoe, and Hoturoa, captain of the &quot;Tainui&quot; canoe. The name (&quot;The days of the bleeding of Tama-te-kapua&quot;) refers to how Tama-te-kapua was injured in the fight. The peaks of the island were known by the names Ngā Pona Toru o Peretū (&quot;The Three Knuckles of Peretū&quot;) or Ngā Tuaitara o Taikehu (&quot;The Dorsal Fins of Taikehu&quot;). Ngā Pona Toru o Peretū, often shortened to Peretū is the traditional Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki name for the three peaks of the island, and was a name given by Taikehu, a captain of the &quot;Tainui&quot; canoe.

Rangitoto is associated with many traditional stories and myths. One involves Tiriwa (the namesake of the traditil name for the Waitākere Ranges, Te Wao Nui o Tiriwa), a chief of the supernatural Tūrehu people, who uplifted Rangitoto from Karekare on the west coast, as a show of his strength. Others involve a &#x27;tupua&#x27; couple, children of the Fire Gods. After quarreling and cursing Mahuika, the fire-goddess, they lost their home on the mainland because it was destroyed by Mataoho, god of earthquakes and eruptions, on Mahuika&#x27;s behalf. Lake Pupuke on the North Shore was created in the destruction, while Rangitoto rose from the sea. The mists surrounding Rangitoto at certain times are called the tears of the tupua for their former home.

===Since European colonisation===
The island was purchased for £15 by the Crown in 1854, very early in New Zealand&#x27;s colonisation by Europeans, and for many years served as a source of basalt for the local construction industry. It was set aside as a recreation reserve in 1890, and became a favourite spot for daytrippers. Some development occurred nonetheless. In 1892, salt works were created on near Mackenzies Bay. The wharf and summit road were opened in 1897, with another road linking the summit to Islington Bay by 1900. For over 30 years (from 1898 to 1930), scoria was quarried from near the shoreline on the west side of Islington Bay as building material for Auckland.
From 1925 to 1936, prison labour built roads on the island and a track to the summit. Islington Bay was formed in the southeast area of the island. Formerly known as Drunks Bay, it was used as a drying out area for inebriated crews before they ventured out of the gulf. The bay is used by Auckland boat-owners as a refuge, as it is quite sheltered from the prevailing southwest winds.

Military installations were built during World War II to support the Auckland harbour defences and to house U.S. troops or store mines. The most visited remains of these installations is the old observation post on the summit. The northern shore of the island was used as a wrecking ground for unwanted ships, and the remains of several wrecks are still visible at low tide. At least 13 ships were wrecked from 1887, the last being the former Wellington and, later, Waiheke ferry, Duchess, in June 1947. (built 1897 - iron deck framing remained in 2014). Other ships include &quot;Ngapuhi&quot; (1900 - her stern remained in 2014), &quot;Jubilee&quot; (1857), &quot;Arapawa&quot; (1908), &quot;Rothesay Bay&quot; (1877), &quot;Gladbrook&quot; (ex &quot;Countess of Anglesea&quot; 1877), &quot;Elinor Vernon&quot; (1876), &quot;Polly&quot; (ex &quot;Skovland&quot; 1891), &quot;Columbia&quot; (1899 - part of the keel and frame remained in 2014), &quot;Dartford&quot; (1877) and &quot;Rarawa&quot; (1903 - the bow, framing, iron plating and stern with two propeller shaft housings were visible above the low water mark in 2014).

Baches (small holiday houses) were built around the island&#x27;s edge in the 1920s and 1930s. The legality of their existence was doubtful from the start and the building of further baches was banned in 1937. Most have since been removed because of the ban and because the island has become a scenic reserve. However, 30 of the 140 baches remain , and some are being preserved to show how the island used to be, once boasting a permanent community of several hundred people, including many children. The buildings included some more permanent structures like a seawater pool built of quarried stones by convict labour, located close to the current ferry quay.
==Access and tourism==
Regular ferry services and island tours by tractor-trailer are provided by Fullers from Auckland city centre. A boardwalk with around 300 steps allows visitors to reach the summit and enjoy a view of the wooded crater. The distance to the summit is , a one–hour walk by the most direct route.

An alternative to walking, a land train, coordinated with the ferry sailings, takes visitors to a short way below the summit. Sea kayak trips from the mainland to the island are also available.

There are no campsites on the island, though there is camping at Home Bay on the adjacent Motutapu Island.

<doc id="255468" wikidata="Q185557" url="?curid=255468" title="Excretion">
<text>Excretion is elimination of metabolic waste, which is an essential process in all organisms. In vertebrates, this is primarily carried out by the lungs, kidneys, and skin. This is in contrast with secretion, where the substance may have specific tasks after leaving the cell. For example, placental mammals expel urine from the bladder through the urethra, which is part of the excretory system. Unicellular organisms discharge waste products directly through the surface of the cell.

During life activities such as cellular respiration, several chemical reactions take place in the body. These are known as metabolism. These chemical reactions produce waste products such as carbon dioxide, water, salts, urea and uric acid. Accumulation of these wastes beyond a level inside the body is harmful to the body. The excretory organs remove these wastes. This process of removal of metabolic waste from the body is known as excretion.

== Processes across various types of life ==
=== Plants ===
Green plants excrete carbon dioxide and water as respiratory products. In green plants, the carbon dioxide released during respiration gets used during photosynthesis. Oxygen is a byproduct generated during photosynthesis, and exits through stomata, root cell walls, and other routes. Plants can get rid of excess water by transpiration and guttation. It has been shown that the leaf acts as an &#x27;excretophore&#x27; and, in addition to being a primary organ of photosynthesis, is also used as a method of excreting toxic wastes via diffusion. Other waste materials that are exuded by some plants — resin, saps, latex, etc. are forced from the interior of the plant by hydrostatic pressures inside the plant and by absorptive forces of plant cells. These latter processes do not need added energy, they act passively. However, during the pre-abscission phase, the metabolic levels of a leaf are high. Plants also excrete some waste substances into the soil around them.

=== Animals ===
In animals, the main excretory products are carbon dioxide, ammonia (in ammoniotelics), urea (in ureotelics), uric acid (in uricotelics), guanine (in Arachnida), and creatine. The liver and kidneys clear many substances from the blood (for example, in renal excretion), and the cleared substances are then excreted from the body in the urine and feces.

Aquatic animals usually excrete ammonia directly into the external environment, as this compound has high solubility and there is ample water available for dilution. In terrestrial animals, ammonia-like compounds are converted into other nitrogenous materials, i.e. urea, that are less harmful as there is less water in the environment and ammonia itself is toxic. This process is called detoxification.

==== Birds ====
Birds excrete their nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in the form of a paste. Although this process is metabolically more expensive, it allows more efficient water retention and it can be stored more easily in the egg. Many avian species, especially seabirds, can also excrete salt via specialized nasal salt glands, the saline solution leaving through nostrils in the beak.

==== Insects ====
In insects, a system involving Malpighian tubules is used to excrete metabolic waste. Metabolic waste diffuses or is actively transported into the tubule, which transports the wastes to the intestines. The metabolic waste is then released from the body along with fecal matter.

The excreted material may be called &quot;ejecta&quot;. In pathology the word ejecta is more commonly used.

<doc id="255469" wikidata="Q4936576" url="?curid=255469" title="Bodies (2004 TV series)">
<text>Bodies is a British television medical drama produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC. Created by Jed Mercurio, the series first broadcast on 23 June 2004, and is based on Mercurio&#x27;s book of the same name. The series is centred on specialist registrar Rob Lake (Max Beesley), who starts in a new post in the Obstetrics and gynaecology department at the fictional South Central Infirmary, under the guidance of consultant obstetrician Roger Hurley (Patrick Baladi).

The series differed from most other archetypal British hospital dramas, in that the surgical scenes were notable for their graphic nature, offering intimate detail of various procedures, and the operational complications dealt with in explicit detail. As a result, the themes were also often dark and depressing, including negligence, manipulation and death. &quot;Bodies&quot; has been described as a &quot;dark, sometimes funny&quot; take on a genre that had been made popular through shows such as &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Holby City&quot;. In December 2009, &quot;The Times&quot; ranked &quot;Bodies&quot; in ninth place in its list of &quot;Shows of the Decade&quot;, and in January 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked &quot;Bodies&quot; number twenty of &quot;The Greatest Television Dramas of All Time&quot;.

The first series was released on DVD on 30 October 2006. The second series, including the finale, was released on 26 December 2006. A complete box set was released on 9 April 2007. The show was made available via the BBC iPlayer service on 6 April 2019.

==Broadcast==
The first series started on BBC Three, as the channel was trying to break into hour-long dramas. BBC Two aired the series at the end of 2004. The channels co-commissioned a second series and increased the number of episodes to ten. The second series started in September 2005. The BBC did not order a third series, so a feature-length final episode was subsequently broadcast to conclude the programme in December 2006. The entire first and second series were also broadcast to American audiences on digital channel BBC America during 2005.
In 2022 Netflix began streaming the series in the UK.

==Episodes==
===Series 1 (2004)===
Lake (Max Beesley) realises that despite his friendly, professional demeanour and strong academics, his boss, Hurley (Patrick Baladi), is an incompetent surgeon who regularly bungles surgical procedures, to the detriment of his patients. Hurley is, however, protected by the principle &quot;Doctors look after doctors&quot;, a phrase often repeated throughout the series. Initially, Lake is also protected by this principle, when his involvement in a death of a patient is covered up, although this death haunts him. Initially, Lake seeks to become a whistleblower, after seeing Hurley&#x27;s gross incompetence and negligence, particularly after he badly mishandles a birth in which an abruption occurs, leaving the mother with substantial brain damage. The anaesthetist for the operation, Dr. Maria Orton (Susan Lynch), makes an official complaint against Hurley, but her colleagues close ranks around him. The pregnant Dr. Orton is ostracised, and the stress of the situation causes her to miscarry. She is eventually sectioned and admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Pressure from outside authorities, hospital politics and blackmail from Hurley eventually forces Lake into silence. Unable to oust him yet forced to work with him, Lake soon seeks a way out and finds a post at another hospital. But Hurley, despite agreeing that he should move on, changes his mind, ruins Lake&#x27;s chance to escape by informing his new employers of Lake&#x27;s mistakes and his real reasons for wanting to leave. At the end of the season, Hurley is shown to be in line for promotion as the hospital&#x27;s clinical director. Lake, trapped in his job, comes clean to the relatives of the patient whose death he caused, so that, in his own words, he may be judged. The series ends on this cliffhanger.

===Series 2 (2005)===
The series continues with the main overlying storyline of the constant struggle between Hurley and Lake. This season also saw the arrival of a new departmental manager, Chrissy Farrell (Vicky Hall). At the start of the second series, Lake is about to leave the hospital but, with no real job prospects elsewhere, he decides to remain. Lake and Hurley then begin to form a respectful professional relationship, with Lake turning a blind eye to Hurley&#x27;s incompetence. Despite this, Donna Rix (Neve McIntosh), a nurse with whom Lake was having an affair, views Hurley&#x27;s ineptitude with increasing alarm. She starts to voice her distress and sends anonymous letters to management in an attempt to bring wider attention to this issue. Lake, seeing this, pleads with Donna to act with restraint, claiming that Hurley will be brought down but not in this fashion. Towards the end of the series, Hurley&#x27;s life begins to unravel. Attempts to have a third child are scuppered after he finds out he has a low sperm count and furthermore, is suspected of having an affair with a fellow doctor, soon leading to the breakdown of his marriage.

<doc id="255471" wikidata="Q5980732" url="?curid=255471" title="Ian Adams">
<text>Ian Adams (July 22, 1937 — November 7, 2021) was a Canadian author of fiction and non-fiction novels, television, and movies. Originally a journalist, he is now best known for his writing: his most successful novels are &quot;S – Portrait of a Spy&quot; and &quot;Agent of Influence&quot;.

==Childhood==
Ian Adams was born in what is now Tanzania to a Lillian and Richard Adams, Irish lay missionaries administering a medical clinic in the former Belgian Congo. According to family lore, a pregnant Lillian singlehandedly canoed across a narrow stretch of Lake Tanganyika so that Adams would be born in what was then the British colony of Tanganyika rather than in the Belgian colony his parents were working in. He grew up in Central and East Africa. During World War II, both of Adams&#x27;s parents joined the British Army, his mother as an ambulance driver and his father as an engineer, while three-year old Ian was sent to boarding school. Adams resented his parents for abandoning him at a young age and while the entire family moved to North America, Adams did so separately as a teenager and lived on his own in Winnipeg where he attended the University of Manitoba, studying fine arts.

==Career==

===Journalism===
Though an accomplished painter, Adams pursued a career initially as a photojournalist and reporter. As an award-winning investigative journalist, he worked for five years at &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, Canada&#x27;s national news magazine, covering many national stories including &quot;The Lonely Death of Charlie Wenjack&quot; (Volume 80, February 1967), reprinted under the title &quot;Why did Charlie Wenjack Die?&quot; in &quot;The Poverty Wall&quot; in 1970.

Chanie &quot;Charlie&quot; Wenjack was an Indigenous First Nations child who ran away from a residential school in northern Ontario in an attempt to reach his father, 650 kilometres away. The child was found beside a CNR track, poorly dressed and dead of hunger and cold. In the &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; article, Adams wrote: &quot;Under the heading The Lonely Death of Charlie Wenjack, he wrote, “It’s not so unusual that Indian children run away from the residential schools they are sent to. They do it all the time, and they lose their fingers and toes to frostbite. Sometimes they lose a leg or an arm trying to climb aboard freight trains. Occasionally, one of them dies. And perhaps because they are Indians, no one seems to care very much. So this, then, is the story of how a little boy met a terrible and lonely death, of the handful of people who became involved, and of a town that hardly noticed.”

The story resulted in a series of complaints to the magazine by readers, including the CEO of the magazine&#x27;s publisher, Maclean-Hunter, who wrote Adams telling him he didn&#x27;t think that sort of writing belonged in the magazine. Adams quit the publication and pursued a freelance career. In September 2012 Adams was interviewed about the Charlie Wenjack story as part of the CBC documentary &quot;Dying For An Education&quot;. Gord Downie, lead singer of the Canadian band The Tragically Hip, cited Adams&#x27; Maclean&#x27;s article as the source for his 2016 multimedia work, &quot;Secret Path&quot;.
Adams&#x27; international stories included coverage of the Vietnam War and the coup d&#x27;état that overthrew Allende in Chile, for publications such as the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;.

===Literature===
During the 1970s and 1980s Adams lived, worked and traveled extensively in South and Central America, mostly covering the so-called &quot;dirty wars&quot;. From this period came the novel &quot;Becoming Tania&quot; (published by McClelland and Stewart), the love story of Che Guevara and his compañera Tania who was killed with Che in the Bolivian jungle. Adams&#x27; screenplay adaptation, &quot;Tango Duro&quot;, was nominated in 2005 for the Writers Guild of Canada&#x27;s Best Unproduced Screenplay: the Jim Burt Prize.

His 1977 novel, &quot;S – Portrait of a Spy&quot;, led to a libel suit in which a former RCMP Security Service officer Leslie James Bennett claimed the central character, a Soviet mole who penetrated the RCMP, was modelled after him. The publisher stopped distribution of the book despite the fact that 12,000 copies had already been sold and a deal to turn the book into a movie was cancelled as a result. The case was settled out of court with Adams paying Bennett $30,000 and agreeing to add a disclaimer to the book. The novel was adapted into a play, in 1984 by Adams and Rick Salutin.

====Film adaptations====
Ian Adams and his writing partner and son, Riley Adams, have turned several of his seven published novels into movies. &quot;S – Portrait of a Spy&quot;, was scheduled for production as a feature film (by Alberta Filmworks) in the spring of 2006.

The Adams team with Riley as the lead writer has also written the original screenplays for two of the seven MOWs in this fall&#x27;s CTV lineup. &quot;&quot;, (GalaFilms) starring William Hurt, John Corbett, and Wendy Crewson; the second original screen play, &quot;The Clark Todd Story&quot;, (ImagiNation Films and Box Films, UK) was scheduled for filming to begin early in 2006.

His 1999 novel, &quot;Agent of Influence&quot;, based on the true story of Canadian diplomat John Watkins who died while under Royal Canadian Mounted Police interrogation, was adapted by the Adams team, and aired on the national CTV network in 2003–2004. Produced by Alberta FilmWorks and Gala Films, &quot;Agent of Influence&quot; starred Christopher Plummer. The film has been sold by Alliance-Atlantis to TV networks in 132 countries, and in 2003 was recognized by the European Screenplay Writers&#x27; association as the best foreign television screenplay.

The Adams partnership created the screenplay for the full-length feature, &quot;Bad Faith&quot;, adapted from Ian Adams&#x27; novel of the same title and filmed in Calgary and Montreal during March 2000 by Alberta FilmWorks — is now distributed worldwide by Oasis under the title, &quot;Cold Blooded&quot;.

Ian Adams has also written many hours of produced television for Canadian and U.S. shows.

<text>Arndt Juho Pekurinen (29 August 1905 – 5 November 1941) was a Finnish pacifist and conscientious objector.

In 1926, Pekurinen repeatedly refused mandatory conscription, leading to his imprisonment between 1929 and 1931. He refused to either wear a uniform or take arms. While Pekurinen was deeply religious, his motives were not based on his faith. His contemporaries suggested he was a communist, but he was not interested in politics. Because of his pacifist conviction, in the atmosphere of the tense 1930s, he was deemed as guilty of high treason, and the Lapua Movement harassed him relentlessly. In 1930, an international petition on his behalf was sent to the Finnish defense minister Juho Niukkanen, which included the signatures of sixty British MPs and notables such as Albert Einstein, Henri Barbusse and H. G. Wells. On 14 April 1931, the &quot;Lex Pekurinen&quot;, Finland&#x27;s first alternative to military service, was passed. However, its provisions extended only as far as peacetime.

When the Winter War broke out in 1939, Pekurinen once again found himself imprisoned. At the onset of the Continuation War in autumn 1941, he was sent to the front, with orders to make sure he did wear the uniform, and bear and use a weapon. At the front he still refused to wear a uniform or bear arms. Following an order issued by captain Pentti Valkonen, he was executed without trial. The first two soldiers (sergeant Kivelä and private Kinnunen) ordered to execute him refused; only the third, corporal Asikainen, obeyed Valkonen&#x27;s direct order.

After the war, an investigation of Pekurinen&#x27;s death was launched but never completed. He remained effectively forgotten for over fifty years, until the publication in 1998 of the book &quot;Courage: The life and execution of Arndt Pekurinen&quot; by Erno Paasilinna. The city of Helsinki named a park &quot;Arndt Pekurisen puisto&quot; (&quot;Arndt Pekurinen Park&quot;) in East Pasila in his memory.

According to the book by Paasilinna, Pekurinen&#x27;s motto was inspired by Jonathan Swift: &quot;As people are not eaten, butchering them is of no use.&quot; (&quot;Kun ihmisiä ei syödä, on niitä turha teurastaa.&quot;)

<doc id="255474" wikidata="Q991271" url="?curid=255474" title="Amazing Stories">
<text>Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but &quot;Amazing&quot; helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction.

 &quot;Amazing&quot; has been published, with some interruptions, for 98 years, going through a half-dozen owners and many editors as it struggled to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and lost control of the magazine in 1929. In 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, which hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s &quot;Amazing&quot; presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. &quot;Amazing&quot; switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly before the end of the pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen&#x27;s Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: &quot;Amazing&quot; was nominated for the prestigious Hugo Award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine. Print publication resumed with the Fall 2018 issue.

Gernsback&#x27;s initial editorial approach was to blend instruction with entertainment; he believed science fiction could educate readers. His audience rapidly showed a preference for implausible adventures, and the movement away from Gernsback&#x27;s idealism accelerated when the magazine changed hands in 1929. Despite this, Gernsback had an enormous impact on the field: the creation of a specialist magazine for science fiction spawned an entire genre publishing industry. The letter columns in &quot;Amazing&quot;, where fans could make contact with each other, led to the formation of science fiction fandom, which in turn had a strong influence on the development of the field. Writers whose first story was published in the magazine include John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov, Howard Fast, Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, and Thomas M. Disch. Overall, though, &quot;Amazing&quot; itself was rarely an influential magazine within the genre after the 1920s.

==Origins==
By the end of the 19th century, stories centered on scientific inventions, and stories set in the future, were appearing regularly in popular fiction magazines. The market for short stories lent itself to tales of invention in the tradition of Jules Verne. Magazines such as &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Argosy&quot;, launched in 1889 and 1896 respectively, carried a few science fiction stories each year. Some upmarket &quot;slick&quot; magazines such as &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, which paid well and were aimed at a more literary audience, also carried scientific stories, but by the early years of the 20th century, science fiction (though it was not yet called that) was appearing more often in the pulp magazines than in the slicks.

In 1908, Hugo Gernsback published the first issue of &quot;Modern Electrics&quot;, a magazine aimed at the scientific hobbyist. It was an immediate success, and Gernsback began to include articles on imaginative uses of science, such as &quot;Wireless on Saturn&quot; (December 1908). In April 1911, Gernsback began the serialization of his science fiction novel, &quot;Ralph 124C 41+&quot;, but in 1913 he sold his interest in the magazine to his partner and launched a new magazine, &quot;Electrical Experimenter&quot;, which soon began to publish scientific fiction. In 1920, Gernsback retitled the magazine &quot;Science and Invention&quot;, and through the early 1920s he published much scientific fiction in its pages, along with non-fiction scientific articles.

Gernsback had started another magazine called &quot;Practical Electrics&quot; in 1921. In 1924, he changed its name to &quot;The Experimenter&quot;, and sent a letter to 25,000 people to gauge interest in the possibility of a magazine devoted to scientific fiction; in his words, &quot;the response was such that the idea was given up for two years.&quot; In 1926, he decided to proceed, and ceased publication of &quot;The Experimenter&quot; to make room in his publishing schedule for a new magazine. The editor of &quot;The Experimenter&quot;, T. O&#x27;Conor Sloane, became the editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. The first issue appeared on 10 March 1926, with a cover date of April.

==Publishing history==
===1920s===
Initially the magazine focused on reprints; both classics such as Wells, Verne and Poe, and stories from other Gernsback magazines. The first original story was &quot;The Man From the Atom &quot;(Sequel)&quot;&quot; by
G. Peyton Wertenbaker in the second issue, May 1926. In the August issue, new stories (still a minority) were noted with an asterisk in the table of contents. The editorial work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C. Whitehead, were hired to help find fiction to reprint. Frank R. Paul, who had worked with Gernsback as early as 1914, became the cover artist; Paul had produced many illustrations for the fiction in &quot;The Electrical Experimenter&quot;. &quot;Amazing&quot; was issued in the large bedsheet format, 8.5 × 11.75 in (216 × 298 mm), the same size as the technical magazines. It was an immediate success and by the following March reached a circulation of 150,000. Gernsback saw there was an enthusiastic readership for &quot;scientifiction&quot; (the term &quot;science fiction&quot; had not yet been coined), and in 1927 started a Discussions section and issued &quot;Amazing Stories Annual&quot;. The annual sold out, and in January 1928, Gernsback launched a quarterly magazine, &quot;Amazing Stories Quarterly&quot;, as a regular companion to &quot;Amazing&quot;. It continued on a fairly regular schedule for 22 issues. Gernsback was slow to pay his authors and creditors; the extent of his investments limited his liquidity. On 20 February 1929 his printer and paper supplier opened bankruptcy proceedings against him. It has been suggested that Bernarr Macfadden, another magazine publisher, maneuvered to force the bankruptcy because Gernsback would not sell his titles to Macfadden, but this is unproven. Experimenter Publishing did not file any defence and was declared bankrupt by default on 6 March; &quot;Amazing&quot; survived with its existing staff, but Hugo and his brother, Sidney, were forced out as directors. Arthur H. Lynch took over as editor-in-chief, though Sloane continued to have effective control of the magazine&#x27;s contents. The receivers, Irving Trust, sold the magazine to Bergan A. Mackinnon on 3 April.

===1930s===
In August 1931, &quot;Amazing&quot; was acquired by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden&#x27;s Macfadden Publications. Macfadden&#x27;s deep pockets helped insulate &quot;Amazing&quot; from the financial strain caused by the Great Depression. The schedule of &quot;Amazing Stories Quarterly&quot; began to slip, but &quot;Amazing&quot; did not miss an issue in the early 1930s. However, it became unprofitable to publish over the next few years. Circulation dropped to little more than 25,000 in 1934, and in October 1935 it switched to bimonthly (publishing every other month).

By 1938, with &quot;Amazing&quot;&#x27;s circulation down to only 15,000, Teck Publications was having financial problems. In January, Ziff-Davis took over the magazine and shortly thereafter moved production to Chicago; the April issue was assembled by Sloane but published by Ziff-Davis. Bernard Davis, who ran Ziff-Davis&#x27;s editorial department, attempted to hire Roger Sherman Hoar as editor; Hoar turned down the job but suggested Raymond A. Palmer, an active local science fiction fan. Palmer was hired that February, taking over editorial duties with the June issue. Ziff-Davis launched &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;, a fantasy companion to &quot;Amazing&quot;, in May 1939, also under Palmer&#x27;s editorship. Palmer quickly managed to improve &quot;Amazing&#x27;s&quot; circulation, and in November 1938, the magazine went monthly again, though this did not last throughout Palmer&#x27;s tenure: between 1944 and 1946 the magazine was bimonthly and then quarterly for a while before returning to a longer-lasting monthly schedule.

===1940s===
In September 1943, Richard Shaver, an &quot;Amazing&quot; reader, began to correspond with Palmer, who soon asked him to write stories for the magazine. Shaver responded with a story called &quot;I Remember Lemuria&quot;, published in the March 1945 issue, which was presented by Palmer as a mixture of truth and fiction. The story, about prehistoric civilizations, dramatically boosted &quot;Amazing&quot;″s circulation, and Palmer ran a new Shaver story in every issue, culminating in a special issue in June 1947 devoted entirely to the Shaver Mystery, as it was called. &quot;Amazing&quot; soon drew ridicule for these stories. A derisive article by William S. Baring-Gould in the September 1946 issue of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; prompted William Ziff to tell Palmer to limit the amount of Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer complied, but his interest (and possibly belief) in this sort of material was now significant, and he soon began planning to leave Ziff-Davis. In 1947 he formed Clark Publications, launching &quot;Fate&quot; the following year, and in 1949 he resigned from Ziff-Davis to edit that and other magazines.

Howard Browne, who had been on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by throwing away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving &quot;Amazing&quot; upmarket, and his argument was strengthened by Street &amp; Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, largely as a result of the success of pocketbooks, and Street &amp; Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of &quot;Amazing&quot; in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.

===1950s===

Browne&#x27;s interest in &quot;Amazing&quot; declined when the project to turn it into a slick magazine was derailed. Although he stayed involved with &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;, another Ziff-Davis magazine, he left the editing work on &quot;Amazing&quot; to William Hamling and Lila Shaffer. In December 1950, when Ziff-Davis moved their offices from Chicago to New York, Hamling stayed behind in Chicago, and Browne revived his involvement with the magazine.

In 1952, Browne convinced Ziff-Davis to try a high-quality digest fantasy magazine. &quot;Fantastic&quot;, which appeared in the summer of that year, focused on fantasy rather than science fiction and was so successful that it persuaded Ziff-Davis to switch &quot;Amazing&quot; from pulp format to digest in early 1953 (while also switching to a bimonthly schedule). Circulation fell, however, and subsequent budget cuts limited the story quality in both &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;. &quot;Fantastic&quot; began to print science fiction as well as fantasy. Circulation increased as a result, but Browne, who was not a science fiction aficionado, once again lost interest in the magazines.

Paul W. Fairman replaced Browne as editor in September 1956. Early in Fairman&#x27;s tenure, Bernard Davis decided to try issuing a companion series of novels, titled &quot;Amazing Stories Science Fiction Novels&quot;. Readers&#x27; letters in &quot;Amazing&quot; had indicated a desire for novels, which &quot;Amazing&quot; did not have room to run. The novel series did not last; only one, Henry Slesar&#x27;s &quot;20 Million Miles to Earth&quot;, appeared. However, in response to readers&#x27; interest in longer fiction, Ziff-Davis expanded &quot;Amazing&quot; by 16 pages, starting with the March 1958 issue, and the magazine began to run complete novels.

Fairman left to edit &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; at the end of 1958, and his place was taken by Cele Goldsmith. Goldsmith had been hired in 1955 as a secretary and became assistant editor to help cope with the additional work created when Ziff-Davis launched two short-lived magazines, &quot;Dream World&quot; and &quot;Pen Pals&quot;, in 1956. Ziff-Davis were not confident of Goldsmith&#x27;s abilities as an editor, so when Fairman left, a consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was hired to work with her. She performed well and Lobsenz&#x27;s involvement soon became minimal.

===1960s===

Goldsmith is well regarded by science fiction historians for her innovation, and the impact she had on the early careers of writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Roger Zelazny, but circulation lagged during her tenure. By 1964 &quot;Fantastic&quot;″s circulation was down to 27,000, with &quot;Amazing&quot; doing little better. The following March both &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; were sold to Ultimate Publishing Company, run by Sol Cohen and Arthur Bernhard. Goldsmith was given the choice of going with the magazines or staying with Ziff-Davis; she stayed, and Cohen hired Joseph Wrzos to edit the magazines, starting with the August and September 1965 issues of &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;, respectively. Wrzos used the name &quot;Joseph Ross&quot; on the mastheads to avoid mis-spellings. Both magazines immediately moved to a bi-monthly schedule.

Cohen had acquired reprint rights to the magazines&#x27; back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as &quot;Great Science Fiction&quot; and &quot;Science Fiction Classics&quot;, but no payment was made to authors for any of these reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), a professional writers&#x27; organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for a boycott of Ultimate&#x27;s magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen&#x27;s negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. &quot;SF Impulse&quot;, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen&#x27;s agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out by the end of the year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.

By February 1968 Harrison decided to leave, as Cohen was showing no signs of abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and suggested Barry N. Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from his work at the Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought that he might be more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White&#x27;s agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.

===1970s===

When White took over as editor, &quot;Amazing&quot;″s circulation was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low ebb for subscriptions; &quot;Analog&quot;, by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen&#x27;s wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden on his wife. White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen&#x27;s lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the typeface to increase the amount of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both &quot;Fantastic&quot; and &quot;Amazing&quot; to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.

In 1972, White changed the title to &quot;Amazing Science Fiction&quot;, distancing the magazine slightly from some of the pulp connotations of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. White worked at a low wage, and his friends often read manuscripts for free, but despite his efforts the circulation continued to fall. From near 40,000 when White joined the magazine, the circulation fell to about 23,000 in October 1975. White was unwilling to continue with the very limited financial backing that Cohen provided, and he resigned in 1975. Cohen was able to convince White to remain; White promised to stay for one more year, but in the event remained as editor until late 1978.

&quot;Amazing&quot; raised its price from 75 cents to $1.00 with the November 1975 issue. The schedule switched to quarterly beginning with the March 1976 issue; as a result, the 50th anniversary issue had a cover date of June 1976. In 1977, &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; lost $15,000, though &quot;Amazing&quot;″s circulation (at nearly 26,000) was as good as it had been for several years. Cohen looked for a new publisher to buy the magazines, but in September of the following year sold his half-share in the company to his partner, Arthur Bernhard. White had occasionally suggested to Cohen that &quot;Amazing&quot; would benefit from a redesign and investment; he made the same suggestions to Bernhard in early October. According to White, Bernhard not only said no, but told him he would not receive a salary until the next issue was turned in. In late 1978 White resigned, and returned all manuscripts in his possession to their authors, even if copy-edited and ready for publication. White claimed Bernhard had told him to do this, though Bernhard denied it.

===1980s to 2000s===

Elinor Mavor took over as editor in early 1979. She had worked for Bernhard as an illustrator and in the production department of several of his magazines, though not for &quot;Amazing&quot;. She had also been an editor at &quot;Bill of Fare&quot;, a restaurant trade magazine. Mavor had read a good deal of science fiction but knew nothing about the world of science fiction magazines when she took over. She was not confident that a woman would be accepted as the editor of a science fiction magazine, so she initially used the pseudonym &quot;Omar Gohagen&quot; for both &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;, dropping it late in 1980. Circulation continued to fall, and Bernhard refused to consider Mavor&#x27;s request to undertake a subscription drive. Instead, in late 1980, Bernhard decided to merge the two magazines. &quot;Fantastic&quot;″s last independent issue was in October; thereafter the combined magazine returned to a bimonthly schedule. At the same time the title was changed to &quot;Amazing Science Fiction Stories&quot;. Bernhard cut Mavor&#x27;s salary after the merger, as she was editing only one magazine. Despite this, she stayed with &quot;Amazing&quot;, but was unable to prevent circulation from dropping again, down to only 11,000 newsstand sales in 1982.

Shortly after the merger, Bernhard decided to retire, and approached Edward Ferman, the editor of &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, and Joel Davis, at Davis Publications, among others, about a possible sale of &quot;Amazing&quot;. Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, believed he had concluded a deal with Bernhard, and began to advertise for submissions, but the negotiations failed. Bernhard also approached George H. Scithers, who declined, but put Bernhard in touch with Gary Gygax of TSR. On 27 May 1982 TSR, Inc. acquired the trademarks and copyrights of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Scithers was taken on by TSR as editor beginning with the November issue. He was replaced by Patrick Lucien Price in September 1986, and then by Kim Mohan in May 1991. TSR ceased publication of &quot;Amazing&quot; with the Winter 1995 issue, but in 1997, shortly after they were acquired by Wizards of the Coast, the magazine was relaunched, again with Mohan as editor. This version lasted for only ten issues, though it did include a special celebratory 600th issue in early 2000. The science fiction trade journal &quot;Locus&quot; commented in an early review that distribution of the magazine seemed to be weak. The title proved unable to survive: the last issue of this version was dated Summer 2000. The title was then acquired by Paizo Publishing, who launched a new monthly version in September 2004. The February 2005 issue was the last printed; a March issue was released in PDF format, and in March 2006 Paizo announced that it would no longer publish &quot;Amazing&quot;. In September 2011, the trademark for &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; was acquired by Steve Davidson. Two online issues appeared, in July and August 2012, followed by another in 2014. Davidson relaunched print publication of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; with the Fall 2018 issue with Ira Nayman as editor. In 2022 Davidson stepped down as publisher for personal reasons and former Creative Director, Kermit Woodall, took over as publisher.

==Contents and reception==
===Gernsback era===
Gernsback&#x27;s editorial in the first issue asserted that &quot;not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading—they are also always instructive&quot;. He had always believed that &quot;scientifiction&quot;, as he called these stories, had educational power, but he now understood that the fiction had to entertain as well as to instruct. His continued belief in the instructional value of science fiction was not in keeping with the general attitude of the public towards pulp magazines, which was that they were &quot;trash&quot;.

The first issue of &quot;Amazing&quot; contained only reprints, beginning with a serialization of &quot;Off on a Comet&quot;, by Jules Verne. In keeping with Gernsback&#x27;s new approach, this was one of Verne&#x27;s least scientifically plausible novels. Also included were H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The New Accelerator&quot;, and Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar&quot;; Gernsback put the names of all three authors on the cover. He also reprinted three more recent stories. Two came from his own magazine, &quot;Science and Invention&quot;; these were &quot;The Man from the Atom&quot; by G. Peyton Wertenbaker and &quot;The Thing from—&#x27;Outside by George Allan England. The third was Austin Hall&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Saved the Earth&quot;, which had appeared in &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;.

In the June 1926 issue Gernsback launched a competition to write a short story to suit a cover drawn by illustrator Frank R. Paul, with a first prize of $250. The competition drew over 360 entries, seven of which were eventually printed in &quot;Amazing&quot;. The winner was Cyril G. Wates, who sold three more stories to Gernsback in the late 1920s. Two other entrants went on to become successful writers: one was Clare Winger Harris, whose story, &quot;The Fate of the Poseidonia&quot;, took third place in the competition, and was published in the June 1927 issue as by &quot;Mrs. F.C. Harris&quot;. The other notable entrant was A. Hyatt Verrill, with &quot;The Voice from the Inner World&quot;, which appeared in July 1927.

A letter column, titled &quot;Discussions&quot; soon appeared, and became a regular feature with the January 1927 issue. Many science fiction readers were isolated in small communities, knowing nobody else who liked the same fiction. Gernsback&#x27;s habit of publishing the full address of all his correspondents meant that the letter column allowed fans to correspond with each other directly. Science fiction fandom traces its beginnings to the letter column in &quot;Amazing&quot; and its competitors, and one historian of the field, author Lester del Rey, has commented that the introduction of this letter column &quot;may have been one of the most important events in the history of science fiction&quot;.

For the first year, &quot;Amazing&quot; contained primarily reprinted material. It was proving difficult to attract new, high-quality material, and Gernsback&#x27;s slowness at paying his authors did not help. Writers such as H.P. Lovecraft, H.G. Wells, and Murray Leinster all avoided &quot;Amazing&quot; because Gernsback took so long to pay for the stories he printed. The slow payments were probably known to many of the other active pulp writers, which would have further limited the volume of submissions. New writers did appear, but the quality of their stories was often weak.

Frederik Pohl later said that Gernsback&#x27;s magazine published &quot;the kind of stories Gernsback himself used to write: a sort of animated catalogue of gadgets&quot;. Gernsback discovered that the audience he had attracted was less interested in scientific invention stories than in fantastical adventures. A. Merritt&#x27;s &quot;The Moon Pool&quot;, which began serialization in May 1927, was an early success; there was little or no scientific basis to the story, but it was very popular with &quot;Amazing&quot;″s readers. The covers, all of which were painted by Paul, were garish and juvenile, leading some readers to complain. Raymond Palmer, later to become an editor of the magazine, wrote that a friend of his was forced to stop buying &quot;Amazing&quot; &quot;by reason of his parents&#x27; dislike of the cover illustrations&quot;. Gernsback experimented with a more sober cover for the September 1928 issue, but it sold poorly, and so the lurid covers continued. The combination of poor quality fiction with garish artwork has led some critics to comment that Gernsback created a &quot;ghetto&quot; for science fiction, though it has also been argued that the creation of a specialized market allowed science fiction to develop and mature as a genre.

Among the regular writers for &quot;Amazing&quot; by the end of the 1920s were several who were influential and popular at the time, such as David H. Keller and Stanton Coblentz, and some who would continue to be successful for much longer, most notably Edward E. Smith and Jack Williamson. Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Skylark of Space&quot;, written between 1915 and 1920, was a seminal space opera that found no ready market when &quot;Argosy&quot; stopped printing science fiction. When Smith saw a copy of the April 1927 issue of &quot;Amazing&quot;, he submitted it to Sloane, and it appeared in the August–October 1928 issues. It was such a success that Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published. It was also in the August 1928 issue that &quot;Armageddon – 2419 AD&quot;, by Philip Francis Nowlan, appeared; this was the first appearance of Buck Rogers in print.

===Sloane, Palmer, Browne and Fairman===
Sloane took over full control of the content of &quot;Amazing&quot; when Gernsback left in 1929. He was infamous for his slow response to manuscripts, and when &quot;Astounding Stories&quot; was launched in January 1930, with better rates and faster editorial response, some of Sloane&#x27;s writers quickly defected. Little of quality appeared in &quot;Amazing&quot; during Sloane&#x27;s tenure, though &quot;The Lost Machine&quot;, an early story by John Wyndham, appeared in April 1932, under Wyndham&#x27;s real name of John Beynon Harris. John W. Campbell and Howard Fast sold their first stories to Sloane; Campbell&#x27;s &quot;When the Atoms Failed&quot; appeared in the January 1930 issue, and Fast&#x27;s &quot;Wrath of the Purple&quot; was printed in the October 1932 issue.

Raymond Palmer, who took over in 1938 after production of the magazine was moved to Chicago, was less interested in the educational possibilities of science fiction than Sloane had been. He wanted the magazine to provide escapist entertainment, and had no interest in scientific accuracy. His terse instruction—&quot;Gimme Bang-Bang&quot;—to one pulp writer sums up his approach. Palmer disposed of almost all of Sloane&#x27;s accumulated inventory, instead acquiring stories from local Chicago writers he knew through his connections with science fiction fandom. He also added features such as a &quot;Correspondence Corner&quot; and a &quot;Collectors&#x27; Corner&quot; to appeal to fans, and introduced a &quot;Meet the Authors&quot; feature, though on at least one occasion the featured author was a pseudonym, and the biographical details were invented. An illustrated back cover was tried, and soon became standard. In 1939 Palmer acquired Isaac Asimov&#x27;s first sale, &quot;Marooned off Vesta&quot;.

In the 1940s, several writers established themselves as a stable of reliable contributors to &quot;Amazing&quot;. These included David Wright O&#x27;Brien and William P. McGivern, both of whom wrote an immense amount for Ziff-Davis, much of it under house names such as Alexander Blade. John Russell Fearn became a prolific contributor, using the pseudonyms &quot;Thornton Ayre&quot; and &quot;Polton Cross&quot;. Palmer also encouraged long-time science fiction writers to return, publishing pulp authors such as Ed Earl Repp and Eando Binder. This policy did not always meet with approval from &quot;Amazing&quot;″s readers, who, despite a clear preference for action and adventure stories, could not stomach the work of some of the early pulp writers such as Harry Bates.
The first Shaver Mystery story, &quot;I Remember Lemuria&quot;, by Richard S. Shaver, appeared in the March 1945 issue. Shaver claimed that all the world&#x27;s accidents and disasters were caused by an ancient race of deros (short for &quot;detrimental robots&quot;) who lived in underground cities. This explanation for the world&#x27;s ills, coming towards the end of World War II, struck a chord with &quot;Amazing&quot;″s readership. Palmer received over 2,500 letters, instead of the usual 40 or 50, and proceeded to print a Shaver story in every issue. The June 1947 issue was given over entirely to the Shaver Mystery. From March 1948 the Shaver Mystery was dropped as a regular feature of the magazine, at Ziff&#x27;s insistence. Palmer left the following year, and Browne, his successor, &quot;was determined to make sure that the lunatics were no longer in charge of the asylum&quot;, in the words of science fiction historian Mike Ashley.

Browne had acquired some good-quality material in the process of planning the launch of a new slick version of &quot;Amazing&quot;, and when the plan was abandoned this material appeared in the continuing pulp version. This included &quot;Operation RSVP&quot; by H. Beam Piper, and &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot; by Isaac Asimov. Despite the cancellation of the planned change to a slick format, news had reached the writing community of &quot;Amazing&quot;″s new approach, and Browne began to receive much better material than Palmer had been able to publish. The existing stable of &quot;Amazing&quot; writers, such as Rog Phillips and Chester S. Geier, were replaced by writers such as Fritz Leiber, Fredric Brown, and Clifford D. Simak. Browne also discovered several writers who went on to success in the field, publishing first stories by Walter M. Miller, Mack Reynolds, John Jakes, Milton Lesser and Charles Beaumont, all within nine months in late 1950 and early 1951. Browne was disappointed by the cancellation of the planned slick version, and to some extent reverted to Palmer&#x27;s policy of publishing sensational fiction. In 1952, for example, he serialized the anonymous &quot;Master of the Universe&quot;, which purported to be a history of the future from 1975 to 2575.

With the change to digest size in 1953, Browne once again attempted to use higher-quality fiction. The first digest issue, dated April–May 1953, included stories by Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, Richard Matheson, Theodore Sturgeon, and Murray Leinster. Further well-regarded stories appeared over the course of 1953, including Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Encounter in the Dawn&quot;, and Henry Kuttner&#x27;s &quot;Or Else&quot;. Subsequent budget cuts meant that Browne was unable to sustain this level. As in the 1940s, &quot;Amazing&quot; gained a stable of writers who appeared frequently, though this time the quality of the writers was rather higher—it included Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, and Randall Garrett—and the regular writers were not appearing only in Ziff-Davis magazines. This remained the situation after Browne&#x27;s departure in 1956 and through Paul Fairman&#x27;s tenure.

===Cele Goldsmith===
Cele Goldsmith&#x27;s tenure as editor began with the opportunity to showcase two very well-established writers: E.E. Smith and Isaac Asimov. Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Galaxy Primes&quot; was serialized from March to May 1959. Asimov&#x27;s first published story &quot;Marooned off Vesta&quot; had appeared in the March 1939 &quot;Amazing&quot;, and Goldsmith reprinted it in March 1959 along with a sequel &quot;Anniversary&quot; and Asimov&#x27;s comments. She soon began to publish some of the better new writers. Cordwainer Smith&#x27;s &quot;Golden the Ship Was—Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot; appeared in April; and by the middle of the following year she had managed to attract stories from Robert Sheckley, Alan E. Nourse, Fritz Leiber, Gordon R. Dickson, Robert Bloch, and James Blish. The changes she made were enough to bring Robert A. Heinlein back as a subscriber; he read the June 1961 issue, which, he wrote to her, &quot;caused me to think I had been missing something&quot;.
In September 1960, &quot;Amazing&quot; began to carry Sam Moskowitz&#x27;s series of author profiles, which had begun in &quot;Fantastic&quot;, the sister magazine. The following month the cover and logo were redesigned. In April 1961, the 35th anniversary of the first issue, Goldsmith ran several reprints, including by Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Goldsmith had little previous experience with science fiction, and bought what she liked, rather than trying to conform to a notion of what science fiction should be. The result was the debut of more significant writers in her magazines than anywhere else at that time: she published the first stories of Ursula K. Le Guin, Roger Zelazny, Piers Anthony and Thomas M. Disch, among many others. Award-winning stories published during Goldsmith&#x27;s editorship include Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;He Who Shapes&quot;, a novella about the use of dream therapy to cure phobias. It was serialized in the January and February 1965 issues, and won a Nebula Award from the newly established Science Fiction Writers of America. Goldsmith often wrote long, helpful letters to her authors: Zelazny commented in a letter to her that &quot;most of anything I have learned was stimulated by those first sales, and then I learned, and possibly even learned more, from some of the later rejections&quot;. Disch and Le Guin have also acknowledged the influence Goldsmith had on their early careers; Le Guin called her in 1975 &quot;as enterprising and perceptive an editor as the science fiction magazines ever had&quot;.

Goldsmith&#x27;s open-minded approach meant that &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; published some writers who did not fit into the other magazines. Philip K. Dick&#x27;s sales to magazines had dropped, but his work began to appear in &quot;Amazing&quot;, and Goldsmith also regularly published David R. Bunch&#x27;s stories of Moderan, a world whose inhabitants were part human and part metal. Bunch, whose stories were &quot;bewildering, exotic word pictures&quot; according to Mike Ashley, had been unable to sell regularly elsewhere.

The cover art for &quot;Amazing&quot; had been largely supplied by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers for the first few years of &quot;Amazing&quot;, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.

===Reprint era and Ted White===

When Sol Cohen bought both &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; in early 1965, he decided to maximize profits by filling the magazines almost entirely with reprints. Cohen had acquired second serial rights from Ziff-Davis to all stories that had been printed in both magazines, and also in the companion magazines such as &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;. Joseph Wrzos, the new editor, persuaded Cohen that at least one new story should appear in each issue; there was sufficient inventory left over from Goldsmith&#x27;s tenure for this to be done without acquiring new material. Readers initially approved of the policy, since it made available some well-loved stories from earlier decades that had not been reprinted elsewhere. Both of Wrzos&#x27;s successors, Harry Harrison and Barry Malzberg, were unable to persuade Cohen to use more new fiction.

When Ted White took over, it was on condition that the reprints be phased out. This took some time: for a while both &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; continued to include one reprint every issue; with the May 1972 issue the transformation was complete, and all stories were new. As well as eliminating the reprints, White reintroduced features such as a letter column and &quot;The Clubhouse&quot;, a fanzine review and fannish news column. He continued the book review column, and a series of science articles by Gregory Benford and David Book. White also redesigned the look of the magazine, making it, in sf historian Mike Ashley&#x27;s words, &quot;far more modern and sophisticated&quot;.

White was willing to print a variety of fiction, mixing traditional stories with more experimental material that was influenced by the British New Wave or by 1960s psychedelia. In 1971, he serialized Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot;, about a man whose dreams can modify reality. One writer influenced by this was James Tiptree, Jr., who later wrote that &quot;after first plowing into the first pulpy pages of the 1971 &quot;Amazing&quot; in which &quot;Lathe&quot; came out, my toe-nails began to curl under and my spine hair stood up&quot;. White&#x27;s willingness to experiment led to &quot;Amazing&quot; running more stories with sexual content than other magazines. One such story, White&#x27;s own &quot;Growing Up Fast in the City&quot;, was criticized as pornographic by some of &quot;Amazing&quot;″s readers. Other stories, such as Rich Brown&#x27;s &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, about the violent rape of a black woman and the subsequent death of her rapists, also led to controversy. White printed more conventional fiction as well, much of it high quality. The magazine was nominated for the Hugo Award (a readers&#x27; award, named for Hugo Gernsback) for best editor three times during his tenure (1970, 1971 and 1972), finishing third each time.

White&#x27;s ability to attract new writers suffered because of the low rates he paid: one cent per word, as compared to three or five cents per word at the leading competitive magazines. To compensate, White cultivated new writers whose experimental work was not selling elsewhere. He made a deal in 1971 with Gordon Eklund, who was hesitating to become a full-time writer because of the financial risks. White agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. The result was that much of Eklund&#x27;s fiction appeared in &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot; over the next few years.

&quot;Amazing&quot;″s reputation had been for formulaic science fiction almost since it began, but White was able to take the magazine to a higher standard than any other editor except Cele Goldsmith, and gave &quot;Amazing&quot; a respected position in the field. His successors were not able to maintain the same level of quality.

===After Ted White===
When Elinor Mavor took over, in early 1979, she had no experience with science fiction magazines, and was unaware of the history of bad feeling within the science fiction community about the poor payments for reprinted stories. She was given an extremely limited budget to work with, and had few stories on hand to work with initially, and as a result her first issues contained several reprints. Mavor experimented in her first year with some new ideas, such as starting a story on the back cover in order to hook readers into buying the magazine to finish the story. She also began a serial story in graphic format that used reader input to continue its plot. It was not a success and &quot;thankfully&quot;, according to Mike Ashley, the experiment was terminated after only three episodes.

Over time Mavor was to some extent able to reverse the negative perceptions of &quot;Amazing&quot; among established authors, but she was initially forced to work primarily with newer writers. Early discoveries of hers include Michael P. Kube-McDowell, John E. Stith and Richard Paul Russo. In a notice published in her first issue, she asked readers for help in assembling news, reviews and fan information, and soon added columns that covered these areas. In 1981 Robert Silverberg began a series of opinion columns. The artwork was of high quality, including work by Stephen Fabian, and later by David Mattingly.

After the merger with &quot;Fantastic&quot;, Mavor continued to draw well-known writers to the magazine, including Orson Scott Card, George R. R. Martin, and Roger Zelazny. Brad Linaweaver&#x27;s &quot;Moon of Ice&quot;, which appeared in March 1982, was nominated for a Nebula Award; Martin&#x27;s &quot;Unsound Variations&quot;, which had appeared the issue before, was nominated for both a Nebula and a Hugo award.

Historian James Gunn&#x27;s assessment of &quot;Amazing&quot; in the 1980s is that Mavor, Scithers and Price, who between them edited &quot;Amazing&quot; for a decade, were unable to sustain the standards established by Ted White in the 1970s. Brian Stableford, by contrast, comments that both Scithers and Price made efforts to publish good material, and that the packaging, from 1991 onwards, was perhaps the best presented of any science fiction magazine.

With the Wizards of the Coast relaunch in 1998 the contents, under editor Kim Mohan, became more media-focused. The initial plan was to have two or three stories per issue based on films, TV, and games. The 600th issue, in early 2000, included a Harlan Ellison story, as well as a story from the 100th issue, the 200th issue, and so on, up to the 500th issue. Pamela Sargent also contributed a story. The Paizo publishing relaunch, in 2004, was even more focused on media content than the Wizards of the Coast version had been, with much more movie and comics-related material than science fiction. Several well-known authors appeared in the first issue, including Harlan Ellison, Bruce Sterling, and Gene Wolfe. Paizo also ran a blog for the magazine. The fiction received positive reviews, but Paizo soon put the magazine on temporary hold, and canceled it permanently the following year. The title remained in limbo until Steve Davidson&#x27;s online version appeared in 2012.

===Influence on the field===
&quot;Amazing Stories&quot; was influential simply by being the first of its kind. In the words of science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, the magazine was &quot;a snag in the stream of history, from which a V-shape spread out in dozens and then in hundreds of altered lives&quot;. Many early fans of the field began to communicate with each other through the letter column, and to publish fanzines—amateur fan publications that helped establish connections among fans across the country. Many of these fans in turn became successful writers; and the existence of an organized science fiction fandom, and of writers such as Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov, who came to writing directly from fandom, can be dated to the creation of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. After the first few years, when there was little or no competition, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; never again led the field in the eyes of critics or fans. Despite its long history, the magazine rarely contributed much to science fiction beyond the initial creation of the genre, though Gernsback himself is commemorated in the name &quot;Hugo&quot;, which is the almost universally used term for the World Science Fiction Society&#x27;s annually presented Science Fiction Achievement Awards. Gernsback has also been called the &quot;Father of Science Fiction&quot; for his role in creating &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

==Publication details==
===Editors===
Bibliographers do not always agree who should be listed as editor of any given issue of &quot;Amazing&quot;. For example, Gernsback was in control for the first three years, but Sloane performed all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. Bernard Davis held the title of &quot;Editor&quot; of all Ziff-Davis magazines when at that company, with the actual editing of the magazines done by respective &quot;Managing Editors&quot;. The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes added. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.
* Hugo Gernsback (April 1926 – April 1929). Sloane performed almost all the editorial duties related to fiction.
* Arthur Lynch (May 1929 – October 1929). As under Gernsback, Sloane was essentially the editor during Lynch&#x27;s tenure.
* T. O&#x27;Conor Sloane (November 1929 – May 1938)
* Raymond A. Palmer (June 1938 – December 1949)
* Howard Browne (January 1950 – August 1956). Fairman actually took over editorial duties with the May or June 1956 issue.
* Paul W. Fairman (September 1956 – November 1958)
* Cele Goldsmith Lalli (December 1958 – June 1965). Norman Lobsenz was introduced as editor, but in fact Cele Goldsmith did all the editorial work. When she married she used her married name of Cele Lalli.
* Joseph Ross (August 1965 – October 1967). A pseudonym for Joseph Wrzos.
* Harry Harrison (December 1967 – September 1968)
* Barry N. Malzberg (November 1968 – January 1969)
* Ted White (March 1969 – February 1979)
* Elinor Mavor (May 1979 – September 1982). From May 1979 to August 1981 Mavor used the pseudonym Omar Gohagen; subsequently she used her real name.
* George H. Scithers (November 1982 – July 1986)
* Patrick Lucien Price (September 1986 – March 1991)
* Kim Mohan (May 1991 – Winter 1995 and Summer 1998 – Summer 2000)
* Dave Gross (September 2004 – December 2004)
* Jeff Berkwits (January 2005 – March 2005)
* Steve Davidson (July 2012 – August 2018)
* Ira Nayman (August 2018 – November 2022)
* Lloyd Penney (November 2022 to present)

===Other bibliographic details===
&quot;Amazing&quot; began as a bedsheet format magazine and remained so until October 1933, when it switched to pulp size. With the April–May 1953 issue &quot;Amazing&quot; became a digest. Seven issues in the early 1980s, from November 1980 to November 1981, were a half-inch taller than the regular digest size, but thereafter the magazine reverted to the standard digest format. In May 1991 the magazine returned to a large format, but this lasted only until the Winter 1994 issue, and the next three issues were digest-sized again. When the magazine reappeared in 1998, it was in bedsheet format and remained that size until the very end. The last issue, March 2005, was distributed only as a PDF download, never as a physical magazine. The volume numbering contained some irregularities: the numbering given in the tables above appears to be in error for the period from 1979 to 1983, but in fact it is given correctly in the table. Vol. 27 no. 8 was a single issue, not two, as it seems to be from the table; it was dated Dec 1953/Jan 1954.

The title of the magazine changed several times:

Two different series of reprints of &quot;Amazing&quot; appeared in the United Kingdom. First came a single undated issue from Ziff-Davis, in November 1946. In June 1950, Thorpe &amp; Porter began a second series that lasted until 1954, and totalled 32 issues. The Ziff-Davis issue and the first 24 issues from Thorpe &amp; Porter were pulp-sized; the last eight were digests. The Thorpe &amp; Porter issues were undated, but the pulp issues were numbered from 1 to 24, and were initially bimonthly. The March 1951 issue was followed by April and November, however, and in 1952 issues appeared in February, March, April, June, July, September and November. 1953 saw nine pulp issues, omitting only March and May; and with December came the change to digest-size and a perfectly regular bimonthly schedule that lasted until February 1955. These last eight issues were numbered volume 1, numbers 1 to 8. There was also a Canadian edition, which lasted for 24 issues, from September 1933 to August 1935, from Teck Publications; these were identical to the US editions except that the front covers were overprinted with &quot;Printed in Canada on Canadian Paper&quot;. A Japanese edition ran for seven issues in mid-1950, selecting stories from &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot; as well as from &quot;Amazing&quot;.

From 1940 to 1943, and again from 1947 to 1951, copies of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; were rebound, three at a time, and resold as &quot;Amazing Stories Quarterly&quot;. A total of 27 of these issues appeared; they should not be confused with the magazine of the same name which ran from 1928 to 1934 as a companion to &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;.

Several anthologies of stories from &quot;Amazing&quot; have been published, including:

===Media crossovers===
Director Steven Spielberg licensed the title for use on an American television show called &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; that ran from 1985 to 1987. In 2020, a revival of the show debuted on Apple TV+.

Between 1998 and 2000, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; published a series of short stories based upon the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In 2002, these stories were reissued by Pocket Books in the collection &quot;Star Trek: The Amazing Stories&quot;.

<text>Stress management consists of a wide spectrum of techniques and psychotherapies aimed at controlling a person&#x27;s level of psychological stress, especially chronic stress, generally for the purpose of improving the function of everyday life. Stress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual&#x27;s situational factors. These can include a decline in physical health, such as headaches, chest pain, fatigue, sleep problems, and depression. The process of stress management is a key factor that can lead to a happy and successful life in modern society. Stress management provides numerous ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.

There are several models of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress. Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.

==Management Techniques==

Many stress management techniques cope with stresses one may find themselves withstanding. Some of the following ways reduce a higher than usual stress level temporarily, to compensate the biological issues involved; others face the stressors at a higher level of abstraction:

Some stresses are caused by high demand levels that load the person with extra effort and work. in this case, a new time schedule can be worked up, limiting the normal frequency and duration of former schedules until the period of abnormally high personal demand has passed.

Techniques of stress management will vary according to the philosophical paradigm.

==Historical foundations ==
Walter Cannon and Hans Selye used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.

Subsequent studies of stress in humans by Richard Rahe and others established that stress is caused by distinct, measurable life stressors, and that these life stressors can be ranked by the median degree of stress they produce (leading to the Holmes and Rahe stress scale). Holmes and Rahe is focused on how life&#x27;s stressors can influence ones health and wellness. The scale was developed to measure the effects of stress on health using life change units, in an attempt to quantify stress and its correlation to illness.Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead, their effect is mediated by the individual&#x27;s perceptions, capacities, and understanding.

There are several models of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress. Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.

==Models==

The generalized models are:
* The emergency response/fight-or-flight response by Walter Cannon (1914, 1932)
* General Adaptation Syndrome by Hans Selye (1936)
* Stress Model of Henry and Stephens (1977)
* Transactional (or cognitive) Stress Model / stress model of Lazarus after Lazarus (1974)
* Theory of resource conservation by Stevan Hobfoll (1988, 1998; Hobfoll &amp; Buchwald, 2004)

===Transactional model===
In 1981, Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman suggested that stress can be thought of as resulting from an &quot;imbalance between demands and resources&quot; or as occurring when &quot;pressure exceeds one&#x27;s perceived ability to cope&quot;. Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather an individual&#x27;s resources and abilities to cope and mediate the stress response which are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.Among the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:
* Conflicts in company
* How the company treats co-workers

In order to develop an effective stress management program, it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman&#x27;s interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressors if the person does not perceive the stressors as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate coping skills, then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressors. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressors and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of the types of stressors.

===Health realization/innate health model===
The health realization/innate health model of stress is founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual&#x27;s appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person&#x27;s thought processes that determines the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one&#x27;s circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of well-being results from approaching the world with a &quot;quiet mind&quot;. This theory deposits that moods fluctuate and cannot be changed by a specific pattern of thinking. Mental discomfort is only deepened by focus on how to change one&#x27;s mood, so moods should be &quot;waited out&quot; and dwelling avoided based on this framework. This model proposes that helping stressed individuals understand the nature of thought—especially providing them with the ability to recognize when they are in the grip of insecure thinking, disengage from it, and access natural positive feelings—will reduce their stress.

===Stress prevention and resilience===
Although many techniques have traditionally been developed to deal with the consequences of stress, considerable research has also been conducted on the prevention of stress, a subject closely related to psychological resilience-building. A number of self-help approaches to stress-prevention and resilience-building have been developed, drawing mainly on the theory and practice of cognitive-behavioral therapy.

===Measuring stress===
There are different ways to measure stress levels. One way is through psychological testing. The Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale is used to rate stressful life events and how life stressors influence illness. The DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in blood pressure and galvanic skin response can also be measured to test stress levels. A digital thermometer can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the fight-or-flight response drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual. This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic .

Despite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable; using various physiological tests, similar to those used in polygraphs. An example of stress being measured is using nano EEG sensors in detecting stress.

===Effectiveness===
Stress management has physiological and immune benefits.

Positive outcomes are observed using a combination of non-drug interventions:
* treatment of anger or hostility,
* autogenic training which is a relaxation technique used to reduce stress and bring the mind and the body into balance through repeated exercises, such as deep breathing, to promote mental relaxation. Research done by L. Varvogli and C. Darviri shows that this technique has several therapeutic health benefits aiding in those that experienced tension headaches, heart disease, anxiety, and many others.
* talking therapy (around relationship or existential issues)
* biofeedback allows people to monitor their bodies internal function such as, heart rate, muscle tension, temperature, and use this information to learn how to control the bodies response which can lead to better physical, mental, and emotional health. Some consider it to be effective however critics have compared its efficacy to that of conventional therapies as well as the cost effectiveness of biofeedback is uncertain. 
* cognitive therapy for anxiety or clinical depression

== Stress management programs ==
Many businesses have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipment adapting to stress in the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries and stress relieving gadgets. Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses try to reduce the stress levels of their employees. One way is through individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors of the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.

Employee assistance programs can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individuals stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.

Another way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee, or even giving them more control as to when or where they work. 

Improving communications between employees is very effective for helping reduce stress. Making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, by giving them a voice in bigger situations shows trust and value in their opinion. Having all the employees cooperate with each other is an underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.

Intervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.

==Types of stress==

===Acute stress===
Acute stress is the most common form of stress among humans worldwide. It deals with the pressures of the near future or the very recent past. While acute stress is often interpreted as being a negative experience, it can actually be beneficial and even necessary for one&#x27;s wellbeing because of its protective effects against potentially dangerous threats. Slamming on the brakes while driving in order to avoid a car accident could be considered a moment of beneficial acute stress. Running or any other form of exercise would also be considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.

===Chronic stress===
Unlike acute stress, which only lasts for a moment, chronic stress lasts for longer time spans. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time.

Chronic stress can lead to memory loss, damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. Additional symptoms of chronic stress include aches and pains, insomnia or other sleep disturbances, changes in social behaviors, low energy, emotional withdrawal or other changes in emotional responses, and unfocused thinking. Chronic stress has also been associated with other medical conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and arthritis.

The severity varies from person to person. Gender difference can also be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes. Men can deal with shorter stress duration better than women can. If men hit a certain threshold, the chances of them developing mental issues increase drastically.

Chronic stress is a major health issue that affects people of all ages and can have profound effects on physical and mental health. It is a long-standing, unrelieved, and unavoidable stress, that include busy work, school schedules, and complex relationships. Over time, chronic stress can alter the body&#x27;s systems, leading to a variety of illnesses and conditions.

==Stress in the Workplace==

In the workplace, managing stress becomes vital in order to keep up job performance as well as relationship with co-workers and employers. For some workers, changing the work environment relieves work stress. Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress.Companies and businesses tend to be more successful when the work environment facilitates more cooperation rather than competition. In the workplace, people feel more comfortable and capable of completing the work due to their support from coworkers and employers. As a result, both companies and employees benefit from a cooperating relationship. Competition in the workplace can leave employees feeling like it is “every man for himself” which can increase stress.

Author J, Carr highlighted three areas of the workplace that affects the levels of stress experienced. Job demands, individual differences, and social demands. These areas that heighten stress are addressed in Rahe&#x27;s scale suggesting that some of the greatest stressors in life are connected to the workplace. Stress in the workplace does not always have to be negatively viewed. When managed well, stress can increase employees&#x27; focus and productivity. According to the Yerkes–Dodson law, stress is beneficial to human functioning, but only up to a point. People who experience very low levels of stress might feel under stimulated and passive, while those with excessively high levels of stress may feel overwhelmed, anxious, and irritable. Thus, establishing an optimum level of stress is key.

Organizational stress levels that an individual faces is dependent not just on external factors such as job characteristics or environment, but also on intrapersonal factors such as personality, temperament, and individual coping and thinking styles.

Also, stress at workplace is not limited to employees. Entrepreneurs also undergo stress This stress can vary from team management, business management or unfavorable policy from the government.

=== Commitment ===
Some examples of stressors in the workplace can be their perception of Organization Commitment, which is the way an employee conceptualizes his/her reasons for staying in the organizations for either Affective, Continuance, or Normative reasons. Affective commitment to the organization is the situation where an employee strongly identifies with the values and culture of the organization. While this is not directly telling of an employee&#x27;s stress levels, it is a genuine interest and enjoyment in the employee&#x27;s work and work relations that places the employee in a good position to manage stress well. Employees who stay in an organization for continuance reasons stay as a result of weighing the pros and cons, and then decides that the opportunity cost of leaving the organization is too high. Employees under this category might experience moderate levels of stress, as their reasons for staying is driven more by external rather than internal motivation. Employees who stay for normative reasons, however, are most likely to experience the highest levels of stress, as these are the employees who stay out of obligation and duty.

=== Salary ===
Salary can also be an important concern of employees. Salary can affect the way people work because they can aim for promotion and in result, a higher salary. This can lead to chronic stress.

=== Culture Differences ===
Cultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems. Eastern Asian employees may deal with certain work situations differently from how a Western North American employee would. In a study conducted in Malaysia, it was found that while the classification of workplace stress is similar between Malaysians and Western employees, the perception of workplace stress as well as the approaches to coping with stress were different.
In order to manage stress in the workplace, employers can provide stress managing programs such as therapy, communication programs, and a more flexible work schedule. There have been many studies conducted demonstrating the benefits of mindfulness practices on subjective well-being and work outcomes. Productivity, organization, and performance increase, while burnout rates decrease. Individuals who received either low or high levels of support from their supervisors for stress management usually viewed the intervention positively. This perception was described in terms of the intervention either compensating for or complementing their work environment, depending on the level of support received.

== Stress in the Medical environment ==
A study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.

In addition, there is a study that the objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between work performance and self-reported symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety among nurses working in tuberculosis (TB)/HIV and COVID-19 units on Timor Island, Indonesia. The study used a comparative, cross-sectional design and collected data between October 2020 and January 2021. The study group comprised 236 nurses working in TB/HIV isolation rooms and 423 nurses in COVID-19 isolation rooms. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale (DASS-42) and a work performance questionnaire were used to collect data, which were analyzed using independent t-testing and Pearson correlation coefficient. The results showed that the mean DASS-42 scores of nurses in TB/HIV isolation units were low, indicating minimal effects, while those in COVID-19 isolation units demonstrated moderate levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Additionally, the work performance results indicated that the nurses in the TB/HIV isolation rooms had sufficient work performance, while those in the COVID-19 isolation rooms had weaker work performance. There was a significant difference in work performance between nurses in the two units. The study concluded that there was a correlation between nurses&#x27; depression, stress, and anxiety levels and their work performance in TB/HIV and COVID-19 isolation units.

== Stress in the Aviation industry ==
Aviation is a high-stress industry, given that it requires a high level of precision at all times. Chronically high stress levels can ultimately decrease the performance and compromise safety. To be effective, stress measurement tools must be specific to the aviation industry, given its unique working environment and other stressors. Stress measurement in aviation seeks to quantify the psychological stress experienced by aviators, with the goal of making needed improvements to aviators&#x27; coping and stress management skills.

To more precisely measure stress, aviators&#x27; many responsibilities are broken down into &quot;workloads.&quot; This helps to categorize the broad concept of &quot;stress&quot; by specific stressors. Additionally, since different workloads may pose unique stressors, this method may be more effective than measuring stress levels as a whole. Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.

To evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used. The major types of measurement tools are:
# Performance-based measures;
# Subjective measures, like questionnaires which aviators answer themselves; and
# Physiological measures, like measurement of heart rate.

Implementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.

=== Measurement systems ===
The most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily rating scale-based. These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry. Different systems may be utilized in different operational specialties.

* The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) – The PSS is a widely used subjective tool for measuring stress levels. It consists of 10 questions, and asks participants to rate, on a five-point scale, how stressed they felt after a certain event. All 10 questions are summed to obtain a total score from 0 to 40. In the aviation industry, for example, it has been used with flight training students to measure how stressed they felt after flight training exercises.
* The Coping Skills Inventory – This inventory measures aviators&#x27; skills for coping with stress. This is another subjective measure, asking participants to rate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which they use eight common coping skills: Substance abuse, Emotional support, Instrumental support (help with tangible things, like child care, finances, or task sharing), Positive reframing (changing one&#x27;s thinking about a negative event, and thinking of it as a positive instead), Self-blame, Planning, Humour and Religion. An individual&#x27;s total score indicates the extent to which he or she is using effective, positive coping skills (like humor and emotional support); ineffective, negative coping skills (like substance abuse and self-blame); and where the individual could improve.
* The Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) – SWAT is a rating system used to measure individuals&#x27; perceived mental workload while performing a task, like developing instruments in a lab, multitasking aircraft duties, or conducting air defense. SWAT combines measurements and scaling techniques to develop a global rating scale.

=== Pilot stress report systems ===
Early pilot stress report systems were adapted and modified from existing psychological questionnaires and surveys. The data from these pilot-specific surveys is then processed and analyzed through an aviation-focused system or scale. Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress. Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper&#x27;s modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators&#x27; perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress. The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings. The questionnaire was able to reflect pilots&#x27; retroactive perceptions and the accuracy of these perceptions.

Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor started a 22-item questionnaire for U.S. Naval aviators in 1982 to test the hypothesis that inadequate stress coping strategies contributed to flight mishaps. The questionnaire consists of items related to lifestyle changes and personality characteristics. After completing the questionnaire, the test group is divided into two groups: &quot;at-fault&quot; with mishap, and &quot;not-at-fault&quot; in a mishap. Then, questionnaires from these two groups were analyzed to examine differences. A study of British commercial airline pilots, conducted by Sloan and Cooper (1986), surveyed 1,000 pilot members from the British Airline Pilots&#x27; Association (BALPA). They used a modified version of Alkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor&#x27;s questionnaire to collect data on pilots&#x27; perceptions of the relationship between stress and performance. Being a subjective measure, this study&#x27;s data was based on pilots&#x27; perceptions, and thus rely on how accurately they recall past experiences their relationships to stress. Despite relying on subjective perceptions and memories, the study showed that pilot reports are noteworthy.

Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is another scale used in many industries, including the mental health professions, to screen for depressive symptoms.
Parsa and Kapadia (1997) used the BDI to survey a group of 57 U.S. Air Force fighter pilots who had flown combat operations. The adaptation of the BDI to the aviation field was problematic. However, the study revealed some unexpected findings. The results indicated that 89% of the pilots reported insomnia; 86% reported irritability; 63%, dissatisfaction; 38%, guilt; and 35%, loss of libido. 50% of two squadrons and 33% of another squadron scored above 9 on the BDI, suggesting at least low levels of depression. Such measurement may be difficult to interpret accurately.

==Stress in College==
College can be a stressful time for many students, as they adjust to a new and unfamiliar environment while transitioning from adolescence to adulthood. Nearly 80% of college students report frequently dealing with daily stress. Sources of stress that influence college students’ stress levels include family and friends who are often physically further away, as well as changes in communication patterns with these individuals. Long-held beliefs (i.e. religious beliefs) as well as new opportunities for various behavior (i.e. alcohol and drug use) are also significant influential factors. In addition to these potential sources of stress, college students are also faced with often rigorous academic demands. In order to manage this stress, students rely on many strategies including problem-focused and emotion-focused coping.

Problem-focused strategies employ action-oriented behavioral activities such as planning. Emotion-focused strategies involve the expression of emotion and often include the altering of expectations. Although problem-focused strategies have often been found to be more effective than emotion-focused strategies, both categories include coping mechanisms that effectively reduce the negative impacts of stress.

There are several practical examples of problem-focused or approach-based coping strategies. Notably, developing time management skills, avoiding procrastination, and goal-setting are associated with stress reduction. These skills allow students to better prioritize new responsibilities, leaving them more time for sleep and leisure activities, which have been shown to reduce stress. Additionally, working towards or maintaining healthy sleep habits helps individuals better cope with high levels of stress.

Several emotion-focused strategies have also been found to be effective in combating stress. Accommodation strategies that do not directly change the stressor, but rather change one&#x27;s emotions surrounding the stressors, such as positive re framing, which are widely associated with stress reduction. Strategies like finding humor and journaling—especially gratitude journaling—are also effective.

Without effective coping skills, students tend to engage in unsafe behaviors as a means of trying to reduce the stress they feel.Ineffective coping strategies popular among college students include drinking excessively, drug use, excessive caffeine consumption, withdrawal from social activities, self-harm, and eating disorders. These ineffective strategies can be dangerous because they often become habitual, addictive, and sometimes fatal. For example, when college students turn to drinking as a way of coping with stress, they begin to drink larger quantities and more frequently, instead of just occasionally with friends. This can lead to alcohol poisoning, addiction, and other dangerous behaviors. The problems these coping methods create can cause more harm than good and often lead to more stress for the student.

Researchers have not found significant gender differences in regard to how men and women use problem-focused coping strategies. However, there is gender variation in regard to emotion-focused coping. Women tend to use emotion-focused coping strategies more often than men on average. However, men do report using one emotion-focused coping strategy more often than women—mental disengagement in the form of alcohol use. Mental disengagement refers to when individuals refocus their negative emotions to an alternative resource, such as alcohol, instead of addressing the original stressor. Overall, women report higher stress levels than men, specifically for social relationships, daily hassles, finances, self-imposed stress, frustration, and academics. This could be because women are often more in-tune to their emotions and are more comfortable expressing their feelings.

While stress for college students is part of the transitional experience, there are many strategies that students can use to reduce stress in their lives and manage the impacts of stress. Time management skills which encompass goal setting, scheduling, and pacing are effective approaches to reducing stress. Additionally, students should keep up their physical and mental health with regular exercise, healthy eating, good sleep habits, and mindfulness practices. There are several services, such as counseling and therapy, available to students that can be accessed both on and off campus to support stress management and overall student wellbeing. Adults in college benefit fairly equally from methods that are more directly related to stress management (such as time management and relaxation exercises) and being physically active (such as adding running or weight lifting into your regular routine).

An approach for stress relief commonly adopted by college students is engaging in gaming as a hobby. While some research suggests a negative relationship between video game usage and academic performance, several studies indicate a positive correlation between stress reduction and playing casual video games. For instance, one study demonstrated that engaging in casual video games effectively decreased psychological and physiological stress levels among students, with comparable benefits to stress-relieving meditation. When utilized with appropriate time management, video gaming can serve as a viable stress-relief strategy for college students.

<text>Erik the Viking is a 1989 British comedy-fantasy film written and directed by Terry Jones. The film was inspired by Jones&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;The Saga of Erik the Viking&quot; (1983), but the plot is completely different. Jones also appears in the film as King Arnulf.

==Plot==
Erik, a young Viking, discovers that he has no taste for rape and pillage, and suffers guilt over the death of an innocent woman, Helga.

Erik learns from the wise woman Freya that Fenrir the wolf has swallowed the sun, plunging the world into the age of Ragnarök. Erik resolves to travel to Asgard to petition the gods to end Ragnarök. Freya informs him that to do so he must seek the Horn Resounding in the land of Hy-Brasil. The first note blown upon the Horn will take Erik and his crew to Asgard, the second will awaken the gods, and the third will bring the crew home. Erik sets out with a crew of all ages and professions from his village, including Harald, a Christian missionary who does not believe the myths.

Keitel Blacksmith is persuaded by his apprentice Loki into secretly opposing Erik&#x27;s plan, and joins Erik&#x27;s crew in order to sabotage Erik&#x27;s plans. Loki sneaks out to inform Halfdan the Black, a local warlord afraid that peace will mean the end of his reign. Halfdan&#x27;s crew sets sail in pursuit of Erik.

Arriving at Hy-Brasil, Erik and crew are astonished to find it a sunlit land where the people, who dress like ancient Greeks, are exceedingly friendly and hospitable (if musically untalented). Erik promptly falls in love with Princess Aud, daughter of King Arnulf. During one of their romantic encounters, Erik hides from Arnulf using Aud&#x27;s magic cloak of invisibility.

Aud has warned the Vikings that should blood ever be shed upon Hy-Brasil, the entire island would sink beneath the waves. Erik and his crew defend Hy-Brasil against Halfdan&#x27;s ship. Loki is found aboard the ship, and pretends to have sneaked aboard to sabotage it. In gratitude for Erik&#x27;s having saved Hy-Brasil, King Arnulf presents him with the Horn Resounding, which is much larger than Erik had imagined. Loki steals the Horn&#x27;s mouthpiece in the night, without which it cannot be sounded, and persuades Keitel to throw it in the sea. Snorri, one of Erik&#x27;s men, catches them in the act and Loki kills him. A single drop of the man&#x27;s blood falls from Loki&#x27;s dagger and triggers an earthquake that causes the island to sink.

Erik&#x27;s crew prepare to escape in their ship with Aud and the Horn safely aboard. Arnulf refuses to join them, denying that the island is sinking, up to the very moment he and the other islanders are swallowed by the waves. Aud, who witnessed Snorri&#x27;s murder and was able to recover the mouthpiece, sounds the first note on the Horn. The ship is propelled over the edge of the flat Earth and into space, where it comes to rest upon the plane of Asgard. Erik sounds the second note to awaken the gods, and he and his crew climb a path made of stars to approach the great Hall of Valhalla.

Erik and the crew encounter old friends and enemies slain in battle. The gods are revealed to be petulant children who have no interest in answering mortal prayers. Harald the missionary sees neither hall, nor ghosts or gods, and passes intangibly through its walls due to his Christianity. Odin persuades Fenrir to spit out the sun, but tells Erik that the end of Ragnarök will not bring peace to the world. Odin then informs Erik that he and his crew cannot return home. Nor may they remain in Valhalla, since they were not slain in battle; instead they are to be cast into the fiery Pit of Hel. Some of the crew who died earlier in the adventure attempt to save them, but even as they are drawn into the Pit, they hear the Horn Resounding&#x27;s third note, blown by Harald, who had returned to the ship, which flings them clear.

Erik&#x27;s crew, including the formerly dead men, immediately find themselves back in their home village. They are dismayed to find that Halfdan and his soldiers have arrived before them and are holding the villagers captive. Halfdan and his men are suddenly crushed to death by Erik&#x27;s ship as it falls out of the sky, with Harald aboard. As the villagers celebrate Erik&#x27;s return and Halfdan&#x27;s defeat, the sun rises, ending the age of Ragnarök.

==Cast==
==Production==
Principal photography took place at Shepperton Studios in England. Some footage of Erik&#x27;s village and environments was shot in Norway, while the Hy-Brasil sequence was filmed in Malta. Artwork was made by Tolkien artist Alan Lee. The music score was composed by Neil Innes.

&quot;Amadeus&quot; star Tom Hulce was originally going to star as Erik, but he decided instead to pursue his stage career.

The production by the Monty Python company Prominent Features received financial backing from Swedish Svensk Filmindustri, which contributed to the film having its premiere in Sweden on 1 September 1989, followed by the US on 22 September, and the UK on 29 September. On cinema it had a running time of 107 minutes, but unhappy with the film&#x27;s slow pacing, Jones cut it down to 89 minutes for the VHS release the following year.

In 2006 Jones was given the opportunity of re-editing the film for its DVD release. He delegated the actual editing work to his son Bill, who produced a 75-minute &quot;Director&#x27;s Son&#x27;s Cut&quot;, with re-ordered scenes and much tighter pacing as well as a completely remixed and re-dubbed soundtrack.

===Media adaptations===
Graham Thompson adapted the film into a 1989 comic book.

A video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System was in development by Eurocom and was to be published by Video System and Kemco but was cancelled before release.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 50% based on reviews from 20 critics.

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine gave the film a positive review: &quot;The idea of telling the story of a Viking warrior who thought there must be more to life than rape and pillage is an amusing one&quot;, and concluded that it was &quot;an enjoyable film&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it 3 out of 5 and wrote: &quot;Doesn&#x27;t measure up to the best of the Python films, but it consistently entertains through the occasional gags that do not work and dialogue that is sometimes obscured by sound effects.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 0 out of a possible 4 stars, calling it &quot;An utterly worthless exercise in waste and wretched excess, uninformed by the slightest spark of humor, wit or coherence.&quot;
Chris Willman of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave it a negative review, and called it &quot;A stillborn comedy in which minutes sometimes mysteriously go by between even attempted gags, and in which virtually no comic scene works up to any kind of viable punch line or payoff.&quot;

===Box office===
It made £845,436 in the UK.

<doc id="255485" wikidata="Q1353836" url="?curid=255485" title="Hrothgar">
<text>Hrothgar ( ; ) was a semi-legendary Danish king living around the early sixth century AD. Many years later, Hrothgar paid money to the Wulfings to resolve a blood feud they had with Ecgtheow, Beowulf&#x27;s father.

Hrothgar appears in the Anglo-Saxon epics &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot;, in Norse sagas and poems, and in medieval Danish chronicles. In both Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian tradition, Hrothgar is a Scylding, the son of Halfdan, the brother of Halga, and the uncle of Hrólfr Kraki. Moreover, in both traditions, the mentioned characters were the contemporaries of the Swedish king Eadgils; and both traditions also mention a feud with men named Fróði and Ingeld. The consensus view is that Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian traditions describe the same person.

==Names==
Hrothgar, also rendered &quot;Hrōðgār&quot;, is an Old English form attested in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot;, the earliest sources to mention the character. In non-English sources, the name appears in more or less corresponding Old Icelandic, Old Danish, and Latinized versions. He appears as &quot;Hróarr&quot;, &quot;Hroar&quot;, etc., in sagas and poetry, and as &quot;Ro&quot; or &quot;Roe&quot; in the Danish Latin chronicles. The form &quot;Hrōðgār&quot; is thought to have derived from the proto-Norse *&quot;Hrōþigaizaz&quot; &quot;famous spear&quot;, i.e. &quot;Roger&quot;. The corresponding Old Norse name &quot;Hróarr&quot; and its variations are derived from *&quot;Hrōþigaizaz&quot;, and from the very close names *&quot;Hrōþiwarjaz&quot; &quot;famous defender&quot; or *&quot;Hrōþiharjaz&quot; &quot;famous warrior&quot;.

==Anglo-Saxon poems==
Hrothgar appears in two Anglo-Saxon poems, &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot;. &quot;Beowulf&quot; gives the fuller account of Hrothgar and how the Geatish hero Beowulf visited him to free his people from the trollish creature Grendel. &quot;Widsith&quot; only mentions Hrothgar, Heorot, his nephew Hroðulf and their enemy Ingeld, but can complete &quot;Beowulf&quot; in some cases where &quot;Beowulf&quot; does not give enough information. This is notably the case concerning the ending of his feud with Ingeld.

===&quot;Beowulf&quot;===

In the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Hrothgar is mentioned as the builder of the great hall Heorot and ruler of Denmark, when the Geatish hero Beowulf arrives to defeat the monster Grendel.

When Hrothgar is introduced in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, it is explained that he was the second of four children of King Healfdene: he had an older brother, Heorogar, who was king before him; a younger brother Halga; and a sister, who was married to the king of Sweden. The sister is not named in the manuscript and most scholars agree this is a scribal error, but suggested names are Signy and Yrsa. Friderich Kluge (1896) accordingly suggested that the line be restored as &quot;hyrde ic þ [Sigeneow wæs Sæw]elan cwen&quot;, rendering the Norse names in Old English forms. However, the only certain Swedish (Scylfing) royal name ending in -ela that has come down to us is Onela, and according to the rules of alliteration, this means that the queen&#x27;s name must have begun with a vowel. Sophus Bugge consequently identified her with the Swedish queen Yrsa. He thus suggested the line should be emended to read &quot;hyrde ic þ[æt Ȳrse wæs On]elan cwen&quot;. Most 20th-century translators followed this suggestion. However, in Norse tradition, Yrsa was the daughter and lover/rape victim of Hrothgar&#x27;s younger brother Halga, and the mother of Halga&#x27;s son Hroðulf, and most modern translators simply leave the line as it is.

The poem further tells that Hrothgar was &quot;slain in war&quot; and so his kinsmen eagerly followed him. He is both honest and generous: &quot;He broke no oaths, dealt out rings, treasures at his table&quot;. When Beowulf leads his men to Denmark, he speaks of Hrothgar to both a coast-guard and to Hrothgar&#x27;s herald: he calls Hrothgar a &quot;famed king&quot;, &quot;famed warrior&quot;, and &quot;protector of the Scyldings&quot; (the ruling clan), and describes him as &quot;old and good.&quot; The poet emphasizes that the Danes &quot;did not find fault&quot; with Hrothgar, &quot;for that was a good King&quot;. When Beowulf defeats Grendel, Hrothgar rewards Beowulf and his men with great treasures, showing his gratitude and open-handedness. The poet says that Hrothgar is so generous that &quot;no man could fault him, who wished to speak the truth.&quot;

Hrothgar was married to a woman named Wealhþeow, who was a Helming, probably defining her as a relative of Helm, the ruler of the Wulfings. When Hrothgar welcomes Beowulf, he recalls his friendship with Beowulf&#x27;s family. He met Beowulf&#x27;s father Ecgþeow &quot;when I first ruled the Danes&quot; after the death of Heorogar; he laments Heorogar&#x27;s fall (&quot;He was better than I!&quot;) and recalls how he settled Ecgþeow&#x27;s blood feud with the Wulfings. Hrothgar thanks God for Beowulf&#x27;s arrival and victory over Grendel, and swears to love Beowulf like a son.

The poem introduces Hroðulf (Hrólfr Kraki in Scandinavian sources) as Hrothgar&#x27;s supporter and right-hand man; and we learn that Hroðulf is Hrothgar&#x27;s nephew and that &quot;each was true to the other&quot;. The common piece of information that Hrothgar&#x27;s younger brother Halga is Hroðulf&#x27;s father comes from Scandinavian sources (see below), where Halga was unaware that Yrsa was his own daughter and either raped or seduced her. Yrsa herself was tragically also the result of Halga raping a woman.

Wealhþeow has borne Hrothgar two sons, Hreðric and Hroðmund, and Hroðulf is to be regent if Hrothgar dies before his sons are grown. (Since Hrothgar is an old man at this time—he tells Beowulf he has been king for &quot;fifty winters&quot;—and Wealhþeow&#x27;s two sons are not yet grown, it seems likely that Wealhþeow is much younger than Hrothgar, and may not be his first wife.)

Hrothgar is plunged into gloom and near-despair after Grendel&#x27;s mother attacks the hall and kills Hrothgar&#x27;s best friend and closest advisor; but when Beowulf advises him not to despair, and that &quot;it is better to avenge our friends than to mourn overmuch&quot;, Hrothgar leaps to his feet and thanks God for Beowulf&#x27;s wise words, and leads the Danes and Geats out to attack the small lake (mere) where Grendel&#x27;s mother lives.

After Beowulf defeats Grendel&#x27;s mother, Hrothgar rewards him again, and then preaches a sermon in which he warns Beowulf to beware of arrogance and forgetfulness of God.

Beowulf takes his leave of Hrothgar to return home, and Hrothgar embraces him and weeps that they will not meet again (because Hroðgar is a very old man). This is Hrothgar&#x27;s last appearance in the poem. When Beowulf reports on his adventure to his lord Hygelac, he mentions that Hrothgar also had a daughter, Freawaru; it is not clear whether Freawaru was also the daughter of Wealhþeow or was born of an earlier marriage. Since the Danes were in conflict with the Heaðobards, whose king Froda had been killed in a war with the Danes, Hrothgar sent Freawaru to marry Froda&#x27;s son Ingeld, in an unsuccessful attempt to end the feud.

Beowulf predicts to Hygelac that Ingeld will turn against his father-in-law Hrothgar. Earlier in the poem, the poet tells us that the hall Heorot was eventually destroyed by fire:


It is tempting to interpret the new war with Ingeld as leading to the burning of the hall of Heorot, but the poem separates the two events (by a &quot;ne wæs hit lenge þā&quot; meaning &quot;nor far way was that day when&quot;, in Gummere&#x27;s translation). According to &quot;Widsith&quot; (see below), Hrothgar and Hroðulf defeat Ingeld, and if Scandinavian tradition (see the more detailed discussion below) is to be trusted Hrothgar himself is killed by a relative, or by the king of Sweden, but he is avenged by his younger brother Halga. Halga dies in a Viking expedition; Hroðulf succeeds him and rises in fame, and according to Hroðulf&#x27;s own saga and other sources, Hroðulf&#x27;s cousin and/or brother-in-law Heoroweard slays Hroðulf (is this the event referred to as the burning of Heorot?). Heoroweard himself dies in that battle, and according to two sources, this happens only a few hours later, as an act of vengeance by a man loyal to Hroðulf, called Wigg. This is the kin-slaying end of the Scylding dynasty.

===&quot;Widsith&quot;===
Whereas &quot;Beowulf&quot; never dwells on the outcome of the battle with Ingeld, the possibly older poem &quot;Widsith&quot; refers to Hrothgar and Hroðulf defeating Ingeld at Heorot:

This piece suggests that the conflict between the Scyldings Hrothgar and Hroðulf on one side, and the Heaðobards Froda and Ingeld on the other, was well known in Anglo-Saxon England. This conflict also appears in Scandinavian sources, but in the Norse tradition the Heaðobards had apparently been forgotten and the conflict is instead rendered as a family feud (see &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; and &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, below, for more information). The Norse sources also deal with the defeat of Ingeld and/or Froda.

==Scandinavian sources==
In the Scandinavian sources, consisting of Norse sagas, Icelandic poems and Danish chronicles, Hrothgar also appears as a Danish king of the Scylding dynasty. He remains the son of Healfdene and the elder brother of Halga. Moreover, he is still the uncle of Hroðulf. The Scandinavian sources also agree with &quot;Beowulf&quot; by making Hrothgar contemporary with the Swedish king Eadgils. These agreements with &quot;Beowulf&quot; are remarkable considering that these sources were composed from oral tradition 700 to 800 years after the events described, and 300 to 400 years later than &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Widsith&quot;.

There are also notable differences. The Heaðobards Ingeld and Froda also appear in Scandinavian tradition, but their tribe, the Heaðobards, had long been forgotten, and instead the tribal feud was rendered as a family feud. Their relationship as father and son had also been reversed in some sources, and so either Ingeld or Froda is given as the brother of Healfdene. Ingeld or Froda murdered Healfdene, but was himself killed in revenge by Hrothgar and Halga. Moreover, in Scandinavian tradition, Hrothgar is a minor character in comparison to his nephew Hroðulf. Such differences indicate that &quot;Beowulf&quot; and Scandinavian sources represent separate traditions.

The names of Hrothgar and others appear in the form they had in Old Icelandic or Latinized Old Danish at the time the stories were put to paper, and not in their Old English or more &quot;authentic&quot; Proto-Norse forms.

It has been a matter of some debate whether the hero Beowulf could have the same origin as Hroðulf&#x27;s berserker Bödvar Bjarki, who appears in Scandinavian sources.

Among these sources, it is the most famous one, the &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, which is most different from &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and a notable difference is that Hrothgar leaves the rule of Denmark to his younger brother Halga and moves to Northumbria. The focus is consequently on the &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; when a scholar questions the comparison of Hrothgar and other characters from &quot;Beowulf&quot; with counterparts in Scandinavian tradition. Scandinavian sources have added some information that appear in &quot;Beowulf&quot; studies, without having any founding in the work itself, such as the information that Halga was, or probably was, Hroðulf&#x27;s father. Another example is the existence of a woman named Yrsa, who, however, has been transposed to a role she never had in any source texts, that of Hrothgar&#x27;s sister.

===Norse sagas and poems===
In Icelandic sources, Hrothgar, Halga and Hroðulf appear under the Old Icelandic forms of their names; that is, as &quot;Hróarr&quot;, &quot;Helgi&quot; and &quot;Hrólfr&quot;, the last one with the epithet &quot;Kraki&quot;. In the case of the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; (&quot;Saga of the Scyldings&quot;) only a Latin summary has survived, and so their names are Latinized. The Icelandic sources can be divided into two groups: the &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; on the one hand, and the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot; on the other. Both groups tell a version of Hrothgar and Halga&#x27;s feud with Froda (Fróði) and Ingeld (Ingjaldr). However, whereas the &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; make Froda the brother of Healfdene, the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot; make Ingeld the brother of Healfdene. &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; also disagrees with all the other works by moving Hrothgar from the throne of Denmark to Northumbria.

====&quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;====
&quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; relates that Halfdan has three children, Hróarr, Helgi, and the daughter Signý, who is married to Sævil Jarl. Halfdan has a brother named Fróði and both of them rule a kingdom, but Halfdan is good-natured and friendly, whereas Fróði is savage. Fróði attacks and kills Halfdan and makes himself the king of a united Denmark. He then sets out to neutralize his nephews Hróarr and Helgi. However, the two brothers survive on an island, protected by a man called Vivil; and after some adventure they avenge their father by killing Fróði.

Hróarr is presented as &quot;meek and blithe&quot;, and he is completely removed from ruling the kingdom, leaving the rule to his brother Helgi. Instead he joins Norðri, the king of Northumberland, where he marries Ögn, the king&#x27;s daughter. As recompense for Hróarr&#x27;s share of the Danish kingdom, Helgi gives him a golden ring.

Sævil Jarl&#x27;s son Hrókr (Hróarr and Helgi&#x27;s nephew) becomes jealous that he has not inherited anything from his grandfather Halfdan; he goes to his uncle Helgi to claim his inheritance. Helgi refuses to give him a third of Denmark, and so instead he goes to Northumbria to claim the golden ring. He asks Hróarr if he at least could have a look at the ring, whereupon he takes the ring and throws it into the water. Hróarr naturally becomes angry, and cuts off Hrókr&#x27;s feet and sends him back to his ships. Hrókr cannot live with this, and so he returns with a large army and slays Hróarr. Helgi avenges his brother by also cutting off Hrókr&#x27;s arms. Hróarr&#x27;s son Agnar retrieves the ring by diving in the water, which gives him great glory. Agnar is said to have become greater than his father, and much talked of in the old sagas.

Helgi attacks Sweden to retrieve Yrsa, his daughter and lover, but is killed by Aðils, the king of Sweden. He is succeeded by Hrólfr Kraki, his son by Yrsa.

Although it agrees with all the other Scandinavian sources in telling the story of Halga&#x27;s incestuous relationship with his daughter Yrsa, it disagrees with all of them and with &quot;Beowulf&quot; by removing Hrothgar altogether as the king of Denmark. Instead, his place is taken by his brother Halga, and Hrothgar is sent to Northumberland, where he marries Ögn, the daughter of a positively fictive king Norðri who is named after Northumberland (&quot;Norðimbraland&quot;). Opinion is divided on whether there is any connection between Hrothgar&#x27;s wife Wealhþeow in &quot;Beowulf&quot; and his wife Ögn in &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;; it has been suggested that Ögn shows that Wealhþeow and her family (the Helmings) were Anglo-Saxon. Another difference is that Hrothgar&#x27;s sons Hreðric and Hroðmund do not appear in the Scandinavian tradition, but correspond to Agnar, in &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;.

====&quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot;====
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot; tell a similar version to that of the &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, but with several striking differences. Ingeld (Ingjaldus) of &quot;Beowulf&quot; reappears, but it is Ingeld who is the father of Froda (Frodo), and unlike in &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, Ingeld takes Froda&#x27;s place as the half-brother of Healfdene (Haldan).

The sources relate that Haldan has a half-brother named Ingjaldus and a queen Sigrith with whom he has three children: the sons Roas and Helgo and the daughter Signy.

Ingjaldus is jealous of his half-brother Haldan and so he attacks and kills him, and then marries Sigrith. Ingjaldus and Sigrith then have two sons named Rærecus and Frodo. Their half-sister Signy stays with her mother until she is married to Sævil, the jarl of Zealand. Ingjaldus, who is worried that his nephews will want revenge, tries to find them and kill them, but Roas and Helgo survive by hiding on an island near Skåne. When they are old enough, they avenge their father by killing Ingjaldus.

The two brothers both become kings of Denmark, and Roas marries the daughter of the king of England. When Helgo&#x27;s son Rolfo (whom Helgo begat with his own daughter Yrsa) is eight years old, Helgo dies and Rolfo succeeds him. Not much later, Roas is killed by his half-brothers Rærecus and Frodo, whereupon Rolfo becomes the sole king of Denmark.

This version agrees with all other versions of the legend of Hrothgar (Roas) and Halga (Helgo) by making them sons of Healfdene (Haldan) and by presenting Hrothgar as the uncle of Hroðulf (Rolfo). It agrees with &quot;Beowulf&quot; and &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; by mentioning that they had a sister, and by dealing with their feud with Froda (Frodo) and Ingeld (Ingjaldus), although there is a role reversal by making Ingeld the father of Froda instead of the other way round. It agrees with the other Scandinavian versions by treating Halga&#x27;s incestuous relationship with his own daughter Yrsa. Moreover, it agrees with all other versions, except for &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, by presenting Hrothgar as a king of Denmark, although it agrees with &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; by marrying Hrothgar to an Anglo-Saxon woman. Another agreement with &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; is the information that their sister was married to a Sævil Jarl, and that they had to hide on an island fleeing their kin-slaying uncle, before they could kill him and avenge their father.

====&quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;====
The Old Norse genealogy work &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; tells that Hróarr had a son named Valdar, the father of Harald the Old, the father of Halfdan the Valiant, the father of Ivar Vidfamne, who was the maternal grandfather of Harald Wartooth. Harald fell at the Battle of the Brávellir against his nephew Sigurd Hring, a king of Sweden and the father of Ragnar Lodbrok.

This account is not about presenting the life of Hrothgar, but in presenting how Harald Fairhair was descended from kings and heroes in Scandinavian legend. The only reason for assuming that Hróarr is the same as Hrothgar, the Scylding, is that only Hrothgar would be a personage of old so famous so as not to need any further identification than his name. However, the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; tells that a Valdar disputed that Rörek, the cousin of Halga succeeded Hroðulf (Hrólfr Kraki) as the king of the Daner. After the war, Rörek took Zealand, while Valdar took Skåne. If based on the same tradition as &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;, Valdar had the right to claim the throne being the son of the former king Hrothgar.

===Danish medieval chronicles===
In the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (12th-century works of Danish history, written in Latin), King Hrothgar is mentioned by the Old Danish form of the name &quot;Ro&quot; or &quot;Roe&quot;. His father Healfdene appears as &quot;Haldan&quot; or &quot;Haldanus&quot;, while his brother Halga appears as &quot;Helghe&quot; or &quot;Helgo&quot;. Hroðulf appears with an epithet as &quot;Roluo Krage&quot; or &quot;Rolf Krage&quot;. Their Swedish enemy, King Eadgils, appears as &quot;Athislus&quot; or &quot;Athisl&quot; (the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; calls him &quot;Hakon&quot;.)

The only Danish work that retains traditions of the feud with Ingeld and Froda is the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

====&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;====
The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the included &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; report that Ro and Helghe were the sons of Haldan, who died of old age. The two brothers shared the rule, Ro taking the land and Helghe the water. They also tell that Ro founded and gave his name to the market town of Roskilde and that he was buried in Lejre. However, before Ro&#x27;s nephew Rolf Krage (Hroðulf), who was Helghe&#x27;s son by his own daughter Yrse, could ascend the throne, the rule of Denmark was given to a dog, on the orders of the Swedish king Hakon/Athisl (that is, Eadgils).

The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; agree with &quot;Beowulf&quot; in presenting Hrothgar (Ro) and his brother Halga (Helghe) as the sons of Healfdene (Haldan). They do not, however, contain a character description as &quot;Beowulf&quot; does; nor do they mention his spouse or his children. However, they introduce a sharing of power between Hrothgar and Halga where Halga only had power over the fleet. Hrothgar is reported as founding the town of Roskilde, which coincides with the information in &quot;Beowulf&quot; that he built Heorot. The information that Hroðulf (Rolf) was the result of an incestuous relationship between Halga and his daughter Yrse only appears in Scandinavian tradition. Like &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; makes Hrothgar the contemporary of Eadgils (Athisl), whereas the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; calls the Swedish king &quot;Hakon&quot;.
====&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;====
The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 2), by Saxo Grammaticus, contains roughly the same information as &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;: that is, that Ro was the son of Haldanus and the brother of Helgo, and the uncle of his successor Roluo Krage (Hroðulf). It is only said about Ro that he was &quot;short and spare&quot;, that he founded the town of Roskilde, and that when their father Haldanus died of old age, he shared the rule of the kingdom with his brother Helgo, Ro taking the land and Helgo the water.

Ro could not defend his kingdom against the Swedish king Hothbrodd, who was not happy with warring in the East but wished to test his strength against the Danes (Oliver Elton&#x27;s translation):

Ro was, however, avenged by his brother Helgo, who then promptly went east and died in shame (because he discovered that he had fathered Roluo Krake with his own daughter Urse.) Roluo succeeded his father and uncle to the Danish throne.

The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; also agrees with &quot;Beowulf&quot; in presenting Hrothgar (Ro) and Halga (Helgo) as brothers and the sons of Healfdene (Haldanus). Moreover, like the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;, it presents Hroðulf (Roluo) as the son of Halga and his own daughter. A striking difference is that the Swedish king Eadgils (Athisl) is pushed forward a generation, and instead, Saxo introduces Hrothgar&#x27;s killer Hothbrodd as the father of Eadgils, a place that other sources give to Ohthere. A similar piece of information is also found in the &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and the &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;, where Halga had to kill a man named Hodbrod to win all of Denmark. However, Saxo also adds the god Höðr as the brother of Eadgils in order to present a euhemerized version of the Baldr myth, later.

The tradition of the feud with the Heaðobards Ingeld and Froda appears twice in the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. The first time it tells of the feud is Book 2, where Ingeld (called &quot;Ingild&quot;) appears with the son Agnar. In this version, Ingeld&#x27;s son was about to marry Hroðulf&#x27;s sister Rute, but a fight broke out and Agnar died in a duel with Bödvar Bjarki (called &quot;Biarco&quot;).

The second time it tells of Froda and Ingeld is in Book 7, but here Hrothgar is replaced by a &quot;Harald&quot; and Halga by a &quot;Haldanus&quot;. It is the Scandinavian version of the feud, similar to the one told in the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot; and &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, where the Heaðobards are forgotten and the feud with Froda and Ingeld has become a family feud. The main plot is that Ingeld had the sons Frodo (Froda) and Harald (corresponds to Healfdene). The relationship between Ingeld and Froda was thus reversed, a reversal also found in the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and in the &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot;. Froda killed his brother and tried to get rid of his nephews Harald (corresponds to Hrothgar) and Haldanus (corresponds to Halga). After some adventures, the two brothers burnt their uncle to death inside his house and avenged their father.
==Comments==
With the exception of &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;, where he is only a name in a list, three elements are common to all of the accounts: he was the son of a Danish king Healfdene, the brother of Halga, and he was the uncle of Hroðulf. Apart from that, the Scandinavian tradition is unanimous in dwelling on the incestuous relationship between Halga and his daughter Yrsa which resulted in Hroðulf, a story which was either not presented in &quot;Beowulf&quot; or was not known to the poet. The Danish sources (&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;, &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;) all agree with &quot;Beowulf&quot; by making Hrothgar the king of Denmark. The Icelandic (&quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, &quot;Bjarkarímur&quot;, &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;) all agree with &quot;Beowulf&quot; by mentioning that they had a sister, and by mentioning their feud with Froda and Ingeld, albeit with alterations. What is unique to the Icelandic versions are the adventures of Hrothgar and Halga before one of the two brothers could become king.

The similarities between &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the mentioned Scandinavian sources are by far not the only ones. Other personalities mentioned in &quot;Beowulf&quot; appear in the stories before and after dealing with Hrothgar, but for more, see origins for Beowulf and Hrólf Kraki.

<text>Reinhold Andreas Messner (; born 17 September 1944) is an Italian climber, explorer, and author from the German-speaking province of South Tyrol. He made the first solo ascent of Mount Everest and, along with Peter Habeler, the first ascent of Everest without supplemental oxygen. He was the first person to climb all 14 eight-thousanders, doing so without supplementary oxygen. Messner was the first to cross Antarctica and Greenland with neither snowmobiles nor dog sleds and also crossed the Gobi Desert alone. He is widely considered to be the greatest mountaineer of all time.

From 1999 to 2004, Messner served as a member of the European Parliament for north-east Italy, as a member of the Federation of the Greens.

Messner has published more than 80 books about his experiences as a climber and explorer. In 2010, he received the 2nd Piolet d&#x27;Or Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2018, he received jointly with Krzysztof Wielicki the Princess of Asturias Award in the category of Sports.

==Early life and education==

Messner was born to a German-speaking family in St. Peter, Villnöß, near Brixen in South Tyrol, which is part of Italy. According to his sister, his delivery was difficult as he was a large baby and the birth took place during an air raid. His mother Maria (1913–1995) was the daughter of a shop owner and 4 years older than her husband. His father Josef (1917–1985) was drafted to serve the German army and participated in World War II on the Russian front. After the war, he was an auxiliary teacher until 1957, when he became the director of the local school. Messner was the second of nine children – Helmut (born 1943), Günther (1946–1970), Erich (born 1948), Waltraud (born 1949), Siegfried (1950–1985), Hubert (born 1953), Hansjörg (born 1955) and Werner (born 1957), and grew up in modest means.

Messner spent his early years climbing in the Alps and falling in love with the Dolomites. His father was strict and sometimes severe with him. He led Reinhold to his first summit at the age of five.

When Messner was 13, he began climbing with his brother Günther, age 11. By the time Reinhold and Günther were in their early twenties, they were among Europe&#x27;s best climbers.

Since the 1960s, Messner, inspired by Hermann Buhl, was one of the first and most enthusiastic supporters of alpine style mountaineering in the Himalayas, which consisted of climbing with very light equipment and a minimum of external help. Messner considered the usual expedition style (which he dubbed &quot;siege tactics&quot;) disrespectful toward nature and mountains.

==Career==
Before his first major Himalayan climb in 1970, Messner had made a name for himself mainly through his achievements in the Alps. Between 1960 and 1964, he led over 500 ascents, most of them in the Dolomites. In 1965, he climbed a new direttissima route on the north face of the Ortler. A year later, he climbed the Walker Spur on the Grandes Jorasses and ascended the Rocchetta Alta di Bosconero. In 1967, he made the first ascent of the northeast face of the Agnér and the first winter ascents of the Agnér north face and Furchetta north face.

In 1968, he achieved further firsts: the Heiligkreuzkofel middle pillar and the direct south face of the Marmolada. In 1969, Messner joined an Andes expedition, during which he succeeded, together with Peter Habeler, in making the first ascent of the Yerupaja east face up to the summit ridge and, a few days later, the first ascent of the Yerupaja Chico. He also made the first solo ascent of the Droites north face, the Philipp-Flamm intersection on the Civetta and the south face of Marmolada di Rocca. As a result, Messner won the reputation of being one of the best climbers in Europe.

In 1970, Messner was invited to join a major Himalayan expedition that was going to attempt the unclimbed Rupal face of Nanga Parbat. The expedition, which was the major turning point in his life, turned out to be a tragic success. Both he and his brother Günther reached the summit but Günther died two days later on the descent of the Diamir face. Reinhold lost seven toes, which had become badly frostbitten during the climb and required amputation. Reinhold was severely criticized for persisting on this climb with the less experienced Günther. The 2010 movie &quot;Nanga Parbat&quot; by Joseph Vilsmaier is based on his account of the events.

While Messner and Peter Habeler were noted for fast ascents in the Alps of the Eiger North Wall, standard route (10 hours) and Les Droites (8 hours), his 1975 Gasherbrum I first ascent of a new route took three days. This was unheard of at the time.

In the 1970s, Messner championed the cause for ascending Mount Everest without supplementary oxygen, saying that he would do it &quot;by fair means&quot; or not at all. In 1978, he reached the summit of Everest with Habeler. This was the first time anyone had been that high without supplemental oxygen and Messner and Habeler achieved what certain doctors, specialists, and mountaineers thought impossible. He repeated the feat, without Habeler, from the Tibetan side in 1980, during the monsoon season. This was Everest&#x27;s first solo summit.
In 1978, he made a solo ascent of the Diamir face of Nanga Parbat. In 1986, Messner became the first to complete all fourteen eight-thousanders (peaks over 8,000 metres above sea level).

Messner has crossed Antarctica on skis, together with fellow explorer Arved Fuchs. He has written over 80 books about his experiences, a quarter of which have been translated. He was featured in the 1984 film &quot;The Dark Glow of the Mountains&quot; by Werner Herzog. 
From 1999 to 2004, he held political office as a Member of the European Parliament for the Italian Green Party (Federazione dei Verdi). He was also among the founders of Mountain Wilderness, an international NGO dedicated to the protection of mountains worldwide.

In 2004 he completed a expedition through the Gobi Desert.
In 2006, he founded the Messner Mountain Museum.

== Expeditions ==

==Climbs==
=== Nanga Parbat ===
Reinhold Messner took a total of five expeditions to Nanga Parbat. In 1970 and 1978 he reached the summit (in 1978 solo); in 1971, 1973 and 1977, he did not. In 1971 he was primarily looking for his brother&#x27;s remains.

=== Rupal Face 1970 ===

In May and June 1970, Messner took part in the Nanga Parbat South Face expedition led by Karl Herrligkoffer, the objective of which was to climb the as yet unclimbed Rupal Face, the highest rock and ice face in the world. Messner&#x27;s brother, Günther, was also a member of the team. On the morning of 27 June, Messner was of the view that the weather would deteriorate rapidly, and set off alone from the last high-altitude camp. Surprisingly his brother climbed after him and caught up to him before the summit. By late afternoon, both had reached the summit of the mountain and had to pitch an emergency bivouac shelter without tent, sleeping bags and stoves because darkness was closing in.

The events that followed have been the subject of years of legal actions and disputes between former expedition members, and have still not been finally resolved. What is known now is that Reinhold and Günther Messner descended the Diamir Face, thereby achieving the first traverse of Nanga Parbat and second traverse of an eight-thousander after Mount Everest in 1963. Reinhold arrived in the valley six days later with severe frostbite, but survived. His brother, Günther, however died on the Diamir Face—according to Reinhold Messner on the same descent, during which they became further and further separated from each other. As a result, the time, place and exact cause of death is unknown. Messner said his brother had been swept away by an avalanche.

In June 2005, after an unusual heat wave on the mountain, the body of his brother was recovered on the Diamir Face, which seems to support Messner&#x27;s account of how Günther died.

The drama was turned into a film &quot;Nanga Parbat&quot; (2010) by Joseph Vilsmaier, based on the memories of Reinhold Messner and without participation from the other former members of the expedition. Released in January 2010 in cinemas, the film was criticised by the other members of the team for telling only one side of the story.

Because of severe frostbite, especially on his feet—seven toes were amputated—Messner was not able to climb quite as well on rock after the 1970 expedition. He therefore turned his attention to higher mountains, where there was much more ice.

=== Solo climb in 1978 ===
On 9 August 1978, after three unsuccessful expeditions, Messner reached the summit of Nanga Parbat again via the Diamir Face.

=== Manaslu ===
In 1972, Messner succeeded in climbing Manaslu on what was then the unknown south face of the mountain, of which there were not even any pictures. From the last high-altitude camp he climbed with Frank Jäger, who turned back before reaching the summit. Shortly after Messner reached the summit, the weather changed and heavy fog and snow descended. Initially Messner became lost on the way down, but later, heading into the storm, found his way back to the camp, where Horst Fankhauser and Andi Schlick were waiting for him and Jäger. Jäger did not return, although his cries were heard from the camp. Orientation had become too difficult. Fankhauser and Schlick began to search for him that evening, but lost their way and sought shelter at first in a snow cave. Messner himself was no longer in a position to help the search. The following day, only Horst Fankhauser returned. Andi Schlick had left the snow cave during the night and disappeared. Thus, the expedition had to mourn the loss of two climbers. Messner was later criticised for having allowed Jäger go back down the mountain alone.

=== Gasherbrum I ===
Together with Peter Habeler, Messner made a second ascent of Gasherbrum I on 10 August 1975, becoming the first man ever to climb more than two eight-thousanders. It was the first time a mountaineering expedition succeeded in scaling an eight-thousander using alpine style climbing. Until that point, all fourteen 8000-meter peaks had been summitted using the expedition style, though Hermann Buhl had earlier advocated &quot;West Alpine Style&quot; (similar to &quot;capsule&quot; style, with a smaller group relying on minimal fixed ropes).

Messner reached the summit again in 1984, this time together with Hans Kammerlander. This was achieved as part of a double ascent where, for the first time, two eight-thousander peaks (Gasherbrum I and II) were climbed without returning to base camp. Again, this was done in alpine style, i.e. without the pre-location of stores. Filmmaker Werner Herzog accompanied the climbers along the approach to base camp, interviewing them extensively about why they were making the climb, if they could say; they could not. Messner became emotional on camera when he recalled having to tell his mother about his brother&#x27;s death.

It took a week for the two climbers to summit both peaks and return to camp, after which Herzog interviewed them again. His documentary, &quot;The Dark Glow of the Mountains&quot;, with some footage the two climbers shot during the expedition on portable cameras, was released the following year.

=== Mount Everest ===
On 8 May 1978, Messner and Habeler reached the summit of Mount Everest, becoming the first men to climb it without using supplemental oxygen. Before this ascent, it was disputed whether this was possible at all. Messner and Habeler were members of an expedition led by Wolfgang Nairz along the southeast ridge to the summit. Also on this expedition was Reinhard Karl, the first German to reach the summit, albeit with the aid of supplemental oxygen.

Two years later, on 20 August 1980, Messner again stood atop the highest mountain in the world, without supplementary oxygen. For this solo climb, he chose the northeast ridge to the summit, where he crossed above the North Col in the North Face to the Norton Couloir and became the first man to climb through this steep gorge to the summit. Messner decided spontaneously during the ascent to use this route to bypass the exposed northeast ridge. Before this solo ascent, he had not set up a camp on the mountain.

===K2===

For 1979, Messner was planning to climb K2 on a new direct route through the South Face, which he called the &quot;Magic Line&quot;. Headed by Messner, the small expedition consisted of six climbers: Italians Alessandro Gogna, Friedl Mutschlechner and Renato Casarotto; the Austrian, Robert Schauer; and Germans Michael Dacher, journalist, Jochen Hölzgen, and doctor Ursula Grether, who was injured during the approach and had to be carried to Askole by Messner and Mutschlechner. Because of avalanche danger on the original route and time lost on the approach, they decided to climb via the Abruzzi Spur. The route was equipped with fixed ropes and high-altitude camps, but no hauling equipment (&quot;Hochträger&quot;) or bottled oxygen was used. On 12 July, Messner and Dacher reached the summit; then the weather deteriorated and attempts by other members of the party failed.

=== Shishapangma ===
During his stay in Tibet as part of his Everest solo attempt, Messner explored Shishapangma. A year later, Messner, with Friedel Mutschlechner, Oswald Oelz, and Gerd Baur, set up a base camp on the north side. On 28 May, Messner and Mutschlechner reached the summit in very bad weather; part of the climb involving ski mountaineering.

=== Kangchenjunga ===

In 1982, Messner wanted to become the first climber ever to scale three eight-thousanders in one year. He planned to climb Kangchenjunga, then Gasherbrum II and Broad Peak.

Messner chose a new variation of the route up the north face. Because there was still a lot of snow, Messner and Mutschlechner made very slow progress. In addition, the difficulty of the climb forced the two mountaineers to use fixed ropes. Finally, on 6 May, Messner and Mutschlechner stood on the summit. There, Mutschlechner suffered frostbite to his hands, and later to his feet as well. While bivouacking during the descent, the tent tore away from Mutschlechner and Messner, and Messner also fell ill. He was suffering from amoebic liver abscess, making him very weak. He made it back to base camp only with Mutschlechner&#x27;s help.

=== Gasherbrum II ===
After his ascent of Kangchenjunga, Mutschlechner flew back to Europe because his frostbite had to be treated and Messner needed rest. Thus the three mountains could not be climbed as planned. Messner was cured of his amoebic liver abscess and then travelled to Gasherbrum II, but could not use the new routes as planned. In any case, his climbing partners, Sher Khan and Nazir Sabir, would not have been strong enough. Nevertheless, all three reached the summit on 24 July in a storm. During the ascent, Messner discovered the body of a previously missing Austrian mountaineer, whom he buried two years later at the G I – G II traverse.

=== Broad Peak ===

In 1982, Messner scaled Broad Peak, his third eight-thousander. At the time, he was the only person with a permit to climb this mountain; he came across Jerzy Kukuczka and Wojciech Kurtyka, who had permits to climb K2, but used its geographic proximity to climb Broad Peak illegally. In early descriptions of the ascent, Messner omitted this encounter, but he referred to it several years later. On 2 August, Messner was reunited with Nazir Sabir and Khan again on the summit. The three mountaineers had decamped and made for Broad Peak immediately after their ascent of Gasherbrum II. The climb was carried out with a variation from the normal route at the start.

=== Cho Oyu ===
In the winter of 1982–83, Messner attempted the first winter ascent of Cho Oyu. He reached an altitude of about , when great masses of snow forced him to turn back. This expedition was his first with Hans Kammerlander. A few months later, on 5 May, he reached the summit via a partially new route together with Kammerlander and Michael Dacher.

=== Annapurna ===
In 1985, Messner topped out on Annapurna. Using a new route on the northwest face, he reached the summit with Kammerlander on 24 April. Also on the expedition were Reinhard Patscheider, Reinhard Schiestl and Swami Prem Darshano, who did not reach the summit. During Messner and Kammerlander&#x27;s ascent, the weather was bad and they had to be assisted by the other three expedition members during the descent due to heavy snowfall.

=== Dhaulagiri ===
Messner had already attempted Dhaulagiri in 1977 and 1984, unsuccessfully. In 1985 he finally summited. He climbed with Kammerlander up the normal route along the northeast ridge. After only three days of climbing they stood on the summit in a heavy storm on 15 May.

=== Makalu ===
Messner tried climbing Makalu four times. He failed in 1974 and 1981 on the South Face of the south-east ridge. In winter 1985–1986 he attempted the first winter ascent of Makalu via the normal route. Even this venture did not succeed. Not until February 2009 was Makalu successfully climbed in winter by Denis Urubko and Simone Moro.

In 1986, Messner returned and succeeded in reaching the summit using the normal route with Kammerlander and Mutschlechner. Although they had turned back twice during this expedition, they made the summit on the third attempt on 26 September. During this expedition, Messner witnessed the death of Marcel Rüedi, for whom the Makalu was his 9th eight-thousander. Rüedi was on the way back from the summit and was seen by Messner and the other climbers on the descent. Although he was making slow progress, he appeared to be safe. The tea for his reception had already been boiled when Rüedi disappeared behind a snow ridge and did not reappear. He was found dead a short time later.

=== Lhotse ===
Messner climbed his last normal route. Messner and Kammerlander had to contend with a strong wind in the summit area. To reach the summit that year and before winter broke, they took a direct helicopter flight from the Makalu base camp to the Lhotse base camp.

Thus Messner became the first person to climb all eight-thousanders. 
Since this ascent, Messner has never climbed another eight-thousander. 
In 1989, Messner led a European expedition to the South Face of the mountain. The aim was to forge a path up the as-yet-unclimbed face. Messner himself did not want to climb any more. The expedition was unsuccessful.

===The Seven Summits===
In 1985 Richard Bass first postulated and achieved the mountaineering challenge Seven Summits, climbing the highest peaks of each of the seven continents. Messner suggested another list (the &quot;Messner&quot; or &quot;Carstensz&quot; list) replacing Mount Kosciuszko with Indonesia&#x27;s Puncak Jaya, or Carstensz Pyramid (). From a mountaineering point of view the &quot;Messner&quot; list is the more challenging one. Climbing Carstensz Pyramid has the character of an expedition, whereas the ascent of Kosciuszko is an easy hike. In May 1986 Pat Morrow became the first person to complete the &quot;Messner&quot; list, followed by Messner himself when he climbed Mount Vinson in December 1986 to become the second.

==World-first records==
Messner is listed nine times in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. All of his achievements are classed as &quot;World&#x27;s Firsts&quot; (or &quot;Historical Firsts&quot;). A &quot;World&#x27;s First&quot; is the highest category of any Guinness World Record, meaning the ownership of the title never expires. As of 2021, Messner is the second highest record holder of &quot;World&#x27;s Firsts&quot; (after Icelandic oceanic rower Fiann Paul, who has 13). Messner&#x27;s world firsts are:

* First ascent of Manaslu without supplementary oxygen
* First solo summit of Everest
* First ascent of Everest and K2 without supplementary oxygen
* First ascent of the top three highest mountains without supplementary oxygen
* First 8,000-metre mountain hat-trick
* First person to climb all 8,000-metre mountains without supplementary oxygen
* First person to climb all 8,000-metre mountains
* First ascent of Everest without supplementary oxygen
* First ascent of Gasherbrum I without supplementary oxygen

== Messner Mountain Museum ==
In 2003 Messner started work on a project for a mountaineering museum. On 11 June 2006, the Messner Mountain Museum (MMM) opened, a museum that unites within one museum the stories of the growth and decline of mountains, culture in the Himalayan region and the history of South Tyrol.

The MMM consists of five or six locations:

* MMM Firmian at Sigmundskron Castle near Bozen is the centerpiece of the museum and concentrates on man&#x27;s relationship with the mountains. Surrounded by peaks from the Schlern and the Texel range, the MMM Firmian provides visitors with a series of pathways, stairways, and towers containing displays that focus on the geology of the mountains, the religious significance of mountains in the lives of people, and the history of mountaineering and alpine tourism. The so-called white tower is dedicated to the history of the village and the struggle for the independence of South Tyrol.
* MMM Juval at Juval Castle in the Burggrafenamt in Vinschgau is dedicated to the &quot;magic of the mountains&quot;, with an emphasis on mystical mountains, such as Mount Kailash or Ayers Rock and their religious significance. MMM Juval houses several art collections.
* MMM Dolomites, known as the Museum in the Clouds, is located at Monte Rite () between Pieve di Cadore and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. Housed in an old fort, this museum is dedicated to the subject of rocks, particularly in the Dolomites, with exhibits focusing on the history of the formation of the Dolomites. The summit observation platform offers a 360° panorama of the surrounding Dolomites, with views toward Monte Schiara, Monte Agnèr, Monte Civetta, Marmolada, Monte Pelmo, Tofana di Rozes, Sorapis, Antelao, Marmarole.
* MMM Ortles at Sulden on the Ortler is dedicated to the theme of ice. This underground structure is situated at and focuses on the history of mountaineering on ice and the great glaciers of the world. The museum contains the world&#x27;s largest collection of paintings of the Ortler, as well as ice-climbing gear from two centuries.
* MMM Ripa at Brunico Castle in South Tyrol is dedicated to the mountain peoples from Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, with emphasis on their cultures, religions, and tourism activities.
* MMM Corones, opened in July 2015 on the top of the Kronplatz mountain (&quot;Plan de Corones&quot; in Italian), is dedicated to traditional climbing.

== Political career ==
In 1999, Messner was elected Member of the European Parliament for the Federation of the Greens (FdV), the Italian green party, receiving more than 20,000 votes in the European election. He fully served his term until 2004, when he retired from politics.

Messner was officially a member of South Tyrolean Greens, a regionalist and ecologist political party active only in South Tyrol, which &quot;de facto&quot; acts as a regional branch of the FdV.

===Electoral history===
==Personal life==
From 1972 until 1977, Messner was married to Uschi Demeter. With his partner, Canadian photographer Nena Holguin, he has a daughter, Làyla Messner, born in 1981. On 31 July 2009, he married his long time girlfriend Sabine Stehle, a textile designer from Vienna, with whom he has three children.
They divorced in 2019. In late May 2021, Messner married Diane Schumacher, a 41-year-old Luxembourgish woman living in Munich, at the town hall in Kastelbell-Tschars near his home in South Tyrol.

<text>Janosch (, born as Horst Eckert on 11 March 1931) is a German children&#x27;s author and illustrator.

==Biography==
Janosch was born as Horst Eckert on 11 March 1931 in what was then Hindenburg (now Zabrze, Poland) in Upper Silesia to a family of mixed German and Polish origin, though he identifies his nationality as &quot;Silesian&quot;. His mother was a pious Catholic, and his father a violent alcoholic.

After World War II, the family fled to West Germany. In the area of Oldenburg, Janosch worked in a textile mill. In 1953, he went to Munich, where he studied for some terms at the Academy of Arts, but broke off his studies eventually. Afterwards, he worked as a freelance artist. In 1960, his first book for children was published with George Lentz, a friend of his, who also persuaded him to take on the penname &quot;Janosch&quot;.

By 1980, he had published over 100 books for children in nearly 30 languages. Amongst his most recognisable characters is the Tigerente that appears in &quot;Oh, wie schön ist Panama&quot; and the stories around the little tiger and the little bear. He has also published several books for adults, in which he deals with his childhood experiences of growing up with an abusive father and a God-fearing mother, constantly recurring topics being friendship, family relationships, and the quest for the meaning of life.

Between 1953 and 1980 the artist lived in Munich, and then relocated to the island of Tenerife where he resides to this day.

== Awards ==
Among others, he has received the following awards:
* 1975: Literaturpreis der Stadt München
* 1979: German Youth Literature Award
* 1984: Zilveren Griffel
* 1993: Bundesverdienstkreuz

== Works ==
In German, Janosch published until today about 150 books which in part were translated into 30 languages.

===Tigerente===

The Tigerente ( tiger duck) is a children&#x27;s book character created by Janosch. It is a little wooden toy duck on wheels, striped black on yellow, that is pulled around on a string by various characters of Janosch&#x27;s books. It never has a line of dialogue, but still has become by far the most popular figure ever created by the author. The Tigerente has since appeared on a wide range of products including posters, postcards, high school art projects, buttons, mugs, socks, umbrellas, cutlery, and nearly every item of children&#x27;s furniture imaginable. It has been the namesake and mascot of the German TV show &quot;Tigerenten Club&quot;, all without ever uttering a single line.

== Adaptations ==

The story &quot;&quot;Oh, wie schön ist Panama&quot; was adapted into a contemporary opera under the title &quot;Oh, the beautiful Panama&quot;&quot; by Lin Wang. The opera was premiered at Deutsche Oper Berlin in 2013, and was a sold-out event.

<doc id="255490" wikidata="Q694552" url="?curid=255490" title="Lymphogranuloma venereum">
<text>Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV; also known as climatic bubo, Durand–Nicolas–Favre disease, poradenitis inguinale, lymphogranuloma inguinale, and strumous bubo) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the invasive serovars L1, L2, L2a, L2b, or L3 of &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;.

LGV is primarily an infection of lymphatics and lymph nodes. &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; is the bacterium responsible for LGV. It gains entrance through breaks in the skin, or it can cross the epithelial cell layer of mucous membranes. The organism travels from the site of inoculation down the lymphatic channels to multiply within mononuclear phagocytes of the lymph nodes it passes.

In developed nations, it was considered rare before 2003. An outbreak in the Netherlands among gay men has led to an increase of LGV in Europe and the United States.

LGV was first described by Wallace in 1833 and again by Durand, Nicolas, and Favre in 1913. Since the 2004 Dutch outbreak many additional cases have been reported, leading to greater surveillance. Soon after the initial Dutch report, national and international health authorities launched warning initiatives and multiple LGV cases were identified in several more European countries (Belgium, France, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Switzerland) and the US and Canada. All cases reported in Amsterdam and France and a considerable percentage of LGV infections in the UK and Germany were caused by a newly discovered Chlamydia variant, L2b, a.k.a. the Amsterdam variant. The L2b variant could be traced back and was isolated from anal swabs of men who have sex with men (MSM) who visited the STI city clinic of San Francisco in 1981. This finding suggests that the recent LGV outbreak among MSM in industrialised countries is a slowly evolving epidemic. The L2b serovar has also been identified in Australia.

==Signs and symptoms==
The clinical manifestation of LGV depends on the site of entry of the infectious organism (the sex contact site) and the stage of disease progression. 
* Inoculation at the mucous lining of external sex organs (penis and vagina) can lead to the inguinal syndrome named after the formation of buboes or abscesses in the groin (inguinal) region where draining lymph nodes are located. These signs usually appear from 3 days to a month after exposure.
* The rectal syndrome (lymphogranuloma venereum proctitis, or LGVP) arises if the infection takes place via the rectal mucosa (through anal sex) and is mainly characterized by proctocolitis or proctitis symptoms.
* The pharyngeal syndrome is rare. It starts after infection of pharyngeal tissue, and buboes in the neck region can occur.

===Primary stage===

LGV may begin as a self-limited painless genital ulcer that occurs at the contact site 3–12 days after infection. Women rarely notice a primary infection because the initial ulceration where the organism penetrates the mucosal layer is often located out of sight, in the vaginal wall. In men fewer than one-third of those infected notice the first signs of LGV. This primary stage heals in a few days. Erythema nodosum occurs in 10% of cases.

===Secondary stage===
The secondary stage most often occurs 10–30 days later, but can present up to six months later. The infection spreads to the lymph nodes through lymphatic drainage pathways. The most frequent presenting clinical manifestation of LGV among males whose primary exposure was genital is unilateral (in two-thirds of cases) lymphadenitis and lymphangitis, often with tender inguinal and/or femoral lymphadenopathy because of the drainage pathway for their likely infected areas. Lymphangitis of the dorsal penis may also occur and resembles a string or cord. If the route was anal sex, the infected person may experience lymphadenitis and lymphangitis noted above. They may instead develop proctitis, inflammation limited to the rectum (the distal 10–12 cm) that may be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, and rectal discharge, or proctocolitis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12 cm above the anus and associated with symptoms of proctitis plus diarrhea or abdominal cramps.

In addition, symptoms may include inflammatory involvement of the perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or salpingitis may occur as well as lymphangitis and lymphadenitis in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20–30% develop inguinal lymphadenopathy. Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise. Diagnosis is more difficult in women and men who have sex with men (MSM) who may not have the inguinal symptoms.

Over the course of the disease, lymph nodes enlarge, as may occur in any infection of the same areas as well. Enlarged nodes are called buboes. Buboes are commonly painful. Nodes commonly become inflamed, thinning and fixation of the overlying skin. These changes may progress to necrosis, fluctuant and suppurative lymph nodes, abscesses, fistulas, strictures, and sinus tracts. During the infection and when it subsides and healing takes place, fibrosis may occur. This can result in varying degrees of lymphatic obstruction, chronic edema, and strictures. These late stages characterised by fibrosis and edema are also known as the third stage of LGV, and are mainly permanent.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis usually is made serologically (through complement fixation) and by exclusion of other causes of inguinal lymphadenopathy or genital ulcers. Serologic testing has a sensitivity of 80% after two weeks. Serologic testing may not be specific for serotype (has some cross reactivity with other chlamydia species) and can suggest LGV from other forms because of their difference in dilution, 1:64 more likely to be LGV and lower than 1:16 is likely to be other chlamydia forms (emedicine).

For identification of serotypes, culture is often used. Culture is difficult. Requiring a special medium, cycloheximide-treated McCoy or HeLa cells, and yields are still only 30–50%. DFA, or direct fluorescent antibody test, PCR of likely infected areas and pus, are also sometimes used. DFA test for the L-type serovar of &quot;C. trachomatis&quot; is the most sensitive and specific test, but is not readily available.

If polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on infected material are positive, subsequent restriction endonuclease pattern analysis of the amplified outer membrane protein A gene can be done to determine the genotype.

A fast realtime PCR (TaqMan analysis) has been developed to diagnose LGV. With this method an accurate diagnosis is feasible within a day. It has been noted that one type of testing may not be thorough enough.

==Treatment==
Treatment involves antibiotics and may involve drainage of the buboes or abscesses by needle aspiration or incision. Further supportive measure may need to be taken: dilatation of the rectal stricture, repair of rectovaginal fistulae, or colostomy for rectal obstruction.

Common antibiotic treatments include tetracycline (doxycycline) (all tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are contraindicated during pregnancy and in children due to effects on bone development and tooth discoloration), and erythromycin. Azithromycin is also a drug of choice in LGV.

===Further recommendations===
As with all STIs, sex partners of patients who have LGV should be examined and tested for urethral or cervical chlamydial infection. After a positive culture for chlamydia, clinical suspicion should be confirmed with testing to distinguish serotype. Antibiotic treatment should be started if they had sexual contact with the patient during the 30 days preceding onset of symptoms in the patient. Patients with a sexually transmitted infection should be tested for other STIs due to high rates of comorbid infections. Antibiotics are not without risks and prophylactic broad antibiotic coverage is not recommended.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is highly variable. Spontaneous remission is common. Complete cure can be obtained with proper antibiotic treatments to kill the causative bacteria, such as tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin. Prognosis is more favorable with early treatment. Bacterial superinfections may complicate course. Death can occur from bowel obstruction or perforation, and follicular conjunctivitis due to autoinoculation of infectious discharge can occur.

===Long-term complications===

Genital elephantiasis or esthiomene, which is the dramatic end-result of lymphatic obstruction, which may occur because of the strictures themselves, or fistulas. This is usually seen in females, may ulcerate and often occurs 1 to 20 years after primary infection.
Fistulas of, but not limited to, the penis, urethra, vagina, uterus, or rectum. Also, surrounding edema often occurs. Rectal or other strictures and scarring. Systemic spread may occur, possible results are arthritis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, or perihepatitis.

<text>Gérard Bessette (25 February 1920 – 21 February 2005) was a Canadian writer and educator.

Bessette was born in Sainte-Anne-de-Sabrevois, Quebec, and grew up in Montreal. He attended the Collège Saint-Ignace. He continued his studies at the Université de Montréal, where in 1950 he completed his doctorate entitled &quot;Images in French-Canadian poetry&quot;.

Unable to obtain an academic position in Quebec because of his atheism, he taught at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh from 1951 to 1957. He then found a job in Kingston, Ontario, first at Royal Military College of Canada in 1958, and then in the Department of French Studies at Queen&#x27;s University from 1959 to 1979. Bessette&#x27;s novels &quot;L&#x27;incubation&quot; (1965) and &quot;Le cycle&quot; (1971) won the Governor General&#x27;s Literary Award for Fiction (French). In 1980 he was awarded the Prix Athanase-David, Quebec&#x27;s highest literary honour.

Several of Bessette&#x27;s works address issues that led to and were representative of the Révolution tranquille, a series of societal shifts that took place in Quebec during the 1960s, which saw increased secularization and a general movement away from the influence of the Catholic Church. His earlier works are written in a realistic style, while his later novels utilize elements of the nouveau roman literary movement and tend to be more experimental. His literary criticism is noted for its Freudian readings of Québécois literature.

One of his most noted works is &quot;Le libraire&quot; (1960), an existential tale of a book store employee in a small Quebec town in the 1950s. The book deals with one of Bessette&#x27;s most common themes: the stifling culture of Quebec of that time. His work was also part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

He died on Kingston, Ontario, on 21 February 2005.

<text>Isidor Arthur Gunsberg (also spelled &quot;Günzberg&quot;, ; 1 November 1854 – 2 May 1930) was a Hungarian chess player, best known for narrowly losing the 1891 World Chess Championship match to Wilhelm Steinitz.

==Biography==
Gunsberg began his career as the player operating the remote-controlled chess automaton Mephisto, but later became a chess professional. He moved to Great Britain in 1876, later becoming a naturalized British citizen on 12 May 1908.

In the late 1880s and early 1890s Gunsberg was one of the top players in the world. He decisively won a national tournament in London in July 1885, and a few weeks later won the 4th German Chess Congress in Hamburg. In match play, he defeated Joseph Blackburne and Henry Bird in 1886. In 1887, he shared first with Amos Burn in the London tournament. In 1890 he drew a match with Mikhail Chigorin, a former and future challenger for the world chess championship. Later that year, Gunsberg himself challenged Wilhelm Steinitz for the world title. The match took place in New York City and Gunsberg lost with four wins, six losses, and nine draws.

In 1916 he sued the &quot;Evening News&quot; for libel when they said that his chess column contained &quot;blunders&quot;. He won the suit after the High Court accepted a submission that in chess matters, eight oversights did not make a &quot;blunder&quot;.

==Chess strength==
Arpad Elo calculates that Gunsberg&#x27;s best 5-year average Elo rating was 2560. According to Chessmetrics, Gunsberg&#x27;s best single performance was his 1887 match against Blackburne, where he scored 8 of 13 possible points (62%). Also, Gunsberg&#x27;s performance in the world championship match against Steinitz indicated he was a part of the world elite in the late 1880s and early 1890s. However, in the year he qualified for the match against Steinitz, 1889, Gunsberg played in three different international tournaments: Amsterdam, the German Chess Congress, and the US Chess Congress. At Amsterdam, he finished in 5th place out of 9 competitors with an exact 50% score, 4/8, behind Burn, a young Emanuel Lasker, Mason, and Van Vliet. At the German Chess Congress, he finished tied for 4th–7th places out of 18 competitors, with a +3 score, 10/17, behind Tarrasch, Burn, and Mieses. Finally, at the US Chess Congress, his best result, and the reason he was allowed to challenge Steinitz, he finished in lone 3rd place out of 20 competitors, with a +19 score, 28½/38, behind Weiss and Chigorin.

Later on, Gunsberg&#x27;s position among the foremost chess masters would slip. In the famous Hastings 1895 chess tournament, Gunsberg finished with a −3 score of 9/21, good for a share of 15th–16th place out of 22 competitors.
