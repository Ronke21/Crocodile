<text>An artificial heart is a device that replaces the heart. Artificial hearts are typically used as a bridge to heart transplantation, but ongoing research aims to develop a device that could permanently replace the heart when a transplant—whether from a deceased human or, experimentally, from a genetically engineered pig—is unavailable or not viable. , there are two commercially available full artificial heart devices; both are intended for temporary use (less than a year) for patients with total heart failure who are awaiting a human heart transplant.

Although other similar inventions preceded it from the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7 in 1982, designed by a team including Willem Johan Kolff, William DeVries and Robert Jarvik.

An artificial heart is distinct from a ventricular assist device (VAD; for either one or both of the ventricles, the heart&#x27;s lower chambers), which can be a permanent solution also, or the intra-aortic balloon pump – both devices are designed to support a failing heart. It is also distinct from a cardiopulmonary bypass machine, which is an external device used to provide the functions of both the heart and lungs, used only for a few hours at a time, most commonly during cardiac surgery. It is also distinct from a ventilator, used to support failing lungs, or the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is used to support those with both inadequate heart and lung function for up to days or weeks, unlike the bypass machine.

==History==
===Origins===
A synthetic replacement for a heart remains a long-sought &quot;holy grail&quot; of modern medicine. The obvious benefit of a functional artificial heart would be to lower the need for heart transplants because the demand for organs always greatly exceeds supply.

Although the heart is conceptually a pump, it embodies subtleties that defy straightforward emulation with synthetic materials and power supplies. Artificial hearts have historically had issues from both a biomedical standpoint, regarding clotting and foreign object rejection, as well as longevity and practicality, regarding the lifespan of the device as well as the equipment required to run it.

Since the inception of the device, artificial hearts have been continually improved as medical technology has. More recent devices, such as the Carmat heart, have sought to improve upon their predecessors by reducing complications resultant from device implant, such as foreign-body rejection and thrombus.

===Early development===
The first artificial heart was made by the Soviet scientist Vladimir Demikhov in 1938. It was implanted in a dog.

On 2 July 1952, 41-year-old Henry Opitek, suffering from shortness of breath, made medical history at Harper University Hospital at Wayne State University in Michigan. The Dodrill-GMR heart machine, considered to be the first operational mechanical heart, was successfully used while performing heart surgery.
Ongoing research was done on calves at Hershey Medical Center, Animal Research Facility, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, during the 1970s.

Forest Dewey Dodrill, working closely with Matthew Dudley, used the machine in 1952 to bypass Henry Opitek&#x27;s left ventricle for 50 minutes while he opened the patient&#x27;s left atrium and worked to repair the mitral valve. In Dodrill&#x27;s post-operative report, he notes, &quot;To our knowledge, this is the first instance of survival of a patient when a mechanical heart mechanism was used to take over the complete body function of maintaining the blood supply of the body while the heart was open and operated on.&quot;

A heart–lung machine was first used in 1953 during a successful open heart surgery. John Heysham Gibbon, the inventor of the machine, performed the operation and developed the heart–lung substitute himself.

Following these advances, scientific interest for the development of a solution for heart disease developed in numerous research groups worldwide.

===Early designs of total artificial hearts===
In 1949, a precursor to the modern artificial heart pump was built by doctors William Sewell and William Glenn of the Yale School of Medicine using an Erector Set, assorted odds and ends, and dime-store toys. The external pump successfully bypassed the heart of a dog for more than an hour.

On 12 December 1957, Willem Johan Kolff, the world&#x27;s most prolific inventor of artificial organs, implanted an artificial heart into a dog at Cleveland Clinic. The dog lived for 90 minutes.

In 1958, Domingo Liotta initiated the studies of TAH (Total Artificial Heart) replacement at Lyon, France, and in 1959–60 at the National University of Córdoba, Argentina. He presented his work at the meeting of the American Society for Artificial Internal Organs held in Atlantic City in March 1961. At that meeting, Liotta described the implantation of three types of orthotopic (inside the pericardial sac) TAHs in dogs, each of which used a different source of external energy: an implantable electric motor, an implantable rotating pump with an external electric motor, and a pneumatic pump.

Paul Winchell designed a model of artificial heart with the assistance of Henry Heimlich (the inventor of the Heimlich maneuver) and submitted a patent for a mechanically driven artificial heart implementing a cam driven roller mechanism to compress flexible bags containing blood, on 6 February 1961. This is contrary to the popular claim that Winchell submitted the patent in the summer of 1956, as well as contrary to the claim that Winchell &quot;invented&quot; the artificial heart. In fact, two patents existed prior to Winchell&#x27;s submission. These patents were filed 10 April 1956, and 17 April 1959, respectively. Winchell also claims that the design within his patent was used in later models of the Jarvik hearts, a claim in which Robert Jarvik, the principle designer of those hearts, denies on the basis that his pneumatically driven hearts share little in common with Winchell&#x27;s mechanically actuated patent.

In 1964, the National Institutes of Health started the Artificial Heart Program, with the goal of putting an artificial heart into a human by the end of the decade. The purpose of the program was to develop an implantable artificial heart, including the power source, to replace a failing heart.

In February 1966, Adrian Kantrowitz rose to international prominence when he performed the world&#x27;s first permanent implantation of a partial mechanical heart (left ventricular assist device) at Maimonides Medical Center.

In 1967, Kolff left Cleveland Clinic to start the Division of Artificial Organs at the University of Utah and pursue his work on the artificial heart.
# In 1973, a calf named Tony survived for 30 days on an early Kolff heart.
# In 1975, a bull named Burk survived 90 days on the artificial heart.
# In 1976, a calf named Abebe lived for 184 days on the Jarvik 5 artificial heart.
# In 1981, a calf named Alfred Lord Tennyson lived for 268 days on the Jarvik 5.

Over the years, more than 200 physicians, engineers, students and faculty developed, tested and improved Kolff&#x27;s artificial heart. To help manage his many endeavors, Kolff assigned project managers. Each project was named after its manager. Graduate student Robert Jarvik was the project manager for the artificial heart projects, for which the Jarvik line of artificial hearts get their name from. There, physician-engineer Clifford Kwan-Gett invented two components of an integrated pneumatic artificial heart system: a ventricle with hemispherical diaphragms that did not crush red blood cells (a problem with previous artificial hearts) and an external heart driver that inherently regulated blood flow without needing complex control systems. Jarvik also combined several modifications: an ovoid shape to fit inside the human chest, a more blood-compatible polyurethane developed by biomedical engineer Donald Lyman, and a fabrication method by Kwan-Gett that made the inside of the ventricles smooth and seamless to reduce dangerous stroke-causing blood clots.

===First clinical implantation of a total artificial heart===

On 4 April 1969, Domingo Liotta and Denton A. Cooley replaced a dying man&#x27;s heart with a mechanical heart inside the chest at The Texas Heart Institute in Houston as a bridge for a transplant. The man woke up and began to recover. After 64 hours, the pneumatic-powered artificial heart was removed and replaced by a donor heart. However thirty-two hours after transplantation, the man died of what was later proved to be an acute pulmonary infection, extended to both lungs, caused by fungi, most likely caused by an immunosuppressive drug complication.

The original prototype of Liotta-Cooley artificial heart used in this historic operation is prominently displayed in the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History &quot;Treasures of American History&quot; exhibit in Washington, D.C.

===First clinical applications of a permanent pneumatic total artificial heart===
The first clinical use of an artificial heart designed for permanent implantation rather than a bridge to transplant occurred in 1982 at the University of Utah.
In 1981, William DeVries submitted a request to the FDA for permission to implant the Jarvik-7 into a human being. On 1 December 1982, William DeVries implanted the Jarvik-7 artificial heart into Barney Clark, a retired dentist from Seattle who had severe congestive heart failure. Clark&#x27;s case was highly publicized and received much media attention, garnering attention from television networks, newspapers and periodicals. Clark lived for 112 days tethered to the UtahDrive pneumatic drive console, a device weighing some . During that time Clark required several re-operations, suffered seizures, experienced prolonged periods of confusion and a number of instances of bleeding and asked several times to be allowed to die. Clark, however, still believed his being part of the initial experiment was an important contribution to medicine, and maintained an overall positive outlook on his condition. Barney Clark died on 23 March 1983, of multiorgan system failure. Despite the complications, DeVries considered Clark&#x27;s case a success. 
DeVries subsequently moved his practice to Humana Hospital Audubon in Louisville, Kentucky to continue studies using the Jarvik-7. DeVries&#x27; first artificial heart patient in Louisville was Bill Schroeder. DeVries replaced Schroeder&#x27;s failing heart with a Jarvik-7 on 25 November 1984. Like Clark, Schroeder suffered from bleeding that required re-operation to resolve. In the first weeks the outlook was good and Schroeder was allowed to have a can of Coors beer and he was given a phone call by President Reagan, in which he famously asked the president for an update on a late Social Security check. However, 19 days after the operation, Schroeder suffered the first of four strokes. Despite this, his recovery continued and was allowed to live in a specially outfitted apartment near the hospital for a period of time, as well as use a newly developed battery-powered portable drive unit for the heart which allowed him to venture out of the hospital for short periods. Schroeder&#x27;s health continued to decline as three more strokes plagued his time with the artificial heart. He died on 6 August 1986, from complications from a stroke, respiratory failure and sepsis, after 620 days with the artificial heart.

Three more patients received the Jarvik-7 as a permanent heart. Murray Haydon, DeVries&#x27; third patient, received a Jarvik-7 on 17 February 1985. Haydon suffered pulmonary issues and was required to be on a mechanical ventilator for the duration of his time with the artificial heart. Haydon died of infection and kidney failure on 19 June 1986, after 488 days with his artificial heart. On 7 April 1985, Dr. Bjarne Semb of Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm Sweden implanted a Jarvik-7 in Swedish businessman Leif Stenberg. Stenberg lived 229 largely-uneventful days with the heart but suffered from a stroke and subsequently died on 21 November 1985. Jack Burcham was DeVries&#x27; fourth and final patient to receive a Jarvik-7 as a destination therapy. Burcham received his heart on 14 April 1985, but due to complications from the size of the device, bleeding and kidney failure, Burcham died just 10 days later on 25 April 1985.

In the mid-1980s, artificial hearts were powered by large pneumatic drive consoles. Moreover, two sizable catheters had to cross the body wall to carry the pneumatic pulses to the implanted heart, greatly increasing the risk of infection. To speed development of a new generation of technologies, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute opened a competition for implantable electrically powered artificial hearts. Three groups received funding: Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio; the College of Medicine of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center) in Hershey, Pennsylvania; and AbioMed, Inc. of Danvers, Massachusetts. Despite considerable progress, the Cleveland program was discontinued after the first five years.

===First clinical application of an intrathoracic pump===
On 19 July 1963, E. Stanley Crawford and Domingo Liotta implanted the first clinical Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) at The Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, in a patient who had a cardiac arrest after surgery. The patient survived for four days under mechanical support but did not recover from the complications of the cardiac arrest; finally, the pump was discontinued, and the patient died.

===First clinical application of a paracorporeal pump===
On 21 April 1966, Michael DeBakey and Liotta implanted the first clinical LVAD in a paracorporeal position (where the external pump rests at the side of the patient) at The Methodist Hospital in Houston, in a patient experiencing cardiogenic shock after heart surgery. The patient developed neurological and pulmonary complications and died after few days of LVAD mechanical support. In October 1966, DeBakey and Liotta implanted the paracorporeal Liotta-DeBakey LVAD in a new patient who recovered well and was discharged from the hospital after 10 days of mechanical support, thus constituting the first successful use of an LVAD for postcardiotomy shock.

===First VAD patient with FDA approved hospital discharge===
In 1990, Brian Williams was discharged from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), becoming the first VAD patient to be discharged with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. The patient was supported in part by bioengineers from the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s McGowan Institute.

==Total artificial hearts==
===Approved medical devices===
====SynCardia====
SynCardia Systems is a company based in Tucson, Arizona, which currently has two separate models of their artificial heart available. It is available in a 70cc and 50cc size. The 70cc model is used for biventricular heart failure in adult men, while the 50cc is for children and women. As of 2014, more than 1,250 patients have received SynCardia artificial hearts.

The device has two drive systems available for patients to use; the Companion 2 in-hospital driver, approved by the FDA in 2012, or the Freedom Driver System, approved in 2014. The Companion 2 replaced the Circulatory Support System Console, which was the original drive system for the heart. The Freedom Driver System is a compact portable driver for greater mobility and can allow some patients to return home. To power the heart, the drivers send pulsed air through the drivelines into the heart. The drivers also monitor blood flow for each ventricle.

In 1991 the rights to the Jarvik-7 were transferred to CardioWest, who resumed testing of the heart. Following good results with the TAH as a bridge to heart transplant, a trial of the CardioWest TAH was initiated in 1993 and completed in 2002. After the completion of this trial, CardioWest became SynCardia. The SynCardia total artificial heart was first approved for use in 2004 by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Though the SynCardia shares its design with the Jarvik-7, improvements have been made throughout its lifespan, reducing the occurrence of stroke and bleeding. Lifespan while being supported by the device has also drastically improved, with one patient being supported by the device for over 1,700 days.

In 2016, SynCardia filed for bankruptcy protection and was later acquired by the private equity firm Versa Capital Management. In 2021, SynCardia was acquired by Hunniwell Lake Ventures under its portfolio company, Picard Medical. In April 2023, SynCardia filed to become a publicly traded company via SPAC.

====Carmat Aeson bioprosthetic heart====

On 27 October 2008, French professor and leading heart transplant specialist Alain F. Carpentier announced a timeline that a fully implantable artificial heart would be ready for clinical trial by 2011 and for alternative transplant in 2013. It was developed and would be manufactured by his biomedical firm CARMAT SA, and venture capital firm Truffle Capital. The prototype used embedded electronic sensors and was made from chemically treated animal tissues, called &quot;biomaterials&quot;, or a &quot;pseudo-skin&quot; of biosynthetic, microporous materials.

According to a press-release by Carmat dated 20 December 2013, the first implantation of its artificial heart in a 75-year-old patient was performed on 18 December 2013, by the Georges Pompidou European Hospital team in Paris (France). The patient died 75 days after the operation.

In Carmat&#x27;s design, called the Aeson, two chambers are each divided by a membrane that holds hydraulic fluid on one side. A motorized pump moves hydraulic fluid in and out of the chambers. The pumped fluid causes the membrane to move, causing blood to pump through the heart. The blood-facing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac that surrounds a cow&#x27;s heart, to make the device more biocompatible. The Carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has sensors to detect increased pressure within the device. Cardiac information is sent to an internal control system that can adjust the flow rate in response to increased demand, such as when a patient is exercising.

The Carmat Aeson is aimed to be used in cases of terminal heart failure, instead of being used as a bridge device while the patient awaits a transplant. At 900 grams it weighs nearly three times the typical heart and is targeted primarily towards obese men. It also requires the patient to carry around an additional Li-Ion battery. The projected lifetime of the artificial heart is around 5 years (230 million beats).

In 2016, trials for the Carmat &quot;fully artificial heart&quot; were banned by the National Agency for Security and Medicine in Europe after short survival rates were confirmed. The ban was lifted in May 2017. At that time, a European report stated that Celyad&#x27;s C-Cure cell therapy for ischemic heart failure &quot;Could only help a subpopulation of Phase III study participants, and Carmat will hope that its artificial heart will be able to treat a higher proportion of heart failure patients&quot;.

The Carmat artificial heart was approved for sale in the European Union, receiving a CE marking on 22 December 2020. , the Carmat is only available in Europe as a bridge-to-transplant, for up to 180 days while awaiting a human heart transplant. In the United States it is only available in clinical trials.

=== Historical prototypes and devices ===

==== Total artificial heart pump ====
The U.S. Army artificial heart pump was a compact, air-powered unit developed by Kenneth Woodward at Harry Diamond Laboratories in the early to mid-1960s. The Army&#x27;s heart pump was partially made of plexiglass, and consisted of two valves, a chamber, and a suction flapper. The pump operated without any moving parts under the principle of fluid amplification – providing a pulsating air pressure source resembling a heartbeat.

====Jarvik Hearts====

The Jarvik line of hearts was developed by the now-defunct medical device company Symbion, by medical device researchers Willem Kolff and Robert Jarvik in conjunction with the University of Utah. These hearts were developed through animal trials and culminated in the Jarvik-7 100, the original model that was used in the first clinical trials of the heart. Jarvik-7 hearts were made primarily of a biocompatible plastics and polymers. These hearts used four Medtronic-Hall valves and consisted of two &quot;ventricles&quot; which contained multi-layer low-stress diaphragms. The Jarvik-7 was powered pneumatically by two transcutaneous drivelines attached to a large compressed-air drive console, originally called the Utahdrive. The drive console contained two independent drive systems for redundancy, data recording devices and backup compressed air cylinders.

The Jarvik-7 was later developed in a smaller 70cc variant so that it would fit better in the chest cavities of more patients. Another development that came to the Jarvik-7 was the introduction of a battery-powered portable drive system the size of a briefcase that later patients took advantage of.

Contrary to popular belief and erroneous articles in several periodicals, the Jarvik-7 heart was not permanently banned for use. After a hostile takeover, Symbion&#x27;s facilities had lost FDA compliance in 1990 and required that the devices be destroyed. After the rights to the device had been transferred to then CardioWest Technologies, an investigational study was approved in 1993. CardioWest Technologies became SynCardia in 2003 who currently produces the modern version of the Jarvik-7, known as the SynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart.

====POLVAD====
Since 1991, the Foundation for Cardiac Surgery Development (FRK) in Zabrze, Poland, has been working on developing an artificial heart. Nowadays, the Polish system for heart support POLCAS consists of the artificial ventricle POLVAD-MEV and the three controllers POLPDU-401, POLPDU-402 and POLPDU-501. Presented devices are designed to handle only one patient. The control units of the 401 and 402 series may be used only in hospital due to its big size, method of control and type of power supply. The control unit of 501 series is the latest product of FRK. Due to its much smaller size and weight, it is significantly more mobile solution. For this reason, it can be also used during supervised treatment conducted outside the hospital.

====Phoenix-7====
In June 1996, a 46-year-old man received a total artificial heart implantation done by Jeng Wei at Cheng-Hsin General Hospital in Taiwan. This technologically advanced pneumatic Phoenix-7 Total Artificial Heart was manufactured by Taiwanese dentist Kelvin K. Cheng, Chinese physician T. M. Kao, and colleagues at the Taiwan TAH Research Center in Tainan, Taiwan. With this experimental artificial heart, the patient&#x27;s BP was maintained at 90–100/40–50 mmHg and cardiac output at 4.2–5.8 L/min. The patient then received the world&#x27;s first successful combined heart and kidney transplantation after bridging with a total artificial heart.

====AbioMed hearts====
The first AbioCor to be surgically implanted in a patient was on 3 July 2001. The AbioCor is made of titanium and plastic with a weight of 0.9 kg (two pounds), and its internal battery can be recharged with a transduction device that sends power through the skin. The internal battery lasts for half an hour, and a wearable external battery pack lasts for four hours. The FDA announced on 5 September 2006, that the AbioCor could be implanted for humanitarian uses after the device had been tested on 15 patients. It is intended for critically ill patients who cannot receive a heart transplant. Some limitations of the current AbioCor are that its size makes it suitable for less than 50% of the female population and only about 50% of the male population, and its useful life is only 1–2 years.

By combining its valved ventricles with the control technology and roller screw developed at Penn State, AbioMed designed a smaller, more stable heart, the AbioCor II. This pump, which should be implantable in most men and 50% of women with a life span of up to five years, had animal trials in 2005, and the company hoped to get FDA approval for human use in 2008. After a great deal of experimentation, AbioMed has abandoned development of total artificial hearts as of 2015. Abiomed as of 2019 only markets heart pumps, &quot;intended to help pump blood in patients who need short-term support (up to 6 days)&quot;, which are not total artificial hearts.

====Frazier-Cohn====
On 12 March 2011, an experimental artificial heart was implanted in 55-year-old Craig Lewis at The Texas Heart Institute in Houston by O. H. Frazier and William Cohn. The device was a combination of two modified HeartMate II pumps which had undergone bovine trials.

So far, only one person has benefited from Frazier and Cohn&#x27;s artificial heart. Craig Lewis had amyloidosis in 2011 and sought treatment. After obtaining permission from his family, Frazier and Cohn replaced his heart with their device. Lewis survived for another 5 weeks after the operation; he eventually died from liver and kidney failure due to his amyloidosis, after which his family asked that his artificial heart be unplugged.

===Current prototypes===
====Soft artificial heart====
On 10 July 2017, Nicholas Cohrs and colleagues presented a new concept of a soft total artificial heart in the Journal of Artificial Organs. The heart was developed in the Functionals Materials Laboratory at ETH Zurich.

The soft artificial heart (SAH) is a silicone monoblock fabricated with the help of 3D bioprinting technology. It weighs 390g, has a volume of 679 cm3, and is operated through pressurized air. The stated goal of their SAH is to &quot;develop an artificial heart that is roughly the same size as the patient&#x27;s own one and which imitates the human heart as closely as possible in form and function&quot;. The SAH fundamentally moves and works like a natural heart, but the prototype only performed for 3000 beats (about 30 to 50 minutes at an average heart rate) in a hybrid mock circulation machine before the silicone membrane (2.3 mm thick) between the Left Ventricle and the Air Expansion Chamber ruptured.

The working life of a more recent prototype, using various polymers instead of silicone, was still limited, according to reports in early 2018, with that model providing a useful life of 1 million heartbeats, roughly ten days in a human body. At the time, Cohrs and his team were experimenting with CAD software and 3D printing, striving to develop a model that would last up to 15 years, though Cohrs noted a timeline on the process was hard to predict.

====BiVACOR Artificial Heart====
Founded in 2008, the BiVACOR company has been developing a total artificial heart based on a rotary centrifugal pump. Artificial heart researchers and cardiologists O. H. Frazier and William Cohn are on the board of the BiVACOR company. The BiVACOR heart seeks to improve the artificial heart by using a magnetically levitated impeller which reduces clotting and only has a single moving part. This also reduces size and complexity, as well as only requiring a battery pack to run. The BiVACOR heart is not pulsatile like previous hearts and contains no valves, but is capable of generating &quot;beats&quot; by rapidly changing the speed of the impeller. BiVACOR has been tested as a replacement for a heart in a sheep.

On 10 November 2023, the BiVACOR heart received FDA authorization under the investigational device exemption for use in human trials. In July 2024, a successful implantation of the BiVACOR artificial heart in a 57-year-old man with end-stage heart failure was conducted as part of its first-in-human clinical study at Baylor St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center, with four more patients expected to be enrolled in the study. A few weeks later, the second person, a 34-year-old man, had a BiVACOR artificial heart implanted at Duke University Hospital as a successful bridge to a heart transplant 10 days later.

==Others==
A centrifugal pump or an axial-flow pump can be used as an artificial heart, resulting in the patient being alive without a pulse.

A centrifugal artificial heart which alternately pumps the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation, causing a pulse, has been described.

Researchers have constructed a heart out of foam. The heart is made out of flexible silicone and works with an external pump to push air and fluids through the heart. It currently cannot be implanted into humans, but offers a new concept in artificial hearts.

===Hybrid assistive devices===

Patients who have some remaining heart function but who can no longer live normally may be candidates for ventricular assist devices (VAD), which do not replace the human heart but complement it by taking up much of the function.

The first Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) system was created by Domingo Liotta at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston in 1962.

Another VAD, the Kantrowitz CardioVad, designed by Adrian Kantrowitz, boosts the native heart by taking up over 50% of its function. Additionally, the VAD can help patients on the wait list for a heart transplant. In a young person, this device could delay the need for a transplant by 10–15 years, or even allow the heart to recover, in which case the VAD can be removed. The artificial heart is powered by a battery that needs to be changed several times while still working.

The first heart assist device was approved by the FDA in 1994, and two more received approval in 1998. While the original assist devices emulated the pulsating heart, newer versions, such as the Heartmate II, developed by The Texas Heart Institute of Houston, provides continuous flow. These pumps (which may be centrifugal or axial flow) are smaller and potentially more durable and last longer than the current generation of total heart replacement pumps. Another major advantage of a VAD is that the patient keeps the natural heart, which may still function for temporary back-up support if the mechanical pump were to stop. This may provide enough support to keep the patient alive until a solution to the problem is implemented.

In August 2006, an artificial heart was implanted into a 15-year-old girl at the Stollery Children&#x27;s Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. It was intended to act as a temporary fixture until a donor heart could be found. Instead, the artificial heart (called a Berlin Heart) allowed for natural processes to occur and her heart healed on its own. After 146 days, the Berlin Heart was removed, and the girl&#x27;s heart functioned properly on its own. On 16 December 2011 the Berlin Heart gained U.S. FDA approval. The device has since been successfully implanted in several children including a 4-year-old Honduran girl at Children&#x27;s Hospital Boston.

Several continuous-flow ventricular assist devices have been approved for use in the European Union, and, as of August 2007, were undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval.

In 2012, Craig Lewis, a 55-year-old Texan, presented at the Texas Heart Institute with a severe case of cardiac amyloidosis. He was given an experimental continuous-flow artificial heart transplant which saved his life. Lewis died 5 weeks later of liver failure after slipping into a coma due to the amyloidosis.

In 2012, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine compared the Berlin Heart to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and concluded that &quot;a ventricular assist device available in several sizes for use in children as a bridge to heart transplantation [such as the Berlin Heart] was associated with a significantly higher rate of survival as compared with ECMO.&quot; The study&#x27;s primary author, Charles D. Fraser Jr., surgeon in chief at Texas Children&#x27;s Hospital, explained: &quot;With the Berlin Heart, we have a more effective therapy to offer patients earlier in the management of their heart failure. When we sit with parents, we have real data to offer so they can make an informed decision. This is a giant step forward.&quot;

Suffering from end-stage heart failure, former Vice President Dick Cheney underwent a procedure at INOVA Fairfax Hospital, in Fairfax Virginia in July 2010, to have a Heartmate II VAD implanted. In 2012, he received a heart transplant at age 71 after 20 months on a waiting list.

<text>The first &quot;Alliance&quot; of the United States Navy (which served as part of the Continental Navy) was a 36-gun sailing frigate of the American Revolutionary War.

Originally named &quot;Hancock&quot;, she was laid down in 1777 on the Merrimack River at Amesbury, Massachusetts, by the partners and cousins, William and James K. Hackett, launched on 28 April 1778, and renamed &quot;Alliance&quot; on 29 May 1778 by resolution of the Continental Congress. Her first commanding officer was Capt. Pierre Landais, a former officer of the French Navy who had come to the New World hoping to become a naval counterpart of Lafayette. The frigate&#x27;s first captain was widely accepted as such in America. Massachusetts made him an honorary citizen and the Continental Congress gave him command of &quot;Alliance&quot;, thought to be the finest warship built to that date on the western side of the Atlantic.

==1779==

The new frigate&#x27;s first assignment was to carry Lafayette back to France to petition the French Court for increased support in the American struggle for independence. Manned by a crew composed largely of British and Irish sailors, &quot;Alliance&quot; departed Boston on 14 January 1779 bound for :Brest, France. During the crossing, a plot to seize the ship, involving 38 members of the crew, was uncovered on 2 February before the mutiny could begin. The disloyal sailors were put in irons, and the remainder of the voyage, in which the frigate captured two prizes, was peaceful. The ship reached Brest safely on the 6th.

After the marquis and his suite had disembarked, Benjamin Franklin, one of the American commissioners in Paris, ordered her to remain in France despite the fact that Landais&#x27;s original instructions had called for him to load the frigate with munitions and then to sail promptly for America. Instead, Franklin assigned the frigate to a squadron to be commanded by Captain John Paul Jones.

The squadron departed Groix Roads, near Lorient, France, on 19 June to escort a convoy of merchantmen to Bordeaux and other French ports. During a storm that night, &quot;Alliance&quot; collided with Jones&#x27; flagship, , damaging the rigging of both vessels. Nevertheless, each was able to continue, and the squadron successfully completed its mission before returning to L&#x27;Orient where the two damaged warships were repaired.

The French planned an invasion of southern England that summer, and asked Jones to carry out a diversionary raid in the northern British Isles. His flotilla sortied from Groix Roads on 14 August and headed for the southwestern corner of Ireland to begin a clockwise circumnavigation of the British Isles.

Not many days passed before Landais – who in Jones&#x27; opinion had been the real culprit in the collision two months before – began to show his disinclination toward obeying orders. On the 23rd, he was enraged when the commodore refused to allow him to chase a ship into shallow and unknown waters &quot;... when there was not sufficient wind to govern a ship.&quot; The next day, Jones later reported, &quot;Alliance&#x27;s&quot; unruly captain came on board the flagship and addressed the commodore &quot;... in the most gross and insulting terms.&quot; From that point on, Landais seemed to ignore orders entirely and operated &quot;Alliance&quot; according to his own whims.

Thus, the only really American warship in Jones&#x27; squadron belied her name by refusing to cooperate with the French vessels. She left her consorts during a squall on the night of 26 and 27 August and did not rejoin the squadron until 1 September. &quot;Betsy&quot;, a letter-of-marque ship she had just taken then accompanied the frigate. About this time, &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; captured a similar ship named &quot;Union&quot; off Cape Wrath at the northwestern corner of Scotland, and Jones allowed Landais to man both vessels. The latter again showed his complete contempt for the commodore by sending the captured ships (which would become known as the Bergen Prizes) to Bergen, Norway, where the Danish Government turned the ships over to the British consul, depriving their captors of the satisfaction of having hurt the enemy and of any hope of being rewarded for their efforts.

In the next few days, &quot;Alliance&quot; took two more small ships prompting Jones to signal Landais to board &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; for a conference. The American frigate&#x27;s commander refused to obey, but instead again sailed off on his own.

For more than two weeks thereafter, &quot;Alliance&quot; worked her way south independently along the eastern shore of Great Britain while the remainder of the squadron followed a similar course from out of sight. A bit before midnight on 22 September, a lookout in &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; reported seeing two ships. Jones hoisted recognition signals which were unanswered. Landais was continuing to ignore the flagship&#x27;s efforts to communicate. Nevertheless, at dawn, Jones was able to recognize &quot;Alliance&quot; and &quot;Pallas&quot;, a frigate of his squadron which had recently parted from the flagship with the commodore&#x27;s permission to hunt prizes.

About mid-afternoon on 23 September, the squadron, off Bridlington, sighted ships rounding Flamborough Head to the north. The oncoming vessels were part of a convoy of over 40 British merchantmen which had sailed from the Baltic Sea under the escort of the 44-gun frigate and the 22-gun hired armed ship . The convoy had been warned about the American squadron and turned back northward towards Scarborough, the two escort vessels placing themselves between the merchant ships and the approaching threat.

As the gap closed, Jones signaled his ships to form a line of battle, but Landais ignored the order and sailed off to one side, forcing &quot;Countess of Scarborough&quot; to do likewise. In the ensuing four-hour Battle of Flamborough Head off England&#x27;s Yorkshire coast, Landais, after briefly engaging the &quot;Countess&quot; took little part in the action. On the way to check up on the duel which developed between the &quot;Countess&quot; and the &quot;Pallas&quot;, Landais fired a broadside at &quot;Serapis&quot;, which was by then immobile, and lashed firmly alongside &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;- as a result both ships were damaged. Some time later, with &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; losing its duel, &quot;Alliance&quot; returned to the main battle, and Jones happily &quot;... thought the battle was at an end ...&quot; But, to his &quot;... utter astonishment&quot;, Landais&#x27; ship &quot;... discharged a broadside full into the stern of the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;.&quot; Jones and his crew &quot;... called to him [Landais] for God&#x27;s sake to forbear firing into the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;, yet he passed along off the side of the ship and continued firing.&quot; This, however, was just more collateral damage, resulting from Landais&#x27; policy of keeping well out of the line of the guns on the free side of &quot;Serapis&quot;. Unable to move his ship (either to escape or to aim a broadside at &quot;Alliance&quot;) Captain Pearson of &quot;Serapis&quot; surrendered within a short time.

Following the surrender, &quot;Alliance&quot; stood by during a desperate struggle to save the shattered, burning, leaking hulks. On the evening of the day after the battle, Jones realized that, while his flagship was doomed, her conquered opponent would probably survive. He, therefore, transferred his crew from &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; to &quot;Serapis&quot; and, the next morning, sadly watched the former sink. All this time, the squadron was simply drifting away from the British coast, but by 29 September, untiring labor had enabled &quot;Serapis&quot; to get underway, and, following French orders which were somewhat contrary to Jones&#x27;s wishes, they headed for the coast of the Netherlands. &quot;Alliance&quot; sighted land on the evening of 2 October and, the following morning, she anchored in Texel Roads, Amsterdam&#x27;s deep-water harbor, with the rest of the squadron.

When word of the battle reached London, the Admiralty ordered its nearby men-of-war to search for Jones&#x27; flotilla; the Royal Navy proceeded to look in all of the wrong places. By the time a merchantman informed London that Jones was at Texel Roads, the victorious allies and their prizes had been safe at anchor there for a week. The Royal Navy then set up a tight blockade off the Dutch port to check any seaward movement that the American squadron might attempt. Meanwhile, the British ambassador pressed the government of the Dutch Republic to return both &quot;Serapis&quot; and &quot;Countess of Scarborough&quot; to England. Failing that he demanded that Jones&#x27; squadron be expelled from Texel and thus forced to engage with the Royal Navy&#x27;s blockading squadron.

Indeed, on 12 November, the Netherlands Navy had moved a squadron of ships of the line to Texel, and its commanding officer had ordered Jones to sail with the first favorable wind. Nevertheless, the adroit commodore managed to stall his departure for over six weeks. By that time, he had managed to restore &quot;Alliance&quot; to top trim and to ready her for sea. Since the other ships in his squadron had by this time, for complex diplomatic and legalistic reasons, shifted to flying French colors Jones decided to leave them behind when he left Holland in &quot;Alliance&quot;. He had long since relieved Landais in command of that frigate, pending an official inquiry into his conduct during the cruise.

On the morning of 27 December, after foul weather had forced the British blockaders off their stations, an easterly wind sprang up and enabled &quot;Alliance&quot; to stand out to sea. She dropped the pilot an hour before noon and headed southwest along the Netherlands coast. Less than a day later the frigate transited Dover Strait and entered the English Channel. On the night of 31 December, she was off Ushant, an island off the westernmost tip of Brittany, when 1779 gave way to 1780.

==1780==

For just over a fortnight thereafter, she cruised to the south looking for British shipping; but, with the exception of one small English brig which she took, the ship encountered only friendly or neutral vessels. On 16 January 1780, Jones decided to visit Corunna, Spain, for provisions and maintenance which entailed shortening the frigate&#x27;s main yard and scraping her bottom.

On the 27th, she got underway in company with the French frigate &quot;Le Sensible&quot;. Want of winter clothing then prevented Jones from beginning an extended cruise in quest of prizes; and, instead, the ship struggled across the Bay of Biscay against head winds along a roughly northeasterly course toward L&#x27;Orient. En route, she recaptured a wine-laden French barque – a prize which had been taken by an English privateer – and saved the foundering vessel&#x27;s cargo before the barque sank. She also chanced upon &quot;Livingston&quot; and escorted that tobacco-laden American merchantman to the French coast.

&quot;Alliance&quot; anchored in Groix Roads on 10 February and moved into L&#x27;Orient harbor on the 19th. That day, Benjamin Franklin suggested that Jones take on a cargo of arms and uniform cloth for the American Army and promptly get underway for home.

Jones agreed with Franklin&#x27;s suggestion, but was kept in France for many months thereafter, attending to military, diplomatic, and social matters which he felt to be important to his country, to his crew, and to himself. Most of this time, he was away from his ship in Paris.

Meanwhile, the deposed Landais had arrived at L&#x27;Orient seeking passage to America where he hoped to be vindicated in a trial by court-martial. There, he met Arthur Lee, a disaffected fellow commissioner of Franklin, who also wanted to return home. Lee – who also hated Jones – persuaded &quot;Alliance&#x27;s&quot; former captain that neither Jones nor Franklin had had the authority to relieve him of command since Landais had held a Continental commission. Convinced that he had been wronged, Landais went on board the frigate and assumed command on 12 or 13 June.

Jones arrived at L&#x27;Orient, where he heard of this coup. He journeyed to Paris and obtained support from Franklin and Antoine de Sartine, the French Minister of Marine. When Jones returned to L&#x27;Orient on 20 June, he found that &quot;Alliance&quot; had already weighed anchor and moved to Port-Louis, Morbihan, where a recently emplaced boom blocked her path. The batteries that guarded the port, as well as three French warships, had received orders to fire on the frigate if she attempted to stand out to sea.

Surprisingly, Jones then interceded with the French authorities asking them to allow the ship to pass. He justified this action as springing from a desire to avoid wasting lives, losing the fine frigate, and straining Franco-American friendship by having French forces attack an American warship.

The hero of Flamborough may have been rationalizing to conceal less lofty motives. Samuel Eliot Morison strongly endorsed this hypothesis: &quot;The conclusion is inescapable, that Jones was not particularly eager to regain command of &quot;Alliance&quot;. He had to pretend that he was, of course, but actually he felt well rid of her, and of Landais too&quot;.

&quot;Alliance&quot; was allowed to leave France unmolested. Her homeward voyage proved to be anything but routine. Landais quarreled with his officers, abused his men, and made life miserable for his passengers. The ship had hardly lost sight of land when he locked up Capt. Matthew Parke because the commanding officer of the embarked Marine Corps contingent refused to swear unconditional obedience under all possible circumstances. Any seamen who had joined the frigate after &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; had sunk were suspected of disloyalty, many were shackled and imprisoned in the ship&#x27;s rat-infested hold. Even Arthur Lee, who had urged the Frenchman to take command, came close to being stabbed with a carving knife for taking the first slice of roast pig at dinner. In operating and navigating the ship Landais gave orders which violated the rules of safe and sensible seamanship.

The fearful and exasperated officers and passengers finally agreed that the commanding officer must be insane, and they forcibly relieved him of command on 11 August. &quot;Alliance&quot; continued on to America in a happier and more orderly fashion under the command of Lt. James A. Degge. She arrived at Boston on 19 August 1780.

The Navy Board at that port promptly gathered information on the events of the voyage and sent a hasty report to Philadelphia where the Board of Admiralty immediately ordered a thorough investigation of the whole affair. At the same time it appointed Capt. John Barry to take command of the ship and make her ready for sea with great dispatch.

Barry arrived at Boston on 19 September with orders stripping Landais of all claim to command of the frigate. By that point the recalcitrant Landais had shut himself up in the captain&#x27;s cabin and refused to leave, and he was now forcibly carried off the ship by a party of marines led by his first adversary of the voyage, Capt. Parke. Trials of Landais and Degge resulted in the ousting of both men from the service.

==1781==
Meanwhile, efforts to restore &quot;Alliance&quot; to fighting trim progressed slowly – when they moved at all – because of a dearth of both men and money. Funds for the necessary yard work and for provisioning and manning the ship were slow in reaching Boston until Col. John Laurens – a former aide-de-camp to General George Washington, a successful battlefield commander, and an exchanged prisoner of war – appeared there on 25 January 1781. Congress had appointed Laurens as its envoy extraordinary to France because his military experience seemed to fit him to become a convincing spokesman for Washington&#x27;s needy army. It had also selected &quot;Alliance&quot; as the speediest and safest ship to carry the dashing young officer to Europe. The urgency of &quot;Alliance&#x27;s&quot; new mission made the funds and crew available so that the ship was ready to sail by the end of the first week of February. A favorable wind came up on the 11th enabling her to depart Nantasket Roads and stand out to sea.

Five days later, she entered crowded ice fields and suffered &quot;considerable damage&quot; as she forced her way through. Her crew contained many British sailors, a group of whom plotted to take over the frigate and to kill all her officers but one who would be spared to navigate the vessel to an English port. However, Barry took careful precautions to prevent the mutiny from erupting.

While she sailed eastward Barry followed the orders of the Naval Committee to not pursue any shipping which would delay his progress. Yet, on 4 March, the frigate encountered a ship and a British cruiser.
. One shot brought both vessels to. The cruiser proved to be the English privateer &quot;Alert&quot; and her consort was &quot;Buono Campagnia&quot;, a prize which the Britisher had recently taken. Barry took &quot;Alert&quot; as a prize, but released the merchantman. Five days later, on 9 March, the frigate anchored in Groix Roads and disembarked her important passenger and his three companions: Thomas Paine, whose writings had exerted great influence in persuading the colonies to seek independence, Major William Jackson, a Continental Army officer from South Carolina, and the vicomte de Noailles, a cousin of Lafayette.

After almost three weeks in port, &quot;Alliance&quot; headed home on the afternoon of 29 March, escorting &quot;Marquis De Lafayette&quot;, an old, French East Indiaman which an American agent had chartered to carry a valuable cargo of arms and uniforms for the Continental Army. Before the month was out, Barry discovered and investigated a mutiny plot and punished the conspirators.

At dawn on 2 April a lookout sighted two ships to the northwest, Barry headed toward the strangers and ordered the Indiaman to follow. Undaunted, the distant vessels – which proved to be two British brigs – continued to approach the little American convoy and fired a broadside at the frigate as they passed abreast. Two answering salvoes from &quot;Alliance&quot; robbed the larger of the two English vessels of her rigging and forced her to strike her colors. Barry ordered &quot;Marquis De Lafayette&quot; to attend to the captured foe while he pursued and took the second brig. The first prize, a new and fast privateer from Guernsey named &quot;Mars&quot; though badly damaged, was repaired and sent to Philadelphia under an American crew. &quot;Marquis De Lafayette&quot; provided the prize crew for the smaller vessel, a Jersey privateer named &quot;Minerva&quot;. Barry ordered the prizemaster of this vessel to head for Philadelphia but &quot;Marquis De Lafayette&#x27;s&quot; captain had secretly ordered him to head for France if he had a chance to slip away. On the night of 17 April, foul weather separated &quot;Mars&quot; from the convoy. Nevertheless, that prize dutifully continued on toward the Delaware capes. &quot;Minerva&quot; slipped away during the next night and apparently set course for the Bay of Biscay. &quot;Marquis De Lafayette&quot; dropped out of sight during a fierce storm on the night of the 25th.

After spending two days looking for her lost charge, &quot;Alliance&quot; continued on toward America alone. On 2 May, she took two sugar-laden Jamaicamen. Off Newfoundland Banks later that day, &quot;Alliance&quot; sighted but escaped the attention of a large convoy from Jamaica and its Royal Navy escorts. Ironically, a few days before, the missing &quot;Marquis De Lafayette&quot; and her treacherous master had fallen prey to this same British force.

Almost continuous bad weather plagued Barry&#x27;s little force in the days that followed until &quot;Alliance&quot; permanently lost sight of her two prizes on 12 May. During a tempest on the 17th, lightning shattered the frigate&#x27;s main topmast and carried away her main yard while damaging her foremast and injuring almost a score of men.

Jury-rigged repairs had been completed when Barry observed two vessels approaching him from windward 10 days later but his ship was still far from her best fighting trim. The two strangers kept pace with &quot;Alliance&quot; roughly a league off her starboard beam. At first dawn, the unknown ships hoisted British colors and prepared for battle. Although all three ships were almost completely becalmed, the American drifted within hailing distance of the largest British vessel about an hour before noon; Barry learned that it was the sloop of war . Her smaller consort proved to be , also a sloop of war. The American captain then identified his own vessel and invited &quot;Atalanta&quot;″s commanding officer to surrender. A few moments later, Barry opened the inevitable battle with a broadside. The sloops immediately pulled out of field of fire of the frigate&#x27;s broadsides and took positions aft of their foe where their guns could pound her with near impunity in the motionless air, &quot;Alliance&quot; – too large to be propelled by sweeps – was powerless to maneuver.

A grapeshot hit Barry&#x27;s left shoulder, seriously wounding him, but he continued to direct the fighting until loss of blood almost robbed him of consciousness. Lieutenant Hoystead Hacker, the frigate&#x27;s executive officer, took command as Barry was carried to the cockpit for treatment. Hacker fought the ship with valor and determination until her inability to maneuver out of her relatively defenseless position prompted him to seek Barry&#x27;s permission to surrender. Indignantly, Barry refused to allow this and asked to be brought back on deck to resume command.

Inspired by Barry&#x27;s zeal, Hacker returned to the fray. Then a wind sprang up and restored &quot;Alliance&quot;″s steerage way, enabling her to bring her battery back into action. Two devastating broadsides knocked &quot;Trepassey&quot; out of the fight. Another broadside forced &quot;Atalanta&quot; to strike, ending the bloody affair. The next day, while carpenters labored to repair all three ships, Barry transferred all of his prisoners to &quot;Trepassey&quot; which – as a cartel ship – would carry them to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, to be exchanged for American prisoners. HMS &quot;Charlestown&quot; recaptured &quot;Atalanta&quot; in June and sent her into Halifax.

Temporary repairs to &quot;Atalanta&quot; ended on the last day of May, and the prize got underway for Boston. After more patching her battered hull and rigging, &quot;Alliance&quot; set out the next day and reached Boston on 6 June. While Barry recuperated, her repairs were again delayed by want of funds. Lord Cornwallis surrendered his army at Yorktown, ending the war&#x27;s last major action on land, but not the war, well before she was ready for sea. As had happened before, her restoration to service was hastened by decision to use the frigate to carry an important person to France. Lafayette – who had completed his work in America with a major role in the Yorktown campaign – arrived in Boston on 10 December 1781, wanting to return home. Even with the aid of the Marquis&#x27; great influence, a full fortnight passed before she could put to sea on Christmas Eve 1781.

==1782==
The ship arrived off L&#x27;Orient on 17 January 1782 and disembarked Lafayette and his party.

Barry wanted to make a cruise in European waters to capture British shipping which would yield crewmen to be used in freeing American prisoners by exchange. &quot;Alliance&quot; got underway in February and headed for the Bay of Biscay. Accompanying her out was the American letter-of-marque brig &quot;Antonio&quot; which was bound for home. Three days later, she chased and overhauled an American brigantine which jettisoned her guns in an effort to escape. &quot;Antonio&#x27;s&quot; commander offered to escort the unfortunate, and now defenseless, merchantman to Philadelphia and they parted from Barry the next day. &quot;Alliance&quot; encountered only friendly and neutral shipping before putting in at L&#x27;Orient on February.

Barry remained in port more than two weeks awaiting dispatches from Paris containing Franklin&#x27;s observations on the diplomatic scene and on prospects for England&#x27;s recognition of American independence and negotiations for peace. The messages arrived on 15 March, and the following day &quot;Alliance&quot; headed home.

Wretched weather and contrary winds plagued the ship for much of the voyage. The almost incessant northerly blasts forced her south into hot, unhealthful climes. Eight men died before the end of April when she managed to turn north with the trade winds and head for the Delaware River.

The frigate reached Cape Henlopen on 10 May, but found it guarded by a Royal Navy ship of the line which – in company with a tender – gave chase. Fleeing south and eluding her pursuers, &quot;Alliance&quot; turned north around Montauk Point and across Long Island Sound to New London, Connecticut, where she arrived on 13 May.

Although hopeful of soon beginning another cruise, Barry again was frustrated by the inevitable shortages of men, money, and material. Almost three months passed before &quot;Alliance&quot; was finally ready for sea. She reentered Long Island Sound on 4 August and almost immediately took &quot;Adventure&quot;, a Rhode Island brigantine which had fallen prey to an English privateer. Barry sent the prize back to New London and unsuccessfully sought her captor. On the 10th, while sailing toward Bermuda, the frigate captured the schooner &quot;Polly&quot; and sent her to Boston. On the 25th, she retook &quot;Fortune&quot;, a Connecticut sloop which the British privateer &quot;Hawk&quot; had seized on the 16th.

At the end of August, Barry headed north in quest of stragglers from a convoy which had sailed from Jamaica a bit over a month before. A week later he made a prize of &quot;Somerset&quot;, a Nantucket whaler that had been sailing under a British pass.

On 18 September &quot;Alliance&quot; captured a damaged British brig and learned that a storm had scattered the Jamaica convoy sinking or crippling both escorts and merchantmen. Making temporary repairs to this prize, Barry sent her to Boston and then began looking for the Jamaicamen. On the 24th he captured &quot;Britannia&quot; and &quot;Anna&quot;, carrying coffee, logwood, sugar, and rum. On the 27th the snow &quot;Commerce&quot; became his prize. The next day he captured the dismasted &quot;Kingston&quot;.

Though he would have preferred to take his prizes home Barry was now closer to Europe. Prevailing westerly winds clinched the matter, prompting him to head for France. The eastward passage was slow and stormy, but the convoy reached Groix Roads on 17 October.

&quot;Alliance&quot; got underway again on 9 December 1782 for the West Indies.

==1783==
At the end of a largely uneventful passage, she anchored off Saint-Pierre, Martinique, on 8 January 1783. There Barry found orders to sail to Havana to pick up a large quantity of gold and to deliver it to Congress at Philadelphia. After brief repairs, &quot;Alliance&quot; resumed her voyage on the 13th, touched at St. Eustatius and Cape Francois, and reached Havana on the last day of January.

Another American warship, , was already in port on the same mission. The specie had already been loaded on &quot;Duc de Lauzun&quot; and Barry decided to escort her home. The inevitable delays kept both ships in port until 6 March. The next day, they encountered two Royal Navy frigates that gave chase. Barry chose not to fight these warships rather than risk losing the funds his consort carried, and the American vessels successfully eluded their pursuers. Three days later they encountered the same pair – and – in company with the sloop-of-war HMS &quot;Tobago&quot;.

Still striving to avoid risk to the desperately needed money he was carrying to Congress, Barry again headed southwest to escape from these unidentified strangers and ordered her consort to follow. Far off in that direction, the rigging of another ship appeared over the horizon, sailing away from the others.

Soon &quot;Alliance&quot; was noticeably pulling away from the pursuers but &quot;Duc de Lauzun&quot; – second in line – was losing ground to &quot;Alarm&quot;. In the distance, the newcomer was seen to change course and head toward &quot;Alliance&quot;. &quot;Alarm&quot; evidently gave up the chase and headed away. &quot;Sybil&quot; pressed on and soon began firing at &quot;Duc de Lauzun&quot;.

Confident in both &quot;Alliance&#x27;s&quot; speed and her fighting ability, Barry maneuvered her between &quot;Sybil&quot; and &quot;Duc De Lauzun&quot; to demand the full attention of the former so that the latter might slip away to safety. &quot;Sybil&quot; then turned her fire toward &quot;Alliance&quot; and managed to send one shot from her bow chaser into the American frigate&#x27;s cabin, mortally wounding a junior officer and scattering many splinters. Yet Barry held &quot;Alliance&#x27;s&quot; fire until she was within a &quot;pistol&#x27;s shot&quot; of her opponent. At that point, a broadside from the American warship opened some 40 minutes of close-in fighting which finally forced &quot;Sybil&quot; to flee in the wake of &quot;Alarm&quot; and &quot;Tobago&quot;. Ships&#x27; logs indicate that this battle was fought south of Cape Canaveral on 10 March 1783. Captain Vashon, commander HMS Sybil, is recorded as saying &quot;he had never seen a ship so ably fought as the Alliance.&quot; Captain Vashon is further quoted as saying of Barry, &quot;every quality of a great commander was brought out with extraordinary brilliancy&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Treaty of Paris which ended the war and recognized the independence of the United States had been ratified on 3 February 1783, some five weeks before the battle.

The two American ships again headed home on the day following their brush with the British, 11 March, but separated off Cape Hatteras a week later. On the 19th, &quot;Alliance&quot; met a British ship of the line as she headed in toward the Delaware capes. She gave chase and forced &quot;Alliance&quot; back out to sea. This created a diversion which allowed &quot;Duc De Lauzun&quot; to slip into the Delaware unmolested and ascend the river to Philadelphia.

&quot;Alliance&quot; continued on northward and arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, at midafternoon on 20 March 1783. Since that port could easily be raided by British men-of-war, she soon proceeded up Narragansett Bay and anchored just below Providence. There, her crew was reduced to peacetime needs, and she was thoroughly overhauled.

Ordered to proceed to Chesapeake Bay to take on a cargo of tobacco for shipment to Europe, the frigate got underway on 20 June, but, headed for sea, she struck a rock and was stranded until high tide. Upon floating free, &quot;Alliance&quot; still seemed to be tight and resumed her voyage via the Virginia Capes and the lower Chesapeake Bay to the Rappahannock River. She then moved up that river where she began taking on tobacco. When completely loaded, she headed downstream on 21 August and sailed into the Atlantic three days later.

Soon after the ship entered the open sea, water rose rapidly in her hold. A hasty investigation revealed that a leak had developed where she had struck the rock weeks before. The crew&#x27;s attempts to stem the influx failed, forcing Barry to head for the Delaware.

Further examination of the ship at Philadelphia ruled out any quick remedy and caused Congress to cancel the voyage. Her tobacco was transferred to other ships and her crew was further reduced to the bare minimum necessary to keep her in reasonably satisfactory condition. When the survey board reported that the necessary repairs would be quite expensive, no funds were available for the task.

==1785–1788==
It seems that the work was never done before &quot;Alliance&quot; – the last ship left in the Continental Navy – was sold in Philadelphia on 1 August 1785 to John Coburn and a partner named Whitehead. These gentlemen subsequently sold her to Robert Morris who converted the vessel to an East Indiaman. Her new owner – who, as the guiding spirit on naval matters in the Continental Congress and that body&#x27;s Agent of Marine in the later years of the American struggle for independence, had directed her operations – selected Thomas Read as her master during her first merchant service. That former captain in the Continental Navy took her to China by a new route through the Dutch East Indies and the Solomon Islands. She departed Philadelphia in June 1787 and arrived at Canton on 22 December of that year. While passing through the Carolines on the outward voyage Read found two islands which were not on his chart and named the first – probably Ponape – Morris, and the second, Alliance. At Canton he loaded the ship with tea which he delivered back at Philadelphia on 17 September 1788, ending a record voyage.

&quot;On her voyage to China, she had for her commander, Thomas Reed; first- mate, the late Commodore Dale; and for supercargo, the late George Harrison, of Chestnut street.

It is recorded thus: &quot;September 19, 1788, the ship &#x27; Alliance,&#x27; Thomas Reed commander, and George Harrison supercargo, arrived from Canton, consigned to Isaac Hazlehurst &amp; Co.,&quot; of which Robert Morris was the company.

The ship was seven hundred and twenty-four tons register: a very large ship in those days.&quot;

==After 1788==
An 1860 source states, &quot;Mr. [Robert] Morris bought the United States frigate &quot;Alliance,&quot; and fitted her up and out for the East Indies, in which she made but one voyage to China, and was condemned on her return as unseaworthy, dismantled, and drifted to Petty&#x27;s Island— where &#x27;tis said some of her ribs yet perpetuate the fact of her existence.&quot;
At low tide, some of her timbers could be seen in the sands there until her remaining hulk was destroyed during dredging operations in 1901.

<doc id="256471" wikidata="Q26085" url="?curid=256471" title="The Day of the Jackal">
<text>The Day of the Jackal (1971) is a political thriller novel by English author Frederick Forsyth about a professional assassin who is contracted by the OAS, a French dissident paramilitary organisation, to kill Charles de Gaulle, the president of France.

The novel received admiring reviews and praise when first published in 1971, and it received a 1972 Best Novel Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America. The novel remains popular, and in 2003 it was listed on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read.

The novel begins as historical fiction: the OAS, as described, did exist and did conspire to commit the act, which the book opens with, giving an accurate depiction of the attempt to assassinate de Gaulle by Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry on 22 August 1962. The subsequent plot, however, is fiction.

==Plot==

===Part One: Anatomy of a Plot===
The book begins in 1962 with the (historical) failed attempt on de Gaulle&#x27;s life plotted by, among others, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart. Following the arrest of Bastien-Thiry and various other conspirators, the French security forces wage a short but extremely vicious underground war with the terrorists of the OAS, a militant right-wing group who believe de Gaulle to be a traitor to France after the Évian Accords granted Algeria her independence.

The French secret service SDECE, particularly its covert operations directorate (the Action Service), is remarkably effective in infiltrating the terrorist organisation with their own informants, allowing them to seize and interrogate the OAS operations commander, Antoine Argoud. The failure of the Petit-Clamart assassination, and a subsequent betrayal of the next attempt on de Gaulle&#x27;s life at the École Militaire, compounded by Bastien-Thiry&#x27;s eventual execution by firing squad, likewise demoralise the antagonists.

Argoud&#x27;s deputy, Lt-Col Marc Rodin, carefully examines what few options they have remaining and establishes that the only way to succeed in killing de Gaulle is to hire a professional mercenary from outside the organisation, who is completely unknown to both the French government and the OAS itself. After extensive inquiries, he contacts an unnamed English hitman, who meets with Rodin and his two principal deputies in Vienna, and agrees to assassinate de Gaulle, although he demands a total of US$500,000 (roughly US$ million in currency). The killer further requires that half of the amount be paid in advance and the rest on completion. Lastly, the hired assassin chooses a code name, &quot;The Jackal&quot; which Rodin, the leader, agrees to. The triumvirate of OAS commanders then take up residency on the top floor of a hotel in Rome guarded by a group of ex-legionnaires to avoid the risk of being captured like Argoud and subsequently revealing the assassination plot under interrogation, and also to minimise the possibility of being executed.

The remainder of this part describes the Jackal&#x27;s exhaustive preparations for the forthcoming project. He first acquires a legitimate British passport under a fake name, &quot;Alexander Duggan&quot;, which he intends to use for most of his operation. He then steals the passports of two foreign tourists visiting London who superficially resemble him for use as contingency identities. Masquerading as Duggan, the Jackal travels to Brussels, where he commissions a master gunsmith to build him a special suppressed sniper rifle of extreme slimness with a small supply of mercury-tipped explosive bullets. He also acquires a set of forged French identity papers from a professional forger. The latter makes the mistake of attempting to blackmail him, for which the Jackal kills him and locks his body in a large trunk where he determines it will not be found for a considerable time. After exhaustively researching a series of books and articles by and about de Gaulle, the Jackal travels to Paris to reconnoitre the most favourable spot and the best possible day for the assassination.

Following a series of armed robberies in France, the OAS is able to deposit the first half of the Jackal&#x27;s fee in his Swiss bank account. Meanwhile, the French authorities, suspicious about Rodin and his subordinates never leaving the hotel for weeks, compose and dispatch a fake letter that lures Viktor Kowalski, one of Rodin&#x27;s bodyguards (and a hulking giant) to France, where he is caught and tortured to reveal what he knows. Interpreting his incoherent ramblings, the secret service is able to decipher the bare bones of Rodin&#x27;s plot, and the name &quot;Jackal&quot;, but know nothing of the assassin himself. When informed of the plan, de Gaulle (who in real life was notoriously careless of his personal security) refuses to cancel any public appearances, modify his normal routines, or even allow any kind of public inquiry into the assassin&#x27;s whereabouts to be made: any investigation, he orders, must be done in absolute secrecy.

Roger Frey, the French Minister of the Interior, organises a conference of the heads of the French security authorities. Because Rodin and his men are in a foreign hotel under heavy guard, kidnapping them for interrogation will be impossible (unless it is achieved through a commando-style operation), nor can they be assassinated. The rest of the meeting is at a loss to suggest how to proceed, until a Commissioner of the Police Judiciaire reasons that their first and most essential objective is to establish the Jackal&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; identity, which is something that he insists is &quot;pure detective work&quot;. When Frey asks him to suggest the best detective in France, he volunteers his own deputy commissioner: Claude Lebel.

===Part Two: Anatomy of a Manhunt===
Granted special emergency powers to conduct his investigation, Lebel does everything possible to uncover the Jackal&#x27;s identity. He first calls upon his old boy network of foreign intelligence and police contacts to inquire if they have any records of a top-class political assassin. Most of the inquiries are fruitless, but in the United Kingdom, the matter is eventually passed on to the Special Branch of Scotland Yard, and another veteran detective, Superintendent Bryn Thomas.

A search through Special Branch&#x27;s records turns up nothing. However, one of Thomas&#x27;s subordinates suggests that if the assassin were an Englishman, but primarily operated abroad, he would most probably come to the attention of the Secret Intelligence Service. Thomas makes an informal inquiry with a friend of his on the SIS&#x27;s staff, who mentions hearing a rumour from an officer stationed in the Dominican Republic at the time of President Trujillo&#x27;s assassination. The rumour states that a hired assassin stopped Trujillo&#x27;s car with a rifle shot, allowing a gang of partisans to finish him off. Additionally, Thomas also learns that the assassin was an Englishman, whom he identifies as a man named Charles Calthrop.

Thomas is then surprised when he receives a summons in person to report to the Prime Minister (unnamed, but most probably intended to represent Harold Macmillan), who informs him that word of his inquiries has reached higher circles in the British government. Despite the enmity felt by much of the government against France in general and, more precisely, de Gaulle, the Prime Minister informs Thomas that de Gaulle is his friend, and that the assassin &quot;must&quot; be identified and stopped, with limitless resources, manpower and expenses at Thomas&#x27; disposal. Thomas is handed a commission similar to Lebel&#x27;s, with temporary powers allowing him to override almost any other authority in the land. Checking out the name of Charles Calthrop, Thomas finds a match to a man living in London, said to be on holiday. While Thomas confirms that this Calthrop &quot;was&quot; indeed in the Dominican Republic at the time of Trujillo&#x27;s death, he does not believe it justifies informing Lebel, until one of his junior detectives realises that the first three letters of his first name and surname (i.e. &quot;CHA-rles CAL-throp&quot;) forms &quot;Chacal&quot;, the French word for &quot;Jackal&quot;.

Unknown to any member of the council in France, there is an OAS mole among them: the mistress of an arrogant Air Force colonel attached to de Gaulle&#x27;s staff. Through pillow talk, the officer unwittingly feeds her a constant stream of information as to Lebel&#x27;s progress. The Englishman enters France through Italy, driving a rented Alfa Romeo sports car with his weapon soldered to the chassis. Although he receives word from the OAS agent that the French are on the lookout for him, he assesses that he will succeed whatever happens and decides to take the risk. In London, the Special Branch raids Calthrop&#x27;s flat, finding his passport, and deduce that he must be travelling on a fake identity. When they discover that the Jackal is travelling in the name of Duggan, Lebel and a police force come close to apprehending him in the south of France, but owing to his OAS contact, he leaves his hotel early and evades them by only an hour. With the police on the lookout for him, the Jackal seeks refuge in the château of a woman whom he encountered and seduced at the hotel. When she searches his belongings and finds the component parts of his rifle, he kills her before she can alert anybody and flees after disguising himself as the first of his two emergency identities. Before leaving this region, he disposes of Duggan&#x27;s belongings in a ravine. The woman&#x27;s murder is not reported until later that day, allowing the Jackal to board a train for Paris.

===Part Three: Anatomy of a Kill===
Having failed to capture the Jackal at least twice, and with each imminent arrest happening hours after the conference was informed, Lebel becomes suspicious of what the rest of the council label the killer&#x27;s apparent &quot;good luck&quot;, and has the telephones of all the members tapped, which leads him to discover the OAS female agent. The disgraced Air Force colonel withdraws from the meeting and subsequently submits his resignation. When Thomas checks out and identifies reports of stolen or missing passports in London in the preceding months, he closes in on the Jackal&#x27;s remaining secondary identities. Meanwhile, the Jackal slips into a small hotel upon arriving in Paris (narrowly evading a police checkpoint as he does), disposes of his first emergency identity, and disguises himself as the owner of the second stolen passport.

During a council meeting on 22 August 1963, Lebel deduces that the killer has decided to target de Gaulle three days later on 25 August, which commemorates the liberation of Paris during World War II. It is, he realises, the one day of the year when de Gaulle can definitely be counted on to be in Paris and make a public appearance. De Gaulle also authorises Lebel to release the Jackal&#x27;s most updated picture and name to the newspapers, identifying him as a wanted man. Believing the inquiry to be over, the Minister orchestrates a massive, citywide manhunt for the foreigner now that he can be publicly reported as a murderer, dismissing Lebel with hearty congratulations – but the killer eludes them yet again: slipping into a gay bar while masquerading as his second contingency identity, he gets himself picked up by a local man and taken to his flat, where he kills him after a news update reports that &quot;Martin Schulberg&quot; (whose identity the Englishman is using) is wanted for murder, and waits out the remaining days.

On the 24th, Roger Frey summons Lebel yet again and tells him that the Jackal still cannot be found. The detective listens to the details of the President&#x27;s schedule and security arrangements, but can suggest nothing more helpful than that everyone &quot;should keep their eyes open&quot;, much to the Minister&#x27;s dismay. On the 25th itself, the Jackal, masquerading as a one-legged French war veteran, passes through the security checkpoints carrying his custom gun concealed in the sections of a crutch. He makes his way to an apartment building overlooking the Place du 18 Juin 1940 (in front of the soon-to-be-demolished façade of the Gare Montparnasse), where de Gaulle is presenting medals to a small group of Resistance veterans. As the ceremony begins, Lebel is walking around the street, questioning and re-questioning every police checkpoint. When he hears from one CRS guard about a one-legged veteran with a crutch, he realises what the Jackal&#x27;s plan is, and rushes into the apartment building, calling for the patrol to follow him.

Having sneaked into a suitable apartment to shoot from, the Jackal prepares his weapon and takes aim at de Gaulle&#x27;s head, but his first shot misses by a fraction of an inch when the President unexpectedly leans forward to kiss the cheeks of the veteran he is honouring. Outside the apartment, Lebel and the CRS man arrive on the top floor in time to hear the sound of the first, silenced shot. The CRS guard shoots off the door lock and bursts in as the Jackal is reloading: the Englishman turns and fires, killing him with a shot to the chest. At this point, the detective and the assassin, having developed grudging respect for each other during the pursuit, share a brief glance of recognition. The Jackal scrambles to load his third and last bullet while the unarmed Lebel snatches up the dead policeman&#x27;s submachine-gun: Lebel is faster and shoots the Jackal with half a magazine-load of 9mm bullets, killing him instantly.

===Epilogue===
In London, the Special Branch are searching Calthrop&#x27;s apartment when the real Charles Calthrop storms in and demands to know what they are doing. Once it is established that Calthrop truly has been on holiday in Scotland and is totally separate from the killer, the British are left to wonder &quot;if the Jackal wasn&#x27;t Calthrop, then &quot;who the hell was he&quot;?&quot;

The Jackal is buried in an unmarked grave in a Paris cemetery, officially recorded as &quot;an unknown foreign tourist, killed in a car accident.&quot; Aside from a priest, a policeman, registrar and grave-diggers, the only other person attending the burial is Inspector Claude Lebel, who then leaves the cemetery to return home.

==Origins==

Over the three years immediately prior to his writing &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot;, Frederick Forsyth spent most of his time in West Africa covering the Biafran war, first for the BBC in 1967 and then for another eighteen months as a freelance journalist in 1968–1969. Upon his return to Britain his first book, the non-fiction &quot;The Biafra Story: The Making of an African Legend&quot; about that brutal civil war during which Nigeria fought to prevent the secession of its eastern province, was published as a paperback by Penguin Books in late 1969. To Forsyth&#x27;s disappointment, however, the book sold very few copies and so with the arrival of the 1970s the then 31 year-old freelance journalist, international adventurer, and onetime youngest (at 19) fighter pilot in the RAF found himself both out of work and &quot;flat broke&quot;. To solve his financial problems he thus decided to try his hand at fiction by writing a political thriller as a &quot;one-off&quot; project to &quot;clear his debts&quot;. Unlike most novelists, however, Forsyth would employ the same type of research techniques that he had used as an investigative reporter to bring a sense of increased reality to his work of fiction, a story which he first began to consider writing in 1962–1963 while posted to Paris as a young Reuters foreign correspondent.

When Forsyth arrived in 1962, French president Charles de Gaulle had just granted independence to Algeria to end the eight-year Algerian War, a highly controversial act that had incurred the wrath of the anti-decolonisation paramilitary group &quot;Organisation Armée Secrète&quot; (OAS) which then vowed to assassinate him. Forsyth befriended several of the President&#x27;s bodyguards and personally reported from the scene of the failed August 1962 assassination attempt along the Avenue de la Libération during which de Gaulle and his wife narrowly escaped death in a fusillade of gunfire in the roadside ambush, the most serious of six overall attempts the OAS would make on his life. Forsyth incorporated an account of that real-life event to open his new novel throughout which he also employed many other aspects and details about France, its politics, the OAS, and international law enforcement that he had learned during his career as an investigative journalist. Forsyth noted that virtually all OAS members and sympathizers were known to, and under surveillance by, French authorities—a key factor in the failure of their assassination attempts. In his 2015 memoir &quot;The Outsider&quot;, Forsyth wrote that during his time in France he briefly considered that the OAS might assassinate de Gaulle if they hired a man or men who were completely unknown to French authorities – an idea he would later expand upon in &quot;Jackal&quot;.

== Publishing history ==

Although Forsyth wrote &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; in 35 days in January and February 1970, it remained unpublished for almost a year and a half thereafter as he sought a publisher willing to accept his unsolicited 140,000-word manuscript. Four publishing houses rejected it between February and September because their editors believed a fictional account of the OAS hiring a British assassin in 1963 to kill Charles de Gaulle would not be commercially successful, given the fact that he had never been shot and, when the book was written, de Gaulle was in fact still alive and retired from public life.

The editors told Forsyth that they felt that these well-known facts essentially abrogated the suspense of his fictional assassination plot against de Gaulle as readers would already know it would not and could not possibly have been successful. (De Gaulle subsequently died of natural causes at his country home in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises in November 1970 after peacefully retiring.) After these rejections Forsyth took a different strategy and wrote a short summary of the novel to present to publishers, noting that the focus was &quot;not&quot; on the plausibility of the assassination itself, but rather on the technical details and manhunt. He persuaded London-based Hutchinson &amp; Co. to take a chance on publishing his novel; however, they only agreed to a relatively small initial printing of just 8,000 copies for its 358-page red and gold clothbound first edition. Forsyth was signed to a three-book contract: a £500 advance for &quot;Jackal&quot;, followed by another £6,000 advance for the second and third novels. Although the book was not formally reviewed by the press prior to its initial June 1971 UK publication, widespread word of mouth resulted in brisk advance and post-publication sales leading to repeated additional printings.

The book&#x27;s unexpected success in Britain soon attracted the attention of Viking Press in New York which quickly acquired the US publication rights for $365,000 (£100,000)—then a very substantial sum for such a work and especially for that of a first-time author. These fees (the equivalent of $ million in ) were split equally between Hutchinson and Forsyth, which led the self-described &quot;flat broke&quot; author to observe later that he had &quot;never seen money like it and never thought I would.&quot; Just two months after its publication in the UK the 380-page clothbound Viking first edition was released in the US at $7.95 and with a distinctive jacket designed by noted American artist Paul Bacon.
The first US edition&#x27;s launch was considerably aided by two glowing reviews in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by senior daily book reviewer Christopher Lehmann-Haupt three days before its release, and by the American mystery writer Stanley Bernard Ellin the week after. In mid-October it reached No. 1 on the &quot;Times&quot; Best Seller List for fiction and by mid-December 136,000 copies of Viking&#x27;s US edition were already in print. Over two-and-a-half million copies were sold worldwide by 1975. As in the UK, over forty years later &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; still remains in print in the US published now by Penguin Books (which acquired Viking in 1975) as a New American Library imprint. Hundreds of other print, electronic, and audio editions have been produced around the world since 1971 with many more millions of copies now in print in both English and the thirty other languages into which it has been translated including Spanish, German, French, Russian, Turkish, Czech, Polish, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Hebrew, Latvian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.

&quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; was published in serial format in 1971 in both the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; and Israel&#x27;s oldest daily newspaper, &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;. Earning Forsyth the 1972 Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel, in 1973 it was also made into a 143-minute feature film directed by Fred Zinnemann. In 2011 a number of special &quot;40th Anniversary&quot; editions of &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; were released in the UK, US, and elsewhere to commemorate the four decades of continuous success of the book, the first of 18 more Forsyth novels and collections of his short stories published since the 1971 release of his seminal debut thriller.

== Film adaptations ==
* The film &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; was released in 1973, directed by Fred Zinnemann and starring Edward Fox as The Jackal, Michael Lonsdale as Lebel, and Derek Jacobi as Caron. It follows the novel rather faithfully although it has several cosmetic changes.
* An Indian film in Malayalam titled &quot;August 1&quot; (1988), directed by Sibi Malayil, is loosely based on the novel. It stars Mammootty, Captain Raju and Sukumaran in pivotal roles.
* A film titled &quot;The Jackal&quot;, directed by Michael Caton-Jones, was released in 1997. The film bears little resemblance to the plot of the novel or the original film, featuring an unnamed assassin (Bruce Willis) being hired by the Russian mafia to kill the First Lady of the United States. Both Zinnemann and Forsyth lobbied to have the film&#x27;s name changed to disassociate it from Forsyth&#x27;s novel.

== Television adaptation ==

Sky and Peacock ordered a television series adaptation of the novel, produced by Carnival Films and Sky Studios with Ronan Bennett as showrunner and Brian Kirk as director. Eddie Redmayne plays the Jackal.

== Influence on later events ==
The method for acquiring a false identity and UK passport detailed in the book is often referred to as the &quot;Day of the Jackal fraud&quot; and remained a well known security loophole in the UK until 2007. The New Zealand Member of Parliament David Garrett claimed the novel&#x27;s description of identity theft inspired him to create his own fake passport as a &quot;youthful prank&quot;. The incident further inflamed a national controversy over the law and order campaigner&#x27;s criminal history.

In 1975, the Venezuelan terrorist Carlos was dubbed &quot;The Jackal&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot; after one of its correspondents reportedly spotted the novel near some of the fugitive&#x27;s belongings.

A copy of the Hebrew translation of &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; was found in possession of Yigal Amir, the Israeli who in 1995 assassinated Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister of Israel.

Would-be assassin Vladimir Arutinian, who attempted to kill US president George W. Bush during his 2005 visit to the Republic of Georgia, was an obsessive reader of the novel and kept an annotated version of it during his planning for the assassination.

<doc id="256485" wikidata="Q1484" url="?curid=256485" title="Mayon">
<text>Mayon (; , ), also known as Mount Mayon and Mayon Volcano is an active stratovolcano in the province of Albay in Bicol, Philippines. A popular tourist spot, it is renowned for its &quot;perfect cone&quot; because of its symmetric conical shape, and is regarded as sacred in Philippine mythology.

The volcano with its surrounding landscape was declared a national park on July 20, 1938, the first in the nation. It was reclassified as a natural park and renamed the Mayon Volcano Natural Park in 2000. It is the centerpiece of the Albay Biosphere Reserve, declared by UNESCO in 2016, and is currently being nominated as a World Heritage Site.

Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines, and its activity is regularly monitored by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) from their provincial headquarters on Ligñon Hill, about from the summit.

== Geography ==

Mayon is the main landmark and highest point of the province of Albay and the whole Bicol Region in the Philippines, rising from the shores of Albay Gulf about away. The volcano is geographically shared by the eight cities and municipalities of Legazpi, Daraga, Camalig, Guinobatan, Ligao, Tabaco, Malilipot, and Santo Domingo (clockwise from Legazpi), which divide the cone like slices of a pie when viewing a map of their political boundaries.

== Geology ==
Mayon is a classic stratovolcano with a small central summit crater. It is one of the world&#x27;s most symmetrical volcanic cones.

The concave profile, a hyperbolic sine curve of the volcano is due to the balance between erosion and eruption, defined by the angle of repose of ash. The steepest upper slopes of the volcano reach an average slope gradient of 75%, while the lower foot slope is only an average of 3%. The volcanic crater is about 250 m in diameter. At least 85 lava flows have been identified, and consist mainly of lava augite-hypersthene-andesite, generally fed from the crater. Pyroclastic flows, characterized as a St. Vincent nuee&#x27; ardente, leave behind block and ash deposits, and breadcrust bombs in an ash and lapilli matrix. The farthest flow reached 8.5 km along Fidel Surtida, Santo Domingo. Mayon lahars were formed by rainstorms during eruptions, or by torrential rain afterwards. Averaging 230 m in height and 710 m in diameter, 7 cinder cones are found on the southern and southwestern lower slopes. Composed of olivine-augite basalt, these cones have an angle of repose of 34%, with Ligñon Hill as an example.

Like other volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, Mayon is a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. It is on the southeast side of Luzon. The Bicol Arc is one of 7 oceanic trench subduction zones defining the Philippine Mobile Belt. Volcanism in the Bicol Arc is related to the westward subduction of the Philippine Plate along the Philippine Trench. The 12 active and inactive volcanoes within the arc include the Mayon Volcano, Mount Bulusan, Mount Isarog, Mount Iriga, Malinao Volcano, and Mount Masaraga. In general, these are calc-alkali basalts, basaltic andesites, and andesites.

In August 2021, soils from Mayon have been found containing bacterial species with potential antibiotic and anti-cancer properties.

== Recorded eruptions ==
Mayon is the most active volcano in the Philippines, erupting over 52 times in the past 500 years. Historical observations accounted its first eruption in 1616. The first eruption for which an extended account exists was the six-day event of July 20, 1766.

Its most destructive recorded eruption occurred on February 1 (VEI=4). Lava flowed but less than the 1766 eruption. The volcano belched dark ash and eventually bombarded the town of Cagsawa with tephra that buried it. Trees burned, and rivers were certainly damaged. Proximate areas were also devastated by the eruption, with ash accumulating to in depth. In Cagsawa town, about 1,200 locals perished in what is considered to be the most lethal eruption in Mayon&#x27;s history according to PHIVOLCS. The 1814 eruption is believed to have contributed to the accumulation of atmospheric ash together with the catastrophic 1815 eruption of other volcanoes like Indonesia&#x27;s Mount Tambora, leading to the Year Without a Summer in 1816.

=== 1881–1882 eruption ===
From July 6, 1881, until approximately August 1882, Mayon underwent a strong (VEI=3) eruption. Samuel Kneeland, a naturalist, professor and geologist, personally observed the volcanic activity on Christmas Day, 1881, about five months after the start of the activity:

At the date of my visit, the volcano had poured out, for five months continuously, a stream of lava on the Legaspi side from the very summit. The viscid mass bubbled quietly but grandly, and overran the border of the crater, descending several hundred feet in a glowing wave, like red-hot iron. Gradually, fading as the upper surface cooled, it changed to a thousand sparkling rills among the crevices, and, as it passed beyond the line of complete vision behind the woods near the base, the fires twinkled like stars or the scintillations of a dying conflagration. More than half of the mountain height was thus illuminated.
=== 1897 eruption ===

Mayon&#x27;s longest uninterrupted eruption occurred on June 23 (VEI=4), and lasted for seven days. Lava once again flowed down to towns eastward, the village of Bacacay was buried beneath the lava. In Santo Domingo 100 people were killed by steam and falling debris or hot rocks. Other villages like San Roque, Santa Misericordia and Santo Niño became deathtraps. Ash was carried in black clouds as far as from the catastrophic event, which killed more than 400 people.

=== 1984 and 1993 eruptions ===

No casualties were recorded from the 1984 eruption after more than 73,000 people were evacuated from the danger zones as recommended by PHIVOLCS scientists. But in 1993, pyroclastic flows killed 79 people, mainly farmers, during the eruption that also forced 50,000 residents evacuated, according to the Albay provincial government.

=== 1999 eruption ===
Mayon began its increasing activity in May, with hazard status associated raised to Alert Level 1. On June 22, Mayon emitted an ash column that rose to approximately 10 km above the vent; the status was later raised to Alert Level 2. The emission was recorded by the seismic network of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology as an explosion that lasted for 10 minutes. No volcanic earthquakes nor other visible signs of abnormal activity were observed before the explosion.

=== 2000 eruptions ===
Mayon had experienced continuous emissions since 1999 and followed by a series of eruptions in the next two consecutive years.

On January 5, a 5-km-high ash column was produced by an explosion. Growth of summit-crater dome and intensifying eruptions later signaled evacuations.

Past emissions had led to the growth of the lava dome beginning on February 12. On February 23, series of eruptions began. PHIVOLCS then recommended evacuation even beyond the permanent danger zone. On February 24, PHIVOLCS raised its status to the highest, Alert Level 5, with at least eight towns and one city warned of possible explosions with ash and lava flows, and several thousands forced to evacuate even outside identified danger zones. The most violent eruptions were occurred from February 28 to March 1, and since then, declining activity was observed until April.

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDCC)reported that the 2000 eruption displaced 14,114 families (68,426 persons) and damaged at least ₱89-million worth of property and crops.

=== 2001 eruption ===
The NDCC reported that another eruption in July affected 11,529 families (56,853 persons) and damaged at least ₱48-million worth of property and crops.

=== 2006 eruptions ===

Mayon&#x27;s 48th modern-era eruption occurred on July 13, followed by quiet effusion of lava that started on July 14. Nearly 40,000 people were evacuated from the danger zone on the southeast flank of the volcano.

After an ash explosion on September 1, a general decline in the overall activity of Mayon was established. The decrease in key parameters such as seismicity, sulfur dioxide emission rates and ground inflation all indicated a waning condition. The slowdown in the eruptive activity was also evident from the decrease in intensity of crater glow and the diminishing volume of lava extruded from the summit. PHILVOLCS Alert Level 4 was lowered to Level 3 on September 11; to Level 2 on October 3; and to Level 1 on October 25.

=== 2008 eruption ===
On August 10, a small summit explosion ejected ash above the summit, which drifted east-northeast. In the weeks prior to the eruption, a visible glow increased within the crater and increased seismicity.

=== 2009–2010 eruptions ===
On July 10, 2009, PHIVOLCS raised the status from Alert Level 1 (low level unrest) to Alert Level 2 (moderate unrest) because the number of recorded low frequency volcanic earthquakes rose to the same level as those prior to the 2008 phreatic explosion.

At 5:32 a.m. on October 28, a minor ash explosion lasting for about one minute occurred in the summit crater. A brown ash column rose about above the crater and drifted northeast. In the prior 24 hours, 13 volcanic earthquakes were recorded. Steam emission was at moderate level, creeping downslope toward the southwest. PHIVOLCS maintained the Alert Status at Level 2, but later warned that with the approach of tropical cyclone international codename Mirinae, the danger of lahars and possible crater wall collapse would greatly increase and all specified precautions should be taken.

After dawn, field investigation showed ashfall had drifted southwest of the volcano. In the 24-hour period, the seismic network recorded 20 volcanic earthquakes. Alert Status was kept at Level 2.
At 8 pm on December 14, after 83 volcanic quakes in the preceding 24 hours and increased sulfur dioxide emissions, PHIVOLCS raised the Alert status to Level 3.

Early in the morning of December 15, a moderate ash explosion occurred at the summit crater and &quot;quiet extrusion of lava&quot; resulted in flows down to about from the summit. By evening, Albay Province authorities evacuated about 20,000 residents out of the danger zone and into local evacuation centres. About 50,000 people live within the zone.

On December 17, five ash ejections occurred, with one reaching above the summit. Sulfur dioxide emission increased to 2,758 tonnes per 24 hours, lava flows reached down to below the summit, and incandescent fragments from the lava pile continuously rolling down Bonga Gully reached a distance of 3–4 km below the summit. By midday, a total of 33,833 people from 7,103 families had been evacuated, 72 percent of the total number of people that needed to be evacuated, according to Albay Governor Joey Salceda.

On December 20, PHIVOLCS raised Mayon&#x27;s status level to alert level 4 because of an increasing lava flow in the southern portion of the volcano and an increase in sulfur dioxide emission to 750 tonnes per day. Almost 460 earthquakes in the volcano were monitored. In the border of the danger zone, rumbling sounds like thunder were heard. Over 9,000 families (44,394 people) were evacuated by the Philippine government from the base of the volcano. No civilian was permitted within the 8 km danger zone, which was cordoned off by the Philippine military who actively patrolled to enforce the &quot;no-go&quot; rule and to ensure no damage or loss of property of those evacuated.
Alert level 4 was maintained as the volcano remained restive through December, prompting affected residents to spend Christmas and the New Year in evacuation centers. On December 25, sulfur dioxide emissions peaked at 8,993 tons per day. On December 28, PHIVOLCS director Renato Solidum commented on the status of the volcano, &quot;You might think it is taking a break but the volcano is still swelling.&quot; On the next day December 29, a civil aviation warning for the airspace near the summit was included in the volcano bulletins. The ejected volcanic material since the start of the eruption was estimated to have been between 20 million to 23 million cubic meters of rocks and volcanic debris, compared to 50 million to 60 million cubic meters in past eruptions.

On January 2, 2010, PHIVOLCS lowered the alert level of the volcano from level 4 to level 3, citing decreasing activity observed over the prior four days. The state agency noted the absence of ash ejections and relative weakness of steam emissions and the gradual decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions from a maximum of 8,993 tonnes per day to 2,621 tonnes per day. 7,218 families within the 7–8 km danger zones returned to their homes, while 2,728 families residing in the 4–6 km danger zone remained in the evacuation centers pending a decision to further lower the alert level.

On January 13, PHIVOLCS reduced the Alert Level from 3 to 2 due to a further reduction in the likelihood of hazardous eruption.

==== Government response ====

Albay governor Joey Salceda declared the disaster zone an &#x27;open city&#x27; area to encourage aid from external groups. Potential donors of relief goods were not required to secure clearance from the Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council, and were coordinated directly with support groups at the local government level.

The restiveness of the volcano also stimulated the tourism industry of the province. Up to 2,400 tourists per day arrived in the area in the two weeks after the volcano started erupting on December 14, filling local hotels, compared to a more modest average of 200 in the days prior. However, it was reported that some tourists lured by local &quot;guides&quot; ignored government warnings not to venture into the danger zone. &quot;It&#x27;s a big problem. I think the first violation of the zero casualty (record) will be a dead tourist,&quot; said Salceda.

Speaking about thrill-seekers finding their way into the area, Salceda warned, &quot;At the moment of the eruption, the local guides will have better chance of getting out. The helpless tourist will be left behind.&quot;

==== International response ====
Following the declaration of alert level 3 for the volcano, the United States issued an advisory cautioning its nationals from traveling to Mayon. Canada and the United Kingdom also posted advisories discouraging their nationals from visiting the volcano.

The United States government committed $100,000 in financial aid for the evacuees of Mayon. In cooperation with the Philippine government the assistance was delivered through the Philippine National Red Cross and other NGOs by USAID.

The Albay provincial government ordered the local military to add more checkpoints, place roadblocks and arrest tourists caught traveling inside the danger zone.

Power and water supply were cut off within the danger zone to further discourage residents from returning. The Commission on Human Rights allowed the use of emergency measures and gave the authorities clearance to forcibly evacuate residents who refused to leave.

When the alert level around the volcano was lowered from alert level 4 to alert level 3 on January 2, 2010, the Albay provincial government ordered a decampment of some 47,000 displaced residents from the evacuation centers. Power and water supply in the danger zones were restored. Military vehicles were used to transport the evacuees back to their homes, while food supplies and temporary employment through the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) were provided to the heads of each family.
As of January 3, 2010, the National Disaster Coordinating Council reported the overall cost of humanitarian aid and other assistance provided by the government and non-government organizations (NGOs) has reached over 61 million pesos since the start of the eruption.

The United Nations World Food Programme (UN-WFP) delivered 20 tons of high energy biscuits to the evacuees to complement supplies provided by the DSWD, with more allocated from emergency food stocks intended for relief from the effects of the 2009 Pacific typhoon season. When the alert level was downgraded to level 3 on January 2, 2010, UN-WFP provided three days worth of food for evacuees returning to their homes who will continue to receive supplies already set aside for them.

=== 2013 phreatic eruption ===
On May 7, at 8 a.m. (PST), the volcano produced a surprise phreatic eruption lasting 73 seconds. Ash, steam and rock were produced during this eruption. Ash clouds reached 500 meters above the volcano&#x27;s summit and drifted west southwest. The event killed five climbers, of whom three were German, one was a Spaniard living in Germany, and one was a Filipino tour guide. Seven others were reported injured. The bodies of the hikers were soon located by the authorities. However, due to rugged and slippery terrain, the hikers&#x27; remains were slowly transferred from Camp 2 to Camp 1, the site of the rescue operations at the foot of the volcano. According to Butch Rivera of Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital, the hikers died due to trauma in their bodies, and suffocation. Authorities were also able to rescue a Thai national who was unable to walk due to fatigue and had suffered a broken arm and burns on the neck and back. Despite the eruption, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology stated that the alert level would remain at 0. No volcanic earthquake activity was detected in the 24 hours prior to the eruption as no indication of further intensification of volcanic activity was observed, and no evacuation was being planned.

==== International response ====
The government of the United Kingdom advised its nationals to follow the advisories given by the local authorities, and respect the 6 km permanent danger zone. The advisory was given a day after the explosion.

=== 2014 ===
On August 12, a new 30–50 meter high lava dome appeared in the summit crater. This event was preceded by inflations of the volcano (measured by precise leveling, tilt data, and GPS), and increases in sulfur dioxide gas emissions. On September 14, rockfall events at the southeastern rim of the crater and heightened seismic activity caused PHIVOLCS to increase the alert level for Mayon from 2 to 3, which indicates relatively high unrest with magma at the crater, and that hazardous eruption is possible within weeks.

The rockfalls and visible incandescence of the crater from molten lava and hot volcanic gas both indicated a possible incipient breaching of the growing summit lava dome. On September 15, NASA&#x27;s Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) detected thermal anomalies near Mayon&#x27;s summit, consistent with magma at the surface. On September 16, provincial governor Joey Salceda said that the government would begin to &quot;fast-track the preparation to evacuate 12,000 families in the 6–8 km extended danger zone&quot;, and soldiers would enforce the no-go areas.

On September 18, PHIVOLCS reported 142 VT earthquake events and 251 rockfall events. White steam plumes drifted to the south-southwest and rain clouds covered the summit. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission was measured at a 757 tonnes after a peak of 2,360 tonnes on September 6. Deformation (precise leveling and tiltmeters) during the 3rd week of August 2014 recorded edifice inflation.

=== 2018 activity ===
On January 13, at 4:21 pm (PST), a phreatic eruption occurred that propelled a grayish steam and ash plume approximately 2500 meters high that drifted to the southwest side of the volcano. The activity lasted approximately 1 hour and 47 minutes and ash fell in Barangay Anoling, Daraga, Barangays Sua, Quirangay, Tumpa, Ilawod and Salugan of Camalig and in Barangays Tandarora, Maninila, and Travesia in Guinobatan. Sulfuric odor was noted by residents of Camalig town proper. Rumbling sounds were also heard by residents of Brgy. Anoling, Daraga and rockfall events were intermittently recorded. Faint crater glow was first observed at 10:16 pm. The event prompted PHIVOLCS to raise the Alert Level of Mayon from Alert Level 1 (abnormal) to Alert Level 2- (increasing unrest for the people&#x27;s safety). About 40,000 residents were displaced in the resulting evacuation.

On January 14, Mayon&#x27;s alert status was upgraded to Alert Level 3 (increased tendency towards a hazardous eruption) after 3 phreatic eruptions and 158 rockfall events were recorded. The summit crater also exhibited a bright glow signifying the growth of a new lava dome and the start of lava flows towards its slopes.

On January 16, the province of Albay declared a state of calamity as lava flows reached the limits of the 6-kilometer evacuation zone.

On January 22, Alert Level 4 was raised after Mayon spewed a 3-kilometer tall ash column at around 12:45 pm. Classes in all levels in private and public schools were suspended in the whole province of Albay. By evening, lava fountains were spewed from the crater with pyroclastic flows and ash plumes. Lava bombs and rockfalls could also be observed and rumbling sounds from the eruptions could be heard. The eruption type was classified as a Strombolian eruption.

On January 23, Mayon spewed 300 to 500-meter lava fountains and ash plumes with a 4 to 5-hour interval. Lava bombs and rockfalls could also be observed and sounds from the volcano could be heard. Classes in all levels, both public and private were still suspended, work in some places were suspended as well. The danger zone was expanded up to 9 kilometers despite remaining at Alert Level 4 and residents from the expanded danger zone were evacuated.

On January 24, a column of ash and lava fountains were spewed again with an interval of 4 to 5 hours. Fire bombs and rockfalls were observed and sounds from the eruptions were heard.

On January 25, a column of ash and lava fountains were spewed again. Fire bombs and rockfalls were observed and sounds from the eruptions were heard. The eruptions had an interval of 3 to 5 hours.

Alert Level 4 was maintained at the volcano for the rest of January and all throughout the month of February as it remained restive. On March 6, after observing a decline in volcanic activity, PHIVOLCS downgraded the alert level back to Alert Level 3. On March 29, after observing a further decline in activity, PHIVOLCS lowered the alert level back to Alert Level 2 signifying the end of Mayon&#x27;s eruptive activity and the volcano&#x27;s decline to a moderate level of unrest.

On December 26, Mayon caused two phreatic explosions but remained under Alert Level 2.

=== 2020 crater glow ===

On the evening of February 4, PHIVOLCS reported that the crater of Mayon showed crater glow, attributed to magma which was still present slightly underneath the surface of the volcano. Even though this phenomenon alerted the officials and the public, Mayon remained at an Alert Level 2 out of 5. The Alert Level 2 was lowered to Alert Level 1 on July 17, 2020. And on July 30, 2021, PHIVOLCS-DOST lifted the alert level status of the volcano.

=== 2022 activity ===
On October 1, Mayon released 391 tons of sulfur dioxide, and its edifice was also slightly inflated.

PHIVOLCS observed a faint crater glow at the summit of Mayon. One volcanic earthquake was detected in the last 24-hour observation period. Plumes were also seen drifting west-northwest and westward.

On October 7, the status of Mayon was raised to Alert Level 2 by PHIVOLCS, due to exhibiting &quot;increasing unrest&quot;.

=== 2023 eruption ===
On June 5, PHIVOLCS raised the status of Mayon Volcano to Alert Level 2 due to its &quot;increasing unrest&quot;, after it observed an increase in rockfall from the volcano&#x27;s summit lava dome since the last week of April, indicating aseismic growth. Rockfall increased in frequency from an average of five events per day to 49 events per day from June 4 at 5:00 a.m. to June 5 at 5:00 a.m. A total of 318 rockfall events were recorded by the Mayon Volcano Network since April 1 while 26 volcanic earthquakes were recorded for the same period.

On June 8, the alert level in Mayon was raised to Level 3, signifying &quot;increased tendency towards a hazardous eruption&quot;, and that an effusive magmatic eruption was taking place. An incandescent rockfall was recorded in the evening. On June 9, PHIVOLCS recorded six pyroclastic flows and 199 rockfall events from the volcano overnight. The province of Albay was placed under a state of calamity due to the unrest.

On June 11–12 there were more eruptions. On the night of June 15, the volcano registered its largest pyroclastic flow since the resumption of its activity, with ashfall affecting parts of Ligao and Guinobatan. On June 18, the volcano&#x27;s lava flow reached a maximum length of 1.5 kilometers from the crater, which ran down the Mi-isi gully in the south side and the Bonga gully in the southeastern side of the volcano, while debris from the summit reached as far as 3.3 kilometers from the crater.

20,000 people living within the volcano&#x27;s danger zone were evacuated. At least 628 people required medical treatment due to the effects of the eruption and complications arising from evacuation measures.

On June 30, Mayon emitted a pyroclastic flow that lasted four minutes and traveled around 3 to 4 kilometers downslope on the Basud Gully. Ashfall was reported in Tabaco City.

On December 8, PHIVOLCS lowered the volcano&#x27;s activity status to alert level 2.

=== 2024 ===
On February 4, Mayon underwent a phreatic eruption that lasted four minutes and nine seconds and produced a 1.2-kilometer high plume. On March 5, PHIVOLCS lowered the volcano&#x27;s alert status to level 1.

== Deadly lahars ==
On November 30, 2006, strong rainfall which accompanied Typhoon Durian produced lahars from the volcanic ash and boulders of the last eruption killing at least 1,266 people. The precise figure may never be known since many people were buried under the mudslides. A large portion of the village of Padang, an outer suburb of Legazpi City, was covered in mud up to the houses&#x27; roofs. Students from Aquinas University in Barangay Rawis, also in Legazpi, were among those killed as mudslides engulfed their dormitory. Central Legazpi escaped the mudslide but suffered from severe flooding and power cuts.

Parts of the town of Daraga were also devastated, including the Cagsawa area, where the ruins from the eruption of 1814 were partially buried once again. Large areas of Guinobatan were destroyed, particularly Barangay Maipon.

A similar post-eruption lahar occurred in October 1766, months after the July eruption of that year. The heavy rainfall also accompanying a violent typhoon carried down disintegrated fragmental ejecta, burying plantations and whole villages. In 1825, the event was repeated in Cagsawa killing 1,500 people.

== Monitoring ==

Three telemetric units are installed on Mayon&#x27;s slopes, which send information to the seven seismometers in different locations around the volcano. These instruments relay data to the Ligñon Hill observatory and the PHIVOLCS central headquarters on the University of the Philippines Diliman campus.

PHIVOLCS also deploys electronic distance meters (EDMs), precise leveling benchmarks, and portable fly spectrometers to monitor the volcano&#x27;s daily activity.

== Mythology ==
It is said that the volcano grew from the burial grounds of lovers Magayon and Panganoron. Thus, the ancient Bicolanos named it after the legendary princess-heroine Daragang Magayon (). After some time, the volcano was chosen as the abode of the supreme god of the Bicolano people, Gugurang, who also chose Mayon as the repository of the sacred fire of Ibalon. Numerous festivals and rituals are associated with the volcano and its landscape.

== Incidents and accidents ==
On February 23, 2023, a twin engine Cessna 340 airplane owned by the Energy Development Corporation departed Bicol International Airport in the early morning on an executive flight to the capital Manila. A few minutes after takeoff, while climbing to an altitude of , it impacted the rocky slope of Mt Mayon located about north of the airport. The wreckage was found the next day near the crater of the volcano. The airplane disintegrated on impact and all four occupants, including two Australians, were killed.

<doc id="256487" wikidata="Q2668479" url="?curid=256487" title="Price war">
<text>A price war is a form of market competition in which companies within an industry engage in aggressive pricing activity &quot;characterized by the repeated cutting of prices below those of competitors&quot;. This leads to a cycle, where each competitor attempts to match or undercut the price of the other. Competitors are driven to follow the initial price-cut due to the downward pricing pressure, referred to as “price-cutting momentum”.

Heil and Helsen (2001) proposed that a price war exists only if one or more of a set of qualitative conditions are satisfied. These conditions include: (1) a primary focus on competitors rather than consumers, (2) undesirability of pricing interactions for competitors, (3) absence of intention to start a price war by any competitor, (4) violation of industry norms through competitive interactions, (5) accelerated pricing interactions in comparison to the usual pace, (6) a downward direction of pricing, and (7) unsustainable pricing interplay.

While price wars can offer short-term benefits to consumers by providing them with lower prices, they can have a negative impact on the companies involved by reducing their profit margins. Moreover, the negative effects of price wars on companies can extend beyond the short term, as the companies involved may struggle to recover their lost profits and maintain their market share. Firms may be cautious when engaging in price wars as this competition can lead to prices that are unsustainable for long-term profitability.

==Causes==
The main reasons that price wars occur are:
*Homogenous products: Where products are homogenous, and product substitution between firms is high, then the price elasticity of demand will also be high. As a result, if one company in an industry lowers its prices, other firms offering similar products must also reduce their prices to retain their market share. 
*Penetration pricing: If a firm is trying to enter an established market, it may offer lower prices than existing brands to incentivise consumers to switch to their product.
*Oligopoly: If the industry structure is oligopolistic (that is, has few major competitors), the players will closely monitor each other&#x27;s prices and be prepared to respond to any price cuts.

:*Applying game theory, two oligopolistic firms that engage in a price war will often find themselves in a kind of prisoner’s dilemma. Indeed, if Firm A reduces it prices whilst competitor, Firm B, doesn’t reduce its prices, then Firm A can capture market share. And, if Firm A reduces its prices, then Firm B must reduce its prices to avoid being eliminated from the market. The equilibrium is such that both firms adopt a low-price strategy to protect themselves.
*Predatory pricing: One firm substantially reduces its prices for a sustained period below its own cost of supply in an attempt to reduce market competition. Predatory pricing on the international market is called dumping. That is, when a foreign company sells a product in a domestic market at a price below market value, and in doing so, causes injury to the industry in the domestic market.

==Reactions to price challenges==
The first reaction to a price reduction should always be to consider the following: 

&quot;Has the competitor decided upon a long-term price reduction or is this just a short-term promotion?&quot; 

If the competitor has implemented a short-term promotion, the ideal response is to monitor the competitor&#x27;s price changes and maintain prices at the current level. Price wars often begin when simple promotional activities are misunderstood as major strategic changes.
If the competitor is implementing a long-term price change, the following reactions may be suitable:

*Reduce price: The most obvious, and most popular reaction is to match the competitor&#x27;s move. This maintains the status quo (but reduces profits pro rata). 
*Maintain price: Another reaction is to hope that the competitor has made a mistake, but if the competitor&#x27;s action does make inroads into a merchant&#x27;s share, this can soon mean customers lose confidence and a subsequent loss of sales. 
*Split the market: Branch one product into two, selling one as premium and the other as basic. This effective tactic was notably used by Heublein, the former owner of the Smirnoff brand of vodka.
*React with other measures - Reducing price is not the only weapon. Other tactics can be used to great effect: improved quality, increased promotion (perhaps to improve the idea of quality).

==Effects of price wars==
Empirical studies suggest that price wars can significantly damage the companies that practice such behaviour. Notably, price wars can have some short term benefits for firms as it allows them to quickly turnover inventory, alleviate financial pressure, increase social purchasing power, and may compel firms to enhance their production efficiency. But these short term gains are ultimately offset by long term losses. In the long run, price wars can cause companies to incur losses in their margins, customer equity, innovation capabilities and competitive advantage. Victims of price wars may be downgraded in the market, and even incur bankruptcy. But the companies that involve themselves in price wars are not the only affected parties, as suppliers and investors will also be impacted. This can lead to compromised company image and reputation over the long run. Overall, society may suffer from less efficient allocation of resources as the resources that were poured into participating in a price war could have been allocated elsewhere. In the short term, consumers appear to benefit from lower prices during a price war. However, in the long run, consumers are likely to form unrealistic reference prices and may be faced with lower quality products.

==Examples of price wars==
Price wars are prevalent in many industries, with academic literature citing cases in market segments, including: electricity, telecommunications, automotive, and airlines. 

Some key examples include: 
*1992 United States airline price wars: American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and other United States carriers matched and exceeded the reduced prices of one another, resulting in increased sales volume but record losses.

*2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war: In 2020, Saudi Arabia initiated a price war on oil with Russia, which facilitated a 65% quarterly fall in the price of oil. Revenue from oil exports is heavily relied on by many governments, with Iraq, Kuwait, and the Republic of the Congo reporting oil rents (as a percentage of GDP) over 30%. Lower market prices led to reduced profit margins and put financial pressure on such governments.

<text>Mount Apo is the highest mountain peak in the Philippines, with an elevation of above sea level. A large solfataric, dormant stratovolcano, it is part of the Apo-Talomo Mountain Range of Mindanao island. Apo is situated on the tripartite border of Davao City, Davao del Sur, and Cotabato; its peak is visible from Davao City to the northeast, Digos to the southeast, and Bansalan to the west. Apo is a protected area and is the centerpiece of Mount Apo Natural Park.

==Geology==
Mount Apo is a flat-topped, (above sea level) high stratovolcano with three peaks. It is the highest peak of the Philippines. The southwest peak has the highest elevation and is topped by a wide crater that contains a small lake.

The volcanic history of Mount Apo is poorly known but eruptions have produced andesitic-to-dacitic lava. A line of solfataras extend from the southeast flank at an elevation of to the summit. Mount Apo is not known to have had historical eruptions, and was incorrectly attributed to be the source volcano of the 1641 eruption of Mount Melibengoy, also in Mindanao.

==Etymology and indigenous peoples==
&quot;&quot; is a title of respect meaning &quot;revered elder&quot; in various languages of the surrounding Lumad indigenous peoples. It is the shortened form of the original Manobo and Kalagan name Apo Sandawa (&quot;Elder Sandawa&quot; or &quot;Grandfather Sandawa&quot;), the name of the spirit of the mountain. Apo Sandawa is also regarded as an ancestor spirit by the various Manobo and Kalagan tribes living in the foothills, including the Obo, Manobo Bagobo, Manobo Apao, Tagabawa, Matigsalug, Ata, Arumanen, Tinananen, Kulamanen, Tagakaulo and Kagan peoples. The mountain itself is considered sacred grounds. Various rituals to Apo Sandawa are conducted by the supreme &quot;walyan&quot; (shaman) known as the &quot;diwata&quot;, who also serves as the medium for Apo Sandawa and the ancestor spirits of the Manobo and Kalagan tribes.

== Climate ==
The climate at the summit of Mount Apo is alpine (Köppen &quot;ETH&quot;) as its mean temperature does not exceed in any month. It falls under the Type IV climate under the modified corona&#x27;s classification wherein rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the year. Mean monthly temperature ranges from a low during January to during April. Monthly relative humidity ranges from 78% during March and April and 82% during June and July. Minima reach in January and February.

In late March–April 2016, due to the extreme effects of El Niño caused by climate change and global warming, massive patches of forest fires and bushfires appeared on the slopes of the mountain, causing hikers on the mountain to halt their ascent. Tourism in the region was threatened due to a massive haze engulfing the slopes of the mountain. The mountain later recovered after the government and local stakeholders initiated a holistic recovery plan for the entire natural park.

==Bodies of water==
=== Lakes ===
There are four major lakes in Mount Apo. Popular of these are Lake Agco, which used to be called &quot;The Blue Lake&quot;, and Lake Venado, a well-known mountaineers camping site and a stopover towards the peak. Lake Macadac and Lake Jordan are found in the summit grassland.

=== Rivers ===
Mount Apo has 19 major rivers and 21 creeks draining its 8 major watersheds (PASAlist.1992). Out of the 19 major rivers, only two has studies as reported by SEA-BMB consultants for the Mt. Apo Geothermal Project Environmental Impact Assessment 1991. According to the report, there are two river ecosystems draining the geothermal site namely: (1) Marbel-Matingao river ecosystem- characterized by narrower river channels at highly elevated areas, much faster water flow, clearer water and rock boulder-rich water beds. The aquatic organisms in the area have expectedly lower biological productivity and species diversity. The report also concluded that this river ecosystem provides much less economic and commercial value for its biological production. The study identified 12 species of fish caught in the area; (2) Kabacan River- Pulangi River ecosystem- characterized by a much wider channels at flat areas, relatively much slower water flow, highly turbid waters and sandy mud river beds.

Mount Apo is a headwaters catchment area of several major river systems like the Marbel, Matingaw, Kabacan, Pulangi, Sibulan, and Digos rivers.

=== Waterfalls ===
The Tudaya Falls is a one-tier waterfall in Mt. Apo Natural Park. This waterfall flows into the Sibulan River, which empties into the Davao Gulf.

==Flora and fauna==
The grasslands of Mount Apo are dominated by Cogon grass (&quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot;) and &quot;Saccharum spontaneum&quot;. Other grasses and ferns also thrive, especially along banks of creeks, streams, and rivers and on steep slopes.

Mount Apo is home to over 272 bird species, 111 of which are endemic to the area. It is also home to one of the world&#x27;s largest eagles, the critically endangered Philippine eagle, which is the country&#x27;s national bird.

==Energy==
===Geothermal energy===
The Mt. Apo 1 and Mt. Apo 2 geothermal plants, each possess a rated capacity of 54.24 megawatts. Owned and operated by Energy Development Corporation (EDC), the power plants were commissioned in February 1997 (Mt. Apo 1) and June 1999 (Mt. Apo 2) respectively, under a build-operate owner contract arrangement. Located in Barangay Ilomavis, Kidapawan City, North Cotabato is the &quot;Mindanao Geothermal Production Field&quot; with a power output of 108.48 MW, currently the only power plant of its kind in Mindanao.

The Philippine National Oil Company geothermal plant supplies electricity to Kidapawan and its neighboring provinces, its completion boosted the city&#x27;s economy.

===Hydroelectric plants===
==== The Tudaya Hydropower Plant ====
The Tudaya Hydropower Plant, located near the foot of Mount Apo on the Davao side (Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur), is composed of two run-of-river type plants that will contribute to the energy needs of Mindanao by early 2014.

==== The Sibulan Hydroelectric Power Plant ====
The Sibulan Hydroelectric Power Plants have been generating 42.5 MW of clean and renewable energy for Davao since 2010. It is also composed of two run-of the river mini hydro power plants.

Sibulan A was completed and commissioned on December 26, 2010. Local residents who are mainly engaged in abaca and fruit farming have since benefited from the use of of farm-to-market roads which were developed as access to the plants.

==Conservation==
===Mount Apo Natural Park===
On May 9, 1936, Mount Apo was declared a National Park with &quot;Proclamation No. 59&quot; by President Manuel L. Quezon followed by &quot;Proclamation No. 35&quot; of May 8, 1966, then &quot;Proclamation No. 882&quot; of September 24, 1996. On February 3, 2004, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo approved &quot;Republic Act No. 9237&quot;, which established Mount Apo as a protected area under the category of Natural Park with an area of ; with two peripheral areas of and as buffer zones, provided for its management and for other purposes.

===UNESCO World Heritage list===
In 1987, the National Geographic Society based in Washington, DC in the United States, published a book entitled, &quot;Our World&#x27;s Heritage&quot;, where Mount Apo was noted as a &#x27;site of World Heritage caliber&#x27;. The cover of the book also featured Mount Apo&#x27;s iconic Philippine eagle, along with three other heritage sites which have already been designated as &quot;UNESCO World Heritage Sites&quot;.

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) submitted Mount Apo on December 12, 2009, for inclusion in the UNESCO world heritage list. The mountain is considered by the DENR as the center of endemism in Mindanao. It has one of the highest land-based biological diversity in terms of flora and fauna per unit area. It has three distinct forest formations, from lowland tropical rainforest, to mid-mountain forests, and finally to high mountain forests.

In March 2015, Mount Apo was taken out from the UNESCO List of Tentative Sites due to the dramatic changes (such as logging, intrusion of companies and urban and agricultural landscape, exploitation, and poaching, among others) it experienced which does not constitute the UNESCO documents that describe the park. Better conservation and a change in the content of documents was recommended by UNESCO.

==Hiking activity==
At , Mount Apo is the highest mountain (peak) and volcano in the Philippines. It is one of the country&#x27;s most popular hiking/climbing destinations.

The first two attempts to reach Mt. Apo&#x27;s summit ended in failure: that of Jose Oyanguren (1852) and Señor Real (1870). The first recorded successful expedition was led by Don Joaquin Rajal on October 10, 1880. Prior to the climb, Rajal had to secure the permission of the Bagobo chieftain, Datu Manig. It is said that the Datu demanded that human sacrifice be made to please the god Mandarangan. But the datu agreed to waive this demand, and the climb commenced on October 6, 1880, succeeding five days later. Since then, numerous expeditions followed. These and more are described in colorful narrations by Fr. Miguel Bernad, S.J.

Several trails lead to the summit, coming from North Cotabato and Davao provinces. Arguably the easiest route to the Natural Park is through Kidapawan with an average hike taking 3–4 days roundtrip. In the classification system used by local popular mountaineering website PinoyMountaineer.com, the difficulty of the hike is 7 out of 9. Various sights along the trail include Lake Venado (the highest lake in the Philippines), the solfataras, and the old crater near its summit.

<doc id="256504" wikidata="Q3929977" url="?curid=256504" title="Ramón Ramos">
<text>Ramón Luis Ramos Manso (born November 20, 1967) is a Puerto Rican former basketball player. He began his career in the early 1980s with Indios de Canóvanas, then played college basketball at Seton Hall University. Ramos was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association in 1989, but would never play an NBA game after suffering severe injuries in a car crash.

==Career in Puerto Rico==
Born in the Puerto Rican municipality of Canóvanas, Ramos attended Catholic all-boys school Colegio San José, and played basketball and baseball. He began his basketball career in 1983 as a reserve center on now-defunct hometown team Indios de Canóvanas. He helped the Indios win back to back BSN league titles in 1983 and 1984. In 1987, Ramos played on the national under-21 team that won the gold medal at the &quot;Centrobasket Under 21&quot; competition after defeating Cuba 94–78 in Caguas. He played for Puerto Rico at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

==College and NBA career==
In 1985, Ramos relocated to the United States to attend Seton Hall University and played for the Pirates in the Big East Conference for all four years. He was selected to the All-Big East First Team and awarded the Big East&#x27;s Scholar athlete during the 1988–89 season and was named to the Big East All-Tournament First Team during the 1988 and 1989 NCAA tournaments. In his senior year, he averaged 11.9 points and 7.6 rebounds per game as Seton Hall reached their first and only Final Four in 1989, and progressed to the championship game. Ramos finished with nine points and five rebounds as the Pirates lost to the Michigan Wolverines 80–79 in overtime.

Ramos went undrafted in the 1989 NBA draft, and signed as a free agent during the 1989–90 preseason with the Portland Trail Blazers and was initially placed on the injured list due to tendinitis in his knee. He was promoted to the active roster shortly after being cleared to resume playing on December 5, filling the roster spot vacated by the waived Robert Reid. However, Ramos would never play in an NBA game, not leaving the bench for the next five games, and then having his career cut short eleven days later in a car crash.

==Accident==
On December 16, 1989, after a home game against the Golden State Warriors, Ramos lost control of the car he was driving on Portland&#x27;s Interstate 5 after hitting a patch of ice, causing him to cross the center median and flip several times. Ramos, who was not wearing a seatbelt and was thrown from the vehicle, suffered brain damage and remained in a coma for three months. Though alcohol was not a factor, Ramos had been speeding prior to the crash. The Blazers kept his locker space intact, complete with his game uniform, for the remainder of the 1989–90 season and several seasons to follow. He was paralyzed from the waist down for a year after the crash, while his speech was severely affected.

During the summer of 1991, more than 20,000 fans turned out to help the Trail Blazers raise $130,000 for a trust fund in Ramos&#x27;s name at Slam ‘N Jam, an outdoor basketball and music event in what is now Providence Park. Players from throughout the NBA came to play in the benefit game. Ramos and his parents were special guests and drew a long, standing ovation when they were introduced.

Ramos has difficulty walking and doing everyday things, and he requires constant supervision by his parents. His story has been shown several times on Puerto Rican and American television.

Ramos was inducted into the Seton Hall University Athletics Hall of Fame in February 2006. This marked Ramos&#x27;s first return to New Jersey since his graduation.

<doc id="256510" wikidata="Q46932" url="?curid=256510" title="Ismail Qemali">
<text>Ismail Qemali, or Ismail Kemal, (; 16 January 184426 January 1919), was an Albanian politician and statesman who is regarded as the founder of modern Albania. He served as the first prime minister of Albania from December 1912 until his resignation in January 1914.

Born in Vlorë to an Albanian noble family, Qemali developed an early interest in languages and later studied law in Istanbul. He travelled across Europe and returned to Albania after the Young Turk Revolution. He took part in the Congress of Ottoman Opposition. He played a major role in the Albanian revolt of 1912.

The principal author of the Declaration of Independence, Qemali was elected leader of the Provisional Government of Albania by the All-Albanian Congress in November 1912. He became prime minister and foreign minister of Albania. He died in exile in Italy in 1919.

== Early life ==

Ismail Qemali was born to an Albanian muslim family on 16 January 1844 in the city of Vlorë, then part of the Ottoman Empire. He completed his primary education in his hometown. Later he attended the Zosimaia School in Ioannina and graduated from Ottoman law school in Istanbul. Qemali married a Greek woman Kleoniki Sourmeli and sent his children to receive an education in Greece.

== Political career ==

Qemali embarked on a career as an Ottoman civil servant reaching high government positions in European and Asian parts of the empire after he moved to Istanbul in May 1860. He identified with the reform wing of Midhat Pasha, the author of the Constitution of the Ottoman Empire with whom Qemali was a close collaborator, and he became governor of several towns in the Balkans. During these years he took part in efforts for the standardization of the Albanian alphabet supporting the use of Latin characters for writing Albanian and the establishment of an Albanian cultural association.

By 1877, Qemali seemed to be on the brink of important functions in the Ottoman administration, but when Ottoman sultan Abdulhamid II () dismissed Midhat as prime minister, Ismail Qemali was sent into exile in western Anatolia, though the Sultan later recalled him and made him governor of Beirut. Qemali in 1892 presented the Sultan with a plan for a Balkan Confederation. It involved an entente between Balkan states and the empire eventually bound by mutual defense and economic development of resources agreements within a unified Great Eastern state with the Ottoman Empire as its centre and return of old borders. In this framework, Albania like North Macedonia was not treated as a separate state but as part of the Ottoman state. In time his liberal policy recommendations caused him to fall out of favour with the Sultan again. Qemali was aware that the empire came close to intervention from the Great Powers due to the Armenian crisis of 1895. Abdulhamid II awarded Qemali the position of governor (&quot;wali&quot;) of Tripoli, however he viewed the high post as exile.

=== Exile ===

In May 1900 Ismail Qemali boarded the British ambassador&#x27;s yacht, claimed asylum and was conveyed out of the empire where for the next eight years he lived in exile. Qemali left for Athens and issued proclamations explaining his abandonment of service to the empire while Ottoman authorities were upset with his flight. His interest toward the Albanian question was limited until these events and Qemali&#x27;s participation in the Albanian national movement was seen as an asset among Albanian circles who would bring prestige and influence Albanians Muslims to support the cause. He also worked to promote constitutional rule in the Ottoman Empire. 

In Paris he met Faik Konica and the two leaders worked together for a short time on Albanian issues through newspaper publications where Qemali called for Albanian unity, economic development, progress and to warn of future dangers of subjugation by Balkan states. The pair fell out as Qemali found Konica difficult to work with while Konica found his focus of being a politician overwhelming and disapproved of his pro-Greek policy. Qemali went on to found the newspaper &quot;Selamet&quot; (Salvation) published in Ottoman Turkish, Albanian and Greek which called for cooperation between Albanians and Greeks, due to both peoples having the same geopolitical interests. Some Albanian activists involved in the national movement considered those views as suspicious and an instrument of Greek policy causing his popularity to wane among Albanians.

At first Qemali made overtures to Austria-Hungary as the great power to assist Albanians in developing a more unified national opinion about their future, founding of more laic Albanian schools and cultivating their language and attaining autonomy. Later, he became close with Italo-Albanians, shifted his leanings toward Italy and supported Italian policy for Albania to counter Austro-Hungarian territorial ambitions in the Balkans. The Ottoman government initiated a crackdown of members and sympathisers of the Young Turk movement (CUP) with Qemali&#x27;s son Mahmud, a Council of State official being dismissed. 

Qemali in Paris participated in the Congress of Ottoman Opposition (1902) organised by Prince Mehmed Sabahaddin and backed his faction calling for reforms, minority rights, revolution and European intervention in the empire. The 1902 Congress resulted in no organisations being established in the Balkans and an unknown individual impersonating Qemali travelled to various cities in Bulgaria and succeeded in duping many Muslims. The aftermath of the 1902 Congress did result in the formation of the new central committee with attempts for the creation of a &quot;permanent committee&quot;, however Qemali and the Ottoman princes Sabahaddin and Lutfullah failed to get support from the Armenians. Later at a gathering of the permanent members of the new committee at the princes&#x27; house Qemali was installed as chairman. Control of the official CUP newspaper &quot;Osmanli&quot; was given by the old members of the central committee to Prince Sabahaddin and Qemali of the new central committee.
The new committee attempted to get Armenian endorsement through niceties about a lack of ethnic differences while Armenian organisations responded favorably toward figures like Qemali. Due to Qemali&#x27;s prominent role Albanians were targeted by the new committee through articles published in the newspaper &quot;Osmanli&quot; warning of partition by Balkan and Western countries of Albanian inhabited lands within the empire. These publications were distributed secretly in Albania through known associates such as Xhemil Vlora (Avlonyalı Cemil) who worked for Qemali. Qemali supported the leadership of the Albanian movement such as preparing appeals for Jup Kastrati or creating in Paris an Albanian Council. 

Journals supported by Qemali promoted Albanian autonomy, however the new committee failed to win support among Albanians to their side. Qemali along with the Ottoman princes compared themselves to the statesmen of the &quot;Tanzimat&quot; reform era. During this time Qemali&#x27;s positions swung between overthrow of the sultan and increasingly backing the Albanian national movement. He corresponded over Albania&#x27;s future with the Prince of Albanian origins, Albert Ghica who had designs on becoming an Albanian monarch and with Preng Doçi about the involvement of Qemali in an administrative role within a future autonomous Albania. Good relations were maintained with Ghica, while Dervish Hima an Albanian politically involved with the Romanian prince was viewed by Ottoman authorities as a pawn of Qemali.

=== Plot against the sultan ===

Between 1902 and 1903 a coup de detat plot to overthrow Abdulhamid II was devised by the CUP. Involved were Colonel Shevket Bey and Rexhep Pasha Mati (Recep Pasha) left in charge of organising the military aspects of the plan along with Qemali and Prince Sabaheddin given the task of getting diplomatic and financial support and to buy two ships for the venture. Qemali&#x27;s task was the most difficult aspect of the plot, he kept a unit in Paris, commenced political activities as a high ranking politician in exile and made many visits to London which annoyed the Ottoman government as they were unable to work out his real aims.

Ottoman authorities paid close attention and in some cases court martialed people they thought were associated with Qemali in attempts that were unsuccessful to find out his intentions. In Paris Qemali established close contacts and good relations with journalists such as Stéphane Lauzanne and William Morton Fullerton. During July 1902, Qemali went to London to get British support for the plot and corresponded with and visited people in the British government such as Edmund Monson and Thomas Sanderson. He received responses from the Foreign Office, however Qemali exaggerated the level of British support, being only moral support and ambiguous for the venture. Qemali interactions with the British had managed to raise his profile and notability while he also discussed with them the Ottoman exile of his son to Bitlis. The British were aware of the activities of Qemali and his associates.

Qemali also corresponded with London-based Ottoman diplomats on the plan like Reşid Sadi who secretly worked for the Young Turks. Attempts by Qemali were made to convince Lord Cromer that the &quot;Turkish question&quot; was a pressing matter and he agreed with those sentiments and promised to reply to the Foreign office. He also secretly met Abbas II of Egypt () in an attempt to secure funds and the khedive placed £4000 in an English bank for the plot, yet later misgivings about Qemali made the Egyptian leader halt funds and fearing scandal he relented. 

An Albanian confidant Xhafer Berxhani from Greece was sent by Qemali to see Rexhep Pasha in Tripoli, Ottoman Libya. Eqrem Vlora, a member of the Vlora family stated that during this time Rexhep Pasha sent £1000 in gold to Qemali and assisted his son Tahir Pasha in exile at Tripoli to escape to Europe. At the end of January 1903, Qemali came back to Paris and found the princes grieving the death of their father Damad Mahmud Pasha, yet they all proceeded to London to make financial arrangements for the plot. Later Qemali and the princes worked to finalise details of their plan. Qemali having the details of tonnage and dimensions left for Athens with £4000 to buy two ships.

While there Qemali was disappointed with the procurement process for the ships and the delay made the central committee members go to Athens. Reşid Sadi arrived and found there was no large ships and that Qemali was residing at the house of an aide-de-camp to the Greek monarch. Qemali informed Reşid Sadi that he was duped and that in Greece it was difficult to find suitable ships. Later Sabaheddin traveled to see the khedive and failed to procure funds and ships where later he returned to Athens and for the last time met with Qemali, Reşid Sadi and Vasileos Musurus Ghikis. Qemali wanted to travel to Naples and get ships from there, however the others decided to abandon the plot. 

The failure of the plan was put down to different reasons with Qemali blaming prolonged negotiations about obtaining ships, while Rexhep Pasha viewed Qemali&#x27;s lukewarm attitude for the venture as reason to change his mind. From within Sabaheddin&#x27;s inner circle the view was that Qemali took the money to profit for his own purposes. Those sentiments were shared by people such as Haydar Midhat who quit the new central committee after he learned that Qemali worked for Greek interests in Albania and was on their payroll. After the 1908 Young Turk revolution some people who opposed the CUP made allegations against Qemali of being uninterested in the plot, worked for his interests and a &quot;crook&quot; that took money from the prince. Qemali broke ties with the Young Turks and on 16 August 1903 he gave an interview to an Italian newspaper in his role as an &quot;Albanian patriot&quot; and pursued his new preoccupation with Albania&#x27;s future.

=== Albanian cause ===

In January 1907 a secret agreement was signed between Qemali and the Greek government which concerned the possibility of an alliance against the Ottoman Empire. There is not much information about the meeting but some sources state that the two sides agreed that the future Greek-Albanian boundary should be located on the Ceraunian Mountains with no Albanian armed activity in the area in exchange for Greek backing of Albanian independence. This was not widely accepted by Albanian nationalists and patriots. The CUP severely criticised Qemali for the agreement with the Greeks. 

In Rome July 1907, Qemali gave a lengthy interview to Italian media where he called for cooperation between Balkan peoples, a &quot;Greco-Albanian entente&quot; and affirmed Albania as having its own language, literature, history and traditions and a right to liberty and independence. He was also against Albanian cooperation with Bulgarian Macedonians and viewed their support of Albanian insurrectionists as self-serving and strengthening their movement due to depletion of Albanian forces. Qemali&#x27;s reasons for closer ties with Greeks during this time was to gain support for Albanian independence and thwart Bulgarian ambitions in the wider Balkans region as he viewed them as a threat to Greece and northern Albania in Macedonia along with Austro-Hungarian territorial ambitions.

Throughout this time Qemali living abroad was not the leader of the Albanian national movement, due to his strong pro-British and pro-Greek position. As an Albanian leader the CUP was hostile toward Qemali and the organisation shunned him due to his secret understanding with the Greeks to partition the western regions of the Balkan provinces of the empire. During his lifetime Qemali looked upon Greek culture with favour and respect, maintained friendly relations with Greeks and promoted cooperation between them and Albanians. He promoted a diplomatic solution for creating an independent Albania, an approach rejected by some Albanian groups of the era that instead favoured guerilla warfare against the empire. Qemali may have favoured intervention by the Great Powers into Albanian affairs and those were accusations made against him by a minority of opponents. Over time however he became an Albanian nationalist and by 1912 would declare the independence of Albania.

=== Young Turk Revolution and countercoup ===

During the events of the Young Turk Revolution (1908), rumors of the time had it that Abdulhamid II as a last resort asked Qemali for assistance and his response was that only the restoration of the Ottoman constitution would pacify the Albanians. After the 1908 revolution and constitutional restoration Qemali returned from exile and became a deputy representing Berat in the restored Ottoman Parliament, working with liberal politicians and the British. He contributed to the Young Turk (CUP) newspaper &quot;Tanin&quot; where Qemali called for government reforms. Qemali became leader of the Albanian deputies in the Ottoman parliament and did not oppose Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia adding that recognition of the move should entail security guarantees for the empire in case of war with Balkan states over territory.

During the 31 March incident, the leadership of the Liberty Party (&quot;Ahrar&quot;) attempted unsuccessfully to get control over events and stop the rebellion from turning toward a reactionary pro-sultan and anti-constitutional course. Qemali, an Ahrar deputy managed to get some parliamentarians to attend parliament, they accepted the requests of the mutineering troops and made an official announcement that the constitution and sharia would be kept. Uninvolved in the events of the initial countercoup Qemali was briefly made President of the Ottoman National Assembly and led it to recognise a new government by Abdulhamid II. Qemali wired his constituency in Vlorë telling them to acknowledge the new government and Albanians from his hometown backed him with some raiding the arms depot to support the sultan with weapons if the situation called for it. Qemali left the city prior to the CUP Action Army arriving at Istanbul to suppress the rebellion and he fled to Greece. A government investigation later cleared Qemali of any wrongdoing.

=== Nationalism ===

His political career thereafter concentrated solely on Albanian nationalism. Increasing guerilla activity in Southern Albania led to Qemali coming under suspicion from the Ottoman government during the summer months of 1909. The Athens embassy of the Ottoman Empire reported that Qemali negotiated with organization financed by wealthy Albanian Tosks and Greece about forging a union. Qemali returned from Athens to Istanbul after the parliament cleared him from involvement in the counter-revolutionary movement and he became leader of a group of &quot;modern liberals&quot; who were former members of the Ahrar party. In 1910 Qemali in statements to the Austro-Hungarian ambassador criticized the Young Turk government for promoting Turks above other nationalities in the empire and their divide and rule policies regarding Albanians.

During the Albanian revolt of 1911 he traveled with Xhemal Bey of Tirana and joined leaders of the revolt at a meeting in Gerče, a village in Montenegro on 23 June. Together they drew up the &quot;Greçë Memorandum&quot; that called for Albanian autonomy, schooling and language rights, recognition of Albanians, electoral freedoms and liberty, military service in Albania and other measures which addressed their requests both to Ottoman Empire and Europe (in particular to the Great Britain). In December 1911, Qemali and Hasan Prishtina convened secret meetings of Albanian political notables in Istanbul that decided to organise a future Albanian uprising. 

Qemali was given the task of going to Europe to obtain support from sympathetic governments for the Albanian movement in addition to financial support and funds for buying 15,000 guns. He met with Austro-Hungarian officials in Paris and expressed that his previous misgivings regarding them had shifted, viewed Austria-Hungary as the only defender of Albania and could rely on Albanian support if they backed Albanian geopolitical interests within a strong Ottoman state. With Prishtina he took the initiative to organize the Taksim meeting for the organization of the Albanian revolt of 1912. During the debates which involved the revolt, Qemali was part of the leadership faction that backed and advocated for Albanian autonomy within the empire during negotiations with the Ottomans.

=== Independence of Albania ===

The Balkan Wars marked the end of Ottoman rule in the region. In September 1912, Qemali along with Luigj Gurakuqi traveled to Bucharest to consult with the Albanian community in Romania. Later he departed for Vienna and kept in touch through telegram with Austro-Hungarian officials and supported as a solution their intervention in Albania. On 12 November Qemali met with officials from the Austro-Hungarian foreign ministry and they told him of their sympathies for the Albanians and their situation but could not do much due to the continuing war. Foreign Minister Leopold Berchtold supported Qemali&#x27;s views on the Albanian question and placed a boat at his disposal. From Trieste, Qemali sailed to Durrës by mid November, however his stay was short due to Ottoman authorities objecting to his presence with Serb forces approaching the city and he left for Vlorë arriving there on 26 November. Meanwhile, his son Ethem had summoned Albanian representatives to Vlorë from all over Albania.

Qemali was the principal figure in the secession of Albania from the Ottoman Empire, in the Albanian Declaration of Independence and the formation of the independent Albania on 28 November 1912. This signaled the end of more than 400 years of Ottoman rule in Albania. Together with Gurakuqi, he raised the Albanian flag on the balcony of the two-story building in Vlorë where the Declaration of Independence had just been signed.

== Prime minister ==

The establishment of the government was postponed for the fourth session of the Assembly of Vlorë, held on 4 December 1912, until representatives of all regions of Albania arrived to Vlorë. The Ottoman Council of Ministers opposed his actions preferring Albanian autonomy and requested that Qemali give military assistance to the Ottoman Third Army trapped in southern Albania. Aware of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, Qemali asked the Great Powers to recognise and support an independent Albania.

The Ottoman CUP government sought to restore its control over Albania and sent lieutenant colonel Bekir Fikri in 1913 to raise Albanian support for Ahmed Izzet Pasha, an Albanian Ottoman officer and CUP member as the candidate for the Albanian throne. Fikri acting as Izzet Pasha&#x27;s emissary contacted Qemali and presented him with a plan that envisaged joint Ottoman, Albanian and Bulgarian military action against Greece and Serbia. Albania&#x27;s reward in the military venture would have been the allocation of Kosovo and Chameria, areas given to Serbia and Greece by the Conference of Ambassadors. 

Qemali assured Fikri of his loyalty to Izzet as monarch of Albania and supported a plan from the CUP government in Istanbul to secretly infiltrate troops and weapons into the country to conduct a guerilla war against Serbian and Greek forces. After these negotiations Fikri sent telegrams to Istanbul, and asked the government to send ammunition, weapons and soldiers. The Serbs uncovered the plot and reported the operation to the International Control Commission (ICC). The ICC, an organisation temporarily administering Albania on behalf of the Great Powers allowed their Dutch officers serving as the Albanian Gendarmerie to declare a state of emergency and stop the plot. They raided Vlorë on 7–8 January 1914, discovering more than 200 Ottoman troops and arrested Fikri. During Fikri&#x27;s trial the plot emerged and an ICC military court under Colonel Willem de Veer condemned him to death and later commuted to life imprisonment, while Qemali and his cabinet resigned. After Qemali left the country, turmoil ensued throughout Albania.
== Exile and death ==
During the First World War (1914–1918), Qemali lived in exile in Paris, where, though short of funds, he maintained a wide range of contacts and collaborated with the correspondent of the continental edition of the British newspaper Daily Mail, Somerville Story, to write his memoirs. His autobiography, published after his death, is the only memoir of a late Ottoman statesman to be written in English and is a unique record of a liberal, multicultural approach to the problems of the dying empire. In 1918, Qemali travelled to Italy to promote support for his movement in Albania, but was prevented by the Italian government from leaving Italy and remained as its involuntary guest at a hotel in Perugia, much to his irritation. He died of an apparent heart attack on 26 January 1919. After his death, his body was brought to Vlorë and buried in the local tekke of the Bektashi Order.

== Reception and legacy ==
Ismail Qemali is commemorated in Albania as their (&quot;Father of the Nation&quot;). He is depicted on the obverses of the Albanian 200 lekë banknote of 1992–1996, and of the 500 lekë banknote issued since 1996. On 27 June 2012, Albanian president Bamir Topi decorated Qemali with the Order of the National Flag (post-mortem).

<text>The bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus) is a small, long-tailed passerine bird found in reed beds near water in the temperate zone of Eurasia. It is frequently known as the bearded tit or the bearded parrotbill, as it historically was believed to be closely related to tits or parrotbills. Today it is known to lack close relatives and it is the only species in the family Panuridae.

Bearded reedlings are strongly sexually dimorphic and form life-long pairs. They are highly productive and can breed several times in a season. They mainly feed on small invertebrates in summer and plant seeds in winter.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The bearded reedling was scientifically described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the tits in the genus &quot;Parus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Parus biarmicus&quot;. Linnaeus based his entry on the &quot;beardmanica or bearded tit-mouse&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1731 by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin and the &quot;least butcher-bird&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1747 by George Edwards. The bearded reedling was later moved from the tit family and placed with the parrotbills in the family Paradoxornithidae. Subsequent authors variously classified the species as a member of Muscicapidae (Old World flycatchers), Sylviidae (typical warblers) or Timaliidae (Old World babbler). Molecular phylogenetic studies show that it is a unique passerine, not part of any of these families. The bearded reedling is now placed in the monotypic family Panuridae that was introduced in 1860 (as the subfamily Panurinae) by Marc Athanase Parfait Œillet Des Murs. It lacks close relatives, but it is a sylvioid and nearest to the lark family Alaudidae. Panuridae and Alaudidae split from each other in the Early Miocene.

The current genus name, &quot;Panurus&quot;, was introduced by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1816. It is from Ancient Greek &quot;panu&quot;, &quot;exceedingly&quot;, and &quot;ουρά&quot;, &quot;tail&quot;. The specific &quot;biarmicus&quot; is from &quot;Biarmia&quot;, a Latinised form of Bjarmaland, today part of Russia&#x27;s Arkhangelsk Oblast and Kola Peninsula (a result of confusion when the species was first described; the bearded reedling does not range into these areas).

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies are generally recognised:

* &quot;P. b. biarmicus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – medium-dark in colour and found in northern, western and southern Europe, also ranging into Turkey and Azerbaijan
* &quot;P. b. russicus&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1831) – pale and found in eastern Europe, through southern Russia and Central Asia to Mongolia and northern China
* &quot;P. b. kosswigi&quot; Kumerloeve, 1959 – dark and found in Hatay Province of southern Turkey and most likely in adjacent Syria

In some parts of central and eastern Europe, it is not entirely certain if &quot;P. b. biarmicus&quot;, &quot;P. b. russicus&quot; or intermediates are present. The three subspecies are quite similar; some authorities have suggested that the species should be considered monotypic (i.e. no distinct subspecies) because of the amount of individual variation and overall cline in the variation.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The bearded reedling is native to temperate Europe and Asia, ranging from Spain, France and the British Isles to the Manchurian region, but its distribution tends to be quite spotty because of its habitat preference. Maps often show most of its Asian range as a single large continuous section (instead of more spotty), but this is due to limited details in monitoring data from this area relative to the western part of its range. In Europe, it used to be limited to mid and low latitudes, also including Great Britain, but in the second half of the 20th century it has expanded north into Scandinavia, Finland and the northern Baltics.

It is an occasional non-breeding visitor to Cyprus and Iran, and it has rarely been recorded as a vagrant to the west, south and east of its normal distribution in Portugal, North Africa, Israel, Kuwait, Pakistan, Japan and Korea. The species generally is resident and no population is known to follow a clear and consistent migration pattern. However, some European populations tend to spend the non-breeding period (winter) to the south or southwest of their breeding (summer) range, making what potentially can be described as a short-distance migration, up to a few hundred kilometres long. This is primarily seen in the northern half of the continent, but in no region does it appear to involve the entire population, with some birds partaking in such movements and some essentially staying year-round. Both adults and young may make eruptive dispersals outside the breeding season and in periods with limited food or cold weather bearded reedlings may perform other, most often local movements.

The bearded reedling is a habitat specialist found in reed beds, primarily those with common reed, by fresh or brackish water lakes, swamps or rivers, but it also occurs in nearby tall grass-like vegetation such as bulrushes and true sedges. Especially during the breeding period the species quite strongly avoids non-floodable or dry parts of wetlands, but in other times it may wander more freely. Although typically found perched or climbing on reeds and similar types of vegetation, it readily hops on the ground, especially in swampy places or at water&#x27;s edge. It has a wide altitudinal range, mostly being found from sea level to medium altitudes, but has been recorded up to above sea level in China.

==Appearance and voice==

This is a small bird, in length, with a long tail and an undulating flight. The plumage is mostly orange-brown, with a whitish throat and chest, some contrasting black and white parts in the wings, and white edges to the tail feathers. The adult male has a grey head, black &quot;moustaches&quot; (not a beard) and black undertail coverts. The adult female is generally paler, with a more brownish head and no black moustaches or undertail coverts, but sometimes with black streaks/spots to the crown or back. Whereas these streaks/spots vary from absent to strong in the west of the species&#x27; range, they are absent to faint in the east. There is a single reported case of a gynandromorph bearded reedling where one side of the bird showed mainly male plumage characteristics and the other side female characteristics. The adult female&#x27;s bill is often somewhat duller that the adult male&#x27;s bright orange-yellow bill. Adults go through a single complete moult in the late summer–autumn, generally starting in August (just after the breeding season) and being finished around 50 days later.

Juveniles of both sexes resemble the adult female, but are overall buffier in colour, have a roughly rectangular black patch on the back (well beyond the streaks/spots on the backs of even the most strongly marked adult females) and extensive black to the tail feathers. The juvenile male has a relatively large and contrasting black loreal patch and a bright orange-yellow bill, whereas the juvenile female has a smaller dusky-grey loreal patch and a blackish, brownish or yellowish-dusky bill. This sex-related difference in juvenile bill colour is already evident at the late nestling stage. Unlike most birds, bearded reedlings undergo a complete post-juvenile moult, starting in late July–early September and ending with an adult plumage in October. This means that bearded reedlings hatched only a few months earlier already are indistinguishable from older adults by the autumn. When first fledged, juveniles have dark brown eyes, which then become grey and later grey-yellow or yellow. Once they have moulted into the adult plumage they also generally have the adult yellow or orange eye colour; however bearded reedlings in adult plumage with juvenile-like brown or grey eyes occur on occasion.

Because of their well-camouflaged plumage and dense reed bed habitat, they are easily overlooked, but their presence is often revealed by their characteristic metallic &quot;ping&quot; call, which is used by bearded reedlings to maintain contact with each other. The male&#x27;s song has been described as a tuneful &quot;tschin-schik-schra&quot;. During flight, their short wings give a whirring sound.

==Behavior==
===Life cycle===
The bearded reedling is social and during the non-breeding season it is usually seen in groups of up to a few tens of birds, exceptionally up to two hundred. During the breeding season, it is most commonly seen in pairs, family groups or groups of independent young.

Young already form pairs when still juvenile, only a few weeks after having fledged. Once formed, a pairing is generally life-long and they stay together throughout the year, also sleeping closely together. If one part of a pair dies, the surviving bird may join groups of young to find a new partner to pair up with. A pair is monogamous, although mating with another partner (infidelity) is not uncommon for either sex. The length of a male&#x27;s black &quot;moustaches&quot; is an honest signal indicating his dominance (in competitions for food between males the one with the longest &quot;moustaches&quot; usually wins) and females prefer males where it is longer. Both sexes, but especially females, also prefer partners with longer tails and tail length plays a role in a bird&#x27;s movement agility. In juveniles of both sexes, the size of the loreal patch is an honest signal of body condition, but whether this plays a role in mate choice when pairs are first established is unknown.

Breeding happens in the spring and summer, from late March to early September, but how early it starts and late it ends depends on environmental conditions and availability of food, and April to July is common. There are typically two or three, less frequently four and rarely five, broods in a season. In captivity where not limited by the same conditions as in the wild, they may already begin to breed in late February and exceptionally there can be attempts of up to seven broods in a season, although it is doubtful that this many can be raised successfully. A pair may nest alone or as part of a small loose colony that on average consists of six pairs with nests located a few metres apart. Infidelity is common in those nesting in loose colonies and rare in pairs nesting alone. It frequently happens when a female performs a &quot;catch-me-if-you-can&quot; behavior, initiated by her making a specific call that attracts males, then flies up with males in pursuit, finally diving down to the reed bed and allowing the fastest male to mate with her. The winner can be her own male partner or a male paired with another female, but unpaired males are generally unlikely to mate at all. Mating is very frequent and to increase the chance of fathering a clutch the male bearded reedling has a relatively large and muscular cloacal protuberance that functions as a copulatory organ, which is unique among passerines. In the wild bearded reedlings are entirely non-territorial, but those living under the more restricted space of captivity may show some territorial tendencies, though two pairs can still inhabit and breed in an aviary that covers a couple of square meters.

Both sexes participate in the building of the cup-shaped nest, which has a diameter of between . It is attached to reeds or similar vegetation and can be positioned from almost ground or water level to a height of about . Artificial nests are also accepted. Both sexes participate in the up to two week long incubation of the 3 to 11 (usually 4 to 8) eggs, which is followed by another up to about two week long nestling period. After having left the nest, which frequently happens before being able to fly, the young continue to rely on the parents for up to about a two weeks, rarely more. With a typical nest building period of five days, the average time from start of building a nest to young being fully independent is about forty days. Especially in years with a low population density, a pair may start a new brood in a nearby new nest even before their previous has left their nest. When there are overlapping broods, the female devotes her time to the new brood and the male divides his time between the old and the new. During successful years, a pair is likely to have the highest number of young in a season of any European passerine. Young rapidly reach sexual maturity and those hatched early in a season can potentially breed late in the same season, but this is exceptional (it has not been confirmed from bearded reedlings in the wild) and first breeding usually only happens next year.

On average bearded reedlings reach an age of two or three years, but the record is seven years and three months.

===Feeding===
In the summer, the bearded reedling mostly eats adult insects, their larvae and pupae, and other small invertebrates (springtails, spiders, snails, etc), typically taking rather slow-moving species. This is also the food a pair provides to their nestlings and fledglings. It is common for a nest site to be several hundred metres from the main feeding sites.

In the late autumn and winter, bearded reedlings mostly feed on seeds of common reed, rushes, common nettle, great willowherb and other grassy or sedge-like plants, occasionally forming mixed flocks with other small seed-eating birds like redpolls. Seeds are taken directly from the plant or from the ground, scratching the surface, turning over leaves or even probing into snow. However, during hard or wet winters, access to this important food source can be greatly reduced due to extensive snow cover, ice cover or floods, causing starvation. Significant changes happen in its digestive system to cope with the very different summer and winter diets. The stomach lining is strengthened, and from around September to December, bearded reedlings swallow gritting material, for example coarse sand or small gravel grains, which aids in grinding down the tough seeds.

==Conservation status==
Overall the bearded reedling is widespread with a large population and it is not considered threatened. In Europe alone it is estimated that there are around 500,000 or more adults and the vast majority of the species&#x27; range is in Asia, meaning that the total adult population is presumed to be at least 3,000,000. However, due to its lifestyle, getting accurate population estimates is difficult, even for those living in well-studied parts of the world.

Local populations fluctuate greatly from year to year depending on availability of food and habitat. The bearded reedling is vulnerable to hard winters during which many birds may die; even after a complete die-off in a region the species&#x27; high breeding capacity and eruptive dispersal behavior allows it to later be recolonised from other regions. In certain places, habitat loss has caused populations to fall or even disappear entirely. The subspecies &quot;P. b. kosswigi&quot;, which is only definitely known from the today fully drained Lake Amik (although it may also occur elsewhere in this part of Turkey and in adjacent Syria), has not been recorded since 1962 and could be extinct.

The eruptive dispersal behavior of the bearded reedling has allowed it to expand its range into new regions. For example, it first established itself as a breeder in Denmark and Sweden in the late 1960s and is now locally fairly common in both countries (but subject to large annual variations depending on severity of winters). This was part of an overall expansion in northwestern Europe during the 1960s, which appears to mainly have been driven by eruptive dispersals from the large population in the Netherlands. In subsequent decades, the species has further expanded into northern Europe, with the first record in Estonia in 1978 and breeding being verified shortly after, and it becoming established as a breeder in Finland in the late 1980s. With global warming, it is likely that further expansions will occur in regions where winters are becoming milder. Conversely, the predicted increase in extreme weather events, especially droughts or winter floods, is likely to have a negative effect on some populations of the bearded reedling.

===In the United Kingdom and Ireland===
The population has always fluctuated greatly depending mainly on the severity of winters and the availability of suitable reed beds, which commonly were harvested or drained, but collection of their eggs also played a role.

Up to the early 20th century, the bearded reedling had experienced a period of decline due to habitat loss and persecution. After a series of hard winters in the 1930s and 40s, the remaining population had crashed with a small number of birds surviving in a few locations in southeastern England. In the last of these, the severe 1946–47 winter, the species was almost exterminated and in the following summer there were at most around half a dozen pairs in Norfolk and Suffolk. Subsequently, the bearded reedling&#x27;s population began to increase and it was speculated that this in part relied on influx from the European mainland; its ability to cross the English Channel was first confirmed in 1965 when several individuals ringed in the Netherlands were found in Great Britain (part of a larger expansion in northwestern Europe from the Netherlands in the 1960s). Since then the British population has significantly increased in both range and numbers, but it remains overall uncommon and quite local. There have been a few later population crashes, probably related to hard winters, including one reduction that happened over several years from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, one over the winter of 2010–11 and one over the winter of 2017–18 (likely due to the February–March cold wave), but none were anywhere near as drastic as the reduction seen in the 1930s–40s and recoveries have been fast.

As of 2019, the vast majority of the United Kingdom&#x27;s almost 100 known breeding sites are in England, which is home to more than 500 pairs. These are mainly confined to southern and eastern parts of England, but there are also a few sites in the North West. In Scotland there are only three known breeding sites, all in the east, but this includes the largest in the United Kingdom at the mouth of the River Tay in Perth and Kinross, where the species first established itself in the early 1990s but today there are possibly in excess of 250 pairs (the two other Scottish sites are small and irregular). After having again disappeared from Wales as a breeding bird in the early 1980s, it was first confirmed to have returned in 2005 in Gwent and this remains the only place where it is known to breed.

In Ireland, the bearded reedling has historically been considered a rare accidental visitor, but in recent decades there have been confirmed cases of breeding in coastal southeastern parts of the island. There has been a very small breeding population in County Wexford since 2011 (where not known to have bred earlier) and likely in County Wicklow since 2017 (first known Irish breeding was in this county in 1976 and bred again in 1982–85).

<text>The tamaraw or Mindoro dwarf buffalo (Bubalus mindorensis) is a small buffalo belonging to the family Bovidae. It is endemic to the island of Mindoro in the Philippines, and is the only endemic Philippine bovine. It is believed, however, to have once also thrived on the larger island of Luzon. The tamaraw was originally found all over Mindoro, from sea level up to the mountains (2000 m above sea level), but because of human habitation, hunting, and logging, it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now a critically endangered species.

Contrary to common belief and past classification, the tamaraw is not a subspecies of the water buffalo, nor is it a subspecies of the slightly larger carabao, which is classified as a subspecies of the water buffalo. In contrast to the carabao, the tamaraw has a number of distinguishing characteristics; it is slightly hairier, has light markings on its face, is not gregarious, and has shorter horns that are somewhat V-shaped. It is the second-largest native terrestrial mammal in the country, next only to the carabao.

==Evolutionary history==
The presence of &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; on the island of Mindoro, coupled with the discovery of fossil bubalids in other islands around the archipelago, indicates that the family was once widespread throughout the Philippines. In fact, fossil finds in the 20th century have shown that &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; was once found on the northern Philippine island of Luzon during the Pleistocene.

As a member of the family Bovidae, the tamaraw&#x27;s close affinity to the water buffalo (&quot;B. bubalis&quot;) has been validated many times in the past. It was once considered a subspecies of &quot;B. bubalis&quot; (as &quot;Anoa bubalis&quot;), &quot;Anoa bubalis mindorensis&quot;. Recent genetic analysis studies of the family members further strengthen this view.

===Etymology and taxonomic history===
The tamaraw was originally described as &quot;Anoa mindorensis&quot; by French zoologist Pierre Marie Heude in 1888. In 1958, it was described as &quot;Anoa bubalis mindorensis&quot;, a subspecies of the then-water buffalo species (&quot;Anoa bubalis&quot;). A little over a decade after, the tamaraw was elevated to species status as &quot;Anoa mindorensis&quot; in 1969.

Later research and analyses of relationships determined the genus &quot;Anoa&quot; to be a part of the genus &quot;Bubalus&quot;. The tamaraw&#x27;s scientific name was updated into its present form, &quot;Bubalus mindorensis&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Bubalus &quot;(&quot;Bubalus&quot;)&quot; mindorensis&quot;).

The name tamaraw has other variants, such as tamarau, tamarou, and tamarao. The term tamaraw may have come from &quot;tamadaw&quot;, which is a probable alternative name for the banteng (&quot;Bos javanicus&quot;).

===Anatomy and morphology===
&quot;B. mindorensis&quot; has the appearance of a typical member of its family. It has a compact, heavyset, bovine body, four legs that end in cloven hooves, and a small, horned head at the end of a short neck. It is smaller and stockier compared to the water buffalo (&quot;B. bubalis&quot;). Little sexual dimorphism is seen in the species, although males are reported to have thicker necks. The tamaraw has a typical shoulder height of . The length of the body is , while the tail adds a further . Reported weights have ranged from .

Adults have a dark brown to grayish color and more hair than &quot;B. bubalis&quot;. The limbs are short and stocky. White markings are seen in the hooves and the inner lower fore legs. These markings are similar to those of the anoa (&quot;B. depressicornis&quot;). The face is the same color as the body. Most of the members of the species also have a pair of gray-white strips that begins from the inner corner of the eye to the horns. The nose and lips have black skin. The ears are long from notch to tip with white markings on the insides.

Both sexes grows short, black horns in a V-shaped manner compared to C-shaped horns of &quot;B. bubalis&quot;. The horns have flat surfaces and are triangular at their base. Due to the regular rubbing, the tamaraw&#x27;s horns have a worn outer surface, but with rough inner sides. The horns are reported to be long.
==Distribution==

The tamaraw was first documented in 1888 on the island of Mindoro. Before 1900, most people avoided settling on Mindoro due to a virulent strain of malaria. However, as antimalarial medicine was developed, more people settled on the island. The increase in human activity has drastically reduced tamaraw population. By 1966, the tamaraw&#x27;s range was reduced to three areas: Mount Iglit, Mount Calavite, and areas near the Sablayan Penal Settlement. By 2000, their range was further reduced to only two areas: the Mounts Iglit–Baco National Park and Aruyan.

Initial estimates of the &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; population on Mindoro was placed at around 10,000 individuals in the early 1900s. Less than 50 years later in 1949, the population had dwindled to around 1000 individuals. By 1953, fewer than 250 animals were estimated to be alive. These population estimates continually grew smaller until the International Union for Conservation of Nature publication of their 1969 Red Data Book, where the tamaraw population was noted to be an alarmingly low 100 head. This head count rose to 120 animals in 1975. Current estimates place the wild tamaraw population from 30 to 200 individuals.

==Ecology and life history==

As a rare, endemic mammal on a relatively secluded island, the ecology of the tamaraw is largely unknown. Individuals of the species are reclusive and shy away from humans. In addition, the small sizes of the species&#x27; subpopulations, already spread thin throughout their fragmented range (in 1986, about 51 individuals were found in a 20-km2 area), make contact with any more than a solitary individual a rarity.

===Habitat===
&quot;B. mindorensis&quot; prefers tropical highland forested areas. It is typically found in thick brush, near open-canopied glades, where it may feed on grasses. Since human habitation and subsequent forest fragmentation of their home island of Mindoro, the habitat preferences of the tamaraw have somewhat expanded to lower-altitude grassy plains. Within their mountainous environment, tamaraws will usually be found not far from sources of water. 

===Trophic ecology===
The tamaraw is a grazer that feeds on grasses and young bamboo shoots, although it is known to prefer cogon grass and wild sugarcane (&quot;Saccharum spontaneum&quot;). They are naturally diurnal, feeding during the daytime hours; however, daytime human activities have recently forced select &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; individuals to be nocturnal to avoid human contact.

===Life history===
The tamaraw is known to live for about 20 years, with an estimated lifespan of about 25. The adult female tamaraw gives birth to one offspring after a gestation period around 300 days. There is an interbirth interval of two years, although one female has been sighted with three juveniles. The calf stays for 2–4 years with its mother before becoming independent.

==Behavioral ecology==

Unlike the closely related water buffalo, &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; is a solitary creature. Adults of the species do not occur in herds or smaller packs, and are often encountered alone. Only juveniles exhibit the typical bovine herding behavior and clan hierarchy often seen in water buffalo. Males and females are known to associate all year round, but this interaction lasts only a few hours. This solitary behavior may be an adaptation to its forest environment. Adult males are often solitary and apparently aggressive, while adult females can be alone, accompanied by a bull, or their young of different ages.

Similar to other bovines the tamaraw wallows in mud pits, maybe to avoid biting insects.

Reports of aggression when cornered are unsubstantiated. Tamaraw threat posture involves lowering the head, and shifting its horns into a vertical position, accompanied by head shaking.

==Conservation==

Being an entirely endemic and rare land mammal, &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; stands as an extremely vulnerable species. Currently, it is classified as a critically endangered species and has been so since 2000 by the IUCN on its IUCN Red List of endangered species. Awareness of the conservation status of &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; began in 1965, when it was classified as status inadequately known by the IUCN. Enough data were gathered on the tamaraw population by 1986, and the IUCN conservation monitoring center declared the species endangered. Throughout succeeding surveys conducted in 1988, 1990, 1994 and 1996, the species remained listed on the Red List as &quot;endangered&quot;. The relisting of the species in 1996 fulfilled the IUCN criteria &quot;B1+2c&quot; and &quot;D1&quot;. Criterion &quot;B1&quot; indicated that the species&#x27; range was less than 500 km2, and is known to exist in less than five independent locations. A noticed continuing decline in the population fulfilled sub-criterion &quot;2c&quot;, given the condition of the population&#x27;s sole habitat. Criterion &quot;D1&quot; essentially required that a population be composed of less than 250 mature individuals; individual counts of the &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; population at the time figured significantly lower than this. In 2000, the tamaraw was relisted on the Red List under the more severe &quot;C1&quot; criteria. This was due to estimates that the population would decline by 20% in five years or within the timespan of two generations.

Many factors have contributed to the decline of the tamaraw population. Over the course of the century, the increase of the human population on Mindoro has exposed the island&#x27;s sole tamaraw population to severe anthropogenic pressures. In the 1930s, the introduction of non-native cattle on the island caused a severe rinderpest epidemic among the tamaraw population then numbering in the thousands. Hunting of tamaraws for food and sustenance has also taken a toll on the species&#x27; numbers. The most major factor threatening survival of &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; is habitat loss due to infrastructure development, logging, and agriculture. These factors reduced the population of thousands during the early 1900s to less than 300 individuals in 2007.

Due to the decline of the &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; population, various Philippine laws and organizations have been created towards the conservation of the species. In 1936, Commonwealth Act No. 73 was enacted by the then-Philippine Commonwealth. The act specifically prohibited killing, hunting, and even merely wounding tamaraws, with an exception noted for self-defense (if one were to be attacked by an agitated individual) or for scientific purposes. The penalties were harsh enough to include a hefty fine and imprisonment.

In 1979, an executive order was signed creating a committee specifically geared towards the conservation of the tamaraw; it was referred to as a &quot;source of national pride&quot; in the said order. The Tamaraw Conservation Project was also established in 1979. The organization has successfully bred a tamaraw, nicknamed &quot;Kali&quot;, in captivity in 1999. In 2001, Republic Act 9147, or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act was enacted to protect the tamaraw and other endemic species from hunting and sale. During the 1970s, a gene pool was established to preserve the tamaraw&#x27;s numbers. However, the project was not successful, as only one offspring, named &quot;Kali&quot;, was produced. As of 2011, Kali is the only surviving animal in the gene pooling project. The project was also not improved as the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau showed that the tamaraws were already breeding in the wild. Cloning was not implemented for conservation as the Department of Environment and Natural Resource argued that such measures would diminish the genetic diversity of the species.

A small subpopulation of tamaraws has been found within the confines of the Mt. Iglit Game Refuge and Bird Sanctuary on Mindoro.

As of May 2007, &quot;B. mindorensis&quot; is on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, where it has been since the species was first put on the list on January 7, 1975. With the listing, CITES recognizes the species as critically endangered and threatened with extinction. Thus, international commercial trade in the species or any derivatives of which, such as meat or horns, is considered illegal. While commercial trade in the species is prohibited, exchange for noncommercial reasons, such as scientific research, is allowed.

The 2002 Presidential Proclamation 273 set October as a &quot;Special Month for the Conservation and Protection of the Tamaraw in Mindoro.&quot;.

As of April 2019, according to June Pineda, Tamaraw Conservation Program coordinator of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the latest count at Mounts Iglit-Baco National Park in Occidental Mindoro showed 466 to 494 tamaraws, lower than 2018’s 523 animals.

==Importance to humans==

===Economical and commercial value===
While not as heavily exploited as other large, endangered mammals, the tamaraw population was subject to some harvesting pressure from subsistence hunters before conservation efforts were spurred towards the latter half of the 20th century. The IUCN has described this as still going on in their 2006 Red List report.
===In Philippine culture===

Though the national animal of the Philippines is the carabao, the tamaraw is also considered a national symbol of the Philippines. An image of the animal is featured on a Flora and Fauna Series 1 peso coin released from 1983 to 1994.

In 2004, Proclamation No. 692 was enacted to make October 1 a special working holiday in the province of Occidental Mindoro. In line with the Tamaraw Conservation Month, the proclamation aimed to remind the people of Mindoro the importance of the conservation of the tamaraw and its environment.

During the wake of the Asian utility popularity in the 1990s, Toyota Motors Philippines released the Toyota Kijang as the &quot;Tamaraw FX&quot;, an evolution of the Tamaraw AUV. It was widely patronized by taxi operators, and was immediately turned into a staple mode of transportation much like a cross of the taxi and the jeepney. The FX later saw a new generation model known locally as the Revo The tamaraw is also the mascot of the varsity teams of the Far Eastern University (FEU Tamaraws) in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines, and of the Toyota Tamaraws of the Philippine Basketball Association. The Tamaraw Falls in Barangay Villaflor, Puerto Galera, were also named after the bovine.

<text>Stefan Vladislav (, ;  – after 1264) was the King of Serbia from 1234 to 1243. He was the middle son of Stefan the First-Crowned of the Nemanjić dynasty, who ruled Serbia from 1196 to 1228. Radoslav, the eldest son of Stefan the First-Crowned, was ousted by the Serbian nobility due to increasing Epirote influence through his marriage alliance to Theodore Komnenos Doukas; thus Vladislav became his successor. He is celebrated as Saint Vladislav by the Serbian Orthodox Church. 

During Vladislav&#x27;s reign, his uncle Archbishop Sava went on a pilgrimage and died in Bulgaria while on his way home. Vladislav obtained the remains and buried them in the Mileševa monastery, which he had built intended to be his burial place. Serbia was politically aligned with Bulgaria at the time, since Vladislav was married to Beloslava, the daughter of Ivan Asen II. Vladislav secured Hum, a maritime province under attack by Hungarian crusaders.

After the death of Ivan Asen II, there was unrest in Serbia. The Mongols, led by Kadan, invaded Hungary and devastated the Balkans, at which time the Serbian nobility rose up against Vladislav. In 1243, he abdicated in favour of his younger brother, but remained the governor of Zeta. The Serbian Orthodox Church venerates him as a saint on .

==Early life==
Vladislav was born around 1198. His parents were King Stefan the First-Crowned and Queen Eudokia. He had two full brothers, Stefan Radoslav (b. 1192) and Predislav (b. 1201), and a younger agnate half-brother, Stefan Uroš I (b. 1223). He also had two sisters, Komnena being the only one whose name is known.

King Stefan the First-Crowned, who had become ill, took monastic vows and died in 1227, and Radoslav, the eldest son, became king; he was crowned at Žiča by his uncle, Archbishop Sava. Radoslav&#x27;s younger brothers, Vladislav and Uroš I, received appanages. Sava II (Predislav) was appointed Bishop of Hum shortly thereafter, later serving as Archbishop of Serbia from 1263 to 1270. The Church and state was thus controlled by the same family, and the ties between the two continued.

==Accession==
According to monk and biographer Teodosije the Hilandarian, King Radoslav was a good ruler at first, but fell under the influence of his wife, Queen Anna, daughter of the Epirote ruler Theodore Komnenos Doukas (1216–1230). The Serbian nobility most likely disliked Radoslav due to this Greek influence. Radoslav was probably safe from domestic rebellion as long as Theodore remained strong. 

In 1230, Theodore was defeated and captured by Emperor Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, after which Radoslav&#x27;s position seems to have weakened; some of his nobility revolted in the autumn of 1233. Teodosije said that the nobility no longer supported Radoslav, and instead supported Vladislav. Radoslav and his wife fled to Dubrovnik in 1233. He was unable to regain the kingdom, but eventually returned as a monk. There are indications that Radoslav organized rebellions against Vladislav, and that he thought that he would regain the throne. This is evident from a document dated February 4, 1234, which promised Ragusa trading privileges once Radoslav had returned to Serbia and become king again. Because of this, Vladislav began threatening Ragusa, which then turned to Ban Matej Ninoslav of Bosnia for help. The revolt against Vladislav was unsuccessful, and Radoslav joined the court of Epirote ruler Manuel in Dyrrhachium. 

Archbishop Sava tried to stop the conflict. He most likely sympathized with Radoslav, as he was the legitimate ruler. However, to stop the conflict, which could become more serious, Vladislav was crowned king upon Radoslav&#x27;s departure from Serbia. Thanks to Sava, Vladislav married the daughter of Ivan Asen II. Sava then abdicated in favour of his apprentice, Arsenije, at the end of 1233. Radoslav contacted Archbishop Sava, who welcomed him back to Serbia. Radoslav took monastic vows, and took the name &quot;Jovan&quot; (John). According to Teodosije, Sava did this to protect Radoslav from Vladislav. In 1235, while visiting the Bulgarian court, Sava died while on his way home from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He was respectfully buried at the Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo. Sava&#x27;s body was returned to Serbia after a series of requests, and was then buried in the Mileševa monastery, built by Vladislav in 1234. Sava was canonized, and his relics were considered miraculous; his cult remained throughout the Middle Ages and the Ottoman occupation.

After Radoslav had returned to Serbia as a monk, the details of his relationship with Vladislav are not fully known, but he likely did not disturb Vladislav. Some even believe that Radoslav received a part of Serbia to administrate. In any case, Radoslav lived the rest of his life in peace. 

==Foreign policy==
The Bulgarians lost Braničevo and Belgrade to Hungary in the late 1230s, and Hungarian crusaders fought in Bosnia between 1235 and 1241. Serbia was never directly attacked by the Hungarians. However, the Hungarian crusaders did directly threaten Serbian Hum; they may have even occupied parts of it. In 1237, Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria attacked Hum, but it is unclear whether they attacked Serbian Hum (Eastern), or western Hum, between the Neretva and Cetina rivers, where the Serbs held no territory at the time. The northern part, which was held by Vladislav&#x27;s relative, Toljen II, fell quickly, but Vladislav dispatched an army to regain the region. The crusaders were pushed to the border, and Vladislav pursued them as far as the Cetina River, but there were no major encounters. After the incident, the Serbs asserted their possession of the Hum region, and Vladislav added &quot;Hum&quot; to his title.

These events threatened Serbia, which had severed ties with Catholicism and was once again fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may be a result of the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers&#x27; countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian suzerainty, but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence on the politics of Vladislav.

In 1235, Vladislav signed a treaty regarding trading privileges with Giovanni Dandolo, a representative of Ragusa. The treaty gave Ragusa trading privileges under the condition that Ragusa would never allow any preparation of rebellion against Serbia on their territory, as Ragusa had helped Radoslav upon his exile.

Pope Gregory IX&#x27;s crusade against the Bogumils in Bosnia, who were deemed heretics, did not bring good results. Central Bosnia was not conquered, and Bosnian Ban Matej Ninoslav and his nobility retreated to the Republic of Ragusa in 1240. In an edict issued by Ninoslav on 22 March 1240, Ninoslav promised to protect the city of Ragusa (Dubrovnik) if Vladislav attacked. At the time, Serbian forces in the region of Hum roamed around Dubrovnik. The Ragusans may have feared Vladislav due to the earlier disputes with him, or Vladislav may have posed an actual danger to Ragusa.

==Mongol invasion==
Ivan Asen II was a powerful support to Vladislav; when Asen died, there was internal unrest, also affected by the Mongols threat. Between 1206 and 1227, the Mongol leader Genghis Khan conquered territories that none before him had been able to conquer; his empire extended all over Asia and to Crimea. By 1240, all of Russia had been captured by the Mongols; Poland, Hungary, and parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia were subsequently taken. In the winter of 1241, the Mongols crossed the Danube and entered western Hungary; Béla IV could not manage to organize any resistance. All of Croatia was burned, and Kadan and Batu Khan (the grandson of Genghis Khan) looked for Béla IV, who was in Split at the time; Béla soon moved to Trogir, as Split was not safe. The Mongols did not attack Split, but instead unsuccessfully attacked Klis, where they had heard that Béla IV was hiding. Béla then fled to the island of Rab. The Mongols attempted to conquer the island, but their forces were hurt in naval battles; they were also forced to hurry back home to choose the new Khan after the death of Ogatay. While returning home, they crossed and devastated Serbia, Bosnia and Bulgaria. Although the Serbian lowland was destroyed, the Mongol attack did not have a large impact, as the population had retreated into inaccessible forests that Mongols had no will to enter. The Serbian cities of Kotor, Drivast and Svač were destroyed. The Mongol invasion brought turmoil and shock, but not any major changes; the real shock came when Asen died, which left Vladislav without significant support.

==Ousting==
In spring 1243, an uprising ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, was put on the throne. Scholars have argued that Bulgarian influence had been strong and unpopular, causing opposition that led to Vladislav&#x27;s deposition after the death of Asen.

The revolting nobility had chosen Uroš as their candidate for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a war for the throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced to give up the crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main resistance against Uroš was led by Vladislav&#x27;s wife Beloslava, who spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The fact that she was the organizer of the resistance against Uroš is known from an edict dated to the summer of 1243, in which the Ragusans swore to King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava&#x27;s resistance work. The hostilities did not last long, and the brothers quickly settled. Uroš was courteous towards Vladislav, gave him the administration of Zeta, with residence in Skadar. He died around 1269, and was buried in Mileševa monastery.

==Regal name and titles==
The king&#x27;s given name was Vladislav, while &quot;Stefan&quot; was a name adopted by all Nemanjić dynasty monarchs. The name is derived from Greek word &quot;Stephanos&quot;, meaning &quot;crown&quot;. The tradition of medieval Serbian rulers taking the name is likely connected with the Byzantine association of the martyrdom of Saint Stephen. The custom began already with Vukanović dynasty and was continued by Stefan Nemanja and his successors, until the last ruler of the Nemanjić dynasty. St. Stephen was the patron saint of the Serbian state and government; he was depicted on the royal seals and coins of the early Nemanjić rulers. The name was more of a title than name in the Serbian rulers, and it had a special symbolical meaning to the Serbian state. 

In Serbian medieval biographies, Vladislav was praised as &quot;the Faithful&quot;, &quot;the God-Loving&quot;, &quot;the Christ-Loving&quot;, &quot;the Great&quot;, &quot;the World-Loving&quot;. In modern historiography, he is sometimes designated as &quot;Stefan Vladislav I&quot; to distinguish him from the later Stefan Vladislav II, son of Stefan Dragutin, who ruled ower Syrmia.

The introduction of Vladislav&#x27;s charter says: &quot;Stefan Vladislav, with the help and grace of God, crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime Lands&quot;, while the signature reads: &quot;Stefan Vladislav, by the grace of God, the King and Autokrator of All Serbian and Maritime Lands&quot;. Sometimes, his signature said, &quot;Stefan Vladislav, with the help of God, the Serbian King&quot;. In Latin documents, he was called &quot;Stephanus Vladislav, Serbiae rex&quot; (1238). He also signed himself with the expanded title of his father: &quot;King of All Rascian Lands, and Diocletia, and Dalmatia, and Travunia, and Zachumlia&quot;. The style &quot;&quot;Rascian&quot; lands&quot; was used in the tutelage during the reign of Uroš I (r. 1112–1145).

When Serbian royalty was canonized, the church sometimes used their given names; examples of this include: St. Stefan Vladislav (&quot;Св. Стефан Владислав, краљ српски&quot;), Milutin, Stefan Uroš I, Stefan Uroš II, Urošica, and others.

==Flag of Serbia==

The son of King Stefan Vladislav, Desa Župan, sent delegates from Kotor to Ragusa (Dubrovnik) to return items from the king&#x27;s treasury; the inventory list included, among other things, &quot;a flag of red and blue colour&quot; (&quot;vexillum unum de zendato rubeo et blavo&quot; - a flag made of red and blue fabric, &quot;zendato&quot; or &quot;čenda&quot; being a type of light, silky fabric). This is the oldest existing information on the colours of the Serbian flag. Thus, the oldest known Serbian flag was red and blue. But already in 1271 the colors of the flag of his son Desa, were red and white. Although the color order is not known, the version with horizontal red and blue is sometimes used in medieval-themed events in modern Serbia, representing the oldest known Serbian flag.

==Family==
Through his marriage with Beloslava, the daughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, Stefan Vladislav had the following children:
* Stefan, who died before 1281 in Esphigmenou.
* Desa župan, Duke of Kotor (fl. 1281–1285).
* A daughter, who married Đura Kačić, the count of Omiš (fl. 1276).

<text>Vladislav (; 1280–1326) was the King of Syrmia from 1316 to 1325, and claimant to the Serbian Kingdom.

He was the son of Stefan Dragutin, who had ruled Serbia until 1282, when he became ill and abdicated, giving the superior rule to his younger brother Stefan Milutin. Dragutin continued to rule the royal domain of Syrmia, which was later inherited by Vladislav.

==Early life==
Born around 1270, Vladislav was the eldest son of the Crown Prince of Serbia, Stefan Dragutin, and Catherine of Hungary. Shortly before Vladislav&#x27;s birth, Dragutin was awarded with the title of &quot;junior king&quot; in token of his right to succeed his father, Stefan Uroš I. Vladislav became the new heir to the Serbian throne after Dragutin dethroned his father with Hungarian assistance in 1276. A riding accident forced Dragutin to abdicate in favor of his younger brother, Stefan Milutin, in the spring of 1282, but he could retain the northern regions of Serbia as a separate realm. The Byzantine historian, George Pachymeres, recorded that the right of one of Dragutin&#x27;s two sons (Vladislav or Urošica) to succeed Milutin was also confirmed.

Vladislav&#x27;s maternal cousin, Charles Martel of Anjou, who had laid claim to Hungary, awarded Vladislav with Slavonia and granted him the title of duke, implying that Vladislav and his father supported Charles Martel against Andrew III of Hungary in the early 1290s. Charles Martel&#x27;s father, Charles II of Naples, confirmed the grant on 19 August 1292. Dragutin and Vladislav sought reconciliation with Andrew III. In 1293, Vladislav married Constanza Morosini who was a granddaughter of the king&#x27;s maternal uncle, Albertino Morosini.

Milutin made steps to appoint his eldest son, Stefan Konstantin, as his heir from around 1306. He even approached Pope Clement V and offered the union of the Serbian Orthodox Church with Rome in return for the confirmation of Stefan Konstantin&#x27;s right to succeed him.

Dragutin and Vladislav&#x27;s support to Charles Martel ended in 1293 after Vladislav married Costanza Morosini, the niece of Andrew III. Andrew III died in 1301 and was succeeded by Charles Martel&#x27;s son, Charles Robert.
After King Dragutin died in 1316, Vladislav succeeded him as ruler of the Kingdom of Syrmia, but the king of Serbia, Stefan Milutin, his uncle, defeated him and imprisoned him.
When Milutin died in 1321, the newly freed Vladislav got to rule the lands of his father, with the help of the Hungarians, the Bulgarians, the Bosnian Ban and the Šubić family. The rule, according to law, was to be given to Vladislav.

Tsar Michael Asen III of Bulgaria, newly in conflict with Vladislav&#x27;s cousin Stefan Dečanski, the successor of Milutin, started to support Vladislav as the rightful monarch of whole Serbia, but this support showed insufficient. After having been beaten again by supporters of Stefan Dečanski, he retreated to the Kingdom of Hungary in 1324. Vladislav&#x27;s sororal nephew Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia, then started to rule Vladislav&#x27;s lands in Bosnia (Soli and Usora), and around Lower Syrmia where long battles between Serbs and Hungarians were frequent.

Vladislav was married to Constanza Morosini, maternal relative of Andrew III of Hungary.

<text>José Mariano Martín Buenaventura Ignacio Nepomuceno García de Arista Nuez (26 July 1802 – 7 August 1855) was a Mexican soldier and politician who also became president of Mexico. 

He was in command of the Mexican forces at the opening battles of the Mexican American War: the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, which were disastrous losses for Mexico and resulted in Arista being court martialled though eventually acquitted. He continued to play a notable role in government and was Minister of War under President Jose Joaquin Herrera.

Arista himself would succeed Herrera as president and his inauguration would mark the first peaceful transfer of power in Mexico since 1824. The Herrera and Arista administrations occurring immediately after the end of the Mexican American War were eras of stability, moderate rule, and economic growth. Writing in 1920, Mexican historian Francisco Bulnes rated Arista as the greatest of Mexico&#x27;s presidents. Arista, however would be overthrown after sweeping budget cuts led to widespread discontent. The insurgents who overthrew him brought Santa Anna back into power for what turned out to be his last dictatorship. Arista was exiled by Santa Anna, and died in Lisbon in 1855.

==Early life==
Arista was born on 26 July 1802 and in 1813 enlisted as a cadet in the regiment of provincials of Puebla. He belonged to the Veracruz Lancers, and to the Mexico Dragoons. The Mexican War of Independence had already broken out when Arista joined the military and he initially fought as a Royalist, distinguishing himself so well that in 1818 he was made an officer for the Mexican Dragoons. He was promoted to ensign in September 1820 and to lieutenant in May 1821. That same year he decided to join Agustin de Iturbide&#x27;s Plan of Iguala and on 11 June 1821 presented himself before the Army of the Three Guarantees, with a bugle, five officers and twenty dragoons of the Mexico Regiment, and fifty troops which he gathered from miscellaneous corps. He was assigned with all of them to the Libertad Regiment.

He was present at the siege of Puebla by the insurgents in July 1821. He fulfilled his orders of advancing with several dragoons up to the sentry-box of Cholula which had been repulsing all attempted attacks, and entered with his small forces close to the fortified point of San Javier. Under the command of Brigadier Pedro Zarazoa, he joined in various expeditions and offered his services during the final siege of Mexico City, forming a part of the first division. Due to his excellent service, ten days after the capture of the capital, he was granted the rank of captain, and in December 1821 was further promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. 

He belonged to the regiment of grenadiers that joined the command of General Echevarri and proclaimed against the First Mexican Empire in February 1823, and was so passionate about the cause that he halted soldiers who wished to join the Emperor, and Arista followed the liberating army until it captured the capital.

==First Mexican Republic==
During the transitional government of the Supreme Executive Power, he fought against an insurgency that had risen up against the government. He was present in June 1824 at a battle near the Hacienda of Coamancingo not far from Apam, and having reached a partisan of Vicente Gomez, he executed him after having come into conflict with various guerilla leaders. For this service, the Executive Power raised him to the rank of effective captain.

Five years later he had risen to the rank of effective lieutenant colonel. He took part in the rebellions against the election of Manuel Gomez Pedraza pronouncing at Perote with Santa Anna, and when General Anastasio Bustamante rose up in Jalapa against President Vicente Guerrero, Arista marched towards Puebla and sent four hundred cavalry to help those who had decided to join in the uprising. He took the city in spite of four thousand members of the militia who had opposed the . He gained the favor of President Bustamante and was promoted to effective colonel on 12 February 1831 and in August of that same year, Brigadier General, in spite of being opposed to the government&#x27;s annulment of the law which had expelled all Spaniards from the country. He fought uprisings against the government of Bustamante, in April 1832, under the command of General Inclan, defeating the forces which had risen up in Lerma as part of the Plan of Veracruz. After failing to dislodge Colonel Gonzales from his strongly fortified point at Santa Maria del Monte, he parleyed eventually bringing him back to supporting the government, thus pacifying all of the Valley of Toluca.

As President Bustamante personally began to lead his troops against the rebels, he was joined by Arista on the way to Querétaro. Here Arista parted ways with the president turning back at Morelia, and rejoining the main body of the military, he fought at the Jornada del Gallinero, and after victory there advanced within two leagues of Zacatecas before returning to aid the capital. He fought at Casas Blancas, but at this point the rebels won, and Arista was commissioned to arrange a ceasefire and sign the Convention of Zavaleta, transferring power over to Manuel Gomez Pedraza who had returned from an exile in order to assume the final months of the term he had first won in 1828, which was now being recognized.

When Valentin Gomez Farias and Santa Anna won the vice presidency and presidency respectively on a Liberal ticket, Gomez Pedraza continued to serve in the military, being charged with the security of transportation to Veracruz, and then being given the general commandancy of Mexico State. In June 1833 he was named second in command of the operations brigade commanded by Santa Anna, and was ordered to go out and fight the rebels who were aiming to proclaim Santa Anna dictator, and hoped to depose Gomez Farias for his anti clerical measures and his measures against military privileges. Arista however joined the rebels. Arista now sent agents to the capital to work against Gomez Farias. Being now a target of government reprisal, Arista fled to Guanajuato, where he surrendered under the promise of preserving his life and he was banished. He departed from Veracruz in November and left for the United States, and he returned once the triumphant Plan of Cuernavaca overthrew Gomez Farias in 1834.

==Centralist Republic of Mexico==
The First Mexican Republic was now in the process of being transformed into the Centralist Republic of Mexico. Arista arrived at Veracruz at the beginning of June 1835 although he initially found himself arrested, he was permitted later to continue on to the capital. He was stopped at Jalapa and returned to Veracruz on suspicions on having joined a mutiny at San Juan de Ulua, but was absolved. The new government named him to the Supreme Military Court, and later formed a part of the Junta for the Military and Civil Code, and was named inspector of militias.

He was attending to his various military posts when the Pastry War broke out in 1838 and the government of Anastasio Bustamante placed Arista in charge of a brigade tasked with defending Veracruz and subject to the orders of Manuel Rincon, which ordered Arista&#x27;s brigade to stay at the Paso de Ovejas where Arista learned of the French capture of San Juan de Ulua and received orders from Santa Anna to advance upon Veracruz. He entered the port on 4 December, at nine in the evening and met with Santa Anna whom he had not seen since 1833. The following morning the house they were staying at was attacked by the French. Arista fought back but was taken prisoner. He remained a prisoner of war aboard a French ship until 28 January 1839. 

After the Pastry War ended, he played a role in subduing the various insurgencies that were flaring up all over the country with the aim of reestablishing the federal system. He was named to head the brigade that left from San Luis to attack the dissidents that had fortified themselves at Tampico. He left the capital with rapidity organized the brigade and under the immediate orders of commander in chief Bustamante passed to Tamaulipas where the federalist forces were ensconced under the command of Jose Urrea. Arista pursued him as far as Ciudad Victoria and near Tampico, obtained a surrender of Urrea&#x27;s forces.

Arista was named commandant general of Tamaulipas, and afterwards commander in chief of the armies of the north at the end of 1839. He marched to Monterey, reorganized his military district, and fought against insurgents, dislodging them from Monterey and pursuing them as far as Coahuila after the Battle of Santa Rita de Morelos, in which he completely routed the rebels. He returned to Tampico where he helped prevent a riot, and later passed to Matamoros. With the country now pacified of insurgents, he focused on reorganizing the army meant to contribute to the defense of the national integrity against the forces of the Texas rebels. During the following five years he occupied himself with expeditions against hostile indigenous tribes and against Texas. During this time exchanged the office of Commander in Chief of the North with various other officers including Isidro Reyes and Adrian Woll.

==Mexican American War==
But Arista once again held the post when the United States annexed Texas. As tensions between the United States and Mexico were leading to war, Arista made considerable effort to secure the frontier, and increased the division under his command to six thousand men. He then obeyed an order from President Mariano Paredes to step down from his command, retiring to an hacienda which Arista owned close to Monterey. It was there though that he received another order to return to his post in April, 1846 as news arrived that American forces under the command of Zachary Taylor were heading to Matamoros.

After the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, Mexico&#x27;s government recalled Arista, and he was removed from command. He requested a court-martial and was absolved of guilt for the defeats at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. Arista spent the rest of the war as a functionary, seeing little combat.

==Presidency==
Campaigning for the presidential elections of 1851 began in the latter half of 1850. War Minister Arista, known for playing a guiding role in the Herrera Administration, found himself a front runner alongside men such as ex presidents Manuel Gomez Pedraza, Valentin Gomez Farias, Nicholas Bravo, and Santa Anna.

The opposition attacked Arista for having interfered in the election procedure for the Mexico City ayuntamiento, but ultimately the presidential election, decided by the states went in favor of Arista. He obtained thirteen out of nineteen total possible votes. The next closest candidate was ex-Minister of War Juan Almonte, who only received three votes.

Arista took office on 15 January 1851, and attracted ridicule by at once passing minor regulations for visitors to the National Palace. He decided to adopt many of Herrera&#x27;s policies, which he had already played a significant hand in enacting, but made some changes in the cabinet: Mariano Yañez was made Minister of Relations. Jose Maria Aguirre was made Minister of Justice. General Manuel Robles Pezuela was made Minister of War. Herrera&#x27;s Minister of Finance Payno kept his post.

===Financial issues===
Mexico&#x27;s chronic financial issues remained an imposing issue for the Arista administration. Government income stood at 8 million pesos while expenditure stood at 26 million. A goal was set to reduce the expenditure to 10 million pesos. In order to ameliorate the national finances Arista dramatically cut the salaries of public employees, up to seventy five percent in some cases but the cuts were applied unevenly many unnecessary expenditures remained. Finance Minister Manuel Payno resigned over differences on reducing the deficit.

Four of Payno&#x27;s successors also resigned in the span of about a month until Finance minister was assigned the post in May 1851. He proposed a light series of taxes to meet the deficit, but it was met with a barrage of opposition by the states, and congress refrained from pressing the matter. In August, he summoned a council of governors to suggest better remedies. The governors’ response was to attack the administration over its alleged lack of management and presented a new calculation of the national finances which showed no deficit at all. This was based upon a decree of November 1849 which had limited expenditures to half a million pesos a month. The governors offered to increase the state contributions from seven hundred thousand pesos to one million which did not significantly contribute to controlling the deficit.

The government required extra power from a hostile congress to act upon the new estimate which, in order to be valid required further budget cuts. The ministry resigned and a new cabinet was formed under Fernando Ramirez as Minister of Relations, as Minister of Justice, Marcos Esparza as Minister of Finance, and General Manuel Robles Pezuela remaining as Minister of War. The government gained some slight concessions from congress, but the legislature was largely idle, and received condemnation from the press. Certain journals floated the idea that the government should dissolve congress only to face arrest.

There was friction between the federal government and that of the states on financial matters. While states were struggling from a lack of funds, congress took care to issue a decree imposing an eight percent tax on duties for the payment o fits members and of treasury officials. The states were also growing loose in their observance of the federal bond and its obligations while neglecting to pay their contingents.

Minister Ramirez reached an arrangement on payments with foreign and domestic creditors who were complaining of smuggling and tariff infringement. The interior creditors had formed an association which claimed the right to be consulted in all custom house appointments. It was known as the junta de credito publico, having the right to appoint an agent to watch proceedings at custom houses. By a decree of May 19, 1852, an effort was made to carry out the provisions of November 1850 for the consolidation and settlement of the interior debt, but the funds assigned by the government proved insufficient to cover more than two thirds of the interest.

Meanwhile, the government&#x27;s budget cuts had resulted in a surge of crime due to a reduction in patrol services and the corruption of underpaid employees. The northeastern frontier was rife with smuggling due to the high duties the government had imposed. There was restlessness towards the policies of the federal government which had burdened the regions with troops perceived as useless who did nothing to protect the region.

===Assorted revolts===
Revolts against the government, so common during this era in Mexico, had broken out almost immediately after Arista&#x27;s election, although the government succeeded in suppressing insurrections that has broken out through 1851 in San Luis Potosí, Veracruz, Tlaxcala and certain parts of Jalisco.

In the northeastern provinces under the pretext of protesting the high tariff rates, José María Jesús Carbajal enlisted 500 mercenaries in Texas and crossed the border into Mexico on September 18 where he was joined by 200 more troops. They took Camargo and marched on Matamoros whereupon Avalos the local prefect agreed to a reduction on duties and a removal on prohibitions, which only resulted in Mexico being flooded by American goods against which Mexican manufacturing could not compete. The government sent reinforcements against Carbajal, who in spite of the concessions continued to siege Matamoros. The local garrison held their own against him, and news of the government reinforcements finally caused Carbajal to flee on October 30 and seek refuge across the border. In February 1852, Carbajal made another incursion, but anticipated by the government this time was repulsed by which time the government had also restored the old tariffs.

Ongoing revolts and rumors of revolutions caused the government to become more cautious and issue a number of arrests, and finally even the press was forbidden to criticize the government, the restriction being issued on 21 September 1852, a decree which was later declared unconstitutional on 13 October by the Supreme Court.

By the middle of 1852 Juan Clímaco Rebolledo had risen in Vera Cruz over financial policy, and his views were considered moderate enough that the Arista government instructed the state authorities to negotiate with him only to be rebuffed. At Mazatlan there was an uprising over dividing the state, and in Michoacan there was an uprising over anti-clerical and other measures passed by governor Melchor Ocampo.

===Plan of Jalisco===
In Jalisco, Governor had made himself unpopular by introducing an intrusive policy system and giving off the impression that he was merely a tool of the federalist government. He created a scandal when he arrested a hatmaker named Jose Maria Blancarte who was arrested for assaulting a police officer and expelled from the state militia, despite having been elected to the rank of colonel. On July 26, in response to this but also taking advantage of widespread discontent, Blancarte took possession of the gubernatorial palace at the head of a self-constituted council. The council proclaimed Gregoria Davila as the new governor and called upon him to summon a legislature, to revise the state constitution and introduce reforms with Blancarte retaining the chief military command. Portillo retreated with a few loyal troops to Lagos, where he called upon the federal government for aid, but they only sent unarmed negotiators, and meanwhile the Blancarte movement increased in strength.

At this point supporters of Santa Anna, known as the Santanistas reached out to Blancarte and successfully convinced the latter to increase the scope of his revolt. On 13 September, Blancarte proclaimed that Arista ought to be overthrown and that Santa Anna ought to be recalled to take a role in reorganizing the government. Davila, who up until now had been the political head of the movement stepped down rather than participate in a coup, and Santanistas replaced him with one of their own: General Yanez. A week later a modified form of the plan was placed under the head of Jose L. Uraga one of the military&#x27;s generals, who was called upon to replace congress with an assembly made up of two representatives from each state tasked with electing a president, revising the constitution on a federal basis, reforming the financial and electoral systems, reorganizing the army, and reforming frontier defenses against Indian raids. Upon hearing that Uraga had been chosen as leader, the government sought to transfer him away from Guadalajara, but Uraga resigned and agreed to join the revolutionists.

In late 1852, another wave of cabinet resignations led to the assumption of Mariano Yanez as minister of relations. J.M. Aguirre as minister of justice, Guillermo Prieto as Minister of Treasury, and ex-president Pedro Maria Anaya as Minister of War. As the Blancarte Revolt grew in strength, an extra session of congress was now called to consider a fresh appeal for aid, in the shape of a loan of three million pesos, additional taxes and special powers for the executive. A small advanced was secured to sustain an army against the insurrection, and congress was uneasy as only half of the governors now signaled even partial loyalty to the federal government. On 16 December 1852, Minister Prieto made a passionate appeal before the lower house.

The federal government had now lost the adherence of most of the nation. In the northeast Carbajal was once more undertaking yet another invasion and in Sonora the French adventurer Count Raousset de Boulbon was launching his own invasion. In December, the states of Tampico and Vera Cruz containing strategic ports, pronounced for the Plan of Jalisco.

After government forces were repulsed at Guadalajara on 15 December, Arista addressed the chambers once they met for the new year and resigned on 5 January. That midnight, Juan Bautista Ceballos was called to the National Palace and let known that the executive now passed on to him. Former President Arista left the Palace at half past thirty in the morning, leaving his official resignation with the Minister of Relations Arroyo to be handed over to congress. He carriage was escorted by fifty dragoons belonging to the fifth brigade, and he headed towards the Hacienda of Nanacampilpa, one of his properties. He remarked that &quot;This office [of the presidency] and its responsibilities are but a grave burden and a useless title, if they are not accompanies by the power and respect due to them.&quot;

==Later life==
When Santa Anna came back to power, Arista was expelled from the country. In poor health, he visited many cities in Europe before finally settling in Seville where his condition only became worse. He wished to return to Mexico, and finally got on board a ship to Lisbon, but as his health deteriorated he sought to go to Paris for medical help. He died on board the steamer Tagus on 7 August 1855, at half past ten in the evening.

He was buried in the cemetery of San Juan in Lisbon, and his burial was accompanied by members of the Lisbon diplomatic corp including those of England, the United States, and Mexico. When the liberal President Ignacio Comonfort came to power, he gave honors to Arista, and decreed that his ashes be brought to Mexico to be buried with other presidents.

<text>A stairwell or stair room is a room in a building where a stair is located, and is used to connect walkways between floors so that one can move in height. Collectively, a set of stairs and a stairwell is referred to as a staircase or stairway. In buildings with several housing units, a stairway can be a necessary common area for getting to and from apartments.

Staircases provide vertical access to connected floors in a multi-story building, and are a functional part of it. Stairwells are often used to place several stairs one above the other to save vertical space. The entrance to elevators is often located in the stairwell. Sometimes the stairwell goes around the lift shaft, other times it is placed next to it.

An &quot;exterior stairway&quot; is a stair in a separate structure attached to the rest of the building body, and can either be enclosed or exposed to the elements. Such temporary exposed stairways are sometimes used in conjunction with scaffolding on construction sites, or permanently as an emergency exit.

== History ==
The concept of stairs is believed to be 8000 years old, and are one of the oldest buildings in architectural history. The oldest example of spiral stairs dates back to the 400s BC. Medieval architecture saw experimentation with many different shapes, and the Renaissance even more so with varied designs.

== Lighting ==
Good lighting is important in a staircase so users see where they are going and to prevent falls. There is often a window on the wall to let in daylight. In many cases, indoor stairs are placed far inside the building structure, and it is often not easy to get access to a wall on the outside where it would be natural to have a regular window for letting daylight in. For this reason, it is not unusual to find a skylight or roof windows above a stairwell.

A research article suggests that perceived safety increases when using downwards lighting towards the stairs, while upwards lighting resulted in a substantial decrease of perceived safety.

== Handrail ==
In new stairways, some jurisdictions require handrails to be mounted on both sides.

== Emergency exit ==

Often the stairs in a stairwell are an emergency exit in case of fire, and the stairwell should then be a separate fire compartment separated from the rest of the building via fire doors.

For fire safety it can be advantageous that both the walls, ceiling and the stairs themselves in a stairwell are made of non-combustible materials, and be illuminated with daylight during the day and artificial lighting at darkness.

Storage of objects in shared stairwells is generally prohibited due to the fact that this is often an escape route. This applies to both flammable objects and other objects that may become an obstacle to the rescue work. Many housing cooperatives have general prohibitions against storage in common stairwells.

== Utilization ==
Under stairs there is often a lot of area and volume that is not otherwise used. There are several examples of creative uses, such as wardrobes, home offices, playroom, or general storage such as drawers, cupboards or shelves for storage.

<text> (, &quot;domain&quot;) is a Japanese historical term for the estate of a daimyo in the Edo period (1603–1868) and early Meiji period (1868–1912). or (daimyo domain) served as a system of &quot;de facto&quot; administrative divisions of Japan alongside the &quot;de jure&quot; provinces until they were abolished in the 1870s.

==History==
===Pre-Edo period===
The concept of originated as the personal estates of prominent warriors after the rise of the Kamakura Shogunate in 1185, which also saw the rise of feudalism and the samurai noble warrior class in Japan. This situation existed for 400 years during the Kamakura Shogunate (1185–1333), the brief Kenmu Restoration (1333–1336), and the Ashikaga Shogunate (1336–1573). became increasingly important as &quot;de facto&quot; administrative divisions as subsequent Shoguns stripped the Imperial provinces () and their officials of their legal powers.

===Edo period===
Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the preeminent warlord of the late Sengoku period (1467–1603), caused a transformation of the system during his reforms of the feudal structure of Japan. Hideyoshi&#x27;s system saw the become an abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields, rather than delineated territory. Hideyoshi died in 1598 and his young son Toyotomi Hideyori was displaced by Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara in October 1600, but his new feudal system was maintained after Ieyasu established the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603. The belonged to daimyo, the powerful samurai feudal lords, who governed them as personal property with autonomy as a vassal of the Tokugawa Shogun. Ieyasu&#x27;s successors further refined the system by introducing methods that ensured control of the daimyo and the imperial court. For instance, relatives and retainers were placed in politically and militarily strategic districts while potentially hostile daimyo were transferred to unimportant geographic locations or their estates confiscated. They were also occupied with public works that kept them financially drained as the daimyo paid for the bakufu projects.

Unlike Western feudalism, the value of a Japanese feudal domain was now defined in terms of projected annual income rather than geographic size. were valued for taxation using the system which determined value based on output of rice in , a Japanese unit of volume considered enough rice to feed one person for one year. A daimyo was determined by the Tokugawa as a lord heading a assessed at 10,000 (50,000 bushels) or more, and the output of their contributed to their prestige or how their wealth were assessed. Early Japanologists such as Georges Appert and Edmond Papinot made a point of highlighting the annual yields which were allocated for the Shimazu clan at Satsuma Domain since the 12th century. The Shogunal and the Imperial provinces served as complementary systems which often worked in tandem for administration. When the Shogun ordered the daimyos to make a census of their people or to make maps, the work was organized along the borders of the provinces. As a result, a could overlap multiple provinces which themselves contained sections of multiple . In 1690, the richest was the Kaga Domain, located in the provinces of Kaga, Etchū and Noto, with slightly over 1 million .

===Meiji period===

In 1868, the Tokugawa Shogunate was overthrown in the Meiji Restoration by a coalition of pro-Imperial samurai in reaction to the . One of the main driving forces of the anti-Tokugawa movement was support for modernization and Westernization in Japan. From 1869 to 1871, the new Meiji government sought to abolish feudalism in Japan, and the title of daimyo in the system was altered to or . In 1871, almost all of the domains were disbanded and replaced with a new Meiji system of prefectures which were directly subordinate to the national government in Tokyo.

However, in 1872, the Meiji government created the Ryukyu Domain after Japan formally annexed the Ryukyu Kingdom, a vassal state of the Shimazu clan of Satsuma since 1609. The Ryūkyū Domain was governed as a headed by the Ryukyuan monarchy until it was finally abolished and became Okinawa Prefecture in March 1879.

<doc id="256550" wikidata="Q927532" url="?curid=256550" title="Kenny Everett">
<text>Kenny Everett (born Maurice James Christopher Cole; 25 December 1944 – 4 April 1995) was an English radio DJ and television entertainer, known for his zany comedic style. After spells on pirate radio and Radio Luxembourg in the mid-1960s, he was one of the first DJs to join BBC Radio&#x27;s newly created BBC Radio 1 in 1967. It was here he developed his trademark voices and comical characters which he later adapted for television.

Everett was dismissed from the BBC in 1970 after making a flippant comment on air after a news item concerning a government minister&#x27;s wife. He was later re-instated at the BBC, working both on local and national radio, but, in the autumn of 1973, when commercial radio became licensed in the UK, he joined Capital Radio. Starting in the late 1970s, he transitioned to television where he made numerous comedy series on ITV and BBC, often appearing with Cleo Rocos, whose glamour and curvaceous figure were often used to comic effect. Rocos would be his assistant in the 1987 BBC gameshow &quot;Brainstorm&quot;. He was a highly versatile performer, able to write his own scripts, compose jingles and operate advanced recording and mixing equipment. His personality also made him a regular guest on chat shows and game shows such as &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;.

Everett openly supported the UK&#x27;s Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher and made a public appearance at the Young Conservatives conference in 1983. However, as a closeted gay man, he would face criticism for the hypocrisy of supporting a Conservative government that enacted Section 28, a clause of the Local Government Act which made it illegal for councils to promote gay rights and issues. He was diagnosed with HIV in 1989 and died in 1995.

==Early life==
Maurice James Christopher Cole was born on Christmas Day 1944 at 14 Hereford Road, Seaforth, north of Liverpool city centre. From a Roman Catholic family, he attended St Bede&#x27;s, the local secondary modern school, in Crosby (now part of Sacred Heart Catholic College). Cole later attended a junior seminary at Stillington, North Yorkshire, near York, with an Italian missionary order, the Verona Fathers, where he was a choirboy. After he left school, he worked in a bakery and in the advertising department of &quot;The Journal of Commerce and Shipping Telegraph&quot;.

==Radio==

=== Radio London, Radio Luxembourg and BBC Radio 1 ===
During 1963 he sent copies of his short, home-produced radio shows to Tape Recording Magazine, and they suggested sending a tape to the BBC. &quot;The Maurice Cole Quarter of an Hour Show&quot; led to an appearance, in May 1964, as a guest on the BBC Home Service show &quot;Midweek&quot;, and a few weeks later to an audition at Broadcasting House. Nerves got the better of him, and it didn&#x27;t lead to a job offer, but they suggested he send a tape to the producers looking for presenters for the soon to be launched pirate station Radio London. Everett then began his broadcasting career, on 25 December 1964 (his 20th birthday), as a DJ for Radio London. Before taking to the airwaves, he was advised to change his name to avoid legal problems. He adopted the name &quot;Everett&quot; from a childhood hero, the American comic actor Edward Everett Horton.

Everett teamed with Dave Cash for the &quot;Kenny &amp; Cash Show&quot;, one of the most popular pirate radio programmes. His offbeat style and likeable personality quickly gained him attention, but in November 1965 he was dismissed after some outspoken remarks about religion on air. Like most of the pirate stations, Radio London carried sponsored American evangelical shows and Everett&#x27;s disparaging remarks about &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; caused its producers to threaten to withdraw their lucrative contract with the station. After a spell at Radio Luxembourg, and another dismissal, Everett returned to Radio London in June 1966. He accompanied The Beatles on their August 1966 tour of the United States, sending back daily reports for Radio London.

Johnny Beerling, a BBC producer, secretly visited Radio London in February 1967, and observed Everett at work: &quot;I saw this man Everett doing everything. In the old way of doing things, the DJ sat in one room with a script. Someone else played the records and somebody else controlled the sound. Yet I see this man who has control of everything.&quot; An audition tape submitted to the BBC was assessed in March 1967 by a panel:

&quot;Member one: &#x27;A pseudo-American voice. Sounds experienced and seems to fancy his luck. Yes.&#x27;
Member two: &#x27;By far the most original of the young DJs. I found the stilted bits in bad taste but with suitable restraint and encouragement, Kenny Everett could be one of the BBC&#x27;s best DJs. Yes.&#x27;
Member three: &#x27;Without the hard sell and the occasional phoney American accent, a good pop DJ. Must be made to curb the funnies and the voices. Yes.&#x27;
Member four: &#x27;I found the continuous changes of voices irritating and his personality supercilious but he certainly has some talent. Should be available but would need very firm production. Yes.&#x27;&quot;
Everett was heard in May 1967 on the BBC&#x27;s soon to be discontinued BBC Light Programme previewing the Beatles&#x27; forthcoming album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band.&quot; He later produced their 1968 and 1969 Christmas records.

Everett was one of the DJs on the new pop music station Radio 1 from its launch at the end of September 1967. While at Radio 1, he continued to develop his distinctive presentation style, encouraged by producer Angela Bond, who had persuaded her superiors to give him his first programme, although he later reacted against her as a representative of the BBC. Everett&#x27;s Radio 1 show featured zany voices, comical characters, multi-tracked jingles and trailers, all of his own creation and compilation. It was Everett who had persuaded Johnny Beerling and station controller Robin Scott, at a lunch meeting before his appointment, of the importance of the new station having jingles. Everett&#x27;s shows on Radio 1 included &quot;Midday Spin&quot; and in late 1967 he took over his own show on Sunday mornings from 10 am to noon.

In July 1968, Everett briefly took over a daily show for Radio 1, entitled &quot;Foreverett&quot;. This went out from 6.45-7.30 pm on a Monday to Friday evening. At the time, this was becoming a gruelling schedule for Everett, so in early 1969 he took over a Saturday show from 10 am to noon.

In 1970, Everett again found himself dismissed, this time after suggesting on air that Mary Peyton, the British Transport Minister&#x27;s wife, had bribed her driving test examiner. The remark was a spontaneous quip, following a news item describing how Peyton had finally passed after many attempts. The BBC thought the comment &quot;indefensible&quot;, although shortly before the incident Everett had given a controversial interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; contrary to a BBC embargo preventing him from giving interviews. In negotiations with the record companies and the Musicians&#x27; Union over needle time, a limit on the playing on-air of commercially recorded music, the MU representatives would complain about Everett, the one BBC broadcaster who persistently mocked them. In fact, in the year after Everett&#x27;s death, it was stated that the bribery quip was merely an excuse and that the real reason was because he threatened to go public on the restrictive practices and deals with the Musicians&#x27; Union that were not only frustrating him and his listeners, but also making Radio One much less popular than the pirate stations it had been set up to displace.

Following an interview on the BBC Radio Solent children&#x27;s show &quot;Albert&#x27;s Gang&quot;, Everett submitted weekly shows to the station that he had pre-recorded at home. This afforded the BBC the opportunity to vet the shows before broadcast. Everett was then heard on various BBC local radio stations before being reinstated at Radio 1 in April 1973. Here he recorded a weekly show from his home in Llandovery, Wales and it went out at 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon.

=== Capital Radio ===
During this time, legislation had been passed allowing the licensing of commercial radio stations in the UK. One of the first, Capital Radio, began broadcasting to London and the home counties in October 1973. Everett joined the station and was given a weekend (recorded) show, where he further developed his distinctive ideas. From January 1974, following poor audience figures which in turn followed a difficult start for Capital during a time of industrial strife, the station changed to a more pop-based, rather than light music, format, with Everett presenting the breakfast show with his former colleague and friend from the pirate station Radio London (Big L) days, Dave Cash, and so reactivating the &quot;Kenny and Cash&quot; show. When Cash moved to the lunchtime slot in 1975, Everett continued alone on the breakfast show. Everett had a great love of sound recording equipment, in particular using reel-to-reel tape recorders and mixing equipment, often adding sound-on-sound to his recordings and stereo/multi-track recordings of his pseudo-singing voice. These were broadcast on air regularly and he often created his own radio jingles. Everett created many comedy characters on &quot;The Breakfast Show&quot; with Cash on Capital.

In May 1975, Everett found early mornings too much for his lifestyle and he vacated the breakfast show to Graham Dene and moved to less high-pressure weekend timeslots at Capital on Saturday and Sunday lunchtimes. Here he further developed his style and his cult following, and featured both what he thought the best in music (Queen, Chris Rainbow) and the worst, which led to the popular &quot;Kenny Everett&#x27;s World&#x27;s Worst Record Show&quot; programmes, later released as an album in 1978, with slightly different tracks.

In 1975, Everett played a pivotal role in getting Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; released as a single. In 1976, he also presented a pre-recorded programme on Saturday lunch-time for Radio Victory in Portsmouth, later providing Captain Kremmen to the station for transmission in Dave Christian&#x27;s late show. The series was also heard on Beacon Radio in the Midlands.

=== BBC Radio and back to Capital ===
On 5 February 1980, Everett made his only appearance on the BBC Radio 4 show &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, where he spoke on the subject of marbles for 90 seconds. The extended improvisation was imposed by Nicholas Parsons as a practical joke.

In October 1981, Everett returned to BBC Radio, this time on Radio 2, on Saturdays from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 pm. The show ended in December 1983, a couple of weeks after he made a risqué on-air joke about Margaret Thatcher

Everett returned to Capital Radio in June 1984, reviving his Saturday lunchtime show. In May 1985, he was called in to replace Graeme Garden for one episode of the Radio 4 game show &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;. After Capital split its frequencies in 1988, he returned to daily broadcasting on Capital Gold, as part of a strong presenting line-up including Tony Blackburn and David Hamilton. Everett presented daytime shows on weekdays until 1994, when his health deteriorated to the point he was unable to continue. During that same year, he was awarded the Special Gold Award at Sony&#x27;s Radio Academy Awards for his contribution to radio.

==Television==

Everett&#x27;s first screen appearance was in the 1965 film &quot;Dateline Diamonds&quot;, which had a plot based around the pirate ship MV &quot;Galaxy&quot;. He also appeared in several television series, beginning in 1968 with a production for Granada Television called &quot;Nice Time&quot; which was co-presented by Germaine Greer and Jonathan Routh. In 1970 he made three series for London Weekend Television (LWT): &quot;The Kenny Everett Explosion&quot;, &quot;Making Whoopee&quot; and &quot;Ev&quot;; and he also took part (along with such talents as Willie Rushton and John Wells) in the 1972 BBC TV series &quot;Up Sunday&quot;.

Although never a regular presenter on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, in 1973 Everett made seven appearances (six as solo host, and one as a co-host), in the months leading up to his departure from the BBC to join Capital Radio. Also in 1973, Everett provided the voice of the cat &#x27;Charley&#x27; in the &quot;Charley Says&quot; animated series of public information films. Everett was the announcer on the original version of ATV&#x27;s &quot;big box game&quot; &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, which ran on ITV from 1975 to 1979.

He was a frequent panel guest on the BBC quiz show &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. On his first appearance in 1979, he unexpectedly bent Terry Wogan&#x27;s microphone, the so-called Wogan&#x27;s Wand. This became a running joke whenever Everett appeared on the show. He also hosted two short-lived quiz shows late in his career, &quot;Brainstorm&quot; and &quot;Gibberish&quot;. He was a team captain on &quot;That&#x27;s Showbusiness&quot;.

=== &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot; ===

In 1978, London&#x27;s Thames Television offered him a new venture, which became &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Show&quot;. This was a vehicle for Everett&#x27;s characters and sketches (his fellow writers were Ray Cameron, Barry Cryer and Dick Vosburgh), interspersed with the latest pop hits, either performed by the artists themselves, or as backing tracks to dance routines by Arlene Phillips&#x27; risqué dance troupe Hot Gossip (which featured Sarah Brightman).

Various pop and TV stars made cameo appearances on the show, including Rod Stewart, Elkie Brooks, Billy Connolly, Kate Bush, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury, Terry Wogan and Suzi Quatro. Classical musicians such as Julian Lloyd Webber also appeared.

There were also the stories of Captain Kremmen, a science fiction hero voiced by Everett and originally developed for his Capital Radio shows, who travelled the galaxy battling fictional alien menaces, along with his assistant Dr Gitfinger and his voluptuous sidekick Carla. In the first three series these segments were animations created by the Cosgrove-Hall partnership (responsible for the successful children&#x27;s cartoon series &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, among many others). In the fourth series (&quot;Video Cassette&quot;), Kremmen was featured as live action with Anna Dawson playing Carla; the segments were comedy shorts rather than the earlier stories.

Other characters included: ageing rock-and-roller Sid Snot, unsuccessfully flipping cigarettes into his mouth—at one point Everett managed to catch one in his mouth, to the amusement of the studio crew; Marcel Wave, a lecherous Frenchman played by Everett wearing an absurdly false latex chin; and &quot;Angry of Mayfair&quot;, a right-wing, upper-middle-class City gent complaining of the permissive, risqué content of the show, banging the camera&#x27;s lens hood with his umbrella before storming off, turning his back to the camera to reveal him wearing women&#x27;s lingerie in lieu of the entire back half of his suit.

He also created the never-seen character of &quot;Lord Thames&quot;, supposedly the owner of Thames Television (the company was actually owned by two conglomerates). The character was often the butt of Everett&#x27;s rants and was said to symbolise his contempt for senior management at the company, claiming they lived behind an ancient, cobweb-covered door marked as the &quot;Office of Saying &#x27;No&#x27;&quot;. Thames never disciplined him for these comments, unlike prior employers such as the BBC.

The show ran for four series on ITV. The last episode of Series 3 ended with Everett giving a farewell speech as the set and scenery was being stripped down by the crew. The final shot before the closing credits was Everett himself being picked up and placed inside an oversized dustbin.

The fourth series was retitled &quot;The Kenny Everett Video Cassette&quot; and was more of a comedy programme than the previous three series, which relied more on music acts.

=== &quot;The Kenny Everett Television Show&quot; ===
Everett fell out with Thames regarding the management of his show, including the scheduling against the BBC&#x27;s top-rated &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on Thursday evenings. The BBC offered him a live-audience sketch-format comedy programme, starting with a Christmas special on BBC1 in 1981, followed by five primetime series between 1982 and 1988. The writing team was bolstered by the addition of Andrew Marshall, David Renwick and Neil Shand and the production standards were raised by the heavier investment from the corporation.

Thames Television claimed copyright on Everett&#x27;s characters and tried to prevent their use by the BBC. Although this action failed, it did lead to the creation of new characters such as General Cheeseburger whose monologues were seen as a satire on US foreign policy, agony aunt Verity Treacle, mime artist Maurice Mimer whose drawings turn into real objects, upper class socialite Jeremy Mince who was perpetually drunk on champagne, orange-haired punk Gizzard Puke (intended to replace Sid Snot) and the spooneristically named Cupid Stunt, a blonde glamorous American B-movie actress with pneumatic breasts. Played in full drag but with no attempt to disguise Everett&#x27;s beard, she told a cardboard cut-out of chat show host Michael Parkinson (and later Terry Wogan depicted as a skeleton in a suit) about her latest trashy film projects and lurid tales of life on set with male stars such as Burt Reynolds. Her final action in each sketch was to uncross her legs then swing them wildly to recross them (brazenly giving viewers an eyeful of her racy red lingerie) as she uttered the catchphrase &quot;It&#x27;s all done in the best &quot;possible taste&quot;!&quot; Inept TV handyman Reg Prescott became another firm viewers&#x27; favourite, as each week he managed to visibly injure himself with tools while attempting to demonstrate DIY tips. Revived characters from the previous series included Sid Snot, Marcel Wave, Brother Lee Love, Angry of Mayfair and the Constable. Each episode in season 3 featured a version of &quot;Snot Rap – Part II&quot; by one or more of Everett&#x27;s main characters.

Brazilian-born Cleo Rocos co-starred in the BBC series. She often appeared in nothing more than frilly underwear and high heels.

==Video==
In 1981, Everett, Cryer and Cameron teamed up with Brothers Music to target the emerging home video market with a VHS release called &quot;The Kenny Everett Naughty Joke Box&quot;, which was followed a year later by another Brothers Music VHS release called &quot;The New Kenny Everett Naughty Video&quot;. Produced and directed by co-writer Ray Cameron, this &#x27;too rude for television&#x27; production would get a nationwide Freeview broadcast under the name &quot;Kenny Everett Naughty Video&quot; by That&#x27;s TV in January 2022. The video was recorded with an audience (in-vision beside Everett for much of the time), while co-writer Barry Cryer has an on-screen role, appearing as a guest alongside Lionel Blair and Willie Rushton. Sheila Steafel, Cleo Rocos, Debbie Linden, Linda Lusardi and Jane Score also feature in the cast, while Nikolai Grishanovich turns up at the end to make a comment about the Soviet Union. Characters appearing in the video include Gizzard Puke, Marcel Wave, Sid Snot and a caricature of an Australian called Bris Troop, while the video has a running joke about people at a line of urinals.

==Film==

Everett made one foray into film with 1984&#x27;s &quot;Bloodbath at the House of Death&quot;, a spoof of contemporary horror films, which was penned by Everett&#x27;s usual writing partners Barry Cryer and Ray Cameron (who also directed the film). Vincent Price was featured as the villain, credited only as the &quot;Sinister Man&quot;, and a number of other popular comedians and actors also appeared, including Pamela Stephenson, Gareth Hunt and Don Warrington. Several regulars from Everett&#x27;s television series also appeared.

==Music==

Everett released three singles in the 1960s. In 1965 - a comedy collaboration with fellow Radio London DJ Dave Cash, &quot;The B Side&quot;//&quot;Knees&quot; (Decca Records). In 1968 a solo single, written by Harry Nilsson &quot;It&#x27;s Been So Long&quot; (MGM Records), and in 1969 &quot;Nice Time&quot; (Deram Records) which was used as the title theme for the second series of the Granada TV show. In 1977, Everett collaborated with Mike Vickers to release the single &quot;Captain Kremmen&quot;, using a previously published instrumental by Vickers, &quot;Retribution&quot; as its backing. It entered the UK charts on 12 November, and peaked at number 32 two weeks later.
In 1983 Kenny Everett released the single &quot;Snot Rap&quot;, ostensibly sung by two of his TV characters, Sid Snot and Cupid Stunt. This would peak at number 9 in the UK charts for the week ending 16 April, and peaked at number 91 in Australia. A sequel single, &quot;Snot Rap II (Rapping Again)&quot;, once again performed in character, was released in March 1985, but failed to chart.

==Personal life==
Everett married the singer and psychic Audrey &quot;Lady Lee&quot; Middleton at Kensington Register Office on 2 June 1969. By September 1979, they had separated, and he stopped publicly denying his homosexuality in the late 1980s. His co-host David Cash, in the documentary &quot;Unforgettable Kenny Everett&quot;, states that &quot;Once I got to know him socially off the ship, it was very obvious that his sexual tendencies were homosexual and he looked at it as bad and so he fought it all the way.&quot; One of his first boyfriends, a waiter called Dave Nealon, was a match found for Everett by his former wife. In 1985 after coming out, he introduced his &quot;two husbands&quot;—Nikolai Grishanovich and Pepe Flores—to the media; Everett contracted HIV from Grishanovich, who died of AIDS in 1991.

===Politics===
During the 1983 general election campaign, the Young Conservatives invited Everett to their conference in an attempt to attract the youth vote. Egged on by film director Michael Winner, Everett bounded onto the stage, wearing the enormously oversized foam rubber hands familiar from his mock-evangelical character Brother Lee Love. He shouted slogans such as &quot;Let&#x27;s bomb Russia!&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s kick Michael Foot&#x27;s stick away!&quot; to loud applause. (Michael Foot was the ageing leader of the Labour Party at the time, who used a walking stick.) Everett later said he regretted the appearance and said that he had taken the foam hands to the rally because the Tories &quot;asked me first&quot;.

In an interview on Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; with Gay Byrne and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor in February 1989, Everett was challenged by O&#x27;Connor about his support for the Conservative Party in the light of his homosexuality and the party&#x27;s Section 28 addition to the Local Government Act. Everett clarified that he was not a &quot;full Tory&quot;, but that he had been appalled by the actions of Arthur Scargill, whom he saw as &quot;inciting violence&quot; and &quot;rabble rousing&quot; and who he thought looked like &quot;Hitler reborn&quot;. He had consequently supported the actions of Margaret Thatcher in opposing Scargill. He said he would stand up for gay rights if he were asked providing &quot;it was a jolly occasion&quot;, but he also felt that being in a minority and in the public eye, he could do more for gay rights by showing that he was funny and human rather than by marching in the streets.

===Friendship with Freddie Mercury===

Everett became close friends with Freddie Mercury, the lead vocalist and pianist of Queen, after they met on Everett&#x27;s breakfast radio show on Capital Radio in 1974.

In 1988, Middleton, who had subsequently remarried actor John Alkin, published an autobiography with a foreword from Everett. After its publication and newspaper serialisation, however, Everett denounced the book for outing him. Mercury reportedly sided with Middleton. The fallout resulted in Middleton and Everett communicating only via their lawyers.

A year later, Everett and Mercury were reconciled when both were suffering with health issues due to complications with HIV. Mercury died in November 1991.

==Illness and death==
Everett was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1989 and he made his condition known to the public in 1993. He died from an AIDS-related illness on 4 April 1995, aged 50. 

A Catholic requiem mass was held at Church of the Immaculate Conception in Mayfair, London. His body was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium.

==Legacy==
In 1981 Everett co-wrote a semi-fictitious autobiography entitled &quot;The Custard Stops at Hatfield&quot;. It was published by Willow Books, an imprint of Collins, in September 1982.

In 1996, a compilation album entitled &quot;Kenny Everett at the Beeb&quot; was released as part of the &quot;BBC Radio Collection&quot; series of cassette tapes. The album, narrated by Barry Cryer, is a chronological look at Everett&#x27;s BBC Radio career that combines clips from his various series with interviews that he gave on programmes such as &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;.

Everett is the subject of a 1997 episode of the Thames Television series &quot;Heroes of Comedy&quot; which covers his life and career from his beginnings on pirate radio until his death. Celebrities such as Steve Wright, Cliff Richard, Cleo Rocos, Barry Cryer, Jeremy Beadle, Terry Wogan and Barry Took appear and talk about their experiences, collaborations and friendships with Everett and his influence on them.

On 18 November 2007, ITV1 broadcast a tribute show to Everett entitled &quot;Licence to Laugh&quot;. This celebrated the 30 years since he first appeared on ITV with the &quot;Kenny Everett Video Show&quot; (Thames Television). Friends and colleagues revealed what it was like to know and work with the man they affectionately dubbed &quot;Cuddly Ken&quot;. Additionally, contemporary celebrities such as Chris Moyles and Chris Tarrant talked about their love for the funny entertainer and discussed the ways in which Everett had influenced them and their work. It also featured archive footage.

The documentary &quot;When Freddie Mercury Met Kenny Everett&quot;, broadcast on Channel 4, tells the story of the relationship between the two men from the moment they met in 1974 when Mercury was a guest on Everett&#x27;s radio show, through lovers and drug-taking to when both died of AIDS. It features affectionate interviews by many people who were close to him.

In March 2010 the BBC confirmed that it was producing a 90-minute TV biographical film called &quot;Number One in Heaven&quot;, to be written by Tim Whitnall and focusing on Everett&#x27;s unhappiness at secondary school.

On 3 October 2012 the BBC broadcast a 90-minute TV biopic called &quot;The Best Possible Taste&quot; which focused on the performer&#x27;s relationship with his wife, singer Lee Middleton. Oliver Lansley played the part of Everett and Katherine Kelly that of Middleton.

In 2013, &quot;Hello Darlings! The Authorized Biography Of Kenny Everett&quot; written by James Hogg and Robert Sellers was published by Bantam Press.

Everett was portrayed by Dickie Beau in the 2018 Oscar-winning film &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, a biographical musical drama about the life of Freddie Mercury.

In December 2024, BBC Radio 4 Extra broadcast a week of programmes to mark what would have been Everett&#x27;s 80th birthday. It began with a documentary &quot;Kenny Everett: The BBC Local Radio Years&quot; and included some of Everett&#x27;s BBC Radio Bristol shows from 1971.

<doc id="256559" wikidata="Q276205" url="?curid=256559" title="Sheila Copps">
<text>Sheila Maureen Copps (born November 27, 1952) is a former Canadian politician who also served as the sixth deputy prime minister of Canada from November 4, 1993, to April 30, 1996, and June 19, 1996, to June 11, 1997. Her father, Victor Copps, was once mayor of Hamilton, Ontario.

Considered a prominent left-wing member of the Liberal Party of Canada, Copps was an advocate for legal rights of women, marijuana legalization, minority rights, and protection of the environment. Her combative style and reputation for flamboyance were trademarks of her political career.

== Early life ==
Copps was born in Hamilton, Ontario. She is a second-generation member of a political family that has dominated Hamilton-area politics on the municipal, provincial and federal levels. Her mother, Geraldine Florence (Guthro) Copps, was a Hamilton city councillor. Her father, Victor Kennedy Copps, was mayor of the City of Hamilton. She attended Bishop Ryan Catholic Secondary School. As a child, Copps participated in Girl Guides of Canada youth programs.

She is married to Austin Thorne (her third husband), and has one daughter, Danelle (from her second marriage). She was the first sitting Member of Parliament in Canadian history to give birth while a member.

Copps earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in French and English from King&#x27;s University College at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, and pursued further studies at McMaster University in Hamilton and the University of Rouen in France. She worked as a newspaper journalist with the &quot;Hamilton Spectator&quot; and the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;.

== Political career ==

Copps entered provincial politics in the 1977 provincial election, running for the Ontario Liberal Party in Hamilton Centre. She lost, finishing 14 votes behind incumbent New Democrat Mike Davison. Copps appeared on the ballot for this election as &quot;Sheila Copps Miller&quot;, using the surname of her then-husband. In all subsequent campaigns, she would refer to herself as &quot;Sheila Copps.&quot;

After working as a constituency assistant to party leader Stuart Smith for the next four years, Copps again ran in Hamilton Centre for the 1981 election. She defeated Davison by 2,804 votes, and joined thirty-three other Liberals in forming the Official Opposition to Premier William Davis&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government. Copps ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party in 1982 following Smith&#x27;s resignation, and despite her lack of experience finished second against David Peterson.

Copps turned to national politics in the 1984 federal election, campaigning for the federal Liberals in the riding of Hamilton East. This election resulted in a landslide victory for Brian Mulroney and his Progressive Conservative Party, which won 211 out of 282 seats. Copps was personally elected, defeating New Democratic Party candidate David Christopherson by 2,661 votes, but had relatively few allies in the House of Commons for the next four years.

Copps proved to be an influential member of the small Liberal opposition. She became a prominent member of the &quot;Rat Pack,&quot; a group of young Liberal MPs who made it their business to bring misery to the Mulroney government. Fully bilingual, she earned both praise and scorn for her spirited attacks on Mulroney and his ministers. She released her autobiography, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Baby&quot;, only two years into her federal career, and was by all accounts a rising star in Canadian politics. The book came after Minister of Justice John Crosbie told Copps to &quot;just quieten [sic] down, baby&quot; during a heated debate. Copps retorted, &quot;I am nobody&#x27;s baby.&quot;

In 1987, Copps became the first sitting MP in Canadian history to give birth, when her daughter Danelle was born. Later, Copps commented that she became part of her &quot;entourage,&quot; making friends across the country. In 1988, Copps was re-elected without difficulty in the federal election.

Copps was a candidate in the 1990 Liberal leadership race to succeed John Turner. She finished third, behind Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin.

In 1992, Copps supported Murray Elston&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to succeed David Peterson as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party.

=== Federal minister ===

The Liberals came to power in the 1993 election, defeating Kim Campbell&#x27;s Tories. Chrétien became prime minister following the election, and named Copps as deputy prime minister and minister of the environment. This marked the first time in Canadian history that a woman had been named to the post of deputy prime minister. Following a 1996 cabinet shuffle, she relinquished the Environment portfolio and became Minister of Canadian Heritage. Around this time, Copps participated in the 1994 class of the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Global Leaders of Tomorrow program alongside former Quebec Premier Jean Charest and World Bank natural gas leader Afsaneh Mashayekhi Beschloss.

Copps resigned briefly in the spring of 1996. One of Chrétien&#x27;s campaign promises had been to abolish Brian Mulroney&#x27;s highly unpopular Goods and Services Tax, a promise he later reneged on in an effort to avoid decreasing government revenues. During the 1993 election campaign, Copps promised during a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation &quot;town hall&quot; program that she would resign if the GST was not abolished. Copps, after some pressure, vacated her Hamilton East seat in 1996, and promptly ran again in the ensuing by-election.

During the by-election, Reform put up billboards around her riding, one featuring a pig at a trough with &quot;SHEILA&quot; marked on it; and another with her picture and, &quot;Promise to cut the GST: It worked last time!&quot; Copps won handily, though with a significantly reduced percentage of the vote from 1993, and Chrétien reinstated her to her previous cabinet posts. During her victory speech, she noted that the Liberals &quot;kicked butt&quot; in the by-election; a controversial editorial cartoon in the right-wing &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; tabloid the next day portrayed Hamilton East voters as &quot;buttheads.&quot;

Following the 1997 election, Copps was removed from the position of deputy prime minister, which was given to political stalwart Herb Gray. Copps made little upward progress in cabinet after this demotion, and by many accounts came to have relatively little influence over the direction of government policy. Many believe that Anne McLellan surpassed her as the most prominent woman in government during this period.

Following Jean Chrétien&#x27;s announcement of his intent to retire in February 2004, Copps became the first candidate to officially declare for the party leadership. Despite her efforts to build support among women, minority groups and the party&#x27;s left-wing, she began and ended the leadership contest well behind the overwhelming favourite, Paul Martin. While her national campaigning saw her sign up over 32,000 new party members, some speculated that she would withdraw prior to the Liberal leadership convention, as John Manley had.

=== Nomination battle before 2004 federal election ===

Riding redistribution placed Copps in a serious nomination battle with another Liberal MP, Tony Valeri, who was named to Martin&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Transport. With redistribution, part of Valeri&#x27;s Stoney Creek riding was merged with part of Copps&#x27;s Hamilton East to create Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, while the remainder was merged with other neighbouring ridings to create Niagara West—Glanbrook. The remaining portion of Hamilton East was merged with parts of Hamilton West to create Hamilton Centre. Of the 115,709 constituents of the riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek, a slight majority of constituents (58,462) were from the old Stoney Creek while a minority (57,247) were from the old Hamilton East

Copps&#x27;s position was that Valeri should have sought the nomination in Niagara West—Glanbrook, where he resided, and where there was a regional airport that would complement his transport portfolio. Valeri&#x27;s position was that the majority of his former Stoney Creek constituents lived in the new Hamilton East—Stoney Creek riding, Copps no longer lived in Hamilton and he resided less than 100 metres from the riding boundary.

In a December interview with Hamilton&#x27;s CHCH-TV, Copps complained that Martin was trying to drive her, other women and other Martin opponents out of the Liberal caucus. Beth Phinney, who represented nearby Hamilton Mountain, offered to stand down in favour of Copps, but Copps turned this offer down. On January 14, 2004, she suggested that she could campaign for the New Democratic Party in the upcoming election if Valeri won the Liberal nomination. Copps later retracted this threat.

On March 6, 2004, Valeri defeated Copps by 2,802 votes to 2,491. Copps argued that there were improprieties in the nomination process and in the conduct of the vote, and called on various authorities to investigate (other nomination elections between Chrétien and Martin supporters had similar allegations of tampering). She initially appealed the vote results to the Liberal Party of Canada. Her appeal was late as it was filed beyond the 72-hour deadline after the commencement of the nomination meeting, but the Appeals Commission of the Liberal Party waived the deadline. Nevertheless, Copps dropped the appeal on March 29, alleging a lack of transparency in the process.

In July 2005, Hamilton police announced a formal end to the investigation after finding no evidence to substantiate Copps&#x27;s allegations including tampering of her telephones on the day of the nomination. As the access codes to her phone system were apparently listed on a bulletin board, the police estimated that at least 40 individuals had access to the phone system.

== Post-political career ==

On May 14, 2004, Copps stood in the House of Commons of Canada and announced she would not run for re-election as an independent. She later suggested in comments to reporters that she might return to politics once Paul Martin was no longer prime minister. In her first public engagement after departing politics, she accepted a role in a Kingston, Ontario dinner theatre production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;. She also guest-starred on the evening soap opera &quot;Train 48&quot;.

Her second autobiography, &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot;, was published by McClelland and Stewart in October 2004 and resulted in further public controversy with Paul Martin and other members of the Liberal Party. Copps alleged that Martin had put a pledge in his 1995 budget to rescind the &quot;outdated&quot; Canada Health Act and further claimed that her intervention had the offending line removed from the document. Her allegations were denied by Martin and David Dodge (who Copps claims faxed her the draft of the budget), Diane Marleau (who was Health Minister at the time), and others.

After leaving politics, Copps wrote regular commentary for the &quot;National Post&quot;. In September 2005, concurrent with a redesign, she was introduced as a regular columnist for the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; and various &quot;Sun&quot; papers across Canada. Copps quit her column in December 2007.

She also hosted a weekly syndicated radio talk show, &quot;Weekends with Sheila Copps&quot;, focusing on lifestyle issues such as health and financial planning. She succeeded Dini Petty as host of the series.

In March 2006, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society of Montreal, a prominent sovereigntist group, demanded $100,000 from Copps, claiming that she had defamed them in a television interview on January 6, 2006. Sovereigntists claim that Options Canada illegally spent $3.5 million to promote federalism in Quebec, while Copps claimed that the St-Jean Baptiste Society spent $4.8 million from the Quebec Government to promote sovereignty, which the group denies. Copps claims that she had been unaware of the group&#x27;s demands until she was approached for comment by reporters on March 5, 2006, and that she has yet to receive any legal notice from the group.

In 2006, subsequent to Paul Martin&#x27;s resignation as prime minister, Copps decided not to seek the Liberal leadership.

Following the 2006 election, Liberal MP Paul Zed (Liberal, New Brunswick) and former MP Dennis Mills (Liberal, Ontario) organized a gala event to pay tribute to Copps and heal wounds caused by party infighting. Held on March 23, 2006, the event was attended by a host of prominent Liberals, including former Prime Minister John Turner and Aline Chrétien. The event also served as a fundraiser for Liberal women in Canadian politics.
As the daughter of late Hamilton Mayor Victor Copps, she has long been the object of speculation as to whether or not she would follow in the footsteps of her father, recently stating that, if she were to return to politics, she would do so &quot;it would be in my hometown and nowhere else.&quot;

Copps ran to be president of the Liberal Party of Canada in 2012 but lost to Mike Crawley by 26 votes. Following the defeat, Copps announced her retirement from politics stating that while she would continue to volunteer in political campaigns she would not be running for office again. She was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada on December 30, 2012.

On November 10, 2014, Copps stated that she has been sexually assaulted and raped and one of the incidents happened while she was serving in the Provincial Parliament of Ontario. She said she felt compelled to come forward with the allegations after tweeting support for former &quot;Q&quot; host Jian Ghomeshi.

On September 9, 2022, Copps endorsed former Ontario New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath for mayor of Hamilton. In the 2025 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, she endorsed Karina Gould.

===SNC-Lavalin affair===

At the height of the SNC-Lavalin affair during the Premiership of Justin Trudeau, Copps became known for being outspoken on the affair.

After Jody Wilson-Raybould and Jane Philpott resigned from their posts citing the government&#x27;s handling of the matter, Copps repeatedly publicly called for their &quot;firing&quot; in the form of dismissal from the Liberal caucus. Copps argued Wilson-Raybould and Philpott&#x27;s resignations amounted to a betrayal of Justin Trudeau&#x27;s leadership and their presence continued to foment internal political divisions within the Liberal caucus. Copps directly pointed the blame on Wilson-Raybould and Philpott for &quot;the public mud-dragging that you&#x27;ve taken the prime minister through.&quot;

Copps alleged that &quot;while they had policy experience, they lacked political experience&quot; and &quot;when you don’t have a lot of political experience, the pressure gets too hot for you [and] I think that pressure has probably gotten to them, unfortunately.&quot; Sought out by CBC News for commentary, she wrote in an email that both &quot;are doing their best to destroy their leader.&quot; Unprompted, Copps went as far as to say Wilson-Raybould and Philpott had &quot;gone rogue&quot; and were not &quot;wizened political people.&quot; She claimed without providing evidence that Wilson-Raybould “doesn&#x27;t really like to listen to other people, including the prime minister” and argued both she and Philpott were architects of their own victimization narrative being used for personal gain at the expense of the Prime Minister. Copps again disparaged Wilson-Raybould’s working relationship with her colleagues, alleging “[she] was running her own show, and nobody was going to tell her what to do anywhere.” Indigenous leaders argued the criticisms perpetuated colonial-era, sexist stereotypes that Indigenous women could not be powerful, forthright, and steadfast in positions of power, but rather confrontational, meddling and egotistic.

In a Twitter exchange with Jonathan Kay, Copps implied Wilson-Raybould’s conduct was one of a “bitch.” When concerns were raised that her diction made Indigenous issues sound menacing, Copps was &quot;baffled,&quot; since to her &quot;[the aboriginal agenda] only had positive connotations.” Another tweet saw Copps imply Jody Wilson-Raybould, a member of the We Wai Kai Nation, would have cared more about intervening in SNC-Lavalin’s prosecution had the 9000 jobs reportedly at stake in Quebec instead been 9000 jobs held by Aboriginal people. Copps later denied her implication that Wilson-Raybould was working for Indigenous communities more than the general public. When queried about the racial undertones behind her messaging and reasoning, Copps responded: &quot;Anybody who knows me knows I&#x27;m not a racist … there is a higher test for women, for minorities, for Indigenous people. For sure. Sadly, it&#x27;s not fair.&quot; When asked if her comment about Wilson-Raybould perpetuated that double standard, Copps said no, that she was rather simply commenting on the former minister&#x27;s background informing her choices.

Copps’s messages and conduct were condemned by a member of the Haudenosaunee First Nations Confederacy, NDP MP Romeo Saganash, Aboriginal rights activist Cindy Blackstock, and Conservative MP Gérard Deltell, among others.

<doc id="256560" wikidata="Q453181" url="?curid=256560" title="Brand management">
<text>In marketing, brand management is the control of how a brand is perceived in the market. Tangible elements of brand management include the look, price, and packaging of the product itself; intangible elements are the experiences that the target markets share with the brand, and the relationships they have with it. A brand manager would oversee all aspects of the consumer&#x27;s brand association as well as relationships with members of the supply chain. Developing a good relationship with target markets is essential for brand management.

==Definitions==
In 2001, Hislop defined branding as &quot;the process of creating a relationship or a connection between a company&#x27;s product and emotional perception of the customer for the purpose of generating segregation among competition and building loyalty among customers&quot;. In 2004 and 2008, Kapferer and Keller respectively defined it as a fulfillment in customer expectations and consistent customer satisfaction.

Brand management uses an array of marketing tools and techniques in order to increase the perceived value of a product (see: Brand equity). Based on the aims of the established marketing strategy, brand management enables the price of products to grow and builds loyal customers through positive associations and images or a strong awareness of the brand.

Brand management is the process of identifying the core value of a particular brand and reflecting the core value among the targeted customers. In modern terms, a brand could be corporate, product, service, or person. Brand management builds brand credibility and credible brands only, can build brand loyalty, bounce back from circumstantial crisis, and can benefit from price-sensitive customers.

==History==
The earliest origins of branding can be traced to pre-historic times. The practice may have first begun with the branding of farm animals in the middle East in the neolithic period. Stone Age and Bronze Age cave paintings depict images of branded cattle. Egyptian funerary artwork also depicts branded animals. Over time, the practice was extended to marking personal property such as pottery or tools, and eventually some type of brand or insignia was attached to goods intended for trade.

Around 4,000 years ago, producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer&#x27;s personal identity thus giving the product a personality. Bevan and Wengrow have argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient Mesopotamia in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Diana Twede has argued that the &quot;consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions&quot; (p. 107). She has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for purchasers during exchange. Systematic use of stamped labels dates appears to date from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings functioned as a brand, conveying information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality.

A number of archaeological research studies have found extensive evidence of branding, packaging and labelling in antiquity. Archaeologists have identified some 1,000 different Roman potters&#x27; marks of the early Roman Empire, suggesting that branding was a relatively widespread practice.

In Pompeii (circa 35 CE), Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as garum) was branding his amphora which travelled across the entire Mediterranean. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:
: 1. G(ari) F(los) SCO[m]/ SCAURI/ EX OFFI[ci]/NA SCAU/RI Translated as &quot;The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus, from the shop of Scaurus&quot;
: 2. LIQU[minis]/ FLOS Translated as: &quot;The flower of Liquamen&quot; 
: 3. G[ari] F[los] SCOM[bri]/ SCAURI Translated as: &quot;The flower of garum, made of the mackerel, a product of Scaurus&quot;
: 4. LIQUAMEN/ OPTIMUM/ EX OFFICI[n]/A SCAURI Translated as: &quot;The best liquamen, from the shop of Scaurus&quot;
Scauras&#x27; fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the Mediterranean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern France. Curtis has described this mosaic as &quot;an advertisement... and a rare, unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron, rather than by the artist&quot;.

In Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as &quot;Lassius&quot; and &quot;L. Eumachius;&quot; probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer&#x27;s name and other information including the use, price or intended recipient. These markings demonstrate the public&#x27;s need for product information in an increasingly complex marketplace.

In the East, evidence of branding also dates to an early period. Recent research suggests that Chinese merchants made extensive use of branding, packaging, advertising and retail signage. From as early as 200 BCE, Chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family, place names and product quality, and the use of government imposed product branding was used between 600 and 900 AD. Eckhart and Bengtsson have argued that during the Song dynasty (960–1127), Chinese society developed a consumerist culture, where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite (p. 212). The rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image, retail signage, symbolic brands, trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji, hao, lei, gongpin, piazi and pinpai, which roughly equate with Western concepts of family status, quality grading, and upholding traditional Chinese values (p. 219). Eckhardt and Bengtsson&#x27;s analysis suggests that brands emerged in China as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture, in which brands provide social status and stratification. Thus, the evolution of brands in China stands in sharp contrast to the West where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate, increase market share and ultimately profits (pp 218–219). In Japan, branding has a long heritage. For many Japanese businesses, a &quot;mon&quot; or seal is an East Asian form of brand or trademark.

Not all historians agree that the distinctive packages and markings used in antiquity can be compared with modern brands or labels. Moore and Reid, for example, have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed &quot;proto-brands&quot; rather than seen as modern brands according to our modern understanding. A proto-brand is one that possesses at least one of three characteristics; &quot;place&quot; – information about the origin of manufacture-expressed by a mark, signature or even by the physical properties of the raw materials including the packaging materials, &quot;performs a basic marketing function&quot; such as storage, transportation and assortment; and &quot;quality attributes&quot;- information about the product&#x27;s quality expressed by the name of the manufacturer, place of origin or ingredients or any other generally accepted indicator of quality.

The impetus for more widespread branding was often provided by government laws, requiring producers to meet minimum quality specifications or to standardize weights and measures, which in turn, was driven by public concerns about quality and fairness in exchange. The use of hallmarks, applied to precious metal objects, was well in place by the 4th century CE in Byzantium. Evidence of marked silver bars dates to around 350 CE, and represents one of the oldest known forms of consumer protection. Hundreds of silver objects, including chalices, cups, plates, rings and bullion, all bearing hallmarks from the early Byzantine period, have been found and documented. Hallmarks for silver and gold were introduced in Britain in 1300.

In medieval Europe, branding was applied to a broader range of goods and services. Craft guilds, which sprang up across Europe around this time, codified and reinforced systems of marking products to ensure quality and standards. Bread-makers, silversmiths and goldsmiths all marked their wares during this period. By 1266, English bakers were required by law to put a symbol on each product they sold. Bricui et al. have argued that the number of different forms of brands blossomed from the 14th century following the period of European discovery and expansion. Some individual brand marks have been in continuous use for centuries. The brand Staffelter Hof, for example, dates to 862 or earlier and the company still produces wine under its name today.

The granting a royal charter to tradesmen, markets and fairs was practiced across Europe from the early medieval period. At a time when concerns about product quality were major public issues, a royal endorsement provided the public with a signal that the holder supplied goods worthy of use in the royal household, and by implication inspired public confidence. In the 15th century, a &quot;royal warrant of appointment&quot; replaced the royal charter in England. The Lord Chamberlain of England formally appointed tradespeople as suppliers to the royal household. The printer William Caxton, for example, was one of the earliest recipients of a royal warrant when he became the King&#x27;s printer in 1476. By the 18th century, mass-market manufacturers such as Josiah Wedgewood and Matthew Boulton recognized the value of supplying royalty, often at prices well below cost, for the sake of the publicity and kudos it generated. Many manufacturers began actively displaying the royal arms on their premises, packaging and labelling. By 1840, the rules surrounding the display of royal arms were tightened to prevent fraudulent claims. By the early 19th century, the number of royal warrants granted rose rapidly when Queen Victoria granted some 2,000 royal warrants during her reign of 64 years.

By the eighteenth century, as standards of living improved and an emerging middle class began to demand more luxury goods and services, the retail landscape underwent major changes. Retailers were tending to specialize in specific goods or services and began to exhibit a variety of modern marketing techniques. Stores not only began to brand themselves, but also displayed branded goods, both in the glazed shop windows to attract passers-by and display counters to appeal to patrons inside the store. Branding was more widely used in the 19th century, following the industrial revolution, and the development of new professions like marketing, manufacturing and business management formalized the study of brands and branding as a key business activity. Branding is a way of differentiating product from mere commodities, and therefore the use of branding expanded with each advance in transportation, communication, and trade. The modern discipline of brand management is considered to have been started by a memo at Procter &amp; Gamble by Neil H. McElroy.

With the rise of mass media in the early 20th century, companies soon adopted techniques that would allow their advertising messages to stand out; slogans, mascots, and jingles began to appear on radio in the 1920s and early television in the 1930s. Many of the earliest radio drama series were sponsored by soap manufacturers and the genre became known as a &quot;soap opera.&quot; Before long, radio station owners realized they could increase advertising revenue by selling &#x27;air-time&#x27; in small time allocations which could be sold to multiple businesses. By the 1930s, these &quot;advertising spots,&quot; as the packets of time became known, were being sold by the station&#x27;s geographical sales representatives, ushering in an era of national radio advertising.

From the first decades of the 20th century, advertisers began to focus on developing brand personality, brand image and brand identity—concepts. The British advertising agency W. S. Crawford&#x27;s Ltd began to use the concept of &#x27;product personality&#x27; and the &#x27;advertising idea&#x27; arguing that in order to stimulate sales and create a &#x27;buying habit&#x27;, advertising had to &#x27;build a definitive association of ideas round the goods&#x27;. In the United States, advertising agency J. Walter Thompson company (JWT) was pioneering similar concepts of brand personality and brand image. The notion of a &#x27;brand personality&#x27; was developed independently and simultaneously in both the United States and Britain. For example, in 1915 JWT acquired the advertising account for Lux soap and recommended that the traditional positioning as a product for woolen garments should be broadened so that consumers would see it as a soap for use on all fine fabrics in the household. To implement, Lux was repositioned with a more up-market posture, and began a long association with expensive clothing and high fashion. Cano has argued that the positioning strategy JWT used for Lux exhibited an insightful understanding of the way that consumers mentally construct brand images. JWT recognized that advertising effectively manipulated socially shared symbols. In the case of Lux, the brand disconnected from images of household drudgery, and connected with images of leisure and fashion.

By the 1940s, manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers were developing relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense. Advertisers began to use motivational research and consumer research to gather insights into consumer purchasing. Strong branded campaigns for Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn research methods from psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th century. Esso&#x27;s &quot;Put a Tiger in Your Tank&quot; campaign was based on a tiger mascot used in Scandinavia at the turn of last century, and first appeared as a global advertising slogan in the 1950s and 1960s, and subsequently reappeared in the 1990s. Throughout the late 20th century, brand advertisers began to imbue goods and services with a personality, based on the insight that consumers searched for brands with personalities that matched their own.

==Global brands==

Interbrand&#x27;s 2020 top-10 global brands are Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Coca-Cola, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, McDonald&#x27;s, and Disney.
The split between commodities/food services and technology is not a matter of chance: both industrial sectors rely heavily on sales to the individual consumer who must be able to rely on cleanliness/quality or reliability/value, respectively. For this reason, industries such as agricultural (which sells to other companies in the food sector), student loans (which have a relationship with universities/schools rather than the individual loan-taker), and electricity (which is generally a controlled monopoly) have less prominent and less recognized branding. Brand value, moreover, is not simply a fuzzy feeling of &quot;consumer appeal&quot;, but an actual quantitative value of good will under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Companies will rigorously defend their brand name, including prosecution of trademark infringement. Occasionally trademarks may differ across countries.

Among the most highly visible and recognizable brands is the script and logo for Coca-Cola products. Despite numerous blind tests indicating that Coke&#x27;s flavor is not preferred, Coca-Cola continues to enjoy a dominant share of the cola market. Coca-Cola&#x27;s history is so replete with uncertainty that a folklore has sprung up around the brand, including the (refuted) myth that Coca-Cola invented the red-dressed Santa-Claus which is used to gain market entry in less capitalistic regions in the world such as the former Soviet Union and China, and such brand-management stories as &quot;Coca-Cola&#x27;s first entry into the Chinese market resulted in their brand being translated as &#x27;bite the wax tadpole&#x27;&quot;. Brand management science is replete with such stories, including the Chevrolet &#x27;Nova&#x27; or &quot;it doesn&#x27;t go&quot; in Spanish, and proper cultural translation is useful to companies entering new markets.

Modern brand management also intersects with legal issues such as &#x27;genericization of trademark.&#x27; The &#x27;Xerox&#x27; Company continues to fight heavily in media whenever a reporter or other writer uses &#x27;xerox&#x27; as simply a synonym for &#x27;photocopy.&#x27; Should usage of &#x27;xerox&#x27; be accepted as the standard American English term for &#x27;photocopy,&#x27; then Xerox&#x27;s competitors could successfully argue in court that they are permitted to create &#x27;xerox&#x27; machines as well. Yet, in a sense, reaching this stage of market domination is itself a triumph of brand management, in that becoming so dominant typically involves strong profit.

==Branding terminology==

Brand attitude refers to the &quot;buyer&#x27;s overall evaluation of a brand with respect to its perceived ability to meet a currently relevant motivation&quot;.

Brand associations refers to a set of information nodes held in memory that form a network of associations and are linked to a key variable. For example, variables such as &quot;brand image, brand personality, brand attitude, brand preference&quot; are nodes within a network that describes the sources of &quot;brand-self congruity.&quot; In another example, the variables &quot;brand recognition&quot; and &quot;brand recall&quot; form a linked network that describes the consumer&#x27;s &quot;brand awareness&quot; or &quot;brand knowledge.&quot;

Brand awareness refers to the extent to which consumers can identify a brand under various conditions. Marketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely &quot;brand recognition&quot; and &quot;brand recall.&quot; Brand recognition refers to how easily the consumers can associate a brand based on the company&#x27;s logo, slogan, color scheme, or other visual element, without seeing the company&#x27;s name.

Brand collaborations refer to the short-lived or ephemeral &quot;partnerships between brands in which their images, legacies and values intertwine.&quot;p.13 Brand collaborations can be unconventional when brands partner with other brands or designers seemingly on the opposite spectrum in terms of design, esthetics, positioning and values.

Brand equity Within the literature, it is possible to identify two distinct definitions of brand equity. Firstly an accounting definition suggests that brand equity is a measure of the financial value of a brand and attempts to measure the net additional inflows as a result of the brand or the value of the intangible asset of the brand. A different definition comes from marketing where brand equity is treated as a measure of the strength of consumers&#x27; attachment to a brand; a description of the associations and beliefs the consumer has about the brand.

Brand image refers to an image an organization wants to project; a psychological meaning or meaning profile associated with a brand.

Brand loyalty refers to the feelings of attachment a consumer forms with a brand. It is a tendency of consumers to purchase repeatedly from a specific brand.

Brand personality refers to &quot;the set of human personality traits that are both applicable to and relevant for brands&quot;.

Brand preference refers to &quot;consumers&#x27; predisposition towards certain brands that summarize their cognitive information processing towards brand stimuli&quot;.

Brand trust refers to whether customers expect the brand to do what is right. 81% of consumers from different markets identified this as a deciding factor in their purchases.

Self-brand congruity draws on the notion that consumers prefer brands with personalities that are congruent with their own; consumers tend to form strong attachments with brands where the brand personality matches their own.

==Brand orientation==
Brand orientation refers to &quot;the degree to which the organization values brands and its practices are oriented towards building brand capabilities&quot;. It is a deliberate approach to working with brands, both internally and externally. The most important driving force behind this increased interest in strong brands is the accelerating pace of globalization. This has resulted in an ever-tougher competitive situation on many markets. A product&#x27;s superiority is in itself no longer sufficient to guarantee its success. The fast pace of technological development and the increased speed with which imitations turn up on the market have dramatically shortened product lifecycles. The consequence is that product-related competitive advantages soon risk being transformed into competitive prerequisites. For this reason, increasing numbers of companies are looking for other, more enduring, competitive tools – such as brands.

==Justification==
Brand management aims to create an emotional connection between products, companies and their customers and constituents. Brand managers &amp; Marketing managers may try to control the brand image.

Brand managers create strategies to convert a suspect to prospect, prospect to buyer, buyer to customer, and customer to brand advocates.

==Approaches==

&quot;By Appointment to His Royal Majesty&quot; was a registered and limited list of approved brands suitable for supply to the British royal family.

Some believe brand managers can be counter-productive, due to their short-term focus.

On the other end of the extreme, luxury and high-end premium brands may create advertisements or sponsor teams merely for the &quot;overall feeling&quot; or goodwill generated. A typical &quot;no-brand&quot; advertisement might simply put up the price (and indeed, brand managers may patrol retail outlets for using their name in discount/clearance sales), whereas on the other end of the extreme a perfume brand might be created that does not show the actual use of the perfume or Breitling may sponsor an aerobatics team purely for the &quot;image&quot; created by such sponsorship. Space travel and brand management for this reason also enjoys a special relationship.

&quot;Nation branding&quot; is a modern term conflating foreign relations and the idea of a brand. An example is Cool Britannia of the 1990s.

==Social media==

Even though social media has changed the tactics of marketing brands, its primary goals remain the same; to attract and retain customers. However, companies have now experienced a new challenge with the introduction of social media. This change is finding the right balance between empowering customers to spread the word about the brand through viral platforms, while still controlling the company&#x27;s own core strategic marketing goals. Word-of-mouth marketing via social media, falls under the category of viral marketing, which broadly describes any strategy that encourages individuals to propagate a message, thus, creating the potential for exponential growth in the message&#x27;s exposure and influence. Basic forms of this are seen when a customer makes a statement about a product or company or endorses a brand. This marketing technique allows users to spread the word on the brand which creates exposure for the company. Because of this, brands have become interested in exploring or using social media for commercial benefit.

==Brand heritage==

Brands with heritage are not simply associated with antiquated organizations; rather, they actively extol values and position themselves in relation to their heritage. Brands offer multiple benefits to organizations at various market levels, reflecting the entire experiential process afforded to consumers. In the case of voluntary organizations if they can unlock their brand heritage and it will improve volunteer engagement, to the extent that organizations &#x27;with a long history, core values, positive track record, and use of symbols possess, whether consciously or not, an inherent advantage in an increasingly competitive landscape&#x27;. In the luxury literature, heritage is distinctly recognized as an integral component of a luxury brand&#x27;s identity. In the context of tourism preconceived notions of brand heritage stimulate the increased experience of existential authenticity, increasing satisfaction with the visitor experience. For consumer goods the communication of continuity of the brand promise can increase perceived brand authenticity. Heritage brands are characterized by their distinctive capacity to seamlessly integrate past, present, and future temporal dimensions.

<text>Pedro Nolasco Martín José María de la Candelaria Francisco Javier Ampudia y Grimarest (January 30, 1805 – August 7, 1868) was born in Havana, Cuba, and served Mexico as a Northern army officer for most of his life. At various points he was the governor of Tabasco, Yucatán, and Nuevo León. He also served a short term as Secretary of National Defense under President Benito Juárez.

Ampudia began his career in the Spanish army, and emigrated to Mexico following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1836, Ampudia served with the Mexican artillery at the Siege of the Alamo and later saw heavy combat at the Battle of San Jacinto. During border skirmishes with Texas in the early 1840s, Ampudia commanded the 350-man garrison of Ciudad Mier which was attacked on December 26, 1842, by Texan militia. In a bloody two-day battle, over 600 Mexicans were killed but they eventually forced the enemy to surrender, earning the grudging respect of the Texans across the border.

Briefly appointed as commander-in-chief of the Mexican &quot;Army of the North&quot; in 1846, Ampudia was removed from command following the brutal public execution of a local guerrilla leader on his personal orders. As a &quot;conservador&quot; (a member of Mexico&#x27;s conservative faction), Ampudia was quickly relegated to a staff position in favor of his &quot;liberal&quot; rival, General Mariano Arista. At the Battle of Palo Alto, Ampudia harshly criticized Arista for what he saw as &quot;unacceptable tactical blunders&quot; and continued his criticism at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma – a defeat for which Arista partially blamed him.

During the long retreat south, Ampudia was appointed commander-in-chief of the &quot;Army of the North,&quot; in time to command Mexican forces at the Battle of Monterrey. Despite orders from Antonio López de Santa Anna that he was to retreat to Saltillo, Ampudia chose to stand at Monterrey instead and informed Santa Anna that:

:&quot;The men will brook no further retreat in the face of the enemy.&quot;

After a skilled defense of the city, Ampudia found American forces entered from the west and east. Trapped in the city plaza and bombarded by U.S. forces with howitzers, general Ampudia chose to request a flag of truce and retreat his battered army. His arrangement with Zachary Taylor allowed the &quot;Army of the North&quot; to keep its weapons but march as far south as possible and neglect offensive operations for three months. At Saltillo, Ampudia attempted to throw up a defense similar to that at Monterrey, but the inhabitants of the city would have none of it. His failure to defend that city led to his removal by Santa Anna, and like his former superior, Arista, Ampudia found himself spending most of the rest of the war in administrative duties, though he was in command of portions of the Mexican artillery at the Battle of Buena Vista in 1847.

Despite his controversial retreat at Monterrey, Ampudia remained popular in Mexican folklore as &quot;the only man who could defeat Taylor.&quot; After the war, Ampudia&#x27;s policies became gradually more liberal, so that he supported the government of Benito Juárez during the Maximillian Intervention and served with considerable bravery and skill as commander of the liberal &quot;Army of the East&quot;, in whose command he was gravely wounded. In 1868, Ampudia died (possibly from complications arising from his wartime injuries) and was buried in the Panteón de San Fernando.

<doc id="256566" wikidata="Q2547397" url="?curid=256566" title="The Comics Journal">
<text>The Comics Journal, often abbreviated TCJ, is an American magazine of news and criticism pertaining to comic books, comic strips and graphic novels. Known for its lengthy interviews with comic creators, pointed editorials and scathing reviews of the products of the mainstream comics industry, the magazine promotes the view that comics are a fine art, meriting broader cultural respect, and thus should be evaluated with higher critical standards.

== History ==
In 1976, Gary Groth and Michael Catron acquired &quot;The Nostalgia Journal&quot;, a small competitor of the newspaper adzine &quot;The Buyer&#x27;s Guide for Comics Fandom&quot;. At the time, Groth and Catron were already publishing &quot;Sounds Fine&quot;, a similarly formatted adzine for record collectors that they had started after producing Rock &#x27;N Roll Expo &#x27;75, held during the July 4 weekend in 1975 in Washington, D.C.

The publication was relaunched as &quot;The New Nostalgia Journal&quot; with issue No. 27 (July 1976), and with issue No. 32 (January 1977), it became &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; (&quot;a quality publication for the serious comics fan&quot;). Issue No. 37 (December 1977) adopted a magazine format. With issue #45 (March 1979), the magazine moved to a monthly schedule; at that point it had a circulation of 10,000.

In addition to lengthy interviews with comics industry figures, the &quot;Journal&quot; has always published criticism—and received it in turn. Starting in the early 2000s, the &quot;Journal&quot; published a series of annual specials combining its usual critical format with extended samples of comics from specially selected contributors.

With issue No. 300 (November 2009), &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; ceased its semi-monthly print publication. &quot;TCJ&quot; shifted from an eight-times a year publishing schedule to a larger, more elaborate, semi-annual format supported by a new website. This format lasted until 2013 with issue #302. The print magazine then went on hiatus, returning to a magazine format in 2019 with issue #303.

=== Lawsuits ===
Over the years &quot;The Journal&quot; has been involved in a handful of lawsuits. Artist Rich Buckler attempted legal action for a review that called him a plagiarist while printing his panels next to earlier and quite similar Jack Kirby art. A Groth interview with science fiction writer Harlan Ellison sparked a lawsuit by writer Michael Fleisher over an informal discussion of Fleisher&#x27;s work and temperament. Co-defendants Groth and Ellison won the case, but emerged from the suit estranged.

Ellison later became a plaintiff against &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, filing suit in part to enjoin &quot;The Comics Journal Library: The Writers&quot;, a 2006 Fantagraphics book that reprinted the Ellison interview, and which used a cover blurb calling Ellison a &quot;Famous Comics Dilettante&quot;. That case was ultimately settled, with Fantagraphics agreeing to omit both the blurb and the interview from any future printings of the book, Ellison agreeing to post a Groth rebuttal statement on Ellison&#x27;s webpage, and both sides agreeing to avoid future &quot;ad hominem attacks&quot;.

The &quot;Journal&quot; has on occasion published, as cover features, lengthy court transcripts of comics-related civil suits. Notable instances include the Fleisher suit and Marv Wolfman&#x27;s failed suit against Marvel Comics over ownership of the character Blade.

== Content ==
&quot;The Journal&quot; features critical essays, articles on comics history and lengthy interviews, conducted by Gary Groth and others. Noteworthy interviews include Gil Kane in No. 38, Steve Gerber in No. 41, Harlan Ellison in No. 53, Dennis O&#x27;Neil in No. 64, Robert Crumb in No. 113, and Charles M. Schulz in #200.

According to Rick Cusick, writing in &quot;Gauntlet&quot; magazine, the &quot;Journal&quot;″s combination of forthright news coverage and critical analysis – although the norm for traditional journalistic enterprises – was in sharp contrast to the affectionate and promotional methods of publications like &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; and (later) &quot;Wizard&quot;. In 1995, publisher Gary Groth joked that his magazine occupied &quot;a niche that nobody wants&quot;.

== Staff members and regular contributors ==
Gary Groth has been the &quot;Journal&quot;″s publisher and nominal editor for almost all of its existence. Staff members and regular contributors have included Kim Thompson, Greg Stump, Eric Millikin, Eric Reynolds, Ng Suat Tong, R. Fiore, R.C. Harvey, Kenneth Smith, Don Phelps, Robert Boyd, Tom Heintjes, Michael Dean, Tom Spurgeon, Robert Rodi, Gene Phillips, Marilyn Bethke, Cat Yronwode, Heidi MacDonald, Lee Wochner, Bhob Stewart, Arn Saba, Ted White, Bob Levin, Carter Scholz, and Noah Berlatsky.

== The &quot;Journal&quot;″s Top 100 Comics list ==
The &quot;Journal&quot; published a 20th-century comics canon in its 210th issue (February 1999). To compile the list, eight contributors and editors made eight separate top 100 (or fewer than 100 for some) lists of American works. These eight lists were then informally combined and tweaked into an ordered list. &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; topped the list, followed by &quot;Peanuts&quot;, &quot;Pogo&quot;, and Art Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot;. Harvey Kurtzman had the most entries of any creator, five: his original run on &quot;Mad&quot; (#8), his &quot;New Trend&quot; EC war comics (#12), the 1959 &quot;Jungle Book&quot; graphic novel (#26), his &quot;Hey Look!&quot; gag cartoons (#63), and the &quot;Goodman Beaver&quot; stories (#64).

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; cited the survey&#x27;s ad hoc criteria:
Among the controversial omissions to the Top 100 was Dave Sim&#x27;s &quot;Cerebus&quot; series. Sim and the &quot;Journal&quot; had periodically found themselves at odds in the years preceding the list&#x27;s formulation. Issue #213 included eight pages of responses to, and defenses of the list; &quot;Journal&quot; columnist R. Fiore wrote &quot;Dave Sim must now think you have a personal vendetta against him&quot;, and co-publisher Kim Thompson conceded: &quot;If I had to do it over again, I&#x27;d squash together the Hernandez material into two entries [and] put &quot;Cerebus&quot; and two other things in the vacant spots&quot;. Twelve years later, the omission was still being acknowledged by the &quot;Journal&quot;, which noted that Dave Sim&#x27;s &quot;Cerebus&quot; &quot;was conspicuously excluded&quot;.

Regarding the inclusion of superhero comics on the list, editor and survey participant Tom Spurgeon wrote: &quot;I voted for most of the men-in-spandex titles that made the list – &quot;Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Plastic Man&quot; – despite the sheer lousiness of some of those works&#x27; contributing elements&quot;. Ultimately, the Top 100 included six superhero works, including the deconstructionist &quot;Watchmen&quot;. Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; was one well-regarded mainstream superhero project that was considered but ultimately not chosen, according to co-publisher Kim Thompson.

<text>The Magellan spacecraft was a robotic space probe launched by NASA on May 4, 1989. Its mission objectives were to map the surface of Venus by using synthetic-aperture radar and to measure the planetary gravitational field.

The &quot;Magellan&quot; probe was the first interplanetary mission to be launched from the Space Shuttle, the first one to use the Inertial Upper Stage booster, and the first spacecraft to test aerobraking as a method for circularizing its orbit. &quot;Magellan&quot; was the fifth successful NASA mission to Venus, and it ended an eleven-year gap in U.S. interplanetary probe launches.

==History==
Beginning in the late 1970s, scientists advocated for a radar mapping mission to Venus. They first sought to construct a spacecraft named the &quot;Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar&quot; (VOIR), but it became clear that the mission would be beyond the budget constraints during the ensuing years. The VOIR mission was canceled in 1982.

A simplified radar mission proposal was recommended by the Solar System Exploration Committee, and this one was submitted and accepted as the Venus Radar Mapper program in 1983. The proposal included a limited focus and a single primary scientific instrument. In 1985, the mission was renamed &quot;Magellan&quot;, in honor of the sixteenth-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, known for his exploration, mapping, and circumnavigation of the Earth.

The objectives of the mission included:
* Obtain near-global radar images of the Venusian surface with a resolution equivalent to optical imaging of per line pair. (&quot;primary&quot;)
* Obtain a near-global topographic map with spatial and vertical resolution.
* Obtain near-global gravity field data with resolution and two to three milligals of accuracy.
* Develop an understanding of the geological structure of the planet, including its density distribution and dynamics.

==Spacecraft design==

The spacecraft was designed and built by the Martin Marietta Company, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) managed the mission for NASA. Elizabeth Beyer served as the program manager and Joseph Boyce served as the lead program scientist for the NASA headquarters. For JPL, Douglas Griffith served as the &quot;Magellan&quot; project manager and R. Stephen Saunders served as the lead project scientist. Hughes Aircraft Company&#x27;s Space and Communications Group designed and built the spacecraft&#x27;s synthetic aperture radar.

To save costs, most of the &quot;Magellan&quot; probe was made up of flight spare parts and reused design elements from other spacecraft:

;Reuse Type Legend: 
The main body of the spacecraft, a spare one from the Voyager missions, was a 10-sided aluminum bus, containing the computers, data recorders, and other subsystems. The spacecraft measured 6.4 meters tall and 4.6 meters in diameter. Overall, the spacecraft weighed 3,445 kilograms.

===Attitude control and propulsion===

The spacecraft&#x27;s attitude control (orientation) was designed to be three-axis stabilized, including during the firing of the Star 48B solid rocket motor (SRM) used to place it into orbit around Venus. Prior to &quot;Magellan&quot;, all spacecraft SRM firings had involved spinning spacecraft, which made control of the SRM a much easier task. In a typical spin mode, any unwanted forces related to SRM or nozzle mis-alignments are cancelled out. In the case of &quot;Magellan&quot;, the spacecraft design did not lend itself to spinning, so the resulting propulsion system design had to accommodate the challenging control issues with the large Star 48B SRM. The Star 48B, containing 2,014 kg of solid propellant, developed a thrust of ~89 kN (20,000 lbf) shortly after firing; therefore, even a 0.5% SRM alignment error could generate side forces of 445 N (100 lbf). Final conservative estimates of worst-case side forces resulted in the need for eight 445 N thrusters, two in each quadrant, located out on booms at the maximum radius that the Space Shuttle Orbiter Payload Bay would accommodate (4.4-m or 14.5-ft diameter).

The actual propulsion system design consisted of a total of 24 monopropellant hydrazine thrusters fed from a single 71cm (28 in) diameter titanium tank. The tank contained 133 kg (293 lb) of purified hydrazine. The design also included a pyrotechnically-isolated external high pressure tank with additional helium that could be connected to the main tank prior to the critical Venus orbit insertion burn to ensure maximum thrust from the 445 N thrusters during the SRM firing. Other hardware regarding orientation of the spacecraft consists of a set of gyroscopes and a star scanner.

===Communications===

For communications, the spacecraft included a lightweight graphite/aluminum, 3.7-meter high-gain antenna left over from the Voyager Program and a medium-gain antenna spare from the Mariner 9 mission. A low-gain antenna attached to the high-gain antenna was also included for contingencies. When communicating with the Deep Space Network, the spacecraft was able to simultaneously receive commands at 1.2 kilobits/second in the S-band and transmit data at 268.8 kilobits/second in the X-band.

===Power===
&quot;Magellan&quot; was powered by two square solar arrays, each measuring 2.5 meters across. Together, the arrays supplied 1,200 watts of power at the beginning of the mission. However, over the course of the mission the solar arrays gradually degraded due to frequent, extreme temperature changes. To power the spacecraft while occulted from the Sun, twin 30 amp-hour, 26-cell, nickel-cadmium batteries were included. The batteries recharged as the spacecraft received direct sunlight.

===Computers and data processing===
The computing system on the spacecraft was partially modified equipment from the &quot;Galileo&quot;. There were two ATAC-16 computers forming one redundant system, located in the attitude-control subsystem, and four RCA 1802 microprocessors, as two redundant systems, to control the command and data subsystem (CDS). The CDS was able to store commands for up to three days, and also to autonomously control the spacecraft if problems were to arise while mission operators were not in contact with the spacecraft.

For storing the commands and recorded data, the spacecraft also included two multitrack digital tape recorders, able to store up to 225 megabytes of data until contact with the Earth was restored and the tapes were played back.

===Scientific instruments===

Thick and opaque, the atmosphere of Venus required a method beyond optical survey, to map the surface of the planet. The resolution of conventional radar depends entirely on the size of the antenna, which is greatly restricted by costs, physical constraints by launch vehicles and the complexity of maneuvering a large apparatus to provide high resolution data. &quot;Magellan&quot; addressed this problem by using a method known as synthetic aperture, where a large antenna is imitated by processing the information gathered by ground computers.

The &quot;Magellan&quot; high-gain parabolic antenna, oriented 28°–78° to the right or left of nadir, emitted thousands of microwave pulses per second that passed through the clouds and to the surface of Venus, illuminating a swath of land. The Radar System then recorded the brightness of each pulse as it reflected back off the side surfaces of rocks, cliffs, volcanoes and other geologic features, as a form of backscatter. To increase the imaging resolution, &quot;Magellan&quot; recorded a series of data bursts for a particular location during multiple instances called, &quot;looks&quot;. Each &quot;look&quot; slightly overlapped the previous, returning slightly different information for the same location, as the spacecraft moved in orbit. After transmitting the data back to Earth, Doppler modeling was used to take the overlapping &quot;looks&quot; and combine them into a continuous, high resolution image of the surface.

; Radar System (RDRS)
The Radar System functioned in three modes: synthetic aperture radar (SAR), altimetry (ALT), and radiometry (RAD). The instrument cycled through the three modes while observing the surface geology, topography, and temperature of Venus using the 3.7-meter parabolic, high-gain antenna and a small fan-beam antenna, located just to the side.

– In the &quot;Synthetic Aperture Radar&quot; mode, the instrument transmitted several thousand long-wave, 12.6-centimeter microwave pulses every second through the high-gain antenna, while measuring the doppler shift of each hitting the surface.
– In &quot;Altimetry&quot; mode, the instrument interleaved pulses with SAR, and operating similarly with the altimetric antenna, recording information regarding the elevation of the surface on Venus.
– In &quot;Radiometry&quot; mode, the high-gain antenna was used to record microwave radiothermal emissions from Venus. This data was used to characterize the surface temperature.

The data was collected at 750 kilobits/second to the tape recorder and later transmitted to Earth (10Bit per second*365*4*24*60=21Mbit (maximum) = 85Foto (maximum) ) to be processed into usable images, by the Radar Data Processing Subsystem (RDPS), a collection of ground computers operated by JPL.

===Other science===
In addition to the radar data, Magellan collected several other types of scientific measurements. These included detailed measurements of the Venus gravitational field, measurements of the atmospheric density, and radio occultation data on the atmospheric profile.

==Mission profile==
===Launch and trajectory===

&quot;Magellan&quot; was launched on May 4, 1989, at 18:46:59 UTC by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from KSC Launch Complex 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; during mission STS-30. Once in orbit, the &quot;Magellan&quot; and its attached Inertial Upper Stage booster were deployed from &quot;Atlantis&quot; and launched on May 5, 1989 01:06:00 UTC, sending the spacecraft into a Type IV heliocentric orbit where it would circle the Sun 1.5 times, before reaching Venus 15 months later on August 10, 1990.

Originally, the &quot;Magellan&quot; had been scheduled for launch in 1988 with a trajectory lasting six months. However, due to the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986, several missions, including &quot;Galileo&quot; and &quot;Magellan&quot;, were deferred until shuttle flights resumed in September 1988. &quot;Magellan&quot; was planned to be launched with a liquid-fueled, Centaur G upper-stage booster, carried in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle. However, the entire Centaur G program was canceled after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, and the &quot;Magellan&quot; probe had to be modified to be attached to the less-powerful Inertial Upper Stage. The next best opportunity for launching occurred in October 1989.

Further complicating the launch however, was the launching of the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission to Jupiter, one that included a fly-by of Venus. Intended for launch in 1986, the pressures to ensure a launch for &quot;Galileo&quot; in 1989, mixed with a short launch-window necessitating a mid-October launch, resulted in replanning the &quot;Magellan&quot; mission. Wary of rapid shuttle launches, the decision was made to launch &quot;Magellan&quot; in May, and into an orbit that would require one year, three months, before encountering Venus.


===Orbital encounter of Venus===

On August 10, 1990, &quot;Magellan&quot; encountered Venus and began the orbital insertion maneuver which placed the spacecraft into a three-hour, nine minute, elliptical orbit that brought the spacecraft 295-kilometers from the surface at about 10 degrees North during the periapsis and out to 7762-kilometers during apoapsis.

During each orbit, the space probe captured radar data while the spacecraft was closest to the surface, and then transmitted it back to Earth as it moved away from Venus. This maneuver required extensive use of the reaction wheels to rotate the spacecraft as it imaged the surface for 37-minutes and as it pointed toward Earth for two hours. The primary mission intended for the spacecraft to return images of at least 70 percent of the surface during one Venusian day, which lasts 243 Earth days as the planet slowly spins. To avoid overly-redundant data at the highest and lowest latitudes, the &quot;Magellan&quot; probe alternated between a &quot;Northern-swath&quot;, a region designated as 90 degrees north latitude to 54 degrees south latitude, and a &quot;Southern-swath&quot;, designated as 76 degrees north latitude to 68 degrees south latitude. However, due to periapsis being 10 degrees north of the equatorial line, imaging the South Pole region was unlikely.

====Mapping cycle 1====
*&quot;Goal: Complete primary objective.&quot;
*&quot;September 15, 1990 – May 15, 1991&quot;

The primary mission began on September 15, 1990, with the intention to provide a &quot;left-looking&quot; map of 70% of the Venusian surface at a minimum resolution of 1-kilometer/pixel. During cycle 1, the altitude of the spacecraft varied from 2000-kilometers at the north pole, to 290-kilometers near periapsis. Upon completion during May 15, 1991, having made 1,792 orbits, &quot;Magellan&quot; had mapped approximately 83.7% of the surface with a resolution between 101 and 250-meters/pixel.

===Mission extension===

====Mapping cycle 2====
*&quot;Goal: Image the south pole region and gaps from Cycle 1.&quot;
*&quot;May 15, 1991 – January 14, 1992&quot;

Beginning immediately after the end of cycle 1, cycle 2 was intended to provide data for the existing gaps in the map collected during first cycle, including a large portion of the southern hemisphere. To do this, &quot;Magellan&quot; had to be reoriented, changing the gathering method to &quot;right-looking&quot;. Upon completion during mid-January 1992, cycle 2 provided data for 54.5% of the surface, and combined with the previous cycle, a map containing 96% of the surface could be constructed.

====Mapping cycle 3====
*&quot;Goal: Fill remaining gaps and collect stereo imagery.&quot;
*&quot;January 15, 1992 – September 13, 1992&quot;

Immediately after cycle 2, cycle 3 began collecting data for stereo imagery on the surface that would later allow the ground team to construct, clear, three-dimensional renderings of the surface. Approximately 21.3% of the surface was imaged in stereo by the end of the cycle on September 13, 1992, increasing the overall coverage of the surface to 98%.

====Mapping cycle 4====
*&quot;Goal: Measure Venus&#x27; gravitational field.&quot;
*&quot;September 14, 1992 – May 23, 1993&quot;

Upon completing cycle 3, &quot;Magellan&quot; ceased imaging the surface. Instead, beginning mid-September 1992, the &quot;Magellan&quot; maintained pointing of the high-gain antenna toward Earth where the Deep Space Network began recording a constant stream of telemetry. This constant signal allowed the DSN to collect information on the gravitational field of Venus by monitoring the velocity of the spacecraft. Areas of higher gravitation would slightly increase the velocity of the spacecraft, registering as a Doppler shift in the signal. The space craft completed 1,878 orbits until completion of the cycle on May 23, 1993; a loss of data at the beginning of the cycle necessitated an additional 10 days of gravitational study.

====Mapping cycle 5====
*&quot;Goal: Aerobraking to circular orbit and global gravity measurements.&quot;
*&quot;May 24, 1993 – August 29, 1994&quot;

At the end of the fourth cycle in May 1993, the orbit of &quot;Magellan&quot; was circularized using a technique known as aerobraking. The circularized orbit allowed a much higher resolution of gravimetric data to be acquired when cycle 5 began on August 3, 1993. The spacecraft performed 2,855 orbits and provided high-resolution gravimetric data for 94% of the planet, before the end of the cycle on August 29, 1994.

=====Aerobraking=====
*&quot;Goal: To enter a circular orbit&quot;
*&quot;May 24, 1993 – August 2, 1993&quot;

Aerobraking had long been sought as a method for slowing the orbit of interplanetary spacecraft. Previous suggestions included the need for aeroshells that proved too complicated and expensive for most missions. Testing a new approach to the method, a plan was devised to drop the orbit of &quot;Magellan&quot; into the outermost region of the Venusian atmosphere. Slight friction on the spacecraft slowed the velocity over a period, slightly longer than two months, bringing the spacecraft into an approximately circular orbit with periapse altitude at 180 km and apoapse altitude at 540 km, down from an apoapse altitude at 8467 km. The method has since been used extensively on later interplanetary missions.

====Mapping cycle 6====
*&quot;Goal: Collect high-resolution gravity data and conduct radio science experiments.&quot;
*&quot;April 16, 1994 – October 13, 1994&quot;

The sixth and final orbiting cycle was another extension to the two previous gravimetric studies. Toward the end of the cycle, a final experiment was conducted, known as the &quot;Windmill&quot; experiment to provide data on the composition of the upper atmosphere of Venus. &quot;Magellan&quot; performed 1,783 orbits before the end of the cycle on October 13, 1994, when the spacecraft entered the atmosphere and disintegrated.

=====Windmill experiment=====
*&quot;Goal: Collect data on atmospheric dynamics.&quot;
*&quot;September 6, 1994 – September 14, 1994&quot;

In September 1994, the orbit of &quot;Magellan&quot; was lowered to begin the &quot;Windmill experiment&quot;. During the experiment, the spacecraft was oriented with the solar arrays broadly perpendicular to the orbital path, where they could act as paddles as they impacted molecules of the upper-Venusian atmosphere. Countering this force, the thrusters fired to keep the spacecraft from spinning. This provided data on the basic oxygen gas-surface interaction. This was useful for understanding the impact of upper-atmospheric forces which aided in designing future Earth-orbiting satellites, and methods for aerobraking during future planetary spacecraft missions.

===Results===


*Study of the &quot;Magellan&quot; high-resolution global images is providing evidence to better understand Venusian geology and the role of impacts, volcanism, and tectonics in the formation of Venusian surface structures.
*The surface of Venus is mostly covered by volcanic materials. Volcanic surface features, such as vast lava plains, fields of small lava domes, and large shield volcanoes are common.
*There are few impact craters on Venus, suggesting that the surface is, in general, geologically young – less than 800 million years old.
*The presence of lava channels over 6,000 kilometers long suggests river-like flows of extremely low-viscosity lava that probably erupted at a high rate.
*Large pancake-shaped volcanic domes suggest the presence of a type of lava produced by extensive evolution of crustal rocks.
*The typical signs of terrestrial plate tectonics - continental drift and basin floor spreading - are not evident on Venus. The planet&#x27;s tectonics is dominated by a system of global rift zones and numerous broad, low domical structures called coronae, produced by the upwelling and subsidence of magma from the mantle.
*Although Venus has a dense atmosphere, the surface reveals no evidence of substantial wind erosion, and only evidence of limited wind transport of dust and sand. This contrasts with Mars, where there is a thin atmosphere, but substantial evidence of wind erosion and transport of dust and sand.

&quot;Magellan&quot; created the first (and currently the best) near-photographic quality, high resolution radar mapping of the planet&#x27;s surface features. Prior Venus missions had created low resolution radar globes of general, continent-sized formations. &quot;Magellan&quot;, however, finally allowed detailed imaging and analysis of craters, hills, ridges, and other geologic formations, to a degree comparable to the visible-light photographic mapping of other planets. &quot;Magellan&quot;&#x27;s global radar map currently remains as the most detailed Venus map in existence, although the upcoming NASA VERITAS and Roskosmos Venera-D probes will carry a radar that can achieve a much higher resolution compared to the radar used by &quot;Magellan&quot;. Both probes are expected to launch in 2029.

==Scientists==
The Magellan project was set up so that the initial images and data from the Magellan probe were only for use and study by a team of principal investigators from a variety of universities and institutions, and by the Magellan Project Science Team. These scientists were responsible for validating the data, contributing input for spacecraft acquisition of data, and interpreting the data results for their release to the public. Data was shared with three visiting Soviet scientists (Alexander Basilevsky, Effaim Akim and Alexander Zacharov), a first, and sensitive issue, for NASA at the time considering the Cold War was just coming to a close.

The Magellan Project Science room became notorious for its hanging of long thermal print strips of image data (FBIDRs) along the walls of a spacious room. This was the first form in which the imagery of the surface of Venus was seen due to the long, narrow swathes acquired by the spacecraft. Significant guests during the mission&#x27;s operation included Margaret Thatcher.

After the initial investigation stage Magellan&#x27;s full data set was released for public consumption.

===Project Science Team===
The Magellan Project Science Team consisted of Dr. R. Stephen Saunders, the Project Scientist; Dr. Ellen Stofan, the Deputy Project Scientist; research assistants Tim Parker, Dr. Jeff Plaut, and Annette deCharon; and Project Science Aide, Gregory Michaels.

Other Magellan scientists were involved with the mission&#x27;s science including principal investigators and three visiting Soviet scientists.

==End of mission==

On September 9, 1994, a press release outlined the termination of the &quot;Magellan&quot; mission. Due to the degradation of the power output from the solar arrays and onboard components, and having completed all objectives successfully, the mission was to end in mid-October. The termination sequence began in late August 1994, with a series of orbital trim maneuvers which lowered the spacecraft into the outermost layers of the Venusian atmosphere to allow the Windmill experiment to begin on September 6, 1994. The experiment lasted for two weeks and was followed by subsequent orbital trim maneuvers, further lowering the altitude of the spacecraft for the final termination phase.

On October 11, 1994, moving at a velocity of 7 kilometers/second, the final orbital trim maneuver was performed, placing the spacecraft 139.7 kilometers above the surface, well within the atmosphere. At this altitude the spacecraft encountered sufficient ram pressure to raise temperatures on the solar arrays to .

On October 13, 1994 at 10:05:00 UTC, communication was lost when the spacecraft entered radio occultation behind Venus. The team continued to listen for another signal from the spacecraft until 18:00:00 UTC, when the mission was determined to have concluded. Although much of &quot;Magellan&quot; was expected to vaporize due to atmospheric stresses, some amount of wreckage is thought have hit the surface by 20:00:00 UTC.

Communication with the &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft was lost early Wednesday morning, following an aggressive series of five Orbit Trim Maneuvers (OTMs) on Tuesday, October 11, which took the orbit down into the upper atmosphere of Venus. The Termination experiment (extension of September &quot;Windmill&quot; experiment) design was expected to result in final loss of the spacecraft due to a negative power margin. This was not a problem since spacecraft power would have been too low to sustain operations in the next few weeks due to continuing solar cell loss.

Thus, a final controlled experiment was designed to maximize mission return. This final, low altitude was necessary to study the effects of a carbon dioxide atmosphere.

The final OTM took the periapsis to where the sensible drag on the spacecraft was very evident. The solar panel temperatures rose to 126 deg. C. and the attitude control system fired all available Y-axis thrusters to counteract the torques. However, attitude control was maintained to the end.

The main bus voltage dropped to 24.7 volts after five orbits, and it was predicted that attitude control would be lost if the power dropped below 24 volts. It was decided to enhance the Windmill experiment by changing the panel angles for the remaining orbits. This was also a preplanned experiment option.

At this point, the spacecraft was expected to survive only two orbits.

&quot;Magellan&quot; continued to maintain communication for three more orbits, even though the power continued to drop below 23 volts and eventually reached 20.4 volts. At this time, one battery went off-line, and the spacecraft was defined as power starved.

Communication was lost at 3:02 am PDT just as &quot;Magellan&quot; was about to enter an Earth occultation on orbit 15032. Contact was not re-established. Tracking operations were continued to 11:00 am but no signal was seen, and none was expected. The spacecraft should land on Venus by 1:00 pm PDT Thursday, October 13, 1994.

<text>The 1st Infantry Division (1ID) is a combined arms division of the United States Army, and is the oldest continuously serving division in the Regular Army. It has seen continuous service since its organization in 1917 during World War I. It was officially nicknamed &quot;The Big Red One&quot; (abbreviated &quot;BRO&quot;) after its shoulder patch and is also nicknamed &quot;The Fighting First&quot;. The division has also received troop monikers of &quot;The Big Dead One&quot; and &quot;The Bloody First&quot; as puns on the respective officially sanctioned nicknames. It is currently based at Fort Riley, Kansas.

==World War I==
A few weeks after the American entry into World War I, the First Expeditionary Division, later designated as the 1st Infantry Division, was constituted on 24 May 1917, in the Regular Army, and was organized on 8 June 1917, at Fort Jay, on Governors Island in New York harbor under the command of Brigadier General William L. Sibert, from Army units then in service on the Mexico–United States border and at various Army posts throughout the United States. The original table of organization and equipment (TO&amp;E) included two organic infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each, one engineer battalion; one signal battalion; one trench mortar battery; one field artillery brigade of three field artillery regiments; one air squadron; and a full division train. The total authorized strength of this TO&amp;E was 18,919 officers and enlisted men. George S. Patton, who served as the first headquarters commandant for the American Expeditionary Forces, oversaw much of the arrangements for the movement of the 1st Division to France, and their organization in-country. Frank W. Coe, who later served as Chief of Coast Artillery, was the division&#x27;s first chief of staff.

The first units sailed from New York City and Hoboken, New Jersey, on 14 June 1917. Throughout the remainder of the year, the rest of the division had followed, landing at St. Nazaire, France, and Liverpool, England. After a brief stay in rest camps, the troops in England proceeded to France, landing at Le Havre. The last unit arrived in St. Nazaire 22 December. Upon arrival in France, the division, less its artillery, was assembled in the First (Gondrecourt) training area, and the artillery was at Le Valdahon.

On 4 July, the 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry, paraded through the streets of Paris to bolster the sagging French spirits. An apocryphal story holds that at Lafayette&#x27;s tomb, to the delight of the attending Parisians, Captain Charles E. Stanton of the division&#x27;s 16th Infantry Regiment stepped forward and declared, &quot;Lafayette, nous sommes ici! [Lafayette, we are here!]&quot; Two days later, on 6 July, Headquarters, First Expeditionary Division was redesignated as Headquarters, First Division, American Expeditionary Forces.

On 8 August 1917, the 1st Division adopted the &quot;square&quot; Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&amp;E), which specified two organic infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each; one engineer regiment; one signal battalion; one machine gun battalion; one field artillery brigade of three field artillery regiments, and a complete division train. The total authorized strength of this new TO&amp;E was 27,120 officers and enlisted men.

On the morning of 23 October, the first American shell of the war was fired towards German lines by a First Division artillery unit. Two days later, the 2nd Battalion of the 16th Infantry had suffered the first American casualties of the war.

By April 1918, the German Army had pushed to within of Paris. In reaction to this thrust, the division moved into the Picardy Sector to bolster the exhausted French First Army. To the division&#x27;s front lay the small village of Cantigny, situated on the high ground overlooking a forested countryside. The 28th Infantry Regiment attacked the town, and within 45 minutes captured it along with 250 German soldiers. It was the first American victory of the war. The 28th was thereafter named the &quot;Black Lions of Cantigny.&quot;


Soissons was taken by the 1st Division in July 1918. The Soisson&#x27;s victory was costly – 700 men were killed or wounded. (One of them, Private Francis Lupo of Cincinnati, was missing in action for 85 years, until his remains were discovered on the former battlefield in 2003. The Remains of Pfc Charles McAllister, recovered with Francis Lupo were not identified and reburied until August 21, 2024). The 1st Division took part in the first offensive by an American army in the war, and helped to clear the Saint-Mihiel salient by fighting continuously from 11 to 13 September 1918. The last major World War I battle was fought in the Meuse-Argonne Forest. The division advanced a total of seven kilometers and defeated, in whole or part, eight German divisions. This victory was mainly due to the efforts of Colonel George C. Marshall, who began the war as the division&#x27;s deputy chief of staff before being elevated to G-3 for the entire AEF in July 1918. Combat operations ended with the implementation of the terms of the Armistice on 11 November 1918. At the time the division was at Sedan, the farthest American penetration of the war, and was the first to cross the Rhine into occupied Germany.

By the end of the war, the division had reported it had suffered 4,964 killed in action, 17,201 wounded in action, and 1,056 missing or died of wounds. Five division soldiers received Medals of Honor.

The division&#x27;s dog mascot was a mixed-breed terrier known as Rags. Rags was adopted by the division in 1918 and remained its mascot until his death in 1936. Rags achieved notoriety and celebrity as a war dog, after saving many lives in the crucial Argonne Campaign by delivering a vital message despite being bombed and gassed.

==Interwar period==

The 1st Division proceeded to Camp Meade, Maryland, where all emergency period personnel were discharged from the service. It then went to Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky, and took up temporary station there from 20 October 1919 to 8 October 1920. It dispatched elements of several regiments to quell striking coal miners in West Virginia in November 1919 and again to Lexington, Kentucky, in February 1920. It transferred in a permanent change of station to Camp Dix, New Jersey, where it arrived on 10 October 1920.

On 7 October 1920, the 1st Division organized under the new peacetime table of organization and equipment which included two organic infantry brigades of two infantry regiments each, a field artillery brigade of two (later three) field artillery regiments and an ammunition train, an engineer regiment; a medical regiment, a division quartermaster train, a special troops command, and an observation squadron. The total authorized strength of this TO&amp;E was 19,385. The 1st Division was one of three Regular Army infantry divisions and one cavalry division that was authorized to nominally remain at &quot;peacetime&quot; strength. In 1921, the 1st Division was allotted to the Second Corps Area, and assigned to the II Corps. In August 1921, elements of the division were once again dispatched to West Virginia to control striking coal miners. In spring 1922, the division’s units were ordered to posts throughout the northeastern United States, with most units arriving at their new duty stations in June and July 1922. 

The division headquarters was posted to Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, New York, arriving there on 6 June 1922. The 1st Infantry Brigade and the division special troops were concentrated at posts in the New York City area, while the 2nd Infantry Brigade was scattered over posts in upstate New York. The 1st Field Artillery Brigade&#x27;s units were spread from Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, to Fort Hoyle, Maryland. By the mid-1920s, however, the division headquarters had nearly ceased to exist, with only the division commander and a few staff officers remaining to carry out essential functions; they did not exercise a true command function over their units. By 1926, the War Department and the Second Corps Area realized the unsustainability of the situation and repopulated the 1st Division headquarters. The training of the division’s maneuver units took place, for the most part, in the late summer and early fall after they assisted the training of Organized Reserve units, the Citizens Military Training Camps, and summer camps for ROTC cadets. The 1st Infantry Brigade conducted training each fall at Camp Dix, New Jersey, where the brigade also trained its affiliate Reserve units during the summer. The 2nd Infantry Brigade usually conducted the training of its Reserve units at the brigade’s home posts, and afterwards, concentrated for training at Pine Camp, New York, in the fall. The first opportunity after 1922 to gather the division in one place came in 1927 when most of the division assembled at Camp Dix for various training events from August–November. To prepare the staff for the maneuver, the division held a CCX (command and communications exercise) at Camp Dix earlier that spring. The exercise was apparently very successful as similar CCXs were held periodically thereafter. The next major training event for the division came in August 1935 when the First and Second Corps Area elements of the First Army were assembled at Pine Camp for small unit maneuvers. This maneuver was followed in turn by the First Army command post exercise held at Fort Devens in August 1937. Shortly afterward, in September 1937, the division, minus the 2nd Infantry Brigade and some field artillery units, was concentrated at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania, for maneuvers. Concurrently, the 2nd Infantry Brigade, reinforced by the artillery units from Fort Ethan Allen and Madison Barracks, New York, assembled at Pine Camp for maneuvers.

These maneuvers were followed by the first of several amphibious operations performed by the division’s units prior to World War II. The first landing exercises were held by division elements in Puerto Rico and Culebra Island in January and February 1938. The amphibious training was followed by the next First Army maneuver, held in the Plattsburg, New York, area in August 1939. In October 1939, the 1st Division adopted a new &quot;triangular&quot; peacetime TO&amp;E which included three infantry regiments, one military police company, one engineer battalion, one signal company, one light field artillery regiment of three field artillery battalions and one medium field artillery regiment of two field artillery battalions, one medical battalion, and one quartermaster battalion. The authorized strength of this TO&amp;E was 9,057 officers and enlisted men. In November 1939, the division deployed to Fort Benning, Georgia, where it was assigned temporarily to the IV Corps to train and test the new triangular organization. These exercises were held in preparation for the maneuvers in Louisiana in May 1940 when the IV Corps was pitted against the provisional IX Corps.

After the exercises in Louisiana, the division returned to New York to participate in the 1940 First Army Maneuver near Canton, New York, in August–September. For this maneuver, the 1st Division was again part of the II Corps. The 1st Division reorganized again on 1 November 1940 to a new TO&amp;E, which added a reconnaissance troop, and put the two field artillery regiments under a division artillery command, raising its strength to a total of 15,245 officers and enlisted men. The two regiments were later reorganized into four battalions. In February 1941, the “Fighting First” was transferred to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, to concentrate for additional training. Concurrently, the division was relieved from the II Corps and assigned to the VI Corps. The following August, the division moved to the New River area of North Carolina for additional amphibious training. After the training at New River, the 1st Division participated in the Carolina Maneuvers held in November 1941 near Charlotte, North Carolina.

===Combat chronicle===
Shortly after the German invasion of Poland, beginning World War II in Europe, the 1st Infantry Division, under Major General Walter Short, was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, on 19 November 1939 where it supported the U.S. Army Infantry School as part of American mobilization preparations. It then moved to the Sabine Parish, Louisiana area on 11 May 1940 to participate in the Louisiana Maneuvers. The division next relocated to Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn on 5 June 1940, where it spent over six months before moving to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, on 4 February 1941. As part of its training that year, the division participated in both Carolina Maneuvers of October and November before returning to Fort Devens, Massachusetts on 6 December 1941.

A day later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and, four days later, Germany declared war on the United States, thus bringing the United States into the conflict. The division was ordered to Camp Blanding, Florida, as quickly as trains could be gathered and winter weather permitted, and arrived on 21 February 1942. The division, now under Major General Donald C. Cubbison, was there reorganized and refurbished with new equipment, being re-designated as the 1st Infantry Division on 15 May 1942. Within a week, the division was returned to its former post at Fort Benning, Georgia, from where it was expedited on 21 June 1942 to Indiantown Gap Military Reservation for wartime overseas deployment final preparation. The division, now under the command of Major General Terry Allen, a distinguished World War I veteran, departed the New York Port of Embarkation on 1 August 1942, arrived in Beaminster in south-west England about a week later, and departed 22 October 1942 for the combat amphibious assault of North Africa.

As part of II Corps, the division landed in Oran, Algeria on 8 November 1942 as part of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. Elements of the division then took part in combat at Maktar, Tebourba, Medjez el Bab, the Battle of Kasserine Pass (where American forces were pushed back), and Gafsa. It then led the Allied assault in brutal fighting at El Guettar, Béja, and Mateur. The 1st Infantry Division was in combat in the Tunisian Campaign from 21 January 1943 to 9 May 1943, helping secure Tunisia. The campaign ended just days later, with the surrender of almost 250,000 Axis soldiers. After months of nearly continuous fighting, the division had a short rest before training for the next operation.

In July 1943, the division took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, still under the command of Major General Allen. Lieutenant General George S. Patton, commanding the U.S. Seventh Army, specifically requested the division as part of his forces for the invasion of Sicily. It was still assigned to the II Corps. In Sicily, the 1st Division saw heavy action when making amphibious landings opposed by Italian and German tanks at the Battle of Gela. The 1st Division then moved up through the center of Sicily, slogging it out through the mountains along with the 45th Infantry Division. In these mountains, the division saw some of the heaviest fighting in the entire Sicilian campaign at the Battle of Troina; some units lost more than half their strength in assaulting the mountain town. On 7 August 1943, Major General Allen was relieved of his command by Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, then commanding the II Corps. Allen was replaced by Major General Clarence R. Huebner who was, like Allen, a decorated veteran of World War I who had served with the 1st Infantry Division throughout the war.

When that campaign was over, the division returned to England, arriving there on 5 November 1943 to prepare for the eventual invasion of Normandy. One regimental combat team of 1st Infantry Division and one regimental combat team from the 29th Infantry Division as well as A,B,C companies of the 2nd Rangers Battalion and the 5th Rangers Battalion comprised the first wave of troops that assaulted German Army defenses on Omaha Beach on D-Day. The division had to run 300 yards to get to the bluffs, with some of the division&#x27;s units suffering 30 percent casualties in the first hour of the assault, and secured Formigny and Caumont in the beachhead by the end of the day. The division followed up the Saint-Lô break-through with an attack on Marigny, 27 July 1944.

The division then drove across France in a continuous offensive. It took large numbers of prisoners during the Battle of the Mons Pocket, and reached the German border at Aachen in September. The division laid siege to Aachen, taking the city after a direct assault on 21 October 1944. The 1st Division then attacked east of Aachen through the Hürtgen Forest, driving to the Ruhr, and was moved to a rear area 7 December 1944 for refitting and rest following 6 months of combat. When the German &quot;Wacht Am Rhein&quot; offensive (commonly called the Battle of the Bulge) was launched on 16 December 1944, the division, now commanded by Major General Clift Andrus, was quickly moved to the Ardennes front. Fighting continuously from 17 December 1944 to 28 January 1945, the division helped to blunt and reverse the German offensive. Thereupon, the division, now commanded by Major General Clift Andrus, attacked and again breached the Siegfried Line, fought across the Ruhr, 23 February 1945, and drove on to the Rhine, crossing at the Remagen bridgehead, 15–16 March. The division broke out of the bridgehead, took part in the encirclement of the Ruhr Pocket, captured Paderborn, pushed through the Harz Mountains, and was in Czechoslovakia, fighting at Kynšperk nad Ohří, Prameny, and Mnichov (Domažlice District) when the war in Europe ended. Seventeen members of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor during World War II.

==Cold War==

===Korean War===
During the Korean War, the Big Red One was assigned to occupation duty in Germany, while acting as a strategic deterrent against Soviet designs on Europe. 1st Infantry Division troops secured the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials and later transported seven convicted Nazi war criminals to Spandau Prison in Berlin.

In 1955, the division colors left Germany and were relocated to Fort Riley, Kansas.

===1950s–1970s===
Following its return from Germany, the 1st Infantry Division established headquarters at Fort Riley, Kansas. Its troops reorganized and trained for war at Fort Riley and at other posts.
In 1962 and 1963, four 1st Infantry Division Pentomic battle groups (2nd Battle Group, 12th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 13th Infantry; 1st Battle Group, 28th Infantry; and 2d Battle Group, 26th Infantry) rotated, in turn, to West Berlin, Germany to augment the U.S. Army&#x27;s Berlin Brigade during an international crisis initiated by the construction of the Berlin Wall. These &quot;Long Thrust Operations&quot; were the most significant deployments conducted by 1st Infantry Division troops during the Cold War, placing Big Red One troops in confrontation with hostile communist forces.
From President Kennedy&#x27;s approval on 25 May 1961, the Army divisions began to convert to the &quot;Reorganization Objective Army Division 1965&quot; (ROAD) structure in early 1962. While the bulk of the division was moved to Fort Riley in April 1970 (the colors returning to Kansas from Vietnam) replacing the inactivated 24th Infantry Division, its 3d Brigade, the Division Forward replacement component of REFORGER for the inactivated 24th Infantry Division, a mixture of cavalry and infantry, was forward-deployed to Germany. The brigade was initially stationed at Sheridan Kaserne, Augsburg, later moving to Cooke Barracks in Göppingen, with four battalions (two infantry, two armor) and the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry stationed in Stuttgart/Boeblingen (Panzer Kaserne) and the field artillery battalion in Neu Ulm (Wiley Kaserne) with the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry in Göppingen and the 3d Battalion, 63d Armor in Augsburg. The Division Forward was inactivated on 15 August 1991 and the Big Red One became a two-brigade division with an assigned National Guard &quot;roundout&quot; brigade.

===Vietnam War===

The division fought in the Vietnam War from 1965 to 1970.
Arriving in July 1965, the division began combat operations within two weeks. By the end of 1965, the division had participated in three major operations: Hump, Bushmaster 1 and Bushmaster II, under the command of MG Jonathan O. Seaman.

In 1966, the division took part in Operation Marauder, Operation Crimp II and Operation Rolling Stone, all in the early part of the year. In March, Major General William E. DePuy took command. In June and July the division took part in the battles of Ap Tau O, Srok Dong and Minh Thanh Road. In November 1966, the division participated in Operation Attleboro.

1967 saw the division in Operation Cedar Falls, Operation Junction City, Operation Manhattan, Operation Billings, and Operation Shenandoah II. MG John H. Hay assumed command in February. On 17 June 1967, during Operation Billings, the division suffered 185 casualties, 35 killed and 150 wounded in the battle of Xom Bo II. Three months later on 17 October 1967, the division suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Ong Thanh with 58 killed.

The division was involved in the Tet Offensive of 1968, securing the massive Tan Son Nhut Air Base. In March, MG Keith L. Ware took command. That same month the division took part in Operation Quyet Thang (&quot;Resolve to Win&quot;) and in April the division participated in the largest operation of the Vietnam War, Operation Toan Thang (&quot;Certain Victory&quot;). On 13 September Ware was killed in action when his command helicopter was shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire during the Battle of Lộc Ninh. MG Orwin C. Talbott moved up from his position of assistant division commander to assume command of the division.

In the first half of 1969, the division conducted reconnaissance-in-force and ambush operations, including a multi-divisional Operation Atlas Wedge. The last part of the year saw the division take part in &quot;Dong Tien&quot; (&quot;Progress Together&quot;) operations. These operations were intended to assist South Vietnamese forces to take a more active role in combat. In August, MG Albert E. Milloy took command of the division while the division took part in battles along National Highway 13, known as &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to the end of the year.

In January 1970 it was announced that the division would return to Fort Riley. The division officially departed South Vietnam on 7 April 1970, when the division commander Brigadier General John Q. Henion, left Bien Hoa Air Base and returned the colors to Fort Riley. 11 members of the division were awarded the Medal of Honor. During its involvement in the Vietnam War, the division lost 6,146 killed in action, with a further 16,019 wounded. Twenty of its number were taken as prisoners of war.

==Post-Cold War era==

===First Gulf War===
The division, commanded by Major General Thomas G. Rhame, also participated in Operation Desert Storm. The division&#x27;s two maneuver brigades from Fort Riley were rounded out by the addition of two tank battalions (2nd and 3rd, 66th Armor), an infantry battalion (1-41st Infantry), and a field artillery battalion (4-3 FA) from 2nd Armored Division (Forward) in Germany. The division played a significant role in the Battle of Norfolk. Specific combat arms and combat support units of the 3rd Battalion, 37th Armor and others were responsible for the initial breach of the Iraqi defenses providing subsequent passages for the rest of VII Corps, consequently rolling over the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division and taking 2,600 prisoners of war. The division continued with the subsequent long assault on Iraqi-held territory over 100 hours, engaging eleven Iraqi divisions, destroying 550 tanks, 480 armored personnel carriers and taking 11,400 prisoners. 1st Infantry Division Artillery, including 4-3 FA battalion, was decisive during combat operations performing multiple raids and fire missions. These combat operations resulted in the destruction of 50 enemy tanks, 139 APCs, 30 air defense systems, 152 artillery pieces, 27 missile launchers, 108 mortars, 548 wheeled vehicles, 61 trench lines and bunker positions, 92 dug-in and open infantry targets, and 34 logistical sites. By the early morning of 28 February 1991, the division had taken position along the &quot;Highway of Death&quot;, preventing any Iraqi retreat. The division&#x27;s HHC, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta 3/37 Armor, HHC, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta 4/37 Armor, and 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment (1/4 CAV), was then tasked with securing the town of Safwan, Iraq, and the airfield there where the Iraqis were later forced to sign the surrender agreement.

Valorous Unit citation:

There was also the &quot;bulldozer assault&quot;, wherein the 1st and 2nd Brigades from the 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) used mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to bury Iraqi soldiers defending the fortified &quot;Saddam Line.&quot; While approximately 2,000 men surrendered, escaping death, one newspaper story reported that U.S. commanders estimated thousands of Iraqi soldiers had been buried alive during the two-day assault over the period 24–25 February 1991.

In 1996 the division colors were relocated to the German city of Würzburg (replacing the 3rd Infantry Division, which had relocated to Fort Stewart, GA). The division would remain in Germany until 2006, when the colors were struck and moved (again) to Fort Riley, Kansas.

This unique C2 relationship earned the brigade the moniker of the &quot;Luckiest Brigade in the Army&quot; from the USD-C commander. The brigade was placed under USD-C (initially 1st AD, then 25th Infantry Division after Dec 2011) and was single-handedly responsible for the entire province of Baghdad. As the brigade responsible for the &quot;center of gravity&quot; (i.e. Baghdad) for United States Forces-Iraq, the 2nd &quot;Dagger&quot; Brigade was responsible for advising and assisting 50% of the Iraqi security forces within Iraq including two Iraqi corps HQ (the Karkh Area Command and Rusafa Area Command) and seven Iraqi divisions (6th IA, 9th IA – Mechanized, 17th IA, 11th IA, 1st FP, 2nd FP, and 4th FP) and 50,000 Iraqi policemen.

The 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment, commanded by LTC John Cross, was located at Camp Taji and FOB Old MOD. They were partnered with the 9th and 11th IA Divisions. 1st Battalion, 7th FA, commanded by LTC Andrew Gainey, was located at JSS Loyalty. They were partnered with the 1st Federal Police Division. 1st Battalion, 63rd Armored, commanded by LTC Michael Henderson, was located at JSS Deason, Muthana Airfield, and VBC. They were partnered with the 6th and 17th IA Divisions. 5th Squadron, 4th Cavalry, commanded by LTC Mathew Moore was located at JSS Falcon. They were partnered with the 2nd and 4th FP Divisions. The Special Troops Battalion, commanded by LTC Shilisa Geter, was located at VBC (Victory Base Complex) and partnered with the Baghdad Police Directorate. Meanwhile, due to the drawdown of US forces and the redeployment of theater-level sustainment brigades, the 299th BSB, commanded by LTC Dale Farrand, assumed the area support mission for all DOD and DOS elements within the province of Baghdad in addition to supporting the Dagger Brigade.

Significant events during this deployment included the resumption of attacks by the Sadrist movement and other Iranian-backed militia, the subsequent operations that stopped those attacks, the rearward passage of lines of USD-North as they redeployed through Baghdad, the organization and training of divisional field artillery regiments for the IA divisions, the fielding of M1 tanks for the 9th IA Division, and the hand-over of all US facilities within Baghdad to the Government of Iraq or elements of the US State Department. During this deployment the brigade simultaneously trained ISF units to the point of conducting Iraqi-led battalion CALFEXs, advised ISF units as they conducted hundreds of Iraqi-led raids which disrupted the attacks of Iranian-backed militia, while also conducting unilateral and combined force protection operations to ensure the security of US bases and redeploying US forces. The brigade experienced nine KIAs during this deployment, the majority of which resulted from a single IRAM attack (improvised rocket-assisted munition) conducted against JSS Loyalty by Iranian-backed militia on 6 June 2011. The brigade departed Iraq in November 2011 after having turned the majority of the city of Baghdad over to complete Iraqi control.

===Afghanistan 2011–2012===
From 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry (CAB) and 4th Squadron, 4th Cavalry deployed to Afghanistan in the winter of 2011, with 2nd Battalion, 34th Armor (CAB) later deploying in the spring of 2011. 1–16 IN (CAB) was assigned to support the combined joint special task force, the Iron Rangers were deployed to 58 remote locations across Afghanistan. They completed more than 10,000 missions as part of village stability operations with the Afghan people. The operations connected the government of Afghanistan to the village level and taught Afghans about their constitution. 2–34 AR (CAB) was deployed to Maiwand, Kandahar Province located southern Afghanistan near the Kandahar/Helmand Province border. 4-4 Cavalry was deployed to central Zhari District, Kandahar province and conducted thousands of combat patrols throughout the birthplace and homeland of the Taliban.

3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed to Khost and Paktya provinces in Eastern Afghanistan in January 2011. 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment was once again detached from the brigade and deployed to Ghazni province under Polish command. The brigade conducted Operations Tofan I and II. Tofan I&#x27;s mission was to disrupt insurgent safe havens in the Musa Khel region of Khowst Province, improve the ability for the government to reach the people there and gather intelligence for planning future operations. Tofan II&#x27;s mission was to establish contact with the insurgents, disrupt their logistics, and reduce any material or moral support from the local population. The movement to the extremely remote area, which featured narrow or non-existent roads set among mountains, included mounted and dismounted soldiers who also had to be aware of the need to control the key terrain features around Suri Kheyl.

===Afghanistan 2012–2013===
The 1st Infantry Division headquarters deployed to Bagram, Afghanistan on 19 April 2012 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom XIII after receiving responsibility for Regional Command (East)(RC(E)) from 1st Cavalry Division. The division served as the Combined Joint Task Force-1 (CJTF-1) and RC(E), command and controlling the vital region (Bamiyan, Parwan, Panjshayr, Kapisa, Laghman, Nuristan, Konar, Nangarhar, Maiden Wardak, Logar, Paktiya, Khowst, Ghazni, and Paktika) surrounding Kabul and a large portion of the volatile border with Pakistan. During the division&#x27;s tenure in Afghanistan, the division oversaw a transition of authority to the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF)201st Corps north of Kabul and had prepared the ANSF 203rd Corps to assume full security responsibility south of Kabul prior to transitioning RC(E) to 101st Airborne Division (AASLT).

The 4th IBCT deployed to Afghanistan in May 2012 for a 9-month deployment. The brigade operated in Ghazni and Paktika provinces in eastern Afghanistan. Dragon Brigade concluded its deployment in February 2013, transitioning oversight of Ghazni province to 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain Division and Paktika province to 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division and full security responsibility for those provinces to 3rd and 2nd Brigades, ANSF 203rd Corps, respectively.

===Operation Inherent Resolve===
In response to the growing ISIL threat the Department of Defense announced on 25 September 2014 that approximately 500 soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division Headquarters will be deployed to Iraq with the task of assisting Iraqi Security Forces. This will be the first Division HQ deployed in Iraq since withdrawal back in 2011. Among the soldiers sent over approximately 200 will be stationed in Baghdad, where they will make up close to half of US troops deployed.

In mid-October 2016 the US Army announced it will deploy about 500 soldiers from the 1st Infantry Division Headquarters to Iraq in the fall of 2016. Troops will assume the role of Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command-Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.

===Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel===
In late July 2016, the U.S. Army announced that it will send 800 soldiers from 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, to Afghanistan to support Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel – the U.S. counter-terrorism operation against the remnants of al-Qaeda, ISIS–K and other terror groups. The brigade will deploy with its AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters sometime before October 2016.

===Operation Atlantic Resolve===
In April 2017, &quot;Military.com&quot; reported that approximately 4,000 soldiers from the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division will deploy to Europe as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, replacing the 3rd Armored BCT, 4th Infantry Division in a regular rotation of forces. The unit deployed in September 2017 and redeployed in June 2018, serving throughout Eastern Europe conducting readiness and inter-operability training with NATO Allies to assure U.S. Allies and deter aggression. The Division Headquarters deployed part of its headquarters in March 2018 to Poznan, Poland, to serve as the U.S. Army Europe&#x27;s Mission Command Element forward providing mission command of the Regionally Aligned Forces serving in Atlantic Resolve. They are scheduled to remain until June 2020. In January the division&#x27;s 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team and 1st Combat Aviation Brigade deployed to Eastern Europe in Support of Operation Atlantic Resolve with the mission of building readiness, assuring Allies, and deterring aggression on the continent. The 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team deployed again to Operation Atlantic Resolve in July 2021. The Brigade&#x27;s deployment was extended indefinitely in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

==Insignia==
No credible source states how the insignia of the 1st Infantry Division originated in World War I. There are two theories as to how the idea of the patch came about. The first theory states that the 1st Division supply trucks were manufactured in England. To make sure the 1st Division&#x27;s trucks were not confused with other allies, the drivers would paint a huge &quot;1&quot; on the side of each truck. Later, the division engineers would go even further and put a red number one on their sleeves.

The second theory claims that a general of the division decided the unit should have a shoulder insignia. He decided to cut a red numeral &quot;1&quot; from his flannel underwear. When he showed his prototype to his men, one lieutenant said, &quot;the general&#x27;s underwear is showing!&quot; Offended, the general challenged the young lieutenant to come up with something better. So, the young officer cut a piece of gray cloth from the uniform of a captured soldier and placed the red &quot;1&quot; on top.

==Music==
===Band===
The 1st Infantry Division Band (abbreviated as the 1ID Band and often known as the Big Red One Band) is the musical ambassador for the division that performs for military ceremonies at Fort Riley and the surrounding communities in the Midwest. The 38-member band contains the Concert Wind Ensemble, the Marching Band, a Seated Ceremonial Band as well as other specialized ensembles. The band was notably involved in the Thunder Road incident in Vietnam, during which Major General John Hay ordered the band to march down &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, for one mile while playing the Colonel Bogey March. The road, which was critical to the division&#x27;s operations, was under the control of a North Vietnamese Army regiment. Confused by the action, the regiment withdrew from the area, with the band fulfilling a remarkable combat mission without firing a shot. In 2008, a parachutist injured three members of the band after crashing into them following getting off course during military review.

===Song===
According to the 1st Infantry Division history, the song was composed in 1943 by Captain Donald T. Kellett, who retired after a 30-year career as a colonel and died in 1991. Later revised from &quot;Men of a great division&quot; to &quot;Soldiers of a great division&quot;.

<text>A volcanologist, or volcano scientist, is a geologist who focuses on understanding the formation and eruptive activity of volcanoes. Volcanologists frequently visit volcanoes, sometimes active ones, to observe and monitor volcanic eruptions, collect eruptive products including tephra (such as ash or pumice), rock and lava samples. One major focus of inquiry in recent times is the prediction of eruptions to alleviate the impact on surrounding populations and monitor natural hazards associated with volcanic activity. Geologists who research volcanic materials that make up the solid Earth are referred to as igneous petrologists.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;volcanologist&quot; (or &quot;vulcanologist&quot;) is derived from the English volcanology (volcano + ), which was derived from the French (or vulcanologie), which was further derived from the French word (volcano), which was even further derived from Vulcanus, the Latin name of the Roman god of fire and metalworking. The Latin word is of Etruscan origin, but unknown meaning.

== Job overview ==

=== Job Description ===
Volcanologists research many aspects of volcanic processes to better understand planetary formation or to monitor current and future volcanic eruptions in order to protect citizens living in volcanic hazard zones. Volcanologists work at universities, museums or other national research institutes (often including volcano observatories), or in industry. Volcanologists working in academia will be usually involved in teaching geology classes if based at a university (lecturer or professor), running of laboratory experiments, data collection, and writing of scientific peer-reviewed papers for the scientific community to critique and advance knowledge and discovery. Volcanologists working for volcano observatories and museums work in close collaboration with academic researchers, but day-to-day tasks may also include the collection and curation of volcanic samples, writing of reports from monitoring stations, and public outreach relating to volcanic hazards and climate change

=== Sub-disciplines of volcanology ===
* Igneous petrologist
* Physical volcanogist - someone who typically studies the physical characteristics of volcanic ash deposits and rocks.
* Experimental petrologist - someone who simulates volcanic and magmatic processes in a laboratory (are often specialists in thermodynamics applied to Earth processes).
* Geochemist - those who study the chemical composition of volcanic rocks and gases (see also isotope geochemistry). Geochemists often use mass spectrometry and electron microprobe analysis to understand the pre-eruption history of volcanic rocks and how fast eruptions occur.
* Volcano geophysicist (or volcano seismologist)
* Planetary volcanologist - someone who studies volcanic processes on other planetary bodies.

<text>Chinese poetry is poetry written, spoken, or chanted in the Chinese language, and a part of the Chinese literature. While this last term comprises Classical Chinese, Standard Chinese, Mandarin Chinese, Yue Chinese, and other historical and vernacular forms of the language, its poetry generally falls into one of two primary types, Classical Chinese poetry and Modern Chinese poetry.

Poetry is consistently held in high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati. Poetry provides a format and a forum for both public and private expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Chinese poetry often reflects the influence of China&#x27;s various religious traditions.

Classical Chinese poetry includes, perhaps first and foremost &quot;shi&quot; (詩/诗), and also other major types such as &quot;ci&quot; (詞/词) and &quot;qu&quot; (曲). There is also a traditional Chinese literary form called &quot;fu&quot; (賦/赋), which defies categorization into English more than the other terms, but perhaps can best be described as a kind of prose-poem. During the modern period, there also has developed free verse in Western style. Traditional forms of Chinese poetry are rhymed, but the mere rhyming of text may not qualify literature as being poetry; and, as well, the lack of rhyme would not necessarily disqualify a modern work from being considered poetry, in the sense of modern Chinese poetry.

==Beginnings of the tradition: &quot;Shijing&quot; and &quot;Chuci&quot;==
The earliest extant anthologies are the &quot;Shi Jing&quot; (詩經) and &quot;Chu Ci&quot; (楚辭). Both of these have had a great impact on the subsequent poetic tradition. Earlier examples of ancient Chinese poetry may have been lost because of the vicissitudes of history, such as the burning of books and burying of scholars (焚書坑儒) by Qin Shi Huang, although one of the targets of this last event was the &quot;Shi Jing&quot;, which has nevertheless survived.

===&quot;Shijing&quot;===

The elder of these two works, the &quot;Shijing&quot; (also familiarly known, in English, as the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; and as the &quot;Book of Songs&quot; or transliterated as the &quot;Sheh Ching&quot;) is a preserved collection of Classical Chinese poetry from over two millennia ago. Its content is divided into 3 parts: Feng (風, folk songs from 15 small countries, 160 songs in total), Ya (雅, Imperial court songs, subdivided into daya and xiaoya, 105 songs in total) and Song (頌, singing in ancestral worship, 40 songs in total).This anthology received its final compilation sometime in the 7th century BCE. The collection contains both aristocratic poems regarding life at the royal court (&quot;Odes&quot;) and also more rustic poetry and images of natural settings, derived at least to some extent from folksongs (&quot;Songs&quot;). The &quot;Shijing&quot; poems are predominantly composed of four-character lines (四言), rather than the five and seven character lines typical of later Classical Chinese poetry. The main techniques of expression (rhetorics) are Fu (賦, Direct elaborate narrative), bi (比, metaphor) and Xing (興, describe other thing to foreshadowing the main content).

===&quot;Chuci&quot;===

In contrast to the classic &quot;Shijing&quot;, the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; anthology (also familiarly known, in English, as the &quot;Songs of Chu&quot; or the &quot;Songs of the South&quot; or transliterated as the &quot;Chu Tz&#x27;u&quot;) consists of verses more emphasizing lyric and romantic features, as well as irregular line-lengths and other influences from the poetry typical of the state of Chu. The &quot;Chuci&quot; collection consists primarily of poems ascribed to Qu Yuan (屈原) (329–299 BCE) and his follower Song Yu, although in its present form the anthology dates to Wang I&#x27;s 158 CE compilation and notes, which are the only historically reliable sources of both the text and information regarding its composition. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE−220 CE), the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; style of poetry contributed to the evolution of the &quot;fu&quot; (&quot;descriptive poem&quot;) style, typified by a mixture of verse and prose passages (often used as a virtuoso display the poet&#x27;s skills and knowledge rather than to convey intimate emotional experiences). The &quot;fu&quot; form remained popular during the subsequent Six Dynasties period, although it became shorter and more personal. The &quot;fu&quot; form of poetry remains as one of the generic pillars of Chinese poetry; although, in the Tang dynasty, five-character and seven-character &quot;shi&quot; poetry begins to dominate.

==Han poetry==
Also during the Han dynasty, a folk-song style of poetry became popular, known as &quot;yuefu&quot; (樂府/乐府) &quot;Music Bureau&quot; poems, so named because of the government&#x27;s role in collecting such poems, although in time some poets began composing original works in &quot;yuefu&quot; style. Many &quot;yuefu&quot; poems are composed of five-character (五言) or seven-character (七言) lines, in contrast to the four-character lines of earlier times. A characteristic form of Han dynasty literature is the &quot;fu&quot;. The poetic period of the end of the Han dynasty and the beginning of the Six Dynasties era is known as Jian&#x27;an poetry. An important collection of Han poetry is the &quot;Nineteen Old Poems&quot;.

==Jian&#x27;an poetry==

Between and over-lapping the poetry of the latter days of the Han and the beginning period of the Six Dynasties was Jian&#x27;an poetry. Examples of surviving poetry from this period include the works of the &quot;Three Caos&quot;: Cao Cao, Cao Pi, and Cao Zhi.

==Six Dynasties poetry==
The Six Dynasties era (220–589 CE) was one of various developments in poetry, both continuing and building on the traditions developed and handed down from previous eras and also leading up to further developments of poetry in the future. Major examples of poetry surviving from this dynamic era include the works of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, the poems of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering, the Midnight Songs poetry of the four seasons, the great &quot;fields and garden&quot; poet &quot;Tao Yuanming&quot;, the Yongming epoch poets, and the poems collected in the anthology &quot;New Songs from the Jade Terrace&quot;, compiled by Xu Ling (507–83). The general and poet Lu Ji used Neo-Taoist cosmology to take literary theory in a new direction with his Wen fu, or &quot;Essay on Literature&quot; in the Fu poetic form.

==Tang poetry==

A high point of classical Chinese poetry occurred during the Tang period (618–907): not only was this period prolific in poets; but, also in poems (perhaps around 50,000 poems survive, many of them collected in the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot;). During the time of, poetry was integrated into almost every aspect of the professional and social life of the literate class, including becoming part of the Imperial examinations taken by anyone wanting a government post. By this point, poetry was being composed according to regulated tone patterns. Regulated and unregulated poetry were distinguished as &quot;ancient-style&quot; &quot;gushi&quot; poetry and regulated, &quot;recent-style&quot; &quot;jintishi&quot; poetry. Jintishi (meaning &quot;new style poetry&quot;), or regulated verse, is a stricter form developed in the early Tang dynasty with rules governing the structure of a poem, in terms of line-length, number of lines, tonal patterns within the lines, the use of rhyme, and a certain level of mandatory parallelism. Good examples of the &quot;gushi&quot; and &quot;jintishi&quot; forms can be found in, respectively, the works of the poets Li Bai and Du Fu. Tang poetic forms include: &quot;lushi&quot;, a type of regulated verse with an eight-line form having five, six, or seven characters per line; &quot;ci&quot; (verse following set rhythmic patterns); and &quot;jueju&quot; (truncated verse), a four-line poem with five, six, or seven characters per line. Good examples of the &quot;jueju&quot; verse form can be found in the poems of Li Bai and Wang Wei. Over time, some Tang poetry became more realistic, more narrative and more critical of social norms; for example, these traits can be seen in the works of Bai Juyi. The poetry of the Tang dynasty remains influential today. Other Late Tang poetry developed a more allusive and surreal character, as can be seen, for example, in the works of Li He and Li Shangyin.

==Song poetry==

By the Song dynasty (960–1279), another form had proven it could provide the flexibility that new poets needed: the &quot;ci&quot; (词/詞) lyric—new lyrics written according to the set rhythms of existing tunes. Each of the tunes had music that has often been lost, but having its own meter. Thus, each &quot;ci&quot; poem is labeled &quot;To the tune of [Tune Name]&quot; (调寄[词牌]/調寄[詞牌]) and fits the meter and rhyme of the tune (much in the same way that Christian hymn writers set new lyrics to pre-existing tunes). The titles of &quot;ci&quot; poems are not necessarily related to their subject matter, and many poems may share a title. In terms of their content, &quot;ci&quot; poetry most often expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona. However, great exponents of the form, such as the Southern Tang poet Li Houzhu and the Song dynasty poet Su Shi, used the &quot;ci&quot; form to address a wide range of topics.

==Yuan poetry==

Major developments of poetry during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) included the development of types of poetry written to fixed-tone patterns, such as for the Yuan opera librettos. After the Song dynasty, the set rhythms of the &quot;ci&quot; came to be reflected in the set-rhythm pieces of Chinese Sanqu poetry (散曲), a freer form based on new popular songs and dramatic arias, that developed and lasted into the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Examples can be seen in the work of playwrights Ma Zhiyuan 馬致遠 (–1330) and Guan Hanqing 關漢卿 ().

==Ming poetry==

The Ming dynasty (1368–1644) poets include Gao Qi (1336–1374), Li Dongyang (1447–1516), and Yuan Hongdao (1568–1610).

==Ming-Qing Transition==
Ming-Qing Transition includes the interluding/overlapping periods of the brief so-called Shun dynasty (also known as Dashun, 1644–1645) and the Southern Ming dynasty (1644 to 1662). One example of poets who wrote during the difficult times of the late Ming, when the already troubled nation was ruled by Chongzhen Emperor (reigned 1627 to 1644), the short-lived Dashun regime of peasant-rebel Li Zicheng, and then the Manchu Qing dynasty are the so-called Three Masters of Jiangdong: Wu Weiye (1609–1671), Qian Qianyi (1582–1664), and Gong Dingzi (1615–1673).

==Qing poetry==

The Qing dynasty (1644 to 1912) is notable in terms of development of the criticism of poetry and the development of important poetry collections, such as the Qing era collections of Tang dynasty poetry known as the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot; and the &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;. Both &quot;shi&quot; and &quot;ci&quot; continued to be composed beyond the end of the imperial period.

==Post-imperial Classical Chinese poetry==
Both &quot;shi&quot; and &quot;ci&quot; continued to be composed past the end of the imperial period; one example being Mao Zedong, former Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, who wrote Classical Chinese poetry in his own calligraphic style.

==Modern (post-classical) poetry==

Modern Chinese poetry (新诗/新詞 &quot;new poetry&quot;) refers to the modern vernacular style of poetry, as opposed to the traditional poetry written in Classical Chinese language. Usually Modern Chinese poetry does not follow prescribed patterns. Poetry was revolutionized after 1919&#x27;s May Fourth Movement, when writers (like Hu Shih) tried to use vernacular styles related with folksongs and popular poems such as &quot;ci&quot; closer to what was being spoken (baihua) rather than previously prescribed forms. Early 20th-century poets like Xu Zhimo, Guo Moruo (later moved to the proletarian literature) and Wen Yiduo sought to break Chinese poetry from past conventions by adopting Western models. For example, Xu consciously follows the style of the Romantic poets with end-rhymes.

In the post-revolutionary Communist era, poets like Ai Qing used more liberal running lines and direct diction, which were vastly popular and widely imitated.

At the same time, modernist poetry, including avant-garde and surrealism, flourished in Taiwan, as exemplified by the poetry of Qin Zihao (1902–1963) and Ji Xian (b. 1903). Most influential poetic groups were founded in 1954 the &quot;Modernist School&quot;, the &quot;Blue Star&quot;, and the &quot;Epoch&quot;.

In the contemporary poetic scene, the most important and influential poets are in the group known as Misty Poets, who use oblique allusions and hermetic references. The most important Misty Poets include Bei Dao, Duo Duo, Shu Ting, Yang Lian, and Gu Cheng, most of whom were exiled after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. A special case is the mystic poet Hai Zi, who became very famous after his suicide.

In the early twenty-first century, many of the traditional uses of Chinese poetry remain intact in the modern era. These include relationships between politics and poetry, and also completely traditional practices in folk culture such as posting New Year&#x27;s couplets.
Following Taiwanese poets like Yu Kwang-chung, Yang Mu, Xi Murong and Yang Chia-hsien, many new-generation poets have emerged.

In May 2022, the &quot;New Century New Generation Poetry Selection&quot;, edited by Taiwanese poets Xiang Yang, targets the millennials poets (born between 1980 and 1999, active from 2000 to 2022) who created modern poetry in Taiwan. It includes 52 poets such as Liao Chi-Yu, Yang Chih-Chieh, Hsu Pei-Fen, Zhuxue Deren, Tsao Yu-Po and Lin Yu-Hsuan.

In February 2024, Zhuxue Deren&#x27;s poem &quot;Moon Museum&quot; was selected by the Arch Mission Foundation for the Arch Lunar Art Archive. The poem was carried to the Moon by the Odysseus lunar lander for permanent preservation, making it the earliest known Chinese poem to land on the Moon.

However, even today, the concept of &quot;modern poetry&quot; is still debated. There are arguments and contradiction as to whether &quot;modern poetry&quot; counts as poetry. Due to the special structure of Chinese writing and Chinese grammar, &quot;modern poetry,&quot; or &quot;free verse&quot; poetry, may seem like a simple short vernacular essay since they lack some of the structure traditionally used to define poetry.

<text>Classical Chinese poetry is traditional Chinese poetry written in Classical Chinese and typified by certain traditional forms, or modes; traditional genres; and connections with particular historical periods, such as the poetry of the Tang dynasty. The existence of classical Chinese poetry is documented at least as early as the publication of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; (&quot;Shijing&quot;). Various combinations of forms and genres have developed over the ages. Many or most of these poetic forms were developed by the end of the Tang dynasty, in 907 CE.

The use and development of Classical Chinese poetry actively continued up until the May Fourth Movement, in 1919, and is still developed even today. Poetry created during this period of more-or-less continuous development displays a great deal of diversity – categorized by both major historical periods and by dynastic periods (the traditional Chinese historical method).

Another key aspect of Classical Chinese poetry is its intense inter-relationship with other forms of Chinese art, such as Chinese painting and Chinese calligraphy. Classical Chinese poetry has proven to be of immense influence upon poetry worldwide.

==History and development==
The stylistic development of Classical Chinese poetry consists of both literary and oral cultural processes. These are usually divided into certain standard periods or eras, in terms both of specific poems as well as characteristic styles; these generally correspond to Chinese dynastic eras, per the traditional Chinese method of chronicling history. The poems preserved in writing form the poetic literature. Parallel traditions of oral and traditional poetry known as popular or folk poems or ballads also exist. Some of these poems have been preserved in written form. Generally, folk-type poems are anonymous, and many show signs of having been edited or polished in the process of recording them in written characters. The main source sources for the earliest preserved poems are the &quot;Classic of Poetry (Shijing)&quot; and the &quot;Songs of the South&quot; (&quot;Chuci&quot;). Some individual pieces or fragments survive in other forms – embedded, for example, in classical histories or other literature.
During the Tang dynasty poetry was very important

=== &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; (&quot;Shijing&quot;) ===


The literary tradition of Classical Chinese poetry begins with the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, or &quot;Shijing&quot;, dated to early 1st millennium BC. According to tradition, Confucius (551 BCE – 479 BCE) was the final editor of the collection in its present form, although the individual poems were mostly older than this. Burton Watson dates the anthology&#x27;s main compilation date to about the 7th century BCE, with the poems having been collected over the previous four to five centuries before. This, among other factors, indicates a sustained cross-class popularity for this type of poetry, including their characteristic four-character per line meter. The &quot;Shijing&quot; tends to be associated with northern Chinese vocabulary and culture, and in particular with the great sage and philosopher Confucius: this helped encourage the development of this type of poetry into the &quot;classic shi&quot; style, the literal meaning of &quot;Shijing&quot;. Despite their commendation by Confucius, there are no extant samples of any poetry of this style made within the next three hundred years.

===&quot;Songs of the South&quot; (&quot;Chu Ci&quot;)===
Another early poetry collection/genre is the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; (dated to the Warring States period about 475–221 BCE), which is typified by various line lengths and the imagery and influence of the vernacular associated with the state of Chu, in southern China. One important part of this is the Li Sao, attributed to Qu Yuan. These poems from the State of Chu are among the most important of all Classical Chinese poetry; however, these poems and their style seem to have had less influence on Classical Chinese poetry, at least at first, than did the &quot;Shijing&quot; collection and style.

===Han dynasty===
The classic &quot;shi&quot; poetry, with its four-character lines, was revived by Han and Three Kingdoms poets, to some extent. Among other poetic developments during the Han epoch was the development of a new form of &quot;shi&quot; poetry, dating from about the 1st century BCE, which initially consisted of &quot;five-&quot; and later &quot;seven-&quot;character lines. The development of this form of &quot;shi&quot; poetry occurred in conjunction with various other phenomena related to Han poetry. The new form of &quot;shi&quot; developed during the Han and the &quot;Jian&#x27;an&quot; period would become known as &quot;gushi&quot;, or &quot;ancient style poetry&quot;.

====Music Bureau and folk ballads====
The Han dynasty witnessed major developments in Classical Chinese poetry, including both the active role of the imperial government in encouraging poetry through the Music Bureau and through its collection of Han dynasty folk ballads (although some of these seem to have been subject to at least some post-folk literary polishing, as in the case of the &quot;Shijing&quot;). In Chinese, &quot;Yuefu&quot;, &quot;Music Bureau&quot;, is synonymous with &quot;yuefu&quot; the poetry style, thus the term &quot;Yuefu&quot; () has come to refer both to the Music Bureau&#x27;s collected lyrics and to the genre of which they are representative and serve as a source of inspiration. Another important Han dynasty poetry collection is the &quot;Nineteen Old Poems&quot;.

==== Han &quot;fu&quot; ====
The Han dynasty poetry is particularly associated with the &quot;fu&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;shi&quot; style of poetry or literature: note, however, that this &quot;fu&quot; () is a different word than the &quot;fu&quot; () meaning &quot;government bureau&quot; in the term &quot;yuefu&quot; (; sometimes spelled &quot;Yüeh Fu&quot;, or similarly).

The most celebrated exponent of this style was Sima Xiangru. Yang Xiong, Ban Gu and Zhang Heng were also important &quot;fu&quot; writers.

===Jian&#x27;an poetry===
Jian&#x27;an poetry refers to those poetic movements occurring during the final years of the failing Han dynasty and continuing their development into the beginning of the Six Dynasties period. Jian&#x27;an is considered as a separate period because this is one case where the poetic developments fail to correspond with the neat categories aligned to chronology by dynasty. Typical poets of this period are Cao Cao, Cao Pi, Cao Zhi, and Xu Gan. One of the more important poetic developments of this period is toward the odd number, fixed length verse styles also typical of the Tang poetry period. As a result, some of the poetic forms often associated with Tang poetry can be traced back developmentally to some of the forms developed during the Jian&#x27;an period.

===Six Dynasties poetry===
The Six Dynasties (220–589) also witnessed major developments in Classical Chinese poetry, especially emphasizing romantic love, gender roles, and human relationships, and including the important collection New Songs from the Jade Terrace. The Six Dynasties era covers three main periods: the Three Kingdoms (220–280), Jin dynasty (266–420), and Southern and Northern dynasties (420–589). The Three Kingdoms period was a violent one, a characteristic sometimes reflected in the poetry or highlighted by the poets&#x27; seeking refuge from the social and political turmoil by retreating into more natural settings, as in the case of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. The Jin dynasty era was typified poetically by, for example, the Orchid Pavilion Gathering of 42 literati; the romantic Midnight Songs poetry; and, Tao Yuanming, the great and highly personal poet who was noted for speaking in his own voice rather than a persona. Some of the highlights of the poetry of the Northern and Southern Dynasties include the &quot;Yongming&quot; poets, the anthology collection &quot;New Songs from the Jade Terrace&quot;, and Su Hui&#x27;s Star Gauge.

===Sui and Tang dynasties poetry===

====Sui poetry====

Although poetry continued to be written, and certain poets rose in prominence while others disappeared from the landscape, the brief Sui dynasty (581–618 CE) lacks distinction (in terms of the development of Chinese poetry); though it nonetheless represents a continuity between the Six Dynasties and the poetry of Tang. Sui dynasty poets include Yang Guang (580–618), who was the last Sui emperor (and a sort of poetry critic); and also, the Lady Hou, one of his consorts.

====Tang poetry====
The Tang dynasty (618–907) was particularly noted for its poetry, especially the &quot;shi&quot; forms such as &quot;jueju&quot; and &quot;lüshi&quot;. This poetry was both a pervasive social phenomenon throughout the Tang literate classes, who developed the ability to compose poems on demand as part of the Imperial examination system, but also a social grace necessary for polite conduct on social occasions, such as part of the interaction at banquets or social gatherings. Some 50,000 poems survive, mostly represented in the Ming dynasty collection the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot;. Their popularity in the historical Chinese cultural area has varied over time, with certain authors coming in and out of favor and others permanently obscure. Some authors, such as Li Bai (also known as Li Po), Du Fu, Wang Wei, Li Shangyin and Bai Juyi (also known as Po Chü-i) managed to maintain consistent popularity.

Tang poetry has developed an ongoing influence on world literature and modern and quasi-modern poetry; for instance, as in the case of Li Bai whose modern influence extends as far as Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot; and Beat poetry. In part because of the prevalence of rhymed and parallel structures within Tang poetry, it also has a role in linguistics studies, such as in the reconstruction of Middle Chinese pronunciation.

===Song dynasty poetry===
The Song dynasty (960–1279) was noted for its poetry, perhaps especially the development of the &quot;Ci&quot; form; indeed, the &quot;ci&quot; as a poetic form perhaps reached a high point during the Song dynasty. The &quot;ci&quot; is a kind of lyric poetry using a poetic meter based upon certain patterns of fixed-rhythm formal types, of which there were about 800 of these set patterns, each associated with a particular title. Originally &quot;ci&quot; were written to be sung to a specific tune of that title, with set rhythm, rhyme, and tempo. However, over time the actual tunes seem to have disappeared (similarly to the case of English ballads). Thus, the title of a certain &quot;ci&quot; may have nothing to do with its contents, although the poetic meter is the same. It is common for several &quot;ci&quot; to share the same title. As developed during the Song poetic period, the &quot;ci&quot; was a versatile verse form. The most prominent ci-poets include Su Shi (Dongpo), Xin Qiji, Li Qingzhao, Liu Yong and Zhou Bangyan.

The &quot;shi&quot; of the Song dynasty drew on a long tradition of poetry, perhaps especially the &quot;shi&quot; forms which were prevalent in the Tang dynasty. The Song dynasty is known for its achievements in the combination of shi, painting, and calligraphy into a shared art form. Prominent Song shi-poets include Su Shi (Dongpo), Huang Tingjian, Ouyang Xiu, Lu You and Yang Wanli.

The Southern Song dynasty which ruled southern China from 1127 to 1279 was largely co-existent with the Jurchen Jin dynasty (1115–1234), which had established control over northern China and its largely Chinese population. The Chinese poets of the Jin dynasty produced poetry which shared the characteristics of the Song dynasty poetry; and towards the end of the Jin, the poetry begins to similarly show the effects of the Mongol invasions that eventually led to the establishment of the Yuan dynasty with its own characteristic poetry. By far the greatest of Jin dynasty poets was Yuan Haowen. After the fall of the Jin, he lived on for several more decades under the Yuan. According to the Japanese scholar Yoshikawa Kōjirō, Yuan Haowen &quot;may well be the foremost Chinese poet from Du Fu to the present&quot; (John Timothy Wixted&#x27;s translation).

===Yuan dynasty poetry===
Poetry during the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) continued the Classical Chinese poetry tradition and is especially noted for the burgeoning of Chinese opera verse tradition. Yuan drama&#x27;s notable &quot;qu&quot; form was set to music, restricting each individual poem to one of nine modal key selections and one of over two hundred tune patterns. Depending on the pattern, this imposed fixed rhythmic and tonal requirements that remained in place for future poets even if its musical component was later lost. A full drama is called &quot;zaju&quot;. Besides &quot;zaju&quot;, some poets wrote &quot;qu&quot; form of poems independent of a drama. This kind of independent &quot;qu&quot; is called &quot;sanqu&quot;. &quot;Sanqu&quot; is classified into &quot;xiaoling&quot;, a single song, and &quot;taoshu&quot;, a song suite formed by combining more than one &quot;xiaoling&quot;. A lot of writers wrote both full dramas as well as &quot;sanqu&quot;. Noteworthy Yuan &quot;qu&quot;-poets include Bai Pu, Guan Hanqing, Ma Zhiyuan, Zheng Guangzu and Qiao Ji.

One exponent of the popular West Lake landscape poetry that flourished at this time was the always skilful and elegant, if sometimes too facile, poet Zhang Kejiu.

Another interesting development during the Yuan dynasty was the incorporation into the Chinese literary canon of a cluster of gifted non-Han poets, such as the Khitan Yelü Chucai, the Muslim Sadula (&quot;perhaps the best poet of the Yuan&quot; according to Stephen H. West), the Ongüt Ma Zuchang and the Karluk Nai Xian.

A painter-poet tradition also thrived during the Yuan period, including masterful calligraphy done by, for example, Ni Zan and Wu Zhen. Another exemplar was Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322), a former official of the Song dynasty who served under the Mongol administration of the Yuan and whose wife Guan Daosheng (1262–1319) was also a painter-poet and calligrapher.

===Ming dynasty poetry===

Classical Chinese poetry continued to thrive during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Ming prosperity was accompanied by a tremendous increase in population, commerce, and poetry composition. Thanks to educational opportunities made possible by commercial printing and the reinvigorated examination system, a massively larger literate population emerged. This population relied on poetry to express personal emotion and to engage with each other socially. A debate as to whether the Tang or Song poets had achieved the highest heights of excellence solidified a collective opinion that past heights could not be surpassed. With over one million surviving Ming poems, modern critics and researchers have been unable to definitively answer whether that conviction is a prejudice or a fact.

Leading Ming poets include Gao Qi, Li Dongyang, and the publisher-poet Yuan Hongdao. Representatives of the dramatist-poet tradition include Tang Xianzu and Li Yu. Li Yu is also a prime example of the Ming-Qing transition&#x27;s emotional outpouring when disorder swept away Ming stability as the incoming dynasty&#x27;s Manchu warriors conquered from North to South. Another example of the poetic focus on emotion during this period is Dong Xiaowan. Ming representatives of the painter-poet tradition include Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, and Wen Zhengming.

===Qing dynasty poetry===

Classical Chinese poetry continued to be the major poetic form of the Qing dynasty (1644–1912). This was also a time of related literary developments, such as the collection of Tang poetry under the Kangxi Emperor. The debates, trends, and widespread literacy of the Ming period began to flourish once again after the Qing dynasty had established its dominance. The fresh poetic voice of Yuan Mei has won wide appeal, as have the long narrative poems by Wu Jiaji. Kunqu opera matured and led toward the later Chinese opera tradition of combined drama, poetry, and music. The painter-poet tradition thrived with exemplars such as Yun Shouping.

The challenge for modern researchers grew as even more people became poets and even more poems were preserved, including (with Yuan Mei&#x27;s encouragement) more poetry by women. In 1980 fine &quot;shi&quot; poems by the famed Qing novelist Liu E were published for the first time, illustrating the potential to continue finding sunken treasure in the vast body of surviving Qing poetry.

===Post-Qing Classical Chinese poetry===
Although Qing is the last Chinese dynasty, this did not mean that Classical Chinese poetry disappeared with the end of the imperial period; indeed, Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party was a major exponent and practitioner of Classical Chinese poetry well into the 20th century. However, the development and great expansion of modern Chinese poetry is generally thought to start at this point in history, or shortly afterwards.

==Oral versus written==

===Oral nature of poetry===
One important aspect of Classical Chinese poetry is that it was generally designed to be chanted or sung, with or without musical accompaniment. In fact, folk poetry, almost by definition, was orally composed and orally transmitted. This is because the &quot;folk&quot; were for the most part illiterate, as opposed to the generally literate scholarly classes; however, even the poems of the scholarly classes were intended to be sung or chanted.

===Characteristics of written poetry===
The particular characteristics of the Chinese writing system played an important role in Chinese poetry. In fact, a continuous poetic tradition in China was enabled in part by the fact that Chinese words can be represented by their corresponding Chinese characters semi-independently of their pronunciation (which extends to their use in classical versions of Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese). The pronunciations of spoken Chinese changed quite a bit over the course of time from the oldest surviving written Chinese poetry (in Old Chinese), through the Middle Chinese period (which included the Tang dynasty), and up into the Modern Chinese period. During this course of development, Classical Chinese evolved as a distinct literary language, distinct from the spoken vernacular. The tension between a spoken vernacular and a literary form of the language worked both ways, the poetry of literature can be seen to have &quot;various degrees of vernacular overlay&quot; and also the oral folk poetry sometimes were &quot;filled with literary phrases and constructions&quot;, perhaps due to the prestigious nature of the written language.

===Influence of Chinese writing system===

Scholars have also asked to what degree the pictorial element latent in Chinese characters informed Classical Chinese poetry. The etymology of Chinese characters is related but distinct from the evolution of the language itself. As is the case with many ancient writing systems, such as the Phoenician alphabet, many of the earliest characters likely began as pictograms, with a given word corresponding to a picture representing that idea. 

By the time of Classical Chinese poetry, a complex system of writing had evolved with many characters being composed of combinations of other characters, chosen for similarities of meaning and/or sound. The resulting strong graphical aspect, versus a weaker phonetic element (in comparison to other languages, such as English) is very important. However, different translators of Classical Chinese poetry have emphasized these elements in differing degrees. Sinologist and translator A. C. Graham cautions against overemphasizing this visual effect, which he says can &quot;...act on the imagination like blobs in the Rorschach test. It is rather difficult to estimate this effect since a habitual reader of Chinese is hardly conscious of it without deliberately analysing his reactions...Certainly one can give too much weight to the visual aspect of Chinese writing. Poems in China, as elsewhere, are firstly patterns of sound...&quot; However, Graham is in no way suggesting that the Chinese poet is unaware of the background considerations stemming from character construction.

==Forms==

There are various typical forms in which Classical Chinese poetry was written. These include the &quot;shi&quot;, the &quot;ci&quot;, and &quot;qu&quot;. The &quot;fu&quot; literary is also often considered to be within the category of poetry.

==Genres==

Various genres of Classical Chinese poems have been discerned, either by the composing poet or literary critics. The most widely accepted genres of Classical Chinese poetry include the landscape style poetry genres of Shanshui poetry, and Fields and Gardens poetry, which are associated with poets such as Tao Qian and Wang Wei.

==Features==
Besides various formal modes and genres, Classical Chinese poetry has several other typical features.

===Persona===

The use of a poetic persona is often encountered in Classical Chinese poetry, in which the author writes a poem from the viewpoint of some other person (or type of person). Often these persona types were quite conventional, such as the lonely wife left behind at home, the junior concubine ignored and sequestered in the imperial harem, or the soldier sent off to fight and die beyond the remote frontier.

===Sociopolitical criticism===
Many Classical Chinese poems can be read as a commentary upon current events and society. Sometimes this commentary is disguised through the use of symbolic imagery. One popular author who made commentary in this regard was Tang poet Bai Juyi.

===Imagery and symbolism===
Certain images and symbolism became quite conventional, and are key to understanding many of the Classical Chinese poems. For example, the falling autumn leaf can refer to personal or dynastic decline.

===Exile===

Many Classical Chinese poems were written as more-or-less subtle or implied complaints for the treatment of the author by the government. This is in part due to the nature of the imperial examination system as a way of recruiting talented persons into high political office, and the expectations of the talented poet of finding a suitable position within such a society. One example of this is the poetry written to accompany of to follow the eight-fold settings of the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang which were popularized during the Song dynasty; although, the theme can certainly be traced back as far as the &quot;Chuci&quot;.

===Allusions===

Many Classical Chinese poems involve allusions or references to previous literature or well-known folk material.

===Optional precision===
In part due to the possibilities inherent in the Classical Chinese language and in part as an esthetic principle, many Classical Chinese poems are imprecise when it comes to gender, number, case, or other logically informative elements of speech which tend to be grammatically obligatory or difficult to avoid in various inflected languages, such as certain Indo-European languages.

===Reader participation===
Many Classical Chinese poems appear simple on the surface, but contain deeper, more profound ideas. In order to realize what these are, the reader is expected to meet the poet halfway — not just to be told something, but to actively think and feel in sympathy with the poet or the poet&#x27;s persona.

===Parallelism and antithesis===

====Parallelism====
The arrangement of poems into couplets encouraged the use of parallelism: where for two lines of a poem it would be expected that the reader would compare and contrast the meaning of two lines, which would be specifically marked by the poet by using the same parts of speech in each position, or in certain key positions in each line, or else within one line.

====Antithesis====
Antithesis refers to the often latent contradiction between two statements which when sufficiently considered can lead to the understanding of a third, unstated opinion. It often plays a part in relationship to parallelism: the reader has to consider whether what seem to be parallel constructions and ideas really are so.

====Autobiographic occasionalism====
Many of the Classical Chinese poems were written on the occasion of a certain event. This was generally expected to be a fairly spontaneous creation made just for that particular period of time, and sometimes with a fairly limited intended audience in mind. Examples include occasions of parting from a close friend for an extended period of time, expression of gratitude for a gift or act of someone, lamentations about current events, or even as a sort of game at social gatherings.

==Collections==
Major collections of Classical Chinese poetry include the &quot;Shijing&quot;, the &quot;Chuci&quot;, the &quot;Complete Tang Poems&quot;, the &quot;New Songs from the Jade Terrace&quot;, the &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;, the Tang era &quot;Wangchuan ji&quot;, and the poems collected from the Orchid Pavilion Gathering and the Midnight Songs poems from the Six Dynasties period .

==Influence==
Classical Chinese poetry has been an influence both on modern Chinese poetry but also on the poetry of other languages. One group of languages on which Classical Chinese poetry had an early influence was the cultural exchange with various unrelated neighbouring language families that initiated diplomatic contact with Sinitic speakers. Such interaction happened with speakers of Austroasiatic, Japonic, Koreanic as well as Tungusic and Mongolic (Khitan in particular) languages. A more recent global influence has developed in modern times, including Beat poetry, exponents of which even produced translations of Classical Chinese poetry into English, such as Kenneth Rexroth (&quot;One Hundred Poems From the Chinese&quot;, 1956) and Gary Snyder (&quot;Riprap and Cold Mountain Poems&quot;, 1959, which includes translations of Hanshan).

===Translation into English===
Various translators have translated Classical Chinese poetry into English, including Ezra Pound—credited by T. S. Eliot with the &quot;invention of Chinese poetry in our time&quot;—as well as Arthur Waley, A. C. Graham, Kenneth Rexroth, Burton Watson, Jerome P. Seaton, and David Hinton.

<text>The Kingdom of Cyprus (; ) was a medieval kingdom of the Crusader states that existed between 1192 and 1489. Initially ruled as an independent Christian kingdom, it was established by the French House of Lusignan after the Third Crusade. It comprised not only the entire island of Cyprus, but it also had a foothold on the Anatolian mainland: Antalya between 1361 and 1373, and Corycus between 1361 and 1448.

==History==

===Medieval Cyprus===

After the division of the Roman Empire into an eastern half and a western half, Cyprus came under the rule of the Eastern Roman Empire. At that time, its bishop, while still subject to the Christian Church, was made autocephalous by the First Council of Ephesus in 431.

The Arab Muslims invaded Cyprus in force in the 650s, but in 688, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II and the Umayyad caliph ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Marwān reached an unprecedented agreement. For the next 300 years, Cyprus was ruled jointly by both the Arabs and the Byzantines as a &quot;condominium&quot;, despite the nearly constant warfare between the two parties on the mainland. The Byzantines recovered control over the island for short periods thereafter, but the &quot;status quo&quot; was always restored.

This period lasted until the year 965, when Niketas Chalkoutzes conquered the island for a resurgent Byzantium. In 1185, the last Byzantine governor of Cyprus, Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus from a minor line of the Imperial house, rose in rebellion, and attempted to seize the throne. His attempted coup was unsuccessful, but Komnenos was able to retain control of the island. Byzantine actions against Komnenos failed because he enjoyed the support of William II of Sicily. The Byzantine emperor had an agreement with the sultan of Egypt to close Cypriot harbours to the Crusaders.

===Third Crusade===

The island of Cyprus was conquered in 1191 by King Richard I of England during the Third Crusade, from Isaac Komnenos, an upstart local governor, Byzantine Prince and self-proclaimed emperor of the Byzantine Empire. The English king did not intend to conquer the island until his fleet was scattered by a storm en route to the siege of Acre (1189–1191). The three ships were wrecked and sank in sight of the port of Limassol. The shipwrecked survivors were taken prisoner by Komnenos and when a ship bearing King Richard&#x27;s sister Joan and bride Berengaria entered the port, Komnenos refused their request to disembark for fresh water. King Richard and the rest of his fleet arrived shortly afterwards. Upon hearing of the imprisonment of his shipwrecked comrades and the insults offered to his bride and sister, King Richard met Komnenos in battle. There were rumours that Komnenos was secretly in agreement with Saladin in order to protect himself from his enemies, the Angelos family, the ruling family in the Byzantine capital of Constantinople.

Control of the island of Cyprus would give King Richard an extremely valuable strategic base to launch further Crusade operations. The English army engaged the Cypriots on the shores of Limassol with English archers and heavily armored knights. Komnenos and the remainder of the army escaped to the hills during nightfall, but King Richard and his troops tracked the Cypriot ruler down and raided his camp before dawn. Komnenos escaped again with a small number of men. The next day, many Cypriot nobles came to King Richard to swear fealty.

Fearing treachery at the hands of the new invaders, Komnenos fled after making this pledge to King Richard and escaped to the stronghold of Kantara. Some weeks after King Richard&#x27;s marriage to his bride in Limassol on 12 May 1191, Komnenos attempted an escape by boat to the mainland but he was apprehended at Cape St. Andrea and later imprisoned in the castle of Markappos in Syria, where he died shortly afterwards, still in captivity. Meanwhile, King Richard resumed his journey to Acre and, with much needed respite, new funds and reinforcements, set sail for the Holy Land accompanied by the King of Jerusalem, Guy of Lusignan and other high ranking nobles. The English king left garrisons in the towns and castles of the island before he departed and the island itself was left in charge of Richard of Canville and Robert of Thornham.

Richard confiscated the property of those Cypriots who had fought against him. He also imposed a 50% capital levy on the island in return for confirming its laws and customs. He also ordered Cypriot men to shave their beards. There was a rebellion led by a relative of Isaac&#x27;s, but it was crushed by Robert of Thornham, who hanged the leader. Richard rebuked Robert for this execution, since executing a man who claimed to be king was an affront to royal dignity. Some details of the brief English period on Cyprus can be found in the &quot;Chronicle of Meaux Abbey&quot;, possibly derived from Robert of Thornham, who had a relationship with the abbey.

===Knights Templar===
When King Richard I of England realized that Cyprus would prove to be a difficult territory to maintain and oversee whilst launching offensives in the Holy Land, he sold it to the Knights Templar for a fee of 100,000 bezants, 40,000 of which was to be paid immediately, while the remainder was to be paid in installments. One of the greatest military orders of medieval times, the Knights Templar were renowned for their remarkable financial power and vast holdings of land and property throughout Europe and the East. Their severity of rule in Cyprus quickly incurred the hatred of the native population. On Easter Day in 1192, the Cypriots attempted a massacre of their Templar rulers; however, due to prior knowledge of the attack and limited numbers of troops, the Knights had taken refuge in their stronghold at Nicosia. A siege ensued and the Templars, realizing their dire circumstances and their besiegers&#x27; reluctance to bargain, sallied out into the streets at dawn one morning, taking the Cypriots completely by surprise. The subsequent slaughter was merciless and widespread and though Templar rule was restored following the event, the military order was reluctant to continue rule and allegedly begged King Richard to take Cyprus back. King Richard took them up on the offer and the Templars returned to Syria, retaining but a few holdings on the island. A small minority Roman Catholic population of the island was mainly confined to some coastal cities, such as Famagusta, as well as inland Nicosia, the traditional capital. Roman Catholics kept the reins of power and control, while the Orthodox inhabitants lived in the countryside; this was much the same as the arrangement in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The independent Eastern Orthodox Church of Cyprus, with its own Archbishop and subject to no patriarch, was allowed to remain on the island, but the Roman Catholic Latin Church largely displaced it in stature and holding property.

===Guy and Amalric===

In the meantime, the hereditary queen of Jerusalem, Sybilla, had died, and opposition to the rule of her husband, king consort Guy of Lusignan, greatly increased to the point that he was ousted from his claim to the crown of Jerusalem. Since Guy was a long-time vassal of King Richard, the English king looked to strike two birds with one stone; by offering Guy de Lusignan the kingdom of Cyprus, he allowed his friend the opportunity to save face and keep some sort of power in the East whilst simultaneously ridding himself of a troublesome fief. It is unclear whether King Richard gave him the territory or sold it and it is highly unlikely that King Richard was ever paid, even if a deal was struck.
In 1194, Guy de Lusignan died without any heirs and so his older brother, Amalric, became King Amalric I of Cyprus, a crown and title which was approved by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor.

After the death of Amalric of Lusignan, the Kingdom continually passed to a series of young boys who grew up as king. The Ibelin family, which had held much power in Jerusalem prior its downfall, acted as regents during these early years. In 1229, one of the Ibelin regents was forced out of power by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, who brought the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines to the island. Frederick&#x27;s supporters were defeated in this struggle by 1232 from the Cypriots Forces at Battle of Agridi, although it lasted longer in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and in the Holy Roman Empire. Frederick&#x27;s Hohenstaufen descendants continued to rule as kings of Jerusalem until 1268 when Hugh III of Cyprus claimed the title and its territory of Acre for himself upon the death of Conrad III of Jerusalem, thus uniting the two kingdoms. The territory in Palestine was finally lost while Henry II was king in 1291, but the kings of Cyprus continued to claim the title.

===Governance===
Like Jerusalem, Cyprus had a &quot;Haute Cour&quot; (High Court), although it was less powerful than it had been in Jerusalem. The island was richer and more feudal than Jerusalem, so the king had more personal wealth and could afford to ignore the Haute Cour. The most important vassal family was the multi-branch House of Ibelin. However, the king was often in conflict with the Italian merchants, especially because Cyprus had become the center of European trade with Africa and Asia after the fall of Acre in 1291.

The kingdom eventually came to be dominated more and more in the 14th century by the Genoese merchants, under the leadership of the Republic of Genoa. Cyprus therefore sided with the Avignon Papacy in the Great Schism, in the hope that the French would be able to drive out the Genoese. The Mameluks then made the kingdom a tributary state in 1426; the remaining monarchs gradually lost almost all independence, until 1489 when the last queen, Catherine Cornaro, was forced to sell the island to Venice.

==Economy==
The economy of Cyprus remained primarily agrarian during the Lusignan period. Simultaneously, though, the island grew in importance in the trade network connecting Western Europe and the Middle East, serving as an &quot;entrepôt&quot;. This led to an increase in demand on Cypriot products (most importantly sugar, but also wine, wheat, oil, carobs) abroad, and the agrarian economy became more export-oriented. This allowed Cyprus to become more prosperous relative to the Byzantine period, fuelling the development of the harbour of Famagusta and the capital Nicosia, enabling the construction of architectural works that survive to this day. Whilst the development of these two eclipsed the other towns, towns such as Limassol, Paphos and Kyrenia did take some part in the changing economic environment. Limassol, in particular, became a port for the export of agricultural products and served as a stopover for Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. The relative prosperity encouraged migration to Cyprus from the West (Genoa, Venice, Provence, Catalonia) and the East. The Latin immigrants participated in the economic life as merchants, artisans, shipwrights, ship captains and tavern keepers, and as such had an outsize share in the economy.

During this period, new industries also emerged in Cyprus. Cypriot pottery developed particular characteristics, and was exported to the Crusader States until the Fall of Acre in 1291. In the late 13th and early 14th industries, the textile industry developed, with new textile dyeing workshops being set up in Nicosia, and Cypriot samites and camlets having increasing demand in the West and the East. Famagusta became a hub for shipbuilding. These developments prompted the arrival of representatives from Florentine banking houses, such as the Peruzzi and the Bardi family. The growth of the industry as well as the labour-intensive production of sugar and wine resulted in a demand for slaves, and slave markets existed in Nicosia and Famagusta.

==Society and culture==
Cypriot society in the Lusignan period was multi-ethnic, with Orthodox Greek Cypriots making up the majority of the population. Greeks constituted the majority of the population in the rural areas, where they were either serfs (paroikoi) or free tenants (francomati). The population increased until the middle of the fourteenth century, but the Black Death in 1347-48 resulted in the loss of one fifth to one third of the population. Repeated outbreaks prevented population recovery into the fifteenth century. In the 14th century it was common for Cypriot nobility to receive their education in Constantinople.

Cyprus during this period had a vibrant court culture, in which popular pastimes of the day were practised in a similar fashion to other European Christian societies. Music, poetry and other arts were enjoyed by both the aristocracy and middle ranks of society, as well as pursuits such as hunting.

The Roman Catholic Latins never exceeded a quarter of the island&#x27;s population and were concentrated in the cities. Frankish knights and aristocracy mostly lived in Nicosia, whilst Italians were concentrated in Famagusta. The losses suffered by the Crusader States in the 1270s and 1280s and the final Fall of Acre in 1291 triggered an influx of Latin immigrants from the Levant, as Italian, Aragonese and Provençal trading cities relocated their merchants to Cyprus. Maronites, Armenians and Syrians were concentrated in the foothills of Pentadaktylos and coastal plains. There was a system of ethnic discrimination and social stratification in place. However, with the majority of the population being Greeks, the Frankish nobility set up a system that would accommodate a certain degree of Greek autonomy, for instance maintaining Greek ecclesiastical courts open to the consultation of &quot;wise and prominent men&quot;, thus practically forming secular Greek forms that exercised a form of judicial autonomy. The Greek Cypriot dialect was used as the lingua franca on the island and legal texts were translated into the vernacular, like the Assizes of Jerusalem. This relative autonomy meant that there were no rebellions of ethnic character in the Lusignan period. Whilst Greek historiography has traditionally seen a peasant revolt in 1426-27 as a nationalistic uprising, this was an unsystematic series of riots of pillaging by segments of the Greek peasant population and Spanish mercenaries following the Mamluk invasion, the capture of King Janus and the political vacuum that ensued.

==List of monarchs of Cyprus==

==Pretenders of the Kingdom of Cyprus==
* Thierry of Flanders, who married the &quot;damsel of Cyprus&quot;, heiress of Isaac Komnenos, in the winter of 1202/1203, claimed the kingdom, but Aimery refused to surrender it.
* Eugene Matteo de Armenia (1480&#x27;s–1523), said by his own progeny to have been an illegitimate son of King James II of Cyprus and if born in the 1480s he was quite a posthumous specimen, alleged to have moved to Sicily then Malta, founder of the family of Baron di Baccari (Tal-Baqqar).
* Charlotte (d. 1487) and Louis (d. 1482), queen and king-consort, continued as pretenders, Charlotte renounced 1482 in favour of: 
* Charles I of Savoy (1482–1490), legitimate great-grandson of Janus of Cyprus, son of a first cousin of Charlotte, second cousin of James III, nephew of Louis
* Charles II of Savoy (1490–1496)
* Yolande Louise of Savoy (1496–1499) and Philibert II of Savoy (d. 1504)
** Philip II of Savoy (1496–1497), father of Philibert II, great-uncle of Charles II and of Yolande Louise, first cousin of Charlotte, maternal grandson of Janus of Cyprus.
* and several others. The rights diverted &quot;de jure&quot;, but were claimed by the male line. See further under Cypriot claimants under Kings of Jerusalem. By 1476, the various claims were so diverse and weak that various monarchs sought former Cypriot queens to cede them their rights. Even the Republic of Venice briefly entertained the idea of setting up Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, the brother-in-law of England&#x27;s King Edward IV (who was secretly negotiating a marriage to the Scottish princess Cecilia on Anthony&#x27;s behalf), as a claimant by purchasing the rights of former Cypriot queens Charlotte and Catarina Cornaro. A convention in Venice of 1476 declared &quot;Anthony Arnite&quot; heir to the combined kingdom of Jerusalem-Cyprus but this came to nought when Anthony died before even his marriage to the sister of James Stewart, King of Scots could be celebrated, and the former Cypriot queens ceded their rights elsewhere: Charlotte to the Italian house of Savoy and Catarina Cornaro to the Most Serene Republic of Venice which asserted its claim to the kingdom as part of the republic, without even a candidate for king.
* In 1880, a former Maronite priest Kalfa Narbei declared that he was a descendant of Guy de Lusignan and styled himself as the Prince of Lusignan of Cyprus, of Jerusalem and of Armenia. He took the name Guy de Lusignan and title of Prince. He started offering self-styled chivalric orders. After the death of Guy/Kalfa Narbei in 1905, his wife Marie&#x27;s lover became the alleged Grand Master and called himself Comte d&#x27;Alby de Gratigny. He became involved in a fake art scandal in 1910.

<text>Human positions refer to the different physical configurations that the human body can take.
There are several synonyms that refer to human positioning, often used interchangeably, but having specific nuances of meaning.
*&quot;Position&quot; is a general term for a configuration of the human body.
*&quot;Posture&quot; means an intentionally or habitually assumed position.
*&quot;Pose&quot; implies an artistic, aesthetic, athletic, or spiritual intention of the position.
*&quot;Attitude&quot; refers to postures assumed for purpose of imitation, intentional or not, as well as in some standard collocations in reference to some distinguished types of posture: &quot;Freud never assumed a fencer&#x27;s attitude, yet almost all took him for a swordsman.&quot;
*&quot;Bearing&quot; refers to the manner of the posture, as well as of gestures and other aspects of the conduct taking place.

==Basic positions==
While not moving, a human is usually in one of the following basic positions:

===All-fours===
This is the static form of crawling which is a form of locomotion instinctive in very young children. It was a commonly used childbirth position in both Western and non-Western cultures, in which context it is known as the Gaskin Maneuver. This position is sometimes viewed as sexually explicit due to its association with sexual initiation or availability.

===Kneeling===
Kneeling is a basic human position where one or both knees touch the ground. It is used as a resting position, during childbirth and as an expression of reverence and submission. While kneeling, the angle between the legs can vary from zero to widely splayed out, flexibility permitting. It is common to kneel with one leg and squat with the other leg.

While kneeling, the thighs and upper body can be at various angles in particular:
* Vertical kneel: where both the thighs and upper body are vertical – also known as &quot;standing on one&#x27;s knees&quot;
* Sitting kneel: where the thighs are near horizontal and the buttocks sit back on the heels with the upper body vertical - for example as in Seiza, Virasana, and Vajrasana (yoga)
* Taking a knee: where the upper body is vertical, one knee is touching the ground while the foot of the other leg is placed on the ground in front of the body
===Lying===

When in lying position, the body may assume a great variety of shapes and positions. The following are the basic recognized positions:
*Supine position: lying on the back with the face up
*Prone position: lying on the chest with the face down (&quot;lying down&quot; or &quot;going prone&quot;)
*Lying on either side, with the body straight or bent/curled forward or backward
*Fetal position: is lying or sitting curled, with limbs close to the torso and the head close to the knees
===Sitting===
Sitting requires the buttocks resting on a more or less horizontal structure, such as a chair or the ground. Special ways of sitting are with the legs horizontal, and in an inclined seat. While on a chair the shins are usually vertical, on the ground the shins may be crossed in the lotus position or be placed horizontally under the thigh in a seiza.
===Squatting or crouching===

Squatting is a posture where the weight of the body is on the feet (as with standing) but the knees and hips are bent. In contrast, sitting, involves taking the weight of the body, at least in part, on the buttocks against the ground or a horizontal object such as a chair seat. The angle between the legs when squatting can vary from zero to widely splayed out, flexibility permitting. Squatting may be either:
* full – known as full squat, deep squat, grok squat, Asian squat, third world squat, (sitting) on one&#x27;s haunches, (sitting) on one&#x27;s hunkers, or hunkering (down)
* partial – known as partial, standing, half, semi, parallel, shallow, intermediate, incomplete, or monkey squat

Crouching is usually considered to be synonymous with full squatting. It is common to squat with one leg and kneel with the other leg. One or both heels may be up when squatting. Young children often instinctively squat. Among Chinese, Southeast Asian, and Eastern European adults, squatting often takes the place of sitting or standing. 
===Standing===
Although quiet standing appears to be static, modern instrumentation shows it to be a process of rocking from the ankle in the sagittal plane. The sway of quiet standing is often likened to the motion of an inverted pendulum. There are many mechanisms in the body that are suggested to control this movement, e.g. a spring action in muscles, higher control from the nervous system or core muscles.

Although the posture is not dangerous in itself, there are pathologies associated with prolonged intervals of unrelieved standing. One short-term condition is orthostatic hypotension, and long-term conditions are sore feet, stiff legs, and low back pain.

Some variations of standing are:
* Standing with arms &quot;akimbo&quot;, that is with hands on hips, elbows pointing outward
* Standing with folded arms
* Standing contrapposto, with most of the weight on one foot so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs in the axial plane
* Standing at attention, upright with an assertive and correct posture: &quot;chin up, chest out, shoulders back, stomach in&quot;, arms at the side, heels together, toes apart

==Contexts==

===Asanas===

Certain asanas postures were originally intended primarily to restore and maintain a practitioner&#x27;s well-being, to improve the body&#x27;s flexibility and vitality, and to promote the ability to remain in seated meditation for extended periods.

===Atypical positions===
Atypical positions are common to break dancing, gymnastics, and yoga, and may include:
* standing on one leg
* handstand
* head stand
* spreadeagle
* crab position

The human body can be suspended in various stable positions, where the support is above the center of gravity. The positioning may be voluntary or involuntary.

===Childbirth positions===

In addition to the lithotomy position still commonly used by many obstetricians, childbirth positions that are successfully used by midwives and traditional birth-attendants the world over include squatting, standing, kneeling, and on all fours, often in a sequence.

===Dance positions===
Dance position is a position of a dancer or a mutual position of a dance couple assumed during a dance. Describing and mastering proper dance positions is an important part of dance technique.
===Eating positions===
Eating positions vary in different regions of the world, as culture strongly influences the way people eat their meals. For example, in most of the Middle Eastern countries, eating while sitting on the floor is most common, and it is believed to be healthier than eating while sitting at a table.

Eating in a reclining position was favored by the Ancient Greeks at a celebration they called a symposium, and this custom was adopted by the Ancient Romans. Ancient Hebrews also adopted this posture for traditional celebrations of a Passover Seder, to symbolize freedom. The biblical prophet Amos associates &quot;those who recline at banquets&quot; with the false sense of security among the Israelites whom he is warning to repent.
===Heat escape lessening position===

The heat escape lessening position (HELP) is a way to position oneself to reduce heat loss in cold water. It is taught as part of the curriculum in Australia, North America, and Ireland for lifeguard and boating safety training. It essentially involves positioning one&#x27;s knees together and hugging them close to the chest using one&#x27;s arms.
===Medical positions===
The following positions are specifically used in medicine:
===Recovery position===

The recovery position or coma position refers to one of a series of variations on a lateral recumbent or three-quarters prone position of the body, into which an unconscious but breathing casualty can be placed as part of first aid treatment.

===Resting positions===
A large number of resting positions are possible, based on variations of sitting, squatting, kneeling or lying.

===Riding positions===
A &quot;straddle&quot; or &quot;astride&quot; position is usually adopted when riding a horse, donkey, or other beast of burden, with or without the aid of a saddle. The position is also used for sitting on analogous vehicles, such as bicycles, motorcycles, or unicycles, and 
on furniture, such as certain types of seating, and bidets. The posture is also used on some types of specialized workbenches (such as a shaving horse). By definition, an essential feature is having one leg on each side of whatever is being straddled. The related sidesaddle position allows riding &quot;without&quot; straddling, but is somewhat less secure against accidental dismounting or falling.

The straddle posture is often intermediate between standing and sitting positions, allowing body weight to be supported securely, while also affording a high degree of upper body mobility and dynamic balance during vigorous or extended motions.

===Sex positions===

Sex positions are positions which people may adopt during or for the purpose of sexual intercourse or other sexual activities. Sexual acts are generally described by the positions the participants adopt in order to perform those acts.

===Shooting positions===

* Kneeling position
* Prone position
* Standing position
* Sitting
* Squatting

===Sleeping positions===

The sleeping position is the body configuration assumed by a person during or prior to sleeping. Six basic sleeping positions have been identified:
* Fetus (41%) – curling up in a fetal position. This was the most common position, and is especially popular with women.
* Log (15%) – lying on one&#x27;s side with the arms down the side.
* Yearner (13%) – sleeping on one&#x27;s side with the arms in front.
* Soldier (8%) – on one&#x27;s back with the arms pinned to the sides.
* Freefall (7%) – on one&#x27;s front with the arms around the pillow and the head tilted to one side.
* Starfish (5%) – on one&#x27;s back with the arms around the pillow.

===Stress positions===

Stress positions place the human body in such a way that a great amount of weight is placed on just one or two muscles and joints. Forcing prisoners to adopt such positions is a method of ill-treatment used for extracting information or as a punishment, possibly amounting to torture. Such positions also are sometimes used as a punishment for children.

===Submissive positions===
Submissive positions are often ceremonial and dictated by culture. They may be performed as a mutual sign of respect between equals or as a sign of submission to a higher-ranking individual or to a ceremonial object.
* Bowing is the lowering of the head and torso towards the person or object of reverence, often briefly. The extent of a bow ranges from a simple head nod to a 90–degree bending at the waist. Though less common in Western cultures, it remains an important sign of respect in many Eastern cultures, and is also used in the ceremonies of various religions.
** In bowing and scraping, the right hand is placed across the abdomen while the right leg is drawn or &quot;scraped&quot; back during a bow.
** In Western cultures, it is often considered proper for women to perform a curtsey by bending the knees instead of a bow.
* Genuflection (or genuflexion) is bending at least one knee to the ground, was from early times a gesture of deep respect for a superior.
* Kneeling is associated with reverence, submission and obeisance.
* Kowtowing is the act of deep respect shown by kneeling and bowing so low as to have one&#x27;s head touching the ground.
* Prostration is the placement of the body in a reverentially or submissively prone position.

<text>The is a Japanese newspaper published in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and other major Japanese cities. It is one of the five major newspapers in Japan; the other four are &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot;, the &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot;, the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;, and the &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot;. It is headquartered in Otemachi, Chiyoda, Tokyo.&quot;

It is a newspaper that represents Tokyo and generally has a conservative orientation. It is one of Japan&#x27;s leading newspapers, along with the Osaka-based liberal (Third Way) &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; and the Nagoya-based social democratic &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot;. This newspaper is well known for its pro-American stance among major Japanese media.

It is published by regional bureaus, all of them subsidiaries of The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings, Japan&#x27;s largest media conglomerate by revenue and the second largest media conglomerate by size behind Sony, which is privately held by law and wholly owned by present and former employees and members of the Matsutarō Shōriki family. The Holdings has been part-owned by the family since Matsutarō Shōriki&#x27;s purchase of the newspaper in 1924 (currently owning a total of 45.26% stock); despite its control, the family is not involved in its executive operations.

Founded in 1874, the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; is credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world as of 2019, having a morning circulation of 7.0 million as of June 2021. The paper is printed twice a day and in several different local editions.

The &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; established the Yomiuri Prize in 1949. Its winners have included Yukio Mishima and Haruki Murakami.

==History==
The &quot;Yomiuri&quot; was launched in 1874 by the Nisshusha newspaper company as a small daily newspaper. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s the paper came to be known as a literary arts publication with its regular inclusion of work by writers such as Ozaki Kōyō.

In 1924, Matsutarō Shōriki took over management of the company. His innovations included improved news coverage, a full-page radio program guide, and the establishment of Japan&#x27;s first professional baseball team, now known as the Yomiuri Giants. The emphasis of the paper shifted to broad news coverage aimed at readers in the Tokyo area. By 1941 it had the largest circulation of any daily newspaper in the Tokyo area. In 1942, under wartime conditions, it merged with the &quot;Hochi Shimbun&quot; and became known as the &quot;Yomiuri-Hochi&quot;.

The &quot;Yomiuri&quot; was the center of a labor scandal in 1945 and 1946. In October 1945, a post-war &quot;democratization group&quot; called for Shōriki&#x27;s removal, as he supported Imperial Japan&#x27;s policies during World War II. When Shōriki responded by firing five of the leading members of this group, the writers and editors launched the first &quot;production control&quot; strike on 27 October 1945. This method of striking became an important union tactic in the coal, railroad, and other industries during the postwar period. Matsutarō Shōriki was arrested in December 1945 as a Class-A war criminal and sent to Sugamo Prison. The &quot;Yomiuri&quot;&#x27;s employees continued to produce the paper without heeding executive orders until a police raid on June 21, 1946. The charges against Shōriki were dropped and he was released in 1948. According to research by Professor Tetsuo Arima of Waseda University on declassified documents stored at NARA, he agreed to work with the CIA as an informant.

Under the leadership of Tsuneo Watanabe, who served as editor-in-chief from 1991 until his death in 2024, &quot;Yomiuri&quot; would gain considerable international prominence. By 1994, it would have a daily circulation which topped 10 million. In addition, it would also hold considerable influence over Japanese politics, with Watanabe even boasting that was Japan&#x27;s &quot;last dictator.&quot; In 2010, it would be recognized by Guinness World Records for having the highest daily newspaper circulation in the world, and also as the only newspaper with a morning circulation in excess of 10 million copies.

In February 2009, the &quot;Yomiuri&quot; entered into a tie-up with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; for editing, printing and distribution. Since March 2009 the major news headlines of the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s Asian edition have been summarized in Japanese in the evening edition of the &quot;Yomiuri&quot;.

The &quot;Yomiuri&quot; features an advice column, Jinsei Annai.

The &quot;Yomiuri&quot; has a history of promoting nuclear power in Japan. In May 2011, when Naoto Kan, then Prime Minister of Japan, asked the Chubu Electric Power Company to shut down several of its Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plants due to safety concerns, the &quot;Yomiuri&quot; called the request &quot;abrupt&quot; and a difficult situation for Chubu Electric&#x27;s shareholders. It wrote that Kan &quot;should seriously reflect on the way he made his request.&quot; It then followed up with an article wondering how dangerous Hamaoka really was and called Kan&#x27;s request &quot;a political judgment that went beyond technological worthiness.&quot; The next day damage to the pipes inside the condenser was discovered at one of the plants following a leak of seawater into the reactor.

In 2012, the paper reported that Nobutaka Tsutsui, the Minister for Agriculture, had divulged secret information to a Chinese enterprise. Tsutsui sued the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; for libel and was awarded 3.3 million yen in damages in 2015, on the basis that the truth of the allegations could not be confirmed.

In November 2014, the newspaper apologized after using the phrase &quot;sex slave&quot; to refer to comfort women, following its criticism of the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;″s coverage of Japan&#x27;s World War II comfort women system.

The &quot;Yomiuri&quot; newspaper said in an editorial in 2011 &quot;No written material supporting the claim that government and military authorities were involved in the forcible and systematic recruitment of comfort women has been discovered&quot;, and that it regarded the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund, set up to compensate for wartime abuses, as a failure based on a misunderstanding of history. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on similar statements previously, writing that &quot;The nation&#x27;s (Japan&#x27;s) largest newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, applauded the revisions&quot; regarding removing the word &quot;forcibly&quot; from referring to laborers brought to Japan in the pre-war period and revising the comfort women controversy. &quot;Yomiuri&quot; editorials have also opposed the DPJ government and denounced denuclearization as &quot;not a viable option&quot;.

==Other publications and ventures==
Yomiuri also publishes the daily English-language newspaper &quot;The Japan News&quot; (formerly called &quot;The Daily Yomiuri&quot;), established in 1955. Besides its news website, The Japan News also publishes a weekly e-paper.

It publishes the daily &quot;Hochi Shimbun&quot;, a sport-specific daily newspaper, as well as weekly and monthly magazines and books.

Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings owns the Chuokoron-Shinsha publishing company, which it acquired in 1999, and the Nippon Television network. It is a member of the Asia News Network. The paper is known as the financial patron of the baseball team Yomiuri Giants. They also sponsor the Japan Fantasy Novel Award annually. It has been a sponsor of the FIFA Club World Cup every time it has been held in Japan since 2006.

From 1949 through 1963, the newspaper sponsored the Yomiuri Indépendant Exhibition, an unjuried annual art exhibition which gave rise to avant-garde and contemporary rising artists.

==Digital resources==
In November 1999, the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; released a CD-ROM titled &quot;The Yomiuri Shimbun in the Meiji Era,&quot; which provided searchable archives of news articles and images from the period that have been digitalized from microfilm. This was the first time a newspaper made it possible to search digitalized images of newspaper pictures and articles as they appeared in print.

Subsequent CD-ROMs, &quot;The Taishō Era&quot;, &quot;The pre-war Showa Era I&quot;, and &quot;The pre-war Showa era II&quot; were completed eight years after the project was first conceived. &quot;Postwar Recovery&quot;, the first part of a postwar Shōwa Era series that includes newspaper stories and images until 1960, is on the way.

The system of indexing each newspaper article and image makes the archives easier to search, and the CD-ROMs have been well received by users as a result. This digital resource is available in most major academic libraries in the United States.

<doc id="256599" wikidata="Q150526" url="?curid=256599" title="Santiago Ramón y Cajal">
<text>Santiago Ramón y Cajal (; 1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934) was a Spanish neuroscientist, pathologist, and histologist specializing in neuroanatomy and the central nervous system. He and Camillo Golgi received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906. Ramón y Cajal was the first Spaniard to win a scientific Nobel Prize. His original investigations of the microscopic structure of the brain made him a pioneer of modern neuroscience.

Hundreds of his drawings illustrating the arborization (tree-like growth) of brain cells are still in use, since the mid-20th century, for educational and training purposes.

==Biography==
Santiago Ramón y Cajal was born on 1 May 1852 in the town of Petilla de Aragón, Navarre, Spain. As a child he was transferred many times from one school to another because of behavior that was declared poor, rebellious, and anti-authoritarian. An extreme example of his precociousness and rebelliousness at the age of eleven is his 1863 imprisonment for destroying his neighbor&#x27;s yard gate with a homemade cannon. He was a keen painter, artist, and gymnast, but his father neither appreciated nor encouraged these abilities, even though these artistic talents would contribute to his success later in life. His father apprenticed him to a shoemaker and barber, to &quot;try and give his son much-needed discipline and stability.&quot;

Over the summer of 1868, his father took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Early sketches of bones moved him to pursue medical studies. Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the University of Zaragoza, where his father worked as an anatomy teacher. He graduated in 1873, aged 21, and then served as a medical officer in the Spanish Army. He took part in an expedition to Cuba in 1874–1875, where he contracted malaria and tuberculosis. To aid his recovery, Ramón y Cajal spent time in the spa-town Panticosa in the Pyrenees mountain range.

After returning to Spain, he received his doctorate in medicine in Madrid in 1877. Two years later, he became director of the Anatomical Museum at the University of Zaragoza and married Silveria Fañanás García, with whom he would have seven daughters and five sons. Ramón y Cajal worked at the University of Zaragoza until 1883, when he was awarded the position of anatomy professor of the University of Valencia. His early work at these two universities focused on the pathology of inflammation, the microbiology of cholera, and the structure of epithelial cells and tissues.

In 1887 Ramón y Cajal moved to Barcelona for a professorship. There he first learned about Golgi&#x27;s method, a cell staining method which uses potassium dichromate and silver nitrate to (randomly) stain a few neurons a dark black color, while leaving the surrounding cells transparent. This method, which he improved, was central to his work, allowing him to turn his attention to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), in which neurons are so densely intertwined that standard microscopic inspection would be nearly impossible. During this period he made extensive detailed drawings of neural material, covering many species and most major regions of the brain.

In 1892, he became professor at Madrid. In 1899 he became director of the &quot;Instituto Nacional de Higiene&quot; – translated as &quot;National Institute of Hygiene&quot;, and in 1922 founder of the – translated as &quot;Laboratory of Biological Investigations&quot;, later renamed to , or Cajal Institute.

He died in Madrid on October 17, 1934, at the age of 82, continuing to work even on his deathbed.

==Political and religious views==
In 1877, the 25-year-old Ramón y Cajal joined a Masonic lodge. John Brande Trend wrote in 1965 that Ramón y Cajal &quot;was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion&quot;.
Nonetheless, Ramón y Cajal used the term soul &quot;without any shame&quot;. He was said to later have regretted having left organized religion. Ultimately, he became convinced of a belief in God as a creator, as stated during his first lecture before the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences.

=== Political ideology ===
In addition to being a regenerationist, Ramón y Cajal is considered a Spanish nationalist and centralist, and in this sense he interprets non-Spanish nationalisms, such as Catalan and Basque, describing them as separatist. Despite accepting the Statute of Núria, and, in the academic sphere, that classes can also be given in Catalan language at the university, he does not feel comfortable. And faced with a hypothetical dissolution of the homeland, in 1937, in the midst of Spanish civil war, from the Gaceta de Melilla, he takes as his own the need for an &quot;iron surgeon&quot;, implicitly positioning himself with the national-Catholic rebels against the Spanish Republic: “Whatever the defeatists and pusillanimous augurs may say, the impetus of our race is not easily extinguished... It is necessary to impose the moral unity of the Peninsula, to merge the dissonances and spiritual stridor into a grandiose symphony. But for this we need the iron surgeon that Costa spoke of”

==Discoveries and theories==

Ramón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy. Excited by the discoveries of Frederick C. Kenyon, he explored the insect visual nervous system with his colleague Domingo Sánchez y Sánchez. He was stunned by the variety of neuron types. He discovered the axonal growth cone, and demonstrated experimentally that the relationship between nerve cells was not &quot;continuous&quot;, or a single system as per then extant reticular theory, but rather &quot;contiguous&quot;; there were gaps between neurons. This provided definitive evidence for what Heinrich Waldeyer would name &quot;neuron theory&quot;, now widely considered the foundation of modern neuroscience. He is also considered by some to be the first &quot;neuroscientist&quot; since in 1894 he stated to the Royal Society of London: &quot;The ability of neurons to grow in an adult and their power to create new connections can explain learning.&quot; This statement is considered to be the origin of the synaptic theory of memory.

He was an advocate of the existence of dendritic spines, although he did not recognize them as the site of contact from presynaptic cells. He was a proponent of polarization of nerve cell function and his student, Rafael Lorente de Nó, would continue this study of input-output systems into cable theory and some of the earliest circuit analysis of neural structures.

By producing depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC). This cell is found interleaved among neurons embedded within the smooth muscles lining the gut, serving as the generator and pacemaker of the slow waves of contraction which move material along the gastrointestinal tract, mediating neurotransmission from motor neurons to smooth muscle cells.

In his 1894 Croonian Lecture, Ramón y Cajal suggested (in an extended metaphor) that cortical pyramidal cells may become more elaborate with time, as a tree grows and extends its branches.

He studied some psychological phenomena, such as hypnotic suggestion to alleviate pain, which he used to help his wife during labor. A book he had written on these topics was lost during the Spanish Civil War.

During his studies on the optic chiasma, Cajal developed a visual map-based theory offering an evolutionary explanation for the decussation of nerve fibres and the chiasm of the optic tract.

==Distinctions==

Ramón y Cajal received many prizes, distinctions, and societal memberships during his scientific career, including honorary doctorates in medicine from Cambridge University and Würzburg University and an honorary doctorate in philosophy from Clark University. The most famous distinction he was awarded was the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906, together with the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi &quot;in recognition of their work on the structure of the nervous system&quot;. This caused some controversy because Golgi, a staunch supporter of reticular theory, disagreed with Ramón y Cajal in his view of the neuron doctrine. Before Ramón y Cajal&#x27;s work, Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen had established the contiguous nature of nerve cells in his study of certain marine life, which Ramón y Cajal failed to cite. Ramón y Cajal was an International Member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

==In society and culture==

In 1906 Joaquin Sorolla y Bastida painted Cajal&#x27;s official portrait celebrating his Nobel Prize win.

Cajal posed for a statue that was created by the sculptor Mariano Benlliure and was installed in 1924 in the Paraninfo building at the School of Medicine of the University of Zaragoza.

In 1931 a monument was unveiled in Madrid, Spain. This full-body statue stands 3 meters (around 10 ft) high on a narrow pedestal and was created by Lorenzo Domínguez, a Chilean medical student.

1982 a TV mini series was created in Spain titled &quot;Ramón y Cajal: Historia de una voluntad&quot;.

In 2003, the first major exhibition of Cajal&#x27;s scientific drawings opened in Madrid, Spain. The exhibition featured hundreds of restored original drawings, micrographic slides, and personal photographs created by Cajal. The accompanying catalog titled &quot;Santiago Ramon y Cajal (1852–2003) Ciencia y Arte&quot; features numerous high quality reproductions of Cajal&#x27;s drawings and photo essays on the restoration process. Exhibition curators and contributing authors to the catalog include: Santiago Ramón y Cajal Junquera, Miguel Ángel Freire Mallo, Paloma Esteban Leal, Pablo García, Virginia G. Marin, Ma Cruz Osuna, Isabel Argerich Fernández, Paloma Calle, Marta C. Lopera, Ricardo Martínez, Pilar Sedano Espín, Eugenia Gimeno Pascual, Sonia Tortajada, and Juan Antonio Sáez Dégano.

In 2005 the asteroid 117413 Ramonycajal was named after him by Juan Lacruz.

In 2007, sculptures of Severo Ochoa and Santiago Ramón y Cajal created by Víctor Ochoa were unveiled at the Spanish National Research Council central headquarters in Madrid, Spain.

Santiago Ramón y Cajal Museum, Ayerbe, Huesca, Spain opened in 2013 and is located in Cajal&#x27;s childhood home, where he lived with his family for ten years.

In 2014, the National Institutes of Health initiated an ongoing exhibition of original Ramón y Cajal drawings in the John Porter Neuroscience Research Center, located in the NIH central campus in Bethesda, MD, USA. The exhibition concept was spearheaded by NINDS Senior Researcher Jeffery Diamond and NINDS science writer Christopher Thomas and was made possible through close collaboration with the Instituto Cajal, Madrid, Spain. The exhibition also includes contemporary artwork curated by Jeff Diamond, which was created by artists Rebecca Kamen and Dawn Hunter. Inspired by Cajal&#x27;s original drawings, Kamen&#x27;s and Hunter&#x27;s artworks are thematically representative of Cajal&#x27;s aesthetic and are on permanent display for the public at the John Porter Neuroscience Research Center. Through the award of a 2017–2018 Fulbright España Senior Research Fellowship to the Instituto Cajal, Madrid, Spain, Hunter continued to develop her creative project about Cajal by referencing original source material.

A selection of Cajal&#x27;s scientific drawings, personal photos, oil paintings, and pastel drawings were curated into the 14th Istanbul Biennial, &quot;Saltwater&quot;, that was held in Istanbul, Turkey from September 5 – November 1, 2015.

The exhibition &quot;Fisiología de los Sueños. Cajal, Tanguy, Lorca, Dalí...&quot; opened on October 5, 2015, and ended on January 16, 2016, at the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain. Cajal&#x27;s work was the centerpiece topic of the exhibition and the show explored the influence of histological drawings on Surrealism.

From January 31 – May 29, 2016, Cajal&#x27;s work was featured in the inaugural exhibition for the re-opening of University of California&#x27;s Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive &quot;Architecture of Life&quot;. The catalog for the exhibition featured Cajal&#x27;s drawing of the Purkinje Cell on the front cover.

The National Institutes of Health, USA, and the Instituto Cajal, Spain, held collaborative symposiums honoring Cajal on October 28, 2015, and May 24, 2017. The first symposium held at the NIH in 2015 was titled &quot;Bridging the Legacy of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a symposium honoring the father of modern neuroscience&quot;.  Keynote speaker Dr. Rafael Yuste was honored at a reception held at the Spanish Ambassador&#x27;s, Ramón Gil-Casares, home.  The second symposium titled, &quot;New Opportunities for NIH-CSIC Collaboration&quot;, was held at the Instituto Cajal in 2017.  Dawn Hunter&#x27;s &quot;Cajal Inventory&quot; art project was exhibited at the symposium for the general public in the institute&#x27;s library. The &quot;Cajal Inventory&quot; consists of forty-five 11” x 14” drawings in which Hunter recreated in fine detail Cajal&#x27;s scientific drawings from primary source, and surreal portrait drawings of Cajal inspired by his photography.

Every year since 2001, more than two hundred postdoctoral scholarships are awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Science to middle career scholars from different fields of knowledge. They are called &quot;Ayudas a contratos Ramón y Cajal&quot; to honor his memory.

An exhibition called &quot;The Beautiful Brain: The Drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal&quot; travelled through North America, beginning 2017 in the US at the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The exhibition traveled to the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Grey Art Gallery, New York University, New York City, New York, USA, MIT Museum, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, and ended in April 2019 at the Ackland Art Museum in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. &quot;The Beautiful Brain&quot; book, published by Abrams, New York, accompanied the exhibition.

During 2019, the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain opened an exhibition about Cajal titled &quot;Santiago Ramón y Cajal. 150 years at the University of Zaragoza.&quot; The exhibition had an accompanying catalog that featured the same title. The exhibition opened October 2019 and closed at the end of December 2019.

A short documentary by REDES is available on YouTube.

From November 19, 2020, to December 5, 2021, the National Museum of Natural Sciences, Madrid, Spain, hosted an exhibition featuring Cajal&#x27;s scientific drawings, photographs, scientific equipment and personal objects from the Legado Cajal, Instituto Cajal, Madrid, Spain.

In 2020, over 75 volunteers collaborated as part of The Cajal Embroidery Project across 6 countries to create 81 intricate, exquisite hand-stitched panels of Ramón y Cajal&#x27;s images, which were then curated and displayed by Edinburgh Neuroscience at the virtual FENS 2020 Forum, and showcased by &quot;The Lancet Neurology&quot; in their front covers in 2021.

In 2017, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) recognised Cajal&#x27;s Legacy (which had been kept in a museum from 1945 to 1989) as a World Heritage treasure. Recognising that this cultural treasure deserves a dedicated museum, showcasing not only Cajal&#x27;s but also his disciples’ legacies, there has been a call for a dedicated museum to commemorate and celebrate Ramón y Cajal&#x27;s discoveries and impact on neuroscience.

Project Encephalon organised Cajal Week to celebrate his 169th birth anniversary from 1 May to 7 May 2021.

&quot;The Brain In Search Of Itself&quot;, an English language biography, was published in 2022.

<doc id="256603" wikidata="Q1412941" url="?curid=256603" title="Lapua Movement">
<text>The Lapua Movement (, ) was a radical Finnish nationalist, fascist, pro-German and anti-communist political movement founded in and named after the town of Lapua. Led by Vihtori Kosola, it turned towards far-right politics after its founding and was banned after a failed coup d&#x27;etat attempt in 1932. The movement&#x27;s anti-communist activities continued in the parliamentarian Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement.

== Background ==
At the 6th World Congress of the Communist International Joseph Stalin ordered all communist parties around the world to accelerate class struggle. The order led to a higher level of communist activity in Finland in 1929 like the so-called &quot;Red Day&quot; of August 1st when communists organized countrywide protests. A general strike was also declared in November, although it failed to garner support and only 5–10% of workers participated in it. 

The movement originated in November 1929, after Finnish communist youth paraded in the conservative and religious town of Lapua enraged pro-White Guard locals, who subsequently attacked the performers physically. The momentum from this event was the catalyst for the formation of the Lapua Movement. It was initially dominated by anti-communist nationalists, emphasizing the legacy of the nationalist activism, the White Guards and the Civil War in Finland. The movement saw itself as the defender of what was won in the Civil War, supporting Lutheranism, Finnish nationalism, and anti-communism.

Many politicians and high-ranking military officers were initially sympathetic to the Lapua Movement, as anti-communism was the norm in the educated classes after the Civil War. However, excessive use of violence made the movement less popular within a few months.

During the Civil War, Ostrobothnia had been one of the most important strongholds of the White army, and anti-communist sentiments remained extremely strong. Late in November 1929, the Young Communist League of Finland arranged meetings and protests in Ostrobothnian Lapua. As the nationalists saw it, the communists had &quot;mocked God, the Lutheran Church, the &#x27;bourgeois&#x27; fatherland, the Finnish army and General Mannerheim&quot;. This infuriated many of the townspeople, who put a violent end to the meetings. Anti-communist violence was hailed as justified and praiseworthy. On 1 December an anti-communist meeting was held, attracting more than 1,000 people demanding an end to all communist activities. The movement quickly spread around the country, and in some provinces people other than communists were targeted as well, for example the group &quot;Patriotic Citizens of Viitasaari&quot; wanted to purge Jews and Freemasons from the country.

== Activities ==

After the events in Lapua, local politicians Kustaa Tiitu and Artturi Leinonen called a &quot;national assembly&quot; to the town to discuss the growing communist agitation. The assembly was attended by some two thousand people from across the country, and it drew up a list of demands, which was delivered to the government. The demands were to remove communists from Parliament and the military, to forbid speech that &quot;desecrated the foundations of the Finnish people&#x27;s sense of morality and justice&quot; and to stop the Communist Party, which had already been banned, from operating in Finland. Other assemblies were quickly organized in different parts of the country, and they all sent similar demands with some also adding that they were prepared to save the country &quot;by other means&quot;, as well, should the government fail to act.

The parliament quickly accepted amendmends to the Associations Act, but amendments to the Freedom of the Press Act failed to gather sufficient support. Radicals among the Movement answered by attacking the communist paper &quot;Työn Ääni&quot; directly. The night of March 28th 1930 thirteen men broke into the paper&#x27;s facilities and destroyed their presses. On April 4th seventy-two men publicly declared themselves responsible for the attack, but only the actual perpetrators and the main organizer, Yrjö Nikula, were charged. The trial, which was held in Vaasa two months later, turned into a riot. After the judge called an intermission and people were leaving the courtroom, &quot;Työn Ääni&quot; employee and witness in the case, Eino Nieminen, was surrounded by supporters of the Movement, who accused him of being a &quot;red officer&quot;. Nieminen was dragged to the street and beaten badly along with three other communists. Asser Salo, &quot;Työn Ääni&quot; attorney, was abducted in a car to Lapua.

The Movement used violence to apply pressure to the government and parliament to stop communist activity in Finland. Meetings held by leftist and labour groups were also interrupted, often violently. A common tactic was &quot;muilutus&quot; or &quot;&quot;kyyditys&quot;,&quot; which started with kidnapping and beating. After that the subject was thrown into a car and driven to the border with the Soviet Union. Many of the Finns deported by the Lapua Movement were later caught up in Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge and executed; while persecuted in Finland as communists, Stalin accused them of being &quot;Nationalists&quot;.

After the Vaasa riot, witnessing the Kyösti Kallio led government&#x27;s inability to control the situation, the Movement reiterated their demands with regards to communist organizations and papers and declared June 15th as the deadline for fulfilling them. The government was unwilling to use the military or the police to restore order, because it believed them to sympathize with the Movement. Instead President Lauri Relander asked former Prime Minister P. E. Svinhufvud, whom the Finnish right wing greatly respected, to negotiate with the movement. Svinhufvud convinced Kosola and the other leaders that there was a legal way to achieve their goals and aided them in formulating a plan to remove communists through parliamentary means.

On July 1st the government brought the so-called Communist Laws to a vote and resigned the following day. Svinhufvud became the new prime minister as the Lapua Movement had wished, but he refused to make Vihtori Kosola a member of cabinet or to arrest communist members of parliament. In response Kosola ordered the abductions of members of parliament Jalmari Rötkö and Eino Pekkala. The Lapua Movement had planned a massive show of force, the &quot;Peasant March&quot;, to be held on July 7th. Kosola was persuaded to release the abductees when Svinhufvud informed him that he would not be there to greet the marchers otherwise. The Peasant March gathered 12,600 men to Helsinki where they marched through the city, held speeches and sermons and were greeted by distinguished politicians and generals. 

Of the Communist Laws, changes to the Freedom of the Press Act were this time accepted by parliament with a simple majority, but the Protection of the Republic Act was considered a constitutional law and thereby required a five sixths majority to pass immediately. Social Democrats were only willing to accept the law for a three year temporary period, which meant that the Act only received a simple majority and had to be voted on by the next parliament. On July 15th the President disbanded the parliament and called for an election.

Failure to pass all the Communist Laws led to a new wave of abductions and beatings by the Lapua Movement over the autumn of 1930. Vihtori Kosola&#x27;s outspoken goal was to let society deteriorate to a state of anarchy, which would make dictatorship a preferable alternative to people. Other more moderate leaders of the Movement however no longer accepted the abductions and, in September, convinced Kosola to stop them. Most notable cases over this period were the abduction of Väinö Hakkila, a Social Democrat vice-chairman of parliament, and that of the municipal politician Onni Happonen, who was killed and confirmed to not actually be a communist. 

Before the election the Lapua Movement was also involved in electoral fraud. The Movement&#x27;s violent reputation was used to intimidate socialist voters to either abstain or to vote for right wing candidates, Social Democratic Party members were harassed on the campaign trail and hustings were interrupted, and guards were organized around polling stations. Voters perceived as communists were also outright removed from electoral rolls.

After the election right wing parties had the majority they needed to pass the remaining Communist Laws. Despite this the most infamous abduction was carried out on 14 October 1930 when the popular ex-president Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg and his wife Ester were kidnapped and taken to Joensuu. After this, general support for the movement collapsed. More moderate people left the movement, and extremists became more influential.

== Failed rebellion ==

In February 1932 a Social Democrat meeting in Mäntsälä was violently interrupted by armed Lapua activists. The event escalated to an attempted coup d&#x27;état known as the Mäntsälä rebellion &quot;(Mäntsälän kapina),&quot; led by the former Chief of Staff of Finland&#x27;s army, General Wallenius. Despite the appeals of Wallenius, the army and the White Guards were largely loyal to the government. Many historians believe the main reason for the failure was poor planning: the event just escalated from actions of the local chapter and the national organization came aboard later. The rebellion ended after President Svinhufvud gave a radio speech to the rebels. After a trial, the Lapua Movement was banned on 21 November 1932 under the Protection of the Republic Act, which Lapua itself had worked to get passed. Wallenius and about 50 other leaders were sentenced to prison.

== Legacy ==

After the Lapua Movement was banned, the Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement was formed shortly thereafter. Like its predecessor, it also was nationalist and anti-communist. It had limited political success and was banned in 1944 on the orders of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the Continuation War.

<text>The motmots or Momotidae are a family of birds in the order Coraciiformes, which also includes the kingfishers, bee-eaters and rollers. All extant motmots are restricted to woodland or forests in the Neotropics, and the largest are in Central America. They have a colourful plumage and a relatively heavy bill. All except the tody motmot have relatively long tails that in some species have a distinctive racket-like tip.

==Behaviour==
Motmots eat small prey such as insects and lizards, and will also take fruit. In Nicaragua and Costa Rica, motmots have been observed feeding on poison dart frogs.

Like most of the Coraciiformes, motmots nest in tunnels in banks, laying about four white eggs. Some species form large colonies of up to 40 paired individuals. The eggs hatch after about 20 days, and the young leave the nest after another 30 days. Both parents care for the young.

Motmots often move their tails back and forth in a wag-display that commonly draws attention to an otherwise hidden bird. Research indicates that motmots perform the wag-display when they detect predators (based on studies on turquoise-browed motmot) and that the display is likely to communicate that the motmot is aware of the predator and is prepared to escape. This form of interspecific pursuit-deterrent signal provides a benefit to both the motmot and the predator: the display prevents the motmot from wasting time and energy fleeing, and the predator avoids a costly pursuit that is unlikely to result in capture.

The largest concentration of motmots reside in Honduras and Guatemala, with a total of 7 subspecies. It is also the national bird of Nicaragua and El Salvador.

There is also evidence that the male tail, which is slightly larger than the female tail, functions as a sexual signal in the turquoise-browed motmot.

In several species of motmots, the barbs near the ends of the two longest (central) tail feathers are weak and fall off due to abrasion with substrates, or fall off during preening, leaving a length of bare shaft, thus creating the racket shape of the tail. It was, however, wrongly believed in the past that the motmot shaped its tail by plucking part of the feather web to leave the racket. This was based on inaccurate reports made by Charles William Beebe. It has since been shown that these barbs are weakly attached and fall off due to abrasion with substrates and during routine preening. There are, however, also several species where the tail is &quot;normal&quot;, these being the tody motmot, blue-throated motmot, rufous-capped motmot, and the Amazonian populations of the rufous and broad-billed motmots.

== Taxonomy ==

A fossil genus of Oligocene coraciiform from Switzerland has been described as &quot;Protornis&quot;; it might be a primitive motmot or a more basal lineage. A partial momotid humerus found in early Hemphilian (Late Miocene, c. 8 mya) deposits in Alachua County, USA has not been named; it might belong to an extant genus.

The phylogenetic relationship between the six families that make up the order Coraciiformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

<text>Cardinalidae (sometimes referred to as the &quot;cardinal-grosbeaks&quot; or simply the &quot;cardinals&quot;) is a family of New World-endemic passerine birds that consists of cardinals, grosbeaks, and buntings. It also includes several other genera such as the tanager-like &quot;Piranga&quot; and the warbler-like &quot;Granatellus&quot;. Membership of this family is not easily defined by a single or even a set of physical characteristics, but instead by molecular work. Among songbirds, they range from average-sized to relatively large, and have stout features, some species with large, heavy bills. 

Members of this group are beloved for their brilliant red, yellow, or blue plumages seen in many of the breeding males in this family. Most species are monogamous breeders that nest in open-cup nests, with parents taking turns incubating the nest and taking care of their young. Most are arboreal species, although the dickcissel is a ground-dwelling prairie bird. 

In terms of conservation, most members of this family are considered least concern by the IUCN Red List, though a few birds, such as the Carrizal seedeater, are considered to be endangered.

==Field characteristics==
The grosbeaks, seedeaters, and cardinals have large bills, while &quot;Granatellus&quot; and buntings have small bills. The cardinalid tanagers have stout, near pointed bills, with some species of &quot;Piranga&quot; having serrations along the edge of their upper bills. This bill shape is not always an indicator of relationships, as the various species of blue cardinalid species, like the blue grosbeak and &quot;Cyanoloxia&quot; grosbeaks are related to the buntings. Similarly, the cardinalid tanagers are closer to the cardinals and masked grosbeaks (see more in the systematics section). The head is medium to large in size, with a medium neck length. The body of cardinalids ranges from small to medium with lengths of 4.5 to 11 in (11 to 28 cm). Legs are also short to medium in length. The wings are medium and pointed. Cardinalids have nine visible primary feathers with the tenth primary feather being short in comparison. 

The plumages in cardinalids are sexually dichromatic as many males of various species display bright reds, oranges, blues or blacks. In most temperate species, males will undergo molting between seasons, so that non-breeding males will somewhat resemble the females of their species. These species, such as the indigo bunting, will exhibit a complex molt cycle going through four different stages of plumage coverage within their first year of life. From spring to summer, birds start with juvenile plumage to supplemental plumage, then changing to a first basic (nonbreeding) plumage from fall to winter, and finally reaching the first alternate (breeding) plumage. Adults will typically have the basic two molt cycle changing to basic or partial in the late summer or fall, and then back to alternate again in the spring. Males of tropical species will have the same coloration year-round. Females of all species are either drabber in coloration by comparison, often having a lighter coloration of the males. The molting pattern in most cardinalids exhibits delayed plumage maturation, causing the first-year male birds to often be in non-breeding plumage or at an intermediate stage. The molting pattern in cardinalids is divided into two types. A preformative molt is a partial molt where only the body feathers get replaced, but not the wing and tail feathers, which is seen in a lot of temperate and neotropical species. The second type is an eccentric preformative molt when only the outer primary and inner secondaries are replaced. This molt is seen in some species of &quot;Cyanoloxia&quot; and &quot;Passerina&quot;.

==Systematics==
Traditionally, members of this group were classified as a tribe of the finch family Fringillidae (Cardinalini), characterized by heavy, conical, seed-crushing bills. The group consisted of the genera &quot;Pheucticus&quot;, &quot;Parkerthraustes&quot;, &quot;Saltator&quot;, &quot;Spiza&quot;, &quot;Cyanocompsa&quot;, &quot;Cyanoloxia&quot;, &quot;Porphyrospiza&quot;, &quot;Passerina&quot;, &quot;Caryothraustes&quot;, &quot;Periporphyrus&quot;, and &quot;Cardinalis&quot;. The issue that taxonomists had faced was that there were no unifying morphological traits that were in agreement for various studies. In 2007, a mitochondrial DNA study by Klicka, Burns and Spellman sampling all of the aforementioned genera and 34 of the total 42 species, found that the genera &quot;Parkerthraustes&quot;, &quot;Saltator&quot;, and &quot;Porphyrospiza&quot; were not members of the cardinal-lineage, but instead are found throughout in the tanager-lineage (Thraupidae). The genera classified as thraupids at the time, &quot;Piranga&quot;, &quot;Habia&quot;, &quot;Chlorothraupis&quot;, and &quot;Amaurospiza&quot;, are found to be part of cardinalid radiation. In addition the genus &quot;Granatellus&quot;, originally classified as a parulid warbler, are also found to be part of Cardinalidae. The study found that with this new relationship Cardinalidae can be classified into six subgroups, which have been supported by subsequent studies. The six subclades consists of the &quot;Pheucticus&quot; lineage, the &quot;Granatellus&quot; lineage, the “blue” lineage (&quot;Spiza&quot;, &quot;Cyanoloxia&quot;, &quot;Amaurospiza&quot;, &quot;Cyanocompsa&quot;, and &quot;Passerina&quot;), the &quot;Habia&quot; lineage (&quot;Habia&quot; and &quot;Chlorothraupis&quot;), the “masked” lineage (&quot;Caryothraustes&quot;, &quot;Periporphyrus&quot;, and &quot;Cardinalis&quot;), and the &quot;Piranga&quot; lineage (&quot;Piranga&quot; and &quot;Driophlox&quot;). These subclades and membership of these genera have been widely supported in subsequent studies. A 2021 paper by Guallar et al. based on the preformative molting pattern of cardinalids suggested the ancestor of this group was a forest-dwelling bird that dispersed into open habitats on numerous occasions.

The cardinalids are part of a larger grouping of American endemic songbirds, Emberizoidea, which also includes the aforementioned thraupids and parulids, as well as icterids (New World blackbirds), passerellids (New World sparrows), and several families that contain one or a couple of genera. Several studies have placed cardinalids as either the sister group to Thraupidae, Mitrospingidae (a small family whose genera were formerly classified as thraupids), or the sister to a clade containing thraupids and mitrospingids. At least one study suggested that cardinalids could treated as a subfamily of Thraupidae.

===Phylogeny===
The genus level cladogram of the Cardinalidae shown below is based on molecular phylogenetic study published in 2024 that analysed DNA sequences flanking ultraconserved elements (UCEs). The number of species in each genus is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

===Species list===
The following 53 species and 14 genera are recognized by the IOC as of July 2024:
==Natural history==
===Habitat, distribution and migration===
The cardinalids can be found from Canada to northern Argentina and Uruguay, with Central America having the most concentrated amount of species. Species are found year-around in the Central United States and the Eastern United States down to the neotropics. Cardinalids found in the West Indies are non-breeding migrants and those in the Western United States and Canada are breeding migrants. The western tanager is the northernmost species in the family, with their breeding ranges occurring in the southern portions of the Northwest Territories. The northern cardinal has been introduced in Hawaii and Bermuda. They occupy a variety of habitats from forests to grassland and arid scrubland. Most North American cardinalid species migrate south for the winter, whether further south in the continent or extending into the neotropics, except the northern cardinal and pyrrhuloxia which stay year-round. The neotropical species are residential year-round in their range.

===Feeding ecology===

Cardinals, the dickcissel, seedeaters, buntings, and grosbeaks have the thicker, seed-crushing bills that enabled them to feed heavily on fruits and seeds outside of the breeding season (especially in the winter for northern species like the aforementioned dickcissel and northern cardinal). Once their breeding season begins, members of this group will supplement themselves with invertebrate prey, vital when raising their young and refueling their energetic costs of reproduction and other daily activities. The genera &quot;Chlorothraupis&quot;, &quot;Habia&quot;, &quot;Piranga&quot;, and &quot;Granatellus&quot; have slightly longer and less deep bills, which their diet mostly consists of insects, fruit, nectar and sap, less so on seeds. Cardinalids typically forage alone low level or on the ground, though some like &quot;Piranga&quot; and grosbeaks will forage high in the tree canopy. Many will come to birdfeeders especially during the winter.

===Breeding and reproduction===

Nearly all cardinalids are monogamous breeders and are highly territorial. Despite being monogamous this is only during the breeding season, and each year the birds might partner up with a different bird. The only exception is the dickcissel which is a polygynous species which nest in dense grasses and sedges. Other non-monogamous species include the lazuli and painted buntings which perform extra-copulation with multiple partners. The family is known for their intense brilliant songs. In some species like the lazuli bunting and indigo bunting the bird learn singing by match-based, meaning that first year breeding males will learn by copying the songs of nearby males, as opposed of learning it while they are in the nest. Even more unusual is the females of a few species, such as the scarlet tanager, northern cardinal, pyrrhuloxia, and black-headed grosbeak, which sing as well. In temperate species the breeding season occurs annually while in tropical species it is year-around. The breeding seasons are in sync with the abundance of insects. Most species build open-cup nests made of grasses and twigs depending on the species. These nests would be in the trees, often high up in the crown. The nest building is done by both partners or by the female alone. The male and female take turns incubating the nest, often the male would feed the female. In a clutch on average there are 1 to 6 six eggs, with tropical species laying the fewest. Cardinalids produce one to three broods per season. As with other passerines, the young are born altricial and fledged between one and two weeks.

==Conservation==

As of 2021, the IUCN Red List has nearly 82 percent of cardinalids to be least concern. However, there are a handful of species that are of conservation concern. The rose-bellied bunting is an endemic near-threatened species as they are found in a small area of Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico; the black-cheeked ant-tanager is another endemic species found in Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica and the carrizal seedeater a critically endangered species found in the spiny bamboo thickets in the understory of deciduous forest in a remote southeastern corner of Venezuela. All of these species are threatened with habitat loss and the confinement within their much smaller range. The IUCN has not yet reevaluate the other species of seedeaters in the genus &quot;Amaurospiza&quot;.

Despite the vast majority of species being classified as least concern, there has been a growing concern in how the ongoing climate crisis will affect the distribution and migration of many species across the globe. One study led by Dr. Brooke L. Bateman published in July 2020 focused on the risk North American birds will face from climate change and the measures needed to protect them. The first study assessed 604 species from the United States found that if the planet warmed by 3.0 degrees Celsius many species, especially arctic birds, waterbirds, and boreal and western forest birds, will be highly vulnerable to climate change and future conservation efforts will need to be in place. Among the species sampled, the North American species of &quot;Piranga&quot; and &quot;Pheucticus&quot; are found to be most climate vulnerable of the cardinalids. These species will either lose some substantial amount of their range or they will migrate up north to escape the sudden change in their habitat.

A possible extinct species is the controversial Townsend&#x27;s bunting, a supposed enigmatic species related to the dickcissel. The Townsend&#x27;s bunting is only known from a single type specimen collected from Chester County, Pennsylvania by John Kirk Townsend and described by John James Audubon in 1834. The specimen is housed in the National Museum of Natural History. Genetic work has not been done on this bird, but observation of the plumage has been done. The controversy stems from the uncertainty from authors whether the bird is an extinct species, a rare color-variant of the dickcissel, or a hybrid female dickcissel and male blue grosbeak. If the bird is indeed simply a dickcissel it lacks any of the known field characteristics seen in the species in all life stages and sexes.

<text>Geraldine Estelle Halliwell-Horner (&quot;née&quot; Halliwell; born 6 August 1972) is an English singer, songwriter, television personality, author, and actress. She rose to fame in the mid 1990s as a member of the pop group the Spice Girls, in which she was nicknamed Ginger Spice. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, the Spice Girls are the best-selling female group of all time. Their slogan &quot;girl power&quot; was most closely associated with Halliwell and her Union Jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards also became an enduring symbol. Halliwell left the Spice Girls in 1998, citing exhaustion and creative differences, but rejoined when they reunited for a greatest hits album (2007) and two concert tours: the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) and Spice World (2019).

After leaving the Spice Girls, Halliwell pursued a career as a solo artist, signing a recording contract with EMI. She released her debut solo studio album, &quot;Schizophonic&quot; (1999), which produced the UK number-one singles &quot;Mi Chico Latino&quot;, &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; and &quot;Bag It Up&quot;; the lead single, &quot;Look at Me&quot;, reached number two. Her second studio album, &quot;Scream If You Wanna Go Faster&quot; (2001), was preceded by the lead single, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;, which reached number one in the UK and earned her a Brit Award nomination. Her third studio album, &quot;Passion&quot; (2005), produced the UK top five single &quot;Ride It&quot;. In 2013, Halliwell returned to the music industry in Australia with the release of her first solo single in eight years, &quot;Half of Me&quot;.

Halliwell has served as a judge on television talent shows, including &quot;&quot; (2002), &quot;The X Factor UK,&quot; (2010, 2012), and &quot;Australia&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2013). She has appeared in films, including &quot;Spice World&quot; (1997), &quot;&quot; (2009), and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; (2023). As an author, Halliwell has released two autobiographies: &quot;If Only&quot; (1999) and &quot;Just for the Record&quot; (2002); the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Ugenia Lavender&quot; (2008), and the young adult novel &quot;Rosie Frost and the Falcon Queen&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Geraldine Estelle Halliwell was born on 6 August 1972 at Watford General Hospital in Watford, Hertfordshire, the daughter of Ana María (née Hidalgo) and Laurence Francis Halliwell (1922–1993). Her mother is a Spaniard, hailing from Huesca, while her father was of Swedish, Finnish, English and a &quot;bit of French&quot; descent. Halliwell&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a Swedish-speaking Finn Mathias Karlson Sjövik, born in Korsnäs, Finland, who emigrated to Sweden. Halliwell grew up on a council estate in North Watford. She was educated at Watford Grammar School for Girls and Camden School for Girls. Before starting her music career, Halliwell had worked as a nightclub dancer in Majorca, a presenter on the Turkish version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, and a glamour model. At the age of 19, she appeared as a Page 3 girl in &quot;The Sun&quot;. Following her rise to fame, nude photos of Halliwell were republished in a number of magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; in 1998.

==Career==

===1994–1998: Spice Girls===
In 1994, Halliwell, along with Melanie C, Mel B and Victoria Beckham, responded to an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot; magazine seeking members for a new all-girl pop group. Around 400 women responded and auditioned. After a couple of line-up changes, Halliwell, Melanie C, Mel B and Beckham became the members of the group called &quot;Touch&quot;, and were later joined by Emma Bunton.

In March 1995, the group broke with their original management, Heart Management. In the months that followed, they teamed up with music manager Simon Fuller, signed a deal with Virgin Records, and changed the group name to Spice Girls. In 1996, the group released their debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;, which became a worldwide commercial success. The album peaked at number one in more than 17 countries and was certified multi-platinum in 27 countries. The group&#x27;s massive and sudden popularity was compared to Beatlemania. The album sold 30 million copies worldwide, became the biggest-selling album in music history by a girl group, and is one of the most successful albums of all time. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Wannabe&quot;, reached number one in 37 countries and all of the subsequent singles from the album – &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; and &quot;Mama&quot; – also peaked at number one in United Kingdom.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Wannabe&quot;, each member of the group received a nickname from &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine; the use of these nicknames later became widespread. Because of her red hair, Halliwell was named &quot;Ginger Spice&quot;. Although regularly uttered by all five Spice Girls, the phrase &quot;girl power&quot; was most closely associated with Halliwell and was often accompanied with a V sign. In a Christmas 1996 interview with &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine, Halliwell spoke of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as being an inspiration for their girl power ideology. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, she said, &quot;For me, if you look it up, it means equalisation between the sexes. It means everybody, whether you&#x27;re a man, woman or something in between. Forget about labels, it&#x27;s about embracing everyone&#x27;s individuality and giving them the opportunity and gender equality and pushing that forward.&quot;

In 1997, the group released their second album, &quot;Spiceworld&quot;. The album&#x27;s first two singles &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and &quot;Too Much&quot; reached number one in the UK, marking seven consecutive number one singles, an all-time record for a musical group. The album was a global best seller, selling 20 million copies worldwide. The group also starred in their own film, &quot;Spiceworld: The Movie&quot;, which grossed $100 million worldwide. The third single from &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot;, peaked at two, breaking the group&#x27;s sequence of number ones.

On 31 May 1998, Halliwell announced through her solicitor that she had left the Spice Girls due to depression and differences between the group. Her action aroused controversy as her former group was due to embark on a North American tour, which they eventually completed without her. In the months that followed, Halliwell was featured on two more Spice Girls releases that were scheduled prior to her departure. On 1 June 1998, Halliwell alongside the other Spice Girls were featured in the song and video for &quot;(How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World&quot;, the official theme of the England national football team for the 1998 World Cup. In July 1998, the Spice Girls released &quot;Viva Forever&quot; as the final single from &quot;Spiceworld.&quot; The animated music video for the song still features Halliwell&#x27;s likeness, as it was in production months prior to her departure. The group is among the best-selling girl groups of all time, selling over 75 million albums.

=== 1999–2003: &quot;Schizophonic&quot; and &quot;Scream If You Wanna Go Faster&quot; ===

In 1999, one year after leaving the group, Halliwell launched her solo career and released her debut album &quot;Schizophonic&quot;, with the lead single &quot;Look at Me&quot;, produced by Absolute and Phil Bucknall. &quot;Look at Me&quot; was followed by further number ones at the UK Singles Chart, &quot;Mi Chico Latino&quot;, &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; and &quot;Bag It Up&quot;. The album itself reached a peak at number four in the United Kingdom and sold 600,000 copies there, making it double platinum. The album was preceded by a 90-minute documentary titled &quot;Geri,&quot; released in May 1999 for the British television channel Channel 4 by Molly Dineen. The documentary was a ratings success with 4.5 million viewers—almost one-fifth of available viewers—and Channel 4 aired it again one month later. Halliwell was nominated at the BRIT Awards ceremony in 2000 for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best Pop Act; she performed &quot;Bag It Up&quot; during the show. In the United States, &quot;Schizophonic&quot; peaked at number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold for shipments of over 500,000 copies. The album has sold over two million copies worldwide.

In October 1999, Halliwell released the autobiography &quot;If Only&quot;, in which she described her life as a Spice Girl. By the following year, the book had sold over 200,000 copies. Halliwell donated the advance she received for the book to a London-based breast cancer care organization. 

In 2001, Halliwell released her second album, &quot;Scream If You Wanna Go Faster.&quot; The album peaked at number five in the United Kingdom and was certified gold. Her cover version of the Weather Girls&#x27; 1983 hit, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; was released as the lead single from the album and was also included on the &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; film soundtrack. &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; became a major hit worldwide, peaking at number one in the United Kingdom and within the top 10 in over 27 countries, becoming Halliwell&#x27;s biggest hit to date. The song won her the International Song of the Year award at the 2002 NRJ Music Awards. Follow-up singles &quot;Scream If You Wanna Go Faster&quot; and &quot;Calling&quot; reached number eight and number seven in the United Kingdom, respectively. Halliwell also released a French version of &quot;Calling&quot; titled &quot;Au Nom de L&#x27;amour&quot;. In 2001, Halliwell released the yoga DVD &quot;Geri Yoga&quot; with Katy Appleton; this was followed by &quot;Geri Body Yoga&quot; the following year. 

In January 2002, Halliwell was once again nominated at the BRIT Awards, this time for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Single for &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;. In September 2002, she released her second autobiography, &quot;Just for the Record&quot;. In late 2002, Halliwell was featured alongside Pete Waterman and Louis Walsh as a judge on the television series &quot;&quot;, which created Girls Aloud. She was also featured as a guest reporter on the television program &quot;Extra&quot; in the US. In 2003, she made a guest appearance on the television series &quot;Sex and the City.&quot;

===2004–2012: &quot;Passion&quot;, &quot;Ugenia Lavender&quot;, and Spice Girls reunion===

In late 2004, Halliwell made a return to music with the single &quot;Ride It&quot;, which reached number four in the United Kingdom and number one on the dance charts. Halliwell planned her first solo tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland, but low ticket sales led to the cancellation of the tour. That year, Halliwell appeared in the 2004 film &quot;Fat Slags&quot;, based on characters from &quot;Viz&quot; magazine. She also appeared on Channel Five as one of the hosts of the Party in the Park event for the Prince&#x27;s Trust and was the presenter and main performer of the &quot;Tickled Pink Girls&#x27; night in Live!&quot; event. The single &quot;Desire&quot; was released on 30 May 2005, reaching number 22 in the UK Singles Chart and number one on the UK Dance Charts. Released shortly after, the source album, &quot;Passion&quot;, peaked at number 41 in the British charts. The album was preceded by the promotional documentary &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Geri&quot;.

On 12 April 2007, it was announced that Halliwell had signed a six-book deal with Macmillan Children&#x27;s Books. The series of children&#x27;s novels, titled &quot;Ugenia Lavender&quot;, follow the adventures of nine-year-old Ugenia, a character based on Halliwell, alongside her friends Bronte, Rudy and Trevor. The character Princess Posh Vattoria, a caricature of Halliwell&#x27;s bandmate Victoria Beckham, was featured in early drafts, but has not appeared in the book series. Other characters are said by Halliwell to be loosely based on Gordon Ramsay, George Michael, Marilyn Monroe, Vincent van Gogh, Wayne Rooney and the character Justin Suarez from the TV series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;. According to the official site, the book sold more than 250,000 copies in its first 5 months, making Halliwell 2008&#x27;s most successful female celebrity children&#x27;s author.

On 29 June 2007, the Spice Girls regrouped and announced plans for a reunion tour, from which they were said to have earned £10 million each (about US$20 million). The group toured as a quintet and released their first compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. This album was released in early November 2007 and the tour began on 2 December 2007. On 31 December 2007, the Spice Girls documentary &quot;Spice Girls: Giving You Everything&quot; was released. In addition to their sell-out tour, the Spice Girls appeared in Tesco advertisements for which they were paid £1 million each.

In 2009, Halliwell appeared in the film &quot;&quot; and on the BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; on 7 May 2009.

In April 2010, Halliwell posted a message on her website, saying she was back in the studio. On 31 July 2011, Halliwell confirmed she had been working on her fourth album and remarked that it was &quot;pretty much finished.&quot; In February 2012, Halliwell announced that her fourth album was being mastered.

=== 2012–2019: Return to music and second Spice Girls reunion ===

In November 2016, 13 new songs by Halliwell which were reportedly recorded for an album titled &quot;Man on the Mountain&quot; were leaked onto the internet.

In July 2016, Halliwell, Mel B and Bunton released a video celebrating the 20th anniversary of Spice Girls&#x27; debut single &quot;Wannabe&quot; and teased news from them as a three-piece; Beckham and Melanie C opted not to take part in a reunion project, with Mel B saying that both members gave the three-piece their blessing to continue with the project. However, following Halliwell&#x27;s announcement of her pregnancy, the project was cancelled. That year, Halliwell appeared on episode three of the 2016 series of &quot;Sport Relief Bake Off&quot;.

It has grossed $122 million worldwide against its $60 million budget.

In October 2022, Halliwell announced a new book deal with the UK branch of Scholastic. The first book announced is a young adult novel titled &quot;Rosie Frost and the Falcon Queen&quot;. The story is about an orphan who travels to Bloodstone Island — an island that is home to a school for extraordinary teens and a refuge for animals, where she uncovers a dark family secret.

==Other ventures==
===Fashion===
In 2010, Halliwell partnered with British retailer Next to create a swimwear collection named &quot;Geri by Next&quot;. This was followed by a Union Jack-motif clothing range in 2012, inspired by Halliwell&#x27;s famous 1997 Union Jack dress.

===Philanthropy===
In 1998, Halliwell became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). In 2000 Halliwell appeared in the two-part documentary series &quot;Geri&#x27;s World Walkabout&quot; for the BBC, which followed her work with the UN and other travels. That same year, she gave the opening address at the UN Youth Summit. Halliwell picked up further UN work in 2006, by visiting Zambia from 14 to 16 November, to promote greater international awareness of the urgent need to reduce maternal death and halt the spread of HIV/AIDS. In September 2009, Halliwell, in her role as a Goodwill Ambassador of UNFPA, visited Nepal to help launch a national campaign to stop violence against women.

On 25 October 2015, the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; reported that Halliwell had been in talks with the Department for Education with a view to establishing a free school in north London, scheduled to open in 2018 and specialising in the arts and business. Halliwell told the newspaper: &quot;I believe in education. It&#x27;s an empowering fundamental human right that everyone deserves. Education is a foundation for life.&quot; The Department subsequently confirmed that it had spoken with Halliwell, but that discussions were at an early stage.

===Politics===
In the run-up to the 1997 general election, Halliwell declared: &quot;I saw a lot of what Mrs. Thatcher did. She was definitely the original Spice Girl rising from the greengrocer&#x27;s daughter to Prime Minister.&quot; She said in 1996 that Tony Blair was &quot;not a safe pair of hands for the economy&quot;. By the 2001 general election, Halliwell had switched her support to Tony Blair and the Labour Party, making a cameo appearance in one of their party election broadcasts.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Halliwell said she was a feminist, but took issue with its image, explaining: &quot;It&#x27;s about branding. For me, feminism is bra-burning lesbianism. It&#x27;s very unglamorous. I&#x27;d like to see it rebranded. We need to see a celebration of our femininity and softness.&quot;

Following the death of Margaret Thatcher in 2013, Halliwell paid tribute to Thatcher on Twitter and wrote &quot;Thinking of our 1st Lady of girl power, Margaret Thatcher, a green grocer&#x27;s daughter who taught me any thing is possible...x&quot; before deleting the post in response to negative comments from fans. Halliwell later expressed regret for deleting the Tweet and wrote on her personal blog &quot;Now I realise that I do admire a woman, whether she is right or wrong, regardless of her opinions. She had the courage to stand by her convictions. Not like me. I look at my behavior, which exposed how weak I was under fire, not like Margaret Thatcher. Rest in peace.&quot;

In 2019, Halliwell named Winston Churchill as a historical British figure she admired.

In 2022, Halliwell posed for photographs with Conservative Party politicians Nadine Dorries and Liz Truss (then the British foreign secretary) during the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 final and reportedly endorsed Truss&#x27; campaign in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election.
==Personal life==

In 2001, Halliwell was in a short-term relationship with the pop singer Robbie Williams.

Halliwell gave birth to her daughter in May 2006. The child&#x27;s father is screenwriter Sacha Gervasi with whom Halliwell was in a relationship in 2005; Victoria Beckham and Emma Bunton are godmothers. 

Halliwell began dating Christian Horner, the team principal of the Red Bull Racing Formula One team, in February 2014. They announced their engagement on 11 November 2014 and the couple were married on 15 May 2015 at St Mary&#x27;s Church in Woburn, Bedfordshire. In October 2016, Halliwell said that Horner and she were expecting their first child together. Halliwell gave birth to a son on 21 January 2017. 

In a 2019 interview with Piers Morgan, Melanie Brown was asked if she had slept with Halliwell in an intimate manner and she nodded yes. Halliwell released a statement saying that the press reports following the interview had been &quot;hurtful to her family&quot;. Brown responded: &quot;I just said it was like a little thing and we giggled about it the next day and that’s that. It’s the press [who] have taken it onto a whole new level.&quot;

Halliwell&#x27;s first dog, Harry, came from Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home. She later adopted Daisy, who survived life-saving liver surgery at just six months old, as seen on &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady: For the Love of Dogs.&quot;

Halliwell has spoken out about her experiences of bulimia, saying that she came close to death, weighing just , and was advised by Robbie Williams to seek medical help. In 2011, she spoke of being comfortable with her body and credits her newly healthy relationship with food to motherhood. After having previously been agnostic, Halliwell became a Christian after taking the Alpha Course evangelical program.

Halliwell&#x27;s brother, Max, died on 17 November 2021, at age 54.

<text>Cannibal squeeze or suicide squeeze is a type of squeeze in bridge or whist, in which a defender is squeezed by a card played by his partner. Normally, this occurs with less-than-perfect defense, but there are also legitimate positions where the defense could not have prevailed.

==Examples==
 West is on lead. If he cashes the high heart, a club is thrown from the dummy, and East is squeezed. Whichever card East discards, the declarer will take two tricks in that suit. Instead, West must lead a diamond to protect the partner from subsequent endplay (if he returns a club, the declarer will take the King and put East in with another club, forcing him to lead into AQ).

The most common position for a legitimate suicide squeeze occurs when a side suit is &quot;tangled&quot; (neither side can lead it without giving up a trick), and another suit is protected by the partner of the player on lead, as in the following diagram:
 West is to lead; if he leads a diamond, it will &quot;untangle&quot; the suit for the declarer, who will take two diamond tricks. However, when he leads the high heart, he induces a simple squeeze on his partner, who must either discard the high 7 or unguard the diamond king. (Dummy has an idle card, and East is to play before the declarer.) Again declarer will take two tricks.
