<doc id="265079" wikidata="Q747907" url="?curid=265079" title="Syntax highlighting">
<text>Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that is used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colours and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. This feature is also employed in many programming related contexts (such as programming manuals), either in the form of colorful books or online websites to make understanding code snippets easier for readers. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.

Syntax highlighting is a form of secondary notation, since the highlights are not part of the text meaning, but serve to reinforce it. Some editors also integrate syntax highlighting with other features, such as spell checking or code folding, as aids to editing which are external to the language.

==Practical benefits==

Syntax highlighting is one strategy to improve the readability and context of the text; especially for code that spans several pages. The reader can easily ignore large sections of comments or code, depending on what they are looking for.
Syntax highlighting also helps programmers find errors in their program. For example, most editors highlight string literals in a different color. Consequently, spotting a missing delimiter is much easier because of the contrasting color of the text. Brace matching is another important feature with many popular editors. This makes it simple to see if a brace has been left out or locate the match of the brace the cursor is on by highlighting the pair in a different color.

A study published in the conference PPIG evaluated the effects of syntax highlighting on the comprehension of short programs, finding that the presence of syntax highlighting significantly reduces the time taken for a programmer to internalise the semantics of a program. Additionally, data gathered from an eye-tracker during the study suggested that syntax highlighting enables programmers to pay less attention to standard syntactic components such as keywords.

==Support in text editors==

Some text editors can also export the coloured markup in a format that is suitable for printing or for importing into word-processing and other kinds of text-formatting software; for instance as a HTML, colorized LaTeX, PostScript or RTF version of its syntax highlighting. There are several syntax highlighting libraries or &quot;engines&quot; that can be used in other applications, but are not complete programs in themselves, for example the Generic Syntax Highlighter (GeSHi) extension for PHP.

For editors that support more than one language, the user can usually specify the language of the text, such as C, LaTeX, HTML, or the text editor can automatically recognize it based on the file extension or by scanning contents of the file. This automatic language detection presents potential problems. For example, a user may want to edit a document containing:
* more than one language (for example when editing an HTML file that contains embedded JavaScript code),
* a language that is not recognized (for example when editing source code for an obscure or relatively new programming language),
* a language that differs from the file type (for example when editing source code in an extension-less file in an editor that uses file extensions to detect the language).

In these cases, it is not clear what language to use, and a document may not be highlighted or be highlighted incorrectly. Some tools, like Guesslang and PLangRec, are designed to detect the programming language from the source code.

==Syntax elements==
Most editors with syntax highlighting allow different colors and text styles to be given to dozens of different lexical sub-elements of syntax. These include keywords, comments, control-flow statements, variables, and other elements. Programmers often heavily customize their settings in an attempt to show as much useful information as possible without making the code difficult to read.

Called &quot;syntax decoration&quot;, some editors also display certain syntactical elements in more visually pleasing ways, for example by replacing a pointer operator like codice_1 in source code by an actual arrow symbol (→), or changing text decoration clues like /italics/, *boldface*, or _underline_ in source code comments by an actual &quot;italics&quot;, boldface, or underlined presentation.

===Examples===
Below is a comparison of a snippet of C code:

Below is another snippet of syntax highlighted C++ code:

// Create &quot;window_count&quot; Window objects:
const auto window_count = int{10};
auto windows = std::array&lt;std::shared_ptr&lt;Window&gt;, max_window_count&gt;{};
for (auto i = int{0}; i &lt; window_count; ++i) {
 windows[i] = std::make_shared&lt;Window&gt;();


In the C++ example, the editor has recognized the keywords codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, and codice_5. The comment at the beginning is also highlighted in a specific manner to distinguish it from working code.

==History and limitations==
The ideas of syntax highlighting overlap significantly with those of syntax-directed editors. One of the first such editors for code was Wilfred Hansen&#x27;s 1969 code editor, Emily. It provided advanced language-independent code completion facilities, and unlike modern editors with syntax highlighting, actually made it impossible to create syntactically incorrect programs.

In 1982, Anita H. Klock and Jan B. Chodak filed a patent for the first known syntax highlighting system, which was used in the Intellivision&#x27;s Entertainment Computer System (ECS) peripheral, released in 1983. It would highlight different elements of BASIC programs and was implemented in an attempt to make it easier for beginners, especially children, to start writing code. Later, the Live Parsing Editor (LEXX) written for the VM operating system for the computerization of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 1985 was one of the first to use color syntax highlighting. Its &quot;live parsing&quot; capability allowed user-supplied parsers to be added to the editor, for text, programs, data file, etc. On microcomputers, &quot;MacPascal 1.0&quot; (October 10, 1985) recognized Pascal syntax as it was typed and used font changes (e.g., bold for keywords) to highlight syntax on the monochrome compact Macintosh and automatically indented code to match its structure.

Some text editors and code formatting tools perform syntax highlighting using pattern matching heuristics (e.g. Regular expressions) rather than implementing a parser for each possible language. This can result in a text rendering system displaying somewhat inaccurate syntax highlighting and in some cases performing slowly. A solution used by text editors to overcome this problem is not always parsing the whole file but rather just the visible area, sometimes scanning backwards in the text up to a limited number of lines for &quot;syncing&quot;.

On the other hand, the editor often displays code during its creation, while it is incomplete or incorrect, and the strict parsers (like ones used in compilers) would fail to parse the code most of the time.

Some modern, language-specific IDEs (in contrast to text editors) perform full language parsing which results in very accurate understanding of code. An extension of syntax highlighting was called &quot;semantic highlighting&quot; in 2009 by David Nolden for the open-source C++ IDE KDevelop. For example, semantic highlighting may give local variables unique distinct colors to improve the comprehensibility of code. In 2014 the idea of colored local variables was further popularized due to a blog post by Evan Brooks, and after that, the idea was transferred to other popular IDEs like Visual Studio, Xcode, and others.

Color in a user interface is less useful if the user has some degree of color blindness.

<text>The history of the United States from 1917 to 1945 was marked by World War I, the interwar period, the Great Depression, and World War II.

The United States tried and failed to broker a peace settlement for World War I, then entered the war after Germany launched a submarine campaign against U.S. merchant ships that were supplying Germany&#x27;s enemy countries. The publicly stated goals were to uphold American honor, crush German militarism, and reshape the postwar world. After a slow mobilization, the United States of America helped bring about a decisive victory by supplying badly needed financing, food, and millions of fresh and eager soldiers. After the war, the United States of America rejected the Treaty of Versailles and did not join the League of Nations.

In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol was prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Possession of liquor, and drinking it, was never illegal before. The overall level of alcohol consumption did go down, however, state and local governments avoided aggressive enforcement. The federal government was overwhelmed with cases, so that bootlegging and speakeasies flourished in every city. Well-organized criminal gangs exploded in numbers, finances, power, and influence on city politics.

A few local domestic-terrorist attacks from radicals, like the 1920 Wall Street Bombing and the 1919 United States anarchist bombings sparked the first Red Scare. Culture wars between fundamentalist Christians and modernists became more intense, as demonstrated by prohibition, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), and the highly publicized Scopes Trial.

The nation enjoyed a period of sustained prosperity in the 1920s. Agriculture went through a bubble in soaring land prices that collapsed in 1921, and that sector remained depressed. Coal mining was shrinking as oil became the main energy source. Otherwise most sectors prospered. Construction flourished as office buildings, factories, paved roads, and new housing was evident everywhere. Automobile production soared, suburban housing expanded and the nation&#x27;s homes, towns and cities were electrified, along with some farms. Prices were stable, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew steadily until 1929, when the financial speculation bubble burst as Wall Street crashed.

In foreign policy President Wilson helped found the League of Nations but the U.S. never joined it, as the Congress refused to give up its constitutional role in declaring war. The nation instead took the initiative to disarm the world, most notably at the Washington Conference in 1921–22. Washington also helped stabilize the European economy through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at stabilizing the traditional ethnic balance and strictly limiting the total inflow. The act completely blocked Asian immigrants, providing no means for them to get in.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression led to government efforts to restart the economy and help its victims. The recovery, however, was very slow. The nadir of the Great Depression was 1933, and recovery was rapid until the recession of 1938 proved a setback. There were no major new industries in the 1930s that were big enough to drive growth the way autos, electricity and construction had been so powerful in the 1920s. GDP surpassed 1929 levels in 1940.

By 1939, isolationist sentiment in America had ebbed, and after the stunning fall of France in 1940 to Nazi Germany, the United States began rearming itself and sent a large stream of money and military supplies to Britain and the Soviet Union. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States entered World War II to fight against Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan, known as the &quot;Axis Powers&quot;. Italy surrendered in 1943, and Germany and Japan in 1945, after massive devastation and loss of life, while the US emerged far richer and with few casualties.

== World War I ==
=== Entry ===

Firmly maintaining neutrality when World War I began in Europe in 1914, the United States helped supply the Allies, but could not ship anything to the Central Powers because of the British blockade of Germany. Sympathies among many politically and culturally influential Americans had favored the British cause from the start of the war, as typified by industrialist Samuel Insull, born in London, who helped young Americans enlist in British or Canadian forces. On the other hand, especially in the Midwest, many Irish Americans and German Americans opposed any American involvement, the Irish because they hated the British, and the Germans because they feared they would come under personal attack. The suffragist movement included many pacifists, and most churches opposed the war.

German efforts to use their submarines (&quot;U-boats&quot;) to blockade Britain resulted in the deaths of American travelers and sailors, and attacks on passenger liners caused public outrage. Most notable was torpedoing without warning the passenger liner &quot;Lusitania&quot; in 1915. Germany promised not to repeat; however it reversed position in early 1917, believing that unrestricted U-boat warfare against all ships headed to Britain would win the war, albeit at the cost of American entry. When Americans read the text of the German offer to Mexico, known as the Zimmermann Telegram, they saw an offer for Mexico to go to war with Germany against the United States, with German funding, with the promise of the return of the lost territories of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. On April 1, 1917, Wilson called for war, emphasizing that the U.S. had to fight to maintain its honor and to have a decisive voice in shaping the new postwar world. Congress voted on April 6, 1917, to declare war, but it was far from unanimous.

=== Germania ===
German Americans were sometimes accused of being too sympathetic to the German Empire. Former president Theodore Roosevelt denounced &quot;hyphenated Americanism&quot;, insisting that dual loyalties were impossible in wartime. A small minority came out for Germany, or ridiculed the British. About 1% of the 480,000 enemy aliens of German birth were imprisoned in 1917–18. The allegations included spying for Germany, or endorsing the German war effort. Thousands were forced to buy war bonds to show their loyalty. One person was killed by a mob; in Collinsville, Illinois, German-born Robert Prager was dragged from jail as a suspected spy and lynched. The war saw a phobia of anything German engulf the nation; sauerkraut was rechristened &quot;liberty cabbage&quot;.

=== Patriotism ===
The Wilson Administration created the Committee on Public Information (CPI) to control war information and provide pro-war propaganda. The private American Protective League, working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was one of many private right-wing &quot;patriotic associations&quot; that sprang up to support the war and at the same time fight labor unions and various left-wing and anti-war organizations. The U.S. Congress passed, and Wilson signed, the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918. The Sedition Act criminalized any expression of opinion that used &quot;disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language&quot; about the U.S. government, flag or armed forces. Government police action, private vigilante groups and public war hysteria compromised the civil liberties of many Americans who disagreed with Wilson&#x27;s policies.

=== Draft ===

The United States was remarkably unprepared for war in 1917, since it had not fought a major conflict since 1865. The military was small by modern standards and used out-dated weapons. A hasty expansion and modernization of the armed forces was thus launched. The draft began in spring 1917 but volunteers were also accepted. Four million men and thousands of women joined the services for the duration.

=== Economic confusion in 1917 ===
In terms of munitions production, the 15 months after April 1917 involved an amazing parade of mistakes, misguided enthusiasm, and confusion. Americans were willing enough, but they did not know their proper role. Washington was unable to figure out what to do when, or even to decide who was in charge. Typical of the confusion was the coal shortage that hit in December 1917. Because coal was by far the major source of energy and heat a grave crisis ensued. There was in fact plenty of coal being mined, but 44,000 loaded freight and coal cars were tied up in horrendous traffic jams in the rail yards of the East Coast. Two hundred ships were waiting in New York Harbor for cargo that was delayed by the mess. The solution included nationalizing the coal mines and the railroads for the duration, shutting down factories one day a week to save fuel, and enforcing a strict system of priorities. Only in March 1918 did Washington finally take control of the crisis

=== Women ===
The war saw many women taking what were traditionally men&#x27;s jobs for the first time. Many worked on the assembly lines of factories, producing tanks, trucks and munitions. For the first time, department stores employed African American women as elevator operators and cafeteria waitresses. The Food Administration helped housewives prepare nutritious meals with less waste and with optimum use of the foods available. Most important, the morale of the women remained high, as millions joined the Red Cross as volunteers to help soldiers and their families. With rare exceptions, the women did not protest the draft.

=== Labor ===
Samuel Gompers, head of the American Federation of Labor, and nearly all labor unions were strong supporters of the war effort. They minimized strikes as wages soared and full employment was reached. The AFL unions strongly encouraged their young men to enlist in the military, and fiercely opposed efforts to reduce recruiting and slow war production by the anti-war labor union called the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and also left-wing Socialists. President Wilson appointed Gompers to the powerful Council of National Defense, where he set up the War Committee on Labor. The AFL membership soared to 2.4 million in 1917. In 1919, the Union tried to make their gains permanent and called a series of major strikes in meat, steel and other industries. The strikes, all of which failed, forced unions back to their position around 1910. Anti-war socialists controlled the IWW, which fought against the war effort and was in turn shut down by legal action by the federal government.

=== American Expeditionary Forces ===
On the battlefields of the Western Front, the fresh American Expeditionary Forces troops were enthusiastically welcomed by the war-weary Allied armies in the summer of 1918. They arrived at the rate of 10,000 a day, at a time that the Imperial German Army was unable to replace its losses. After the Allies turned back the powerful final German offensive (Spring Offensive), the Americans played a central role in the Allied final offensive (Hundred Days Offensive). Victory over Germany was achieved on November 11, 1918.

Using questionnaires filled out by doughboys as they left the Army, Gutièrrez reported they were not cynical or disillusioned. They fought &quot;for honor, manhood, comrades, and adventure, but especially for duty.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===
A popular Tin Pan Alley song of 1919 asked, concerning the United States troops returning from World War I, &quot;How Ya Gonna Keep &#x27;em Down on the Farm (After They&#x27;ve Seen Paree)?&quot;. In fact, many did not remain &quot;down on the farm&quot;; there was a great migration of youth from farms to nearby towns and smaller cities. The average distance moved was only 10 miles (16 km). Few went to the cities with over 100,000 people. However, agriculture became increasingly mechanized with widespread use of the tractor, other heavy equipment, and superior techniques disseminated through County Agents, who were employed by state agricultural colleges and funded by the Federal government.

In 1919, Woodrow Wilson campaigned for congress to ratify the Treaty of Versailles and allow the U.S. to join the new League of Nations, which he had been instrumental in creating. Wilson rejected the Republican compromise on the issue, and it failed for lack of a 2/3 majority. During his grueling cross-country tour to promote the League, Wilson suffered a series of strokes. He never recovered physically and lost his leadership skills and was unable to negotiate or compromise. The Senate rejected entry into the League and the U.S. never joined.

Defeat in the Great War left Germany in a state of revolutionary turmoil and heavily in debt for war reparations, payments to the victorious Allies. The Allies in turn owed large sums to the US Treasury for war loans. Under the multi-national Dawes Plan, American and British banks loaned money to Germany to stabilize its currency and expand production, which then allowed it to pay reparations to countries like Britain and France. In the 1920s, European and American economies reached new levels of industrial production and prosperity.

== 1919: strikes, riots and scares ==
Urban America was in turmoil throughout 1919. The huge number of returning veterans could not find work, something the Wilson administration had given little thought to. After the war, fear of subversion resumed in the context of the Red Scare, massive strikes in major industries (steel, meatpacking) and violent race riots. Radicals bombed Wall Street, and workers went on strike in Seattle in February. During 1919, a series of more than 20 riotous and violent black-white race-related incidents occurred. These included the Chicago, Omaha, and Elaine Race Riots.

A phenomenon known as the &quot;Red Scare&quot; took place 1918–1919. With the rise of violent Communist revolutions in Europe, leftist radicals were emboldened by the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and were eager to respond to Lenin&#x27;s call for world revolution. On May 1, 1919, a parade in Cleveland, Ohio, protesting the imprisonment of the Socialist Party leader, Eugene Debs, erupted into the violent May Day Riots. A series of bombings by the far left in 1919 and assassination attempts further inflamed the situation. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer conducted the Palmer Raids, a series of raids and arrests of non-citizen socialists, anarchists, radical unionists, and immigrants. They were charged with planning to overthrow the government. By 1920, over 10,000 arrests were made, and the immigrants caught up in these raids were deported back to Europe, most notably the anarchist Emma Goldman, who years before had attempted to assassinate industrialist Henry Clay Frick.

==Women&#x27;s suffrage==
After a long period of agitation, U.S. women were able in 1920 to obtain the necessary votes from a majority of men to obtain the right to vote in all state and federal elections. Women participated in the 1920 presidential and congressional elections.

Politicians responded to the new electorate by emphasizing issues of special interest to women, especially prohibition, child health, public schools, and world peace. Women did respond to these issues, but in terms of general voting they shared the same outlook and the same voting behavior as men.

The suffrage organization NAWSA became the League of Women Voters. Alice Paul&#x27;s National Woman&#x27;s Party began lobbying for full equality and the Equal Rights Amendment, which would pass Congress during the second wave of the women&#x27;s movement in 1972, but was not ratified and never took effect. The main surge of women voting came in 1928, when the big-city machines realized they needed the support of women to elect Al Smith, while rural dry counties mobilized women to support Prohibition and vote for Republican Herbert Hoover. Catholic women were reluctant to vote in the early 1920s, but they registered in very large numbers for the 1928 election—the first in which Catholicism was a major issue. A few women were elected to office, but none became especially prominent during this time period. Overall, the women&#x27;s rights movement was dormant in the 1920s, since Susan B. Anthony and the other prominent activists had died, and apart from Alice Paul few younger women came along to replace them.

== Roaring Twenties ==

In the U.S. presidential election of 1920, the Republican Party returned to the White House with the landslide victory of Warren G. Harding, who promised a &quot;return to normalcy&quot; after the years of war, ethnic hatreds, race riots and exhausting reforms. Harding used new advertising techniques to lead the GOP to a massive landslide, carrying the major cities as many Irish Catholics and Germans, feeling betrayed, temporarily deserted the Democrats.

===Prosperity===
Except for a recession in 1920–21, the economy enjoyed a long period of prosperity. Good times were widespread for all sectors (except agriculture and coal mining). New industries flourished especially electric power, movies, automobiles, gasoline, tourist travel, highway construction, and housing.

&quot;The business of America is business,&quot; proclaimed President Coolidge. Entrepreneurship flourished and was widely hailed. Business interests had captured control of the regulatory agencies established before 1915 and used progressive rhetoric, emphasizing technological efficiency and prosperity as the keys to social improvement. William Allen White, a leading progressive spokesman, supported GOP candidate Herbert Hoover in 1928 as one who could &quot;spiritualize&quot; business prosperity and make it serve progressive ends.

The energy was a key to the economy, especially electricity, and oil. As electrification reached all the cities and towns, consumers demanded new products such as light bulbs, refrigerators, and toasters. Factories installed electric motors and saw productivity surge. With the oil booms in Texas, Oklahoma, and California, the United States dominated world petroleum production, now even more important in an age of automobiles and trucks.

====Herbert Hoover====
Herbert Hoover became world famous by leading the Commission for Relief in Belgium in World War I. He directed the U.S. Food Administration when the U.S. entered the war and served as Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s. An energetic exponent of progressivism he promoted engineering-style efficiency in business and public service, and promoted standardization, elimination of waste, and international trade. He easily won the Republican presidential nomination in 1928 and defeated Democrat Al Smith in a landslide.

The promise of prosperity made Hoover president, but the reality of economic decline ruined him, as Democrats tarred him with blame for the Great Depression in the United States. He was falsely accused of ignoring the crisis. Starting in late 1929 he tried multiple new ways to reverse the economic collapse as the world-wide Great Depression engulfed the United States. He called in all the experts for advice and looked for voluntary solutions that did not require government compulsion. No matter what he did the economy spiraled downward, hitting bottom just as he left office in early 1933. He lacked the political skills to rally support and was defeated in a landslide in 1932 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. After this loss, Hoover became staunchly conservative, and spoke widely against liberal New Deal policies.

===Unions===
Labor unions grew very rapidly during the war, emerging with a large membership, full treasuries, and a temporary government guarantee of the right of collective bargaining. Inflation was high during the war, but wages went up even faster. However, unions were weak in heavy industry, such as automobiles and steel. Their main strength was in construction, printing, railroads, and other crafts where the AFL had a strong system in place. Total union membership had soared from 2.7 million in 1914 to 5 million at its peak in 1919. An aggressive spirit appeared in 1919, as demonstrated by the general strike in Seattle and the police strike in Boston. The larger unions made a dramatic move for expansion in 1919 by calling major strikes in clothing, meatpacking, steel, coal, and railroads. The corporations fought back, and the strikes failed. The unions held on to their gains among machinists, textile workers, and seamen, and in such industries as food and clothing, but overall membership fell back to 3.5 million, where it stagnated until the New Deal passed the Wagner Act in 1935.

Real earnings (after taking inflation, unemployment, and short hours into account) of all employees doubled over 1918–45. Setting 1918 as 100, the index went to 112 in 1923, 122 in 1929, 81 in 1933 (the low point of the depression), 116 in 1940, and 198 in 1945.

The bubble of the late 1920s was reflected by the extension of credit to a dangerous degree, including in the stock market, which rose to record high levels. Government size had been at low levels, causing major freedom of the economy and more prosperity. It became apparent in retrospect after the stock market crash of 1929 that credit levels had become dangerously inflated.

===Immigration restriction===

The United States became more anti-immigration in outlook during this period. The American Immigration Act of 1924 limited immigration from countries where 2% of the total U.S. population, per the 1890 census (not counting African Americans), were immigrants from that country. Thus, the massive influx of Europeans that had come to America during the first two decades of the century slowed to a trickle. Asians and citizens of India were prohibited from immigrating altogether.

===Jazz===

The &quot;Jazz Age&quot; symbolized the popularity of new musics and dance forms, which attracted younger people in all the large cities as the older generation worried about the threat of looser sexual standards as suggested by the uninhibited &quot;flapper.&quot; In every locality, Hollywood discovered an audience for its silent films. It was an age of celebrities and heroes, with movie stars, boxers, home run hitters, tennis aces, and football standouts grabbing widespread attention.

Black culture, especially in music and literature, flourished in many cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and Chicago but nowhere more than in New York City, site of the Harlem Renaissance. The Cotton Club nightclub and the Apollo Theater became famous venues for artists and writers.

Radio was a new industry that grew explosively from homemade crystal sets, picking up faraway stations to stations in every large city by the mid-decade. By 1927 two national networks had been formed, the NBC Red Network and the Blue Network (ABC). The broadcast fare was mostly music, especially by big bands.

=== Prohibition ===

In 1920, the manufacture, sale, import and export of alcohol was prohibited by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in an attempt to alleviate high rates of alcoholism and, especially, political corruption led by saloon-based politicians. It was enforced at the federal level by the Volstead Act. Most states let the federals do the enforcing. Drinking or owning liquor was not illegal, only the manufacture or sale. National Prohibition ended in 1933, although it continued for a while in some states. Prohibition is considered by most (but not all) historians to have been a failure because organized crime was strengthened.

=== Ku Klux Klan ===
Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is the name of three entirely different organizations (1860s, 1920s, post 1960) that used the same nomenclature and costumes but had no direct connection. The KKK of the 1920s was a purification movement that rallied against crime, especially violation of prohibition, and decried the growing &quot;influence&quot; of &quot;big-city&quot; Catholics and Jews, many of them immigrants and their descendants from Ireland as well as Southern and Eastern Europe. Its membership was often exaggerated but possibly reached as many as 4 million men, but no prominent national figure claimed membership; no daily newspaper endorsed it, and indeed most actively opposed the Klan. Membership was verily evenly spread across the nation&#x27;s white Protestants, North, West, and South, urban and rural. Historians in recent years have explored the Klan in depth. The KKK of the 1860s and the current KKK were indeed violent. However, historians discount lurid tales of a murderous group in the 1920s. Some crimes were probably committed in Deep South states but were quite uncommon elsewhere. The local Klans seem to have been poorly organized and were exploited as money-making devices by organizers more than anything else. (Organizers charged a $10 application fee and up to $50 for costumes.) Nonetheless, the KKK had become prominent enough that it staged a huge rally in Washington DC in 1925. Soon afterward, the national headlines reported rape and murder by the KKK leader in Indiana, and the group quickly lost its mystique and nearly all its members.

=== Scopes &quot;Monkey&quot; Trial ===
The Scopes Trial of 1925 was a Tennessee court case that tested a state law which forbade the teaching of &quot;any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.&quot; The law was the result of a systematic drive by religious Fundamentalists to throw back the onslaught of modern ideas in theology and science. In a spectacular trial that drew national attention thanks to the roles of three-time Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan for the prosecution and famed lawyer Clarence Darrow for the defense, John T. Scopes was convicted of teaching evolution, but the verdict was overturned on a technicality. The Fundamentalists were widely ridiculed, with writers like H. L. Mencken poking merciless ridicule at them; their efforts to pass state laws proved a failure.

=== Federal government ===

Led by Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover, the federal government in the 1920s took on an increasing role in business and economic affairs. In addition to Prohibition, the government obtained new powers and duties such as funding and overseeing the new U.S. Highway system, controlling agriculture, and regulating radio and commercial aviation. The result was a rapid spread of standardized roads and broadcasts that were welcomed by most Americans.

The Harding Administration was rocked by the Teapot Dome scandal, the most famous of a number of episodes involving Harding&#x27;s cabinet members. The president, exhausted and dismayed from the news of the scandals, died of a heart attack in August 1923. His vice-president, Calvin Coolidge, succeeded him. Coolidge could not have been a more different personality than his predecessor. Dour, puritanical, and spotlessly honest, his White House stood in sharp contrast to the drinking, gambling, and womanizing that went on under Harding. In 1924, he was easily elected in his own right with the slogan &quot;Keep Cool With Coolidge&quot;. Overall, the Harding and Coolidge administrations marked a return to the hands-off style of 19th-century presidents in contrast to the activism of Roosevelt and Wilson. Coolidge, who spent the entire summer on vacation during his years in office, famously said &quot;The business of the American people is business.&quot;

When Coolidge declined to run again in the 1928 election, the Republican Party nominated engineer and Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, who was elected by a wide margin over Al Smith, the first Catholic nominee. Hoover was a technocrat who had low regard for politicians. Instead he was a believer in the efficacy of individualism and business enterprise, with a little coordination by the government, to cure all problems. He envisioned a future of unbounded plenty and the imminent end of poverty in America. A year after his election, the stock market crashed, and the nation&#x27;s economy slipped downward into the Great Depression.

After the crash, Hoover attempted to put in place many efforts to restore the economy, especially the fast-sinking agricultural sector. None worked. Hoover believed in stimulus spending and encouraged state and local governments, as well as the federal government, to spend heavily on public buildings, roads, bridges—and, most famously, the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. But with tax revenues falling fast, the states and localities plunged into their own fiscal crises. Republicans, following their traditional mass drums, along with pressure from the farm bloc, passed the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs. Canada and other nations retaliated by raising their tariffs on American goods and moving their trade in other directions. American imports and exports plunged by more than two thirds, but since international trade was less than 5% of the American economy, the damage done was limited. The entire world economy, led by the United States, had fallen into a downward spiral that got worse and worse, and in 1931–32 began plunging downward even faster. Hoover had Congress set up a new relief agency, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in 1932, but it proved too little too late.

===Foreign policy, 1919–1941===

In the 1920s, American policy was an active involvement in international affairs, while systematically ignoring the League of Nations. Instead Washington set up numerous diplomatic ventures, and used the enormous financial power of the United States to dictate major diplomatic questions in Europe.

Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover avoided any political commitments or alliances with anyone else. Franklin Roosevelt followed suit before World War II broke out in 1939. They minimized contact with the League of Nations. However, as historian Jerald Combs reports their administrations in no way returned to 19th-century isolationism. The key Republican leaders:
: including Elihu Root, Charles Evans Hughes, and Hoover himself, were Progressives who accepted much of Wilson&#x27;s internationalism. ... They did seek to use American political influence and economic power to goad European governments to moderate the Versailles peace terms, induce the Europeans to settle their quarrels peacefully, secure disarmament agreements, and strengthen the European capitalist economies to provide prosperity for them and their American trading partners.
The Washington Naval Conference was the most successful diplomatic venture in the 1920s. It was held in Washington, under the Chairmanship of Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes from 12 November 1921 to 6 February 1922. Conducted outside the auspice of the League of Nations, it was attended by nine nations—the United States, Japan, China, France, Great Britain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Portugal Russia and Germany were pariahs and were not invited. It focused on resolving misunderstandings or conflicts regarding interests in the Pacific Ocean and East Asia. The main achievement was a series of naval disarmament agreements agreed to by all the participants, that lasted for a decade. It resulted in three major treaties: Four-Power Treaty, Five-Power Treaty (the &quot;Washington Naval Treaty&quot;), the Nine-Power Treaty, and a number of smaller agreements. These treaties preserved peace during the 1920s but were not renewed, as the world scene turned increasingly negative after 1930.

The Dawes Plan was a multi-national attempt to solve to the crisis of reparations that arose when Germany failed to meet the war reparations required of it under the Treaty of Versailles. When Germany was declared in default, French and Belgian troops occupied the key industrial Ruhr district of Germany. The crisis was solved by a compromise in the form of the Dawes Plan in 1924. Under the plan, developed by a committee headed by American Charles G. Dawes, New York and London banks loaned Germany hundreds of millions of dollars to stabilize its currency and expand production, which then allowed it to pay reparations. Problems with the Dawes Plan, notably its lack of a total reparations amount, led to the 1928 Young Plan, developed under the leadership of the American Owen D. Young. It established German reparation requirements at 112 billion marks () and created a schedule of payments that would see Germany complete payments by 1988. As a result of the severe impact of the Great Depression on the German economy, reparations were suspended for a year in 1931. A treaty to further reduce reparations was agreed on at the 1932 Lausanne Conference, but it failed to be ratified by the countries involved. Reparations were not restarted until after 1953, when West Germany paid the entire remaining balance.

===Mexico===

Since the turmoil of the Mexican revolution had died down, the Harding administration was prepared to normalize relations with Mexico. Between 1911 and 1920 American imports from Mexico increased from $57,000,000 to $179,000,000 and exports from $61,000,000 to $208,000,000. Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover took the lead in order to promote trade and investments other than in oil and land, which had long dominated bilateral economic ties. President Álvaro Obregón assured Americans that they would be protected in Mexico, and Mexico was granted recognition in 1923. A major crisis erupted in the mid-1930s when the Mexican government expropriated millions of acres of land from hundreds of American property owners as part of President Lázaro Cárdenas&#x27;s land redistribution program. No compensation was provided to the American owners. The emerging threat of the Second World War forced the United States to agree to a compromise solution. The US negotiated an agreement with President Manuel Avila Camacho that amounted to a military alliance.

===Intervention ends in Latin America===
Small-scale military interventions continued after 1921 as the Banana Wars tapered off. The Hoover administration began a goodwill policy and withdrew all military forces. President Roosevelt announced the &quot;Good Neighbor Policy&quot; by which the United States would no longer intervene to promote good government, but would accept whatever governments were locally chosen. His Secretary of State Cordell Hull endorsed article 8 of the 1933 Montevideo Convention on Rights and Duties of States; it provides that &quot;no state has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another&quot;.

===Isolationism in 1930s===
In the 1930s, the United States entered the period of deep isolationism, rejecting international conferences, and focusing moment mostly on reciprocal tariff agreements with smaller countries of Latin America.

===Coming of war: 1937–1941===

President Roosevelt tried to avoid repeating what he saw as Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s mistakes in World War I. He often made exactly the opposite decision. Wilson called for neutrality in thought and deed, while Roosevelt made it clear his administration strongly favored Britain and China. Unlike the loans in World War I, the United States made large-scale grants of military and economic aid to the Allies through Lend-Lease, with little expectation of repayment. Wilson did not greatly expand war production before the declaration of war; Roosevelt did. Wilson waited for the declaration to begin a draft; Roosevelt started one in 1940. Wilson never made the United States an official ally but Roosevelt did. Wilson never met with the top Allied leaders but Roosevelt did. Wilson proclaimed independent policy, as seen in the 14 Points, while Roosevelt always had a collaborative policy with the Allies. In 1917, United States declared war on Germany; in 1941, Roosevelt waited until the enemy attacked at Pearl Harbor. Wilson refused to collaborate with the Republicans; Roosevelt named leading Republicans to head the War Department and the Navy Department. Wilson let General John J. Pershing make the major military decisions; Roosevelt made the major decisions in his war including the &quot;Europe first&quot; strategy. He rejected the idea of an armistice and demanded unconditional surrender. Roosevelt often mentioned his role in the Wilson administration, but added that he had profited more from Wilson&#x27;s errors than from his successes.

== Great Depression ==

Historians and economists still have not agreed on the causes of the Great Depression, but there is general agreement that it began in the United States in late 1929 and was either started or worsened by &quot;Black Thursday,&quot; the stock market crash of Thursday, October 29, 1929. Sectors of the US economy had been showing some signs of distress for months before October 1929. Business inventories of all types were three times as large as they had been a year before (an indication that the public was not buying products as rapidly as in the past), and other signposts of economic health—freight carloads, industrial production, and wholesale prices—were slipping downward.

The events in the United States triggered a worldwide depression, which led to deflation and a great increase in unemployment. In the United States between 1929 and 1933, unemployment soared from 3% of the workforce to 25%, while manufacturing output collapsed by one-third. Local relief was overwhelmed. Unable to support their families, many unemployed men deserted (often going to &quot;Hoovervilles&quot;) so the meager relief supplies their families received would stretch further. For many, their next meal was found at a soup kitchen, if at all.

Adding to the misery of the times, drought arrived in the Great Plains. Decades of bad farming practices caused the topsoil to erode, and combined with the weather conditions (the 1930s was the overall warmest decade of the 20th century in North America) caused an ecological disaster. The dry soil was lifted by wind and blown into huge dust storms that blanketed entire towns, a phenomenon that continued for several years. Those who had lost their homes and livelihoods in the Dust Bowl were lured westward by advertisements for work put out by agribusiness in western states, such as California. The migrants came to be called Okies, Arkies, and other derogatory names as they flooded the labor supply of the agricultural fields, driving down wages, pitting desperate workers against each other. They came into competition with Mexican laborers, who were deported en masse back to their home country.

In the South, the fragile economy collapsed further. To escape, rural workers and sharecroppers migrated north by train, both black and white. By 1940 they were attracted by booming munitions factories in plants in the Great Lakes region Nationwide, farmers had been experiencing depressed market conditions for their crops and goods since the end of World War I. Many family farms that had been mortgaged during the 1920s to provide money to &quot;get through until better times&quot; were foreclosed when farmers were unable to make payments.

=== The New Deal ===

In the United States, upon accepting Democratic nomination for president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt promised &quot;a new deal for the American people,&quot; a phrase that has endured as a label for his administration and its many domestic achievements.

The Republicans, blamed for the Depression, or at least for lack of an adequate response to it, were easily defeated by Roosevelt in 1932.

Roosevelt entered office with no single ideology or plan for dealing with the depression. The &quot;new deal&quot; was often contradictory, pragmatic, and experimental. What some considered incoherence of the New Deal&#x27;s ideology, however, was the presence of several competing ones, based on programs and ideas not without precedents in the American political tradition. The New Deal consisted of many different efforts to end the Great Depression and reform the American economy. Many of them failed, but there were enough successes to establish it as the most important episode of the 20th century in the creation of the modern American state.

The desperate economic situation, combined with the substantial Democratic victories in the 1932 Congressional elections, gave Roosevelt unusual influence over Congress in the &quot;First Hundred Days&quot; of his administration. He used his leverage to win rapid passage of a series of measures to create welfare programs and regulate the banking system, stock market, industry and agriculture.

=== &quot;Bank holiday&quot; and Emergency Banking Act ===

On March 6, two days after taking office, Roosevelt issued a proclamation closing all American banks for four days until Congress could meet in a special session. Ordinarily, such an action would cause widespread panic. But the action created a general sense of relief. First, many states had already closed down the banks before March 6. Second, Roosevelt astutely and euphemistically described it as a &quot;bank holiday.&quot; And third, the action demonstrated that the federal government was stepping in to stop the alarming pattern of bank failures.

Three days later, President Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act, a generally conservative bill, drafted in large part by holdovers from the Hoover administration, designed primarily to protect large banks from being dragged down by the failing smaller ones. The bill provided for United States Treasury Department inspection of all banks before they would be allowed to reopen, for federal assistance to tottering large institutions, and for a thorough reorganization of those in greatest difficulty. A confused and frightened Congress passed the bill within four hours of its introduction. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days, and $1 billion in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month. The immediate banking crisis was over. The Glass–Steagall Act established various provisions designed to prevent another Great Depression from happening again. These included separating investment from savings and loan banks and forbidding the purchase of stock with no money down. Roosevelt also removed the currency of the United States from the gold standard, which was widely blamed for limiting the money supply and causing deflation, although the silver standard remained until 1971. Private ownership of gold bullion and certificates was banned and would remain so until 1975.

=== Economy Act ===
On the morning after passage of the Emergency Banking Act, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Economy Act, which was designed to convince the public, and moreover the business community, that the federal government was in the hands of no radical. The act proposed to balance the federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and reducing pensions to veterans by as much as 15%.

Otherwise, Roosevelt warned, the nation faced a $1 billion deficit. The bill revealed clearly what Roosevelt had always maintained: that he was as much of a fiscal conservative at heart as his predecessor was. And like the banking bill, it passed through Congress almost instantly—despite heated protests by some congressional progressives.

=== Farm programs ===
The celebrated First Hundred Days of the new administration also produced a federal program to protect American farmers from the uncertainties of the market through subsidies and production controls, the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), which Congress passed in May 1933. The AAA reflected the desires of leaders of various farm organizations and Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace.

Relative farm incomes had been falling for decades. The AAA included reworkings of many long-touted programs for agrarian relief, which had been demanded for decades. The most important provision of the AAA was the provision for crop reductions—the &quot;domestic allotment&quot; system, which was intended to raise prices for farm commodities by preventing surpluses from flooding the market and depressing prices further. The most controversial component of the system was the destruction in summer 1933 of growing crops and newborn livestock that exceeded the allotments. They had to be destroyed to get the plan working. However, gross farm incomes increased by half in the first three years of the New Deal and the relative position of farmers improved significantly for the first time in twenty years. Urban food prices went up slightly, because the cost of the grains was only a small fraction of what the consumer paid. Conditions improved for the great majority of commercial farmers by 1936. The income of the farm sector almost doubled from $4.5 billion in 1932 to $8.9 billion in 1941 just before the war. Meanwhile, food prices rose 22% in nine years from an index of 31.5 in 1932, to 38.4 in 1941.
However, rural America contained many isolated farmers scratching out a subsistence income. The new deal set up programs such as the Resettlement Administration and the Farm Security Administration to help them, but was very reluctant to help them buy farms.

=== &#x27;Alphabet soup&#x27; ===
Roosevelt also created an &quot;alphabet soup&quot; of new federal regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee the stock market and a reform of the banking system that included the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to establish a system of insurance for deposits.

The most successful initiatives in alleviating the miseries of the Great Depression were a series of relief measures to aid some of the 15 million unemployed Americans, among them the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Civil Works Administration, and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration.

The early New Deal also began the Tennessee Valley Authority, an unprecedented experiment in flood control, public power, and regional planning.

=== Second New Deal ===
The Second New Deal (1935–36) was the second stage of the New Deal programs. President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced his main goals in January 1935: improved use of national resources, security against old age, unemployment and illness, and slum clearance, as well as a national welfare program (the WPA) to replace state relief efforts. The most important programs included Social Security, the National Labor Relations Act (&quot;Wagner Act&quot;), the Banking Act, rural electrification, and breaking up utility holding companies. Programs that were later ended by the Supreme Court or the Conservative coalition included the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the National Youth Administration (NYA), the Resettlement Administration, and programs for retail price control, farm rescues, coal stabilization, and taxes on the rich and the Undistributed profits tax. Liberals in Congress passed the Bonus Bill for World War veterans over FDR&#x27;s veto.

The Second New Deal proved especially controversial as it attempted to redistribute wealth, income and power in favor of the poor, the old, farmers and labor unions. Liberals strongly supported the new direction, and formed the New Deal coalition of union members, big city machines, the white South, and ethnic minorities to support it. Conservatives, typified by the American Liberty League, were strongly opposed.

=== Labor agitation ===

Roosevelt&#x27;s first term saw a massive amount of labor upheaval. In 1934 alone, there was the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike that brought all of San Francisco into a four-day general strike, the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934 that brought the Teamsters and other unions out for a strike causing the governor to declare martial law, the 1934 textile workers strike that brought hundreds of thousands of textile workers on the East Coast out on strike, as well as other strikes.

The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and the communists no longer being a force in the labor movement, the conservative American Federation of Labor, which organized along craft union lines and which preached labor/capital cooperation, dominated the U.S. labor movement until the 1930s. In 1935, eight unions within the AFL organized the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to promote industrial unionism. The CIO unions were expelled by the AFL in 1936, and in 1938 they formed a rival federation to the AFL. The CIO had much success in organizing, with the Steel Workers Organizing Committee getting a contract with U.S. Steel in 1937, and winning the Flint Sit-Down Strike and getting General Motors to recognize the United Auto Workers (UAW) as the collective bargainer for GM workers. Having succeeded with GM, the UAW next turned its attention to Chrysler, which quickly came to terms. The last of the Big Three would prove to be a harder nut to crack, as Henry Ford remained absolutely opposed to unions. His security forces beat several UAW organizers outside the company&#x27;s River Rouge plant in May 1937. Despite pressure on all fronts, Ford would not budge until a wildcat strike in 1941 convinced him to give in and unionize.

=== Recession of 1937 and recovery ===
The economy eventually recovered from the low point of the winter of 1932–33, with sustained improvement until 1937, when the Recession of 1937 brought back 1934 levels of unemployment. There is a broad consensus among scholars that the New Deal policies did not lengthen and deepen the depression; only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists believe it served to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression. Apart from the WPA and CCC, most New Deal spending programs, such as the PWA and AAA, operated through private firms.

The New Deal and Roosevelt&#x27;s leadership were under assault during Roosevelt&#x27;s second term, which suffered new economic setbacks in the Recession of 1937. A sharp economic downturn began in the fall of 1937 and continued through most of 1938. Conservatives said it was caused by the labor unions&#x27; assault on industry through massive strikes and the way the New Deal discourages further investment. Keynesian economists argued it was a result of a premature effort by FDR to balance the budget by reducing federal spending. The administration reacted by launching a rhetorical campaign against business monopoly power, which was cast as the villain. The Supreme Court began busily dismantling the New Deal by ruling many of its programs unconstitutional and Roosevelt sought to replace the judges with more sympathetic ones in his infamous &quot;Court Packing&quot;. Despite that, the New Deal gradually wound down and by 1939 the president had turned his attention towards foreign policy.

But the administration&#x27;s other response to the 1937 downturn had more tangible results. Ignoring his own Treasury Department, Roosevelt embarked on an antidote to the depression, reluctantly abandoning his efforts to balance the budget and launching a $5 billion spending program in the spring of 1938, an effort to increase mass purchasing power and attack deflation. Roosevelt explained his program in a fireside chat in which he finally acknowledged that it was up to the government to &quot;create an economic upturn&quot; by making &quot;additions to the purchasing power of the nation.&quot;

=== World War II and the end of the Great Depression ===
It was not until the administration expanded Federal spending to support World War II, that the nation&#x27;s economy fully recovered.
Between 1939 and 1944 (the peak of wartime production), the nation&#x27;s output almost doubled. Consequently, unemployment plummeted—from 14% in 1940 to less than 2% in 1943, as the labor force grew by ten million.

The war economy was not so much a triumph of free enterprise as the result of government bankrolling business. While unemployment remained high throughout the New Deal years, consumption, investment, and net exports—the pillars of economic growth—remained low. It was World War II, not the New Deal, which finally ended the crisis. Nor did the New Deal substantially alter the distribution of power within American society and economy; and it had only a small impact on the distribution of wealth among the population.

=== Legacies of the New Deal ===
A 2017 review of the published scholarship summarized the findings of researchers as follows:The studies find that public works and relief spending had state income multipliers of around one, increased consumption activity, attracted internal migration, reduced crime rates, and lowered several types of mortality. The farm programs typically aided large farm owners but eliminated opportunities for share croppers, tenants, and farm workers. The Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation&#x27;s purchases and refinancing of troubled mortgages staved off drops in housing prices and home ownership rates at relatively low ex post cost to taxpayers. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation&#x27;s loans to banks and railroads appear to have had little positive impact, although the banks were aided when the RFC took ownership stakes.

Although the New Deal did not end the depression, it increased the regulatory functions of the federal government in the stock market, the banking system, and others. It also produced a new political coalition that sustained the Democratic Party as the majority party in national politics for more than a generation after its own end.
Laying the foundations for the postwar era, Roosevelt and the New Deal helped enhance the power of the federal government as a whole. Roosevelt also established the presidency as the preeminent center of authority within the federal government. By creating a large array of protections for various groups of citizens—workers, farmers, and others—who suffered from the crisis, enabling them to challenge the powers of the corporations, the Roosevelt administration generated a set of political ideas—known to later generations as New Deal liberalism—that remained a source of inspiration for decades and that helped shape the next experiment in liberal reform, the Great Society of the 1960s.

On the other hand, the Roosevelt administration and its liberalism became the source of a vigorous conservative reaction. Led in Congress by Senator Robert A. Taft and the Conservative coalition, they blocked almost all New Deal proposals after 1936, and shut down the WPA, CCC and many other programs by 1943. Eventually in the 1970s and 1980s, a bipartisan coalition ended most New Deal regulations and programs. The most important remaining ones in the 21st century are Social Security and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

== World War II ==
===Foreign and military policy===

Isolationist sentiment with regard to foreign wars in America had ebbed, but the United States at first declined to enter the war, limiting itself to giving supplies and weapons via Lend Lease to Britain, China, and the Soviet Union. American feeling changed drastically with the sudden Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. enthusiastically went to war against Japan, Italy, and Nazi Germany. Italy surrendered in 1943, followed by Germany and Japan in 1945. The United States was one of the &quot;Allied Big Four&quot;, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China. The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence. The economy doubled and tripled in size as a massive industrial mobilization was accompanied by artificial wage and price controls. 16 million men entered the military (most were drafted), in addition to 300,000 women volunteers. After a series of defeats inflicted by Japan, the U.S. Navy turned the tide at Midway (June 1942), then inexorably moved toward total destruction of the Japanese military. After small-scale invasions of North Africa (1942) and Italy (1943), the main American effort was a strategic bombing campaign that destroyed the German Luftwaffe, followed by a massive invasion of France in 1944. American forces met up with Soviet forces marching into Germany from the east in May 1945. Overall, the entire nation was turned into a vast war machine, affecting society more than any other conflict fought by the United States, except perhaps the Civil War.

After winning re-election to unprecedented third and fourth terms, Roosevelt&#x27;s health was rapidly deteriorating; he died on April 12, 1945. Harry S. Truman had not been kept informed of major foreign policy and military decisions, but he continued most of Roosevelt&#x27;s wartime policies. Truman moved sharply to the right in replacing FDR&#x27;s liberal cabinet.

With its merchant fleet sunk by American submarines, Japan ran short of aviation gasoline and fuel oil. The U.S. Navy in June 1944 captured islands within bombing range of Tokyo. Strategic bombing using the B-29 destroyed all the major cities in 1945, as the U.S. captured Iwo Jima and Okinawa after heavy losses. With conventional and atomic bombs falling, an Allied invasion imminent, and an unexpected Soviet attack sweeping through Manchuria, the Emperor of Japan surrendered. Japan was occupied by the Americans under Douglas MacArthur; MacArthur&#x27;s five year rule transformed Japan&#x27;s government, society and economy along American lines into a peaceful democracy and a close ally of the U.S.

===Homefront===
====Economics====
The main contributions of the U.S. to the Allied war effort comprised money, industrial output, food, petroleum, technological innovation, and (especially 1944–45), soldiers. Much of the focus in Washington was maximizing the economic output of the nation. The overall result was a dramatic increase in GDP, the export of vast quantities of supplies to the Allies and to American forces overseas, the end of unemployment, and a rise in civilian consumption even as 40% of the GDP went to the war effort. This was achieved by tens of millions of workers moving from low-productivity occupations to high efficiency jobs, improvements in productivity through better technology and management, and the move into the active labor force of students, retired people, housewives, and the unemployed, and an increase in hours worked. It was exhausting; leisure activities declined sharply. People tolerated the extra work because of patriotism, the pay, and the confidence it was only &quot;for the duration&quot; and life would return to normal as soon as the war was won. Most durable goods became unavailable, and meat, clothing, and gasoline was tightly rationed. In industrial areas housing was in short supply as people doubled up and lived in cramped quarters. Prices and wages were controlled, and Americans saved a high portion of their incomes, which led to renewed growth after the war instead of a return to depression.

====Taxes and controls====
Federal tax policy was highly contentious during the war, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt battling a conservative Congress. Everyone agreed on the need for high taxes to pay for the war. Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully to impose a 100% tax on incomes over $25,000 (equal to $ today), while Congress enlarged the base downward. By 1944 nearly every employed person was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in 1940).

Many controls were put on the economy. The most important were price controls, imposed on most products and monitored by the Office of Price Administration. Wages were also controlled. Corporations dealt with numerous agencies, especially the War production Board (WPB), and the War and Navy departments, which had the purchasing power and priorities that largely reshaped and expanded industrial production.

====Rationing====

In 1942 a rationing system was begun to guarantee minimum amounts of necessities to everyone (especially poor people) and prevent inflation. Tires were the first item to be rationed in January 1942 because supplies of natural rubber were interrupted. Gasoline rationing proved an even better way to allocate scarce rubber. By 1943 one needed government issued ration coupons to purchase typewriters, sugar, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, fuel oil, silk, nylon, coffee, stoves, shoes, meat, cheese, butter, margarine, canned foods, dried fruits, jam, and many other items. Some items—like new automobiles and appliances—were no longer made. The rationing system did not apply to used goods (like clothes or cars). The ration system was complex and confusing, but high levels of patriotism made it acceptable as people helped each other through the maze of rules.

To get a classification and a book of rationing stamps, one had to appear before a local rationing board. Each person in a household received a ration book, including babies and children. When purchasing gasoline, a driver had to present a gas card along with a ration book and cash. Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to forestall hoarding. All forms of automobile racing were banned, including the Indianapolis 500. Sightseeing driving was banned, too.

People had more money than they could spend, so they saved it, especially in government savings bonds. Bond rallies in many cities featured Hollywood film stars, who drew in the crowds needed to make the program a success. The buyer paid 3/4 of the face value of a war bond, and received the full face value back after a set number of years. Workers were challenged to put &quot;at least 10% of every paycheck into Bonds&quot;. Compliance was very high, with entire factories of workers earning a special &quot;Minuteman&quot; flag to fly over their plant if all workers belonged to the &quot;Ten Percent Club&quot;. There were seven major War Loan drives, all of which exceeded their goals. An added advantage was that citizens who were putting their money into War Bonds were not putting it into the home front wartime economy.

====Work force====

The unemployment problem ended in the United States with the beginning of World War II, when stepped up wartime production created millions of new jobs and the draft pulled young men out of the labor pool.

Women also joined the workforce to replace men who had joined the forces, though in fewer numbers. Roosevelt stated that the efforts of civilians at home to support the war through personal sacrifice was as critical to winning the war as the efforts of the soldiers themselves. &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot; became the symbol of women laboring in manufacturing. The war effort brought about significant changes in the role of women in society as a whole. At the end of the war, many of the munitions factories closed. Other women were replaced by returning veterans. However most women who wanted to continue working did so.

Labor shortages were felt in agriculture, even though most farmers were given an occupational exemption and few were drafted. Large numbers volunteered or moved to cities for factory jobs. At the same time many agricultural commodities were in greater demand by the military and for the civilian populations of Allies. In some areas schools were temporarily closed at harvest time to enable students to work. About 400,000 German prisoners of war were used as farm laborers both during and immediately after the war.

With the war&#x27;s ever increasing need for able bodied men consuming America&#x27;s labor force in the early 1940s, industry turned to teen-aged boys and girls to fill in as replacements. Consequently, many states had to change their child-labor laws to allow these teenagers to work. By 1943, there were almost three million American teenage boys and girls working in American fields and factories.
In the process of bringing great numbers of children into the workforce, the War altered the lives of many adolescents. Lured by high wartime wages, they took jobs and forgot about their education. Between 1940 and 1944, the number of teenage workers in America increased by 1.9 million; the number attending school declined by 1.25 million.

====Labor unions====

The war mobilization changed the relationship of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) with both employers and the national government. Both the CIO and the larger American Federation of Labor (AFL) grew rapidly in the war years.

Nearly all the unions that belonged to the CIO were fully supportive of both the war effort and of the Roosevelt administration. However the United Mine Workers, who had taken an isolationist stand in the years leading up to the war and had opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s reelection in 1940, left the CIO in 1942. The major unions supported a wartime no-strike pledge that aimed to eliminate not only major strikes for new contracts, but also the innumerable small strikes called by shop stewards and local union leadership to protest particular grievances. In return for labor&#x27;s no-strike pledge, the government offered arbitration to determine the wages and other terms of new contracts. Those procedures produced modest wage increases during the first few years of the war but not enough to keep up with inflation, particularly when combined with the slowness of the arbitration machinery.

Even though the complaints from union members about the no-strike pledge became louder and more bitter, the CIO did not abandon it. The Mine Workers, by contrast, who did not belong to either the AFL or the CIO for much of the war, threatened numerous strikes including a successful twelve-day strike in 1943. The strikes and threats made mine leader John L. Lewis a much hated man and led to legislation hostile to unions.

All the major unions grew stronger during the war. The government put pressure on employers to recognize unions to avoid the sort of turbulent struggles over union recognition of the 1930s, while unions were generally able to obtain maintenance of membership clauses, a form of union security, through arbitration and negotiation. Workers also won benefits, such as vacation pay, that had been available only to a few in the past while wage gaps between higher skilled and less skilled workers narrowed. Most union leaders saw women as temporary wartime replacements for the men in the armed forces. It was important that the wages of these women be kept high so that the veterans would get high wages.

====Racial tensions and Japanese American internment====

The cities were relatively peaceful; much-feared large-scale race riots did not happen, but there were small-scale confrontations, notably the 1943 race riot in Detroit and the anti-Mexican Zoot Suit Riots in Los Angeles in 1943. Some German and Italian individuals were rounded up and interned as enemy aliens who lacked U.S. citizenship and were known by the FBI as supporters of the enemy. On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, following claims by California Attorney General Earl Warren and General John L. DeWitt that Japanese-Americans had engaged in pro-Japanese espionage against the U.S. Government. As a result, around 100,000 persons of Japanese ancestry on the West Coast and their children were interned by the U.S. government and sent to inland camps. The 100,000 or more Japanese Americans in Hawaii were not interned. The American camps were closed in February 1945.

==End of an era==
1945 marked the end of an era. In foreign policy the United Nations was established on October 24, 1945, to serve as a world body to help prevent future world wars. By a vote of 65 to 7, the United States Senate, on December 4, 1945, approved the treaty that set full American participation in the UN, with a veto in the all-important Security Council. This marked a turn away from the traditional interest in strategic local concerns of the U.S. and toward more international involvement.

Fears of a postwar depression did not materialize, thanks in part to the large stock of savings that paid for the pent-up demands for housing, cars, new clothes—and babies. The Baby Boom began as the veterans returned, many moving to the rapidly expanding suburbs. Optimism was the hallmark of the new age—an age of grand expectations.

<text>Solomon Islands, also known simply as the Solomons, is an island country consisting of six major islands and over 1000 smaller islands in Melanesia, part of Oceania, to the northeast of Australia. It is directly adjacent to Papua New Guinea to the west, Australia to the southwest, New Caledonia and Vanuatu to the southeast, Fiji, Wallis and Futuna, and Tuvalu to the east, and Nauru and the Federated States of Micronesia to the north. It has a total area of 28,896 square kilometres (11,157 sq mi), and a population of 734,887 according to the official estimates for mid-2023. Its capital and largest city, Honiara, is located on the largest island, Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the wider area of the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (currently a part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes the Santa Cruz Islands.

The islands have been settled since at least some time between 30,000 and 28,800 BC, with later waves of migrants, notably the Lapita people, mixing and producing the modern indigenous Solomon Islanders population. In 1568, the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña was the first European to visit them. Though not named by Mendaña, it is believed that the islands were called &quot;the Solomons&quot; by those who later received word of his voyage and mapped his discovery. Mendaña returned decades later, in 1595, and another Spanish expedition, led by Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, visited the Solomons in 1606.

In June 1893, Captain Herbert Gibson of declared the southern Solomon Islands a British protectorate. During World War II, the Solomon Islands campaign (1942–1945) saw fierce fighting between the United States, British Imperial forces, and the Empire of Japan, including the Battle of Guadalcanal.

The official name of the then-British administration was changed from the &quot;British Solomon Islands Protectorate&quot; to &quot;The Solomon Islands&quot; in 1975, and self-government was achieved the following year. Independence was obtained, and the name changed to just &quot;Solomon Islands&quot; (without the definite article), in 1978. At independence, Solomon Islands became a constitutional monarchy. The King of Solomon Islands is Charles III, who is represented in the country by a governor-general appointed on the advice of the prime minister.

==Name==
In 1568, the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña was the first European to visit the Solomon Islands archipelago but did not name the archipelago at that time, only certain individual islands. Though not named by Mendaña, the islands were subsequently referred to as &quot;Islas Salomón&quot; (Solomon Islands) by others following reports of his voyage optimistically conflated with stories of the wealthy biblical King Solomon, believing them to be the Bible-mentioned city of Ophir. During most of the colonial period, the territory&#x27;s official name was the &quot;British Solomon Islands Protectorate&quot; until independence in 1978, when it was changed to &quot;Solomon Islands&quot; as defined in the Constitution of Solomon Islands and as a Commonwealth realm under this name.

The definite article, &quot;the&quot;, has not been part of the country&#x27;s official name since independence but remains for all references to the area pre-independence and is sometimes used, both within and outside the country. Colloquially, the islands are referred to simply as &quot;the Solomons&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The Solomons were first settled by people coming from the Bismarck Islands and New Guinea during the Pleistocene era 30,000–28,000 BC, based on archaeological evidence found at Kilu Cave on Buka Island in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea. At this point sea levels were lower and Buka and Bougainville were physically joined to the southern Solomons in one landmass (&quot;Greater Bougainville&quot;), though it is unclear precisely how far south these early settlers spread as no other archaeological sites from this period have been found. As sea levels rose as the Ice Age ended 4000–3500 BC, the Greater Bougainville landmass split into the numerous islands that exist today. Evidence of later human settlements dating to 4500–2500 BC have been found at Poha Cave and Vatuluma Posovi Cave on Guadalcanal. The ethnic identity of these early peoples is unclear, though it is thought that the speakers of the Central Solomon languages (a self-contained language family unrelated to other languages spoken in the Solomons) likely represent the descendants of these earlier settlers.

From 1200–800 BC, Austronesian Lapita people began arriving from the Bismarcks with their characteristic ceramics. Evidence for their presence has been found across the Solomon archipelago, as well at the Santa Cruz Islands in the south-east, with different islands being settled at different times. Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Lapita people &quot;leap-frogged&quot; the already inhabited main Solomon Islands and settled first on the Santa Cruz group, with later back-migrations bringing their culture to the main group. These peoples mixed with the native Solomon Islanders and over time their languages became dominant, with most of the 60–70 languages spoken there belonging to the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian language family. Then, as now, communities tended to exist in small villages practising subsistence agriculture, though extensive inter-island trade networks existed. Numerous ancient burial sites and other evidence of permanent settlements have been found from the period AD 1000–1500 throughout the islands, one of the most prominent examples being the Roviana cultural complex centred on the islands off the southern coast of New Georgia, where a large number of megalithic shrines and other structures were constructed in the 13th century. The people of Solomon Islands were notorious for headhunting and cannibalism before the arrival of the Europeans.

===Arrival of Europeans (1568–1886)===
The first European to visit the islands was the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira, sailing from Peru in 1568. Landing on Santa Isabel on 7 February, Mendaña explored several of the other islands including Makira, Guadalcanal and Malaita. Relations with the native Solomon Islanders were initially cordial, although they often soured as time went by. As a result, Mendaña returned to Peru in August 1568. He returned to the Solomons with a larger crew on a second voyage in 1595, aiming to colonise the islands. They landed on Nendö in the Santa Cruz Islands and established a small settlement at Gracioso Bay. However, the settlement failed due to poor relations with the native peoples and epidemics of disease amongst the Spanish which caused numerous deaths, with Mendaña himself dying in October. The new commander Pedro Fernandes de Queirós thus decided to abandon the settlement and they sailed north to the Spanish territory of the Philippines. Queirós later returned to the area in 1606, where he sighted Tikopia and Taumako, though this voyage was primarily to Vanuatu in the search of Terra Australis.

Save for Abel Tasman&#x27;s sighting of the remote Ontong Java Atoll in 1648, no European sailed to the Solomons again until 1767, when the British explorer Philip Carteret sailed by the Santa Cruz Islands, Malaita, and, continuing further north, Bougainville and the Bismarck Islands. French explorers also reached the Solomons, with Louis Antoine de Bougainville naming Choiseul in 1768 and Jean-François de Surville exploring the islands in 1769. In 1788 John Shortland, captaining a supply ship for Britain&#x27;s new Australian colony at Botany Bay, sighted the Treasury and Shortland Islands. That same year the French explorer Jean-François de La Pérouse was wrecked on Vanikoro; a rescue expedition led by Bruni d&#x27;Entrecasteaux sailed to Vanikoro but found no trace of La Pérouse. The fate of La Pérouse was not confirmed until 1826, when the English merchant Peter Dillon visited Tikopia and discovered items belonging to La Pérouse in the possession of the local people, confirmed by the subsequent voyage of Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville in 1828.

Some of the earliest regular foreign visitors to the islands were whaling vessels from Britain, the United States and Australia. They came for food, wood and water from late in the 18th century, establishing a trading relationship with the Solomon Islanders and later taking aboard islanders to serve as crewmen on their ships. Relations between the islanders and visiting seamen were not always good and sometimes there was bloodshed. A knock-on effect of the greater European contact was the spread of diseases to which local peoples had no immunity, as well as a shift in the balance of power between coastal groups, who had access to European weapons and technology, and inland groups who did not. In the second half of the 1800s more traders arrived seeking turtleshells, sea cucumbers, copra and sandalwood, occasionally establishing semi-permanent trading stations. However, initial attempts at more long-term settlement, such as Benjamin Boyd&#x27;s colony on Guadalcanal in 1851, were unsuccessful.
Beginning in the 1840s, and accelerating in the 1860s, islanders began to be recruited (or often kidnapped) as labourers for the colonies in Australia, Fiji and Samoa in a process known as &quot;blackbirding&quot;. Conditions for workers were often poor and exploitative, and local islanders often violently attacked any Europeans who appeared on their island. The blackbird trade was chronicled by prominent Western writers, such as Joe Melvin and Jack London. Christian missionaries also began visiting the Solomons from the 1840s, beginning with an attempt by French Catholics under Jean-Baptiste Epalle to establish a mission on Santa Isabel, which was abandoned after Epalle was killed by islanders in 1845. Anglican missionaries began arriving from the 1850s, followed by other denominations, over time gaining a large number of converts.

===Colonial period (1886–1978)===
====Establishment of colonial rule====
In 1884, Germany annexed northeast New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago and, in 1886, extended its rule over the North Solomon Islands, covering Bougainville, Buka, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, the Shortlands and Ontong Java atoll. In 1886 Germany and Britain confirmed this arrangement, with the British gaining a &quot;sphere of influence&quot; over the southern Solomons. Germany paid little attention to the islands, with German authorities based in New Guinea not even visiting the area until 1888. The German presence, along with pressure from the missionaries to rein in the excesses of the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as blackbirding, prompted the British to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in March 1893, initially encompassing New Georgia, Malaita, Guadalcanal, Makira, Mono Island and the central Nggela Islands.

In April 1896, colonial official Charles Morris Woodford was appointed as the British Acting Deputy Commissioner, and he was confirmed in his position in the following year. The Colonial Office appointed Woodford as the Resident Commissioner in the Solomon Islands on 17 February 1897. He was directed to control the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as blackbirding, operating in the Solomon Island waters and to stop the illegal trade in firearms. Woodford set up an administrative headquarters on the small island of Tulagi, having proclaimed it the protectorate capital in 1896. and in 1898 and 1899 the Rennell and Bellona Islands, Sikaiana, the Santa Cruz Islands and outlying islands such as Anuta, Fataka, Temotu and Tikopia were added to the protectorate. In 1900, under the terms of the Tripartite Convention of 1899, Germany ceded the Northern Solomon to Britain, minus Buka and Bougainville, the latter becoming part of German New Guinea despite geographically belonging to the Solomons archipelago. This was when the Shortlands, Choiseul, Santa Isabel and Ontong Java became part of the Solomons.

Woodford&#x27;s underfunded administration struggled to maintain law and order on the remote colony. From the late 1890s until the early 1900s, there were numerous instances of European merchants and colonists being killed by islanders; the British response was to deploy Royal Navy warships to launch punitive expeditions against the villages which were responsible for the murders. Arthur Mahaffy was appointed at the Deputy Commissioner in January 1898. He was based in Gizo, his duties included suppressing headhunting in New Georgia and neighbouring islands.

The British colonial government attempted to encourage the establishment of plantations by colonists; however, by 1902, there were only about 80 European colonists residing on the islands. Attempts at economic development met with mixed results, though Levers Pacific Plantations Ltd., a subsidiary of Lever Brothers, managed to establish a profitable copra plantation industry which employed many islanders. Small scale mining and logging industries were also developed. However, the colony remained something of a backwater, with education, medical and other social services being under the administration of the missionaries. Violence also continued, most notably with the murder of colonial administrator William R. Bell by Basiana of the Kwaio people on Malaita in 1927, as Bell attempted to enforce an unpopular head tax. Several Kwaio were killed in a retaliatory raid, and Basiana and his accomplices executed.

====World War II====

From 1942 until the end of 1943, the Solomon Islands were the scene of several major land, sea, and air battles between the Allies and the Japanese Empire&#x27;s armed forces. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, war was declared between Japan and the Allied Powers, and the Japanese, seeking to protect their southern flank, invaded South-East Asia and New Guinea. In May 1942, the Japanese launched Operation Mo, occupying Tulagi and most of the western Solomon Islands, including Guadalcanal where they began work on an airstrip. The British administration had already relocated to Auki, Malaita, and most of the European population had been evacuated to Australia. The Allies counter-invaded Guadalcanal in August 1942, followed by the New Georgia campaign in 1943, both of which were turning points in the Pacific War, stopping and then countering the Japanese advance. The conflict resulted in hundreds of thousands of Allied, Japanese and civilian deaths, as well an immense destruction across the islands. The Solomon Islands Campaign cost the Allies approximately 7,100 men, 29 ships, and 615 aircraft. The Japanese lost 31,000 men, 38 ships, and 683 aircraft.

Coastwatchers from the Solomon Islands played a major role in providing intelligence and rescuing other Allied servicemen. U.S. Admiral William Halsey, the commander of Allied forces during the Battle for Guadalcanal, recognised the coastwatchers&#x27; contributions by stating &quot;The coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific.&quot; In addition, around 3,200 men served in the Solomon Islands Labour Corps and some 6,000 enlisted in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force, with their exposure to the Americans leading to several social and political transformations. For example, the Americans had extensively developed Honiara, with the capital shifting there from Tulagi in 1952, and the Pijin language was heavily influenced by the communication between Americans and the Islands inhabitants.


====Post-war period and the lead-up to independence====
In 1943–44 the Malaita-based chief Aliki Nono&#x27;ohimae had founded the Maasina Rule movement (aka the Native Council Movement, literally &quot;Brotherhood Rule&quot;), and was later joined by another chief, Hoasihau. Their aims were to improve the economic well-being of native Solomon Islanders, gain greater autonomy and to act as a liaison between Islanders and the colonial administration. The movement was especially popular with ex-Labour Corp members and after the war its numbers swelled, with the movement spreading to other islands. Alarmed at the growth of the movement, the British launched &quot;Operation De-Louse&quot; in 1947–8 and arrested most of the Maasina leaders. Malaitans then organised a campaign of civil disobedience, prompting mass arrests. In 1950 a new Resident Commissioner, Henry Gregory-Smith, arrived and released the leaders of the movement, though the disobedience campaign continued. In 1952 new High Commissioner (later Governor) Robert Stanley met with leaders of the movement and agreed to the creation of an island council. In late 1952 Stanley formally moved the capital of the territory to Honiara. In the early 1950s the possibility of transferring sovereignty of the islands to Australia was discussed by the British and Australian governments; however, the Australians were reluctant to accept the financial burden of administering the territory and the idea was shelved.

With decolonisation sweeping the colonial world, and Britain no longer willing (or able) to bear the financial burdens of the Empire, the colonial authorities sought to prepare the Solomons for self-governance. Appointed Executive and Legislative Councils were established in 1960, with a degree of elected Solomon Islander representation introduced in 1964 and then extended in 1967. A new constitution was drawn up in 1970 which merged the two Councils into one Governing Council, though the British Governor still retained extensive powers. Discontent with this prompted the creation of a new constitution in 1974 which reduced much of the Governor&#x27;s remaining powers and created the post of Chief Minister, first held by Solomon Mamaloni. Full self-government for the territory was achieved in 1976, a year after the independence of neighbouring Papua New Guinea from Australia. Meanwhile, discontent grew in the Western islands, with many fearing marginalisation in future a Honiara- or Malaita-dominated state, prompting the formation of the Western Breakaway Movement. A conference held in London in 1977 agreed that the Solomons would gain full independence the following year. Under the terms of the Solomon Islands Act 1978 the country was annexed to Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions and granted independence on 7 July 1978. The first prime minister was Sir Peter Kenilorea of the Solomon Islands United Party (SIUP), with Elizabeth II becoming Queen of Solomon Islands, represented locally by a Governor General.

===Independence era (1978–present)===
====Early post-independence years====
Peter Kenilorea went on to win the 1980 Solomon Islands general election, serving as PM until 1981, when he was replaced by Solomon Mamaloni of the People&#x27;s Alliance Party (PAP) after a no confidence vote. Mamaloni created the Central Bank and national airline, and pushed for greater autonomy for individual islands of the country. Kenilorea returned to power after winning the 1984 election, though his second term lasted only two years before he was replaced by Ezekiel Alebua following allegations of misuse of French aid money. In 1986 the Solomons helped found the Melanesian Spearhead Group, aimed at fostering cooperation and trade in the region. After winning the 1989 election Mamaloni and the PAP returned to power, with Mamaloni dominating Solomon Islands politics from the early to mid 1990s (save for the one year Premiership of Francis Billy Hilly). Mamaloni made efforts to make the Solomons a republic; however, these were unsuccessful. He also had to deal with the effects of the conflict in neighbouring Bougainville which broke out in 1988, causing many refugees to flee to the Solomons. Tensions arose with Papua New Guinea as PNG forces frequently entered Solomons territory in the pursuit of rebels. The situation calmed down and relations improved following the end of the conflict in 1998. Meanwhile, the country&#x27;s financial situation continued to deteriorate, with much of the budget coming from the logging industry, often conducted at an unsustainable rate, not helped by Mamaloni&#x27;s creation of a &#x27;discretionary fund&#x27; for use by politicians, which fostered fraud and corruption. Discontent with his rule led to a split in the PAP, and Mamaloni lost the 1993 election to Billy Hilly, though Hilly was later sacked by the Governor-General after a number of defections caused him to lose his majority, allowing Mamaloni to return to power in 1994, where he remained until 1997. Excessive logging, government corruption and unsustainable levels of public spending continued to grow, and public discontent caused Mamaloni to lose the 1997 election. The new prime minister, Bartholomew Ulufa&#x27;alu of the Solomon Islands Liberal Party, attempted to enact economic reforms; however, his premiership soon became engulfed in a serious ethnic conflict known as &quot;The Tensions&quot;.
====Ethnic violence (1998–2003)====

Commonly referred to as &quot;the tensions&quot; or &quot;the ethnic tension&quot;, the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM, also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and the Isatabu Freedom Fighters) and the Malaita Eagle Force (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). For many years people from the island of Malaita had been migrating to Honiara and Guadalcanal, attracted primarily by the greater economic opportunities available there. The large influx caused tensions with native Guadalcanal islanders (known as Guales), and in late 1998 the IFM was formed and began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. Thousands of Malaitans subsequently fled back to Malaita or to Honiara, and in mid-1999 the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established to protect Malaitans on Guadalcanal. In late 1999, after several failed attempts at brokering a peace deal, Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa&#x27;alu declared a four-month state of emergency, and also requested assistance from Australia and New Zealand, but his appeal was rejected. Meanwhile, law and order on Guadalcanal collapsed, with an ethnically divided police unable to assert authority and many of their weapons depots being raided by the militias; by this point the MEF controlled Honiara with the IFM controlling the rest of Guadalacanal.

In April 2003, seven Christian brothers – Brother Robin Lindsay and his companions – were killed on the Weather Coast of Guadalcanal by the rebel leader Harold Keke. Six had gone in search of their Brother Nathaniel, who it turns out had already been tortured and killed. During the tensions Nathaniel had befriended the militant group but Harold Keke accused him of being a government spy and he was beaten to death; it was reported that he died singing hymns. They are commemorated by the Anglican church on 24 April.

On 5 June 2000, Ulufa&#x27;alu was kidnapped by the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa&#x27;alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. Manasseh Sogavare, who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa&#x27;alu&#x27;s government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as prime minister by 23–21 over the Rev. Leslie Boseto. However, Sogavare&#x27;s election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote. On 15 October 2000, the Townsville Peace Agreement was signed by the MEF, elements of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the IFM, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, Harold Keke, refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te&#x27;e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the &#x27;Joint Operations Force&#x27;. During the next two years the conflict moved to the remote Weathercoast region of southern Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.
By early 2001, the economy had collapsed and the government was bankrupt. New elections in December 2001 brought Allan Kemakeza into the Prime Minister&#x27;s chair, with the support of his People&#x27;s Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast, whilst militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime, extortion and banditry. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister Laurie Chan resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. The atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help; the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.

In July 2003, Australian and Pacific Islands police and troops arrived in Solomon Islands under the auspices of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia and New Zealand, and with representatives from about 15 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under Operation Helpem Fren. The situation improved dramatically, with violence ending and Harold Keke surrendering to the force. Some 200 people had been killed in the conflict. Since this time, some commentators have considered the country a failed state, with the nation having failed to build an inclusive national identity capable of overriding local island and ethnic loyalties. However, other academics argue that, rather than being a &#x27;failed state&#x27;, it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence. Furthermore, some scholars, such Kabutaulaka (2001) and Dinnen (2002) argue that the &#x27;ethnic conflict&#x27; label is an oversimplification.

====Post-conflict era====

Kemakeza remained in office until April 2006, when he lost the 2006 Solomon Islands general election and Snyder Rini became PM. However, allegations that Rini had used bribes from Chinese businessmen to buy the votes of members of Parliament led to mass rioting in the capital Honiara, concentrated on the city&#x27;s Chinatown area. Resentment against the minority Chinese business community led to much of Chinatown in the city being destroyed. China sent chartered aircraft to evacuate Chinese out of the riots. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional Australian, New Zealand, and Fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected Manasseh Sogavare as prime minister.

Sogavare struggled to assert his authority and was also hostile to the Australian presence in the country; after one failed attempt, he was removed in a no confidence vote in 2007 and replaced by Derek Sikua of the Solomon Islands Liberal Party. In 2008, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to examine and help heal the wounds of the &#x27;tension&#x27; years. Sikua lost the 2010 Solomon Islands general election to Danny Philip, though after a vote of no-confidence in him following allegations of corruption, Philip was ousted and replaced by Gordon Darcy Lilo. Sogavare returned to power after the 2014 election, and oversaw the withdrawal of RAMSI forces from the country in 2017. Sogavare was ousted in a no-confidence vote in 2017, which saw Rick Houenipwela come to power; however, Sogavare returned to the prime ministership after winning the 2019 election, sparking rioting in Honiara. In 2019, Sogavare announced that the Solomons would be switching recognition from Taiwan to China.

On 25 November 2019, Solomon Islands launched a national ocean policy to achieve the sustainable development and use of the ocean for the benefit of the people of the island nation.

In November 2021, there was mass rioting and unrest. The Solomon Islands Government requested assistance from Australia under the 2017 Bilateral Security Treaty and Australia provided a deployment of Australian Federal Police and Defence Forces.

In March 2022, Solomon Islands signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on policing cooperation with China and was also reported to be in the process of concluding a security agreement with China. The agreement with China could allow an ongoing Chinese military and naval presence in the Solomons. A spokesperson for Australia&#x27;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said that, while &quot;Pacific Island nations have the right to make sovereign decisions&quot;, Australia &quot;would be concerned by any actions that destabilise the security of our region&quot;. There are similar concerns in New Zealand and the United States. China donated a shipment of replica firearms to the Solomon Islands police for training. Solomon Islands and China signed a security co-operation agreement in April to promote social stability and long-term peace and security in Solomon Islands. The BBC reported that, according to a leaked draft of the agreement verified by the Australian government, Beijing could deploy forces to Solomon Islands &quot;to assist in maintaining social order&quot;. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the pact would not &quot;undermine peace and harmony&quot; in the region and was aimed at protecting the Solomon&#x27;s internal security situation. China confirmed that the social-order clause had been maintained in the final agreement.

In February 2023, further protests broke out after the Premier of Malaita Province Daniel Suidani was removed from office after a vote of no confidence from the provincial legislature. In May 2024, Jeremiah Manele was elected as Solomon Islands new prime minister to succeed Manasseh Sogavare.

==Politics==


Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of government. As King of Solomon Islands, Charles III is head of state; he is represented by the Governor-General who is chosen by the Parliament for a five-year term. There is a unicameral parliament of 50 members, elected for four-year terms. However, Parliament may be dissolved by the majority vote of its members before the completion of its term.

Parliamentary representation is based on single-member constituencies. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 21. The head of government is the prime minister, who is elected by Parliament and chooses the cabinet. Each ministry is headed by a cabinet member, who is assisted by a permanent secretary, a career public servant who directs the staff of the ministry.

Land ownership is reserved for Solomon Islanders. The law provides that resident expatriates, such as the Chinese and Kiribati, may obtain citizenship through naturalisation. Land generally is still held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. The islanders are reluctant to provide land for nontraditional economic undertakings, and this has resulted in continual disputes over land ownership.

No military forces are maintained by the Solomon Islands (since 1978), although a police force of nearly 500 includes a border protection unit. The police are also responsible for fire service, disaster relief, and maritime surveillance. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the governor-general and responsible to the prime minister. On 27 December 2006, the Solomon Islands government took steps to prevent the country&#x27;s Australian police chief from returning to the Pacific nation. On 12 January 2007, Australia replaced its top diplomat expelled from Solomon Islands for political interference in a conciliatory move aimed at easing a four-month dispute between the two countries.

On 13 December 2007, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare was toppled by a vote of no confidence in Parliament, following the defection of five ministers to the opposition. It was the first time a prime minister had lost office in this way in Solomon Islands. On 20 December, the parliament elected the opposition&#x27;s candidate (and former Minister for Education) Derek Sikua as prime minister in a vote of 32 to 15. In April 2019, Manasseh Sogavare was elected as prime minister for the fourth time, causing protests and demonstrations against the decision. The protest resulted in more than 30 protesters being detained.

===Judiciary===

The Governor-General appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The Governor-General appoints the other justices with the advice of a judicial commission. The current Chief Justice is Sir Albert Palmer.

Since March 2014, Justice Edwin Goldsbrough has served as the President of the Court of Appeal for Solomon Islands. Justice Goldsbrough has previously served a five-year term as a Judge of the High Court of Solomon Islands (2006–2011). Justice Edwin Goldsbrough then served as the Chief Justice of the Turks and Caicos Islands.

===Foreign relations===
Solomon Islands is a member of the United Nations, Interpol, Commonwealth of Nations, Pacific Islands Forum, Pacific Community, International Monetary Fund, and the African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries (Lomé Convention).

Until September 2019, it was one of the few countries to recognise the Republic of China (Taiwan) and maintain formal diplomatic relations with it. The relationship was terminated in September 2019 by Solomon Islands, which switched recognition to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Relations with Papua New Guinea, which had become strained because of an influx of refugees from the Bougainville rebellion and attacks on the northern islands of Solomon Islands by elements pursuing Bougainvillean rebels, have been repaired. A 1998 peace accord on Bougainville removed the armed threat, and the two nations regularised border operations in a 2004 agreement. Since 2022, ties with China have been rapidly increasing, with Solomon Islands signing a security pact that allows the country to call for Chinese security forces to quell unrest.

In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Solomon Islands and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in the Western New Guinea, which claimed by International Parliamentarians for West Papua (IPWP) that West Papua has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963, and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report. Indonesia rejected Vanuatu&#x27;s allegations, replying that Vanuatu does not represent the people of Papua and it should &quot;stop fantasizing&quot; that it does. More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict. In September 2017, at the 72nd Session of the UN General Assembly, the Prime Ministers of Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu once again raised human rights abuses in Indonesian-occupied West Papua.

===Military===
Although the locally recruited British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force was part of Allied Forces taking part in fighting in the Solomons during the Second World War, the country has not had any regular military forces since independence. The various paramilitary elements of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) were disbanded and disarmed in 2003 following the intervention of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). RAMSI had a small military detachment headed by an Australian commander with responsibilities for assisting the police element of RAMSI in internal and external security. The RSIPF still operates two Pacific class patrol boats (RSIPV &quot;Auki&quot; and RSIPV &quot;Lata&quot;), which constitute the de facto navy of Solomon Islands.

In the long term, it is anticipated that the RSIPF will resume the defence role of the country. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the Governor-General and responsible to the Minister of Police, National Security &amp; Correctional Services.

The police budget of Solomon Islands has been strained due to a four-year civil war. Following Cyclone Zoe&#x27;s strike on the islands of Tikopia and Anuta in December 2002, Australia had to provide the Solomon Islands government with SI$200,000 () for fuel and supplies for the patrol boat &quot;Lata&quot; to sail with relief supplies. (Part of the work of RAMSI includes assisting the Solomon Islands government to stabilise its budget.)

===Administrative divisions===
For local government, the country is divided into ten administrative areas, of which nine are provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies and the tenth is the capital Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.


===Islands by province===
===Human rights===

There are human rights concerns and issues in regards to education, water/water security, sanitation, gender equality, and domestic violence, as well as others. The Solomon Islands does not have a national human rights institution that is compliant with the Paris Principles. Homosexuality is illegal in the Solomon Islands; it is punishable by up to 14 years of imprisonment.

==Geography==

Solomon Islands is an island nation that lies east of Papua New Guinea and consists of six major islands and 992 smaller islands. The major part of the nation of Solomon Islands covers many of the mountainous volcanic islands of the Solomon Islands archipelago, which includes Choiseul, the Shortland Islands, the New Georgia Islands, Santa Isabel, the Russell Islands, the Florida Islands, Tulagi, Malaita, Maramasike, Ulawa, Owaraha (Santa Ana), Makira (San Cristobal), and the main island of Guadalcanal. Solomon Islands also includes smaller, isolated low atolls and volcanic islands such as Sikaiana, Rennell Island, Bellona Island, the Santa Cruz Islands and tiny outliers such as Tikopia, Anuta, and Fatutaka. Although Bougainville is the largest island in the Solomon Islands archipelago it is politically an autonomous region of Papua New Guinea and does not form part of the nation of Solomon Islands.

The country&#x27;s islands lie between latitudes 5° and 13°S, and longitudes 155° and 169°E. The distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is . The Santa Cruz Islands (of which Tikopia is part) are situated north of Vanuatu and are especially isolated at more than from the other islands.

=== Climate ===

The islands&#x27; ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is the cooler period. Though seasons are not pronounced, the northwesterly winds of November through April bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones. The annual rainfall is about . According to the WorldRiskReport 2021, the island state ranks second among the countries with the highest disaster risk worldwide. The country is also one of the most vulnerable to global sea level rise from man-made climate change.

In 2023, the governments of Solomon Islands and other island states at risk from climate change (Fiji, Niue, Tuvalu, Tonga and Vanuatu) launched the &quot;Port Vila Call for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific&quot;, calling for the phaseout of fossil fuels and the &#x27;rapid and just transition&#x27; to renewable energy and strengthening environmental law including introducing the crime of ecocide.

=== Ecology ===
The Solomon Islands archipelago is part of two distinct terrestrial ecoregions. Most of the islands are part of the Solomon Islands rain forests ecoregion, which also includes the islands of Bougainville and Buka; these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities. The Santa Cruz Islands are part of the Vanuatu rain forests ecoregion, together with the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.19/10, ranking it 48th globally out of 172 countries. More than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers are found in Solomon Islands.

Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic (there are volcanoes with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands) to relatively infertile limestone. The islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes. The Tinakula and Kavachi volcanoes are the most active.

On the southern side of Vangunu Island, the forests around Zaira provided the habitat for at least three vulnerable species of animals. The 200 human inhabitants of the area have been trying to get the forests declared a protected area so that logging and mining cannot be performed.

The baseline survey of marine biodiversity in the Solomon Islands that was carried out in 2004, found 474 species of corals in the Solomons as well as nine species which could be new to science. It has the second highest diversity of corals in the world, second only to the Raja Ampat Islands in eastern Indonesia.

=== Water and sanitation ===

Scarcity of fresh water sources and lack of sanitation has been a constant challenge facing Solomon Islands. Reducing the number of those living without access to fresh water and sanitation by half was one of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) implemented by the United Nations through Goal 7, to ensure environmental sustainability. Though the islands generally have access to fresh water sources, it is typically only available in the state&#x27;s capital of Honiara, and it is not guaranteed all year long.

According to a UNICEF report, the capital&#x27;s poorest communities do not have access to adequate places to relieve their waste, and an estimated 70% Solomon Island schools have no access to safe and clean water for drinking, washing, and relieving of waste. Lack of safe drinking water in school-age children results in high risks of contracting fatal diseases such as cholera and typhoid. The number of Solomon Islanders living with piped drinking water has been decreasing since 2011, while those living with non-piped water increased between 2000 and 2010. Those living with non-piped water has been decreasing consistently since 2011.

In addition, the Solomon Islands Second Rural Development Program, enacted in 2014 and active until 2020, has been working to deliver infrastructure and other vital services to rural areas and villages of Solomon Islands. The program has also encouraged farmers and other agricultural sectors. Rural villages such as Bolava, found in the Western Province of Solomon Islands, have implemented rain catchment and water storage systems. The program is funded by various international development actors such as the World Bank, the European Union, and the Australian and Solomon Islands governments.

===Earthquakes===

On 2 April 2007 at 07:39:56 local time (UTC+11), an earthquake with magnitude 8.1 on the scale occurred at hypocentre S8.453 E156.957, northwest of the island&#x27;s capital, Honiara, and south-east of the capital of Western Province, Gizo, at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles). More than 44 aftershocks with magnitude 5.0 or greater occurred up until 22:00:00 UTC, 4 April 2007. A tsunami followed killing at least 52 people, destroying more than 900 homes and leaving thousands of people homeless. Land upthrust extended the shoreline of one island, Ranongga, by up to , exposing many coral reefs.

On 6 February 2013, an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0 occurred at epicentre S10.80 E165.11 in the Santa Cruz Islands followed by a tsunami up to 1.5 metres. At least nine people were killed and many houses demolished. The main quake was preceded by a sequence of earthquakes with a magnitude of up to 6.0.

==Economy==



The Solomon Islands&#x27; per-capita GDP of $600 ranks it as a least developed country, and more than 75% of its labour force is engaged in subsistence agriculture and fishing. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. Only 3.9% of the area of the islands is used for agriculture, and 78.1% are covered by forests, making the Solomon Islands the 103rd-ranked country to be covered by forests percentage-wise worldwide.

The Solomon Islands Government was insolvent by 2002. Since the RAMSI intervention in 2003, the government has recast its budget. Principal aid donors are Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan.

===Currency===

The Solomon Islands dollar (ISO 4217 code: &quot;SBD&quot;) was introduced in 1977, replacing the Australian dollar at par. Its symbol is &quot;SI$&quot;, but the &quot;SI&quot; prefix may be omitted if there is no confusion with other currencies also using the dollar sign, &quot;$&quot;. It is subdivided into 100 cents. Local shell money is still important for traditional and ceremonial purposes in certain provinces and, in some remote parts of the country, for trade. Shell money was a widely used traditional currency in the Pacific Islands; in Solomon Islands, it is mostly manufactured in Malaita and Guadalcanal but can be bought elsewhere, such as the Honiara Central Market. The barter system often replaces money of any kind in remote areas.

===Exports===

Until 1998, when world prices for tropical timber fell steeply, timber was Solomon Islands&#x27; main export product. In June 2000, exports of palm oil and gold ceased while exports of timber fell.

The Solomon Islands courts have re-approved the export of live dolphins for profit, most recently to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This practice was originally stopped by the government in 2004 after uproar over a shipment of 28 live dolphins to Mexico. The move resulted in criticism from both Australia and New Zealand as well as several conservation organisations. As of 2022, rough wood makes up two-thirds of the country&#x27;s exports, worth over ().

===Agriculture===

In 2017, 317,682 tons of coconuts were harvested, making the country the 18th ranked producer of coconuts worldwide; 24% of the exports corresponded to copra. Cocoa beans are mainly grown on the islands Guadalcanal, Makira, and Malaita. In 2017, 4,940 tons of cocoa beans were harvested, making the Solomon Islands the 27th ranked producer of cocoa worldwide. Growth of production and export of copra and cacao, however, is hampered by old age of most coconut and cacao trees. In 2017, 285,721 tons of palm oil were produced, making Solomon Islands the 24th ranked producer of palm oil worldwide. Other important cash crops and exports include copra, cacao, and palm oil.

For the local market but not for export, many families grow taro (2017: 45,901 tons), rice (2017: 2,789 tons), yams (2017: 44,940 tons), and bananas (2017: 313 tons). Tobacco (2017: 118 tons) and spices (2017: 217 tons) were also produced.
===Mining===

In 1998, gold mining began at Gold Ridge on Guadalcanal. Minerals exploration in other areas continued. The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold. Negotiations are underway that may lead to the eventual reopening of the Gold Ridge mine that was closed after the riots in 2006. Rennell Island bauxite mine operated from 2011 to 2021 on Rennell Island, leaving behind serious ecological damage after multiple spills.

===Fisheries===

Solomon Islands&#x27; fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion. A Japanese joint venture, Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country, closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has not resumed.

===Tourism===

In 2017, Solomon Islands was visited by 26,000 tourists making the country one of the least frequently-visited countries of the world. The Solomon Island government hoped to increase the number of tourists up to 30,000 by the end of 2019 and up to 60,000 tourists per year by the end of 2025. In 2019, the Solomon Islands were visited by 28,900 tourists and in 2020 by 4,400.

===Energy===

A team of renewable energy developers working for the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and funded by the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) have developed a scheme that allows local communities to access renewable energy, such as solar, water, and wind power, without the need to raise substantial sums of cash. Under the scheme, islanders who are unable to pay for solar lanterns in cash may pay instead in kind with crops.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Flight connections ===
Solomon Airlines connects Honiara International Airport to Nadi in Fiji, Port Vila in Vanuatu, and Brisbane in Australia as well as to more than 20 domestic airports in each province of the country. To promote tourism Solomon Airlines introduced a weekly direct flight connection between Brisbane and Munda in 2019. Virgin Australia connects Honiara to Brisbane twice a week. Most of the domestic airports are accessible to small planes only as they have short, grass runways.

=== Roads ===
The road system in Solomon Islands is insufficient and there are no railways. The most important roads connect Honiara to Lambi (58 km; 36 miles) in the western part of Guadalcanal and to Aola (75 km; 47 miles) in the eastern part. There are few buses and these do not circulate according to a fixed timetable. In Honiara, there is no bus terminus.

=== Ferries ===
Most of the islands can be reached by ferry from Honiara. There is a daily connection from Honiara to Auki via Tulagi by a high speed catamaran.

==Demographics==
The total population at the November 2019 census was 721,455. , there were  people in the Solomon Islands. The population is slightly skewed towards males, with there being around 370,000 males compared to 356,000 for females.

=== Ethnic groups ===
The majority of Solomon Islanders are ethnically Melanesian (95.3%). Polynesian (3.1%) and Micronesian (1.2%) are the two other significant groups. There are a few thousand Europeans and a similar number of ethnic Chinese.

=== Languages ===
While English is the official language, only 1–2% of the population are able to communicate fluently in English. However, an English creole, Solomons Pijin, is a &quot;de facto&quot; lingua franca of the country spoken by the majority of the population, along with local indigenous languages. Pijin is closely related to Tok Pisin spoken in Papua New Guinea.

The number of local languages listed for Solomon Islands is 74, of which 70 are living languages and 4 are extinct, according to &quot;Ethnologue, Languages of the World&quot;. Western Oceanic languages (predominantly of the Southeast Solomonic group) are spoken on the central islands. Polynesian languages are spoken on Rennell and Bellona to the south; Tikopia, Anuta, and Fatutaka to the far east; Sikaiana to the north east; and Luaniua (Ontong Java Atoll) to the north. The immigrant population from Kiribati (the i-Kiribati) speak Gilbertese.

Most of the indigenous languages are Austronesian languages. The Central Solomon languages such as Bilua, Lavukaleve, Savosavo, and Touo constitute an independent family within Papuan languages.

===Religion===

The religion of Solomon Islands is 92% Christian. The main Christian denominations are: Anglican 35%, Catholic 19%, the South Seas Evangelical Church 17%, the United Church 11%, and Seventh-day Adventist 10%. Other Christian denominations are the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, the New Apostolic Church (80 churches), and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Another 5% adhere to aboriginal beliefs. The remaining 3% adhere to Islam or the Baháʼí Faith. According to the most recent reports, Islam in Solomon Islands is made up of approximately 350 Muslims, including members of the Ahmadiyya Islamic community.

===Health===

In 2018, there were 59,191 confirmed cases of malaria infections, of which 59.3% (35,072) were &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; and 26.7% (15,771) &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;. A small-scale study had once reported a 20% case of &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; out of 296 women. In 2021, the top cause of deaths, according to the WHO, was ischaemic heart disease, followed by stroke and diabetes mellitus. Another prevalent case is the &quot;Zika virus&quot; and &quot;Dengue virus&quot;. Dengue fever in the country was first reported in 1982 in Honiara. A subsequent outbreak in 2013 resulted in its first reported deaths. Later, the Solomon Islands recorded its first &quot;Zika virus&quot; outbreak in 2015.

===Education===
Education in Solomon Islands is not compulsory, and only 60 percent of school-age children have access to primary education. There are kindergartens in various places, including the capital, but they are not free. The University of the South Pacific, which has campuses in 12 Pacific island nations, has a campus at Guadalcanal.

From 1990 to 1994, the gross primary school enrolment rose from 84.5 percent to 96.6 percent. Primary school attendance rates were unavailable for Solomon Islands as of 2001. The Department of Education and Human Resource Development had planned to expand educational facilities and increase enrolment rates. However, these actions have been hindered by a lack of government funding and poor coordination of programs. The percentage of the government&#x27;s budget allocated to education was 9.7 percent in 1998, down from 13.2 percent in 1990. Male educational attainment tends to be higher than female educational attainment. The literacy rate of the adult population amounted to 84.1% in 2015 (men 88.9%, women 79.23%).

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) finds that the Solomon Islands is fulfilling only 70.1% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country&#x27;s level of income. HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration the Solomon Islands&#x27; income level, the nation is achieving 94.9% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education but only 45.4% for secondary education.

==Culture==

The culture of the Solomon Islands is diverse among the groups living within the Solomon Islands archipelago, which lies within Melanesia in the Pacific Ocean, with the peoples distinguished by island, language, topography, and geography. The cultural area includes the nation-state of Solomon Islands and Bougainville Island, which is a part of Papua New Guinea. The Solomon Islands includes some culturally Polynesian societies that lie outside the main region of Polynesian influence, known as the Polynesian Triangle. There are seven Polynesian outliers within the Solomon Islands: Anuta, Bellona, Ontong Java, Rennell, Sikaiana, Tikopia, and Vaeakau-Taumako.

There are majority cultural concepts such as the &quot;Wantok&quot; concept of people with a common language who are blood relatives being part of the extended family support and expected to assist one another and the Pijin term &quot;Kastom&quot; for both traditional beliefs and traditional land ownership concepts.

Malaitan shell-money, manufactured in the Langa Langa Lagoon, is the traditional currency used in Malaita and throughout the Solomon Islands. The money consists of small polished shell disks which are drilled and placed on strings. In the Solomons &quot;Tectus niloticus&quot; is harvested, which was traditionally made into items such as pearl buttons and jewellery.

===Gender inequality and domestic violence===
Solomon Islands has one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence (FSV) in the world, with 64% of women aged 15–49 having reported physical and/or sexual abuse by a partner. As per a World Health Organization (WHO) report issued in 2011, &quot;the causes of Gender Based Violence (GBV) are multiple, but it primarily stems from gender inequality and its manifestations.&quot; The report stated:
:In Solomon Islands, GBV has been largely normalized: 73% of men and 73% of women believe violence against women is justifiable, especially for infidelity and &quot;disobedience,&quot; as when women do &quot;not live up to the gender roles that society imposes.&quot; For example, women who believed they could occasionally refuse sex were four times more likely to experience GBV from an intimate partner. Men cited acceptability of violence and gender inequality as two main reasons for GBV, and almost all of them reported hitting their female partners as a &quot;form of discipline,&quot; suggesting that women could improve the situation by &quot;[learning] to obey [them].&quot;

Another driver of gender inequality in Solomon Islands is the traditional practice of bride price. Although specific customs vary between communities, paying a bride price is considered similar to a property title, giving men ownership over women. Gender norms of masculinity tend to encourage men to &quot;control&quot; their wives, often through violence, while women felt that bride prices prevented them from leaving men. Another report issued by the WHO in 2013 reported that 64% of women aged 15–49 who had ever had an intimate partner had experienced some kind of violence by the partner. In 2014, Solomon Islands officially launched the Family Protection Act 2014, which was aimed at curbing domestic violence in the country.

===Literature===

Writers from Solomon Islands include the novelists John Saunana and Rexford Orotaloa and the poet Jully Makini.

===Media===
====Newspapers====

There is one daily newspaper, the &quot;Solomon Star&quot;; one daily online news website, &quot;Solomon Times Online&quot;; two weekly papers, &quot;Solomons Voice&quot; and &quot;Solomon Times&quot;; and two monthly papers, &quot;Agrikalsa Nius&quot; and the &quot;Citizen&#x27;s Press&quot;.

====Radio====
Radio is the most influential type of media in the Solomon Islands due to language differences, illiteracy, and the difficulty of receiving television signals in some parts of the country. The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC) operates public radio services, including the national stations Radio Happy Isles 1037 on the dial and Wantok FM 96.3, and the provincial stations Radio Happy Lagoon and, formerly, Radio Temotu. There are two commercial FM stations: Z FM at 99.5 in Honiara (but also receivable over a large majority of island out from Honiara) and PAOA FM at 97.7 in Honiara (also broadcasting on 107.5 in Auki), and one community FM radio station, Gold Ridge FM on 88.7.

====Television====

No television service covers the entire Solomon Islands, but some coverage is available in six main centres in four of the nine provinces. Satellite TV stations can be received. In Honiara, there is a free-to-air HD digital TV, analogue TV, and an online service called Telekom Television Limited, operated by Solomon Telekom Co. Ltd., which rebroadcasts a number of regional and international TV services, including ABC Australia and BBC World News. Residents can also subscribe to SATSOL, a digital paid TV service that can retransmit satellite television.

==== Others ====
There were approximately 229,500 internet users in the Solomon Islands at the start of 2022. Before that, the 2019 census reported that 225,945 people of age 12 years and above, the majority of whom came from Honiara, owned a mobile phone.

===Music===

Traditional Melanesian music in Solomon Islands includes both group and solo vocals, slit-drum and panpipe ensembles. Bamboo music gained a following in the 1920s. In the 1950s, Edwin Nanau Sitori composed the song &quot;Walkabout long Chinatown&quot;, which has been referred to by the government as the unofficial &quot;national song&quot; of the Solomon Islands. Modern Solomon Islander popular music includes various kinds of rock and reggae as well as &quot;island music&quot;.

===Sport===

The Solomon Islands national rugby union team has played internationals since 1969. It took part in the Oceania qualifying tournament for the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups, but did not qualify on either occasion.

The Solomon Islands national football team is part of the OFC confederation in FIFA. They are ranked 147th for the men and 86th for the women team out of 210 teams in the FIFA World Rankings in 2024. The team became the first team to beat New Zealand in qualifying for a play-off spot against Australia for qualification to the World Cup 2006. They were defeated 7–0 in Australia and 2–1 at home.

Closely related to Association Football. On 14 June 2008, the Solomon Islands national futsal team, the Kurukuru, won the Oceania Futsal Championship in Fiji to qualify them for the 2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup, which was held in Brazil from 30 September to 19 October 2008. Solomon Islands is the futsal defending champions in the Oceania region. In 2008 and 2009, the Kurukuru won the Oceania Futsal Championship in Fiji. In 2009, they defeated the host nation Fiji 8–0 to claim the title. The Kurukuru currently hold the world record for the fastest ever goal scored in an official futsal match. It was set by Kurukuru captain Elliot Ragomo, who scored against New Caledonia three seconds into the game in July 2009. They were beaten by Russia with two goals to thirty-one in 2008.

The Solomon Islands national beach soccer team, the Bilikiki Boys, have won all three regional championships to date, thereby qualifying on each occasion for the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. The Bilikiki Boys are ranked fourteenth in the world , higher than any other team from Oceania.

Solomon Islands hosted the 2023 Pacific Games.

<doc id="265084" wikidata="Q2188756" url="?curid=265084" title="History of the United States (1865–1917)">
<text>The history of the United States from 1865 to 1917 was marked by the Reconstruction era, the Gilded Age, and the Progressive Era, and includes the rise of industrialization and the resulting surge of immigration in the United States.

This period of rapid economic growth and soaring prosperity in the Northern United States and the Western United States saw the U.S. become the world&#x27;s dominant economic, industrial, and agricultural power. The average annual income (after inflation) of non-farm workers grew by 75% from 1865 to 1900, and then grew another 33% by 1918.

With a victory in 1865 over the Southern Confederate States in the Civil War, the United States became a united nation with a stronger national government. Reconstruction brought the end of legalized slavery plus citizenship for the former slaves, but their new-found political power was rolled back within a decade, and they became second-class citizens under a &quot;Jim Crow&quot; system of deeply pervasive segregation that would stand for the next 80–90 years. Politically, during the Third Party System and Fourth Party System the nation was mostly dominated by Republicans (except for two Democratic presidents). After 1900 and the assassination of President William McKinley, the Progressive Era brought political, business, and social reforms (e.g., new roles for and government expansion of education, higher status for women, a curtailment of corporate excesses, and modernization of many areas of government and society). The Progressives worked through new middle-class organizations to fight against the corruption and behind-the-scenes power of entrenched, state political party organizations and big-city &quot;machines&quot;. They demanded—and won—women&#x27;s right to vote, and the nationwide prohibition of alcohol 1920–1933.

In an unprecedented wave of European immigration, 27.5 million new arrivals between 1865 and 1918 provided the labor base necessary for the expansion of industry and agriculture, as well as the population base for most of fast-growing urban America.

By the late nineteenth century, the United States had become a leading global industrial power, building on new technologies (such as the telegraph and steel), an expanding railroad network, and abundant natural resources such as coal, timber, oil, and farmland, to usher in the Second Industrial Revolution.

It was also during this period that the United States began to emerge as a global superpower. The U.S. easily defeated Spain in 1898, which unexpectedly brought a small empire. Cuba quickly was given independence, and the Philippines eventually became independent in 1946. Puerto Rico (and some smaller islands) became permanent U.S. territories, as did Alaska (added by purchase in 1867). The independent Republic of Hawaii was annexed by the U.S. as a territory in 1898.

==Reconstruction era==

Reconstruction was the period from 1863 to 1877, in which the federal government temporarily took control—one by one—of the Southern states of the Confederacy. Before his assassination in April 1865, President Abraham Lincoln had announced moderate plans for reconstruction to re-integrate the former Confederates as fast as possible. Lincoln set up the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau in March 1865, to aid former enslaved people in finding education, health care, and employment. The final abolition of slavery was achieved by the Thirteenth Amendment, ratified in December 1865. However, Lincoln was opposed by the Radical Republicans within his own party who feared that the former Confederates would never truly give up on slavery and Confederate nationalism, and would always try to reinstate them behind-the-scenes. As a result, the Radical Republicans tried to impose legal restrictions that would strip most ex-rebels&#x27; rights to vote and hold elected office. The Radicals were opposed by Lincoln&#x27;s vice president and successor, Tennessee Democrat Andrew Johnson. However, the Radicals won the critical elections of 1866, winning enough seats in Congress to override President Johnson&#x27;s vetoes of such legislation. They even successfully impeached President Johnson (in the House of Representatives), and almost removed him from office (in the Senate) in 1868. Meanwhile, they gave the South&#x27;s &quot;freedmen&quot; new constitutional and federal legal protections.

The Radicals&#x27; reconstruction plans took effect in 1867 under the supervision of the U.S. Army, allowing a Republican coalition of Freedmen, sympathetic local whites, and recent arrivals from the North to take control of Southern state governments. They ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, giving enormous new powers to the federal courts to deal with justice at the state level. These state governments borrowed heavily to build railroads and public schools, increasing taxation rates. The backlash of increasingly fierce opposition to these policies drove most of the sympathetic local whites out of the Republican Party and into the Democratic Party. President Ulysses S. Grant enforced civil rights protections for African-Americans that were being challenged in South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana. The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870 giving African-Americans the right to vote in American elections.

U.S. Representative Thaddeus Stevens was one of the major policymakers regarding Reconstruction, and obtained a House vote of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson. Hans Trefousse, his leading biographer, concludes that Stevens &quot;was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress. [He dominated] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail.&quot;

Reconstruction ended at different times in each state, the last in 1877, when Republican Rutherford B. Hayes won the contentious presidential election of 1876 over his opponent, Samuel J. Tilden. To deal with disputed electoral votes, Congress set up an Electoral Commission. It awarded the disputed votes to Hayes. The white South accepted the &quot;Compromise of 1877&quot; knowing that Hayes proposed to end Army control over the remaining three state governments in Republican hands. White Northerners accepted that the Civil War was over and that Southern whites posed no threat to the nation.

The end of Reconstruction marked the end of the brief period of civil rights and civil liberties for African Americans in the South, where most lived. Reconstruction caused permanent resentment, distrust, and cynicism among white Southerners toward the federal government, and helped create the &quot;Solid South,&quot; which typically voted for the (then-)socially conservative Democrats for all local, state, and national offices. White supremacists created a segregated society through &quot;Jim Crow Laws&quot; that made blacks second-class citizens with very little political power or public voice. The white elites (called the &quot;Redeemers&quot;—the southern wing of the &quot;Bourbon Democrats&quot;) were in firm political and economic control of the south until the rise of the Populist movement in the 1890s. Local law enforcement was weak in rural areas, allowing outraged mobs to use lynching to redress alleged-but-often-unproven crimes charged to blacks.

Historians&#x27; interpretations of the Radical Republicans have dramatically shifted over the years, from the pre-1950 view of them as tools of big business motivated by partisanship and hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded their efforts to give equal rights to the freed slaves.

In the South itself the interpretation of the tumultuous 1860s differed sharply by race. Americans often interpreted great events in religious terms. Historian Wilson Fallin contrasts the interpretation of Civil War and Reconstruction in white versus black using Baptist sermons in Alabama. White preachers expressed the view that:
: God had chastised them and given them a special mission – to maintain orthodoxy, strict Biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations. Slavery, they insisted, had not been sinful. Rather, emancipation was a historical tragedy and the end of Reconstruction was a clear sign of God&#x27;s favor.
In sharp contrast, Black preachers interpreted the Civil War, emancipation and Reconstruction as:
: God&#x27;s gift of freedom. They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help them; God would be their rock in a stormy land.

Historians in the 21st century typically consider Reconstruction to be a failure, but they &quot;disagree on what caused Reconstruction to fail, focusing on whether it went too far, too fast or did not go far enough.&quot;

However, historian Mark Summers in 2014 sees a positive outcome:
:if we see Reconstruction&#x27;s purpose as making sure that the main goals of the war would be filled, of a Union held together forever, of a North and South able to work together, of slavery extirpated, and sectional rivalries confined, of a permanent banishment of the fear of vaunting appeals to state sovereignty, backed by armed force, then Reconstruction looks like what in that respect it was, a lasting and unappreciated success.

==The West==

In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad opened up the far west mining and ranching regions. Travel from New York to San Francisco now took six days instead of six months. After the Civil War, many from the East Coast and Europe were lured west by reports from relatives and by extensive advertising campaigns promising &quot;the Best Prairie Lands&quot;, &quot;Low Prices&quot;, &quot;Large Discounts For Cash&quot;, and &quot;Better Terms Than Ever!&quot;. The new railroads provided the opportunity for migrants to go out and take a look, with special family tickets, the cost of which could be applied to land purchases offered by the railroads. Farming the plains was indeed more difficult than back east. Water management was more critical, lightning fires were more prevalent, the weather was more extreme, rainfall was less predictable. The fearful stayed home. The actual migrants looked beyond fears of the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to find a better economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesmen sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. With the Homestead Act of 1862 providing free land to citizens and the railroads selling cheap lands to European farmers, the settlement of the Great Plains was swiftly accomplished, and the frontier had virtually ended by 1890.

===American Indian assimilation===
Expansion into the plains and mountains by miners, ranchers and most of settlers led to conflict with some of the regional American Indian tribes. The government insisted the American Indians either move into the general society and become assimilated, or remain on assigned reservations. State and territorial militias used force to keep those choosing reservation life from threatening nearby tribes or settlers. The violence petered out in the 1880s and practically ceased after 1890. By 1880 the buffalo herds, a foundation for the hunting economy, had disappeared.

American Indians had the choice of living on reservations. The US government provided food, supplies, education and medical care. Individuals could move out on their own in Western society and earning wages, typically on a ranch. Reformers wanted to give as many American Indians as possible the opportunity to own and operate their own farms and ranches, and the issue was how to give individual Indians land owned by the tribe. To assimilate the Indians into American society, reformers set up training programs and schools, such as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, that produced many prominent Indian leaders. The anti-assimilation traditionalists on the reservations, however, resisted integration. The reformers decided the solution was to allow Indians still on reservations to own land as individuals.

The Dawes Act of 1887 was an effort to integrate American Indians into the mainstream; the majority accepted integration and were absorbed into American society, leaving a trace of American Indian ancestry in millions of American families. Those who refused to assimilate remained in poverty on the reservations, supported by Federal food, medicine and schooling. In 1934, U.S. policy was reversed again by the Indian Reorganization Act which attempted to protect tribal and communal life on the reservations.

===Farming===


A dramatic expansion in farming took place. The number of farms tripled from 2.0 million in 1860 to 6.0 million in 1905. The number of people living on farms grew from about 10 million in 1860 to 22 million in 1880 to 31 million in 1905. The value of farms soared from $8.0 billion in 1860 to $30 billion in 1906.

The federal government issued tracts virtually free to settlers under the Homestead Act of 1862. Even larger numbers purchased lands at very low interest from the new railroads, which were trying to create markets. The railroads advertised heavily in Europe and brought over, at low fares, hundreds of thousands of farmers from Germany, Scandinavia and Britain.

Despite their remarkable progress and general prosperity, 19th-century U.S. farmers experienced recurring cycles of hardship, caused primarily by falling world prices for cotton and wheat.

Along with the mechanical improvements which greatly increased yield per unit area, the amount of land under cultivation grew rapidly throughout the second half of the century, as the railroads opened up new areas of the West for settlement. The wheat farmers enjoyed abundant output and good years from 1876 to 1881 when bad European harvests kept the world price high. They then suffered from a slump in the 1880s when conditions in Europe improved. The farther west the settlers went, the more dependent they became on the monopolistic railroads to move their goods to market, and the more inclined they were to protest, as in the Populist movement of the 1890s. Wheat farmers blamed local grain elevator owners (who purchased their crop), railroads and eastern bankers for the low prices.

The first organized effort to address general agricultural problems was the Grange movement that reached out to farmers. It grew to 20,000 chapters and 1.6 million members. The Granges set up their own marketing systems, stores, processing plants, factories and cooperatives. Most went bankrupt. The movement also enjoyed some political success during the 1870s. A few Midwestern states passed &quot;Granger Laws&quot;, limiting railroad and warehouse fees.

===Family life===
Few single men attempted to operate a farm; farmers clearly understood the need for a hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands. During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After a generation or so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. This was further supported by the scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools.

Although the eastern image of farm life on the prairies emphasizes the isolation of the lonely farmer and farm life, in reality rural folk created a rich social life for themselves. For example, many joined a local branch of the Grange; a majority had ties to local churches. It was popular to organize activities that combined practical work, abundant food, and simple entertainment such as barn raisings, corn huskings, and quilting bees. One could keep busy with scheduled Grange meetings, church services, and school functions. The womenfolk organized shared meals and potluck events, as well as extended visits between families.

Childhood on the American frontier is contested territory. One group of scholars argues the rural environment was salubrious for it allowed children to break loose from urban hierarchies of age and gender, promoted family interdependence, and in the end produced children who were more self-reliant, mobile, adaptable, responsible, independent and more in touch with nature than their urban or eastern counterparts. However other historians offer a grim portrait of loneliness, privation, abuse, and demanding physical labor from an early age.

==Industrialization==

From 1865 to about 1913, the U.S. grew to become the world&#x27;s leading industrial nation. Land and labor, the diversity of climate, the ample presence of railroads (as well as navigable rivers), and the natural resources all fostered the cheap extraction of energy, fast transport, and the availability of capital that powered this Second Industrial Revolution. The average annual income (after inflation) of non-farm workers grew by 75% from 1865 to 1900, and then grew another 33% by 1918.

Where the First Industrial Revolution shifted production from artisans to factories, the Second Industrial Revolution pioneered an expansion in organization, coordination, and the scale of industry, spurred on by technology and transportation advancements. Railroads opened the West, creating farms, towns, and markets where none had existed. The first transcontinental railroad, built by nationally oriented entrepreneurs with British money and Irish and Chinese labor, provided access to previously remote expanses of land. Railway construction boosted opportunities for capital, credit, and would-be farmers.

New technologies in iron and steel manufacturing, such as the Bessemer process and open-hearth furnace, combined with similar innovations in chemistry and other sciences to vastly improve productivity. New communication tools, such as the telegraph and telephone allowed corporate managers to coordinate across great distances. Innovations also occurred in how work was organized, typified by Frederick Winslow Taylor&#x27;s ideas of scientific management.

To finance the larger-scale enterprises required during this era, the corporation emerged as the dominant form of business organization. Corporations expanded by merging, creating single firms out of competing firms known as &quot;trusts&quot; (a form of monopoly). High tariffs sheltered U.S. factories and workers from foreign competition, especially in the woolen industry. Federal railroad land grants enriched investors, farmers and railroad workers, and created hundreds of towns and cities. Business often went to court to stop labor from organizing into unions or from organizing strikes.

The nation&#x27;s industrial base remained firmly rooted in the Northeast and Midwestern states. The South benefited less and remained poor, rural, and backward, although the abolition of slavery and the breakup of large plantations after the Civil War had a leveling effect and reduced the wealth inequality that had become a serious problem in the late antebellum period--during the postwar years it became possible for many lower class Southerners to own land for the first time. The South did not attract immigration outside New Orleans due to its lack of major port cities and the ethnic makeup of the non-black population remained primarily Anglo-Irish with small communities of Jews, French Huguenots, and Germans. Some Southerners felt keenly aware of their backwardness and believed the South ought to compete with Northern industry--one Atlanta newspaper editor in the 1880s wrote &quot;A Confederate army veteran died. He was buried in a Yankee suit in a Yankee coffin in a hole dug with a Yankee shovel. The only things the South furnished were the hole and the corpse.&quot; Attempts at trying to set up industry in the South met with only modest success as the region lacked investment money and Northern financiers were content to keep the place as a source of raw materials for Northern factories. The sweltering summer weather of the region also discouraged industrial activity. The most successful Southern industrial venture by far was textiles which benefited from low labor costs and right to work laws forbidding workers from unionizing.

Powerful industrialists, such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and Jay Gould, known collectively by their critics as &quot;robber barons&quot;, held great wealth and power, so much so that in 1888 Rutherford B. Hayes noted in his diary that the United States ceased being a government for the people and had been replaced by a &quot;government of the corporation, by the corporation, and for the corporation.&quot; Critics in this period also bemoaned the disappearance of great political minds in America--the age of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Henry Clay was gone and the nation&#x27;s best and brightest gravitated to industry rather than government or politics. In a context of cutthroat competition for wealth accumulation, the skilled labor of artisans gave way to well-paid skilled workers and engineers, as the nation deepened its technological base. Meanwhile, a steady stream of immigrants encouraged the availability of cheap labor, especially in mining and manufacturing.

===Labor and management===
In the fast-growing industrial sector, wages were about double the level in Europe, but the work was harder with less leisure. Economic depressions swept the nation in 1873–75 and 1893–97, with low prices for farm goods and heavy unemployment in factories and mines. Full prosperity returned in 1897 and continued (with minor dips) to 1920.

The pool of unskilled labor was constantly growing, as unprecedented numbers of immigrants—27.5 million between 1865 and 1918 —entered the U.S. Most were young men eager for work. The rapid growth of engineering and the need to master the new technology created a heavy demand for engineers, technicians, and skilled workers. Before 1874, when Massachusetts passed the nation&#x27;s first legislation limiting the number of hours women and child factory workers could perform to 10 hours a day, virtually no labor legislation existed in the country. Child labor reached a peak around 1900 and then declined (except in Southern textile mills) as compulsory education laws kept children in school. It was finally ended in the 1930s.

===Labor organization===
The first major effort to organize workers&#x27; groups on a nationwide basis appeared with The Noble Order of the Knights of Labor in 1869. Originally a secret, ritualistic society organized by Philadelphia garment workers, it was open to all workers, including African Americans, women, and farmers. The Knights grew slowly until they succeeded in facing down the great railroad baron, Jay Gould, in an 1885 strike. Within a year, they added 500,000 workers to their rolls, far more than the thin leadership structure of the Knights could handle.

The Knights of Labor soon fell into decline, and their place in the labor movement was gradually taken by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Rather than open its membership to all, the AFL, under former cigar-makers union official Samuel Gompers, focused on skilled workers. His objectives were &quot;pure and simple&quot;: increasing wages, reducing hours, and improving working conditions. As such, Gompers helped turn the labor movement away from the socialist views earlier labor leaders had espoused. The AFL would gradually become a respected organization in the U.S., although it would have nothing to do with unskilled laborers.

In times of economic depression, layoffs and wage cuts angered workers, leading to violent labor conflicts in 1877 and 1894. In the Great Railroad Strike in 1877, railroad workers across the nation went on strike in response to a 10-percent pay cut. Attempts to break the strike led to bloody uprisings in several cities. The Haymarket Riot took place in 1886, when an anarchist allegedly threw a bomb that killed several police dispersing a strike rally at the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in Chicago. Anarchists were arrested and convicted, weakening the movement.

In commemoration of the Haymarket Riots, May 1 would be acknowledged by socialist and communist movements worldwide as International Workers&#x27; Day, Labor Day, or May Day, and became an official holiday in many countries. In 1893, President Cleveland signed into law a bill making Labor Day an official US holiday, but on the first weekend of September to avoid the socialistic connotations of May Day.

At its peak, the Knights claimed 700,000 members. By 1890, membership had plummeted to fewer than 100,000, then faded away. The killing of policemen greatly embarrassed the Knights of Labor, which was not involved with the bomb but which took much of the blame.

In the riots of 1892 at Carnegie&#x27;s steel works in Homestead, Pennsylvania, a group of 300 Pinkerton detectives, whom the company had hired to break a bitter strike by the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers, were fired upon by strikers and 10 were killed. As a result, the National Guard was called in to guard the plant; non-union workers were hired and the strike broken. The Homestead plant completely barred unions until 1937.

Two years later, wage cuts at the Pullman Palace Car Company, just outside Chicago, led to a strike, which, with the support of the American Railway Union, soon brought the nation&#x27;s railway industry to a halt. The shutdown of rail traffic meant the virtual shutdown of the entire national economy, and President Grover Cleveland acted vigorously. He secured injunctions in federal court, which Eugene Debs and the other strike leaders ignored. Cleveland then sent in the Army to stop the rioting and get the trains moving. The strike collapsed, as did the ARU, and Debs, a once middle-of-the-road social reformer, converted to a full-blown socialist while serving a sentence in Federal prison for defying a court order to cease striking.
The most militant working class organization of the 1905–1920 era was the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), formed largely in response to abysmal labor conditions (in 1904, the year before its founding, 27,000 workers were killed on the job) and discrimination against women, minorities, and unskilled laborers by other unions, particularly the AFL. The &quot;Wobblies,&quot; as they were commonly known, gained particular prominence from their incendiary and revolutionary rhetoric. Openly calling for class warfare, direct action, workplace democracy and &quot;One Big Union&quot; for all workers regardless of sex, race or skills, the Wobblies gained many adherents after they won a difficult 1912 textile strike (commonly known as the &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; strike) in Lawrence, Massachusetts. They proved ineffective in managing peaceful labor relations and members dropped away, primarily because the union failed to build long-term worker organizations even after a successful campaign, leaving the workers involved at the mercy of employers once the IWW had moved on. However, this was not fatal to the union. That the IWW directly challenged capitalism via direct action at the point of production prompted swift and decisive action from the state, especially during and after World War I. According to historian Howard Zinn, &quot;the IWW became a threat to the capitalist class, exactly when capitalist growth was enormous and profits huge.&quot; The IWW strongly opposed the 1917–18 war effort and faced a campaign of repression from the federal government. More than a few Wobblies, such as Frank Little, were beaten or lynched by mobs or died in American jails.

==Gilded Age==

The &quot;Gilded Age&quot; that was enjoyed by the topmost percentiles of American society after the recovery from the Panic of 1873 floated on the surface of the newly industrialized economy of the Second Industrial Revolution. It was further fueled by a period of wealth transfer that catalyzed dramatic social changes. It created for the first time a class of the super-rich &quot;captains of industry&quot;, the &quot;robber barons&quot; whose network of business, social and family connections ruled a largely White Anglo-Saxon Protestant social world that possessed clearly defined boundaries. The term &quot;Gilded Age&quot; was coined by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner in their 1873 book, &quot;The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today&quot;, employing the ironic difference between a &quot;gilded&quot; and a Golden Age.

Politically, the Republican Party was in ascendancy and would largely remain so until the 1930s with brief interruptions. The Civil War had collapsed the Democrats&#x27; national machine and given the GOP the chance to entrench its own national machine that held for 70 years. Republicans fully took credit for winning the war and abolishing slavery, and were firmly established as the party of big business, the gold standard, and economic protectionism. Republican voter strength came mostly out of the small and medium sized towns and rural areas of the Northeast and Midwest, as well as the majority of Union army veterans--the Grand Army of the Republic, a veterans&#x27; fraternal organization that wielded huge political power in the 1880s-1890s, was also referred to as &quot;Generally All Republicans.&quot; The addition of new states in the West gave the GOP still more national strength.

Democrats in the North were mostly an urban party that relied on immigrant laborers for a base, however in the Gilded Age there was not a major ideological gap between the two parties outside tariffs versus free trade. In the South, the end of Reconstruction quickly established the Democrat Party&#x27;s absolute rule over the region that held for a century. Only small pockets of Republican support existed in the South once black voter suppression was complete by the 1890s--usually these consisted of counties that had not supported secession during the war. German-Americans provided a small but stable Republican presence in a few areas of Texas and Eastern Tennessee remained a largely Republican area.

Nonetheless, national elections in the Gilded Age were close, contentious, and attracted a lot of energy and voter enthusiasm. This began to change after William McKinley&#x27;s victory in 1896. For 17 years afterward, the country came close to a one party Republican state and there were periods when Democrats were nearly reduced to a regional Southern party. Voter turnout and enthusiasm sharply fell off.

With the end of Reconstruction, there were few major political issues at stake and the 1880 presidential election was the quietest in a long time. James Garfield, the Republican candidate, won a very close election, but a few months into his administration was shot by a disgruntled public office seeker. Garfield was succeeded by Vice President Chester Arthur.

Reformers, especially the &quot;Mugwumps&quot; complained that powerful parties made for corruption during the Gilded Age or &quot;Third Party System&quot;. Voter enthusiasm and turnout during the period 1872–1892 was very high, often reaching practically all men. The major issues involved modernization, money, railroads, corruption, and prohibition. National elections, and many state elections, were very close. The 1884 presidential election saw a mudslinging campaign in which Republican James G. Blaine was defeated by Democrat Grover Cleveland, a reformer. During Cleveland&#x27;s presidency, he pushed to have Congress cut tariff duties. He also expanded civil services and vetoed many private pension bills. Many people were worried that these issues would hurt his chances in the 1888 election. When they expressed these concerns to Cleveland, he said &quot;What is the use of being elected or reelected, unless you stand for something?&quot; As was typical of the age, Cleveland took a conservative, constrained view of the Constitution and Federal powers. When the Texas port of Indianola was flattened by a devastating 1886 hurricane, he declined to give Federal relief funds for the town as he believed the Constitution did not grant him any such authority. &quot;Although the people should support the government, the government should not support the people,&quot; Cleveland said.

The dominant social class of the Northeast possessed the confidence to proclaim an &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, which could be identified in the rush of new public institutions that marked the period—hospitals, museums, colleges, opera houses, libraries, orchestras— and by the Beaux-Arts architectural idiom in which they splendidly stood forth, after Chicago hosted the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893.

==Social history==
Urbanization (the rapid growth of cities) went hand in hand with industrialization (the growth of factories and railroads), as well as expansion of farming. The rapid growth was made possible by high levels of immigration.

===Immigration===

From 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented and diverse stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, 27.5 million in total. In all, 24.4 million (89%) came from Europe, including 2.9 million from Great Britain, 2.2 million from Ireland, 2.1 million from Scandinavia, 3.8 million from Germany, 4.1 million from Italy, 7.8 million from Russia and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Another 1.7 million came from Canada. Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892, through the immigration station on Ellis Island, but various ethnic groups settled in different locations. New York and other large cities of the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest, obtaining jobs in industry and mining. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.
Immigrants were pushed out of their homelands by poverty or religious threats, and pulled to America by jobs, farmland and kin connections. They found economic opportunity at factories, mines and construction sites, and found farm opportunities in the Plains states.

While most immigrants were welcomed, Asians were not. Many Chinese had been brought to the west coast to construct railroads, but unlike European immigrants, they were seen as being part of an entirely alien culture. After intense anti-Chinese agitation in California and the west, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. An informal agreement in 1907, the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement, stopped Japanese immigration.

Some immigrants stayed temporarily in the U.S. then returned home, often with savings that made them relatively prosperous. Most, however, permanently left their native lands and stayed in hope of finding a better life in the New World. This desire for freedom and prosperity led to the famous term, the American Dream.

===Religion===
The Third Great Awakening was a period of renewal in Evangelical Protestantism from the late 1850s to the 1900s. It affected pietistic Protestant denominations and had a strong sense of social activism. It gathered strength from the postmillennial theology that the Second Coming of Christ would come after mankind had reformed the entire earth. A major component was the Social Gospel Movement, which applied Christianity to social issues and gained its force from the Awakening, as did the worldwide missionary movement. New groupings emerged, such as the Holiness movement and Nazarene movements, and Christian Science.

At the same time, the Catholic Church grew rapidly, with a base in the German, Irish, Polish, and Italian immigrant communities, and a leadership drawn from the Irish. The Catholics were largely working class and concentrated in the industrial cities and mining towns, where they built churches, parochial schools, and charitable institutions, as well as colleges. Catholic clergy in the United States were generally young, energetic, and had progressive ideas; they stood in sharp contrast to the stagnant, embattled, and reactionary Catholic Church in Europe.

The Jewish community grew rapidly, largely from immigrants fleeing anti-Semitic pogroms in Russia and Austria-Hungary. Settling primarily in and around New York City, these new Jewish Americans avoided the Reform synagogues of the older German Jews and instead formed Orthodox and Conservative synagogues.

===Nadir of race relations===

Even before Reconstruction was officially concluded in 1877, the Supreme Court made a series of rulings curbing the 14th Amendment. Federal attempts at enforcing civil rights essentially ceased until the 1950s.

In the 1896 case &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively upheld the Jim Crow system of racial segregation by its &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine.

The 1880s marked the beginning of the lynching epidemic. More than 4,000 lynchings are documented across the United States from the 1880s to the 1930s. They occurred in all regions of the country aside from New England, but were primarily centered in the South and West. While in the Southern states most lynching victims were black, in the West they were usually Native Americans, Chinese, or Mexicans. Although uncommon, there were occasional lynchings of whites as well. Lynchings of blacks not infrequently involved mutilations, burning, and torture. State and local officials often condemned mob violence but the perpetrators were seldom brought to justice even when their identities were known.

Blacks accused of crimes often fared poorly in the courtrooms of Southern states as well. Juries were entirely white and liable to sentence black defendants to death at a higher rate than their white counterparts. A longtime injustice cited by civil rights organizations was the widespread execution of black men for non-homicidal rape--a number of states in this time had rape as a capital crime which theoretically applied to all citizens but critics pointed out that most convictions involved a black man accused of an attack on a white female and called it a form of legal lynching. However, these executions continued as late as the 1950s-60s until the Supreme Court in the 1970s limited capital punishment in the United States to strictly first degree murder. Blacks were also heavily used by state prisons and local jails in the South as gang labor on chain gangs.

D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), the first great American film, made heroes of the Ku Klux Klan in Reconstruction.

===Populism===
By 1880, the Granger movement began to decline and was replaced by the Farmers&#x27; Alliance. From the beginning, the Farmers&#x27; Alliance were political organizations with elaborate economic programs. According to one early platform, its purpose was to &quot;unite the farmers of America for their protection against class legislation and the encroachments of concentrated capital.&quot; Their program also called for the regulation—if not the outright nationalization—of the railroads; currency inflation to provide debt relief; the lowering of the tariff; and the establishment of government-owned storehouses and low-interest lending facilities. These were known as the Ocala Demands.

During the late 1880s, a series of droughts devastated the West. Western Kansas lost half its population during a four-year span. By 1890, the level of agrarian distress was at an all-time high. Mary Elizabeth Lease, a noted populist writer and agitator, told farmers that they needed to &quot;raise less corn and more hell&quot;. Working with sympathetic Democrats in the South and small third parties in the West, the Farmers&#x27; Alliance made a push for political power. From these elements, a new political party, known as the Populist Party, emerged. The elections of 1890 brought the new party into coalitions that controlled parts of state government in a dozen Southern and Western states and sent a score of Populist senators and representatives to Congress.

Its first convention was in 1892, when delegates from farm, labor and reform organizations met in Omaha, Nebraska, determined at last to make their mark on a U.S. political system that they viewed as hopelessly corrupted by the monied interests of the industrial and commercial trusts.

The pragmatic portion of the Populist platform focused on issues of land, railroads and money, including the unlimited coinage of silver. The Populists showed impressive strength in the West and South in the 1892 elections, and their candidate for president, James B. Weaver, polled more than a million votes. It was the currency question, however, pitting advocates of silver against those who favored gold, that soon overshadowed all other issues. Agrarian spokesmen in the West and South demanded a return to the unlimited coinage of silver. Convinced that their troubles stemmed from a shortage of money in circulation, they argued that increasing the volume of money would indirectly raise prices for farm products and drive up industrial wages, thus allowing debts to be paid with inflated dollars.

Conservative groups and the financial classes, on the other hand, believed that such a policy would be disastrous, and they insisted that inflation, once begun, could not be stopped. Railroad bonds, the most important financial instrument of the time, were payable in gold. If fares and freight rates were set in half-price silver dollars, railroads would go bankrupt in weeks, throwing hundreds of thousands of men out of work and destroying the industrial economy. Only the gold standard, they said, offered stability.

The financial Panic of 1893 heightened the tension of this debate. Bank failures abounded in the South and Midwest; unemployment soared and crop prices fell badly. The crisis, and President Cleveland&#x27;s inability to solve it, nearly broke the Democratic Party.

The Democratic Party, which supported silver and free trade, absorbed the remnants of the Populist movement as the presidential elections of 1896 neared. The Democratic convention that year was witness to one of the most famous speeches in U.S. political history. Pleading with the convention not to &quot;crucify mankind on a cross of gold&quot;, William Jennings Bryan, the young Nebraskan champion of silver, won the Democrats&#x27; presidential nomination. The remaining Populists also endorsed Bryan, hoping to retain some influence by having a voice inside the Bryan movement. Despite carrying the South and all the West except California and Oregon, Bryan lost the more populated, industrial North and East—and the election—to the Republican William McKinley with his campaign slogan &quot;A Full Dinner Pail&quot;.

In 1897, the economy began to improve, mostly from restored business confidence. Silverites—who did not realize that most transactions were handled by bank checks, not sacks of gold—believed the new prosperity was spurred by the discovery of gold in the Yukon. In 1898, the Spanish–American War drew the nation&#x27;s attention further away from Populist issues. If the movement was dead, however, its ideas were not. Once the Populists supported an idea, it became so tainted that the vast majority of American politicians rejected it; only years later, after the taint had been forgotten, was it possible to achieve Populist reforms, such as the direct popular election of Senators in 1914.

==Women&#x27;s suffrage==
The women&#x27;s suffrage movement began with the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention; many of the activists became politically aware during the abolitionist movement. The movement reorganized after the Civil War, gaining experienced campaigners, many of whom had worked for prohibition in the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union. By the end of the 19th century a few western states had granted women full voting rights, though women had made significant legal victories, gaining rights in areas such as property and child custody.

Around 1912, the movement, which had grown sluggish, began to reawaken. This put an emphasis on its demands for equality and arguing that the corruption of American politics demanded purification by women because men could no longer do their job. Protests became increasingly common as suffragette Alice Paul led parades through the capitol and major cities. Paul split from the large National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), which favored a more moderate approach and supported the Democratic Party and Woodrow Wilson, led by Carrie Chapman Catt, and formed the more militant National Woman&#x27;s Party. Suffragists were arrested during their &quot;Silent Sentinels&quot; pickets at the White House, the first time such a tactic was used, and were taken as political prisoners.

Finally, the suffragettes were ordered released from prison, and Wilson urged Congress to pass a Constitutional amendment enfranchising women. The old anti-suffragist argument that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men deserved the franchise, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation of tens of thousands of American women on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first voting woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that Women&#x27;s Suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Nevertheless, Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919. It became a constitutional law on August 26, 1920, after ratification by the 36th required state.

==Foreign policy==
With the landslide election victory of William McKinley, who had risen to national prominence six years earlier with the passage of the McKinley Tariff of 1890, a high tariff was passed in 1897 and a decade of rapid economic growth and prosperity ensued, building national self-confidence. McKinley brought in a new governing philosophy, one that dominated the 20th century, in which politics was the arena in which compromises among interest groups were worked out for the national benefit. His system of politics emphasized economic growth, prosperity for all, and pluralism that provided benefits for every group. He rejected programs such as prohibition and immigration restriction that were designed to hurt an enemy. He felt parties had the duty to enact the people&#x27;s will and educate them to new ideas.

===War with Spain===

Spain had once controlled a vast colonial empire, but by the second half of the 19th century only Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and some African possessions remained: Spanish West Africa (Spanish Sahara), Spanish Guinea, Spanish Morocco and the Canary Islands. The Cubans had been in a state of rebellion since the 1870s, and American newspapers, particularly New York City papers of William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, printed sensationalized &quot;Yellow Journalism&quot; stories about Spanish atrocities in Cuba. However, these lurid stories reached only a small fraction of voters; most read sober accounts of Spanish atrocities, and they called for intervention. On February 15, 1898, the battleship USS &quot;Maine&quot; exploded in Havana Harbor. Although it was unclear precisely what caused the blast, many Americans believed it to be the work of a Spanish mine, an attitude encouraged by the yellow journalism of Hearst and Pulitzer. The military was rapidly mobilized as the U.S. prepared to intervene in the Cuban revolt. It was made clear that no attempt at annexation of Cuba would be made and that the island&#x27;s independence would be guaranteed. Spain considered this a wanton intervention in its internal affairs and severed diplomatic relations. War was declared on April 25.

The Spanish were quickly defeated, and Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders gained fame in Cuba. Meanwhile, Commodore George Dewey&#x27;s fleet crushed the Spanish in the faraway Philippines. Spain capitulated, ending the three-month-long war and recognizing Cuba&#x27;s independence. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded to the United States.

Although U.S. capital investments within the Philippines and Puerto Rico were small, some politicians hoped they would be strategic outposts for expanding trade with Latin America and Asia, particularly China. That never happened and after 1903 American attention turned to the Panama Canal as the key to opening new trade routes. The Spanish–American War thus began the active, globally oriented American foreign policy that continues to the present day.

===Philippines===

The U.S. acquired the Philippines from Spain on December 10, 1898, via the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Spanish–American War. However, Philippine nationalists led by Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence and in 1899 began fighting the occupying U.S. troops. The Philippine–American War ended in 1902 after Aguinaldo was captured and swore allegiance to the U.S. Likewise the other insurgents accepted American rule and peace prevailed, except in some remote islands under Muslim control.

Roosevelt continued the McKinley policies of removing the Catholic friars (with compensation to the Pope) and spreading Protestantism in the islands, upgrading the infrastructure, introducing public health programs, and launching a program of economic and social modernization. The enthusiasm shown in 1898–99 for colonies cooled off, and Roosevelt saw the islands as &quot;our heel of Achilles.&quot; He told Taft in 1907, &quot;I should be glad to see the islands made independent, with perhaps some kind of international guarantee for the preservation of order, or with some warning on our part that if they did not keep order we would have to interfere again.&quot; By then the President and his foreign policy advisers turned away from Asian issues to concentrate on Latin America, and Roosevelt redirected Philippine policy to prepare the islands to become the first Western colony in Asia to achieve self-government, holding its first democratic elections in 1907. The Jones Law, passed in 1916, increased Filipino self-governance and guaranteed eventual Philippine independence, which was finally achieved in 1946.

===Latin America===

The U.S. demanded Spain stop its oppressive policies in Cuba; public opinion (overruling McKinley) led to the short, successful Spanish–American War in 1898. The U.S. permanently took over Puerto Rico and temporarily held Cuba. Attention increasingly focused on the Caribbean as the rapid growth of the Pacific states, especially California, revealed the need for a canal across to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Plans for one in Nicaragua fell through but under Roosevelt&#x27;s leadership the U.S. built a canal through Panama, after finding a public health solution to the deadly disease environment. The Panama Canal opened in 1914.

In 1904, Roosevelt announced his &quot;Corollary&quot; to the Monroe Doctrine, stating that the United States would intervene in cases where Latin American governments prove incapable or unstable in the interest of bringing democracy and financial stability to them. The U.S. made numerous interventions, mostly to stabilize the shaky governments and permit the nations to develop their economies. The intervention policy ended in the 1930s and was replaced by the Good Neighbor policy.

In 1909, Nicaraguan President José Santos Zelaya resigned after the triumph of U.S.-backed rebels. This was followed up by the 1912–1933 U.S. occupation of Nicaragua.

The U.S. military occupation of Haiti, in 1915, followed the mob execution of Haiti&#x27;s leader Vilbrun Guillaume Sam but even more important was the threat of a possible German takeover of the island. Germans controlled 80% of the Haitian economy by 1914 and they were bankrolling revolutions that kept the country in political turmoil. The conquest resulted in a 19-year-long United States occupation of Haiti. Haiti was an exotic locale that suggested black racial themes to numerous American writers including Eugene O&#x27;Neill, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Orson Welles.

Limited American intervention occurred in Mexico as that country fell into a long period of anarchy and civil war starting in 1910. In April 1914, U.S. troops occupied the Mexican port of Veracruz following the Tampico Incident; the reason for the intervention was Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s desire to overthrow the Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. In March 1916, Pancho Villa led 1,500 Mexican raiders in a cross-border attack against Columbus, New Mexico, attacked a U.S. Cavalry detachment, seized 100 horses and mules, burned the town, and killed 17 of its residents. President Woodrow Wilson responded by sending 12,000 troops, under Gen. John J. Pershing, into Mexico to pursue Villa. The Pancho Villa Expedition to capture Villa failed in its objectives and was withdrawn in January 1917.

In 1916, the U.S. occupied the Dominican Republic.

==Progressive Era==
A new spirit of the times, known as &quot;Progressivism&quot;, arose in the 1890s and into the 1920s (although some historians date the ending with World War I).

In 1904, reflecting the age, and perhaps prescient of difficulties arising in the early part of the next millennium (including the rise of a demagogue in the land trying to array society into two camps), the Hungarian born Joseph Pulitzer wrote about the dangers ahead for the republic:

:Our Republic and its press will rise or fall together. An able, disinterested, public-spirited press, with trained intelligence to know the right and courage to do it, can preserve that public virtue without which popular government is a sham and a mockery. A cynical, mercenary, demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself. The power to mould the future of the Republic will be in the hands of the journalists of future generations.

The presidential election of 1900 gave the U.S. a chance to pass judgment on the McKinley Administration, especially its foreign policy. Meeting at Philadelphia, the Republicans expressed jubilation over the successful outcome of the war with Spain, the restoration of prosperity, and the effort to obtain new markets through the Open Door Policy. The 1900 election was mostly a repeat of 1896 except for imperialism being added as a new issue (Hawaii had been annexed in 1898). William Jennings Bryan added anti-imperialism to his tired-out free silver rhetoric, but he was defeated in the face of peace, prosperity and national optimism.

President William McKinley was enjoying great popularity as he began his second term, but it would be cut short. In September 1901, while attending an exposition in Buffalo, New York, McKinley was shot by an anarchist. He was the third president to be assassinated, all since the Civil War. Vice President Theodore Roosevelt assumed the presidency.

Political corruption was a central issue, which reformers hoped to solve through civil service reforms at the national, state, and local level, replacing political hacks with professional . The 1883 Civil Service Reform Act (or Pendleton Act), which placed most federal employees on the merit system and marked the end of the so-called &quot;spoils system&quot;, permitted the professionalization and rationalization of the federal administration. However, local and municipal government remained in the hands of often-corrupt politicians, political machines, and their local &quot;bosses&quot;. Henceforth, the spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties, and municipalities, such as the Tammany Hall ring, which survived well into the 1930s when New York City reformed its own civil service. Illinois modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under Frank Lowden, but Chicago held out against civil service reform until the 1970s.

Many self-styled progressives saw their work as a crusade against urban political bosses and corrupt &quot;robber barons&quot;. There were increased demands for effective regulation of business, a revived commitment to public service, and an expansion of the scope of government to ensure the welfare and interests of the country as the groups pressing these demands saw fit. Almost all the notable figures of the period, whether in politics, philosophy, scholarship, or literature, were connected at least in part with the reform movement. In many cases progressives, most notably the Roosevelts, hailed from old blue blood families that dated to the colonial era and felt resentment at their increased irrelevance in the face of the new class of robber baron capitalists, most of whom had been born to modest means.

Trenchant articles dealing with trusts, high finance, impure foods, and abusive railroad practices began to appear in the daily newspapers and in such popular magazines as &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. Their authors, such as the journalist Ida M. Tarbell, who crusaded against the Standard Oil Trust, became known as &quot;Muckrakers&quot;. In his novel, &quot;The Jungle&quot;, Upton Sinclair exposed unsanitary conditions in the Chicago meat packing houses.

The hammering impact of Progressive Era writers bolstered aims of certain sectors of the population, especially a middle class caught between political machines and big corporations, to take political action. Many states enacted laws to improve the conditions under which people lived and worked. At the urging of such prominent social critics as Jane Addams, child labor laws were strengthened and new ones adopted, raising age limits, shortening work hours, restricting night work, and requiring school attendance. By the early 20th century, most of the larger cities and more than half the states had established an eight-hour day on public works. Equally important were the Workers&#x27; Compensation Laws, which made employers legally responsible for injuries sustained by employees at work. New revenue laws were also enacted, which, by taxing inheritances, laid the groundwork for the contemporary federal income tax.

By the end of the Progressive Era various laws were introduced concerning workplace issues including those related to hours of labor, health and safety, levels and frequency of pay, rest periods, the employment of women and children, compensation for injuries, vacations, and provisions for retirement. In addition, various laws related to social welfare, housing, education, relief of farmers, and public health were introduced.

===Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency===
Roosevelt, a progressive Republican, called for a &quot;Square Deal&quot;, and initiated a policy of increased Federal supervision in the enforcement of antitrust laws. Later, extension of government supervision over the railroads prompted the passage of major regulatory bills. One of the bills made published rates the lawful standard, and shippers equally liable with railroads for rebates.

Following Roosevelt&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1904 election he called for still more drastic railroad regulation, and in June 1906, Congress passed the Hepburn Act. This gave the Interstate Commerce Commission real authority in regulating rates, extended the jurisdiction of the commission, and forced the railroads to surrender their interlocking interests in steamship lines and coal companies. Roosevelt held many meetings, and opened public hearings, in a successful effort to find a compromise for the Coal Strike of 1902, which threatened the fuel supplies of urban America. Meanwhile, Congress had created a new Cabinet Department of Commerce and Labor.
Conservation of the nation&#x27;s natural resources and beautiful places was a very high priority for Roosevelt, and he raised the national visibility of the issue. The President called for a far-reaching and integrated program of conservation, reclamation and irrigation as early as 1901 in his first annual message to Congress. Whereas his predecessors had set aside 46 million acres (188,000 km2) of timberland for preservation and parks, Roosevelt increased the area to 146 million acres (592,000 km2) and began systematic efforts to prevent forest fires and to retimber denuded tracts. His appointment of his friend Gifford Pinchot as chief forester resulted in vigorous new scientific management of public lands. TR added 50 wildlife refuges, 5 new national parks, and initiated the system of designating national monuments, such as the Devils Tower National Monument.

===President Taft===
Roosevelt&#x27;s popularity was at its peak as the campaign of 1908 neared, but he was unwilling to break the tradition by which no president had held office for more than two terms. Instead, he supported William Howard Taft. On the Democratic side, William Jennings Bryan ran for a third time, but managed to carry only the South. Taft, a former judge, first colonial governor of the U.S.-held Philippines and administrator of the Panama Canal Zone, made some progress with his Dollar Diplomacy.

Taft continued the prosecution of trusts, further strengthened the Interstate Commerce Commission, established a postal savings bank and a parcel post system, expanded the civil service, and sponsored the enactment of two amendments to the United States Constitution. The Sixteenth Amendment authorized a federal income tax, while the Seventeenth Amendment, ratified in 1913, mandated the direct election of U.S. Senators by the people, replacing the prior system established in the original Constitution, in which they were selected by state legislatures.

Yet balanced against these achievements was Taft&#x27;s support for the Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act with protective schedules that outraged progressive opinion. Protection was the ideological cement holding the Republican coalition together. High tariffs were used by Republicans to promise higher sales to business, higher wages to industrial workers, and higher demand for farm products. Progressive insurgents said it promoted monopoly. Democrats said it was a tax on the little man. It had greatest support in the Northeast, and greatest opposition in the South and West. The Midwest was the battle ground. Insurgents also complained about his opposition to statehood for Arizona because of its progressive constitution; his opposition to environmental activists; and his growing reliance on the conservative wing of his party. His patron Roosevelt became his enemy by 1910. The Republican Party was divided, and an overwhelming vote swept the Democrats back into control of Congress in the 1910 elections.

===President Wilson===
Two years later, Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic, progressive governor of the state of New Jersey, campaigned against Taft, the Republican candidate, and against Roosevelt who was appalled by his successor&#x27;s policies and thus broke his earlier pledge to not run for a third term. As the Republicans would not nominate him, he ran as a third-party Progressive Party candidate, but the ticket became widely known as the Bull Moose Party. The election was mainly a contest between Roosevelt and Wilson, Taft receiving little attention and carrying just eight electoral votes.

Wilson, in a spirited campaign, defeated both rivals. Under his leadership, the new Congress enacted one of the most notable legislative programs in American history. Its first task was tariff revision. &quot;The tariff duties must be altered,&quot; Wilson said. &quot;We must abolish everything that bears any semblance of privilege.&quot; The Underwood Tariff in 1913 provided substantial rate reductions on imported raw materials and foodstuffs, cotton and woolen goods, iron and steel, and removed the duties from more than a hundred other items. Although the act retained many protective features, it was a genuine attempt to lower the cost of living for American workers.

The second item on the Democratic program was a reorganization of the banking and currency system. &quot;Control,&quot; said Wilson, &quot;must be public, not private, must be vested in the government itself, so that the banks may be the instruments, not the masters, of business and of individual enterprise and initiative.&quot;

Passage of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was one of Wilson&#x27;s most enduring legislative accomplishments, for he successfully negotiated a compromise between Wall Street and the agrarians. The plan built on ideas developed by Senator Nelson Aldrich, who discovered the European nations had more efficient central banks that helped their internal business and international trade. The new organization divided the country into 12 districts, with a Federal Reserve Bank in each, all supervised by a Federal Reserve Board. These banks were owned by local banks and served as depositories for the cash reserves of member banks. Until the Federal Reserve Act, the U.S. government had left control of its money supply largely to unregulated private banks. While the official medium of exchange was gold coins, most loans and payments were carried out with bank notes, backed by the promise of redemption in gold. The trouble with this system was that the banks were tempted to reach beyond their cash reserves, prompting periodic panics during which fearful depositors raced to turn their bank paper into coin. With the passage of the act, greater flexibility in the money supply was assured, and provision was made for issuing federal reserve notes—paper dollars—to meet business demands. The Fed opened in 1914 and played a central role in funding the World War. After 1914, issues of money and banking faded away from the political agenda.

To resolve the long-standing dispute over trusts, the Wilson Administration dropped the &quot;trust-busting&quot; legal strategies of Roosevelt and Taft and relied on the new Federal Trade Commission to issue orders prohibiting &quot;unfair methods of competition&quot; by business concerns in interstate trade. In addition a second law, the Clayton Antitrust Act, forbade many corporate practices that had thus far escaped specific condemnation—interlocking directorates, price discrimination among purchasers, use of the injunction in labor disputes and ownership by one corporation of stock in similar enterprises. After 1914 the trust issue faded away from politics.

The Adamson Act of 1916 established an eight-hour day for railroad labor and solidified the ties between the labor unions and the Democratic Party. The record of achievement won Wilson a firm place in American history as one of the nation&#x27;s foremost liberal reformers. Wilson&#x27;s domestic reputation would soon be overshadowed by his record as a wartime president who led his country to victory but could not hold the support of his people for the peace that followed.

<text>The Institut Laue–Langevin (ILL) is an internationally financed scientific facility, situated on the Polygone Scientifique in Grenoble, France. It is one of the world centres for research using neutrons. Founded in 1967 and honouring the physicists Max von Laue and Paul Langevin, the ILL provides one of the most intense neutron sources in the world and the most intense continuous neutron flux in the world in the moderator region: 1.5×1015 neutrons per second per cm2, with a thermal power of typically 58.3 MW.

The ILL neutron scattering facilities allow the analysis of the structure of conducting and magnetic materials for future electronic devices, the measurement of stresses in mechanical materials. It also allows investigations into macromolecular assemblies, particularly protein dynamics and biomolecular structure. It is a world-renowned centre for nanoscale science.

== History ==

The institute was founded by France and Germany, with the United Kingdom becoming the third major partner in 1973. These partner states provide, through Research Councils, the bulk of its funding. Ten other countries have since become partners. Scientists of institutions in the member states may apply to use the ILL facilities, and may invite scientists from other countries to participate. Experimental time is allocated by a scientific council involving ILL users. The use of the facility and travel costs for researchers are paid for by the institute. Commercial use, for which a fee is charged, is not subject to the scientific council review process. Over 750 experiments are completed every year, in fields including magnetism, superconductivity, materials engineering, and the study of liquids, colloids and biological substances such as proteins. 

The high-flux research reactor produces neutrons through fission in a compact-core fuel element. Neutron moderators cool the neutrons to wavelengths usable experimentally. Neutrons are then directed at a suite of instruments to probe the structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering, and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the neutron. Fission products and gamma rays produced by nuclear reactions in the reactor core are also used by the instrument suite.

In 2000 began the introduction of new instruments and instrument upgrades. The first phase has already resulted in a 17-fold gains in performance. The second phase started in 2008: it comprises the building of 5 new instruments, the upgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.

== EPN Science Campus ==

The ILL shares its site, the &#x27;epn science campus&#x27;, with other institutions including the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the Unit for Viral Host Cell Interactions (UVHCI). The French Institut de Biologie Structural (IBS) joined the campus in 2013.

== Participants ==

The ILL is governed by its Associates.

== Applications research ==

In 2019, researchers unravelled information about a protein causing progressive diseases. 

In summer 2016 the Institut Laue–Langevin demonstrated that a molecule called ectoine is used by Halomonas titanicae near the wreck of RMS Titanic to survive the osmotic pressure that salt water causes on their membranes.

== Awards and recognitions ==
The physicist Duncan Haldane who worked at the institute from 1977 to 1981 received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016 with Michael Kosterlitz and David J. Thouless for their work on the transitions of topological phases in the material.

Rudolf Mossbauer, Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, succeeded Heinz Maier-Leibnitz in 1972 as the director of the institute.

The physicist Philippe Nozieres, who worked at the institute from 1972 until his retirement, received the Wolf Prize in 1985, together with Conyers Herring, for their major contributions to the fundamental theory of solids, especially the behaviour of electrons in metals.

<text>The Magellanic plover (Pluvianellus socialis) is a rare wader endemic to southernmost South America.

==Taxonomy==
It was long placed in with the other plovers in the family Charadriidae; however, behavioural evidence suggested they were distinct, and molecular studies confirmed this, suggesting that they are actually more closely related to the sheathbills, a uniquely Antarctic family. As such it is now placed in its own family, Pluvianellidae.

==Description==
This species is in its structure and habits much like a turnstone, but it cannot be confused with any other wader species. Its upperparts and breast are pale grey, and the rest of the underparts are white. It has short red legs, a black bill and red eyes. In young birds, the eyes and legs are yellowish in colour, and the plumage is grey overall with scaling. The call is a dovelike &quot;coo&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is not a long-distance migrant, although some birds move further north in southern Argentina in winter. The species breeds inland and then moves to the coast during the winter, particularly to estuaries. One of their preferred areas during winter is in Puerto Madryn and Península Valdes, Chubut, Argentina (Jehl 1975).

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
This species breeds near water, usually saline lakes but there are reports of nests near rivers as well. Pairs defend territories, and both parents share incubation duties. It lays two large eggs on the ground, although usually only one chick survives. One unique aspect of its behaviour and physiology is its method of feeding its chicks. Chicks are fed by regurgitating food stored in the crop, this species being the only wader to do so.

===Feeding===
Magellanic plovers feed on small invertebrates, picked from the ground, or from under pebbles, again like a turnstone. They have been observed collecting worms in the bill in a similar fashion to a puffin.

<doc id="265089" wikidata="Q691313" url="?curid=265089" title="Credit derivative">
<text>In finance, a credit derivative refers to any one of &quot;various instruments and techniques designed to separate and then transfer the &quot;credit risk&quot;&quot; or the risk of an event of default of a corporate or sovereign borrower, transferring it to an entity other than the lender or debtholder.

An unfunded credit derivative is one where credit protection is bought and sold between bilateral counterparties without the protection seller having to put up money upfront or at any given time during the life of the deal unless an event of default occurs. Usually these contracts are traded pursuant to an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreement. Most credit derivatives of this sort are credit default swaps. If the credit derivative is entered into by a financial institution or a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and payments under the credit derivative are funded using securitization techniques, such that a debt obligation is issued by the financial institution or SPV to support these obligations, this is known as a funded credit derivative.

This synthetic securitization process has become increasingly popular over the last decade, with the simple versions of these structures being known as synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), credit-linked notes or single-tranche CDOs. In funded credit derivatives, transactions are often rated by rating agencies, which allows investors to take different slices of credit risk according to their risk appetite.

== History and participants ==
The historical antecedents of trade credit insurance, which date back at least to the 1860s, also presaged credit derivatives more indirectly. 

The market in credit derivatives as defined in today&#x27;s terms started from nothing in 1993 after having been pioneered by J.P. Morgan&#x27;s Peter Hancock. By 1996 there was around $40 billion of outstanding transactions, half of which involved the debt of developing countries.

Credit default products are the most commonly traded credit derivative product and include unfunded products such as credit default swaps and funded products such as collateralized debt obligations (see further discussion below).

On May 15, 2007, in a speech concerning credit derivatives and liquidity risk, Timothy Geithner, then President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, stated: “Financial innovation has improved the capacity to measure and manage risk.” Credit market participants, regulators, and courts are increasingly using credit derivative pricing to help inform decisions about loan pricing, risk management, capital requirements, and legal liability.
The ISDA reported in April 2007 that total notional amount on outstanding credit derivatives was $35.1 trillion with a gross market value of $948 billion (ISDA&#x27;s Website). As reported in &quot;The Times&quot; on September 15, 2008, the &quot;Worldwide credit derivatives market is valued at $62 trillion&quot;.

Although the credit derivatives market is a global one, London has a market share of about 40%, with the rest of Europe having about 10%.

The main market participants are banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, pension funds, and other corporates.

== Types ==
Credit derivatives are fundamentally divided into two categories: funded credit derivatives and unfunded credit derivatives.

An unfunded credit derivative is a bilateral contract between two counterparties, where each party is responsible for making its payments under the contract (i.e., payments of premiums and any cash or physical settlement amount) itself without recourse to other assets.

A funded credit derivative involves the protection seller (the party that assumes the credit risk) making an initial payment that is used to settle any potential credit events. (The protection buyer, however, still may be exposed to the &quot;credit risk&quot; of the &quot;protection seller&quot; itself. This is known as counterparty risk.)

Unfunded credit derivative products include the following products:
* Credit default swap (CDS)
* Total return swap
* Constant maturity credit default swap (CMCDS)
* First to Default Credit Default Swap
* Portfolio Credit Default Swap
* Secured Loan Credit Default Swap
* Credit Default Swap on Asset Backed Securities
* Credit default swaption
* Recovery lock transaction
* Credit Spread Option
* CDS index products

Funded credit derivative products include the following products:
* Credit-linked note (CLN)
* Synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO)
* Constant Proportion Debt Obligation (CPDO)
* Synthetic constant proportion portfolio insurance (Synthetic CPPI)

=== Key unfunded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit default swap ====

The credit default swap or CDS has become the cornerstone product of the credit derivatives market. This product represents over thirty percent of the credit derivatives market.

The product has many variations, including where there is a basket or portfolio of reference entities, although fundamentally, the principles remain the same. A powerful recent variation has been gathering market share of late: credit default swaps which relate to asset-backed securities.

==== Total return swap ====
=== Key funded credit derivative products ===

==== Credit linked notes ====

A credit linked note is a note whose cash flow depends upon an event, which may be a default, change in credit spread, or rating change. The definition of the relevant credit events must be negotiated by the parties to the note.

A CLN in effect combines a credit-default swap with a regular note (with coupon, maturity, redemption). Given its note-like features, a CLN is an on-balance-sheet asset, in contrast to a CDS.

Typically, an investment fund manager will purchase such a note to hedge against possible down grades, or loan defaults.

Numerous different types of credit linked notes (CLNs) have been structured and placed in the past few years. Here we are going to provide an overview rather than a detailed account of these instruments.

The most basic CLN consists of a bond, issued by a well-rated borrower, packaged with a credit default swap on a less creditworthy risk.

For example, a bank may sell some of its exposure to a particular emerging country by issuing a bond linked to that country&#x27;s default or convertibility risk. From the bank&#x27;s point of view, this achieves the purpose of reducing its exposure to that risk, as it will not need to reimburse all or part of the note if a credit event occurs. However, from the point of view of investors, the risk profile is different from that of the bonds issued by the country. If the bank runs into difficulty, their investments will suffer even if the country is still performing well.

The credit rating is improved by using a proportion of government bonds, which means the CLN investor receives an enhanced coupon.

Through the use of a credit default swap, the bank receives some recompense if the reference credit defaults.

There are several different types of securitized product, which have a credit dimension.
* Credit-linked notes (CLN): Credit-linked note is a generic name related to any bond whose value is linked to the performance of a reference asset, or assets. This link may be through the use of a credit derivative, but does not have to be.
* Collateralized debt obligation (CDO): Generic term for a bond issued against a mixed pool of assets—there also exists CDO-Squared (CDO^2) where the underlying assets are CDO tranches.
* Collateralized bond obligations (CBO): Bond issued against a pool of bond assets or other securities. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO
* Collateralized loan obligations (CLO): Bond issued against a pool of bank loan. It is referred to in a generic sense as a CDO

CDO refers either to the pool of assets used to support the CLNs or the CLNs themselves.

==== Collateralized debt obligations ====

Not all collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) are credit derivatives. For example, a CDO made up of loans is merely a securitizing of loans that is then tranched based on its credit rating. This particular securitization is known as a collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and the investor receives the cash flow that accompanies the paying of the debtor to the creditor. Essentially, a CDO is held up by a pool of assets that generate cash. A CDO only becomes a derivative when it is used in conjunction with credit default swaps (CDS), in which case it becomes a Synthetic CDO. The main difference between CDOs and derivatives is that a derivative is essentially a bilateral agreement in which the payout occurs during a specific event which is tied to the underlying asset.

Other more complicated CDOs have been developed where each underlying credit risk is itself a CDO tranche. These CDOs are commonly known as CDOs-squared.

== Pricing ==
Pricing of credit derivative is not an easy process. This is because:
* The complexity in monitoring the market price of the underlying credit obligation.
* Understanding the creditworthiness of a debtor is often a cumbersome task as it is not easily quantifiable.
* The incidence of default is not a frequent phenomenon and makes it difficult for the investors to find the empirical data of a solvent company with respect to default.
* Even though one can take help of different ratings published by ranking agencies but often these ratings will be different.

== Risks ==
Risks involving credit derivatives are a concern among regulators of financial markets. The US Federal Reserve issued several statements in the Fall of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog of confirmations for credit derivatives trades. These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they exacerbate other risks in the financial system. One challenge in regulating these and other derivatives is that the people who know most about them also typically have a vested incentive in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. Incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in keeping open doors for research.

<text>The year 1727 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* Maharaja Jai Singh II begins construction of the Jantar Mantar observatory at Jaipur.

==Biology==
* Rev. Stephen Hales publishes &quot;Vegetable Staticks&quot;, containing an account of key experiments in plant physiology; and makes the first measurement of blood pressure.

==Mathematics==
* This year&#x27;s French Academy of Sciences prize is based on a problem on the masting of ships: to calculate the number of masts to use and where in the ship to locate them. Pierre Bouguer gains the award for his paper &quot;On the masting of ships&quot;; and two other prizes, one for his dissertation &quot;On the best method of observing the altitude of stars at sea&quot; and the other for his paper &quot;On the best method of observing the variation of the compass at sea&quot;. The 19-year-old Euler enters for the prize with an essay written in 1726 and published in 1728.

==Optics==
* Eyeglasses, with side pieces that rest on the ears, are invented by Englishman Edward Scarlett.

==Pharmacology==
* Elizabeth Gooking Greenleaf opens an apothecary shop in Boston, Massachusetts, the first woman to so practice in America.

==Other events==
* The kilt is invented by Thomas Rawlinson, the English owner of an ironworks, who designs it as a cheap uniform for better maneuverability around machinery. Ian MacDonnel of Glengarry adopts the garment along with his clansmen, and the kilt is worn throughout the Highlands by 1745.

==Births==
* March 19 – Ferdinand Berthoud, Swiss clockmaker and maker of scientific instruments (died 1807)
* April 7 – Michel Adanson, French botanist (died 1806)

==Deaths==
* March 31 – Isaac Newton, English physicist and mathematician (born 1643)
* March 22 – Johann Leonhard Rost, German astronomer (born 1688)

<doc id="265093" wikidata="Q334830" url="?curid=265093" title="Moïse Tshombe">
<text>Moïse Kapenda Tshombe (sometimes written Tshombé; 10 November 1911 – 29 June 1969) was a Congolese businessman and politician. He served as the president of the secessionist State of Katanga from 1960 to 1963 and as prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)) from 1964 to 1965.

Tshombe was born to an aristocratic Lunda family and ran several businesses in Katanga Province before becoming involved in politics, cofounding the pro-Western, anti-communist CONAKAT party in 1958 and advocating for autonomy for Katanga province. Following the Republic of the Congo-Léopoldville&#x27;s accession to independence in June 1960, Tshombe became president of the autonomous province, and soon came into conflict with the central government&#x27;s leftist prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. Accusing Lumumba of communist sympathies, Tshombe declared Katanga&#x27;s independence as the breakaway State of Katanga, becoming a major actor of the Congo Crisis. Following Lumumba&#x27;s overthrow and execution by Tshombe&#x27;s supporters in 1961, the Katanga rebellion was suppressed in 1963, forcing Tshombe into exile.

The following year, he was made prime minister of the country as part of a new coalition government against the Simba rebellion by Lumumba&#x27;s supporters. In 1965, he founded the CONACO alliance, which comfortably won the March and April general elections. However, he was dismissed as Prime Minister in October of that year, being replaced by Évariste Kimba. Following the November 1965 coup which ended the Congo Crisis, he was charged with treason and was forced into exile again. He died four years later under disputed circumstances.

== Early life ==
A member of the Lunda ethnic group, Tshombe was born near Musumba, Belgian Congo, the son of a successful businessman. The Tshombe family were Lunda royalty and a number of Tshombes had reigned as the Mwaant Yav, the traditional king of the Lunda people. He received his education from an American missionary school and later trained as an accountant. In the 1950s, he took over a chain of stores in Katanga Province, which failed. Tshombe ran a number of businesses, which all failed, requiring his wealthy family to bail him out. Tshombe later became involved in politics.

Unlike the other provinces of the Belgian Congo, Katanga was rich in mineral resources, such as copper, tin and uranium, all of which were exploited by the &quot;Union Minière&quot; company. Uranium from the Shinkolobwe mine was used in developing nuclear weapons by the United States and Nazi Germany during World War II. By the 1950s, the prospect of wealth derived from the ores had attracted 32,000 Belgian settlers to Katanga, which was the highest number of whites for any province in Belgian Congo. The mining industry provided, by the standards of Africa, well paying jobs, and immigrants arrived from the other provinces of the Belgian Congo.

Tshombe, like many members of the Lunda royalty, was close to the settler elite, and felt threatened by the flood of Kasai Baluba moving into Katanga. In the late 1950s, the Belgians allowed a limited degree of democracy in the Belgian Congo and in the first municipal elections in 1957, the majority of the mayors elected were Baluba, which sparked fears that the Lunda would be a marginalized group in their own province. Tshombe&#x27;s political involvement started in 1957 in response to the perceived threat of Baluba domination.

==Political career==
Along with Godefroid Munongo, he founded the Confédération des associations tribales du Katanga (CONAKAT) party. CONAKAT promoted a federal Congo independent of the Belgian colonial empire. CONAKAT was founded in October 1958 to address the perceived problems of &quot;immigration&quot; into Katanga from the other provinces of the Belgian Congo, and its platform called for upholding the rights of the &quot;indigenous&quot; peoples of Katanga by ending the &quot;immigration&quot;. The majority of the CONAKAT supporters were Lunda, Batabwa, Tshowke and Bayeke, most of whom lived in southern Katanga.

In common with the other members of the Lunda elite, the aristocratic Tshombe looked back nostalgically to the Kingdom of Lunda that once covered much of northern Angola, the southern Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia (modern Zambia) in the 17th and 18th centuries. CONAKAT formed an electoral alliance with the &quot;Union Katangaise&quot; party that represented the white Belgian settlers of Katanga. Both CONAKAT and the &quot;Union Katangaise&quot; wanted very broad autonomy for Katanga within an independent Congo in order to keep the wealth generated by the mining industry within Katanga. In contrast to CONAKAT with its calls for autonomy and curbs on &quot;immigration&quot;, the &quot;immigrants&quot; in Katanga tended to favor the parties that called for a more centralized state.

=== President of Katanga ===
CONAKAT won control of the Katanga provincial legislature in the May 1960 general elections. One month later, the Congo became an independent republic. Tshombe became President of the autonomous province of Katanga. Patrice Lumumba was tasked with forming a national government. Members of his party, the Mouvement National Congolais, were given charge of the portfolios of national defence and interior, despite Tshombe&#x27;s objections. The portfolio for economic affairs was awarded to a CONAKAT member, but this was undercut by the positioning of nationalists in control of the Ministry and Secretariat for Economic Coordination. Mines and land affairs were placed under separate portfolios. Tshombe declared that this diluting of CONAKAT&#x27;s influence rendered his agreement to support the government &quot;null and void&quot;.

On the evening of 11 July, Tshombe, accusing the central government of communist leanings and dictatorial rule, announced that Katanga was seceding from the Congo. Tshombe had the full support of both Belgium and the &quot;Union Minière&quot; in proclaiming Katanga independent. One American diplomat described Katanga as a sham, reporting to Washington that the State of Katanga was &quot;designed mainly for the protection of European lives and property&quot;. Favoring continued ties with Belgium, Tshombe asked the Belgian government to send military officers to recruit and train a Katangese army. Tshombe&#x27;s Belgian military adviser, Major Guy Weber, on 13 July 1960 appointed Major Jean-Marie Crèvecœur to train an army for Katanga.

To disguise its military nature, the force being raised and trained was called the Katangese gendarmerie, but this was highly misleading as it was in fact an army. The majority of the officers training the gendarmerie were Belgian. The Belgian historian Jules Gérard-Libois wrote: &quot;During the entire month of August, a veritable race against the clock took place with the objective, for Tshombe and his advisers, of building a more or less efficient gendarmery before the eventual withdraw of the Belgian troops&quot;. Tshombe engaged in a successful bluff in the summer of 1960 as he maintained that Katanga had the military forces to repel an invasion while an army was being raised.
Tshombe demanded United Nations recognition for independent Katanga, and he announced that any intervention by UN troops would be met with force. Nonetheless, Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and his successor, Cyrille Adoula, successfully requested intervention from UN forces. UN forces were sent under the direction of UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld.

The British diplomat Brian Urquhart, who met Tshombe several times, wrote: &quot;Tshombe was not stupid, but he desperately wanted to be liked and recognized. He tended to agree with the last person he had talked to and could be counted on to go back on any agreement as soon as he had seen his next visitor. He was also an accomplished hypochondriac, using feigned ill health to avoid answering awkward questions. “&quot;J’ai mal à la gorge, Monsieur Urquhart&quot;” (&quot;I have a sore throat, Mr. Urquhart&quot;), he would suddenly whisper. &quot;Je dois prendre immédiatement une piqûre&quot; (&quot;I must immediately get a [medical] shot.&quot;) And that would be the end of the conversation. Tshombe was basically a weak person who was always being manipulated by others – the &quot;Union Minière&quot;, right-wing politicians in Europe and the United States, mercenaries, arms dealers and other adventurers who were after his money.&quot;

France, wishing to take advantage of Katangese minerals, sent to Tshombe the reinforcement of the mercenary Bob Denard and his men. It was supported by the networks of Jacques Foccart, the &quot;Mr. Africa&quot; of the French government.

Lumumba&#x27;s government was dissolved, and Lumumba taken prisoner by Mobutu and detained at Camp Hardy in Thysville. Harold Charles d&#x27;Aspremont Lynden (Belgian minister for African Affairs) sent a highly confidential telegram on 16 January 1961 to the government in Léopoldville (President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu) to send Lumumba to Katanga. That would have stemmed from Lumumba&#x27;s increasing popularity among soldiers, who might release him. Meanwhile, soldier mutinies and unrest increased by the day, at Prison Camp Hardy in Thysville. The telegram has still not been shown to exist.

Whilst being flown in a Sabena Douglas DC-4 plane to Katanga, Lumumba was beaten by the Congolese soldiers escorting him. In custody in Katanga, Lumumba was visited by Katangese notables and Belgian officers, who included Tshombe, Godefroid Munongo, Kibwe, Kitenge, Grandelet, Son, Gat, Huyghé, Tignée, Verscheure, Segers and Rougefort. Lumumba&#x27;s execution, on 17 January, was carried out by a firing squad led by a Belgian mercenary, Julien Gat.

In September 1961, the United Nations launched Operation Morthor with the aim of reintegrating Katanga into the Congo, causing Tshombe to flee into Northern Rhodesia for a time. However, the Katangese gendarmerie proved to be tougher than expected and in the siege of Jadotville, Irish troops serving under the United Nations flag were forced to surrender. The United Nations secretary-general, Dag Hammarskjöld, flew to meet Tshombe to discuss a ceasefire. After the meeting, Hammarskjöld was killed in an airplane crash.

Tshombe become an iconic figure for American conservatives in the 1960s, who saw him as an acceptable African leader. The American historian Kyle Burke wrote: &quot;To them [American conservatives], Tshombe represented a comfortable kind of decolonization, in which elite Africans would manage the transition from colony to nation without altering the existing racial, political and economic order, thereby ensuring that communists would not gain a foothold in these countries&quot;. American conservatives presented the Belgian Congo as a place of racial harmony, which Tshombe had tried to preserve.

The principal lobbying group for Tshombe was the American Committee for Aid to Katangan Freedom Fighters that portrayed the United Nations as a communist-dominated organization that was seeking to crush Katanga to achieve Soviet foreign policy goals in Africa. The support for Tshombe was at least in part related to American domestic politics as the Kennedy administration supported the United Nations against Katanga and the support for Tshombe in the United States came mostly from conservative Republicans and Democrats, who used Kennedy&#x27;s opposition to Tshombe to argue that he was &quot;soft on communism&quot;. By contrast, Afro-Americans loathed Tshombe, seeing him as an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; figure, a black man who was submissive and docile towards whites.

=== Prime Minister of the Congo ===

In 1963, UN forces succeeded in suppressing Katanga, driving Tshombe into exile in Northern Rhodesia and then Spain. Tshombe took 890 suitcases full of one million gold pieces with him into exile, which he placed into various European banks, allowing him to live in comfort and luxury. At the same time, the UN forces found that the Katangese treasury had been stripped bare. The entire vault contained only £10 British pounds together with one dead rat.

In early 1964, the Simba rebellion broke out and the Congolese government rapidly lost control of the entire eastern half of the Congo. At the same time, Tshombe started to correspond with several of his former enemies such as the justice minister, Justin-Marie Bomboko; the police chief, Victor Nendaka; and most importantly, the commander of the army, General Joseph-Désiré Mobutu.

As the &quot;Armée Nationale Congolaise&quot; could not handle the Simbas, Mobutu argued that the Congo needed Western help. Mobutu had been the king-maker of Congolese politics ever since he staged his first coup in 1960. He pressured President Joseph Kasa-Vubu to appoint Tshombe premier on the grounds that he was the Congolese politician most likely to secure Western support.

Most of the economic concessions in the Belgian Congo were para-statal, as the Belgian state had invested its own funds alongside those of European capitalists in developing the concessions. When Belgium granted independence to the Congo in 1960, the Belgians refused to transfer their shares in the concessions to the Congolese state under the grounds that the Congo refused to assume the debts that the Belgians had incurred when developing the concessions, which deprived the Congolese state of much needed revenue.

In March 1964, the Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak visited Leopoldville and agreed to transfer the Belgian shares of the concessions. During the same visit, Spaak seems to have made appointing Tshombe premier the precondition of the share transfer. Finally, the administration of John F. Kennedy was very hostile towards Tshombe, but on 22 November 1963 Kennedy was assassinated. Kennedy&#x27;s successor, Lyndon B. Johnson was more supportive of Tshombe, viewing him as a firmly pro-Western politician.

In July 1964, he returned to the Congo to serve as prime minister in a new coalition government. His cabinet was sworn in on 10 July. Tshombe&#x27;s national support was derived from the backing of provincial political bosses, customary chiefs, and foreign financial interests. Among his first acts in office were the lifting of a curfew in Léopoldville, the release of 600 political prisoners—including Antoine Gizenga, and the ordering of Katangese gendarmes to return from their exile in Angola to the Congo and join the national army.

Tshombe had made extensive use of white mercenaries to fight for Katanga, and as the Congolese premier, he hired the same mercenaries to fight for the Congo. The return of Tshombe to power was met with criticism. Malcolm X detested Tshombe as an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, and in a 1964 speech in New York called him &quot;the worst African ever born&quot; and &quot;the man who in cold blood, cold blood, committed an international crime – murdered Patrice Lumumba&quot;.

In a New Year&#x27;s message at the beginning of 1965, Tshombe rejected conciliation with the Simba rebels and called for their total defeat. Tshombe formed the federalist Convention Nationale Congolaise (CONACO), a bloc of forty-nine parties for the 1965 general election. The party won comfortably gaining 38 seats with the alliance as a whole winning 122 seats. Despite this victory Tshombe was dismissed from his position as Prime Minister in October 1965 by President Kasa-Vubu and replaced by Évariste Kimba. In November, General Joseph Mobutu, who had just staged a successful coup against Kasa-Vubu, brought charges of treason against Tshombe, who again fled the country and settled in Francoist Spain.

== Later life ==
In 1965, Tshombe&#x27;s brother, Daniel, became the Mwaant Yav, which greatly added to his appeal in Katanga. Traditionally, the title of Mwaant Yav alternated between different Lunda royal families, but since 1965 the office of Mwaant Yav has been held by members of the Tshombe family. In 1967, Tshombe was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;.

On 30 June 1967, Tshombe was in a Hawker Siddeley jet aircraft that was hijacked by Francis Bodenan, an agent of the French SDECE. According to the Congolese government, Tshombe was travelling to Africa. He was taken to Algeria, jailed, and placed under house arrest. At his trial, he was represented by French lawyer René Floriot. The pilots of the plane, Britons Trevor Copleston and David Taylor, were released and returned to the United Kingdom. The Congolese government demanded his extradition to Congo and his Western supporters agitated for his release.

The Algerians resisted both demands. A part of his supporters gathered to form the Tshombe Emergency Committee in the U.S., including Marvin Liebman and William F. Buckley, to press for his release and move to Spain. The Tshombe Emergency Committee filed a number of legal challenges to force the Algerians to release Tshombe to no avail. Long-time aide Michel Struelens travelled to different European cities to lobby for Tshombe, eventually to no avail.

== Death and legacy ==

Tshombe died in Algeria in 1969. The Algerian government called in eight Algerian physicians and three French doctors, who concluded that he died in his sleep. Later, an autopsy concluded a natural death. Tshombe&#x27;s nephew Joseph Kayomb Tshombe stipulated that no medical doctor chosen by the Tshombe family was admitted at the autopsy.

Further doubts were raised regarding Tshombe&#x27;s death by former governor of Katanga and political exile Daniel Monguya Mbenge, who accused French lawyer Jacques Vergès of poisoning Tshombe by order of Mobutu. In the context of a series of interviews regarding a conspiracy theory about the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, Belgian mercenary Joseph Smal told author Stephen J. Rivele that Tshombe was killed by two injections with two different substances, prepared by the CIA.

Moïse Tshombe was buried in a Methodist service at Etterbeek Cemetery, near Brussels, Belgium. Owing to his role in the death of Lumumba and his association with Western interests, Tshombe&#x27;s name became synonymous with &quot;sellout&quot; to Black African nationalists.

Tshombe&#x27;s nephew, Jean Nguza Karl-i-Bond, later became an important politician and served as prime minister from 1980 to 1981.

== Portrayals ==
The plot of the 1978 war film &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; is based in part on speculation that Tshombe&#x27;s plane had initially been diverted to Rhodesia before being sent to Algeria. The film&#x27;s characters Colonel Allen Faulkner and President Julius Limbani were largely based on Tshombe and his military ally Maj. &quot;Mad Mike&quot; Hoare.

Tshombe has been played twice by the French actor Pascal N&#x27;Zonzi, first in the 2000 film &quot;Lumumba&quot; and again in the 2011 film &quot;Mister Bob&quot;. He was portrayed by Danny Sapani in the 2016 film &quot;The Siege of Jadotville&quot;.

<text>The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, better known as Lambda Legal, is an American civil rights organization that focuses on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) communities as well as people living with HIV/AIDS (PWAs) through impact litigation, societal education, and public policy work.
== History ==
Lambda&#x27;s founder William J. Thom, Esq. submitted incorporation papers for approval to the New York Courts in 1971, but his application was denied on the grounds that its proposed activities would be &quot;neither benevolent nor charitable in purpose&quot; and &quot;there was no demonstrated need for its existence&quot;. That decision was overturned in 1973 by the New York Court of Appeals, which is the highest court of New York State. (&quot;In re Thom&quot;, 301 N.E.2d 542 (N.Y. 1973).)

The original incorporators, in addition to Bill Thom, were E. Carrington Boggan, and Michael J. Lavery. At their first meeting on November 10, 1973, they were elected to the newly constituted board of directors namely Rodney L. Eubanks, Shepherd Raimi, and D. Nicholas Russo.

Because of the scarcity of openly gay lawyers in 1973, Lambda Legal formed a Board of Advisors of prominent New Yorkers sympathetic to the cause of gay rights. They included US Congressperson Bella Abzug, New York State Senator Carol Bellamy, Association of the Bar President Merrell E. Clark, Rev. John Corn of Trinity Church and Martin Duberman, Distinguished Professor at City University of New York. Also on the Board of Advisors were the two lawyers who later became New York State Supreme Court Justices: Phyllis Gangel-Jacob and Shirley Fingerhood.

From its inception, Lambda Legal sought diversity on its board of directors. Initially, it could find no lesbian lawyers who were willing or able to be openly associated with a gay activist organization. Nathalie Rockhill, a major figure in the early post-Stonewall days of Gay Liberation, was the first woman elected to the board in 1974. She was soon followed by lesbian law students and, in time, by lesbian lawyers. By the 1980s, men and women were equally represented on Lambda&#x27;s board.

Lambda&#x27;s growth paralleled the growth of the gay movement. By the 1980s, with the crisis of the AIDS epidemic getting more attention, awareness of gay activism had grown significantly. Thomas B. Stoddard, who was executive director from 1986 to 1992, helped to author a bill passed in 1986 by the New York City Council to protect queer people against bias in housing, employment, and public accommodations. Mayor Ed Koch, who signed the bill enacting it into law said: &quot;The legislation drafted by Tom Stoddard was perfect.&quot; In 1993, Stoddard and other nationally known gay leaders met with President Bill Clinton, first such delegation to meet inside the Oval Office.

In 2013, Lambda Legal – Midwest Regional Office was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

Its national headquarters remained in New York City, but today it has regional offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Washington.

== Work ==
Lambda Legal has played a role in many legal cases pertaining to gay rights, including the 6–3 United States Supreme Court&#x27;s 2003 decision in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which invalidated sodomy laws in the United States.

Lambda Legal also maintains a national network of volunteer Cooperating Attorneys, which widens the scope of their legal work and allows attorneys, legal workers and law students to become involved in the program by working with Lambda Legal&#x27;s legal staff.

Lambda Legal pursues litigation in all parts of the country, in every area of the law that affects communities they represent, such as discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, and the military; HIV/AIDS-related discrimination and public policy issues; parenting and relationship issues; equal marriage rights; equal employment and domestic partnership benefits; &quot;sodomy&quot; law challenges; immigration issues; anti-gay initiatives; and free speech and equal protection rights.
Before taking on legal work on behalf of same-sex marriage rights, Lambda Legal had to resolve an internal debate over the significance of marriage for its constituency and the strategic wisdom of taking on the issue. In 1990, it declined to represent the plaintiffs in the initial challenge to Hawaii&#x27;s denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. It filed an amicus brief in that case at a later stage and another in &quot;Dean v. District of Columbia&quot;, its first advocacy for same-sex marriage.

Lambda Legal publishes the &quot;Little Black Book&quot;, which contains information regarding the possible consequences of gay men &quot;cruising&quot; for sex in public places. The &quot;Little Black Book&quot; includes the following material: &quot;If you cruise in parks, bathrooms or other spaces open to public view, trust your instincts, be aware of your surroundings – and know your rights. While Lambda Legal and other groups are fighting against the ways police target men who have sex with men, having sex where others might see you and take offense can subject you to arrest, publicity and other serious consequences. If you feel unsafe, you should leave.&quot; The &quot;Little Black Book&quot; goes on to advise as follows: &quot;If you’re cruising for sex and an undercover cop hits on you, what you do can still be a crime.&quot;

In July 2012, Lambda founder Bill Thom was interviewed at his nursing home in Manhattan, and gave a first-hand account of the early years of Lambda Legal. This resulted in a letter from the current co-chair of Lambda Legal to Bill Thom dated September 25, 2012, in which he says &quot;The world is a vastly better place for LGBT people than when I started practice 20 years ago and is almost unrecognizable from the world in which you took on the heroic and unprecedented task of fighting back.&quot;

Represented by Lambda Legal, Immigration Equality and law firm Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius, in October 2020, the United States Department of State withdrew its appeal of the verdict in &quot;Kiviti v. Pompeo&quot;, and declined to appeal &quot;Mize-Gregg v. Pompeo&quot;. Federal district courts ruled the State Department&#x27;s refusal to recognize children born overseas to married same-sex, American citizen couples as U.S. citizens to be unlawful in both cases.

Following a 2017 Trump administration presidential order to ban transgender troops from the US military, Lambda indicated that they would be taking action to challenge the legality of the order. The order was blocked by courts until the Supreme Court allowed it to go into effect in January 2019, but was reversed two years later by executive order of President Biden, less than a week after his inauguration in January 2021.

In May 2022, Lambda Legal launched the first episode of its new podcast, &quot;Making the Case,&quot; hosted by Alex Berg. Listeners will have the opportunity to learn more about the creative strategies, unique challenges, and passion that helped win some of the most significant cases for the LGBTQ+ community and people living with HIV in recent memory.

== Attorneys and legal department ==
The legal department at Lambda Legal consists of a broad array of grassroots activists, corporate attorneys, Help Desk staff, and administrative professionals committed to achieving the full recognition of the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and people living with HIV:

Jenny Pizer, Chief Legal Officer and the Eden/Rushing Chair for Lambda Legal:

As Chief Legal Officer, Jenny Pizer leads Lambda Legal&#x27;s department of over 20 attorneys, 11 paraprofessionals, and five dozen impact litigation cases across the United States.

Pizer first joined Lambda Legal&#x27;s staff in 1986 as an intern while attending New York University School of Law. Pizer co-counseled the litigation that legalized marriage between same-sex couples in California on May 15, 2008, in &quot;re Marriage Cases&quot;. On August 18 of that same year, Pizer won a unanimous California Supreme Court victory in &quot;N. Coast Women&#x27;s Care Med. v. S.C&quot; on behalf of Guadalupe Benitez, a lesbian denied infertility due to the discriminatory religious objections brought forth by her doctor.

She clerked for the honorable Ann Aldrich of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, received her J.D. from New York University School of Law and her Bachelor of Arts from Harvard College.

== Public education ==
As a part of Lambda Legal&#x27;s education component, the organization periodically publishes articles, playbooks, and surveys to educate the general public and influence public policy on issues facing the LGBTQ+ community and people living with HIV.

On April 20, 2023, Lambda Legal partnered with the non-profit organizations Black and Pink National, and Strength in Numbers Consulting Group to publish the &quot;Protected &amp; Served? 2022 Report&quot;. The report is a data-quantitative information of personal stories conducted across over 2,500 LGBTQ+ people and people living with HIV capturing their experiences with misconduct involving police, courts, prisons, jails, schools, and other government agencies.

<text>The suborder Lari is the part of the order Charadriiformes that includes the gulls, terns, skuas and skimmers; the rest of the order is made up of the waders and snipes. The auks are now placed into the Lari too, following recent research.
 Sometimes, the buttonquails are also placed here, but the molecular data and fossil record rather suggests they are a quite basal offshoot along with the snipe-like and aberrant waders.

The larids are generally larger species that take fish from the sea. Several gulls and skuas will also take food items from beaches, or rob smaller species, and some have become adapted to inland environments.

The suborder Lari includes five to six families:
* Family Dromadidae – crab-plover 
* Family Glareolidae – coursers, pratincoles (17 species) 
* Family Laridae – gulls, terns, skimmers (103 species) 
* Family Stercorariidae – skuas (7 species)
* Family Alcidae – auks (25 species)
and sometimes:
* Family Turnicidae – buttonquails (18 species)

<doc id="265108" wikidata="Q3001111" url="?curid=265108" title="New York Supreme Court">
<text>The Supreme Court of the State of New York is the trial-level court of general jurisdiction in the judiciary of New York. It is vested with unlimited civil and criminal jurisdiction, although in many counties outside New York City it acts primarily as a court of civil jurisdiction, with most criminal matters handled in County Court. 

New York is the only state where the Supreme Court is a trial court rather than a court of last resort (which in New York is the Court of Appeals). Also, although it is a trial court, the Supreme Court sits as a &quot;single great tribunal of general state-wide jurisdiction, rather than an aggregation of separate courts sitting in the several counties or judicial districts of the state.&quot; The Supreme Court is established in each of New York&#x27;s 62 counties.

A separate branch of the Supreme Court called the Appellate Division serves as the highest intermediate appellate court in New York.

==Jurisdiction==
Under the New York State Constitution, the New York State Supreme Court has unlimited jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases, with the exception of certain monetary claims against the State of New York itself. In practice, the Supreme Court hears civil actions involving claims above a certain monetary amount (for example, $50,000 in New York City) that puts the claim beyond the jurisdiction of lower courts. Civil actions about lesser sums are heard by courts of limited jurisdiction, such as the New York City Civil Court, or the County Court, District Court, city courts, or justice courts (town and village courts) outside New York City.

The Supreme Court also hears civil cases involving claims for equitable relief, such as injunctions, specific performance, or rescission of a contract, as well as actions for a declaratory judgment. The Supreme Court also has exclusive jurisdiction of matrimonial actions, such as either contested or uncontested actions for a divorce or annulment. The court also has exclusive jurisdiction over &quot;Article 78 proceedings&quot; against a body or officer seeking to overturn an official determination on the grounds that it was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable or contrary to law.

At English Common Law, the lord chancellor, not as a part of his equitable jurisdiction, but as the king&#x27;s delegate to exercise the Crown&#x27;s special jurisdiction, had responsibility for the custody and protection of infants and the mentally incapacitated. Upon the organization of the Supreme Court in New York the Legislature transferred so much of the law as formed a part of the king&#x27;s prerogative to it. The Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court are responsible for oversight of the related programs.

With respect to criminal cases, the Criminal Branch of Supreme Court tries felony cases in the five counties of New York City, whereas they are primarily heard by the County Court elsewhere. Misdemeanor cases, and arraignments in almost all cases, are handled by lower courts: the New York City Criminal Court; the District Court in Nassau County and the five western towns of Suffolk County; city courts; and justice courts.

== The Commercial Division ==
In 1993, Administrative Judge Stanley S. Ostrau established pilot Commercial Parts in the New York County Supreme Court. Two years later, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye established a trial level Commercial Division, beginning in New York County (Manhattan) and Monroe County (the 7th Judicial District). The Commercial Division has expanded to the 8th District (located in Buffalo), and the Albany, Bronx, Kings, Nassau, Onondaga, Queens, Suffolk and Westchester County Supreme Courts. These are specialized business courts, with a defined jurisdiction focusing on business and commercial litigation. The jurisdictional amount in controversy required to have a case heard in the Commercial Division varies among these Commercial Division courts, ranging from $50,000 in Albany and Onondaga Counties to $500,000 in New York County, but the Commercial Division rules (Section 202.70) are otherwise uniform. 

The first specialist commercial judges assigned to the pilot Commercial Parts in 1993 were Justices Ira Gammerman, Myriam Altman, Herman Cahn, and Beatrice Shainswit. Among other long serving Commercial Division Justices, these judges served at least a decade: Justice Cahn continued on as a Commercial Division judge in Manhattan from 1995 until 2008, Justice Charles Ramos served as a Commercial Division judge in Manhattan from 1996-2018, Justice Elizabeth Hazlitt Emerson served in the Suffolk County Commercial Division from 2002-2023, Justice Carolyn E. Demarest served in the Brooklyn, Kings County Commercial Division from its inception in 2002 through 2016, Justice Deborah Karalunas presided in the Onondaga County (Syracuse) Commercial Division from its inception in 2007 for over 15 years, Justice Eileen Bransten served in the Manhattan Commercial Division from 2008 to 2018, Justice Timothy S. Driscoll has served in the Nassau County Commercial Division since 2009 (as of May 2024), and Justice Thomas A. Stander served in the Monroe County Commercial Division from its inception for ten years. One constant throughout the Commercial Division history has been the involvement of New York attorney Robert L. Haig, who, among other things, co-chaired the 1995 Commercial Courts Task Force, facilitated the 2006 Commercial Division Focus Group study, and has chaired the Commercial Division Advisory Council since 2013 (through at least May 2024). 

==Structure==

===Appellate Division===

Appeals from Supreme Court decisions, as well as from the Surrogate&#x27;s Court, Family Court, and Court of Claims, are heard by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division. This court is intermediate between the New York Supreme Court and the New York Court of Appeals.

There is one Appellate Division, which for administrative purposes comprises four judicial departments.

Decisions of the Appellate Division department panels are binding on the lower courts in that department, and also on lower courts in other departments unless there is contrary authority from the Appellate Division of that department.

===Appellate terms===
The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in each judicial department is authorized to establish &quot;appellate terms&quot;. An appellate term is an intermediate appellate court that hears appeals from the inferior courts within their designated counties or judicial districts, and are intended to ease the workload on the Appellate Division and provide a less expensive forum closer to the people.

Appellate terms are located in the 1st and 2nd Judicial Departments only, representing Downstate New York. These hear appeals from the New York City Civil Court, New York City Criminal Court, City Courts in the 1st and 2nd Departments, and District Court. (City Courts in other departments appeal to the County Courts instead.)

The 1st Department has a single Appellate Term covering Manhattan and The Bronx. The 2nd Department has two Appellate Terms. The Appellate Term for the 2nd, 11th and 13th Judicial Districts covers Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, and generally sits at 141 Livingston Street in Brooklyn. The Appellate Term for the 9th and 10th Judicial Districts covers Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Dutchess, and Putnam Counties; it generally rotates between the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains, the Nassau County Supreme Court Building in Mineola, and the Cohalan Court Complex in Central Islip. They occasionally sit at other locations within their jurisdiction.

Appellate terms consist of between three and five justices of the Supreme Court, appointed by the Chief Administrative Judge with the approval of presiding justice of the appropriate appellate division. The court sits in three-judge panels, with two justices constituting a quorum and being necessary for a decision. Decisions by the Appellate Term must be followed by courts whose appeals lie to it.

===Criminal terms===
In New York City, all felony cases are heard in criminal terms.

The Criminal Term of the Supreme Court, New York County is divided into 2 Trial Assignment parts, 10 conference and trial parts, 1 youth part, 1 narcotics/felony waiver part, 1 integrated domestic violence part, and 16 trial parts which include 1 Judicial Diversion part, 1 Mental Health part, 1 Veteran&#x27;s Court part, and 1 JHO part.

===Civil terms===
In New York City, all major civil cases are heard in civil terms.

==Administration==
The court system is divided into thirteen judicial districts: seven upstate districts each comprising between five and eleven counties, five districts corresponding to the boroughs of New York City, and one district on Long Island. In each judicial district outside New York City, an Administrator (or Administrative Judge if a judge) is responsible for supervising all courts and agencies, while inside New York City an Administrator (or Administrative Judge) supervises each major court. Administrators are assisted by Supervising Judges who are responsible in the on-site management of the trial courts, including court caseloads, personnel, and budget administration, and each manage a particular type of court within a county or judicial district. The Administrator is also assisted by the District Executive and support staff. The district administrative offices are responsible for personnel, purchasing, budgets, revenue, computer automation, court interpreters, court security, and case management. Opinions of the New York trial courts are published selectively in the &quot;Miscellaneous Reports&quot;.

==Judges==
A judge of the New York Supreme Court is titled a &quot;justice&quot;. 

===Number of justices and assignments===
The number of justices of the Supreme Court in each New York Supreme Court judicial district (including justices assigned to the Appellate Division) is set forth by the New York State Constitution. Once a decade, the state Legislature may increase the number of justices in any judicial district, but Article VI of the state Constitution sets a population-based cap on the number of justices in each district, based on census data. As a result of the population-based cap, some areas have overloaded courts. New York City has a cap of 171 justices (and only some of the New York Supreme Court justices in New York City serve in trial parts, with others assigned to the Appellate Division or the Appellate Term). As a result, New York City has too few judges to handle New York City&#x27;s caseload, which is more than 100,000 cases annually; the population-based formula in the state Constitution does not account for the millions of non-resident workers and visitors in the city, nor the 315,000 business associations that operate in the city. Elected New York Supreme Court justices can be moved or temporarily reassigned anywhere in the state, although typically such moves or reassignments are within the judge&#x27;s judicial district.

To address the imbalance, the New York court system designates other courts&#x27; judges (such as those sitting on the lower-level New York City Civil Court, New York City Criminal Court, and New York City Family Court, as well as the statewide New York Court of Claims) as &quot;acting&quot; Supreme Court justices to serve on the New York Supreme Court in New York City. A similar practice is done in the 9th Judicial District (which covers the New York suburban counties of Orange, Dutchess, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam), in which County and Family Court judges have been designated as acting Supreme Court justices, serving part-time on that court. However, this practice also strains the resources of the courts that &quot;lend&quot; justices to the Supreme Court.

===Elections and terms===
Supreme Court justices are elected to 14-year terms. Justices are nominated by judicial district nominating conventions, with judicial delegates themselves elected from assembly districts. Some (political party) county committees play a significant role in their judicial district conventions, for example restricting nomination to those candidates that receive approval from a party screening committee. Sometimes, the parties cross-endorse each other&#x27;s candidates, while at other times they do not and incumbent judges must actively campaign for re-election. Judicial conventions have been criticized as opaque, brief and dominated by county party leaders. In practice, most of the power of selecting justices belongs to local political party organizations, such as the Kings County Democratic County Committee (Brooklyn Democratic Party), which control the delegates. The process was challenged in litigation which ultimately resulted in a U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;N.Y. State Board of Elections v. Lopez Torres&quot; (2008), in which the justices unanimously upheld the constitutionality of New York&#x27;s judicial election system.

===Mandatory retirement age===
Under state law, New York Supreme Court justices have a mandatory retirement age: a justice&#x27;s term ends, even if his or her 14-year term has not yet expired, at the end of the calendar year in which the justice reaches the age of 70. However, an elected Supreme Court Justice may apply for a &quot;certification&quot; from the Office of Court Administration (OCA) to continue in office, without having to be re-elected, for three two-year periods, until final retirement at the end of the year in which the Justice turns 76. A judge applying for certification to continue to serve must pass cognitive tests, but OCA is not required to grant certification even if judges are capable. In 2020, for example, OCA denied certification to 46 of the 49 judges who applied for it, citing budget cuts and a hiring freeze. 

These additional six years of service are available only for elected Supreme Court Justices, not for &quot;Acting&quot; Justices whose election or appointments were to lower courts.

A referendum to increase the retirement age to 80 for Supreme Court and Court of Appeals judges was defeated by New York voters in 2013.

==History==
The New York Supreme Court is the oldest Supreme Court with general original jurisdiction. It was established as the Supreme Court of Judicature by the Province of New York on May 6, 1691. That court was continued by the State of New York after independence was declared in 1776. It became the New York Supreme Court under the New York Constitutional Convention of 1846.

In November 2004, the court system merged the operations of two separate criminal courts—the Bronx County Criminal Court and the Criminal Term of Bronx County Supreme Court—into a single trial court of criminal jurisdiction known as the Bronx Criminal Division.

<text>An improvised explosive device (IED) is a bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery shell, attached to a detonating mechanism. IEDs are commonly used as roadside bombs, or homemade bombs. 

The term &quot;IED&quot; was coined by the British Army during the Northern Ireland conflict to refer to booby traps made by the IRA, and entered common use in the U.S. during the Iraq War.

IEDs are generally utilized in terrorist operations or in asymmetric unconventional warfare or urban warfare by insurgent guerrillas or commando forces in a theatre of operations. In the Iraq War (2003–2011), insurgents used IEDs extensively against U.S.-led forces, and by the end of 2007, IEDs were responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq. They were also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the 2001–2021 Afghanistan War.

IEDs were also used frequently by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka during the Sri Lankan Civil War, by the Chechen insurgency following the Second Chechen War, and by Ambazonian separatists in the ongoing Anglophone Crisis.

==Background==
An IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, facilitating another type of attack. IEDs may incorporate military or commercially sourced explosives, and often combine both types, or they may otherwise be made with homemade explosives (HME). An HME lab refers to a Homemade Explosive Lab, or the physical location where the devices are crafted.

An IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED designed for use against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a shaped charge that creates an explosively formed penetrator. IEDs are extremely diverse in design and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, penetrators, and explosive loads.
Antipersonnel IEDs typically also contain fragmentation-generating objects such as nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast pressure alone could. In the conflicts of the 21st century, anti-personnel improvised explosive devices (IED) have partially replaced conventional or military landmines as the source of injury to dismounted (pedestrian) soldiers and civilians. These injuries were reported in &quot;BMJ Open&quot; to be far worse with IEDs than with landmines resulting in multiple limb amputations and lower body mutilation. This combination of injuries has been given the name &quot;Dismounted Complex Blast Injury&quot; and is thought to be the worst survivable injury ever seen in war.

IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infrared or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a daisy chain to attack a convoy of vehicles spread out along a roadway.

IEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to detonate, and in some cases, they detonate on either the maker or the placer of the device. Some groups, however, have been known to produce sophisticated devices constructed with components scavenged from conventional munitions and standard consumer electronics components, such as mobile phones, consumer-grade two-way radios, washing machine timers, pagers, or garage door openers. The sophistication of an IED depends on the training of the designer and the tools and materials available.

IEDs may use artillery shells or conventional high-explosive charges as their explosive load as well as homemade explosives. However, the threat exists that toxic chemical, biological, or radioactive (dirty bomb) material may be added to a device, thereby creating other life-threatening effects beyond the shrapnel, concussive blasts and fire normally associated with bombs. Chlorine liquid has been added to IEDs in Iraq, producing clouds of chlorine gas.

A vehicle-borne IED, or VBIED, is a military term for a car bomb or truck bomb but can be any type of transportation such as a bicycle, motorcycle, donkey (), etc. They are typically employed by insurgents, in particular ISIS, and can carry a relatively large payload. They can also be detonated from a remote location. VBIEDs can create additional shrapnel through the destruction of the vehicle itself and use vehicle fuel as an incendiary weapon. The act of a person&#x27;s being in this vehicle and detonating it is known as an SVBIED suicide.

Of increasing popularity among insurgent forces in Iraq is the house-borne IED, or HBIED, from the common military practice of clearing houses; insurgents rig an entire house to detonate and collapse shortly after a clearing squad has entered.

===By warhead===
The &quot;Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms&quot; (JCS Pub 1-02) includes two definitions for improvised devices: improvised explosive devices (IED) and improvised nuclear device (IND). These definitions address the &quot;Nuclear&quot; and &quot;Explosive&quot; in &quot;CBRNe&quot;. That leaves chemical, biological and radiological undefined. Four definitions have been created to build on the structure of the JCS definition. Terms have been created to standardize the language of first responders and members of the military and to correlate the operational picture.

====Explosive====
A device placed or fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy, incapacitate, harass, or distract. It may incorporate military stores, but is normally devised from non-military components.

====Explosively formed penetrator/projectiles (EFPs)====
IEDs have been deployed in the form of explosively formed projectiles (EFP), a special type of shaped charge that is effective at long standoffs from the target (50 meters or more), however they are not accurate at long distances. This is because of how they are produced. The large &quot;slug&quot; projected from the explosion has no stabilization because it has no tail fins and it does not spin like a bullet from a rifle. Without this stabilization the trajectory can not be accurately determined beyond 50 meters. An EFP is essentially a cylindrical shaped charge with a machined concave metal disc (often copper) in front, pointed inward. The force of the shaped charge turns the disc into a high velocity slug, capable of penetrating the armor of most vehicles in Iraq.

====Directionally focused charges====
Directionally focused charges (also known as directionally focused fragmentary charges depending on the construction) are very similar to EFPs, with the main difference being that the top plate is usually flat and not concave. It also is not made with machined copper but much cheaper cast or cut metal. When made for fragmentation, the contents of the charge are usually nuts, bolts, ball bearings and other similar shrapnel products and explosive. If it only consists of the flat metal plate, it is known as a platter charge, serving a similar role as an EFP with reduced effect but easier construction.

====Chemical====
A device incorporating the toxic attributes of chemical materials designed to result in the dispersal of toxic chemical materials for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon.

====Biological====
A device incorporating biological materials designed to result in the dispersal of vector borne biological material for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population.

====Incendiary====
A device making use of exothermic chemical reactions designed to result in the rapid spread of fire for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population or it may be used with the intent of gaining a tactical advantage. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing weapon. A common type of this is the Molotov cocktail.

====Radiological====
A speculative device incorporating radioactive materials designed to result in the dispersal of radioactive material for the purpose of area denial and economic damage, and/or for the purpose of creating a primary patho-physiological toxic effect (morbidity and mortality), or secondary psychological effect (causing fear and behavior modification) on a larger population. Such devices may be fabricated in a completely improvised manner or may be an improvised modification to an existing nuclear weapon. Also called a Radiological Dispersion Device (RDD) or &quot;dirty bomb&quot;.

====Nuclear====
Improvised nuclear device of most likely gun-type or implosion-type.

===By delivery mechanism===

====Car====

A vehicle may be laden with explosives, set to explode by remote control or by a passenger/driver, commonly known as a car bomb or vehicle-borne IED (VBIED, pronounced &quot;vee-bid&quot;). On occasion the driver of the car bomb may have been coerced into delivery of the vehicle under duress, a situation known as a proxy bomb. Distinguishing features are low-riding vehicles with excessive weight, vehicles with only one passenger, and ones where the interior of the vehicles look as if they have been stripped down and built back up. Car bombs can carry thousands of pounds of explosives and may be augmented with shrapnel to increase fragmentation.

ISIS has used truck bombs with devastating effects.

====Boat (WBIED)====
Water-borne Improvised Explosive Devices (WBIED), i.e. boats carrying explosives, can be used against ships and areas connected to water. 

An early example of this type was the Japanese Shinyo suicide boats during World War II. The boats were filled with explosives and attempted to ram Allied ships, sometimes successfully, having sunk or severely damaged several American ships by war&#x27;s end. Suicide bombers used a boat-borne IED to attack the USS Cole; US and UK troops have also been killed by boat-borne IEDs in Iraq. The Tamil Tigers Sea Tigers have also been known to use SWBIEDs during the Sri Lankan Civil War.

WBIEDs have been used in the Red Sea.

====Animal====
Monkeys and war pigs were used as incendiaries around 1000 AD. More famously the &quot;anti-tank dog&quot; and &quot;bat bomb&quot; were developed during World War II. In recent times, a two-year-old child and seven other people were killed by explosives strapped to a horse in the town of Chita in Colombia. The carcasses of certain animals were also used to conceal explosive devices by the Iraqi insurgency.

====Collar====

IEDs strapped to the necks of farmers have been used on at least three occasions by guerrillas in Colombia, as a way of extortion. American pizza delivery man Brian Douglas Wells was killed in 2003 by an explosive fastened to his neck, purportedly under duress from the maker of the bomb. In 2011 a schoolgirl in Sydney, Australia had a suspected collar bomb attached to her by an attacker in her home. The device was removed by police after a ten-hour operation and proved to be a hoax.

====Suicide====
Suicide bombing usually refers to an individual wearing explosives and detonating them to kill others including themselves, the bomber will conceal explosives on and around their person, commonly using a vest, and will use a timer or some other trigger to detonate the explosives. The logic behind such attacks is the belief that an IED delivered by a human has a greater chance of achieving success than any other method of attack. In addition, there is the psychological impact of child soldiers prepared to deliberately sacrifice themselves for their cause.

====Surgically implanted====

In May 2012 American counter-terrorism officials leaked their acquisition of documents describing the preparation and use of surgically implanted improvised explosive devices.
The devices were designed to evade detection.
The devices were described as containing no metal, so they could not be detected by X-rays.

Security officials referred to bombs being surgically implanted into suicide bombers&#x27; &quot;love handles&quot;.

According to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; UK security officials at MI-6 asserted that female bombers could travel undetected carrying the explosive chemicals in otherwise standard breast implants. The bomber would blow up the implanted explosives by injecting a chemical trigger.

====Robot====
Robots could also be used to carry explosives. First such documented case was during the aftermath of 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers when a bomb disposal robot was used to deliver explosives to kill Micah Xavier Johnson, who was hiding in a place inaccessible to police snipers. As well, drones carrying explosives were used in a suspected assassination attempt against Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in 2018.

====Tunnel====
ISIS
and Al-Nusra have used bombs detonated in tunnels dug under targets.

====Improvised rocket====
In 2008, rocket-propelled IEDs, dubbed &quot;Improvised Rocket Assisted Munitions&quot;, &quot;Improvised Rocket Assisted Mortars&quot; and &quot;(IRAM)&quot; by the military, came to be employed in numbers against U.S. forces in Iraq. They have been described as propane tanks packed with explosives and powered by 107 mm rockets. They are similar to some Provisional IRA barrack buster mortars.
New types of IRAMs including Volcano IRAM and Elephant Rockets, are used during the Syrian Civil War.

==== Improvised mortar ====
Improvised mortars have been used by many insurgent groups including during the civil war in Syria and Boko Haram insurgency. IRA used improvised mortars called barrack busters.

Improvised artillery including &quot;hell cannons&quot; are used by rebel forces during Syrian Civil War.

===By trigger mechanism===

====Wire====
Command-wire improvised, explosive devices (CWIED) use an electrical firing cable that affords the user complete control over the device right up until the moment of initiation.

====Radio====
The trigger for a radio-controlled improvised explosive device (RCIED) is controlled by radio link. The device is constructed so that the receiver is connected to an electrical firing circuit and the transmitter operated by the perpetrator at a distance. A signal from the transmitter causes the receiver to trigger a firing pulse that operates the switch. Usually the switch fires an initiator; however, the output may also be used to remotely arm an explosive circuit. Often the transmitter and receiver operate on a matched coding system that prevents the RCIED from being initiated by spurious radio frequency signals or jamming. An RCIED can be triggered from any number of different radio-frequency based mechanisms including handheld remote control transmitters, car alarms, wireless door bells, cell phones, pagers and portable two-way radios, including those designed for the UHF PMR446, FRS, and GMRS services.

====Mobile phone====
A radio-controlled IED (RCIED) incorporating a mobile phone that is modified and connected to an electrical firing circuit. Mobile phones operate in the UHF band in line of sight with base transceiver station (BTS) antennae sites. In the common scenario, receipt of a paging signal by phone is sufficient to initiate the IED firing circuit.

====Victim-operated====
Victim-operated improvised explosive devices (VOIED), also known as booby traps, are designed to function upon contact with a victim. VOIED switches are often well hidden from the victim or disguised as innocuous everyday objects. They are operated by means of movement. Switching methods include tripwire, pressure mats, spring-loaded release, push, pull or tilt. Common forms of VOIED include the under-vehicle IED (UVIED), improvised landmines, and mail bombs.

====Infrared====
The British accused Iran and Hezbollah of teaching Iraqi fighters to use infrared light beams to trigger IEDs. As the occupation forces became more sophisticated in interrupting radio signals around their convoys, the insurgents adapted their triggering methods. In some cases, when a more advanced method was disrupted, the insurgents regressed to using uninterruptible means, such as hard wires from the IED to detonator; however, this method is much harder to effectively conceal. It later emerged however, that these &quot;advanced&quot; IEDs were actually old IRA technology. The infrared beam method was perfected by the IRA in the early 1990s after it acquired the technology from a botched undercover British Army operation. Many of the IEDs being used against the invading coalition forces in Iraq were originally developed by the British Army who unintentionally passed the information on to the IRA. The IRA taught their techniques to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and the knowledge spread to Iraq.

==Counterefforts==

Counter-IED efforts are done primarily by military, law enforcement, diplomatic, financial, and intelligence communities and involve a comprehensive approach to countering the threat networks that employ IEDs, not just efforts to defeat the devices themselves.

===Detection and disarmament===
Because the components of these devices are being used in a manner not intended by their manufacturer, and because the method of producing the explosion is limited only by the science and imagination of the perpetrator, it is not possible to follow a step-by-step guide to detect and disarm a device that an individual has only recently developed. As such, explosive ordnance disposal (IEDD) operators must be able to fall back on their extensive knowledge of the first principles of explosives and ammunition, to try and deduce what the perpetrator has done, and only then to render it safe and dispose of or exploit the device.

Beyond this, as the stakes increase and IEDs are emplaced not only to achieve the direct effect, but to deliberately target IEDD operators and cordon personnel, the IEDD operator needs to have a deep understanding of tactics to ensure they are neither setting up any of their team or the cordon troops for an attack, nor walking into one themselves. The presence of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) material in an IED requires additional precautions. As with other missions, the EOD operator provides the area commander with an assessment of the situation and of support needed to complete the mission.

Military and law enforcement personnel from around the world have developed a number of render-safe procedures (RSPs) to deal with IEDs. RSPs may be developed as a result of direct experience with devices or by applied research designed to counter the threat. The supposed effectiveness of IED jamming systems, including vehicle- and personally-mounted systems, has caused IED technology to essentially regress to command-wire detonation methods. These are physical connections between the detonator and explosive device and cannot be jammed. However, these types of IEDs are more difficult to emplace quickly, and are more readily detected.

Military forces and law enforcement from India, Canada, United Kingdom, Israel, Spain, and the United States are at the forefront of counter-IED efforts, as all have direct experience in dealing with IEDs used against them in conflict or terrorist attacks. From the research and development side, programs such as the new Canadian Unmanned Systems Challenge will bring student groups together to invent an unmanned device to both locate IEDs and pinpoint the insurgents.

==Historical use==
The fougasse was improvised for centuries, eventually inspiring factory-made land mines. Ernst Jünger mentions in his war memoir the systematic use of IEDs and booby traps to cover the retreat of German troops at the Somme region during World War I. Another early example of coordinated large-scale use of IEDs was the Belarusian Rail War launched by Belarusian guerrillas against the Germans during World War II. Both command-detonated and delayed-fuse IEDs were used to derail thousands of German trains during 1943–1944.

===Afghanistan===

Starting six months before the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR on 27 December 1979, the Afghan Mujahideen were supplied by the CIA, among others, with large quantities of military supplies. Among those supplies were many types of anti-tank mines. The insurgents often removed the explosives from several foreign anti-tank mines, and combined the explosives in tin cooking-oil cans for a more powerful blast. By combining the explosives from several mines and placing them in tin cans, the insurgents made them more powerful, but sometimes also easier to detect by Soviet sappers using mine detectors. After an IED was detonated, the insurgents often used direct-fire weapons such as machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades to continue the attack.

Afghan insurgents operating far from the border with Pakistan did not have a ready supply of foreign anti-tank mines. They preferred to make IEDs from Soviet unexploded ordnance. The devices were rarely triggered by pressure fuses. They were almost always remotely detonated. Since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the Taliban and its supporters have used IEDs against NATO and Afghan military and civilian vehicles. This has become the most common method of attack against NATO forces, with IED attacks increasing consistently year on year.

A brigade commander said that sniffer dogs are the most reliable way of detecting IEDs. However, statistical evidence gathered by the US Army Maneuver Support Center at Fort Leonard Wood, MO shows that the dogs are not the most effective means of detecting IEDs. The U.S. Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division was the first unit to introduce explosive detection dogs in southern Afghanistan. In less than two years the dogs discovered 15 tons of illegal munitions, IED&#x27;s, and weapons.

In July 2012 it was reported that &quot;sticky bombs&quot;, magnetically adhesive IED&#x27;s that were prevalent in the Iraq War, showed up in Afghanistan. By 2021 there was at least one sticky bomb attack a day in Kabul. They are used in both traditional assassinations and targeted killings and as terror weapons against the population at large.

In November 2013 one of the largest IEDs constructed was intercepted near Gardez City in Eastern Afghanistan. The 61,000 pounds of explosives was hidden under what appeared to be piles of wood. By comparison, the truck bomb that all but razed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 168 people in 1995 weighed less than 5,000 pounds. A United States Army Corps of Engineers officer assigned to the nearby FOB Lightning analyzed the potential blast damage, which resulted in closing FOB Goode due to its proximity to the highway.

ISAF troops stationed in Afghanistan and other IED prone areas of operation would commonly &quot;BIP&quot; (blow in place) IED&#x27;s and other explosives that were considered too dangerous to defuse.

===Egypt===
IEDs are being used by insurgents against government forces during the insurgency in Egypt (2013–present) and the Sinai insurgency.

===India===
IEDs are increasingly being used by Maoists in India.

On 13 July 2011, three IEDs were used by the Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir to carry out a coordinated attack on the city of Mumbai, killing 19 people and injuring 130 more.

On 21 February 2013, two IEDs were used to carry out bombings in the Indian city of Hyderabad. The bombs exploded in Dilsukhnagar, a crowded shopping area of the city, within 150 metres of each other.

On 17 April 2013, two kilos of explosives used in Bangalore bomb blast at Malleshwaram area, leaving 16 injured and no fatalities. Intelligence sources have said the bomb was an Improvised Explosive Device or IED.

On 21 May 2014, Indinthakarai village supporters of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant were targeted by opponents using over half a dozen crude &quot;country-made bombs&quot;. It was further reported that there had been at least four similar bombings in Tamil Nadu during the preceding year.

On 28 December 2014, a minor explosion took place near the Coconut Grove restaurant at Church Street in Bangalore on Sunday around 8:30 pm. One woman was killed and another injured in the blast.

During the 2016 Pathankot attack, several casualties came from IEDs.

On 14 February 2019 in 2019 Pulwama attack, several casualties were reported due to IED blast.

On 29 October 2023, a series of IED explosions were used to kill 2 attendees at a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Convention in Kalamassery, India.

===Iraq===

In the 2003–2011 Iraq War, IEDs have been used extensively against Coalition forces and by the end of 2007 they have been responsible for at least 64% of Coalition deaths in Iraq.

Since the detonation of the first IED in Iraq in 2003, more than 81,000 IED attacks have occurred in the country, killing and wounding 21,200 Americans.

Beginning in July 2003, the Iraqi insurgency used IEDs to target invading coalition vehicles. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, 64% of U.S. deaths in Iraq occurred due to IEDs. A French study showed that in Iraq, from March 2003 to November 2006, on a global deaths in the US-led invading coalition soldiers, were caused by IEDs, i.e. 41%. That is to say more than in the &quot;normal fights&quot; (1027 dead, 34%). Insurgents now use the bombs to target not only invading coalition vehicles but Iraqi police as well.

Common locations for placing these bombs on the ground include animal carcasses, soft drink cans, and boxes. Typically, they explode underneath or to the side of the vehicle to cause the maximum amount of damage. However, as vehicle armour was improved on military vehicles, insurgents began placing IEDs in elevated positions such as on road signs, utility poles, or trees, to hit less protected areas.

IEDs in Iraq may be made with artillery or mortar shells or with varying amounts of bulk or homemade explosives. Early during the Iraq war, the bulk explosives were often obtained from stored munitions bunkers to include stripping landmines of their explosives.

Despite the increased armor, IEDs are killing military personnel and civilians with greater frequency. May 2007 was the deadliest month for IED attacks thus far, with a reported 89 of the 129 invading coalition casualties coming from an IED attack. According to the Pentagon, 250,000 tons (out of 650,000 tons total) of Iraqi heavy ordnance were looted, providing a large supply of ammunition for the insurgents.

In October 2005, the UK government charged that Iran was supplying insurgents with the technological know-how to make shaped charge IEDs. Both Iranian and Iraqi government officials denied the allegations.

During the Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017), ISIL has made extensive use of suicide VBIEDs, often driven by children, elderly and disabled.

On August 27, 2023, Israeli security forces successfully foiled an attempt to smuggle Iranian-made explosives into Israel from Jordan. The thwarted smuggling operation in the Jordan Valley aimed to supply terror groups in the West Bank with explosives. Counter-smuggling efforts along the border have led to increased seizures of weapons and explosive devices.

=== Ireland and the United Kingdom ===
From 1912-1913, the Suffragettes utilised IEDs in the Suffragette bombing and arson campaign.

Throughout the Troubles, the Provisional Irish Republican Army made extensive use of IEDs in their 1969–97 campaign, much of which were made in the Republic of Ireland. They used barrack buster mortars and remote-controlled IEDs. Members of the IRA developed and counter-developed devices and tactics. IRA bombs became highly sophisticated, featuring anti-handling devices such as a mercury tilt switch or microswitches. These devices would detonate the bomb if it was moved in any way. Typically, the safety-arming device used was a clockwork Memopark timer, which armed the bomb up to 60 minutes after it was placed by completing an electrical circuit supplying power to the anti-handling device. Depending on the particular design (e.g., boobytrapped briefcase or car bomb) an independent electrical circuit supplied power to a conventional timer set for the intended time delay, e.g. 40 minutes. However, some electronic delays developed by IRA technicians could be set to accurately detonate a bomb weeks after it was hidden, which is what happened in the Brighton hotel bomb attack of 1984. Initially, bombs were detonated either by timer or by simple command wire. Later, bombs could be detonated by radio control. Initially, simple servos from radio-controlled aircraft were used to close the electrical circuit and supply power to the detonator. After the British developed jammers, IRA technicians introduced devices that required a sequence of pulsed radio codes to arm and detonate them. These were harder to jam.

The IRA as well as Ulster loyalist paramilitaries have also utilized less sophisticated devices, such as homemade grenades crudely thrown at the target. These are sometimes called &quot;blast bombs&quot;.

Roadside bombs were extensively used by the IRA. Typically, a roadside bomb was placed in a drain or culvert along a rural road and detonated by remote control when British security forces vehicles were passing, as with the case of the 1979 Warrenpoint ambush. As a result of the use of these bombs, the British military stopped transport by road in areas such as South Armagh, and used helicopter transport instead to avoid the danger.

Most IEDs used commercial or homemade explosives made in the Republic of Ireland, with ingredients such as gelignite and ANFO either stolen in construction sites or provided for by supporters in the South, although the use of Semtex-H smuggled in from Libya in the 1980s was also common from the mid-1980s onward. Bomb Disposal teams from 321 EOD manned by Ammunition Technicians were deployed in those areas to deal with the IED threat. The IRA also used secondary devices to catch British reinforcements sent in after an initial blast as occurred in the Warrenpoint Ambush. Between 1970 and 2005, the IRA detonated 19,000 IEDs in the Northern Ireland and Britain, an average of one every 17 hours for three and a half decades, arguably making it &quot;the biggest terrorist bombing campaign in history&quot;. 

In the early 1970s, at the height of the IRA campaign, the British Army unit tasked with rendering safe IEDs, 321 EOD, sustained significant casualties while engaged in bomb disposal operations. This mortality rate was far higher than other high risk occupations such as deep sea diving, and a careful review was made of how men were selected for EOD operations. The review recommended bringing in psychometric testing of soldiers to ensure those chosen had the correct mental preparation for high risk bomb disposal duties.

The IRA came up with ever more sophisticated designs and deployments of IEDs. Booby Trap or Victim Operated IEDs (VOIEDs), became commonplace. The IRA engaged in an ongoing battle to gain the upper hand in electronic warfare with remote controlled devices. The rapid changes in development led 321 EOD to employ specialists from DERA (now Dstl, an agency of the MOD), the Royal Signals, and Military Intelligence. This approach by the British army to fighting the IRA in Northern Ireland led to the development and use of most of the modern weapons, equipment and techniques now used by EOD Operators throughout the rest of the world today.

The bomb disposal operations were led by Ammunition Technicians and Ammunition Technical Officers from 321 EOD, and were trained at the Felix Centre at the Army School of Ammunition.

===Israel===
IEDs have been used in many attacks by Palestinian militants and continue to be used in recent attacks.

===Lebanon===
The Lebanese National Resistance Front, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, other resistance groups in Lebanon, and later Hezbollah, made extensive use of IEDs to resist Israeli forces after Israel&#x27;s invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Israel withdrew from Beirut, Northern Lebanon, and Mount Lebanon in 1985, whilst maintaining its occupation of Southern Lebanon. Hezbollah frequently used IEDs to attack Israeli military forces in this area up until the Israeli withdrawal, and the end of the invasion of Lebanon in May 2000.

One such bomb killed Israeli Brigadier General Erez Gerstein on 28 February 1999, the highest-ranking Israeli to die in Lebanon since Yekutiel Adam&#x27;s death in 1982.

Also in the 2006 War in Lebanon, a Merkava Mark II tank was hit by a pre-positioned Hezbollah IED, killing all 4 IDF servicemen on board, the first of two IEDs to damage a Merkava tank.

===Libya===
Homemade IEDs are used extensively during the post-civil war violence in Libya, mostly in the city of Benghazi against police stations, cars or foreign embassies.

===Nepal===
IEDs were also widely used in the 10-years long civil war of the Maoists in Nepal, ranging from those bought from illicit groups in India and China, to self-made devices. Typically used devices were pressure cooker bombs, socket bombs, pipe bombs, bucket bombs, etc. The devices were used more for the act of terrorizing the urban population rather than for fatal causes, placed in front of governmental offices, street corners or road sides. Mainly, the home-made IEDs were responsible for destruction of majority of structures targeted by the Maoists and assisted greatly in spreading terror among the public.

===Nigeria===
Boko Haram are using IEDs during their insurgency.

===Pakistan===
Taliban and other insurgent groups use IEDs against police, military, security forces, and civilian targets.

=== Russia ===
IEDs have also been popular in Chechnya, where Russian forces were engaged in fighting with rebel elements. While no concrete statistics are available on this matter, bombs have accounted for many Russian deaths in both the First Chechen War (1994–1996) and the Second (1999–2009).

=== Somalia ===
Al Shabaab is using IEDs during the Somali Civil War.

=== Syria ===

During the Syrian Civil War, militant insurgents were using IEDs to attack buses, cars, trucks, tanks and military convoys. Additionally, the Syrian Air Force has used barrel bombs to attack targets in cities and other areas. Such barrel bombs consist of barrels filled with high explosives, oil, and shrapnel, and are dropped from helicopters.

Along with mines and IEDs, ISIL also used VBIEDs in Syria, including during 2017 Aleppo suicide car bombing. See also: Improvised artillery in the Syrian civil war.

===Uganda===
On 16 November 2021, suicide bombers set off two powerful explosions in the center of Uganda&#x27;s capital Kampala during rush hour in an attack later claimed by Islamic State. There have been a number of bomb explosions in 2021. In October, a 20-year-old waitress was killed after a device, left in a shopping bag, detonated in a bar in the city. Days later several people were injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a bus near Kampala.

===United States===

In the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols built an IED with ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and stolen commercial explosives in a rental truck, with sandbags used to concentrate the explosive force in the desired direction. McVeigh detonated it next to the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killing 168 people, 19 of whom were children.

High school students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold used multiple IEDs during the Columbine High School massacre on 20 April 1999, including two large propane bombs that were placed in the cafeteria, powerful enough to kill or injure everyone inside the room, along with pipe bombs, Molotov cocktails, and also two car bombs, designed to attack first responders and news reporters responding to the initial bombing. Both propane bombs and both car bombs failed to detonate correctly. They then went on to shoot and kill 13 people before committing suicide. If all bombs detonated, there could have been hundreds killed in the massacre, but nobody was injured by any of the explosives during the massacre. The pair had planned to exceed the death count during the Oklahoma City bombing four years earlier.

In January 2011, a shaped pipe bomb was discovered and defused at a Martin Luther King Jr. memorial march in Spokane, Washington. The FBI said that the bomb was specifically designed to cause maximum harm as the explosive device was, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, packed with fishing weights covered in rat poison, and may have been racially motivated. No one was injured during the event.

On 15 April 2013, as the annual Boston Marathon race was concluding, two bombs were detonated seconds apart close to the finish line. Initial FBI response indicated suspicion of IED pressure cooker bombs.

On 17–19 September 2016, several explosions occurred in Manhattan and New Jersey. The sources of the explosions were all found to be IEDs of various types, such as pressure cooker bombs and pipe bombs

Many IED-related arrests are made each year in circumstances where the plot was foiled before the device was deployed, or the device exploded but no one was injured.

A number of deaths and property damage occurring during gender reveal parties have been caused by the detonation of improvised explosive devices. These include the 2017 Sawmill Fire, which was started by the detonation of a mass of tannerite intended to disperse coloured powder, and an incident in 2019 where an IED similarly designed to release powder exploded in a manner similar to a pipe bomb, killing a 56-year-old woman after shrapnel struck her in the head.

===Ukraine===
IEDs are in use in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and have also been used there for assassinations.

===Vietnam===
IEDs were used during the Vietnam War by the Viet Cong against land- and river-borne vehicles as well as personnel. They were commonly constructed using materials from unexploded American ordnance. Thirty-three percent of U.S. casualties in Vietnam and twenty-eight percent of deaths were officially attributed to mines; these figures include losses caused by both IEDs and commercially manufactured mines.

===Yemen===
Houthis are using IEDs against Saudi-led coalition and Hadi&#x27;s forces during Yemeni Civil War (2015–present), Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and Saudi–Yemeni border conflict.

Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL in Yemen are also known to use IEDs.

==In popular culture==
The film The Hurt Locker follows an Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal team who are targeted by insurgents and shows their psychological reactions to the stress of combat.

<doc id="265114" wikidata="Q379286" url="?curid=265114" title="Naked Lunch">
<text>Naked Lunch (first published as The Naked Lunch) is a 1959 antinovel by American author William S. Burroughs. The antinovel does not follow a clear linear plot, but is instead structured as a series of non-chronological &quot;routines&quot;. Many of these routines follow William Lee, an opioid addict who travels to the surreal city of Interzone and begins working for the organization &quot;Islam Inc.&quot;

Burroughs wrote &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; while living in the Tangier International Zone, which inspired the book&#x27;s Interzone setting. There, he witnessed escalating tensions between European powers and the Moroccan Nationalist Movement, which are reflected in Interzone&#x27;s fictional political struggles. Burroughs also struggled with opioid addiction, which the novel describes extensively, although critics disagree whether the novel uses opioids as a metaphor for broader forms of control.

The novel was highly controversial for its depictions of drug use, sadomasochism, and body horror, including a famous description of a man&#x27;s talking anus taking over his body. The book was considered obscene by the United States Postal Service, the state of Massachusetts, and the city of Los Angeles, each leading to separate legal challenges. In the Massachusetts trial, now recognized as a landmark censorship case, defense attorney Edward de Grazia called writers such as Allen Ginsberg, John Ciardi, and Norman Mailer to testify to the book&#x27;s literary merit. Although the court initially ruled the book was in fact obscene, this decision was overturned by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which allowed the book to be sold.

&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; has received a divided critical response. The book&#x27;s admirers have compared it to the satires of Jonathan Swift and the religious works of Dante Aligheri and Hieronymous Bosch. Its detractors have compared it to pornography, often calling it monotonous and boring. The book has been considered dystopian science fiction, postmodern, parodic, and picaresque. Its experimental techniques have been highly influential on rock music and the cyberpunk genre. &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is considered one of the defining texts of the Beat Generation.

==Background==
In 1923, European powers established the Tangier International Zone in Northern Morocco. To ensure the area&#x27;s neutrality, the Zone was overseen by representatives from multiple European nations alongside the sultan of Morocco. This government was unable to effectively regulate drugs or prostitution, and American residents were not subject to Moroccan laws.

William S. Burroughs moved to the Tangier International Zone in 1954, shortly after the publication of his first novel &quot;Junkie&quot;. Burroughs was attracted by the zone&#x27;s reputation for allowing drug use and homosexuality, as portrayed in the works of Paul Bowles, and declared his intention to &quot;steep myself in vice&quot;. In Tangier, Burroughs became severely addicted to Eukodal, eventually using the drug every two hours. He had previously been addicted to heroin while writing &quot;Junkie&quot;. Burroughs also began a sexual relationship with a teenage boy named Kiki, which would last until Kiki&#x27;s death in September 1957.

In May 1954, Burroughs began work on what would become &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. He mailed his early drafts to his friends Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac, who were the core members of the Beat generation along with Burroughs himself. In a letter to Ginsberg, Burroughs explicitly identified Interzone as a stand-in for the Tangier International Zone. However, the novel&#x27;s Interzone is also closely related to the fictional &quot;Composite city&quot; Burroughs described in his earlier &quot;The Yage Letters&quot;, which he wrote before visiting Tangier.

While living in Tangier, Burroughs witnessed violent clashes between Moroccan nationalists and French authorities over its political status. Burroughs did not take a strong stance on the conflict, at one point calling himself &quot;the most politically neutral man in Africa&quot;. He defended the riots as just and denounced the brutality of European imperialism, but worried about the impact of Islamic rule on individual freedom.

In 1955, Burroughs attempted to quit Eukodol by checking himself into Benchimol Hospital, where his experiences helped inspire the character of Dr Benway. In 1956, Burroughs successfully mitigated his drug dependency using apomorphine. Burroughs replaced his opioid use with cannabis, and continued writing sections of the novel and mailing them to Ginsberg. Burroughs later stated he &quot;wrote nearly the whole of Naked Lunch on cannabis&quot;.

In early 1957, Kerouac and Ginsberg visited Burroughs in Tangier, where they helped Burroughs type his manuscript and assemble the fragments he had mailed them over the years. However, Ginsberg worried the lack of character development or a clear narrative would make the book impossible to publish. That summer, Burroughs spent three weeks in Copenhagen, which inspired additional sections of the novel set in &quot;Freeland&quot;.

==Publication history and legal challenges==

In 1957, Allen Ginsberg submitted the &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; manuscript to Olympia Press, which had a reputation for publishing controversial novels such as &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; and &quot;Lolita&quot;. Olympia rejected the manuscript, arguing that it was inaccessible and lacked structure. Ginsberg then sent the manuscript to Irving Rosenthal, editor of the &quot;Chicago Review&quot;. Rosenthal published excerpts from the novel in the &quot;Review&quot;&#x27;s Spring 1958 and Autumn 1958 issues. Jack Mabley, a columnist for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, publicly criticized the &quot;Chicago Review&quot; for publishing &quot;obscenity&quot;. In response, the University of Chicago insisted that material from Burroughs and Jack Kerouac could not appear in the upcoming Winter issue. Irving Rosenthal resigned from the &quot;Review&quot; and founded a new literary magazine with Pete Carroll called &quot;Big Table&quot;, which published the suppressed material in its first issue.

===Post Office hearing===

Rosenthal and Carroll planned to mail the first issue of &quot;Big Table&quot; in March 1959. However, the US Post Office considered the magazine obscene, which made it un-mailable under the Comstock laws. On June 4th, 1959, the Post Office launched a formal hearing over &quot;Big Table&quot;&#x27;s obscenity, with a particular focus on Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Ten Episodes from Naked Lunch&quot; and a short story by Jack Keruoac titled &quot;Old Angel Midnight&quot;.

Joel Sprayregen, &quot;Big Table&quot;&#x27;s attorney, advocated for the magazine&#x27;s literary value and insisted it was not obscene under the criteria established in &quot;Roth v. United States&quot;. Pete Carroll, the magazine&#x27;s co-founder, testified that he considered Burroughs a satirist in the tradition of Jonathan Swift and Nathanael West and that his social criticism required vulgar language. William Duvall, the hearing examiner, admitted that Burroughs&#x27; work had some &quot;intelligible satire&quot;, but felt its vulgarity outweighed any literary merit. He ruled that the magazine was in fact obscene and could not be mailed.

In February 1960, &quot;Big Table&quot; filed a federal complaint, arguing that the Post Office&#x27;s decision violated the First Amendment. On June 30, 1960, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois overturned the Post Office&#x27;s findings. The Post Office did not appeal this decision.

===European and American publication===

Inspired by the attention around &quot;Big Table&quot;&#x27;s excerpts, Olympia Press reconsidered its rejection and published the novel. Olympia first published the English-language &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; in France in July 1959.

Grove Press bought the American publication rights, and initially planned to exclude the chapters describing Hassan&#x27;s &quot;Rumpus Room&quot; and A.J.&#x27;s party. Burroughs himself had called those sections &quot;pornographic&quot; and expected they would be cut from a US release, although he also felt they constituted a political argument against capital punishment. Ultimately, Grove decided to publish the novel uncensored, encouraged by the praise the book had received from Norman Mailer and Mary McCarthy. &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; was first published in the US on November 20, 1962, and sold over 14,000 copies in the first 4 months. The US edition included a new appendix by Burroughs titled &quot;Deposition: Testimony Concerning a Sickness&quot;. Burroughs originally wrote the deposition in response to a legal hearing in Paris; the text asserts that he and his novel do not promote the use of drugs. Allen Ginsberg criticized this appendix; he found it overly moralizing and felt Burroughs was avoiding responsibility for his own work.

In 1962, the novel was translated into German, but the publishers intentionally left the most explicit sections in untranslated English. In 1964, it was published in the United Kingdom by John Calder. Calder avoided selling the book to wholesalers and only distributed small print runs at a high price to avoid legal attention, and successfully avoided prosecution.

===Boston Trial===
&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; was banned in Boston, and in January 1965 the novel was tried &quot;in rem&quot;. William Cowin represented the state of Massachusetts, while Edward de Grazia represented Grove Press. Cowin argued the book&#x27;s vulgarity overwhelmed any literary value it had, and that nearly every page contained something obscene. His prosecution emphasized the novel&#x27;s lack of structure, arguing that the most explicit passages could be judged in isolation without considering the book as a whole.

De Grazia called authors and professors to testify about the novel&#x27;s social value and literary merit. Norman Mailer praised Burroughs&#x27; literary talent and defended the novel&#x27;s structure by comparing it to &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. John Ciardi compared the book to a hellfire sermon akin to the works of Dante Alighieri and Hieronymous Bosch and argued its vulgarity was a key part of its effect. He also argued that Burroughs&#x27; uncontrolled writing process did not undermine the novel&#x27;s artistry. Professor Norman Holland agreed with Ciardi&#x27;s interpretation and suggested Augustine might have written a work like &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; if he were still alive. Professor Thomas Jackson also compared the novel&#x27;s explicit passages to Dante Alighieri&#x27;s scenes of cannibalism and scatology, and the novel&#x27;s structure to Ezra Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cantos&quot; and T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;. Paul Hollander argued the novel showcased the depravity of addiction, and John Sturrock suggested it helped readers understand drug-induced psychosis. Allen Ginsberg discussed the book as a metaphor for addiction in general, analyzed connections between the novel&#x27;s depictions of sexuality and drugs, and read his poem &quot;On Burroughs&#x27; Work&quot; from the stand.

In his cross-examinations, William Cowin suggested the novel was anti-Catholic, quizzed the witnesses on whether they could remember its characters, and challenged them to interpret provocative passages like the talking anus scene. He did not call any witnesses to testify against the book.

On March 23, 1965, the court ruled that the novel was in fact obscene. Grove appealed this decision to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. On July 7, 1966, based on new obscenity guidelines from the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Memoirs v. Massachusetts&quot;, the state supreme court overturned the ban, arguing that the testimony had demonstrated the novel&#x27;s social and literary value. In a dissent, Justice Paul Reardon insisted the book was &quot;literary sewage&quot;.

Grove Press exploited the trial as a marketing strategy. Grove compared &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; to &quot;Ulysses&quot;, &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, and &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, which had also been challenged for obscenity, and included transcripts of the court testimonies in a new edition of the book.

===Los Angeles Trial===

On January 28, 1965, the city of Los Angeles tried two people for selling copies of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, arguing they had violated California&#x27;s obscenity statute. Municipal Judge Alan Campbell described the novel as &quot;repugnant&quot; and argued that the chapter describing A.J&#x27;s Party may have qualified as obscene, but found that the book as a whole did not appeal to a &quot;prurient interest&quot; and therefore did not violate the statute. Instead, the judge wrote that &quot;its predominant interest is to complete boredom&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In New York City, William Lee hides from a narcotics agent. He and fellow heroin user Bill Gains agree that law enforcement has become too aggressive and decide to leave New York. Lee travels to Mexico City, then a period of time wandering around Latin America and finally to the surreal city of Interzone.

Lee finds that Interzone is centered around a black market of drugs and giant centipede meat, and its residents include monstrous creatures called Mugwumps. The city is contested by four rival political parties: Liquefactionists, who want to merge everyone into one protoplasmic entity; Senders, who want to control everyone else through telepathy; Divisionists, who subdivide into replicas of themselves; and Factualists, who oppose the other three.

A.J., a Factualist, and Hassan, a Liquefactionist, both support a mysterious organization called Islam Inc. This organization hires Lee to find and recruit the sociopathic Doctor Benway, who previously established a dystopian police state in Annexia. Lee meets Benway in Freeland, where he performs psychological experiments at a &quot;Reconditioning Center&quot;. He agrees to work for Islam Inc. These events are interspersed with non-chronological vignettes about Lee&#x27;s criminal history and drug use, A.J.&#x27;s and Hassan&#x27;s sadomasochistic parties, Benway&#x27;s unethical experiments, other characters&#x27; grotesque transformations, and abstract cut-up sequences with no clear narrative arc.

Back in New York, Lee shoots two police officers who try to arrest him, then calls the police department, which tells him those officers didn&#x27;t exist. Lee considers himself &quot;occluded from space-time&quot; and believes he will no longer interact with the surreal world of Interzone.

The novel ends with an &quot;Atrophied Preface&quot; about the book itself, followed by a sequence of disjointed and impressionistic closing lines.

Burroughs originally used the title &quot;Interzone&quot; for his manuscript. He also considered several titles involving the Sargasso Sea, including &quot;Meet Me in Sargasso&quot; and &quot;The Sargasso Trail&quot;, possibly inspired by William Hope Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;Sargasso Sea Stories&quot;. Burroughs had also referred to Tangier&#x27;s Café Central as &quot;The Sargasso&quot;. Near the end of the novel, the protagonist William Lee describes himself as &quot;occluded from space-time like an eel&#x27;s ass occludes when he stops eating on the way to the Sargasso&quot;.

The final title began as a mistake. Reading aloud from the manuscript for &quot;Queer&quot;, Allen Ginsberg misread the phrase &quot;a leer of nakedlust wrenched&quot; as &quot;a leer of naked lunch&quot;, and Jack Kerouac suggested Burroughs embrace this mangled wording as a title. The title originally referred to a planned three-part work made up of &quot;Junk&quot;, &quot;Queer&quot; and &quot;Yage&quot;, corresponding to his first three manuscripts, before it came to describe the book later published as &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;. Ginsberg would later interpret and expand on the title in his poem &quot;On Burroughs&#x27; Work&quot;, published in the collection &quot;Reality Sandwiches&quot;:

Burroughs himself wrote that &quot;The title means exactly what the words say: &quot;naked&quot; lunch, a frozen moment when everyone sees what is on the end of every fork.&quot; The book was originally published with the title &quot;The Naked Lunch&quot; in Paris in July1959 by Olympia Press. Because of US obscenity laws, a complete American edition (by Grove Press) did not follow until 1962. It was titled &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; and was substantially different from the Olympia Press edition because it was based on an earlier 1958 manuscript in Ginsberg&#x27;s possession. The definite article &quot;the&quot; in the title was never intended by the author, but added by the editors of the Olympia Press 1959 edition. Nonetheless &quot;The Naked Lunch&quot; remained the title used for the 1968 and 1974 Corgi Books editions, and the novel is often known by the alternative name, especially in the United Kingdom where these editions circulated.

==Style==
The majority of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; does not follow any clear structure, chronology, or geography. Instead, it abruptly jumps between a series of loosely-connected episodes (called &quot;routines&quot; by Burroughs), which can be read in any order. These routines are improvisational and often comedic, likely inspired by burlesque and vaudeville. Although the novel is book-ended with a realistic crime story, most of these routines are abstract and surreal, blurring any distinction between fantasy and reality. These routines are sporadically interrupted by parenthetical asides, which comment on or clarify the text. For example, when describing a scene as taking place &quot;...under silent wings of the Anopheles mosquito,&quot; Burroughs adds the parenthetical &quot;(Note: This is not a figure. Anopheles mosquitoes &quot;are&quot; silent.)&quot; Many scenes are described as though on film, using the language of stage directions and editing techniques. This structure builds on that of Burroughs&#x27; incomplete previous novel &quot;Queer&quot;, which began as a conventional narrative before fragmenting into its own series of episodic routines.

Burroughs struggled to organize the routines into a coherent narrative. Brion Gysin, staying in Paris&#x27; Beat Hotel alongside Burroughs, suggested he view the work as a painting observed all at once rather than a traditional novel, which can only be read linearly. Following this advice, Burroughs mostly arranged the book&#x27;s chapters arbitrarily; however, he consciously moved the &quot;Hauser and O&#x27;Brien&quot; chapter to the end, creating a frame narrative in which William Lee evades &quot;the heat&quot; of the law. Lee&#x27;s escape from the agents at the end of the book is portrayed as &quot;spiritual and linguistically radical&quot; freedom. Ron Loewinsohn interprets the book&#x27;s structure as a katabasis. The novel begins with Lee descending into an underground subway, becomes increasingly surreal until Lee reaches the chaotic Hell of Interzone, then ends with Lee emerging back into the world above.

Burroughs&#x27; writing aims to provoke disgust. The novel contains many explicit sexual scenes, emphasizing &quot;sterile, inhuman, malevolent&quot; acts of castration, sodomy, pederasty, and sadomasochism; in particular, the novel features recurring imagery connecting hanging with orgasm. In most cases, the novel portrays sex as exploitative rather than consensual. Many &quot;routines&quot; involve body horror, especially grotesque transformations of humans into insects or amorphous blobs. Many of the novel&#x27;s grotesque images revolve around consumption: people are described as animals like vampire bats and boa constrictors, trade giant centipede meat, and depend on the secretions of monsters called Mugwumps.

===Genre===
Biographer Barry Miles and Burroughs himself have called &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; a Picaresque novel. Other critics consider the book a parody with elements of spy fiction, detective fiction, science fiction, and horror fiction., or a dystopian science fiction novel in the tradition of &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. Marshall McLuhan considered the novel an &quot;anti-Utopia&quot; response to Arthur Rimbaud&#x27;s &quot;Illuminations&quot;. The novel has been described as postmodern and &quot;proto-postmodern&quot;.

The novel is partly autobiographical. The first chapter retells events previously described in Burroughs&#x27; semi-autobiographical first novel &quot;Junkie&quot;. This retelling introduces a new character called &quot;the fruit&quot;, who serves as a parody of the implied reader of &quot;Junkie&quot;; the fruit presents himself as hip and street-smart, but Lee mocks his naivety and plans to sell him catnip by claiming it&#x27;s cannabis. Other routines are also based on Burroughs&#x27; real life, such as Lee&#x27;s interactions with a racist County Clerk and his addiction to Eukodal. Dr. Benway&#x27;s dehumanizing Rehabilitation Center parodies the real-life Lexington Medical Center, which once treated Burroughs for opioid addiction. Loewinsohn interprets Interzone and its political power struggles as &quot;a metaphor for Burroughs himself&quot;, with the political parties reflecting Burroughs&#x27; romantic struggles, his history of self-harm, and his attempts to communicate with his readers.

==Analysis and themes==
The novel describes Interzone&#x27;s four political parties: the Liquefactionists want to physically dissolve and absorb other people, the Senders want to control other people&#x27;s minds via telepathy, and the Divisionists want to endlessly replicate themselves. These parties each represent threats to individualism, and are opposed by the fourth party, the Factualists, to which Lee belongs. The novel is especially critical of the Senders, describing them as &quot;the Human Virus&quot;, interested in control solely for its own sake, and the root cause of &quot;poverty, hatred, war, police-criminals, bureaucracy, [and] insanity&quot;. The novel showcases the struggle between authoritarian, bureaucratic control, epitomized by Dr. Benway, and individual freedom, represented by the Factualist Party. AJ and Lee, both Factualists, fight back against these systems of control with violence and absurd humor. However, Burroughs undermines these characters&#x27; heroism: AJ and Lee work for Islam Inc., which has unclear goals of its own, AJ may be a double agent, and Lee is himself controlled by addiction.

Robin Lydenberg observes that all three non-Factionalist parties represent homogenization and opposition to individual expression. Likewise, Dr. Benway and other scientists attempt to &quot;improve&quot; humanity, but show contempt for the diversity and complexity of human life. The novel describes its characters in behaviorist terms, emphasizing stimuli and responses rather than emotions and internal states. The novel depicts humans as mechanical beings, creating what Edward Foster describes as a &quot;Pavlovian nightmare&quot;. In particular, Dr Benway uses behavioral conditioning for evil ends, inverting the utopian ideals described by B. F. Skinner in his book Walden Two. Edward Foster sees the Factualists as representing older libertarian values from the Wild west. In contrast, Benway turns drugs and sex into tools of regulation and control, rather than freedom and liberation. Ron Loewinsohn identifies the political parties as representing different methods of international control: Liquefactionists as fascism, Divisionists as colonialism, and Senders as the soft power and cultural influence of the United States. He notes that the Factualists, who infiltrate and undermine the other parties, mirror Burroughs&#x27; understanding of how apomorphine works to relieve opioid addiction. He also notes that this undercover infiltration often leads to the Factualists acting similarly to their opposition, such as AJ and Hassan both staging sadomasochistic parties, but with crucial differences: Hassan&#x27;s cruelty is real, while AJ&#x27;s is simulated. Meanwhile, Freeland, the novel&#x27;s stand-in for Scandinavia, is described as a &quot;police state without police&quot;; its citizens have become so neurotic that they obsessively monitor themselves. 

Interzone is also marked by a violent struggle between Nationalists and Imperialists, reflecting the political situation Burroughs observed in Tangiers. The novel does not align itself with either side. One of the book&#x27;s most political routines mocks the Nationalist Party Leader, describing him as a &quot;gangster in drag&quot; who cares only about his own position, not the residents of Interzone. However, the Capitalists who oppose him are equally unconcerned with Interzone&#x27;s residents, whom they see as merely targets to exploit. This skepticism of both sides reflects Burroughs&#x27; own ambivalence towards Moroccan nationalism. Within Interzone, the racial and national hierarchies of colonialism are superceded by unrestricted capitalism. Hassan, who owns multiple passports and is racially ambiguous, hosts a &quot;rumpus room&quot; in which bodies and sex are commodities and white boys are sexually dominated by boys of other races.

The novel&#x27;s routines emphasize addiction, especially to heroin, which can be read as a metaphor for broader social problems and obsessions. David Ayers interprets heroin as Burroughs&#x27; &quot;paradigm&quot; for understanding systems of control. However, Frank McConnell argues that &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is straightforwardly about heroin addiction in itself, and should not be read as symbolic. Lydenberg argues that Burroughs&#x27; parenthetical asides challenge the reader&#x27;s instinct to &quot;evade&quot; the darkness of the book by treating its disturbing elements as symbols or allegories, and instead show that Burroughs insists on a literal reading. Frederick Whiting emphasizes that the novel&#x27;s drug motif should be seen as a metonym for social and economic issues, not a metaphor.

The novel has been described as &quot;an essentially nihilistic work&quot; and &quot;consistently hostile, contemptuous, forcefully hateful [...] without joy.&quot; Robin Lydenberg suggests that the novel advocates &quot;a violent rejection and undermining of the entire dual system of morality.&quot;

Barry Miles interprets the recurring hanging scenes as critiquing sexual exploitation, racist lynchings, and capital punishment in general. Burroughs himself considered his novel a Swiftian argument against the death penalty.

===The man who taught his asshole to talk===

One of the novel&#x27;s most famous routines describes &quot;the man who taught his asshole to talk&quot;. Armed with the power of speech, the anus takes over the man&#x27;s body and brain. Tony Tanner sees this routine as a paradigm for Burroughs&#x27; general theme of humans decaying into lower forms of life. Wayne Pounds reads it as a parody of behaviorist engineering and the pursuit of efficiency. Robin Lydenberg reads it as challenging the notion that language differentiate humans from animals. Loewinsohn sees it representing zero-sum domination, contrasted against another anus-centered story shortly afterward which represents positive-sum cooperation. Manuel Luis Martínez considers it a political allegory for Burroughs&#x27; libertarian beliefs. The anus claims to want equal rights before taking over the body, and the routine is juxtaposed with Dr. Benway calling democracy a cancer, suggesting that egalitarianism can become authoritarian. Burroughs himself considered the scene a metaphor for ever-expanding bureaucracy.

Jamie Russell interprets the routine as expressing Burroughs&#x27; view of homosexuality. Burroughs believed that men were coerced into a binary of either heterosexuality or effeminacy, as the &quot;sissy&quot; archetype was the only role society recognized for gay men. He considered this feminine mimicry self-destructive, not empowering or subversive, and believed it created a marginalized identity akin to schizophrenia. Russell observes that the anus is originally used for a ventriloquy routine. This mirrors a description in Burroughs&#x27; first novel &quot;Junkie&quot;, in which effeminate gay men are derided as &quot;ventriloquists’ dummies who have moved in and taken over the ventriloquist&quot;.

Barry Miles interprets the anus as Burroughs himself, reflecting his anxieties and frustrations after being romantically rejected by Allen Ginsberg. He interprets the routine as Burroughs empowering himself in the relationship dynamic.

==Literary significance and reception==
Along with &quot;Howl&quot; and &quot;On The Road&quot;, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is considered one of the defining works of the Beat generation.

Mary McCarthy was an early proponent of the novel. She wrote that Burroughs was one of only two authors who had recently interested her (along with Nabokov), defended his crudeness by placing him in the satirical tradition of Jonathan Swift, and praised his &quot;broad and sly&quot; humor by comparing it to vaudeville. John Ciardi, defending the book against charges of obscenity, praised it as &quot;a masterpiece of its own genre&quot; and &quot;a monumentally moral descent into the hell of a narcotic addiction.&quot; Norman Mailer praised Burroughs&#x27; &quot;exquisite poetic sense&quot; and considered &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; a powerful religious work, describing it as &quot;a vision of how mankind would act if man was totally divorced from eternity&quot; and akin to the work of Hieronymus Bosch. J. G. Ballard considered the novel (along with &quot;The Soft Machine&quot; and &quot;The Ticket That Exploded&quot;) to be &quot;the first authentic mythology of the age of Cape Canaveral, Hiroshima and Belsen&quot; and favorably compared Burroughs&#x27; work to &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;. Richard Kostelanetz, while admitting the novel was &quot;wildly uneven&quot; and &quot;among the most horrifying and terrible books ever written&quot;, praised its intensity and imagination, calling it by far the greatest novel of the Beat movement and &quot;perhaps among the greatest literary works of our time&quot;.

In contrast, John Wain called it &quot;a prolonged scream of hatred and disgust&quot; and &quot;the merest trash, not worth a second glance&quot;. Lionel Abel compared the work to a film that spliced together pornography with footage of Nazi concentration camps, writing &quot;Now it is foolish, I think, to justify Naked Lunch as literature. Its descriptions of hallucinatory states under drug addiction are neither beautiful nor exquisite nor brilliant nor informative. I even wonder whether they are true.&quot; David Lodge admitted that Burroughs had &quot;a certain literary talent&quot;, but felt that the novel&#x27;s initial excitement quickly became boring, confused, and unsatisfying. He considered comparisons between Burroughs and Swift &quot;either naive or disingenuous&quot;. In an anonymous review, &quot;Time&quot; magazine panned the book as &quot;the grotesque diary of Burroughs’ years as an addict.&quot; John Willett wrote an anonymous review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; simply titled &quot;Ugh...&quot;, in which he called the book disgusting and monotonous and wrote &quot;If the publishers had deliberately set out to discredit the cause of literary freedom and innovation they could hardly have done it more effectively.&quot; This led to the longest set of responses the &quot;Literary Supplement&quot; had ever received.

Charles Poole, reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, criticized its &quot;glaringly gaudy&quot; approach of &quot;using shocking words by the shovelful and concentrating on perverted degeneracy to a flagrant degree.&quot; A review in &quot;Commentary&quot; described Burroughs&#x27; novel as a more readable version of the work of Alain Robbe-Grillet, but felt that Burroughs&#x27; writing fell short of works by Henry Miller, George Orwell, and the Marquis de Sade, and that the novel ultimately resembled a child&#x27;s tantrum.

Fans of Beat Generation literature, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker named their band Steely Dan after a &quot;revolutionary&quot; steam-powered dildo mentioned in the novel. Lou Reed also identified the book as a major artistic influence.

&quot;Naked Lunch&quot; is considered a key influence on the cyberpunk genre. William Gibson has cited it as one of the novels that most influenced his own writing.

The novel was included in &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

From the 1960s, numerous film-makers considered adapting &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; for the screen. Antony Balch, who worked with Burroughs on a number of short film projects in 1960s, considered making a musical with Mick Jagger in the lead role, but the project fell through when relationships soured between Balch and Jagger. Burroughs himself adapted his book for the never-made film; after Jagger dropped out, Dennis Hopper was considered for the lead role, and at one point game-show producer Chuck Barris was considered a possible financier of the project.

In May 1991, rather than attempting a straight adaptation, Canadian director David Cronenberg took a few elements from the book and combined them with elements of Burroughs&#x27; life, creating a hybrid film about the writing of the book rather than the book itself. Peter Weller starred as William Lee, the pseudonym Burroughs used when he wrote &quot;Junkie&quot;.

===Comic Books===
Italian comics artist , better known under his artistic pseudonym Professor Bad Trip, adapted the novel into a graphic novel titled &quot;Il Pasto Nudo&quot; (1992), published by Shake Edizioni.

==Notes==
: Burroughs retaliated three years later by using a collage with that issue&#x27;s cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine as the cover of his cut-up pamphlet, &quot;Time&quot;.
: A minor character in the novel named Andrew Keif is directly based on Paul Bowles.
: An earlier version of Benway appeared in Burroughs&#x27; 1938 story &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot;, in which he drunkenly performs surgery aboard a sinking ship.

<doc id="265115" wikidata="Q2723899" url="?curid=265115" title="Feluda">
<text>Feluda is a fictional detective, private investigator created by Indian director and writer Satyajit Ray. Feluda resides at 21 Rajani Sen Road, Ballygunge, Calcutta, West Bengal, India. Feluda first made his appearance in a Bengali children&#x27;s magazine called &quot;Sandesh&quot; in 1965, under the editorialship of Ray and Subhas Mukhopadhyay. His first adventure was &quot;Feludar Goendagiri&quot;. Feluda is one of the most impactful Bengali characters of all time.

Feluda is often accompanied by his cousin, who is also his assistant, Tapesh Ranjan Mitter (affectionately called Topshe by Feluda), who serves as the narrator of the stories. From the sixth story, &quot;Sonar Kella&quot; (The Golden Fortress), the duo are joined by a popular thriller writer Jatayu (Lalmohan Ganguli). 

Feluda has had been filmed at times, with the character been played by Soumitra Chatterjee, Sabyasachi Chakrabarty, Ahmed Rubel, Shashi Kapoor, Abir Chatterjee, Parambrata Chatterjee, Tota Roy Chowdhury and Indraneil Sengupta. Satyajit Ray directed two Feluda movies — &quot;Sonar Kella&quot; (1974) and &quot;Joi Baba Felunath&quot; (1978). Sandip Ray made a new Feluda film series (continuation of the original series) on Feluda&#x27;s adventures which started from &quot;Baksho Rahashya&quot; (1996). In this series he made ten TV films and six theatrical films in Bengali on the character. Sandip Ray also made a stand-alone Feluda film &quot;Badshahi Angti&quot; (2014) which was intended to be the first film of a reboot series featuring Abir Chatterjee, but the projects were ultimately shelved and Sandip Ray revived his original film series starring Sabyasachi Chakrabarty.

== Character development ==

=== Inspiration from Sherlock Holmes ===
Satyajit Ray had deep interests in crime fiction and he read all of Sherlock Holmes fictions in his school days. And when Ray himself started writing on crime fictions, unsurprisingly, the character Sherlock Holmes inspired his writings. Feluda&#x27;s character resembles Sherlock Holmes and Tapesh/Topshe&#x27;s character resembles Dr Watson. In the stories of Feluda, he is displayed as a big admirer of Sherlock Holmes which he mentions multiple times. In &quot;Kailash Choudhury&#x27;r Pathar&quot; he praises the way Holmes used to draw large conclusions from observations. In &quot;Londone Feluda&quot;, when Feluda goes to Baker Street, he openly addresses Holmes as the &quot;master&quot; (Bengali: &quot;guru&quot;) of all private detectives.

=== Personality ===
Pradosh Chandra Mitter, popularly known by his nickname Feluda, first appeared in the eponymous Bengali short story &quot;Feludar Goyendagiri&quot; (&quot;Danger in Darjeeling&quot;) in 1965. The story, written by Satyajit Ray, was published in &quot;Sandesh&quot;, a children&#x27;s periodical founded by Ray&#x27;s grandfather, Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury and edited by Ray himself. In the Feluda series that followed, he was portrayed as a man of around 27 (born around 1938) with a tall (almost 6&#x27;0&quot;), athletic figure. Despite being a strongly built man adept in martial arts, Feluda relies mostly upon his superb analytical ability and observation skill (jokingly referred to as the Magajastra or brain-weapon) to solve cases instead of using physical strength or weapons. He is very choosy about taking up cases and prefers cases that require cerebral effort. He possesses a .32 Colt revolver, but the weapon is used very infrequently and mostly for non-violent purposes. However, contemporary (2000s) movies based on Feluda stories feature scenes of violence uncharacteristic in the literature, where Feluda demonstrates his martial art prowess. A master of disguises, Feluda is known to be an adept sleight-of-hand, and he puts these skills to use to solve multiple cases. Feluda often calls a meeting after solving the mystery, where he cajoles the culprit into admitting their crime.

=== Personal life ===
In his personal life, Feluda is a common Bengali youth who has been brought up by his father&#x27;s younger brother (Tapesh/Topshe&#x27;s father) after being orphaned when he was only 9. His father, the late Joykrishna Mitra, used to teach Mathematics and Sanskrit at Dhaka Collegiate School. According to the story &#x27;Royal Bengal Rahasya&#x27;, The ancestral Home of Feluda was in Sona Dighi Village of Bikrampur Region of Dhaka (Now Munshiganj District). His elder Uncle was a manager of a zamindari Estate in Mymensingh and a hunter. After the Partition of 1947, his family moved from Dhaka to Calcutta, living in a rented house in Tara Road. Later, they moved in 21, Rajani Sen Road. Feluda had a job in the bank before his detective career. He finds an avid listener in his cousin Tapesh. He often uses his oratory skill at the climactic scenes to cajole the culprit into confessing his crime. He is an early riser and is frequently shown starting his day with exercises and yoga.

Contrary to his otherwise healthy lifestyle, Feluda enjoys smoking cigarettes and chewing betel leaves after lunch. His favourite brand of cigarettes is Charminar. He is a connoisseur of delicious food, popular music, movies, and books. He has a great appreciation for Sherlock Holmes and, according to the film &quot;Tintorettor Jishu&quot;, Bruce Lee. Similar to Sherlock Holmes, he has a voracious reading habit (reflecting that of Ray&#x27;s own), which add up to his enormous general knowledge. This know-how often comes handy while socialising with people and unravelling mysteries. He always reads up about a place before visiting. He says it comes in handy sometimes. He is shown to be fond of Tintin, and specially his cousin, Topshe, is a fan of Tintin. Some of the Feluda stories and films have many references of The Adventures of Tintin. He is also a huge fan of the books by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Jim Corbett and Kenneth Anderson. His favourite book was &quot;Aranyak&quot; written by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. He is also shown to be fond of non-fiction books like &quot;Aku-Aku, Chariots of the Gods?&quot; and &quot;The Numerology of Dr. Matrix&quot;.

Feluda has love and respect for Lalmohan Ganguly (Jatayu) and his fictional creation Prakhar Rudra is liked by Feluda. He also frequently points out errors and inaccuracies in Jatayu&#x27;s adventure series, and even helps him write a script for a Bollywood film. Feluda is protective and caring about his cousin, yet he always keeps picking mistakes or humor of or from Topshe. Topshe, the narrator, greatly admires his brother and loves to be a part of his adventures. Feluda has never shown interest in any woman, and there are very few female characters in the stories or films (except some minor characters like Topshe&#x27;s mother).

== Other characters ==

=== Topshe ===
Feluda&#x27;s paternal cousin Tapesh Ranjan Mitter, who is fondly referred to as &quot;Topshe&quot;, is based on Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s conception of Dr. John Watson. In the first couple of stories, his surname was &quot;Bose&quot;, but later it changed to &quot;Mitra&quot;. Just like the former army surgeon, Topshe is the quintessential accomplice and faithfully records each of Pradosh Mitter&#x27;s exploits accurately. Topshe is a smart teenager. In the first story of Feluda series (i.e. &quot;Feludar Goyendagiri&quot;), Topshe was thirteen and a half where Feluda&#x27;s age was twenty-seven, just the double of Topshe. Though Feluda often teases his young cousin, he is extremely fond and very protective of him. Feluda lives with Topshe&#x27;s family. Topshe&#x27;s father, Binay Mitter is the younger brother of Feluda&#x27;s father, and therefore his uncle, and they all reside at 21, Rajani Sen Road, Kolkata-700029. Although there really is a &#x27;Rajani Sen Road&#x27; in Kolkata, the house number is missing. Formerly, they all used to live in Tara road, Kolkata. Though not mentioned explicitly, Topshe is good-looking, fair, tall and handsome, as per different illustrations made by Satyajit Ray himself.

Detailed knowledge regarding Topshe&#x27;s high school education is not available, but he used to go to school during the adventure of &quot;Sonar Kella&quot; (the sixth book of Feluda series). In the film adaptation of &quot;Sonar Kella&quot;, Topshe&#x27;s mother shows her concern regarding his career and study as he spends much time solving cases with Feluda. By the time of &quot;Kailashe Kelenkari&quot; (the eighth book of the series) he have had his secondary examination (&#x27;Madhyamik Pariksha&#x27;). Just like Feluda, Topshe also used to read lot of books to enhance his knowledge. Topshe often gets his lessons from Feluda himself. In many cases, Feluda tests his deductive knowledge and he usually passes the test satisfactorily. In the movie &quot; Sonar Kella&quot; Topshe&#x27;s father aptly said that Topshe is a lucky boy who got Feluda as his mentor. Topshe is fond of &#x27;Adventures of Tintin&#x27; comic series. In the book &quot; Kailashe Kelenkari&quot;, he is found reading &#x27;Tintin in Tibet&#x27;.

Topshe always takes an active part in Feluda&#x27;s adventure. Though in most cases, he follows Feluda&#x27;s instructions or indications, there are instances where he himself gets involved into some action/investigation. To mention a few, he and Jatayu (a.k.a. Lalmohan Ganguly) sneaks into a warehouse in &#x27;Patan&#x27; (Nepal) to discover vast collection of smuggled narcotics (book &quot;Jato Kando Kathmandute&quot;); finds out the stabbed body of a missing man in the woods (book &quot;Darjeeling Jomjomat&quot;); replaces the pink pearl with a fake for safe-keeping (book &quot;Golapi Mukta Rahasya&quot;). The last incident impressed Feluda as well. However, all these activities mainly comes in the latter part of the series. He also interrogated the suspects in &quot;Apsara Theaterer Mamla&quot; when Feluda was sick and bedridden. Feluda solved the case just from the report of that interrogation.

In movies and TV films the character of Feluda has been played by Soumitra Chatterjee, Sabyasachi Chakrabarty and recently Abir Chatterjee, while Topshe has been played by Siddartha Chatterjee, Saswata Chatterjee, Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Saheb Bhattacharya over the years. In Sandip Ray&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Badshahi Angti&quot;, actor Sourav Das played the role. 

In Srijit Mukkherjee&#x27;s Webseries, Topshe was played by Kalpan Mitra and Feluda was played by Tota Roy chowdhury. In Arindam Sil&#x27;s Webseries, Feluda was played by Parambrata Chatterjee and Topshe by Rwitobroto Mukherjee.

=== Lalmohan Ganguli or Jatayu ===
Lalmohan Ganguli is a close friend of Pradosh Chandra Mitter, and is described as the author of a series of Bengali crime thrillers written under the pseudonym &#x27;Jatayu&#x27;. His crime stories and novels are usually derided as unbelievable, considering that his main character is always the superhero Prakhar Rudra. Though all his novels seem to have become best-sellers, he often tends to make extremely silly mistakes such as spelling igloos as &#x27;ilgoos&#x27;. In &quot;Baksho Rahasya&quot; or &quot;Incident on the Kalka Mail&quot;, he confuses hippos with walruses — a tendency that Feluda often tries to correct. He sometimes serves as a perfect foil to the group and in Ray&#x27;s own words provides &#x27;dollops of humour&#x27;, although he sometimes does some brave acts not expected of him. To mention a few, he knocked out goons in &quot;Baksho Rahasya&quot;, &quot;Joto Kando Kathmandute&quot;, &quot;Tintorettor Jishu&quot; and &quot;Ebar Kando Kedarnathe&quot;, which impressed Feluda as well. He owns a &#x27;Madrasi green&#x27; Ambassador car. Jatayu makes his first appearance in &quot;Sonar Kella&quot; joining Feluda and Topshe in the train at Kanpur, on their way to Jodhpur. In the first two films on Feluda, which were directed by Ray himself, the character was played by Santosh Dutta, and after the first one, Ray modified the literary character to some extent, making him look and behave quite like Dutta himself. In the next films directed by Ray&#x27;s son, Sandip Ray, this character was played by Mohan Agashe, Rabi Ghosh, Anup Kumar and Bibhu Bhattacharya respectively. Jatayu also has a fantasy of collecting weapons. In various books he carried weapons like &#x27;kukri&#x27; (Nepali knife), and smoke bomb. Jatayu lives at Garpar in Kolkata, and it may be recalled that Satyajit Ray himself passed his childhood at 100, Garpar.

=== Sidhu Jetha ===
Sidhu Jetha&#x27;s formal name is Siddheshwar Bose. He is an aged character who has described himself to be like Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s brother Mycroft, living in Sardar Sankar Road, Lake Market, Kalighat, Kolkata. He is a bibliophile, and has an extensive base of general knowledge, current and historical affairs. He is a close friend of Feluda&#x27;s father, being former neighbours in their ancestral village in Bangladesh. Feluda&#x27;s jyatha (that is, uncle) is said to have a &#x27;photographic memory&#x27;, and is a vast source of information which comes in handy when Feluda is in need of some. His vast knowledge comes from his collection of varied kinds of newspaper clippings which he has accumulated over the years. The role was played by Harindranath Chattopadhyay in &quot;Sonar Kella&quot;, Ajit Bandopadhyay in &quot;Baksho Rahashya&quot;, Dibya Bhattacharya in Golapi Mukto Rahashya, Haradhan Banerjee in &quot;Kailashe Kelenkari&quot; and in &quot;Gorosthaney Sabdhan&quot; and by Paran Bandyopadhyay in &quot;Double Feluda&quot;. Following recent Feluda films made by Sandip Ray, Satyajit Ray&#x27;s son, there have been questions over Sidhu Jyatha&#x27;s continued relevance in the stories considering technologies such as the internet offer a faster, wider and more effective knowledge base than a well-read person.

=== Haripada Datta ===
Haripada Datta is the driver of Lalmohon Ganguli&#x27;s second-hand green Mark II &quot;Ambasador&quot; car. He is a loyal, intelligent and reliable person and is of great help when needed. He played a crucial role in &quot;Gorosthaney Sabhdhan&quot; where he saved the lives of Feluda, Jatayu, and Topshe. He also has a minor role in &quot;Boshpukery Khunkharapi&quot;, where he takes part in a surveillance mission with the rest of Feluda&#x27;s gang in disguise playing 29 cardgame.

=== Maganlal Meghraj ===

Meghraj is a villainous character who appears in three Feluda stories, including &quot;Joi Baba Felunath&quot;, &quot;Joto Kando Kathmandute&quot;, and &quot;Golapi Mukta Rahasya&quot;. He has been compared to Professor Moriarty of the Sherlock Holmes series. Utpal Dutta immortalised this character in one Feluda movie &quot;Joi Baba Felunath&quot;, which Satyajit Ray directed. After him Mohan Agashe played this character twice in telefilms.

Maganlal lives in Benaras. He has a house in Joka, Kolkata also. His son&#x27;s name is Surajlal Meghraj. He is officially a money-lender but is involved in smuggling artifacts, narcotics (through Indo-Nepal border) and jewellery. His Kolkata house had been raided once but he escaped any charges until Feluda caught him red-handed in smuggling an invaluable Ganesh Murti (an idol of the elephant god) during the case of &quot;Joi Baba Felunath&quot;. However, he was not behind bars for a long time. In the nineteenth book, &quot;Jato Kando Kathmandute&quot;, Feluda said that he was not at all surprised seeing Meghraj out of jail as that was nothing for such an influential person. Once again he was arrested in charge of murder and smuggling, yet he averted any long term punishment and we saw him once again in the thirty-first story, &quot;Golapi Mukta Rahasya.&quot;

Maganlal is a good judge of human character. He lured &quot;Bikash Singh&quot;, secretary of &quot;Umanath Ghoshal&quot;, to steal the invaluable &#x27;Ganesh Murti&#x27; from the Ghoshal-house. He also has a special interest in humiliating &quot;Jatayu&quot;. In &quot;Joi Baba Felunath&quot; he made Jatayu the subject of a knife-throwing play. In &quot;Jato Kando Kathmandute&quot;, he purposefully slips an LSD-laced sugar cube in Jatayu&#x27;s tea. In his third appearance, he made Jatayu to sing a Tagore song (which Jatayu said his first time experience of singing a song). Surprisingly, he shows a queer fondness to Jatayu and usually calls him &#x27;Uncle&#x27;.

During these three stories, we see many accomplices of Maganlal. Some of them are Machhli-Baba, Bikash Sinha, Arjun the knife thrower, Anantalaal Bantra, Dr. Dibakar and Manohar. Maganlaal has his own &quot;Bajra&quot; by which he travels in Ganga near Benaras. The door of his house in Benaras is painted with figures of two swordsmen. During the making of the movie, &quot;&quot;Joi Baba Felunath&quot;&quot;, this swordsmen were painted by Satyajit Ray himself.

=== Pulak Ghoshal ===
Ghoshal is a Mumbai-based popular Hindi film director hailing from Kolkata. His original home in Kolkata is in the neighbourhood of Lalmohonbabu&#x27;s in northern Kolkata&#x27;s Garpar. He has directed two films based on Lalmohonbabu&#x27;s stories. During the shooting of both these films, dangerous events took place, resulting in arrest of a producer in one film (&quot;Bombaiyer Bombete&quot;) and arrest of an actor in another film (&quot;Darjeeling Jamjomat&quot;).

=== Minor characters ===
* Srinath is the domestic help of Feluda and Topshe. He is often seen serving tea and snacks for Feluda and his clients.
* Jagannath is the household cook at Feluda&#x27;s place. 
* Bharadwaj is the household cook at Lalmohan Babu&#x27;s place.
* Baikuntha Nath Mallik was a poet, tourist and Bangla teacher at Ethenium Institution where Lalmohan Babu used to study. When he was in the seventh grade, he won prize for reciting Baikuntha&#x27;s poem on sea. Lalmohan Babu often describes him as a great poet who did not get the adulation he deserved. There is no presence of him in the story but in some stories we can see Jatayu reciting his poems.

=== Films ===

Satyajit Ray directed &quot;Sonar Kella&quot; (1974) and &quot;Joi Baba Felunath&quot; (1979) into movies in Bengali, starring actor Soumitra Chatterjee as Feluda, Santosh Dutta as Jatayu and Siddartha Chatterjee as Topshe. This two films created a cult following in Bengali cinema later years.

Sandip Ray directed five Feluda theatrical feature-length films, starring actor Sabyasachi Chakrabarty as Feluda, Parambrata Chatterjee as Topshe in the first three films (Later he was replaced by Saheb Bhattacharyya) and Bibhu Bhattacharya as Jatayu. 
But the first theatrically released Feluda film directed by Sandip Ray was &quot;Baksho Rahashya&quot; (1996) which was the first film of the Feluda TV film series and
was made for television release only.
It was released in theaters in December 2001. In this TV film Sabyasachi Chakrabarty was Feluda, Saswata Chatterjee was Topshe and Rabi Ghosh was Jatayu.

*&quot;Bombaiyer Bombete&quot; was released in December 2003. 
*&quot;Kailashey Kelenkari&quot; was released in December 2007.
*&quot;Tintorettor Jishu&quot; was released in December 2008.
*&quot;Gorosthaney Sabdhan&quot; was released in December 2010. 
* &quot;Royal Bengal Rahashya&quot;, released in December 2011

Then Sandip Ray directed &quot;Badshahi Angti&quot; which was released in November 2014, in which Abir Chatterjee is playing Feluda for first time. This was going to be a reboot to previous the Feluda film series after &quot;Royal Bengal Rahashya.&quot; However, in 2016 Sandip Ray cancelled the reboot series because Abir Chatterjee started a new version of film series based on the Byomkesh Bakshi franchise under Shree Venkatesh Films and Surinder Films. The other reason was the new Feluda movie Sandip Ray intended to make under a Mumbai-based production house Eros International, but Abir has a strict contract with Shree Venkatesh Films and Surinder Films. For the cancellation of the reboot series &quot;Badshahi Angti&quot; is now considered as a stand-alone reboot film.

On 23 December 2022, Hatyapuri was released under the banner of Shadow Films. This was the reboot to the previous Feluda film series. The film was directed by Sandip Ray and starred Indraneil Sengupta as Feluda alongside Ayush Das and Abhijit Guha as Topshe and Jatayu respectively. Within a year and a half, Nayan Rahasya was released in May 2024, produced by Surinder Films. Indraneil Sengupta, Ayush Das and Abhijit Guha reprise 
the role of Feluda, Topshe and Jatayu respectively.
*As a tribute to the 50-year anniversary of Feluda,a special film &quot;Double Feluda&quot; was released in December 2016. It was a continuation of the original Feluda movie series where Sabyasachi Chakrabarty and Saheb Bhattacharya reprised their roles as Feluda and Topshe respectively. The movie consisted of two stories, Samaddar-er-Chabi and Golokdham Rahashya, shown on either half of the movie.

<doc id="265116" wikidata="Q2188052" url="?curid=265116" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 940">
<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 940, adopted on 31 July 1994, after recalling resolutions 841 (1993), 861 (1993), 862 (1993), 867 (1993), 873 (1993), 875 (1993), 905 (1994), 917 (1994) and 933 (1994), the Council permitted a United States-led force to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and authorities of the Government of Haiti, and extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) for an additional six months.

==Resolution==
The council began with condemnations of the military regime in Haiti because it had refused to co-operate with the United Nations. Some concern was also expressed at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, violations of civil liberties and expulsion of staff from the International Civilian Mission.

The resolution claimed an extraordinary situation in Haiti, which required an exceptional response. The Council then authorised, under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, for Member States to form a multinational force under US command to overthrow current leaders from Haiti, and for previous ones to return to an environment in which a United States agreement could be implemented. An advance team of no more than 60 personnel was established in order to co-ordinate and observe the American operations, requesting the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to report back on developments relating to the advance team within 30 days.

Once the multinational force had completed its mission, UNMIH would take over its functions when a suitable environment had been secured. After extending UNMIH&#x27;s mandate for six months, it was decided to increase the size of the mission to 6,000 troops with the aim of completing it by February 1996. The safety of United Nations personnel and those from diplomatic missions and international humanitarian organisations would be guaranteed. Finally, international sanctions imposed on Haiti would be lifted once Aristide had been returned to power.

Resolution 940 was controversially adopted by 12 votes to none, with two abstentions from Brazil and China, while Rwanda was not present when voting took place, most likely due to the ongoing Rwandan Genocide. Accusations surfaced of US pressure.

==Reaction==
The vote was the first time the United Nations sanctioned the use of an invading force to &quot;restore democracy.&quot; It was also the first time the US has sought and gained UN approval for a military intervention in the Americas.

Many Latin American countries were opposed to the resolution. Mexico&#x27;s UN ambassador, Víctor Flores Olea, spoke out against the resolution, saying that &quot;it sets an extremely dangerous precedent in the field of international relations&quot; because the crisis &quot;does not constitute a threat to peace and international security.&quot; Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said that the resolution furthers &quot;the repeated attempts by the Security Council to amplify its powers beyond those which were granted it by the Charter.&quot;

Brazilian President Itamar Franco strongly opposed the UN decision, saying &quot;The Security Council&#x27;s special powers should not be invoked in an indiscriminate manner in the name of a &#x27;search for more rapid means&#x27; to respond to attacks on democracy, because it violates the basic principles of peaceful co-existence between nations and normal UN legal procedures.&quot; After a visit to Brazil from U.S. Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff the week before the vote, Brazil&#x27;s decision to abstain instead of oppose the resolution can clearly be seen to be the result of enormous U.S. pressure.

Pointing out that the situation in Haiti posed no threat to world peace and security, Uruguay&#x27;s UN representative Ramiro Piriz Ballon said his country &quot;will not support any military intervention, unilateral or multilateral.&quot;

Argentina initially offered to send four marine and infantry companies to join the U.S.-led invasion forces. However, after popular discontent over the decision, President Carlos Menem was forced to back down on the offer.

On 17 January 1995, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali issued a 17-page report on the result of the intervention: the report noted the ongoing repression in Haiti, the complete lack of justice for victims of the September 1991 coup d&#x27;état, the deteriorating economic situation, and the growing impatience of the Haitian people.

<doc id="265118" wikidata="Q2372824" url="?curid=265118" title="Elephantidae">
<text>Elephantidae is a family of large, herbivorous proboscidean mammals which includes the living elephants (belonging to the genera &quot;Elephas&quot; and &quot;Loxodonta&quot;), as well as a number of extinct genera like &quot;Mammuthus&quot; (mammoths) and &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;. They are large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct.

The family was first described by John Edward Gray in 1821, and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within the order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to include or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera.

== Description ==

Elephantids are distinguished from more primitive proboscideans like gomphotheres by their teeth, which have parallel lophs, formed from the merger of the cusps found in the teeth of more primitive proboscideans, which are bound by cementum. In later elephantids, these lophs became narrow lamellae/plates, which are pockets of enamel filled with dentine, which are arranged successively like a concertina. The number of lophs/lamellae per tooth, as well as the tooth crown height (hypsodonty) is greater in later species. Elephantids chew using a proal jaw movement involving a forward stroke of the lower jaws, different from the oblique movement using side to side motion of the jaws in more primitive proboscideans. The most primitive elephantid &quot;Stegotetrabelodon&quot; had a long lower jaw with lower tusks and retained permanent premolars similar to many gomphotheres, while modern elephantids lack permanent premolars, with the lower jaw being shortened (brevirostrine) and lower tusks being absent.

Elephantids are typically sexually dimorphic, with substantially larger males, with an accelerated growth rate over a longer period of time than females. Elephantidae contains some of the largest known proboscideans, with fully-grown males of some species of mammoths and &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; having average body masses of and respectively, making them among the largest terrestrial mammals ever. One species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus&quot;, has been suggested to have been possibly the largest land mammal of all time, though this remains speculative due to the fragmentary nature of known remains. In comparison to more primitive elephantimorphs like gomphotheres, the bodies of elephantids tend to be proportionally shorter from front to back, as well having more elongate limbs with more slender limb bones.
== Ecology ==

Living female and juvenile elephants live in matriarchal (female-led) herds of related individuals, with males leaving these groups to live solitarily upon reaching adolescence around 14–15 years of age. Evidence has been found that extinct elephantids, including the most primitive elephantid, &quot;Stegotetrabelodon&quot;, also lived in herds based on footprint tracks.

==Classification==


Some authors have suggested to classify the family into two subfamilies, Stegotetrabelodontinae, which is monotypic, only containing &quot;Stegotetrabelodon&quot;, and Elephantinae, containing all other elephantids. Recent genetic research has indicated that &quot;Elephas&quot; and &quot;Mammuthus&quot; are more closely related to each other than to &quot;Loxodonta&quot;, with &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; closely related to &quot;Loxodonta&quot;. &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; also appears to have received extensive hybridisation with the African forest elephant, and to a lesser extent with mammoths.

==Evolutionary history==
Around 10 million years ago, the earliest members of the family Elephantidae emerged in Africa, having originated from gomphotheres. The earliest members of the modern genera of Elephantidae appeared during the latest Miocene–early Pliocene around 5 million years ago. The elephantid genera &quot;Elephas&quot; (which includes the living Asian elephant) and &quot;Mammuthus&quot; (mammoths) migrated out of Africa during the late Pliocene, around 3.6 to 3.2 million years ago. Mammoths then migrated into North America around 1.5 million years ago. At the end of the Early Pleistocene, around 800,000 years ago the elephantid genus &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; dispersed outside of Africa, becoming widely distributed in Eurasia. &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; became extinct as part of the Late Pleistocene extinctions, with mammoths only surviving in relict populations on islands around the Bering Strait into the Holocene, with their latest survival being on Wrangel Island, where they persisted until around 4,000 years ago.

<doc id="265128" wikidata="Q1754768" url="?curid=265128" title="Cost-effectiveness analysis">
<text>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes (effects) of different courses of action. Cost-effectiveness analysis is distinct from cost–benefit analysis, which assigns a monetary value to the measure of effect. Cost-effectiveness analysis is often used in the field of health services, where it may be inappropriate to monetize health effect. Typically the CEA is expressed in terms of a ratio where the denominator is a gain in health from a measure (years of life, premature births averted, sight-years gained) and the numerator is the cost associated with the health gain. The most commonly used outcome measure is quality-adjusted life years (QALY).

Cost–utility analysis is similar to cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-effectiveness analyses are often visualized on a plane consisting of four quadrants, the cost represented on one axis and the effectiveness on the other axis. Cost-effectiveness analysis focuses on maximising the average level of an outcome, distributional cost-effectiveness analysis extends the core methods of CEA to incorporate concerns for the distribution of outcomes as well as their average level and make trade-offs between equity and efficiency, these more sophisticated methods are of particular interest when analysing interventions to tackle health inequality.

==Applications==
The concept of cost-effectiveness is applied to the planning and management of many types of organized activity. It is widely used in many aspects of life. 

===In military acquisitions===
In the acquisition of military tanks, for example, competing designs are compared not only for purchase price, but also for such factors as their operating radius, top speed, rate of fire, armor protection, and caliber and armor penetration of their guns. If a tank&#x27;s performance in these areas is equal or even slightly inferior to its competitor, but substantially less expensive and easier to produce, military planners may select it as more cost-effective than the competitor.

Conversely, if the difference in price is near zero, but the more costly competitor would convey an enormous battlefield advantage through special ammunition, radar fire control and laser range finding, enabling it to destroy enemy tanks accurately at extreme ranges, military planners may choose it instead – based on the same cost-effectiveness principle.

===In pharmacoeconomics===
In the context of pharmacoeconomics, the cost-effectiveness of a therapeutic or preventive intervention is the ratio of the cost of the intervention to a relevant measure of its effect. Cost refers to the resource expended for the intervention, usually measured in monetary terms such as dollars or pounds. The measure of effects depends on the intervention being considered. Examples include the number of people cured of a disease, the mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure and the number of symptom-free days experienced by a patient. The selection of the appropriate effect measure should be based on clinical judgment in the context of the intervention being considered.

A special case of CEA is cost–utility analysis, where the effects are measured in terms of years of full health lived, using a measure such as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) or disability-adjusted life years. Cost-effectiveness is typically expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the ratio of change in costs to the change in effects. A complete compilation of cost-utility analyses in the peer-reviewed medical and public health literature is available from the Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry website.

A 1995 study of the cost-effectiveness of reviewed over 500 life-saving interventions found that the median cost-effectiveness was $42,000 per life-year saved. A 2006 systematic review found that industry-funded studies often concluded with cost-effective ratios below $20,000 per QALY and low quality studies and those conducted outside the US and EU were less likely to be below this threshold. While the two conclusions of this article may indicate that industry-funded ICER measures are lower methodological quality than those published by non-industry sources, there is also a possibility that, due to the nature of retrospective or other non-public work, publication bias may exist rather than methodology biases. There may be incentive for an organization not to develop or publish an analysis that does not demonstrate the value of their product. Additionally, peer reviewed journal articles should have a strong and defendable methodology, as that is the expectation of the peer-review process.

===In energy efficiency investments===
CEA has been applied to energy efficiency investments in buildings to calculate the value of energy saved in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Such savings are sometimes called &quot;negawatts&quot;. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.

<text>ICER is a wavelet-based image compression file format used by the NASA Mars rovers. ICER has both lossy and lossless compression modes.

The Mars Exploration Rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; both used ICER. Onboard image compression is used extensively to make best use of the downlink resources. The &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover supports the use of ICER for its navigation cameras (but all other cameras use other file formats).

Most of the MER images are compressed with the ICER image compression software. The remaining MER images that are compressed make use of modified Low Complexity Lossless Compression (LOCO) software, a lossless submode of ICER.

ICER is a wavelet-based image compressor that allows for a graceful trade-off between the amount of compression (expressed in terms of compressed data volume in bits/pixel) and the resulting degradation in image quality (distortion). ICER has some similarities to JPEG2000, with respect to select wavelet operations.

The development of ICER was driven by the desire to achieve high compression performance while meeting the specialized needs of deep space applications.

== Practical considerations ==
To control the image quality and amount of compression in ICER, the user specifies a byte quota (the nominal number of bytes to be used to store the compressed image) and a quality level parameter (which is essentially a quality goal). ICER attempts to produce a compressed image that meets the quality level using as few compressed bytes as possible. It stops producing compressed bytes once the quality level or byte quota is met, whichever comes first.

This arrangement provides added flexibility compared to compressors (like the JPEG compressor used on Mars Pathfinder) that provide only a single parameter to control image quality. Using ICER, when the primary concern is the bandwidth available to transmit the compressed image, one can set the quality goal to lossless and the given byte quota will determine the amount of compression obtained.

At the other extreme—when the only important consideration is a minimum acceptable image quality—it is possible to specify sufficiently large byte quota and the amount of compression will be determined by the quality level specified.

To achieve error containment, ICER produces the compressed bitstream in separate pieces or segments that can be decoded independently. These segments represent rectangular regions of the original image, but are defined in the transform domain. If, instead, the image were partitioned directly and the wavelet transform separately applied to each segment, under lossy compression the boundaries between segments would tend to be noticeable in the reconstructed image even when no compressed data is lost.

Since ICER provides a facility for automated flexibility in choosing the number of segments, compression effectiveness can be traded against packet loss protection, thereby accommodating different channel error rates.

More segments are not always bad for compression effectiveness: many images are most effectively compressed using 4 to 6 segments (for megapixel images) because disparate regions of the image end up in different segments.

== Design commonalities with the JPEG2000 compressor ==
JPEG 2000 has some design commonalities with the ICER image compression format that is used to send images back from the Mars rovers.

ICER (like JPEG 2000) is wavelet-based and provides
* progressive compression.
* lossless compression (using the LOCO compressor).
* lossy compression.
* image context error correction to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel.

ICER overall provides lossy compression performance
competitive with the JPEG2000 image compression standard.

ICER-JPEG 2000 Common Features
* Both offer a variable number of image tiles to increase compression effectiveness over the deep space channel. Image tiles reduce demands on memory and processing time.
* Both offer a &#x27;byte&#x27; quota.
* Both offer a &#x27;quality&#x27; quota.

== ICER-JPEG 2000 differences ==
JPEG2000 and ICER have many important internal differences
* JPEG 2000 uses floating point math, where ICER uses only integer math. Thus ICER will have good performance on integer only CPUs like the T414 Transputer, whereas JPEG 2000 will not perform as well as it is forced into floating point emulation.
* ICER reverts to a separate internal LOCO (Low Complexity Lossless Compression) compressor for lossless image compression.
* JPEG 2000 implements a low complexity symmetrical wavelet lossless compressor, but ICER uses an integer only non-wavelet lossless compressor.
* ICER and JPEG 2000 encode color spaces differently.
* ICER in its current form does compress monochrome images better than colour images due to its origins as an internal NASA Deep Space Network file format.
* ICER is subject to less than 1% overshoot when byte and quality quotas are in effect. On the other hand, JPEG2000 codecs are typically designed never to overshoot their byte quotas.

== When should one use ICER or ICER-3D ==
ICER was created for low end 32 bit CPUs (essentially embedded computers) on spacecraft. It was finally used for the Mars Exploration Rovers. It has never been used for any real time application, only near real time.

JPEG2000 has been used by many image processing applications in near real time and real-time (Digital Cinema, Broadcast). Main advantages of the codec is that it is License free (JPEG2000 PART1). The JPEG committee has stated: “It has always been a strong goal of the JPEG committee that its standards should be implementable in their baseline form without payment of royalty and license fees.[...] Agreements have been reached with over 20 large organizations holding many patents in this area to allow use of their intellectual property in connection with the standard without payment of license fees or royalties”.
Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s Remote Graphics Software uses a video codec called HP3 (codec) which claims to derive from Mars rover compression - this could be a real-time implementation of ICER.
ICER offers a new mode called Spectral+ICER that makes possible lower rate distortion levels (aka grey level errors) with ICER images. This mode is only so far being used with the Mars Pathfinders, but may see wider implementation in the ICER standard .

== ICER-3D ==
ICER-3D is a compressor for hyperspectral images. Error-containment segments in ICER-3D are defined spatially (in the wavelet transform domain), similarly to JPEG 2000. The wavelet-transformed data are partitioned in much the same way as in ICER, except that in ICER-3D the segments extend through all spectral bands. Error-containment segments in ICER and ICER-3D are defined using an unmodified form of the ICER rectangle partitioning algorithm.

In ICER-3D, contexts are defined based on two neighboring coefficients in the spectral dimension and no neighboring coefficients in the same spatial plane. This contrasts with the context modeling scheme used by ICER, which makes use of previously encoded information from spatially neighboring coefficients.

ICER-3D exploits 3D data dependencies in part by using a 3-D wavelet decomposition. The particular
decomposition used by ICER-3D includes additional spatial decomposition steps compared to a 3-D Mallat
decomposition. This modified decomposition provides benefits in the form of quantitatively improved
rate-distortion performance and in the elimination of spectral ringing artifacts.

ICER-3D takes advantage of the correlation properties of wavelet-transformed hyperspectral data by
using a context modeling procedure that emphasizes spectral (rather than spatial) dependencies in the
wavelet-transformed data. This provides a significant gain over the alternative spatial context modeler considered.

ICER-3D also inherits most of the important features of ICER, including progressive compression, the ability to perform lossless and lossy compression, and an effective error-containment scheme to limit the effects of data loss on the deep-space channel.

<text>Shashi Kapoor ( ; born Balbir Raj Kapoor; 18 March 1938 – 4 December 2017) was an Indian actor and film producer who is best known for his works in Hindi films. A recipient of several accolades, including four National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards, he also featured in a number of English-language international films, particularly films produced by Merchant Ivory. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 2011, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, in 2014, for his contribution to Indian cinema.

Born into the Kapoor family, he was the third and the youngest son of Prithviraj Kapoor. He began his career as a child actor in 1948 with his brother Raj Kapoor&#x27;s maiden directorial &quot;Aag&quot;, and had his first role as an adult in 1961 with Yash Chopra&#x27;s political drama &quot;Dharmputra&quot;. He established himself in 1965 with two blockbusters - &quot;Waqt&quot; and &quot;Jab Jab Phool Khile&quot;. This was followed by a period of lukewarm success, with &quot;Kanyadaan&quot;, &quot;Sharmeelee&quot; and &quot;Aa Gale Lag Jaa&quot; being the major exceptions. He made a notable comeback in 1974 with &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot;. With its success, Kapoor became the top five to six saleable stars of the time and starred in top–grossing Hindi films since the early-1970s to 1980s, such as &quot;Roti Kapada Aur Makaan&quot;, &quot;Deewaar&quot;, &quot;Chori Mera Kaam&quot;, &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot;, &quot;Fakira&quot;, &quot;Trishul&quot;, &quot;Suhaag&quot;, &quot;Kranti&quot; and &quot;Namak Halaal&quot;. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of a reckless chieftain in &quot;Junoon&quot;, a businessman in &quot;Kalyug&quot;, a strict father in &quot;Vijeta&quot; and an upright journalist in &quot;New Delhi Times&quot; for which he won National Film Award for Best Actor. The last film to feature him was the much delayed &quot;Ghar Bazar&quot; which released in 1998.

==Early life==

Shashi Kapoor was born as Balbir Raj Kapoor to Prithviraj Kapoor and his wife in Calcutta, British India, on 18 March 1938. He was the youngest brother of Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor. Actor Trilok Kapoor was his paternal uncle.

Kapoor acted in plays, directed and produced by his father Prithviraj Kapoor, while travelling with Prithvi Theatres. He started acting in films as a child in the late 1940s under the name of Shashiraj, as there was already another actor by the same name who used to act in mythological films as a child artiste. His best-known performances as a child actor were in &quot;Aag&quot; (1948) and &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951), where he played the younger version of the characters played by his older brother Raj Kapoor, and in &quot;Sangram&quot; (1950), where he played the younger version of Ashok Kumar and &quot;Dana Paani&quot; (1953) where he acted with Bharat Bhushan. He worked in four Hindi films as a child artiste from 1948 to 1954.

==Career==

===Rise to stardom (1961–1965)===

After appearing as a child artist in some highly successful films like &quot;Sangram&quot; (1950), &quot;Samadhi&quot; (1950) and &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951), Shashi Kapoor made his debut as a leading man in 1961 with Yash Chopra&#x27;s partition drama &quot;Dharmputra&quot;. This was followed by another release the same year in &quot;Char Diwari&quot;. Both &quot;Dharmputra&quot; and &quot;Char Diwari&quot; didn&#x27;t do well at ticket counters. From 1962 to 1964, Kapoor saw two minor successes with - Bimal Roy&#x27;s &quot;Prem Patra&quot; (1962) and Kanak Mishra&#x27;s &quot;Yeh Dil Kisko Doon&quot; (1963). He also made his English film debut in 1963 with James Ivory&#x27;s acclaimed family drama &quot;The Householder&quot;.

The year 1965 changed his fortune as he starred in two highest grossing films of that year with Yash Chopra&#x27;s masala film &quot;Waqt&quot; and Suraj Prakash&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Jab Jab Phool Khile&quot;. &quot;Waqt&quot; went on to become a massive blockbuster at the box office, receiving praise for performances of the cast, Chopra&#x27;s direction and cinematography. Today, it is widely regarded as an evergreen classic. The huge box office success of &quot;Waqt&quot; was followed by another blockbuster in &quot;Jab Jab Phool Khile&quot; which had Kapoor paired opposite Nanda. It too opened to highly positive response from critics, especially for its soundtrack composed by Kalyanji–Anandji, which was the fourth best-selling Hindi film album of the 1960s with a number of melodious songs, like &quot;Ye Samaa Samaa Hai Pyar Ka&quot;, &quot;Affoo Khudaya&quot;, &quot;Ek Tha Gul Aur Ek Thi Bulbul&quot;, &quot;Na Na Karte Pyar Tumhin Se&quot;, &quot;Pardesiyon Se Na Ankhiyan Milana&quot;. &quot;Jab Jab Phool Khile&quot; made Kapoor a star and won him that year&#x27;s BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) for his moving performance of an innocent boatman in the film.

===Sporadic success, resurgence and critical acclaim (1966–1986)===

Inspite of establishing himself, Kapoor&#x27;s career fluctuated in the late-1960s as very few of his films emerged successful during this period.

In 1966, he starred alongside Kishore Kumar, Mehmood, Kalpana Mohan, Rajasree and Mumtaz in C. V. Sridhar&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Pyar Kiye Jaa&quot;. &quot;Pyar Kiye Jaa&quot; proved to be a hit, but his other release &quot;Neend Hamari Khwab Tumhare&quot; again opposite Nanda did only average business at the box office. After seeing two more moderate successes in 1967 with &quot;Dil Ne Pukara&quot; and &quot;Aamne Samne&quot;, the following year, he delivered a superhit in &quot;Kanyadaan&quot; opposite Asha Parekh, followed by a hit film &quot;Haseena Maan Jayegi&quot; co-starring Babita. The soundtrack of &quot;Kanyadaan&quot; composed by Shankar-Jaikishan was also very successful with two chartbuster Mohammed Rafi solos - &quot;Likhe Jo Khat Tujhe&quot; and &quot;Meri Zindagi Mein Aate&quot; topping the musical charts. In the beginning of the 1970s, Kapoor delivered two notable commercial successes, Samir Ganguly&#x27;s romantic thriller &quot;Sharmeelee&quot; (1971) opposite Rakhee Gulzar and Manmohan Desai&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Aa Gale Lag Jaa&quot; (1973) co-starring Sharmila Tagore.

The year 1974 changed the trajectory of Kapoor&#x27;s career and marked his comeback. It started with Ashok Roy&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; which also had Mumtaz, Asrani and Danny Denzongpa in the lead. &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; proved to be a blockbuster in India as well as overseas, putting a line of producers outside Kapoor&#x27;s house and making him top five to six saleable stars of the time. The huge box office success of &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; was followed by Manoj Kumar&#x27;s social drama &quot;Roti Kapada Aur Makaan&quot;. &quot;Roti Kapada Aur Makaan&quot; went on to become an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; and is regarded as one of the most influential movies of its time. &quot;Roti Kapada Aur Makaan&quot; and &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; took 1st and 2nd spot, respectively at the box office in 1974. Apart from commercial success, both the films had highly successful music and were two of the best-selling Bollywood albums of the decade. The song &quot;Le Jayenge, Le Jayenge Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&quot; from &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; was so popular that it went on to inspire the title of Shah Rukh Khan starrer &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;. 1975 proved to be another iconic year for Kapoor as he formed a hit pair with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and together both of them gave many successful and iconic films to Hindi cinema. His first release &quot;Anari&quot; underperformed commercially, but his second release,
&quot;Deewaar&quot; directed by Yash Chopra, written by Salim-Javed and co-starring Bachchan, Parveen Babi, Neetu Singh, proved to be a widespread critical and commercial success, eventually emerging a major blockbuster. Today, it is considered one of the best films ever made in the history of Indian cinema and got featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. One of Kapoor&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Mere paas maa hai&quot; (&quot;I have mother&quot;), is widely known in India and has become part of Indian popular culture. His impactful portrayal of a police officer torn between love for his brother and duty met with acclaim and won him Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His next release was Raj Khosla&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Prem Kahani&quot; which also had Rajesh Khanna and Mumtaz in the lead. The film received good response from reviewers as well as the audience and proved to be a hit at the box office. Kapoor delivered another huge hit that year with Brij Sadanah&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Chori Mera Kaam&quot; opposite Zeenat Aman, followed by a semi-hit film, &quot;Salaakhen&quot; alongside Sulakshana Pandit to go with the huge grossers. He began 1976 with Yash Chopra&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot;. It had a massive star cast comprising Waheeda Rehman, Bachchan, Rishi Kapoor, Rakhee and Neetu Singh. Despite its heavy theme, &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot; went on to become a superhit. It also had a chartbuster soundtrack composed by Khayyam with lyrics written by Sahir Ludhianvi. Rakesh Budhu of &quot;Planet Bollywood&quot; gave 9.5 stars out of 10 to the album stating, &quot; will remain an ode to brilliant melody&quot;. For his performance in the film, Kapoor received a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category. After the huge success of &quot;Kabhi Kabhie&quot;, he reunited with the team of &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; and delivered another blockbuster in &quot;Fakira&quot;, which was also remade in Telugu as &quot;Dongalaku Donga&quot; (1977). This was followed by two more successes in Shibu Mitra&#x27;s &quot;Shankar Dada&quot; and Mohan Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Aap Beati&quot;.

The following year, Kapoor reunited with Bachchan for Desh Mukherjee&#x27;s highly anticipated actioner &quot;Immaan Dharam&quot;, which took a bumper opening, but collections dropped afterwards due to poor reception and it ended up as a flop venture by the conclusion of its run. His most of the other releases that year, such as &quot;Hira Aur Patthar&quot;, &quot;Farishta Ya Qatil&quot;, &quot;Chakkar Pe Chakkar&quot; met the same fate, with the exceptions being Prayag Raj&#x27;s &quot;Chor Sipahee&quot; and Raj Tilak&#x27;s &quot;Mukti&quot;. This changed in 1978 as he delivered a string of successes with &quot;Phaansi&quot;, &quot;Satyam Shivam Sundaram&quot;, &quot;Trishul&quot;, &quot;Trishna&quot;, &quot;Amar Shakti&quot; and &quot;Aahuti&quot;. Kapoor also set up his own production house, Film-Valas, the same year. In 1979, he reunited with Bachchan for two big-budget actioners, The first one was Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; and the second was Manmohan Desai&#x27;s &quot;Suhaag&quot;. &quot;Kaala Patthar&quot; written by Salim-Javed went on to become a hit. One song from the film, &quot;Ek Raasta Hai Zindagi&quot; sung by Kishore Kumar and filmed on Kapoor remains highly popular till date. &quot;Suhaag&quot;, on the other hand, was a blockbuster as well as the highest grossing film of 1979. That same year, he produced and starred in Shyam Benegal&#x27;s art-house film &quot;Junoon&quot; which also had Nafisa Ali, Shabana Azmi, Jennifer Kendal and Naseeruddin Shah in the lead. &quot;Junoon&quot; met with acclaim, winning Kapoor National Award for Best Feature Film (Hindi) as well as Filmfare Award for Best Film.
In 1980, Kapoor delivered a hit with &quot;Swayamvar&quot;, but his other releases, such as &quot;Do Aur Do Paanch&quot; and &quot;Neeyat&quot; failed to leave a mark while Ramesh Sippy&#x27;s mega-budget action crime film &quot;Shaan&quot; ended up as an average grosser owing to huge costs. The following year, he co-starred alongside Dilip Kumar, Manoj Kumar, Hema Malini, Shatrughan Sinha and Parveen Babi in the epic historical drama &quot;Kranti&quot;. It went on to become the biggest patriotic hit of all time, topping the box office chart in 1981 and emerging an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot;. That same year, he saw a moderate success in &quot;Maan Gaye Ustaad&quot; and received acclaim for his performances in Yash Chopra&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Silsila&quot; and Shyam Benegal&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Kalyug&quot; (which he also produced). Kapoor had five releases in 1982. He found no success in &quot;Vakil Babu&quot; and &quot;Sawaal&quot;. However, Bapu&#x27;s crime drama film &quot;Bezubaan&quot; opposite Reena Roy was a major commercial success and Prakash Mehra&#x27;s masala film &quot;Namak Halaal&quot; co-starring Bachchan, Smita Patil and Parveen Babi went on to become a blockbuster. His other notable release that year was Govind Nihalani&#x27;s coming-of-age film &quot;Vijeta&quot;, which had his son Kunal Kapoor in his acting debut. The film didn&#x27;t performed well commercially, but received immense critical acclaim and won three awards at the 31st Filmfare Awards.

Post-1982, Kapoor&#x27;s star power began to wane as he shifted his focus majorly towards parallel cinema and limited his work in mainstream films, accepting only few offers. After not seeing any success in 1983, the next year, he produced and starred in Girish Karnad&#x27;s critically acclaimed erotic drama &quot;Utsav&quot;. It was filmed in Hindi and English simultaneously, the post-production work of latter version was done in London. He also played a supporting role in K. Bapayya&#x27;s superhit drama film &quot;Ghar Ek Mandir&quot;. In 1985, he appeared in Babbar Subhash&#x27;s &quot;Aandhi-Toofan&quot; and Shakti Samanta&#x27;s &quot;Alag Alag&quot;. While &quot;Aandhi-Toofan&quot; emerged a success, &quot;Alag Alag&quot; flopped at the box office.

1986 proved to be a notable year for Kapoor as he won his first National Award for Best Actor and second BFJA Award for Best Actor (Hindi) for the extraordinary portrayal of an honest journalist in Ramesh Sharma&#x27;s highly acclaimed political thriller &quot;New Delhi Times&quot;. His another major release of the year was Shibu Mitra&#x27;s multi-starrer actioner &quot;Ilzaam&quot; co-starring Shatrughan Sinha, Govinda, Neelam and Anita Raj. The film proved to be a huge hit and also one of the top grossers of the year.

===Final works (1987–1998)===

In 1987, he reunited with Govinda and Neelam for K. Ravi Shankar&#x27;s actioner &quot;Sindoor&quot; which also had Jaya Prada in the lead. He also did a guest appearance in Gulzar&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Ijaazat&quot;. Although &quot;Ijaazat&quot; was a commercial failure, it won massive critical acclaim. On the other hand, &quot;Sindoor&quot; emerged a hit and also proved to be Kapoor&#x27;s last box office success. In 1988, he acted with Pierce Brosnan in &quot;The Deceivers&quot;. The following year, he appeared in films, such as &quot;Farz Ki Jung&quot;, &quot;Gair Kanooni&quot; and &quot;Clerk&quot;, none of which performed well critically or commercially.

Shashi Kapoor requested Amitabh Bachchan to star in his ambitious directorial debut film &quot;Ajooba&quot; (1991). Bachchan made a notable exception and agreed to do the film due to their friendship, even though at the time Amitabh was not signing any new films. Despite having a lavish budget and a huge star cast, the film flopped miserably at the box office. Kapoor also won Special Jury Award for his performance in the 1993 film &quot;In Custody&quot; and played the Rajah in the TV miniseries &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1996).

In 1998, he retired from acting after his final film appearances in &quot;Jinnah&quot;, &quot;Side Streets&quot; and the much delayed &quot;Ghar Bazar&quot;. He was seen in the limelight at the &quot;Shashi Kapoor Film Festival&quot; held in Muscat, Oman (September 2007). At the 55th Annual Filmfare Awards in 2010, Shashi Kapoor received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Personal life==

Kapoor attended Don Bosco High School in Matunga, Mumbai. He met English actress Jennifer Kendal in Calcutta in 1956 while both were working for their respective theatre groups. Shashi was both assistant stage manager as well as an actor for his father&#x27;s theatre group, Prithvi Theatre. Geoffrey Kendal&#x27;s Shakespearean group was also present at the same time in Calcutta and Jennifer was Geoffrey&#x27;s daughter. After their subsequent meeting, the couple fell in love and after facing initial opposition from the Kendals and support from sister-in-law Geeta Bali, they got married in July 1958. They acted in a number of films together, most notably in Merchant Ivory productions. They had three children: Kunal Kapoor, Karan Kapoor and Sanjana Kapoor. Jennifer and Shashi established Prithvi Theatre on 5 November 1978 in Mumbai. Jennifer died of cancer in 1984 which shattered him. After losing her to cancer, Shashi Kapoor fell into a deep depression that he never recovered from. The English actress Felicity Kendal is his sister-in-law.

His eldest son Kunal is married to director Ramesh Sippy&#x27;s daughter. Kunal moved on to ad film direction and established his production house Adfilm-Valas. Shashi&#x27;s daughter Sanjana, is a theatre personality and married to wildlife conservationist Valmik Thapar. They have a son named Hamir. Shashi&#x27;s younger son Karan became successful in modeling and later settled down in London and runs a photography company. His grandson Zahan who is son of Kunal made his debut in &quot;Faraaz&quot; (2023).

Kapoor was admitted to the Kokilaben Hospital, Versova, Mumbai, for what was speculated to be chest infection, and died on 4 December 2017. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he was in hospital for treatment from long-standing liver and heart complications, and was always helping other patients. Officially, his cause of death was attributed to liver cirrhosis. His body was cremated. Kapoor and actress Sridevi, who died in 2018, were the only two Indians honored posthumously in memoriam at the 90th Academy Awards.

== Filmography and awards ==
In 2011, the Government of India honored him with the Padma Bhushan for his contributions to Indian cinema.

==Reception and legacy==
Kapoor is regarded as one of the greatest actors of Indian cinema. Apart from his work in mainstream Hindi films, he is also known for acting and producing several highly acclaimed and award-winning movies belonging to the genre of Parallel cinema, such as &quot;Junoon&quot; (1979), &quot;Kalyug&quot; (1981), &quot;36 Chowringhee Lane&quot; (1981), &quot;Vijeta&quot; (1982) and &quot;Utsav&quot; (1984).

Kapoor&#x27;s deep attachment and commitment to theatre which started in childhood remained almost untouched even when he was immobile due to age-related complications. After renovating Prithvi Theatre in the western part of Mumbai, he was able to successfully create an environment congenial for creative pursuits. The lanes that reach Prithvi Theatre especially in the 1980s were not just routes to the theatre. They were a testimony to principles such as clarity of purpose, commitment to nonconformity and alacrity and utmost willingness to be part of creative process which would have enduring value and which would be incorruptible by market forces. Till date, Prithvi Theatre oozes out an infectious creative energy which can compel people to become dedicated theatre artists and earn a decent living. This has become possible because of consistent efforts of Shashi Kapoor who would be present for special theme-based theatre festivals at the theatre.

Kapoor was of particular note in the Kapoor clan. He has been the solo hero more times (61 films) and also as a lead protagonist in more Hindi films (116) than his nephews Rishi Kapoor, Randhir Kapoor and Rajiv and even more than his brothers Raj Kapoor, Shammi Kapoor, his grand-nephews and grand-nieces. He was also inducted into the Bollywood Walk of Fame at Bandra Bandstand, where his hand print was preserved.

In 2022, he was placed in &quot;Outlook India&quot;″s &quot;75 Best Bollywood Actors&quot; list.

<doc id="265132" wikidata="Q6015473" url="?curid=265132" title="Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio">
<text>The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is a statistic used in cost-effectiveness analysis to summarise the cost-effectiveness of a health care intervention. It is defined by the difference in cost between two possible interventions, divided by the difference in their effect. It represents the average incremental cost associated with 1 additional unit of the measure of effect. The ICER can be estimated as:

:formula_1,

where formula_2 and formula_3 are the cost and effect in the intervention group and where formula_4 and formula_5 are the cost and effect in the control care group. Costs are usually described in monetary units, while effects can be measured in terms of health status or another outcome of interest. A common application of the ICER is in cost-utility analysis, in which case the ICER is synonymous with the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

== Use as a decision rule ==
The ICER can be used as a decision rule in resource allocation. If a decision-maker is able to establish a willingness-to-pay value for the outcome of interest, it is possible to adopt this value as a threshold. If for a given intervention the ICER is above this threshold it will be deemed too expensive and thus should not be funded, whereas if the ICER lies below the threshold the intervention can be judged cost-effective. This approach has to some extent been adopted in relation to QALYs; for example, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) adopts a nominal cost-per-QALY threshold of £20,000 to £30,000. As such, the ICER facilitates comparison of interventions across various disease states and treatments. In 2009, NICE set the nominal cost-per-QALY threshold at £50,000 for end-of-life care because dying patients typically benefit from any treatment for a matter of months, making the treatment&#x27;s QALYs small. In 2016, NICE set the cost-per-QALY threshold at £100,000 for treatments for rare conditions because, otherwise, drugs for a small number of patients would not be profitable. The use of ICERs therefore provides an opportunity to help contain health care costs while minimizing adverse health consequences. Treatments for patients who are near death offer few QALYs simply because the typical patient has only months left to benefit from treatment. They also provide to policy makers information on where resources should be allocated when they are limited. As health care costs have continued to rise, many new clinical trials are attempting to integrate ICER into results to provide more evidence of potential benefit.

==Controversies==
Many people feel that basing health care interventions on cost-effectiveness is a type of health care rationing and have expressed concern that using ICER will limit the amount or types of treatments and interventions available to patients. Currently, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) of England&#x27;s National Health Service (NHS) uses cost-effectiveness studies to determine if new treatments or therapies at the prices proposed by manufacturers provide better value relative to the treatment that is currently in use. With the number of cost-effectiveness studies rising, it is possible for a cost-effectiveness ratio threshold to be established in other countries for the acceptance of reimbursement or formulary listing at a given price. 

Research by the University of York identified that the cost per quality adjusted life year for changes in existing NHS expenditure in 2008 was £12,936 leading to concerns new treatments approved by NICE at £30,000 per quality adjusted life year are less cost-effective than spend on existing treatments. This would mean that diverting NHS spend to new treatments would forgo more than 2 quality adjusted life years for every year gained from the new treatment. 

The concern that ICER may lead to rationing has affected policy makers in the United States. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 provided for the creation of the independent Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The Senate Finance Committee in writing PPACA forbade PCORI from using &quot;dollars-per-quality adjusted life year (or similar measure that discounts the value of a life because of an individual&#x27;s disability) as a threshold to establish what type of health care is cost effective or recommended&quot;.

**A United States Marine Corps AV-8A Harrier crashes spectacularly at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina. During a vertical takeoff the aircraft rolls, drops to the runway, bounces into a ditch, bursts into flames, flips, and slides through a hangar and into a parking lot, where it damages more than 20 vehicles.
**A hijacker commandeers Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 818, a Boeing 727 flying from Stockton to Los Angeles, California, with eight people on board. The hijacker demands to be taken to Iran, but is overpowered by the pilot.
* May 6 – A hijacker takes control of a TAP Air Portugal Boeing 727-172C during a domestic flight in Portugal from Lisbon to Faro and demands to be taken to Switzerland. The airliner diverts to Madrid, Spain, where the hijacker surrenders.
*May 8–12 – Maxie Anderson and his son, Kristian Anderson, make the first nonstop balloon crossing of North America, flying from Fort Baker in California to Sainte-Félicité, Queboon.

* May 28 – A Spanish Air Force Lockheed C-130H Hercules crashes into the cloud-covered mountain Hoya del Gamonal on Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, killing all 10 people on board.

===June===
*European Helicopter Industries is formed.
*Braniff International Airways ends its Concorde service. Inaugurated in January 1979, it involved an interchange service allowing the Concorde to operate over the United States by having Air France and British Airways crews fly the aircraft from Europe to Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia outside Washington, D.C., where the aircraft were temporarily leased and re-registered to Braniff and flown by Braniff crews as Braniff aircraft to Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport. The process was reversed on the return trip, with Braniff crews flying the planes as Braniff aircraft to Washington Dulles, where they were &quot;sold&quot; back and re-registered to Air France and British Airways before being flown back to Europe by French and British crews. Braniff finds that its Concordes generally carry only 15 passengers per trip (about 20 percent of capacity) on the Dallas-Washington route, in sharp contrast to its Boeing 727s, which are full on the same route, and thus decides to discontinue its Concorde operations. Braniff is the only American airline ever to operate the Concorde.
* June 1 – Mauro Milhomem, a Brazilian pilot, attempted to crash his &quot;Sertanejo-721&quot; into the &quot;Hotel Presidente&quot; owned by his mother-in-law, after he had an argument with his wife the previous day after he discovered that she cheated him. The plane failed to hit the target and hit into several objects and ultimately crashed into an accounting office in front to a forum. Six people were killed and four were wounded.
* June 2 – A Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano Fairchild F-27J (registration CP-1117) crashes in the Tapecua Hills near Yacuíba in southern Bolivia, killing all 13 people on board.
* June 8 – A MiG-19 (NATO reporting name &quot;Farmer&quot;) shoots down a TAAG Angola Airlines Yakovlev Yak-40K (registration D2-TYC) near Matala, Angola, killing all 19 people on board. Some reports identify the attacking aircraft as a Zambian Shenyang F-6.
* June 12
**Badly off course after a long detour around a thunderstorm, an Aeroflot Yakovlev Yak-40 (registration CCCP-87689) attempting to descend toward Dushanbe in the Soviet Union&#x27;s Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic crashes into a mountain slope 44 kilometers northwest of Dushanbe Airport, killing all 29 people on board.
**On approach to Lincoln Municipal Airport in Lincoln, Nebraska, Air Wisconsin Flight 965, a Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II (registration N650S) enters an area of very heavy precipitation. Water ingestion causes both engines to lose power simultaneously. The crew restarts them, but the aircraft crashes in a muddy field about north of Valley, Nebraska, killing 13 of the 15 people on board.
* June 13 – The last Concorde to be produced, number 16, is delivered to British Airways.
* June 19 – Sikorsky Aircraft delivers the last of its S-61 commercial helicopters.
* June 23 – Piloting a new aerobatic biplane of the Delhi Flying Club, Sanjay Gandhi, the son of Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi, loses control at the top of a loop he is performing over his office near Safdarjung Airport in New Delhi, India. He and his passenger die in the subsequent crash.
* June 27 – Itavia Flight 870, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15, crashes in the Tyrrhenian Sea near the Italian island of Ustica, killing all 81 people on board. Various theories have been put forward suggesting that the airliner was destroyed in flight by a bomb or was accidentally shot down during a military operation.
* June 30 – A hijacker commandeers an Aerolineas Argentinas Boeing 737-287C during a domestic flight in Argentina from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires, demanding ransom money.

The renewed use of &quot;behavioral profiles&quot; to identify hijackers based on their personalities and behaviors is among the options they consider.
* August 16 – A record three hijackings of U.S. airliners take place on the same day. First, six Latin men threatening to ignite a fluid they said was explosive commandeer Eastern Air Lines Flight 90, a Boeing 727 with 53 people on board flying from Miami to Orlando, Florida. Later in the afternoon, four Latin men armed with bottles they say contain inflammable liquids take control of Republic Airlines Flight 228, a Douglas DC-9 with 116 people on board flying from Miami to Orlando.

Although Peruvian Civil Guard officers fire shots in the air and prevent some refugees from boarding, 168 refugees join 17 passengers on board the airliner, and about another 150 refugees mill around outside the plane. With no crew aboard the DC-8 to fly it anywhere, negotiations result in the refugees surrendering to the Peruvian authorities. Two refugees suffer minor gunshot wounds during the incident when Civil Guard officers fire at them, and other refugees are cut by broken glass while breaking windows in the terminal.
