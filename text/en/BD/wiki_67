<text>Johannes Peter &quot;Honus&quot; Wagner ( ; February 24, 1874 – December 6, 1955), was an American baseball shortstop who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1897 to 1917, mostly with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Nicknamed &quot;the Flying Dutchman&quot; due to his superb speed and German heritage, Wagner was a prototypical five-tool player, known for being a versatile defender who could combine a strong throwing arm with the ability to play almost any defensive position as well as being capable of hitting for average and for power. He is widely regarded as the greatest shortstop of all time. In , the Baseball Hall of Fame inducted Wagner as one of the first five members.

At the age of 15, Wagner began his professional baseball career in the minor leagues in 1889. After being noticed by a talent scout, he made his MLB debut in 1897 with the Louisville Colonels. Wagner excelled at playing any position both in the infield and in the outfield, eventually becoming a regular shortstop by 1903. After the Colonels folded in 1899, club president Barney Dreyfuss bought the Pittsburgh Pirates and brought along Wagner with him, where he would spend the rest of his career. He quickly established himself as the National League&#x27;s premier star. Wagner won a joint-record eight NL batting titles, led the league in slugging six times, stolen bases five times and RBIs four times. With Pittsburgh, Wagner appeared in two World Series, including the inaugural 1903 World Series and 1909 World Series, the latter of which was the Pirates&#x27; first World Series title.

After a brief stint as manager, Wagner retired in 1917 having set numerous MLB career records, including most Wins Above Replacement (WAR; 131.0), extra-base hits (996), most runs scored (1,739), most games played (2,794), most hits (3,420), most total bases (4,870) and most at-bats (10,439), all of which would be broken by Ty Cobb in the following decade. He also retained many other NL career records for up to nearly half a century or more, including most triples (252, still a league record), most stolen bases in the modern era (703) until 1927, most runs scored until 1944, most doubles (640) until 1958 and most hits until 1962. Wagner still ranks in the top 10 for hits, doubles, triples, stolen bases and WAR among all major league players and in the top 10 for games played, at-bats, runs scored, runs batted in and total bases in the NL. 

Wagner remained involved with baseball after retirement, serving as a coach for the Pirates. During his tenure, he helped tutor future Hall of Famers Arky Vaughan and Ralph Kiner. He was widely praised by contemporary players and journalists alike for his playing ability. Wagner is also the subject of the T206 Honus Wagner baseball card, one of the rarest baseball cards in existence. Its production ran from 1909 to 1911, leaving only about 50 known copies in circulation. In 2021, a T206 Honus Wagner sold for $6.6 million, making it the second-most expensive sports card in history.

==Early life==
Wagner was born to German immigrants Peter and Katheryn Wagner in the borough of Chartiers, in what is now Carnegie, Pennsylvania.

Wagner was one of nine children. As a child, he was called Hans by his mother, which later evolved into Honus. &quot;Hans&quot; was also an alternate nickname during his major league career. Wagner dropped out of school at age 12 to help his father and brothers in the coal mines. In their free time, he and his brothers played sandlot baseball and developed their skills to such an extent that three of his brothers went on to become professionals as well.

According to Wagner&#x27;s own testimony, the name &quot;Honus&quot; (pronounced: &quot;HAW-nus&quot;) was a shortened form of &quot;Johannes&quot;, adopted by baseball teammates as a nickname.

Wagner&#x27;s older brother, Albert &quot;Butts&quot; Wagner, who had a brief major league career himself, is often credited with getting Honus his first tryout. Butts persuaded his manager to take a look at his younger brother. Following his brother, Wagner trained to be a barber before becoming successful in baseball.

In 1916, Wagner married Bessie Baine Smith, and the couple had three daughters: Elva Katrina (b. 1918, stillborn), Betty Baine (1919–1992), and Virginia Mae (1922–1985).

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Honus&#x27; brother Albert &quot;Butts&quot; Wagner was considered the ballplayer of the family. Albert suggested Honus in 1895 when his Inter-State League team was in need of help. Wagner played for five teams in that first year, in three different leagues over the course of 80 games.

In 1896, Ed Barrow played with Wagner with the Wheeling Nailers, and decided to take him with him to his next team, the Paterson Silk Sox (Atlantic League). Barrow proved to be a good talent scout, as Wagner could play wherever he was needed, including all three bases and the outfield. Wagner hit .313 for Paterson in 1896 and .375 in 74 games in 1897.

===Louisville Colonels===
Recognizing that Wagner should be playing at the highest level, Barrow contacted the Louisville Colonels, who had finished last in the National League in 1896 with a record of 38–93. They were doing better in 1897 when Barrow persuaded club president Barney Dreyfuss, club secretary Harry Pulliam, and outfielder-manager Fred Clarke to go to Paterson to see Wagner play. Dreyfuss and Clarke were not impressed with the awkward-looking man, not surprising, as Wagner was oddly built: he was tall, weighed , and had a barrel chest, massive shoulders, heavily muscled arms, huge hands, and incredibly bowed legs that deprived him of any grace and several inches of height. Pulliam, though, persuaded Dreyfuss and Clarke to take a chance on him. Wagner debuted with Louisville on July 19 and hit .338 in 61 games.

By his second season, Wagner was already one of the best hitters in the National League although he came up short a percentage point from finishing the season at .300. Following the season, the NL contracted from twelve to eight teams, with the Colonels one of four teams eliminated. Owner Barney Dreyfuss, who had purchased half ownership in the Pirates, took Wagner and many of his other top players with him to the Pittsburgh team.

Tommy Leach recounted his impressions of joining the Louisville club in 1898 with hopes of winning the starting job at third base:

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
The move to the Pittsburgh Pirates signified Wagner&#x27;s emergence as a premier hitter. In 1900, Wagner won his first batting championship with a .381 mark and also led the league in doubles (45), triples (22), and slugging percentage (.573), all of which were career highs. For the next nine seasons, Wagner&#x27;s average did not fall below .330.

In , the American League began to sign National League players, creating a bidding war, which depleted the league of many talented players. Wagner was offered a $20,000 contract by the Chicago White Sox, but turned it down and continued to play with the Pirates.

Prior to 1904, Wagner had played several positions but settled into the shortstop role full-time that season, where he became a skilled fielder. His biography on BaseballBiography.com describes his gritty style:

Bowlegged, barrel-chested, long-limbed ... he was often likened to an octopus. When he fielded grounders, his huge hands also collected large scoops of infield dirt, which accompanied his throws to first like the tail of a comet.

In 1898, Wagner won a distance contest in Louisville by throwing a baseball more than . In August 1899, he became the first player credited with stealing second base, third, and home in succession under the new rule differentiating between advanced bases and stolen bases. He repeated the feat in 1902, 1907, and 1909. Wagner retired with the National League record for most steals of home (27), which was broken by Greasy Neale in 1922.

In September 1905, Wagner signed a contract to produce the first bat with a player&#x27;s signature, the Louisville Slugger, becoming the first sportsperson to endorse a commercial product; the Honus Wagner was to become a best-seller for years. One month later, with one point separating him from Reds center fielder Cy Seymour for the batting title, Wagner fell short in a head-to-head matchup on the final day of the season, with Seymour collecting four hits to Wagner&#x27;s two, as contemporary press reports stated that the fans were far more interested in the Seymour-Wagner battle than in the outcome of the games.

Shortly before the season, Wagner retired. In desperation, owner Barney Dreyfuss offered him $10,000 per year, making him the highest-paid Pirate for many years. He returned to the Pirates early in the 1908 season, and finished two home runs short of the league&#x27;s Triple Crown, leading the league in hitting (for the sixth time)‚ hits‚ total bases‚ doubles‚ triples‚ RBI‚ and stolen bases. Wagner took over the batting lead from the New York Giants&#x27; flamboyant outfielder Mike Donlin during a July 25 game against the Giants and their star pitcher Christy Mathewson. Wagner was 5-for-5 in the game; after each hit, he reportedly held up another finger to Donlin, who went hitless, and who had just beaten runner-up Wagner by a wide margin in a &quot;most popular player&quot; poll.

Bill James cites Wagner&#x27;s 1908 season as the greatest single season for any player in baseball history. He notes that the league ERA of 2.35 was the lowest of the dead-ball era and about half of the ERAs of modern baseball. Since Wagner hit .354 with 109 RBI in an environment when half as many runs were scored as today, he asks, &quot;if you had a Gold Glove shortstop, like Wagner, who drove in 218 runs, what would he be worth?&quot;

He was the first winner of The World&#x27;s Championship Batsman&#x27;s Cup, in 1908, made by Welshman George &quot;Honey Boy&quot; Evans.

===1903 and 1909 World Series===
In , the Pirates played the Boston Americans in Major League Baseball&#x27;s inaugural World Series. Wagner, by this point, was an established star and much was expected of him, especially since the Pirates&#x27; starting rotation was badly depleted by injury. Wagner himself was not at full strength and hit only .222 for the series. The Americans, meanwhile, had some fans, called the &quot;Royal Rooters&quot; who, whenever Wagner came to bat, sang &quot;Honus, Honus, why do you hit so badly?&quot; to the tune of &quot;Tessie&quot;, a popular song of the day. The Rooters, led by Boston bartender Michael &quot;Nuf Ced&quot; McGreevy, even traveled to Pittsburgh to continue their heckling. Pittsburgh lost in the best-of-nine series, five games to three, to a team led by pitchers Cy Young and Bill Dinneen and third baseman–manager Jimmy Collins. Christy Mathewson, in his book &quot;Pitching in a Pinch&quot; wrote: &quot;For some time after &quot;Hans&quot; Wagner&#x27;s poor showing in the world&#x27;s series of 1903 ... it was reported that he was &quot;yellow&quot; (poor in the clutch). This grieved the Dutchman deeply, for I don&#x27;t know a ballplayer in either league who would assay less quit to the ton than Wagner ... This was the real tragedy in Wagner&#x27;s career. Notwithstanding his stolid appearance, he is a sensitive player, and this has hurt him more than anything else in his life ever has.&quot;

Wagner was distraught by his performance. The following spring, he refused to send his portrait to a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; for batting champions, citing his play in the World Series. &quot;I was too bum last year&quot;, he wrote. &quot;I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch? I would be ashamed to have my picture up now.&quot;

Wagner and the Pirates were given a chance to prove that they were not &quot;yellow&quot; in . The Pirates faced Ty Cobb&#x27;s Detroit Tigers. The series was the only meeting of the two superior batsmen of the day, and the first time that the batting champions of each league faced one another (this later occurred three more times, in 1931, 1954, and 2012 World Series). Wagner was by this time 35 years old, Cobb just 22.

This time, Wagner could not be stifled as he outhit Cobb, .333 to .231, and stole six bases, establishing the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: &quot;We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but Silk O&#x27;Loughlin, the umpire, overruled it. We kept the squawk going for a minute or so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O&#x27;Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, &#x27;Of course I was out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let&#x27;s play ball.&#x27;&quot;

There was also a story that was widely circulated over the years and famously recounted in Lawrence Ritter&#x27;s &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, that at one point Cobb was on first; he bragged to Wagner that he was going to steal second and threatened to assault him physically doing it; Wagner defiantly dared him to try it and placed an especially rough tag to Cobb&#x27;s mouth; and the two exchanged choice words. Cobb denied it in his autobiography, and the play-by-play of the 1909 World Series confirms that the event could not have happened as stated: Cobb was never tagged out by Wagner in a caught-stealing. 
The Pirates won the series in seven games behind the pitching of rookie Babe Adams.

===Later career===

In 1910, Wagner&#x27;s average fell to .320, his lowest average since . Nevertheless, he aged exceptionally well; the three highest OPS+ seasons by any shortstop aged 35 or older belong to Wagner, and even his age-41 season ranks eighth on the list.

Wagner won the 1911 batting title by the narrowest of margins. He went hitless in a 1–0 win against the Cubs on May 30, but a successful league protest by the Cubs wiped out the result (and Wagner&#x27;s at-bats). Wagner ended up edging the Boston Rustlers&#x27; Doc Miller, .334 to .333. The Pirates were in contention into August, but an ankle injury sidelined Wagner for 25 games and the team slid from the race.
On June 28, , at age 40, Wagner recorded his 3,000th hit, a single off rookie Cincinnati Reds pitcher Pete Schneider, the second player in baseball history to reach the figure after Cap Anson. Nap Lajoie would join them three months later in the season. This accomplishment, however, came during a down period for Wagner and Pirates. Wagner hit only .252 in 1914, the lowest average of his career. In July 1915, he became the oldest player to hit a grand slam, a record which stood for 70 years until topped by 43-year-old Tony Pérez. In 1916, Wagner became the oldest player to hit an inside-the-park home run.
In , following another retirement, Wagner returned for his final, abbreviated season. Returning in June, he was spiked in July and played only sparingly for the remainder of the year, batting .265. He briefly held the role of interim manager, but after going 1–4, Wagner told owner Dreyfuss the job was not for him. He retired as the NL&#x27;s all-time hit leader, with 3,430. (Subsequent research has since revised this total to 3,418.) It took 45 years for St. Louis&#x27; Stan Musial to surpass Wagner&#x27;s hit total.
Wagner has been considered one of the very best all-around players to ever play baseball since the day he retired in 1917. Baseball historian and statistician Bill James named Honus Wagner as the second-best player of all time after Babe Ruth, rating him as the best major league player in 1900 and each year from 1902 to 1908. Statisticians John Thorn and Pete Palmer rate Wagner as ninth all-time in their &quot;Total Player Ranking&quot;. Many of the greats who played or managed against Wagner, including Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Walter Johnson, list him at shortstop on their All-Time teams.

===Life after baseball===
Wagner was not finished playing baseball after his retirement from major league baseball. He managed and played for a semi-pro team. After retirement, Wagner served the Pirates as a coach for 39 years, most notably as a hitting instructor from to . Arky Vaughan, Ralph Kiner, Pie Traynor (player-manager from –), and Hank Greenberg (although Greenberg was in his final major league season in 1947, his only season with the Pirates, and very well established) all future Hall of Famers, were notable &quot;pupils&quot; of Wagner. During this time, he wore uniform number 14 but later changed it to his more famous 33, which was later the number retired for him. (His entire playing career was in the days before uniform numbers were worn.) His appearances at National League stadiums during his coaching years were always well received and Wagner remained a beloved ambassador of baseball. Wagner also coached baseball and basketball at Carnegie Institute of Technology, which is now part of Carnegie Mellon University.

In 1928, Wagner ran for the office of Sheriff of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, but lost. He was appointed as a deputy of the Allegheny County Sheriff&#x27;s Office in 1942. He also ran a well-known sporting goods company. A sporting goods store bearing the name &quot;Honus Wagner&quot; operated in downtown Pittsburgh for 93 years before closing permanently in 2011.

The Pirates hosted the 1944 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Forbes Field. Wagner was invited to be an honorary coach for the National League squad, the first time this honor was bestowed in Major League Baseball&#x27;s All-Star Game.

Wagner lived the remainder of his life in Pittsburgh, where he was well known as a friendly figure around town. He died on December 6, 1955, at the age of 81, and he is buried at Jefferson Memorial Cemetery in the South Hills area of Pittsburgh.

===Film legacy===
Wagner, along with his famous baseball card, was one of the earliest athletes to make the crossover into pop culture film. He starred as a sports hero in 1919&#x27;s &quot;Spring Fever&quot; with Moe Howard and Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges, and has been depicted as the subject of &quot;The Winning Season&quot; (2004) and in a brief scene in &quot;Cobb&quot; (1994).

===Baseball legacy===

When the Baseball Hall of Fame held its first election in 1936, Wagner tied for second in the voting with Babe Ruth, trailing Cobb. A 1942 &quot;Sporting News&quot; poll of 100 former players and managers confirmed this opinion, with Wagner finishing 43 votes behind Cobb and six ahead of Ruth. In 1969, on the 100th anniversary of professional baseball, a vote was taken to honor the greatest players ever, and Wagner was selected as the all-time shortstop. In 1999, 82 years after his last game and 44 years since his death, Wagner was voted Number 13 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Players, where he was again the highest-ranking shortstop. That same year, he was selected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team by the oversight committee, after losing out in the popular vote to Cal Ripken Jr. and Ernie Banks.

Christy Mathewson asserted that Wagner was the only player he faced who did not have a weakness. Mathewson felt that the only way to keep Wagner from hitting was not to pitch to him.

&quot;A stirring march and two-step&quot;, titled &quot;Husky Hans&quot;, and &quot;respectfully dedicated to Hans Wagner, Three-time Champion Batsman of The National League&quot; was written by William J. Hartz in 1904.

Bill James says that Wagner is easily the greatest shortstop of all time, noting that the difference between Wagner and the second greatest shortstop, in James&#x27; estimation Arky Vaughan, is roughly the same as the gulf between Vaughan and the 20th greatest shortstop.

Wagner is mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash.

A life-size statue of Wagner swinging a bat, atop a marble pedestal featuring admiring children, was forged by a local sculptor named Frank Vittor, and placed outside the left-field corner gate at Forbes Field. It was dedicated on April 30, 1955, and the then-frail Wagner was well enough to attend and wave to his many fans. The Pirates have relocated twice since then, and the statue has come along with them. It now stands outside the main gate of PNC Park. The statue roughly faces the site of the Pirates&#x27; original home, Exposition Park, so in a sense, Wagner has come full circle.

Wagner is honored in the form of a small stadium residing behind Carnegie Elementary School on Washington Avenue in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. The stadium serves as the home field for Carlynton High School varsity sports. The Historical Society of Carnegie History Center houses the Honus Wagner Sports Museum which includes many Wagner collectibles and memorabilia. Visitors receive replicas of the famous card.

In the 1992 episode &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, the popular TV show The Simpsons made a reference to Wagner. The character Mr. Burns lists three ringers he wants for his company&#x27;s baseball team, but they are Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, and &quot;Mordecai &#x27;Three Fingers&#x27; Brown&quot;. His assistant has to point out that they are not only retired but long-dead ... Anson having played in the late 19th century.

In 2000, Wagner was honored with a U.S. postage stamp. The stamp was issued as part of a &quot;Legends of Baseball&quot; series that honored 20 all-time greats in conjunction with MLB&#x27;s All-Century team.

===T206 Baseball card===

The T206 Honus Wagner baseball card is one of the rarest and most expensive baseball cards in the world, as only 57 copies are known to exist. The card was designed and issued by the American Tobacco Company (ATC) from 1909 to 1911 as part of its T206 series. While sources allege that Wagner, a nonsmoker, refused to allow the production of his baseball card to continue, the more likely reason was the sum ATC was willing to pay Wagner. The ATC ended production of the Wagner card and a total of only 57 to 200 cards were ever distributed to the public, as compared to the &quot;tens or hundreds of thousands&quot; of T206 cards, over three years in 16 brands of cigarettes, for any other player. In 1933, the card was first listed at a price value of US $50 in Jefferson Burdick&#x27;s &quot;The American Card Catalog&quot;, making it the most expensive baseball card at the time.

The typical card in the T206 series had a width of and a height of . Some cards were awkwardly shaped or irregularly sized, which prompted a belief that many of the cards in the series had been altered at one point or another. In his work &quot;Inside T206: A Collector Guide to the Classic Baseball Card Set&quot;, Scot A. Reader wrote that, &quot;It is not at all uncommon to find T206 examples that have been altered at some point during their near-century of existence.&quot; These discrepancies were taken advantage of by &quot;card doctors&quot; who trimmed corners and dirty edges to improve the appearance of the card. The front of all T206 series cards, including the Wagner card, displayed a lithograph of the player created by a multi-stage printing process in which a number of colors were printed on top of each other to create a lithograph with the appropriate design. The backs of the cards featured the monochromatic colors of the 16 tobacco brands for which the cards were printed. The Wagner cards in particular advertised the Piedmont and Sweet Caporal brands of cigarettes and were produced at Factory 25 in Virginia, as indicated by the factory stamp imprinted on the back of the cards.

Starting from January 1909, the ATC sought authorization from baseball players for inclusion in the T206 series, which featured 524 major league players, 76 of whom were later inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Wagner had been at the top of his game throughout the decade and was even considered the game&#x27;s greatest player at the time. He had appeared on advertisements for a number of other products such as chewing gum, gunpowder, and soft drinks. Unsurprisingly, the ATC asked for Wagner&#x27;s permission to have his picture on a baseball card. According to an October 12, 1912, issue of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, Wagner did not give his consent to appear on the baseball card. In response to the authorization request letter sent by John Gruber, a Pittsburgh sportswriter hired by the ATC to seek Wagner&#x27;s permission, Wagner wrote that he &quot;did not care to have his picture in a package of cigarettes&quot;. He threatened to seek legal action against ATC if they went ahead and created his baseball card.

A near mint-mint condition T206 Wagner card sold in 2007 for $2.8 million, the highest price ever for a baseball card. In 2010, a previously unknown copy of the card was donated to the School Sisters of Notre Dame in Baltimore. The card, which was in poor condition, sold in November 2010 to a collector for $262,000, well over the $150,000 that was expected at auction. The card came with Sister Virginia Muller&#x27;s brother&#x27;s handwritten note: &quot;Although damaged, the value of this baseball card should increase exponentially throughout the 21st century!&quot;

On April 20, 2012, a New Jersey resident purchased a VG-3 graded T206 Wagner card for more than $1.2 million.

On April 6, 2013, a 1909–11 T206 baseball card featuring Honus Wagner sold at auction for $2.1 million.

On October 1, 2016, a T206 Wagner card graded PSA-5 sold for $3.12 million, setting yet again the record for the highest price paid for any baseball card.

On May 29, 2019, a Honus Wagner T-206 sold for $1.2 million by SCP Auctions in Southern California. The same card had been previously auctioned for $657,250 in 2014 and $776,750 in 2016. The encapsulated card was rated as only a 2 on a scale to 10.

In May 2021, one example sold for a new record $3.75 million. In doing so, it became the second most expensive baseball card sold at auction at the time.

In August 2021, another example sold for $6.6 million exceeding the previous high for most valuable sports card at the time.

On August 3, 2022, a T206 Honus Wagner was sold in a private sale for a sports card record high of $7.25 million, eclipsing the previous high of $6.6 million.

The card featured in the plot of the Nickelodeon film &quot;Swindle&quot;.

<text>In accounting, a current asset is an asset that can reasonably be expected to be sold, consumed, or exhausted through the normal operations of a business within the current fiscal year, operating cycle, or financial year. In simple terms, current assets are assets that are held for a short period. 

Current assets include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments in companies in the process of being sold, accounts receivable, stock inventory, supplies, and the prepaid liabilities that will be paid within a year. Such assets are expected to be realised in cash or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business. On a balance sheet, assets will typically be classified into current assets and long-term fixed assets. 

The current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. It is frequently used as an indicator of a company&#x27;s accounting liquidity, which is its ability to meet short-term obligations. The difference between current assets and current liability is referred to as trade working capital.

The quick ratio, or acid-test ratio, measures the ability of a company to use its near-cash or quick assets to extinguish or retire its current liabilities immediately. Quick assets are those that can be quickly turned into cash if necessary and may not be used for a substantial period of time such as twelve months.

<doc id="265292" wikidata="Q1761731" url="?curid=265292" title="Book value">
<text>In accounting, book value (or carrying value) is the value of an asset according to its balance sheet account balance. For assets, the value is based on the original cost of the asset less any depreciation, amortization or impairment costs made against the asset. Traditionally, a company&#x27;s book value is its minus intangible assets and liabilities. However, in practice, depending on the source of the calculation, book value may variably include goodwill, intangible assets, or both. The value inherent in its workforce, part of the intellectual capital of a company, is always ignored. When intangible assets and goodwill are explicitly excluded, the metric is often specified to be &quot;tangible book value&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the term net asset value may refer to the book value of a company.

==Asset book value==
An asset&#x27;s initial book value is its actual cash value or its acquisition cost. Cash assets are recorded or &quot;booked&quot; at actual cash value. Assets such as buildings, land and equipment are valued based on their acquisition cost, which includes the actual cash cost of the asset plus certain costs tied to the purchase of the asset, such as broker fees. Not all purchased items are recorded as assets; incidental supplies are recorded as expenses. Some assets might be recorded as current expenses for tax purposes. An example of this is assets purchased and expensed under Section 179 of the U.S. tax code.

===Depreciable, amortizable and depletable assets===
Monthly or annual depreciation, amortization and depletion are used to reduce the book value of assets over time as they are &quot;consumed&quot; or used up in the process of obtaining revenue. These non-cash expenses are recorded in the accounting books &quot;after&quot; a trial balance is calculated to ensure that cash transactions have been recorded accurately. Depreciation is used to record the declining value of buildings and equipment over time. Land is not depreciated. Amortization is used to record the declining value of intangible assets such as patents. Depletion is used to record the consumption of natural resources.

Depreciation, amortization and depletion are recorded as expenses against a contra account. Contra accounts are used in bookkeeping to record asset and liability valuation changes. &quot;Accumulated depreciation&quot; is a contra-asset account used to record asset depreciation.

Sample general journal entry for depreciation
* Depreciation expenses: building... debit = $150, under expenses in retained earnings
* Accumulated depreciation: building... credit = $150, under assets

The balance sheet valuation for an asset is the asset&#x27;s cost basis minus accumulated depreciation. Similar bookkeeping transactions are used to record amortization and depletion.

&quot;Discount on notes payable&quot; is a contra-liability account which decreases the balance sheet valuation of the liability.

When a company sells (issues) bonds, this debt is a long-term liability on the company&#x27;s balance sheet, recorded in the account Bonds Payable based on the contract amount. After the bonds are sold, the book value of Bonds Payable is increased or decreased to reflect the actual amount received in payment for the bonds. If the bonds sell for less than face value, the contra account Discount on Bonds Payable is debited for the difference between the amount of cash received and the face value of the bonds.

==Net asset value==
In the United Kingdom, the term net asset value may refer to book value.

A mutual fund is an entity which primarily owns &quot;financial assets&quot; or capital assets such as bonds, stocks and commercial paper. The net asset value of a mutual fund is the market value of assets owned by the fund minus the fund&#x27;s liabilities. This is similar to shareholders&#x27; equity, except the asset valuation is market-based rather than based on acquisition cost. In financial news reporting, the reported net asset value of a mutual fund is the net asset value of a single share in the fund. In the mutual fund&#x27;s accounting records, the financial assets are recorded at acquisition cost. When assets are sold, the fund records a capital gain or capital loss.

Financial assets include stock shares and bonds owned by an individual or company. These may be reported on the individual or company balance sheet at cost or at market value.

==Corporate book value==
A company or corporation&#x27;s book value, as an asset held by a separate economic entity, is the company or corporation&#x27;s shareholders&#x27; equity, the acquisition cost of the shares, or the market value of the shares owned by the separate economic entity.

A corporation&#x27;s book value is used in fundamental financial analysis to help determine whether the market value of corporate shares is above or below the book value of corporate shares. Neither market value nor book value is an unbiased estimate of a corporation&#x27;s value. The corporation&#x27;s bookkeeping or accounting records do not generally reflect the market value of assets and liabilities, and the market or trade value of the corporation&#x27;s stock is subject to variations.

==Tangible common equity==
A variation of book value, tangible common equity, has recently come into use by the U.S. federal government in the valuation of troubled banks.&lt;ref name = &quot;WSJ-2/23/09&quot;&gt;&quot;US Eyes Large Stake in Citi&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, 23 February 2009,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT-2/24/09&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;Stress Test for Banks Exposes Rift on Wall St.&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 24 February 2009,&lt;/ref&gt; Tangible common equity is calculated as total book value minus intangible assets, goodwill, and preferred equity, and can thus be considered the most conservative valuation of a company and the best approximation of its value should it be forced to liquidate.

Since tangible common equity subtracts preferred equity from the tangible book value, it does a better job estimating what the value of the company is to holders of specifically &quot;common&quot; stock compared to standard calculations of book value.

==Stock pricing book value==
To clearly distinguish the market price of shares from the core ownership equity or shareholders&#x27; equity, the term &quot;book value&quot; is often used since it focuses on the values that have been added and subtracted in the accounting books of a business (assets – liabilities). The term is also used to distinguish between the market price of any asset and its accounting value which depends more on historical cost and depreciation. It may be used interchangeably with carrying value. While it can be used to refer to the business&#x27; total equity, it is most often used: 
*As a &quot;per share value&quot;: The balance sheet equity value is divided by the number of shares outstanding at the date of the balance sheet (not the average o/s in the period).
*As a &quot;diluted per share value&quot;: The equity is bumped up by the exercise price of the options, warrants or preferred shares. Then it is divided by the number of shares that has been increased by those added.

===Uses of books===
#Book value is used in the financial ratio price/book. It is a valuation metric that sets the floor for stock prices under a worst-case scenario. When a business is liquidated, the book value is what may be left over for the owners after all the debts are paid. Paying only a price/book = 1 means the investor will get all his investment back, assuming assets can be resold at their book value. Shares of capital intensive industries trade at lower price/book ratios because they generate lower earnings per dollar of assets. Business depending on human capital will generate higher earnings per dollar of assets, so will trade at higher price/book ratios.
#Book value per share can be used to generate a measure of comprehensive earnings, when the opening and closing values are reconciled. BookValuePerShare, beginning of year – Dividends + ShareIssuePremium + Comprehensive EPS = BookValuePerShare, end of year.

===Changes are caused by===
#The sale of shares/units by the business increases the total book value. Book/sh will increase if the additional shares are issued at a price higher than the pre-existing book/sh.
#The purchase of its own shares by the business will decrease total book value. Book/shares will decrease if more is paid for them than was received when originally issued (pre-existing book/sh).
#Dividends paid out will decrease book value and book/sh.
#Comprehensive earnings/losses will increase/decrease book value and book/sh. Comprehensive earnings, in this case, includes net income from the Income Statement, foreign exchange translation changes to Balance Sheet items, accounting changes applied retroactively, and the opportunity cost of options exercised.

===New share issues and dilution===
The issue of more shares does not necessarily decrease the value of the current owner. While it is correct that when the number of shares is doubled the EPS will be cut in half, it is too simple to be the full story. It all depends on how much was paid for the new shares and what return the new capital earns once invested. See the discussion at stock dilution.

===Net book value of long term assets===
Book value is often used interchangeably with &quot;net book value&quot; or &quot;carrying value&quot;, which is the original acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation, depletion or amortization. Book value is the term which means the value of the firm as per the books of the company. It is the value at which the assets are valued in the balance sheet of the company as on the given date.

<text>Weiach is a municipality in the district of Dielsdorf in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland.

==History==

Weiach is first mentioned in 1271. It has belonged to Swiss Confederation since 1424. Since 1962 there has been a gravel industry located in Weiach. On 14 November 1990, Alitalia Flight 404 crashed into Stadlerberg Mountain near Weiach while attempting to land at Zurich Airport. The crash, which was caused by a faulty navigation system, killed all 40 passengers and 6 crew.

==Geography==
Weiach has an area of . Of this area, 36.9% is used for agricultural purposes, while 49.5% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 11.7% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (1.9%) is non-productive (rivers, glaciers or mountains).

Weiach (dialect: «Weych») is situated at approximately 390 metres above sea level in the northwestern corner of the Zürich Lowlands («Zuercher Unterland»), at the cantonal boundary between Zürich and Aargau. The River Rhine, flows some 100 meters north of the village and forms the natural border line to Germany, marking the lowest spot in the canton of Zürich (332 meters above sea level).

==Population==

The Zürich Tax Records (&quot;Zürcher Steuerbücher&quot;) of 1470 only contains a record of the manor of Weiach. At the time, the village comprised 16 households, with 48 inhabitants over the age of 15 liable to pay tax. Between 1634 and 1760, having been requested to do so by the Zürich authorities, the priests kept detailed records of population size, albeit with sporadic intervals. Later figures have been taken from the following sources: 1790 Werdmüller&#x27;s Memorabilia Tigurina, 1799 Priests&#x27; Inquiry of the Helvetian Government, 1820 Erni&#x27;s Memorabilia Tigurina, 1827 Lutz&#x27;s &quot;Vollständige Beschreibung des Schweizerlandes&quot;. The figure for 1836 is based on the Zürich cantonal census. Figures from 1850 onwards have been taken from the Confederational Census. (The criteria for recording population data have changed considerably over the centuries. Each interpretation can cause the figures to vary considerably. The figures are taken from different sources. For the years 1710 to 1820, data are hardly available.)

Over the centuries, the population size has been closely linked to the profitability of the land, since exports were rare. The resident population oscillated between 500 and 750 persons, making Weiach the largest parish in Neuamt. From the end of the 17th Century onwards, many began to look for work outside Weiach, resulting in emigration. This emigration was often to the United States. Many of the forefathers of Americans with the surname &quot;Baumgardner&quot; were originally from Weiach.

By the 1960s and 1970s, a few new apartment blocks had been built here and there. In the wake of the agglomeration of Zürich, Weiach became subsumed by the city in the mid 1980s. New residential areas were designated according to the &quot;Quartierpläne&quot;. This triggered a construction boom, beginning on the edge of Sanzenberg. 30 per cent of the apartments which existed in 2000 had been built in the previous ten years. The population grew by over 35 per cent thanks to the building of 80 new apartment blocks between 1991 and 2000. Never before had so many people lived simultaneously in the parish of Weiach. The start of urbanisation can be seen from the explosion in the number of single person households from 1990 (an increase of 132 per cent).

A large-scale construction project was planned at the end of 2007 to build a further 55 apartment blocks in the Bedmen area. If this goes ahead, the population figure will again pass the 1000 mark.

===Demographics===
Weiach has a population (as of ) of . , 10.1% of the population was made up of foreign nationals. Over the last 10 years the population has grown at a rate of 6.9%. Most of the population () speaks German (93.6%), with Albanian being second most common ( 1.5%) and Serbo-Croatian being third ( 1.2%).

In the 2007 election the most popular party was the SVP which received 54.8% of the vote. The next three most popular parties were the SPS (12.9%), the CSP (9.4%) and the FDP (8%).

The age distribution of the population () is children and teenagers (0–19 years old) make up 26.7% of the population, while adults (20–64 years old) make up 61% and seniors (over 64 years old) make up 12.4%. In Weiach about 80.4% of the population (between age 25-64) have completed either non-mandatory upper secondary education or additional higher education (either university or a &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;).

Weiach has an unemployment rate of 2.46%. , there were 47 people employed in the primary economic sector and about 17 businesses involved in this sector. 120 people are employed in the secondary sector and there are 16 businesses in this sector. 96 people are employed in the tertiary sector, with 27 businesses in this sector.

<doc id="265298" wikidata="Q10942803" url="?curid=265298" title="Girl Guide and Girl Scout">
<text>A Girl Guide or Girl Scout is a member of a section of some Guiding organisations who is between the ages of 10 and 14. Age limits are different in each organisation. Robert Baden-Powell chose to name his organization for girls &quot;the Girl Guides&quot;. In the United States and several East Asian countries the term &quot;Girl Scout&quot; is used instead. Female scouts go under the name of &quot;girl scouts&quot; in many more languages. The two terms are used synonymously within this article.

Girl Guides are organised into units/troops averaging 15–30 girls under guidance of a team of leaders. Units subdivide into patrols of about six Guides and engage in outdoor and special interest activities. Units may affiliate with national and international organisations. Some units, especially in Europe, have been co-educational since the 1970s, allowing boys and girls to work together as Scouts. There are other programme sections for older and younger girls.

==Foundation==

Following the origin of the Boy Scouts in 1907 many girls took up Scouting. A group of Girl Scouts were prominent at the Crystal Palace Rally in 1909. After Robert Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in 1910 he formed the Girl Guides and asked his sister Agnes to look after the Girl Guides organisation. A few years later Baden-Powell&#x27;s new wife Olave St. Claire Baden-Powell (commonly referred to as &quot;Lady Baden-Powell&quot;) became involved and, in 1918, was appointed Chief Guide.

==Activities==

Most activities are now similar to those of the (Boy) Scouts, but when the movement started two central themes were present: domestic skills and &quot;a kind of practical feminism which embodies physical fitness, survival skills, camping, citizenship training, and career preparation&quot;.
==Unit affiliation==

===Troop===

Local groups, called variously units, companies or troops, are the fundamental unit of the Girl Guides. These are run by an adult, normally a woman who is between 18 and 65 years of age. She has responsibility for the girls in her group and plans out activities for the girls as well as leading the meetings. These leaders are supported by assistants. Meetings are held anywhere from weekly to monthly depending on the commitments of the participants and the activities in progress.

<text>Tapper, also known as Root Beer Tapper, is an arcade video game developed by Marvin Glass and Associates and released in 1984 by Bally Midway. &quot;Tapper&quot; puts the player in the shoes of a bartender who must serve eager, thirsty patrons (before their patience expires) while collecting empty mugs and tips. It was distributed in Japan by Sega in 1984.

Originally sponsored by Anheuser-Busch, the arcade version features a Budweiser motif. It was intended to be sold to bars, with cabinets sporting a brass rail footrest and drink holders. Early machines had game controllers that were actual Budweiser beer tap handles, which were later replaced by smaller, plastic versions with the Budweiser logo on them. The re-themed &quot;Root Beer Tapper&quot; followed in 1984, which was developed specifically for arcades because the original version was construed as advertising alcohol to minors.

==Gameplay==
The controls consist of a four-position joystick and a tap handle. The game screen features four bars, each with a keg at one end and a door at the other. Customers enter through the doors and slowly advance toward the kegs, demanding service. The player controls a bartender who must pour drinks and slide them down the bar for the customers to catch. Pushing the joystick up or down instantly moves the bartender to the keg at the next bar in the chosen direction, with the top and bottom of the screen wrapping around to one another, while pushing left or right causes him to run along the bar where he is stationed. When the tap handle is pulled down, the bartender instantly moves to the keg (if he is not already standing there) and fills a mug; releasing it causes him to slide the mug along the bar.


Customers slide back toward the doors upon catching a full mug, and they disappear through the doors if they are close enough. If they are too far away from a door, they stop, consume the drink, and resume their advance while sliding the empty mug back toward the keg. Customers occasionally leave tips on the bar, which the player can pick up for bonus points. Collecting a tip causes a group of female dancers to appear for a few seconds, distracting a portion of the customers so that they will stop advancing. However, distracted customers cannot catch drinks, and any customers who are either drinking or being pushed back at the start of the dancers&#x27; show will never be distracted.

One life is lost when any of the following occurs:
* The player fails to catch an empty mug before it falls off the keg end of a bar and breaks.
* A full mug slides to the door end of a bar without being caught, where it falls and breaks.
* Any customer reaches the keg end of a bar, whereupon they grab the bartender and slide him across the bar out the door.

Each screen is completed when the bar is completely emptied of customers. The bartender then pours/consumes a drink of his own with humorous results involving the empty mug, such as getting it stuck on his head or stubbing his toe when he tries to kick it. As the game progresses, the customers appear more frequently, move faster along the bar, and are pushed back shorter distances when they catch their drinks. In addition, the maximum number of customers per bar gradually increases until every bar can have up to four customers at a time.

The player proceeds through four levels, each with its own theme and appropriately dressed customers, and must complete a set number of screens to advance from one level to the next. The levels are:

# A western saloon with cowboys (2 screens)
# A sports bar with athletes (3 screens)
# A punk rock bar with punk rockers (4 screens)
# An outer-space bar with aliens (4 screens)

A bonus round is played after the end of each level, in which six cans of beer (or root beer) are placed on the bar. A masked figure shakes five of the cans, then pounds the bar to shuffle them. Choosing the one unshaken can awards bonus points, while choosing any other results in the bartender being sprayed in the face; in the latter case, the unshaken can flashes briefly to indicate its position.

After completing all four levels, the player returns to the start of the sequence and continues the game at a higher difficulty level.

==Music==
Music and sound effects for the arcade version of &quot;Tapper&quot; were created by Rick Hicaro of Marvin Glass &amp; Associates. He used a Synclavier II synthesizer running with custom software written by Richard Ditton. The system interfaced directly to the arcade game system so sounds were true to the capabilities of the hardware.

The game&#x27;s score includes &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot; (composed by Stephen Foster), &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; (traditional American folk song), the Budweiser theme, and &quot;Galop Infernal&quot; by Jacques Offenbach. The rest of the music was written by Rick Hicaro.

==Ports==
&quot;Tapper&quot; was ported to the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 5200, Atari 2600, BBC Micro, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, IBM PC, and Amstrad CPC. Most of the home versions of &quot;Tapper&quot; featured the Mountain Dew logo, while the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions had the Pepsi logo, but they retained the bartender character of the original arcade game instead of the soda jerk in &quot;Root Beer Tapper&quot;.

The ColecoVision version was released in 1984.

The &quot;Root Beer Tapper&quot; version also appears on the Midway Legacy Edition Arcade1Up cabinet.

A version for Commodore Amiga has been released in 2023.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Tapper&quot; on their March 15, 1984 issue as being the most-successful table arcade unit of the month, tied with &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; and &quot;Vs. Tennis&quot;.

&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; called the Commodore 64 version of &quot;Tapper&quot; &quot;one of the most addictive games we&#x27;ve seen lately ... not only fun to play, but also immensely challenging, graphically entertaining, and full of action&quot;. The magazine stated that &quot;it&#x27;s a very well-designed strategy game&quot;, and concluded that it was &quot;near the top in entertainment value&quot;. Sinclair User gave the game a &quot;SU Classic&quot; award.

==Legacy==
The art style is almost identical to a previous game called &quot;Domino Man&quot;, and the following game &quot;Timber&quot;. In fact, the main character in &quot;Timber&quot; is a rework of the main character in &quot;Tapper&quot;. The art is based on Mike Ferris, an artist who taught Scott Morrison art.

===Re-releases===
&quot;Root Beer Tapper&quot; has been included in several compilations. It was in the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Midway&#x27;s Greatest Arcade Hits&quot;, &quot;Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Midway Collection 2&quot; for the PlayStation, &quot;Midway Arcade Treasures&quot; for PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows, and &quot;Midway Arcade Origins&quot; for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

A reinterpretation of the game for mobile devices, &quot;Tapper World Tour&quot;, was released in 2011.

===Clones===
Novasoft published a clone in 1984 called &quot;Brew Master&quot; for the TRS-80 Color Computer. A slightly altered version of &quot;Tapper&quot; appears as the &quot;Milk Bar&quot; minigame in &quot;Barnyard&quot; (2006). A similar version is on the virtual pet website &quot;Neopets&quot; as one of the minigames for the &quot;Altador Cup&quot; event.

A clone called &quot;Nuka Tapper&quot; is included in &quot;Fallout 76&quot; as a minigame with &quot;Fallout&quot;-themed graphics.

===In popular culture===
&quot;Tapper&quot; is one of the games included in Disney&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; and its 2018 sequel &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; with the bartender voiced by Maurice LaMarche. The version of the game featured in both the films is a combination of the Budweiser and rootbeer versions.

===High score===
Gregory Erway set the tournament world record on June 5, 2005 with a score of 3,162,125 (first 5 men of game). William Rosa set the marathon world record on February 16, 2019 with a score of 14,826,200.

<text>Forchheim is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Bamberg, Bayreuth, Nürnberger Land and Erlangen-Höchstadt.

==History==
Until 1803 the region was divided between the clerical state of Bamberg and the margravate of Brandenburg-Kulmbach centred in Bayreuth. Then it fell to Bavaria. The district in its present borders was established in 1972 by merging the former district of Forchheim with parts of the dissolved districts of Ebermannstadt and Pegnitz. The city of Forchheim lost its status as a district-free city and became the capital.

==Geography==
The main river is the Regnitz, which runs from south to north through the western parts of the district. East of the river the land rises to the hills of the Frankish Alb.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the lion of the clerical state of Bamberg
* the key is from the arms of the county of Schlüsselberg; these counts possessed many castles in the region, but their property was acquired by the bishops of Bamberg in the 14th century
* the trout symbolises the city of Forchheim (the word &quot;Forchheim&quot; literally could mean &quot;home of the trouts&quot; (=Forelle or old German Forche); however, most of the historians consider the name Forchheim coming more probably from &quot;home of the pine trees&quot; (= Föhre, which is the most frequent tree in this region).

<doc id="265307" wikidata="Q1513578" url="?curid=265307" title="Weather modification">
<text>Weather modification is the act of intentionally manipulating or altering the weather. The most common form of weather modification is cloud seeding, which increases rainfall or snowfall, usually for the purpose of increasing the local water supply. Weather modification can also have the goal of preventing damaging weather, such as hail or hurricanes, from occurring; or of provoking damaging weather against an enemy, as a tactic of military or economic warfare like Operation Popeye, where clouds were seeded to prolong the monsoon in Vietnam. Weather modification in warfare has been banned by the United Nations under the Environmental Modification Convention.

==History==
A popular belief in Northern Europe was that shooting prevents hail, which thus caused many agricultural towns to fire cannons without ammunition. Veterans of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Napoleonic wars, and the American Civil War reported that rain fell after every large battle. After their stories were collected in &quot;War and Weather&quot;, the United States Department of War in the late 19th century purchased $9,000 of gunpowder and explosives to detonate them in Texas, in hopes of condensing water vapor into rain. The results of the test, supervised by Robert Dyrenforth, were inconclusive.

Wilhelm Reich performed cloudbusting experiments in the 1950s, the results of which are controversial and were not widely accepted by mainstream science.

In November 1954 the Thailand Royal Rainmaking Project (Thai: โครงการฝนหลวง) was initiated by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He discovered that many areas faced the problem of drought. Over 82 percent of Thai agricultural land relied on rainfall. Thai farmers were not able to grow crops for lack of water. The royal rainmaking project debuted on 20 July 1969 at his behest, when the first rainmaking attempt was made at Khao Yai National Park. Dry ice flakes were scattered over clouds. Reportedly, some rainfall resulted. In 1971, the government established the Artificial Rainmaking Research and Development Project within the Thai Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.

In January 2011, several newspapers and magazines, including the UK&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;Arabian Business&quot;, reported that scientists backed by the government of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, had created over 50 artificial rainstorms between July and August 2010 near Al Ain, a city which lies close to the country&#x27;s border with Oman and is the second-largest city in the Abu Dhabi Emirate. The artificial rainstorms were said to have sometimes caused hail, gales and thunderstorms, baffling local residents.

In the run up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, the Chinese Government said they could control precipitation to some extent and that the Games would not be hampered by bad weather conditions. For this purpose they established a government office called the Beijing Weather Modification Office, which is under the national weather control office.

==Cloud seeding==
Cloud seeding is a common technique to enhance precipitation. Cloud seeding entails spraying small particles, such as silver iodide, onto clouds to attempt to affect their development, usually with the goal of increasing precipitation. Cloud seeding only works to the extent that there is already water vapor present in the air. Critics generally contend that claimed successes occur in conditions which were going to lead to rain anyway. It is used in a variety of drought-prone countries, including the United States, China, India, and Russia. In China, there is a perceived dependency upon it in dry regions, and there is a strong suspicion it is used to &quot;wash the air&quot; in dry and heavily polluted places, such as Beijing. In mountainous areas of the United States such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, cloud seeding has been employed since the 1950s.

Project Cirrus was an attempt by General Electric to modify the weather which ran from 1947-1952. During that time, under the supervision of the United States Air Force, attempts were made to create snowstorms and seed hurricanes by using silver iodide. While General Electric reported positive results, they also acknowledged that their experiments were controversial.

The United Arab Emirates has been cloud seeding since the 2000s and aims to increase rainfall by 15-30% per year. The materials used are potassium chloride, sodium chloride, magnesium, and other materials.

=== Consequences ===
==== Societal ====
Not having adequate systems to handle weather modification may have disastrous consequences. &quot;In the city of Jeddah in Western Saudi Arabia was damaged by floods in 2009 that reportedly killed more than 100 people; igniting questions of why the country doesn&#x27;t have effective drainage systems in place.&quot;

==== Human ====
The U.S. National Library of Medicine notes that the silver iodide has no known &quot;ill effects&quot; on people, although people&#x27;s &quot;hands may have remained yellowed for weeks&quot; after being exposed to it.

==Storm prevention==

Project Stormfury was an attempt to weaken tropical cyclones by flying aircraft into storms and seeding the eyewall with silver iodide. The project was run by the United States Government from 1962 to 1983. A similar project using soot was run in 1958, with inconclusive results. Various methods have been proposed to reduce the harmful effects of hurricanes. Moshe Alamaro of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology proposed using barges with upward-pointing jet engines to trigger smaller storms to disrupt the progress of an incoming hurricane; critics doubt the jets would be powerful enough to make any noticeable difference.

Alexandre Chorin of the University of California, Berkeley, proposed dropping large amounts of environmentally friendly oils on the sea surface to prevent droplet formation. Experiments by Kerry Emanuel of MIT in 2002 suggested that hurricane-force winds would disrupt the oil slick, making it ineffective. Other scientists disputed the factual basis of the theoretical mechanism assumed by this approach.

The Florida company Dyn-O-Mat and its CEO, Peter Cordani, proposed the use of a patented product it developed, called Dyn-O-Gel, to reduce the strength of hurricanes. The substance is a polymer in powder form (a polyacrylic acid derivative) which reportedly has the ability to absorb 1,500 times its own weight in water. The theory is that the polymer is dropped into clouds to remove their moisture and force the storm to use more energy to move the heavier water drops, thus helping to dissipate the storm. When the gel reaches the ocean surface, it is reportedly dissolved. Peter Cordani teamed up with Mark Daniels and Victor Miller, the owners of a government contracting aviation firm AeroGroup which operated ex-military aircraft commercially. Using a high altitude B-57 Bomber, AeroGroup tested the substance dropping 9,000 pounds from the B-57 aircraft&#x27;s large bomb bay and dispersing it into a large thunderstorm cell just off the east coast of Florida. The tests were documented on film and made international news showing the storms were successfully removed on monitored Doppler radar. In 2003, the program was shut down because of political pressure through NOAA. Numerical simulations performed by NOAA showed however that it would not be a practical solution for large systems like a tropical cyclone.

Hail cannons have been used by some farmers since the 19th century in an attempt to ward off hail, but there is no reliable scientific evidence to confirm their effectiveness. Another new anti-hurricane technology is a method for the reduction of tropical cyclones&#x27; destructive force – pumping sea water into and diffusing it in the wind at the bottom of such tropical cyclones in its eye wall.

==Hurricane modification==

NOAA published a page addressing various ideas in regard to tropical cyclone manipulation.

In 2007, &quot;How to stop a hurricane&quot; explored various ideas such as:
* Using lasers to discharge lightning in storms which are likely to become hurricanes
* Pouring liquid nitrogen onto the sea to deprive the hurricane of heat energy.
* Creating soot to absorb sunlight and change air temperature and create convection currents in the outer wall.
Researchers from NOAA&#x27;s hurricane research division addressed hurricane control based ideas.

Later ideas (2017) include laser inversion along the same lines as laser cooling (normally used at cryogenic temperatures) but intended to cool the top 1mm of water. If enough power were to be used then it may be enough, combined with computer modelling, to form an interference pattern able to inhibit a hurricane or significantly reduce its strength by depriving it of heat energy.

Other proposals for hurricane modification include the construction of a large array of offshore wind turbines along the East Coast of the United States. Such turbines would have the dual purpose of generating plentiful energy whilst also reducing the power of oncoming hurricanes before they make landfall.

===Pumping up deep ocean waters to cool the surface===

Pumping up colder deep ocean water in front of a tropical storm to cool the sea surface skin temperature could be a technique used to fight hurricanes in the Atlantic before they develop into major hurricanes.

It is purely speculative and difficult to realize since placing such pumps in the path of a hurricane would be difficult. Furthermore, any such project would need a large number of them to upwell enough water to cool a large enough sea surface area to have any effectiveness. That is without counting the large amount of energy needed to power those pumps and its effects on marine life.

==In military==

Operation Popeye was a highly classified operation run by the US military from 1967-1972. The purpose was to prolong the monsoon in Southeast Asia. The overwhelming precipitation successfully disrupted the tactical logistics of the Vietnamese army. Operation Popeye is believed as the first successful practice of weather modification technology in warfare. After it was unveiled, weather modification in warfare was banned by the Environmental Modification Convention (ENMOD).

In &quot;Benign Weather Modification&quot; published in March 1997, Air Force Major Barry B. Coble superficially documents the existence of weather modification science where he traces the developments that have occurred, notably, in the hands of the Pentagon and CIA&#x27;s staunchest ideological enemies.

* The first scientifically controlled and monitored effort generally recognized by the meteorological community as constituting weather modification occurred in 1948. When Dr. Irving Langmuir first experimented with artificially seeding clouds to produce rain in New Mexico, his experiments showed positive results – sparking tremendous interest in the field nearly overnight.
* Many countries throughout the world practice weather modification. The Russians have long been interested in using weather modification as a way to control hail.

In the 1990s a directive from the chief of staff of the Air Force Ronald R. Fogleman was issued to examine the concepts, capabilities, and technologies the United States would require to remain the dominant air and space force in the future.

==In law==
===US and Canada agreement===
In 1975, the US and Canada entered into an agreement under the auspices of the United Nations for the exchange of information on weather modification activity.

===1977 UN Environmental Modification Convention===

Weather modification, particularly hostile weather warfare, was addressed by the &quot;United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72, TIAS 9614 Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.&quot; The Convention was signed in Geneva on May 18, 1977; entered into force on October 5, 1978; ratified by U.S. President Jimmy Carter on December 13, 1979; and the U.S. ratification deposited in New York on January 17, 1980.

===US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration===
In the US, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration keeps records of weather modification projects on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, under the authority of Public Law 92-205, 15 USC § 330B, enacted in 1971.

===Proposed US legislation===

U.S. Senate Bill 517 and U.S. House Bill 2995 were two bills proposed in 2005 that would have expanded experimental weather modification, to establish a Weather Modification Operations and Research Board, and implemented a national weather modification policy. Neither was made into law.

Senate Bill 1807 and House Bill 3445, identical bills introduced July 17, 2007, proposed to established a Weather Mitigation Advisory and Research Board to fund weather modification research

=== Passed Tennessee legislation ===
Tennessee bill HB 2063/SB 2691 was signed into law on April 11, 2024. This bill bans the &quot;intentional injection, release, or dispersion&quot; of chemicals within Tennessee &quot;with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of the sunlight.&quot;

The text of the bill doesn&#x27;t explicitly reference the chemtrail conspiracy theory, but the sponsor of the bill, Sen. Steve Southerland said that it is one of the intended targets of the bill.

==In religion and mythology==

Magical and religious practices to control the weather are attested in a variety of cultures. In ancient India, it is said that yajna or Vedic rituals of chanting mantras and offerings were performed by rishis to bring sudden bursts of rainfall in rain starved regions. Some Indigenous Americans, like some Europeans, had rituals which they believed could induce rain. 

The early modern era saw people observe that during battles the firing of cannons and other firearms often initiated precipitation.

In Greek mythology, Iphigenia was offered as a human sacrifice to appease the wrath of the goddess Artemis, who had becalmed the Achaean fleet at Aulis at the beginning of the Trojan War. In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Aeolus, keeper of the winds, bestowed Odysseus and his crew with a gift of the four winds in a bag. However, the sailors opened the bag while Odysseus slept, looking for booty (money), and as a result, were blown off course by the resulting gale. In ancient Rome, the &quot;lapis manalis&quot; was a sacred stone kept outside the walls of Rome in a temple of Mars. When Rome suffered from drought, the stone was dragged into the city.
The Berwick witches of Scotland were found guilty of using black magic to summon storms to murder King James VI of Scotland by seeking to sink the ship upon which he travelled. Scandinavian witches allegedly claimed to sell the wind in bags or magically confined into wooden staves; they sold the bags to seamen who could release them when becalmed. In various towns of Navarre, prayers petitioned Saint Peter to grant rain in times of drought. If the rain was not forthcoming, the statue of St Peter was removed from the church and tossed into a river.

In the Hebrew Bible, it is recorded that Elijah in the way of judgement, told King Ahab that neither dew nor rain would fall until Elijah called for it. It is further recorded that the ensuing drought lasted for a period of 3.5 years at which time Elijah called the rains to come again and the land was restored. The New Testament records Jesus Christ controlling a storm by speaking to it.

In Islam, Salat Al-Istisqa’ (Prayer for Rain) is taken as a recourse when seeking rain from God during times of drought.

== Conspiracy theories ==

Weather modification, along with climate engineering, is a recurring theme in conspiracy theories. The chemtrail conspiracy theory supposes that jet contrails are chemically altered to modify the weather and other phenomena. Other theories attempt to implicate scientific infrastructure such as the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP).

== Popular Culture ==
Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; series features weather control technology, mainly on two planets: Arrakis, where the technology is used by the Fremen to assure privacy from observation and hide their true population and their plans to terraform the planet from the Imperium; and, Chapterhouse, where the Bene Gesserit intend to turn the planet into a desert.

The ability to manipulate the weather has become a common superpower in superhero fiction. A notable example is the Marvel Comics character Storm.

In the children&#x27;s book &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot;, the fictional town of Chewandswallow has weather that rains down food instead of actual rain or snow, which becomes so extreme it forces its citizens to move to a different town. This was adapted into a movie where Flint Lockwood, the town&#x27;s outcast and scientist, has created a machine that converts water from the clouds into food.

In the Star Trek franchise, the United Federation of Planets has weather modification technology, in addition to terraforming capabilities.

<text>The Regnitz () is a river in Franconia, Germany. It is a left tributary of the Main and is in length.

The river is formed by the confluence of the rivers Rednitz and Pegnitz, which meet in the city of Fürth. From there the Regnitz runs northwards through the cities of Erlangen and Forchheim. It finally meets the Main near the city of Bamberg. Including its source rivers Rednitz and Franconian Rezat, it is long, providing the furthest source (and hence length) of the Main&#x27;s river system, the largest and longest right bank tributary of the river Rhine.

Small portions of the Regnitz near Bamberg are incorporated into a canal connecting the Main with the Danube: the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal, which otherwise runs parallel from Bamberg to Fürth.

Between Fürth and Forchheim many norias for drawing water up were used from the Middle Ages until the 19th century. Some are still there or were reconstructed.

The origin of the name is uncertain. The first written evidence of the name refers to a large farm on the river. It is first mentioned in a Latin document from 1160 as Rekinzi. It may be based on Slavic Rakonica (&#x27;crab river&#x27;).

<text>British Cameroons or British Cameroon was a British mandate territory in British West Africa, formed of the Northern Cameroons and Southern Cameroons. Today, the Northern Cameroons forms parts of the Borno, Adamawa and Taraba states of Nigeria, while the Southern Cameroons forms part of the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon.

==History==
The area of present-day Cameroon was claimed by Germany as a protectorate during the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; at the end of the 19th century. The German Empire named the territory Kamerun. During World War I, French and British troops invaded the German colony Kamerun (Present day Cameroon) and decided to divide the German colony into two regions. One of the regions would be French administered (French Cameroon) and the other would be British administered (British Cameroons). The British were more concerned with other areas of Africa, specifically Nigeria. Thus, the French gained a larger portion of Cameroon when the country was divided.

===League of Nations mandate===
During World War I, it was occupied by British, French and Belgian troops, and a later League of Nations mandate to Great Britain and France by the League of Nations in 1922. The French mandate was known as Cameroun and the British territory was administered as two areas, &quot;Northern Cameroons&quot; and &quot;Southern Cameroons&quot;. Northern Cameroons consisted of two non-contiguous sections, divided by a point where the Nigerian and Cameroun borders met. In the 1930s, most of the white population consisted of Germans, who were interned in British camps starting in June 1940. The native population of 400,000 showed little interest in volunteering for the British forces; only 3,500 men did so.

===Trust territory===
When the League of Nations ceased to exist in 1946, most of the mandate territories were reclassified as United Nations trust territories, henceforth administered through the United Nations Trusteeship Council. The object of trusteeship was to prepare the lands for eventual independence. The United Nations approved the Trusteeship Agreements for British Cameroons to be governed by Britain on 6 December 1946.

=== Colonial legacy ===
Under colonial rule, Cameroons was ruled on the basis of indirect rule which allowed natives to execute judicial and executive decisions. The British in Cameroons used indirect rule because it meant that Cameroonians would comply willingly rather than having to coercively force compliance. This was important because it gave citizens of British Cameroons autonomy and helped to establish “a greater vitality of local political institutions in West Cameroon”. Despite the indirect rule used to invigorate the spirit of citizens, the British found that they had to &quot;approach various developmental programs&quot; because &quot;there was little involvement of the local people in planning and executing community development programmes.&quot;

In British Cameroons, European immigrants were subject to the laws of their home country while natives of Cameroons were held to customary law which was typically overseen by British administrators.

The legal system established during the colonial era continues to be implemented, specifically, customary laws and the two legal systems. As the community development programmes grew, there was a large delay in educational efforts because British Cameroons &quot;. . .had no secondary school in the territory.&quot; Secondary education was largely the work of missionaries such as St. Joseph College which opened in Sasse, Buea, in 1939.

===Independence===
As French Cameroon gained independence, British Cameroons was still under the administration of Nigeria. French Cameroun became independent, as Cameroun or Cameroon, on January 1, 1960, and Nigeria was scheduled for independence later that same year, which raised the question of what to do with the British territory. As colonizers of Nigeria, the British desired for the two to be united. After some discussion (which had been going on since 1959), a UN-administered plebiscite was agreed to and held on 11 February 1961. The Muslim-majority Northern Area opted for union with Nigeria, and the Southern Area voted to join Cameroon. No option was given for British Cameroonian independence. The driving force for the unification of east and south Cameroon was Ahmadou Ahidjo and the Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP) as the French were not concerned because southern Cameroon did not align with the French community established.

Upon reunification with French Cameroon, Anglophone Cameroonians &quot;made up about 20% of the federal population…their French counterparts made up a majority at 80 percent&quot;.

Northern Cameroons became the Sardauna Province of Northern Nigeria on 1 June 1961, while Southern Cameroons became West Cameroon, a constituent state of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, later that year on 1 October 1961.

The Separatist Ambazonia movement seeks to create an independent state out of the Cameroonian portion of British Cameroons arguing that it&#x27;s anglophone population is persecuted by the francophone population of the rest of Cameroon.

<text>(known as Kuririn in Funimation&#x27;s English subtitles and Viz Media&#x27;s release of the manga, and Klilyn in Japanese merchandise English translations) is a fictional character in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is introduced in chapter #25 &quot;A Rival? Arrival!!&quot;, first published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on May 21, 1985, as Goku&#x27;s fellow martial arts student under Master Roshi. As the series progresses, Krillin becomes Goku&#x27;s closest ally and best friend as he fights every villain along with Goku or before him and is often depicted as the comic relief.

== Design and appearance ==
Toriyama originally created Krillin along with the &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot; as a method to help add depth to the story, as his editor Kazuhiko Torishima had stated that the series&#x27; protagonist, Goku, was too plain. Torishima explained that in order to develop Goku&#x27;s characterization, they needed someone petty and mischievous to provide contrast, thus leading to the introduction of Krillin. Yūsuke Watanabe, who wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, had originally written the film to take place at Krillin and Android #18&#x27;s wedding, but Toriyama wrote it to take place at Bulma&#x27;s birthday party. Watanabe thought Toriyama made the change because he wanted fans to imagine the wedding for themselves. Toriyama cited Krillin and Bulma&#x27;s older ages at the end of the manga as a reason he chose for &quot;Battle of Gods&quot; to take place after the Buu arc since they were in their &quot;strongest condition at that time.&quot;

Krillin&#x27;s appearance stays relatively the same for the majority of the series. He is first introduced at age 13, with a shaved head and still dressed in the yellow-and-orange clothing worn at the monastery at which he had been training. He does not possess a visible nose, and has six spots of moxibustion burns on his forehead called &quot;jieba&quot;, a reference to the practice of Shaolin monks. Toriyama once stated, seemingly humorously, that Krillin&#x27;s lack of a nose is because he has a &quot;physical idiosyncrasy&quot; that allows him to breathe through the pores of his skin. Later, he wears the orange &quot;gi&quot; uniform that is presented to both himself and Goku by Master Roshi in honor of their first martial arts competition. Occasionally he is seen in casual clothes, but for the most part continues to dress for training or fighting at all times. During the Frieza arc, he wears Saiyan armor provided by Vegeta, but during the Cell arc he returns to wearing the orange &quot;gi&quot;, accompanied by a blue short-sleeved undershirt and boots. After the defeat of Cell, Krillin stops shaving his head, and grows his black hair out, before later shaving it again during Frieza&#x27;s resurrection. When he settles down with his family, Krillin is shown wearing a workout outfit consisting of a red &quot;Tacos&quot; T-shirt and brown drawstring pants.

== Appearances ==

=== In &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; ===
Krillin first appears arriving at Master Roshi island to become his apprentice, meeting Son Goku, and the two become rivals. However, after doing the hardships that Roshi assigns, the two become friends. After finishing their training, Roshi has Krillin and Goku compete in the 21st &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;. Krillin beats the odored fighter Bacterian, who uses his stench as a weapon, and makes it to the semi-finals. However, he is defeated by Jackie Chun, who is really Roshi in disguise preventing his students from becoming arrogant with too many victories. Krillin continues to train with Roshi and helps Goku to collect the Dragon Balls by fighting against General Blue and participating in Baba Uranai&#x27;s tournament. However, he is quickly defeated by Dracula Man, who bites down on his head, causing blood to pour out. Three years later, Krillin enters the 22nd &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;. Again, he makes it to the semi-finals by defeating Chiaotzu, but loses to Goku. Soon after, Krillin is killed by a henchman of Piccolo Daimao, who wanted to steal Goku&#x27;s Dragon Ball. After Goku defeats Piccolo, Krillin is revived by the Dragon Balls. Another 3 years later, Krillin enters the 23rd &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;. This time however, he only makes it to the quarter-finals, losing to Piccolo Jr. Krillin then tries to intervene in the fight between Piccolo and Goku when Piccolo gains the upper hand, until realizing he is outclassed.

Several years later, in the span of a day, Krillin is attacked by Raditz while attending a reunion, and is unable to save Gohan from Piccolo, who takes him for training. A year afterward, Krillin confronts the Saiyan invaders Vegeta and Nappa along with his friends, following months of training in preparation for their arrival. After Yamcha&#x27;s death, he avenges his friend by killing most of the Saibamen. In the battle against Nappa, Krillin tries to get involved in his fight with Tien Shinhan after Nappa severs the latter&#x27;s arm, though is stopped by Nappa. Krillin double teams Nappa with Piccolo, creating multiple copies of themselves with the &quot;Tri-Form&quot; and failing thanks to the clones cutting their power. Krillin later goes toe-to-toe with Nappa alone, launching a &quot;Kienzan&quot; at him that Nappa almost catches before Vegeta warns him, and is saved from an attack from Nappa by Piccolo. After Nappa is defeated, and Goku arrives, Krillin requests that he fight Vegeta elsewhere to prevent their friends&#x27; corpses from being destroyed. He and Gohan leave the battlefield but return after Gohan worries for Goku, who is being crushed by Vegeta in his Oozaru form. Krillin unsuccessfully attempts cutting Vegeta&#x27;s tail in a sneak attack, and later is given the &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; to launch at Vegeta by Goku, which misses initially but is bounded back by Gohan. After Vegeta yields from further conflict given his extensive injuries, Krillin takes Yajirobe&#x27;s sword and moves in to kill him, but agrees to spare his life per Goku&#x27;s request. He then travels with Gohan and Bulma to planet Namek to use the Namekian Dragon Balls to revive their dead friends, since the Earth&#x27;s Dragon Balls vanished due to Piccolo&#x27;s death. Once there, they save a young Namekian called Dende from death at the hands of Frieza&#x27;s henchmen. Krillin receives an increase in power from Guru, the grand elder of the Namekians, when he unlocks his hidden potential. After a few close encounters with Vegeta, Krillin and Gohan are forced to team up with him in order to fight Frieza&#x27;s strongest warriors, the Ginyu Force. They are overpowered by them until Goku arrives and defeats the Force. After Krillin and Gohan collect the seven Dragon Balls and wish back Piccolo, they begin a battle against Frieza, during which Krillin is stabbed in the chest, removes Frieza&#x27;s tail following being healed by Dende, thereby distracting Frieza from continuing to crush Gohan to death, and injures Vegeta in an attempt to capitalize on his Saiyan ability to grow stronger when in a near-death state at Vegeta&#x27;s request. After a long fight between Goku and Frieza, Goku decides to use the &quot;Genki-Dama&quot;, Krillin giving his energy to Piccolo so he can stall Frieza and attacking Frieza himself with his last bit of strength. When the group recovers from the &quot;Genki-Dama&quot;, and Frieza emerges unscathed, the latter detonates Krillin from the inside, killing him instantly, which triggers Goku&#x27;s first ever transformation into a Super Saiyan. After Frieza&#x27;s defeat, Krillin is revived by the Namekian Dragon Balls.

Krillin trains for three years to confront Doctor Gero who tries to use his androids to kill Goku. Krillin is momentarily forced to leave his friends with the androids to take Yamcha away from the battlefield in the aftermath of his deadly encounter with Gero, who Krillin finds the base of and signals the others to his location after having a fight with Gero. When the Androids, #16, #17 and #18 are released, Krillin is the only hero present that does not engage #17 and #18 due to his fear. After the duo defeat his friends, Krillin unsuccessfully pleads for the androids to spare Goku&#x27;s life, and becomes infatuated with the female #18 after she kisses him on the cheek, and he then heals his defeated friends. After Krillin encounters the artificial life form Cell, Krillin and Future Trunks travel to Doctor Gero&#x27;s laboratory basement, where Krillin kills the present timeline version of Cell and the two discover the weakness to the androids is a deactivating controller, which Bulma constructs and gives to Krillin. Krillin soon after encounters #18 with the module and after a period of deliberation, destroys it. Because of this, regardless of his efforts, Cell absorbs her and achieves his perfect form. Enraged over her loss, Krillin engages Cell in combat, the latter standing in place while Krillin&#x27;s attacks have no effect and striking Krillin only once, placing Krillin in a near-death state. After Krillin is revived by Trunks, he warns Trunks of Cell&#x27;s strength, having been able to sense his true power right before being attacked. He moves Vegeta away from the impending fight between Trunks and Cell, healing Vegeta during the battle between the two. He later participates in the Cell Games, a martial arts tournament created by Cell for entertainment, and fights one of the Cell Juniors who attack him and his friends, but is saved by Gohan. After Gohan punches Cell in the stomach, he regurgitates Android #18 and Krillin cares for her comatose body while Gohan destroys Cell. After Cell&#x27;s death, Krillin then travels to the lookout, where he uses the second wish from the Dragon Balls to remove the bombs from #17 and #18.

Seven years later, Krillin has quit fighting, settled down with #18, with whom he has a daughter named . This left Goku confused, until Krillin explained that Android 18 is a cyborg (meaning she is human still), and she was able to have a baby with him. However, after learning of Goku&#x27;s return from the afterlife to compete in the 25th &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, he decides to also participate, also being encouraged to do so for the money by #18. During Goten and Trunks&#x27; match, Krillin worries that Trunks&#x27; energy attack will hit the crowd. Krillin wins his sole match, against Pintar, during the competition with ease. After the Kaioshin enlists several of Krillin&#x27;s friends to help him defeat the wizard Babidi, Krillin joins them, in doing so forfeiting his entry in the tournament, but is stopped from assisting any further thanks to Dabura turning him into stone with his spit. Upon Dabura&#x27;s death however, Krillin is freed and he saves Goten and Trunks from the impact of Vegeta&#x27;s self-explosion. Krillin later evacuates Earth after Majin Buu&#x27;s awakening. When Buu has transformed, he finds the temple and locate Krillin and his friends. After escaping the &quot;Room of Spirit and Time&quot;, he kills everyone present; in the anime, Krillin is the first to be killed after trying in vain to distract Buu so his friends can retreat. During Goku and Vegeta&#x27;s fight against Buu, Krillin is brought back to life by the Namekian Dragon Balls and gives his energy to Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; attack, which is used to destroy Buu.

=== In &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; ===
In the film, &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, Krillin attends Bulma&#x27;s birthday party; he later backs down from engaging Beerus due to not knowing his power. He then watches Goku&#x27;s battle with the god. In &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot;, Krillin works as a police officer and after having his head shaven by Android 18, joins in the fight against the resurrected Frieza afterward, being one of the survivors of Earth&#x27;s second destruction before its reversal by Whis.

After the events of the last two films, Krillin assists in acquiring two more members for his universe&#x27;s team in a tournament, namely Piccolo and Majin Buu, after learning about it from Android #18 and reunites with Trunks, who he tries to stop from attacking Android #18 when she greets him, revealing her as his wife. #18 tries to get Krillin a gift with the Dragon Balls until being convinced by Bulma her presence alone is good enough for him, and Krillin later participates in a baseball game between Universes 6 and 7. Krillin tries stopping a pair of wrongdoers when he is knocked out by an arriving Gohan in his Saiyaman guise. Krillin agrees to train with Goku after some reluctance and the two travel to get Paradise Grass from an island, encountering large, physical versions of past enemies that Krillin becomes fearful of. The two are revealed to be in the &quot;Forest of Fear&quot;, Krillin saving Goku from a phantom of Super Shenron that the two destroy together. Krillin is requested by Goku and Gohan for participation in the Tournament of Power; he accepts. Krillin eliminates Universe 4&#x27;s Shosa and Majora before being eliminated himself by Frost. Krillin&#x27;s shouts of encouragement for Android 18 contribute to her victory over Universe 2&#x27;s Ribrianne, and he feeds Vegeta a Senzu Bean after his elimination by Universe 11&#x27;s Jiren.

Krillin later appears in a flashback after Frieza intends to provoke the wild Saiyan, Broly, into becoming a Super Saiyan, remembering the time that he murdered Krillin that sparked Goku&#x27;s own transformation on Namek. He then promptly kills Broly&#x27;s father, Paragus, in order to initiate the transformation in Broly, who was fighting Goku at the time.

== Voice actors ==

Krillin is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka in the original Japanese anime and in all related media, with the only exception being in &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot;, where a mini version of Krillin was voiced by Aki Kanada. Toriyama chose Tanaka after hearing her portrayal of the protagonist Giovanni in the film &quot;Night on the Galactic Railroad&quot;. When Krillin and Yajirobe, another character voiced by Tanaka, appeared in the same scenes, she gave the latter a Nagoya dialect in order to distinguish them.

Canadian actress-musician Wanda Nowicki performed the English voice of Krillin (here named Bongo) in the rare Harmony Gold dub of &quot;Mystical Adventure&quot;.

When the series&#x27; full production was taken over by Funimation in the US, Krillin was voiced by Laurie Steele as a child in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and Sonny Strait as an adult in all media released to the US. Strait got cast as the role following his audition in Texas. He found the character&#x27;s constant deaths amusing and thought him comical: &quot;Krillin is the party. If you don’t wish back the party, you’re going to be bored.&quot; Other English voice actors include Sharon Mann, Brian Beacock, and Julie Maddalena.

Lacking the other protagonists&#x27; advantage of getting stronger every time he is injured, Krillin is however the strongest Earthling and was recognized as having a great array of techniques by Vegeta. In the later parts of the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; series, Krillin learns to improve and develop variants of his &quot;Kienzan&quot; and &quot;Solar Flare&quot; techniques, giving him a tactical edge in battle.

== Reception ==
Krillin is a popular character in the series; in 2004 Japanese fans voted him the seventh most popular character. In January 2007, Oricon held a poll in which they asked Japanese fans of manga and anime which characters from any series they would most like to see in spin-off series. Krillin ranked third in the men&#x27;s poll and sixth in the overall poll. In 2016, Krillin was ranked No. 3 on the saikoplus.com list &quot;10 Most Popular Characters in Dragon Ball Z&quot;. When younger fans would belittle the character as weak, Krillin&#x27;s voice actress Mayumi Tanaka said she would explain to them that Krillin and Yamcha are the strongest earthlings, the other characters are all aliens. She also said it was more fun to play Krillin when he was a dirty-minded bad kid, that she was not fond of him growing his hair out and was shocked when he died for the first time. Manga author Masashi Kishimoto said that when creating the protagonist of his series &quot;Naruto&quot;, Krillin was more influential than Goku because the former came across as more human than the protagonist as he showed several flaws.

Various publications for manga, anime and other media have commented on Krillin&#x27;s character, adding praise and criticism to his development and traits in the series. Anime News Network writer Carl Kimlinger liked Krillin and Goku&#x27;s childhood, noting it to be the warmth that the later &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime does not have. Also believing the first anime to have more development than the sequel, Tim Jones from Them Anime Reviews cited how Krillin was not a friend to Goku when first introduced. David F. Smith of IGN comments that Krillin and #18&#x27;s relationship really help make the storyline more interesting. Additionally, he liked Krillin&#x27;s appearances in the fight against Cell as he has more screen time than the main character, Goku. Although Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment thought that Krillin had a drastic change in &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, he mentioned that fans from the previous series would like some of its episodes due to the appearance of Krillin and other older characters.

<text>An expense is an item requiring an outflow of money, or any form of fortune in general, to another person or group as payment for an item, service, or other category of costs. For a tenant, rent is an expense. For students or parents, tuition is an expense. Buying food, clothing, furniture, or an automobile is often referred to as an expense. An expense is a cost that is &quot;paid&quot; or &quot;remitted&quot;, usually in exchange for something of value. Something that seems to cost a great deal is &quot;expensive&quot;. Something that seems to cost little is &quot;inexpensive&quot;. &quot;Expenses of the table&quot; are expenses for dining, refreshments, a feast, etc.

In accounting, &quot;expense&quot; is any specific outflow of cash or other valuable assets from a person or company to another person or company. This outflow is generally one side of a trade for products or services that have equal or better current or future value to the buyer than to the seller. Technically, an expense is an event in which a proprietary stake is diminished or exhausted, or a liability is incurred. In terms of the accounting equation, expenses reduce owners&#x27; equity. The International Accounting Standards Board defines expenses as:

Expense is a term also used in sociology, in which a particular fortune or price is sacrificed voluntarily or involuntarily by something or someone to something or somebody else, often in the context that the latter is taking advantage of the former.

==Bookkeeping for expenses==
In double-entry bookkeeping, expenses are recorded as a debit to an expense account (an income statement account) and a credit to either an asset account or a liability account, which are balance sheet accounts. An expense decreases assets or increases liabilities. Typical business expenses include salaries, utilities, depreciation of capital assets, and interest expense for loans. The purchase of a capital asset such as a building or equipment is not an expense.

==Cash flow==
In a cash flow statement (flow of funds statement), expenditures are divided into three categories:

* Operating: Operational expense – salary for employees
* Investing: Capital expenditure – buying equipment
* Expenditures (financial) Financing expense – interest expense for loans and bonds

Whether a particular expenditure is classified as an expense, which is reported immediately on the business&#x27;s income statement or whether it is classified as a capital expenditure (or an expenditure subject to depreciation), which is not an expense flow of funds statement. Though, these latter types of expenditures are reported as expenses when they are depreciated by businesses that use accrual-basis accounting- as most large businesses and all C corporations do.

Defining an expense as capital or income using the most common interpretation depends upon its term.

When an expense is seen as a purchase, it alleviates this distinction. Soon after the purchase (that which was expenses holds no value), it is usually identified as an expense. It will be viewed as capital with life that should be amortized/depreciated and retained on the balance sheet if it retains value soon and long after the purchase.

==Deduction of business expenses under the United States tax code==
For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Code permits the deduction of business expenses in the tax payable year in which those expenses are paid or incurred. This is in contrast to capital expenditures that are paid or incurred to acquire an asset. Expenses are costs that do not acquire, improve, or prolong the life of an asset. For example, a person who buys a new truck for a business would be making a capital expenditure because they have acquired a new business-related asset. This cost could not be deducted in the current taxable year. However, the gas the person buys during that year to fuel that truck would be considered a deductible expense. The cost of purchasing gas does not improve or prolong the life of the truck but simply allows the truck to run.

Even if something qualifies as an expense, it is not necessarily deductible. As a general rule, expenses are deductible if they relate to a taxpayer&#x27;s trade or business activity or if the expense is paid or incurred in the production or collection of income from an activity that does not rise to the level of a trade or business (investment activity).

Section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for business or trade expenses. In order to be a trade or business expense and qualify for a deduction, it must satisfy 5 elements in addition to qualifying as an expense. It must be (1) ordinary and (2) necessary (&quot;Welch v. Helvering&quot; defines this as necessary for the development of the business at least in that they were appropriate and helpful). Expenses paid to preserve one&#x27;s reputation do not appear to qualify). In addition, it must be (3) paid or incurred during the taxable year. It must be paid (4) in carrying on (meaning not prior to the start of a business or in creating it) (5) a trade or business activity. To qualify as a trade or business activity, it must be continuous and regular, and profit must be the primary motive. An expense can be a loss or profit. But the loss or profit need not really be an expense.

Section 212 of the Internal Revenue Code is the deduction provision for investment expenses. In addition to being an expense and satisfying elements 1-4 above, expenses are deductible as an investment activity under Section 212 of the Internal Revenue Code if they are (1) for the production or collection of income, (2) for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production of income, or (3) in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax.

In investing, one controversy that mounted throughout 2002 and 2003 was whether companies should report the granting of stock options to employees as an expense on the income statement, or should not report this at all in the income statement, which is what had previously been the norm.

==Expense report==
An expense report is a form of document that contains all the expenses that an individual has incurred as a result of the business operation. For example, if the owner of a business travels to another location for a meeting, the cost of travel, the meals, and all other expenses that he/she has incurred may be added to the expense report. Consequently, these expenses will be considered business expenses and are tax-deductible.

Many businesses benefit from automated expense reports systems for expense management. Depending on the system chosen, these software solutions can reduce time costs, errors, and fraud.

==Expense management==
Expense management is a crucial aspect of both personal and corporate financial well-being. It involves effectively tracking, controlling, and optimizing expenses to ensure financial stability and growth. Whether for individuals or organizations, understanding and managing expenses is essential for various reasons.

On a personal level, expense management enables individuals to maintain a healthy financial life. By tracking and categorizing expenses, individuals gain a clear understanding of where their money is going. This awareness allows for better budgeting, saving, and investing decisions. It empowers individuals to make informed choices about their spending habits, prioritize financial goals, and avoid unnecessary debt. There are outstanding mobile applications that makes personal expense management handy, notably SMoney that are available in both iOS and Android Versions.

For businesses, effective expense management is vital for maintaining financial health and achieving long-term success. By closely monitoring and controlling expenses, businesses can optimize their operational costs and improve profitability. Expense management helps identify areas of overspending, inefficiencies, or potential cost savings. It allows for strategic decision-making, such as resource allocation, investment planning, and pricing strategies. Moreover, proper expense management ensures compliance with financial regulations and enhances transparency in financial reporting. Whilst there are a plethora of corporate finance and expense management apps, it is notable that Odoo and Expense.com.hk are free and simple to use. Other platforms, including Workstem and InfoTech requires an upfront payment plus relatively complex setup procedures.

In both personal and corporate contexts, expense management contributes to financial stability and resilience. It helps individuals and businesses weather unexpected expenses, emergencies, or economic downturns. By establishing sound financial habits and practices, individuals can build a strong foundation for their future. Similarly, organizations with effective expense management have better cash flow management, which enhances their ability to invest, expand, and adapt to changing market conditions.

<text>Thalion Software was formed by members of the Atari ST demoscene in October 1988, in Gütersloh, Germany. The main aim of Thalion Software was to produce cutting edge technology games. Despite the technical quality, sales of the games never really matched expectations and by the end of 1994 the developers had left and the company eventually closed. The two founders were Erik Simon (of The Exceptions) and Holger Flöttmann. Flöttmann later went on to found another video games company, Ascaron.

<text>Cost of goods sold (COGS) (also cost of products sold (COPS), or cost of sales) is the carrying value of goods sold during a particular period.

Costs are associated with particular goods using one of the several formulas, including specific identification, first-in first-out (FIFO), or average cost. Costs include all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs that are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Costs of goods made by the businesses include material, labor, and allocated overhead. The costs of those goods which are not yet sold are deferred as costs of inventory until the inventory is sold or written down in value.

==Overview==
Many businesses sell goods that they have bought or produced. When the goods are bought or produced, the costs associated with such goods are capitalized as part of inventory (or stock) of goods. These costs are treated as an expense in the period the business recognizes income from sale of the goods.

Determining costs requires keeping records of goods or materials purchased and any discounts on such purchase. In addition, if the goods are modified, the business must determine the costs incurred in modifying the goods. Such modification costs include labor, supplies or additional material, supervision, quality control, and use of equipment. Principles for determining costs may be easily stated, but application in practice is often difficult due to a variety of considerations in the allocation of costs.

Cost of goods sold may also reflect adjustments. Among the potential adjustments are decline in value of the goods (i.e., lower market value than cost), obsolescence, damage, etc.

When multiple goods are bought or made, it may be necessary to identify which costs relate to which particular goods sold. This may be done using an identification convention, such as specific identification of the goods, first-in-first-out (FIFO), or average cost. Alternative systems may be used in some countries, such as last-in-first-out (LIFO), gross profit method, retail method, or a combinations of these.

Cost of goods sold may be the same or different for accounting and tax purposes, depending on the rules of the particular jurisdiction. Certain expenses are included in COGS. Expenses that are included in COGS cannot be deducted again as a business expense. COGS expenses include: 
* The cost of products or raw materials, including freight or shipping charges;
* The direct labor costs of workers who produce the products;
* The cost of storing products the business sells;
* Factory overhead expenses.

==Importance of inventories==
Inventories have a significant effect on profits. A business that produces or buys goods to sell must keep track of inventories of goods under all accounting and income tax rules. An example illustrates why. Fred buys auto parts and resells them. In 2008, Fred buys $100 worth of parts. He sells parts for $80 that he bought for $30, and has $70 worth of parts left. In 2009, he sells the remainder of the parts for $180. If he keeps track of inventory, his profit in 2008 is $50, and his profit in 2009 is $110, or $160 in total. If he deducted all the costs in 2008, he would have a loss of $20 in 2008 and a profit of $180 in 2009. The total is the same, but the timing is much different. Most countries&#x27; accounting and income tax rules (if the country has an income tax) require the use of inventories for all businesses that regularly sell goods they have made or bought.

==Cost of goods for resale==
Cost of goods purchased for resale includes purchase price as well as all other costs of acquisitions, excluding any discounts.

Additional costs may include freight paid to acquire the goods, customs duties, sales or use taxes not recoverable paid on materials used, and fees paid for acquisition. For financial reporting purposes such period costs as purchasing department, warehouse, and other operating expenses are usually not treated as part of inventory or cost of goods sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, some of these period costs must be capitalized as part of inventory. Costs of selling, packing, and shipping goods to customers are treated as operating expenses related to the sale. Both International and U.S. accounting standards require that certain abnormal costs, such as those associated with idle capacity, must be treated as expenses rather than part of inventory.

Discounts that must be deducted from the costs of purchased inventory are the following:

* Trade discounts (reduction in the price of goods that a manufacturer or wholesaler provides to a retailer) – includes a discount that is always allowed, regardless of the time of payment.
* Manufacturer&#x27;s rebates – based on the dealer&#x27;s purchases during the year.
* Cash discounts (a reduction in the invoice price that the seller provides if the dealer pays immediately or within a specified time) – may reduce COGS, or may be treated separately as gross income.

Value added tax is generally not treated as part of cost of goods sold if it may be used as an input credit or is otherwise recoverable from the taxing authority.

==Cost of goods made by the business==
The cost of goods produced in the business should include all costs of production. The key components of cost generally include:
*Parts, raw materials and supplies used,
*Labor, including associated costs such as payroll taxes and benefits, and
*Overhead of the business allocated to production.

Most businesses make more than one of a particular item. Thus, costs are incurred for multiple items rather than a particular item sold. Determining how much of each of these components to allocate to particular goods requires either tracking the particular costs or making some allocations of costs. Parts and raw materials are often tracked to particular sets (&quot;e.g.&quot;, batches or production runs) of goods, then allocated to each item.

Labor costs include direct labor and indirect labor. Direct labor costs are the wages paid to those employees who spend all their time working directly on the product being manufactured. Indirect labor costs are the wages paid to other factory employees involved in production. Costs of payroll taxes and fringe benefits are generally included in labor costs, but may be treated as overhead costs. Labor costs may be allocated to an item or set of items based on timekeeping records.

Costs of materials include direct raw materials, as well as supplies and indirect materials. Where non-incidental amounts of supplies are maintained, the taxpayer must keep inventories of the supplies for income tax purposes, charging them to expense or cost of goods sold as used rather than as purchased.

Materials and labor may be allocated based on past experience, or standard costs. Where materials or labor costs for a period fall short of or exceed the expected amount of standard costs, a &quot;variance&quot; is recorded. Such variances are then allocated among cost of goods sold and remaining inventory at the end of the period.

Determining overhead costs often involves making assumptions about what costs should be associated with production activities and what costs should be associated with other activities. Traditional cost accounting methods attempt to make these assumptions based on past experience and management judgment as to factual relationships. Activity based costing attempts to allocate costs based on those factors that drive the business to incur the costs.

Overhead costs are often allocated to sets of produced goods based on the ratio of labor hours or costs or the ratio of materials used for producing the set of goods. Overhead costs may be referred to as factory overhead or factory burden for those costs incurred at the plant level or &quot;overall burden&quot; for those costs incurred at the organization level. Where labor hours are used, a &quot;burden rate&quot; or overhead cost per hour of labor may be added along with labor costs. Other methods may be used to associate overhead costs with particular goods produced. Overhead rates may be standard rates, in which case there may be variances, or may be adjusted for each set of goods produced.

==Identification conventions==
In some cases, the cost of goods sold may be identified with the item sold. Ordinarily, however, the identity of goods is lost between the time of purchase or manufacture and the time of sale. Determining which goods have been sold, and the cost of those goods, requires either identifying the goods or using a convention to assume which goods were sold. This may be referred to as a cost flow assumption or inventory identification assumption or convention. The following methods are available in many jurisdictions for associating costs with goods sold and goods still on hand:
*Specific identification. Under this method, particular items are identified, and costs are tracked with respect to each item. This may require considerable recordkeeping. This method cannot be used where the goods or items are indistinguishable or fungible.
*Average cost. The average cost method relies on average unit cost to calculate cost of units sold and ending inventory. Several variations on the calculation may be used, including weighted average and moving average.
*First-In First-Out (FIFO) assumes that the items purchased or produced first are sold first. Costs of inventory per unit or item are determined at the time produces or purchased. The oldest cost (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the first in) is then matched against revenue and assigned to cost of goods sold.
*Last-In First-Out (LIFO) is the reverse of FIFO. Some systems permit determining the costs of goods at the time acquired or made, but assigning costs to goods sold under the assumption that the goods made or acquired last are sold first. Costs of specific goods acquired or made are added to a pool of costs for the type of goods. Under this system, the business may maintain costs under FIFO but track an offset in the form of a LIFO reserve. Such reserve (an asset or contra-asset) represents the difference in cost of inventory under the FIFO and LIFO assumptions. Such amount may be different for financial reporting and tax purposes in the United States.
*Dollar Value LIFO. Under this variation of LIFO, increases or decreases in the LIFO reserve are determined based on dollar values rather than quantities.
*Retail inventory method. Resellers of goods may use this method to simplify record keeping. The calculated cost of goods on hand at the end of a period is the ratio of cost of goods acquired to the retail value of the goods times the retail value of goods on hand. Cost of goods acquired includes beginning inventory as previously valued plus purchases. Cost of goods sold is then beginning inventory plus purchases less the calculated cost of goods on hand at the end of the period.

==Example==
Jane owns a business that resells machines. At the start of 2009, she has no machines or parts on hand. She buys machines A and B for 10 each, and later buys machines C and D for 12 each. All the machines are the same, but they have serial numbers. Jane sells machines A and C for 20 each. Her cost of goods sold depends on her inventory method. Under specific identification, the cost of goods sold is 10 + 12, the particular costs of machines A and C. If she uses FIFO, her costs are 20 (10+10). If she uses average cost, her costs are 22 ( (10+10+12+12)/4 x 2). If she uses LIFO, her costs are 24 (12+12). Thus, her profit for accounting and tax purposes may be 20, 18, or 16, depending on her inventory method. After the sales, her inventory values are either 20, 22 or 24.

After year end, Jane decides she can make more money by improving machines B and D. She buys and uses 10 of parts and supplies, and it takes 6 hours at 2 per hour to make the improvements to each machine. Jane has overhead, including rent and electricity. She calculates that the overhead adds 0.5 per hour to her costs. Thus, Jane has spent 20 to improve each machine (10/2 + 12 + (6 x 0.5) ). She sells machine D for 45. Her cost for that machine depends on her inventory method. If she used FIFO, the cost of machine D is 12 plus 20 she spent improving it, for a profit of 13. Remember, she used up the two 10 cost items already under FIFO. If she uses average cost, it is 11 plus 20, for a profit of 14. If she used LIFO, the cost would be 10 plus 20 for a profit of 15.

In year 3, Jane sells the last machine for 38 and quits the business. She recovers the last of her costs. Her total profits for the three years are the same under all inventory methods. Only the timing of income and the balance of inventory differ. Here is a comparison under FIFO, Average Cost, and LIFO:

==Write-downs and allowances==
The value of goods held for sale by a business may decline due to a number of factors. The goods may prove to be defective or below normal quality standards (subnormal). The goods may become obsolete. The market value of the goods may simply decline due to economic factors.

Where the market value of goods has declined for whatever reasons, the business may choose to value its inventory at the lower of cost or market value, also known as &quot;net realizable value&quot;. This may be recorded by accruing an expense (&quot;i.e.&quot;, creating an inventory reserve) for declines due to obsolescence, etc. Current period net income as well as net inventory value at the end of the period is reduced for the decline in value.

Any property held by a business may decline in value or be damaged by unusual events, such as a fire. The loss of value where the goods are destroyed is accounted for as a loss, and the inventory is fully written off. Generally, such loss is recognized for both financial reporting and tax purposes. However, book and tax amounts may differ under some systems.

==Alternative views==
Alternatives to traditional cost accounting have been proposed by various management theorists. These include:
*Throughput accounting, under the Theory of Constraints, under which only totally variable costs are included in cost of goods sold and inventory is treated as investment.
*Lean accounting, in which most traditional costing methods are ignored in favor of measuring weekly &quot;value streams&quot;.
*Resource consumption accounting, which discards most current accounting concepts in favor of proportional costing based on simulations.

None of these views conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Accounting Standards, nor are any accepted for most income or other tax reporting purposes.

<text>Erythrocebus is a genus of Old World monkey. All three species in this genus are found in Africa, and are known as patas monkeys. While previously considered a monotypic genus containing just &quot;E. patas&quot;, a 2017 review argued that, based on morphological evidence and heavy geographic separation between taxa, &quot;E. patas&quot; should be split back into distinct species as recognised in the 19th century.

There are three species recognized.

<text>The common patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), also known as the hussar monkey, is a ground-dwelling monkey distributed over semi-arid areas of West Africa, and into East Africa.

== Taxonomy ==
There is some confusion surrounding if there are valid subspecies, with some listing four, others three, and others listing two: the western &quot;Erythrocebus patas patas&quot; (with a black nose) and the eastern &quot;E. patas pyrrhonotus&quot; (with a white nose). However, it was later discovered that the nose colour used to separate these subspecies could change to white during pregnancy in females, as well as in general as animals aged, and &quot;E. patas pyrrhonotus&quot; in Kenya often did not have white noses, thus &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; has classified &quot;E. patas&quot; as a monotypic species.

The genus status of the species has previously been in flux. Colin Groves first argued the species was closely related to &quot;Cercopithecus aethiops&quot; in 1989, based on anatomical morphology. Phylogenetic evidence from 2003 appeared to validate him, finding the patas monkey to form a clade within the vervet genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot; together with &quot;C. aethiops&quot; and &quot;C. lhoesti&quot;, and based on this study &quot;Erythrocebus&quot; was proposed to be sunk into synonymy with &quot;Cercopithecus&quot;. However, more recent studies have found this interpretation of &quot;Cercopithecus&quot; to be paraphyletic, and thus many species in &quot;Cercopithecus&quot; have since been reclassified to numerous new genera and species, with &quot;C. aethiops&quot; moved to &quot;Chlorocebus&quot; and &quot;C. lhoesti&quot; to &quot;Allochrocebus&quot;. &quot;Erythrocebus&quot; is thus now thought to be a distinct genus.

&quot;Erythrocebus&quot; was previously thought to be a monotypic genus containing only &quot;E. patas&quot;. However, a 2017 study proposed splitting &quot;E. patas&quot; into three species (&quot;E. patas sensu stricto&quot;, &quot;E. poliphaeus&quot;, and &quot;E. baumstarki&quot;) based on morphological differences and heavy geographic separation between taxa, with the IUCN Red List and American Society of Mammalogists following through with this.

== Description ==
The male common patas monkey grows to to in length, excluding the tail, which measures . Adult males are considerably larger than adult females, which average in length. 
Adult males average and adult females , showing a high degree of sexual dimorphism.
Males have the longest canine teeth of all the African long-tailed monkeys and the size of their canines plays a role in establishing a pecking order among males. Reaching speeds of , it is the fastest runner among the primates. The life span in the wild can be up to about 20 years.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It is found in many parts of central, western, and eastern Africa. It also has been introduced to Puerto Rico. The species avoids dense woodlands and lives in more open tropical savanna.

== Behavior ==
The common patas monkey lives in multi-female groups of up to 60 individuals (although much larger aggregations have been reported). The group contains just one adult male for most of the year. During the breeding season, there are multi-male influxes into the group. Once juvenile males reach sexual maturity (around the age of four years) they leave the group, usually joining all-male groups. The adult females in the group initiate movement of the group with the male following their lead.

The common patas monkey feeds on insects, gum, seeds, and tubers, a diet more characteristic of much smaller primates.

=== Female social organization ===
Variation in the female social structure of patas monkeys has been observed across different populations. This variation may be dependent on food resources, as conflict between individuals is often a result of competition for limited resources. Higher rates of conflict over dense, but limited, food, such as fruit bushes, is associated with more stable, well defined dominance hierarchies than habitats with more diffuse resources, such as insects. Variation in the availability of these resources has been associated with variation in dominance hierarchies among females.

Conflict among females has also shown the presence of recognition among matrilineal relatives. It has been observed that, shortly after conflicts among two females, patas monkeys often act differently toward each other than if they had not been in conflict. Females often reconcile with each other by activities such as sitting together and grooming. While this reconciliatory behavior is observed even between unrelated individuals, it is most common among matrilineal relatives. Dominance structure has relatively little effect on the probability of reconciliation occurring, except that the alpha-female is the least reconciliatory of the females. Affiliation toward matrilineal relatives is common in other primates as well, such as vervet monkeys.

=== Male social organization ===
Mating in common patas monkeys is seasonal and occurs during the wet season. During periods when females are not receptive, relatively stable groups with one adult resident male and several females are the norm. This leaves an excess of males that either form all male groups or live on their own. During the mating season, resident males may be chased away by invading solitary males. This usually results in the formation of multi-male, multi-female groups shortly thereafter, as more males invade a group. The new resident male does not chase away subordinate invading males, but rather focuses on mating with females. At the end of the mating season, one-male, multi-female groups stabilize. One male remains as the resident male and chases other males away. In some instances, submissive males are tolerated by the resident male for short periods of time; however, they rarely remain in the group for more than several days.

Young males have been observed to leave their natal groups anywhere from two to four years of age. However, one study showed that most juveniles left before they were three, which is before most males reach sexual maturity. This contrasts with an earlier study in which juveniles were observed to leave later, at sexual maturity, indicating that there may be variation between groups. The reason young males leave their natal group is also contested. Dominant males have been observed to act aggressively toward younger males in captivity. However, observations of wild patas monkeys has shown young males leaving the group in which they were born without any aggressive behavior from the adult male. The juveniles, in the time shortly before they leave, spend increasingly less and less time with the adult females in the group. However, juvenile males do not change the amount of time they spend near the adult male. This may indicate weakening of matrilineal ties, rather than male aggression, as the main reason juveniles disperse from their natal group.

=== Alarm calls ===
Common patas monkeys have several distinct alarm calls that warn members in the group of predators. Different alarm calls are given by different group members (i.e. adult females, adult males, juveniles, etc.) and certain alarm calls are distinctive of different types of predators. Unlike other primates, patas monkeys rarely take refuge from predators in trees. This is most likely due to the relatively sparse tree cover in patas monkey habitats. While patas monkeys usually run on the ground away from predators, individuals have been observed to attack predators such as jackals and wildcats. This behavior has been observed in both males and females.

==In popular culture== 
The relationship between the patas monkey and the whistling thorn acacia may have inspired &quot;The Lorax&quot; by Dr. Seuss.

<text>Long-term liabilities, or non-current liabilities, are liabilities that are due beyond a year or the normal operation period of the company. The normal operation period is the amount of time it takes for a company to turn inventory into cash. On a classified balance sheet, liabilities are separated between current and long-term liabilities to help users assess the company&#x27;s financial standing in short-term and long-term periods. Long-term liabilities give users more information about the long-term prosperity of the company, while current liabilities inform the user of debt that the company owes in the current period. On a balance sheet, accounts are listed in order of liquidity, so long-term liabilities come after current liabilities. In addition, the specific long-term liability accounts are listed on the balance sheet in order of liquidity. Therefore, an account due within eighteen months would be listed before an account due within twenty-four months.
==Examples==
Examples of long-term liabilities are bonds payable, long-term loans, capital leases, pension liabilities, post-retirement healthcare liabilities, deferred compensation, deferred revenues, deferred income taxes, and derivative liabilities.

== Exceptions ==

If a liability is currently due in fewer than twelve months and is in the process of being refinanced so that it is due after a year, then a company can record this debt in long-term investments. Additionally, if a liability is to be covered by a long-term investment, it can be recorded as a long-term liability even if it is due in the current period. Still, the long-term investment must be sufficient to cover the debt.

<text>Petty cash is a small amount of discretionary funds in the form of cash used for minor expenditures.

The most common way of accounting for petty cash expenditures is to use the imprest system. 

==Audit controls==
Oversight of petty cash is important because of the potential for abuse. Examples of petty cash controls include a limit on disbursements and monthly audits by someone other than the custodian. Use of petty cash is sufficiently widespread that vouchers for use in reimbursement are available at any office supply store.

The petty cash daybook is one of the daybooks used in bookkeeping and the double-entry bookkeeping system.

<doc id="265343" wikidata="Q7324577" url="?curid=265343" title="Richard C. Weaver">
<text>Richard C. Weaver is a Californian man known by the nickname Handshake Man. Weaver has earned notoriety for frequently bypassing the US Secret Service and shaking the hand of the United States President.

Weaver claims his handshakes are often used as a way of passing &quot;notes from God&quot; to the presidents.

According to his site, Weaver is a born-again Christian who is married to Donna Weaver and has two children, Cindy and David. He also believes that God has directly spoken to him and calls himself a &quot;modern-day prophet&quot;. In late 2008, Weaver stated that he would not attempt to shake Barack Obama&#x27;s hand due to an ongoing ban from Washington D.C. that had yet to expire.

==Pre 2001==

Richard C. Weaver claims to have shaken the hand of four US Presidents after Jimmy Carter. However, with little evidence of such events, it is unknown if these instances actually occurred. The only confirmed event was the 1997 inauguration of Bill Clinton where Weaver managed to shake Clinton&#x27;s hand. Despite the incident having led the Secret Service to prepare for his return, Weaver was able to bypass security and meet the then recently inaugurated George W. Bush in 2001. (Weaver&#x27;s website displays a picture of him meeting President George H. W. Bush.)

==2001 Presidential Inauguration==

On the January 20 inauguration event of 2001, Weaver was able to meet George W. Bush and hand him a coin after he had been sworn in as President. Weaver had a standing-room-only ticket that would only allow him access to the event. Despite having been shown tapes of a similar meeting between Weaver and former president Bill Clinton, the Secret Service were not able to catch him.

Although Ari Fleischer insisted that the president was in no danger, U.S. Capitol Police took the matter seriously as a breach of security.

==Post 2001==

On February 6, 2003 Weaver attended the National Prayer Breakfast meeting and was able to hand Bush an eight-page typed letter about Iraq &quot;from God&quot;. At George W. Bush&#x27;s second inauguration in 2005, Weaver was arrested on an outstanding warrant related to his prior presidential photo stunts.

On December 8, 2009, CNN&#x27;s website discussed an unreleased Secret Service document used for training purposes which discusses various instances where individuals have bypassed the Secret Service and gained access to the president. This document credits Mr. Weaver with four instances of having gained access to a president.

<doc id="265354" wikidata="Q231525" url="?curid=265354" title="Olave Baden-Powell">
<text>Olave St Clair Baden-Powell, Baroness Baden-Powell (&quot;née&quot; Soames; 22 February 1889 – 25 June 1977) was the first Chief Guide for Britain and the wife of Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell (the founder of Scouting and co-founder of Girl Guides). She outlived her husband, who was 32 years her senior, by over 35 years.

Lady Baden-Powell became Chief Guide for Britain in 1918. Later the same year, at the Swanwick conference for Commissioners in October, she was presented with a gold Silver Fish, one of only two ever made. She was elected World Chief Guide in 1930. As well as making a major contribution to the development of the Guide/Girl Scout movements, she visited 111 countries during her life, attending Jamborees and national Guide and Scout associations. In 1932, she was created a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire by King George V.

==Family and early life==
Born in Chesterfield, England, Olave Soames was the third child and youngest daughter of a brewery owner and artist Harold Soames (1855–1918), of Gray Rigg, Lilliput, Dorset (descended from the landed gentry Soames family of Sheffield Park) and his wife Katherine Mary, daughter of George Hill. She was educated by her parents and by several governesses at home. She lived in seventeen homes in the first 23 years of her life. Olave became keen on outdoor sports including tennis, swimming, football, skating and canoeing, and also played the violin.

Olave was the sister of Arthur Granville Soames and thus aunt to his children, including Christopher Soames, Conservative politician and diplomat, who in 1947 wed Mary Churchill, the youngest child of Sir Winston Churchill.

==Adult life==

===Marriage and children===

In January 1912, Olave met Second Boer War hero and founder of the Scouts, Robert Baden-Powell, on an ocean liner (RMSP &quot;Arcadian&quot;) on the way via the Caribbean to New York to start a lecture tour. She was 23, he was 55, and they shared the same birthday. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation. They married on 30 October 1912 in a very private ceremony, in St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Parkstone, her parish church. She was given away by her father. Apart from clergy, the only other people present were his brother and sister and Robert Kekewich, a close friend of his, her mother and brother, her brother-in-law and Miss Sie Bower, a close friend of hers.

The Scouts and Guides of England each donated a penny to buy the Baden-Powells a wedding gift of a car (not the Rolls-Royce called &quot;Jam-Roll&quot; that was presented to them in 1929). Olave&#x27;s father helped financially with the purchase of Pax Hill near Bentley, Hampshire, as a family home where she lived with her husband from 29 January 1919 until 25 October 1938.

The Baden-Powells had three children – a son and two daughters (who took the courtesy titles of Honourable in 1929; the son later succeeding his father as the 2nd Lord Baden-Powell upon his father&#x27;s death in 1941):
* Arthur Robert Peter Baden-Powell, later 2nd Baron Baden-Powell (1913–1962), married Carine Boardman (1913–1993), and they had two sons and a daughter; at Peter&#x27;s death, the elder son Robert succeeded him as 3rd Baron Baden-Powell; the younger son, Michael, and the daughter live in Australia;
* The Hon. Heather Grace Baden-Powell (1915–1986), married John Hall King (1913–2004), and they had two sons; and
* The Hon. Betty St. Clair Baden-Powell, CBE (1917–2004) like her mother, met her future husband on board ship, an older man (by a decade) who shared her birthday. She married, on 24 September 1936, Gervas Charles Robert Clay (1907–2009). They had a daughter and three sons. Betty Clay was also prominent in the Guide Movement in Northern Rhodesia until they retired to England in 1964 when she became involved with the Girl Guides in England until her death.

In addition, when Olave&#x27;s sister, Auriol Davidson, née Soames, died in 1919, Olave took her three nieces, Christian (1912–1975), Clare (1913–1980), and Yvonne, (1918–2000), into her family and brought them up as her children.

===War work===
During 1915 and 1916, with World War I in progress, Olave assisted directly with the war effort in France. Robert had seen the usefulness of the YMCA&#x27;s recreational huts for the soldiers and persuaded the Mercers&#x27; Company (of which he had been Master in 1912) to pay for such a hut at Val-de-Lievres, Calais. It was to be staffed by adults connected with Scouting. Olave was one of the team of five men and three women who staffed the hut at the start. She persuaded her mother to look after the children for the time she would be away.

Olave left for France on 7 October 1915, when her second child was five months old. Her regular work in the Mercers&#x27; hut included serving cocoa and cigarettes and chatting with those who came in. She also recalled in her autobiography playing her violin and singing at the Christmas Concert. Olave also adopted several stray animals during her time in Val-de-Lievres.

During this time, Robert had organised the Scouts to sponsor another recreational hut. Olave and two others started this hut at Étaples after Christmas 1915. At the end of January, Olave was ordered home due to sickness, ending her three months in France.

===Growing involvement in Scouting===

Olave and Robert moved into Ewhurst Place, outside Robertsbridge in Sussex in April 1913. In June of that year, the 1st Ewhurst Scout Troop was inaugurated. Olave was the warranted Scoutmaster of this troop, assisted by the family&#x27;s housemaid and the gardener. Olave accompanied Robert on many of his Scouting tours and to events. She also typed letters for him. In 1915, the Baden-Powells bought a small car, and after Robert taught her to drive, Olave often drove him to engagements.

Although most famously connected with the Girl Guides, Olave&#x27;s first offer to help them in 1914 was turned down. The Girl Guide movement had started after pressure from girls who wanted to become Scouts. It was set up by Robert Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell. After the reorganisation of the Girl Guides in 1915, Olave again offered to help, this time successfully, and she started organising Guiding in Sussex. She became the County Commissioner for Sussex in March 1916. In October 1916, the first conference for County Commissioners was held and it was here that the Commissioners unanimously requested that Olave take the role of Chief Commissioner – she was just pregnant with her third child. Shortly before this, she had organised a great number of women in other parts of Britain to take up roles in Guiding. In 1918, Olave was acclaimed Chief Guide, a title she much preferred to Chief Commissioner.

===Recognition===
====Awards====
====Standard====
Olave Baden-Powell was presented with a personal standard by the UK Girl Guide&#x27;s County Commissioners. It was designed by Mrs Zigomala. Kay-Shuttleworth supervised the making of the standard.

The Standard of Lady Baden-Powell, Chief Guide of the World, is blue (azure) from the hoist to the fly. Nearest the hoist is the gold (or) trefoil; then come two small hemispheres, showing a coloured map of the world, indicating her post as Chief Guide. These are placed high to the left of the main fly, which is divided throughout its length by two silver (argent) waves, amongst which are shown three ships with black hulls and white sails, four dolphins and the Gold Fish of the Chief Guide. Then between two red (gules) motto bands on which are embroidered the Baden-Powell and Girl Guide mottoes in gold letters, there is a section alluding to the outdoor life, showing white tents on a green (vert) field. In the extreme fly the Baden-Powell crests are embroidered.

===Death of Robert Baden-Powell===
In October 1938, Olave moved to the Outspan Hotel, Nyeri, Kenya, near her third cousin, Jack Soames, and the notorious Happy Valley set, with her husband, where he died, on 8 January 1941. Lord Erroll was in the funeral procession, just before his murder on 24 January 1941.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Olave received thousands of letters of condolence. She was helped to reply to them all by Bertha Hines, the wife of David Hines, who was away fighting the Italian army that had invaded Ethiopia and Somalia. Often, Olave would watch Bertha&#x27;s baby daughter, Penny, while Bertha typed reply letters.

===World War II===
In 1942, she braved U-boat attacks to return to the UK and, as she had no home to return to, was allocated a grace and favour apartment in Hampton Court Palace, in which she lived from 1943 to 1976. Her own home, Pax Hill, had been commandeered and taken over by the Canadian military. Through World War II she toured the United Kingdom. She was on a visit when a V2 missile damaged her Hampton Court apartment in 1944. As soon as she could after D-Day, she went to France and toured throughout Europe as the war ended to help revive Guiding and Scouting.

===After World War II===

Olave led the Guide Movement worldwide for forty years, travelling all over the globe helping to establish and encourage the Guide Movement in other countries, and bringing membership to over six and a half million worldwide. Olave was present in Washington, DC in 1962 for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Girl Scouts.

Having suffered a heart attack in Australia in 1961, she was finally banned from travelling by her doctor at the age of 80 in 1970 when she was diagnosed with diabetes from which she eventually died.

In 1968, the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) gave Olave a credit card to defray her travel costs. When she stopped travelling, the BSA asked her to use the card for &#x27;keeping in touch&#x27;. This included paying for over 2000 Christmas cards she sent to those personally known to her.

Having spent her later years in a grace-and-favour apartment at Hampton Court Palace, Olave died on 25 June 1977 at Birtley House, Bramley in Surrey. Her ashes were taken to Kenya to be buried in the same grave as her husband&#x27;s remains. She was survived by her two daughters, her son having predeceased her.

==Legacy==

The Olave Centre for Guides was built in north London in Olave&#x27;s memory. This has the World Bureau and Pax Lodge on its grounds. Pax Lodge is one of WAGGGS&#x27; five World Centres.

Scouts and Guides mark 22 February as B.-P. Day or World Thinking Day, the joint birthdays of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World. On that day in 2011, a Blue Plaque was unveiled near the site of the house in Chesterfield where she lived, by Derbyshire County Council. The plaque installation followed an online poll in which she received 18,026 votes out of 25,080 (72%); this compares to 1,231 (5%) for next most popular nominee, George Stephenson.

The Olave Baden-Powell Bursary Fund was set up in 1979 from voluntary contributions in memory of Olave B-P. Annually awarded bursaries aim to allow girls in Girlguiding UK to further their interests and hobbies and realise their dreams.

As a child, Olave learned the violin; her first violin she called Diana. It was a copy of a Stradivarius made by Messrs. Hill for the Paris Exhibition and many years later it was presented to the Guide Association. It is still available on loan to Guides who are seriously learning to play the violin before they acquire their instrument.

A movement was started in Australia, the idea being, &quot;When you buy an ice-cream, buy one also for the Chief Guide&quot;, and this &quot;Ice-cream Fund&quot; raises a significant sum every year, sent to Olave B-P to give away to various Guiding causes; one such was to provide doors for new Guide buildings.

<doc id="265355" wikidata="Q118483" url="?curid=265355" title="Carter Center">
<text>The Carter Center is a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization founded in 1982 by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter. He and his wife Rosalynn Carter partnered with Emory University after his defeat in the 1980 United States presidential election. The center is located in a shared building adjacent to the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum on of parkland, on the site of the razed neighborhood of Copenhill, two miles (3km) from downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The library and museum are owned and operated by the United States National Archives and Records Administration, while the center is governed by a Board of Trustees, consisting of business leaders, educators, former government officials, and philanthropists.

The Carter Center&#x27;s goal is to advance human rights and alleviate human suffering. The center has projects across 80 countries including election monitoring, democratic institution-building, conflict mediation, and human rights advocacy. It also leads efforts to treat neglected tropical diseases, spearheading the campaign to eradicate dracunculiasis, as well as treating onchocerciasis, trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and malaria.

In 2002, Jimmy Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work &quot;to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development&quot; through the Carter Center. In 2007, he wrote an autobiography entitled &quot;Beyond the White House: Waging Peace, Fighting Disease, Building Hope&quot;, which chronicles the first 25 years of The Carter Center.

== History ==
The center was founded in 1982 and dedicated in 1986 with William Foege as its executive director.

In 1993, John Hardman was appointed executive director, and during the 1990s the center received several multimillion-dollar donations to fight Guinea worm disease and to prevent blindness.

In 1994, the center launched an initiative called &quot;Not Even One&quot; to fight child death by firearm. They decided to expand the program on March 25, 1997, effective April 1 of the same year.

On October 2, 1995, The Rosalynn Carter Georgia Mental Health Forum was held at The Carter Center.

== Governance ==
The center is governed by a board of trustees, which oversees the organization&#x27;s assets and property and promotes its objectives and goals. In November 2015, Jason Carter, grandson of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter, became Chair of the board of trustees.

A community advisory group – the Board of Councilors – includes public and private-sector leaders who support The Carter Center and its activities in their communities and organizations. Members attend quarterly presentations on the center&#x27;s work.

The CEO of The Carter Center is Paige Alexander, appointed on June 16, 2020. Her predecessor was (Ret.) Ambassador Mary Ann Peters who served in the position since 2014.

Center-based councils of eminent persons who offer guidance to or participate in center activities include: the Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas, the International Task Force for Disease Eradication, and the Mental Health Task Force. The Carter Center also collaborates with other public and private organizations.

== Peace programs ==
=== Observing elections ===
The Carter Center performs election monitoring, sending teams of observers to determine the legitimacy of 115 elections in 40 countries since 1989. Scholars of election monitoring consider the Carter Center to be a &quot;high-quality&quot; election monitor. The Carter Center played an important role in the &quot;Declaration of Principles for International Election Observers&quot;, which codifies rules of best practices for election monitors.

Carter Center observers analyze election laws, assess voter education and registration processes, and evaluate fairness in campaigns. The presence of impartial election observers deters interference or fraud in the voting process, and reassures voters that they can safely and secretly cast their ballots and that vote tabulation will be conducted without tampering.

Teams typically include 30–100 highly qualified impartial observers – regional leaders, political scientists, regional specialists, and election observation professionals.

The Carter Center sends observers only when invited by a country&#x27;s electoral authorities and welcomed by the major political parties. Observers do not interfere in the electoral process and do not represent the U.S. government.

The center&#x27;s endorsement of the electoral process in the 2004 Venezuelan recall referendum has been disputed by the Center for Security Policy. Fox News&#x27; Doug Schoen told Michael Barone of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;Our internal sourcing tells us that there was fraud in the Venezuelan central commission. The Carter Center looked into the allegations and released a paper and statistical analysis reaffirming their original conclusions.

The center played a key role – with the U.N. Electoral Assistance Division and the National Democratic Institute – in building consensus on a common set of international principles for election observation. It is also leading the effort to develop effective methodologies for observing elections that employ new electronic voting technologies.

In the 2020 US election, the Carter Center observed parts of the process at home for the first time in the history of the United States. In this context, the center conducted information campaigns in advance to strengthen confidence in the election process. On November 13, 2020, the center announced that it would monitor the hand recount in Georgia to &quot;help bolster transparency and confidence in election results.

=== Strengthening democracy beyond elections ===
The Carter Center supports the growth of democratic institutions to ensure that there is a respect for rule of law and human rights, that government decisions are open and transparent, and that everyone can have adequate resources to compete fairly for public office.

For example, the center is supporting the efforts of civic leaders in Ethiopia to convene discussions about the most pressing and contentious political and social issues facing the country, and in the Palestinian Territories, it maintains a small presence in Ramallah focused on the ongoing monitoring and analysis of critical issues of democratic development.

Democratic initiatives in Latin America include support for regional access-to-information programs, creation of an inter-American support network, and reform of political campaign financing. The center-based Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas plays an important role in accomplishing these objectives.

The Carter Center also promotes the dissemination to emerging democracies and regional organizations of models, lessons, and best practices for democratic governance. The goal is to empower those in transitioning countries who are trying to build stronger democratic institutions and practices.

=== Advancing human rights ===
The Carter Center believes all people are entitled to basic human rights. These rights include political rights, such as peace, freedom, and self-governance, as well as the social rights of health care, food, shelter, and economic opportunity.

The center actively supports human rights defenders around the world. In partnership with Human Rights First and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Center holds an annual human rights defenders policy forum hosted by President Carter in Atlanta.

President and Mrs. Carter have intervened with heads of state on behalf of human rights defenders and victims for more than 20 years. They often take their human rights concerns to heads of state in personal meetings and through letters.

The center and President Carter are strong supporters of the U.N. Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court. Both oppose the death penalty and urge its abolition in the U.S.

=== Mediating conflict ===
Recalling President Carter&#x27;s success in the White House negotiating the long-lasting peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, groups in conflict turn to The Carter Center to help them prevent and resolve conflict. Lacking any official authority, the center has become a trusted broker for peace, serving as a channel for dialogue and negotiation.

Recent examples include:
* President Carter&#x27;s mission to North Korea in 1994, which paved the way for a U.S.-North Korea pact on nuclear issues.
* Assisting unofficial Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in designing a model agreement for peace – called the Geneva Accord – in 2002 and 2003.
* Negotiation of the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and Uganda
* President Carter&#x27;s mission to Haiti in 1994 with Senator Sam Nunn and the then former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell to avert a U.S.-led multinational invasion and restore to power Haiti&#x27;s democratically elected president.
* President Carter&#x27;s historic trip to Cuba in 2002 to seek improved U.S.-Cuban relations
* Negotiation of a cease-fire in 1995 in Sudan to allow humanitarian groups treat Guinea worm disease and river blindness and immunize children.
* Holding summits in Egypt and Tunisia in 1995 and 1996 to address violence in the Great Lakes region of Africa
* An agreement on the restoration of low-level diplomatic relations between Colombia and Ecuador under a deal brokered by the former president, as announced by the Carter Center on June 8, 2008.

=== Assisting China village elections ===
Since 1988, the Chinese government has authorized direct village elections to help maintain social and political order in the context of rapid economic reforms. At the invitation of China&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Carter Center initiated a joint project in 1998 to standardize Chinese village election procedures and assist in training of election officials and elected National People&#x27;s Congress deputies. In 2011, the Carter Center decided to focus on advancing the US- China relationship, and since 2015 has been promoting greater Africa-U.S.-China cooperation.

== Health programs ==
The center has prevented the suffering of millions of people around the world from illnesses often ignored by others. Health programs seek to provide people with the information and access to services they need to treat their illnesses and take steps to prevent future spread of disease. An emphasis is placed on building partnerships for change among international agencies, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations and on working with ministries of health to strengthen or establish permanent health care delivery systems in the poorest nations.

During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, Carter commented on what he felt is the greatest challenge the world faces:

&quot;Among all the possible choices, I decided that the most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and poorest people on earth. Citizens of the ten wealthiest countries are now 75 times richer than those who live in the ten poorest ones, and the separation is increasing every year, not only between nations but also within them. The results of this disparity are root causes of most of the world&#x27;s unresolved problems, including starvation, illiteracy, environmental degradation, violent conflict and unnecessary illnesses that range from Guinea worm to HIV/AIDS. Tragically, in the industrialized world there is a terrible absence of understanding or concern about those who are enduring lives of despair and hopelessness. We have not yet made the commitment to share with others an appreciable part of our excessive wealth. This is a necessary and potentially rewarding burden that we should all be willing to assume.&quot;

=== Disease eradication efforts ===
The Carter Center began spearheading the campaign to eradicate Guinea worm disease worldwide in 1986. At the time, there were about 3.5 million annual cases of the disease in 20 countries in Africa and Asia. In 2023, there were 14 reported cases of Guinea worm disease, which remained endemic in five countries: Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. Guinea worm disease is poised to be the first parasitic disease to be eradicated and the only disease to be eradicated without the use of vaccines or drugs.

Within affected countries, the center reinforces existing disease eradication programs by providing technical and financial assistance, as well as logistics and tools, such as donated filter cloth material, larvicide, and medical kits.

The International Task Force for Disease Eradication has been based at The Carter Center since its formation in 1988. The group has reviewed more than 100 infectious diseases and identified six as potentially eradicable – dracunculiasis, poliomyelitis, mumps, rubella, lymphatic filariasis, and cysticercosis.

=== Implementing disease control and treatment measures ===
Since 1996, the center has been a leader in the fight against onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness – a parasitic disease transmitted by the bites of black flies.

The center currently works to stop the spread of the disease in six countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan, Uganda, and Venezuela, helping residents and local health workers institute and sustain drug treatment programs and health education activities. The center contributed to the efforts that successfully eliminated river blindness transmission in Columbia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico.

The center has helped to distribute more than 500 million doses of Mectizan (ivermectin) – a drug donated by Merck &amp; Co., Inc., that treats and prevents river blindness.

Center health workers also prevent transmission of trachoma – a bacterial infection that is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Trachoma is prevalent in places that lack the tools for basic hygiene, clean water, and adequate sanitation.

The Center follows the World Health Organization&#x27;s four-pronged approach – called the SAFE strategy – to fight trachoma in six African countries. The Trachoma Control Program is working to improve sanitation in those communities by building latrines, providing corrective surgery, distributing antibiotics, and educating communities on basic hygiene.

, The Carter Center has helped to build more than one million latrines in its effort to fight trachoma.

The latrines contain human waste, preventing it from serving as a breeding ground for the disease-carrying flies, thereby reducing one way the disease is spread.

Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are mosquito-borne diseases also targeted by The Carter Center. The center has distributed four million long-lasting insecticidal bed nets. It has also established drug distribution systems in Nigeria to treat and stem the spread of lymphatic filariasis and schistosomiasis.

=== Training public health workers ===
The Carter Center believes in building networks of village-based health care workers to treat people for various diseases at the same time. Emphasis is on helping national and local governments establish programs that they can sustain into the future.

Since 1997, the center established with the Ethiopian ministries of health and education the Ethiopia Public Health Training Initiative to improve academic training for health care personnel in Ethiopia and increase access to health care in rural communities throughout the country.

=== Strengthening agricultural production ===
In partnership with the Sasakawa Africa Association, the center has worked since 1986 in 15 sub-Saharan African countries to teach 8–10 million small-scale farmers improved techniques that double or triple their crop yields.

The program promotes use of fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, soil fertility, and environmentally friendly agronomic methods of crop production. It also supports efforts to construct quality grain storage to sustain market prices for the farmer and ensure greater food security, establish farmers&#x27; associations, and use quality food crops such as high-protein maize.

=== Reducing stigma of mental illness ===
Rosalynn Carter led the center&#x27;s efforts to fight stigma associated with mental illness. The center works to spread awareness about mental health issues, increase equity in mental health care, shape public policy, and advocate for the rights of people with mental illnesses.

In its Global Behavioral Health Initiative, the center partnered with the Liberian Ministries of Health and Education to create a program to train mental health clinicians to serve in communities within Liberia. Over 300 Liberians have completed the training to become credentialed mental health clinicians, and 140 of these clinicians specialize in child and adolescent care. The initiative has also explored the linkages between mental health and other global health issues, such as looking into the impact of mental health support on people with neglected tropical diseases.

The Carter Center works to inform public policy in Georgia to make behavioral health services accessible by helping implement and enforce parity laws, expanding school-based behavioral health services for youth, and increasing the availability of care for older adults with mental illness. In 2022, the Georgia General Assembly passed the Mental Health Parity Act in a unanimous vote, ensuring that insurance plans cover behavioral health equally to physical health.

Through the Rosalynn Carter Fellowship for Mental Health Journalism, the center supports and trains journalists from around the world to increase reporting on behavioral health issues and reduce discrimination against people with mental illnesses. To date, more than 250 journalists have participated in the program.

Building on its journalism fellowship program, the center launched its Mental Health Parity Newsroom Collaborative in 2022, to investigate coverage of mental health care and reduce inequities in the U.S. In 2024, the cohort included more than 40 reporters and editors from over 15 news outlets.

For the past 32 years, the center has held an annual symposium on mental health policy with national leaders in mental health and other fields.

== Accolades ==
Jimmy Carter received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work through the Carter Center. The Carter Center received the inaugural Delta Prize for Global Understanding in 1999—an award administered by the University of Georgia.

In 2006, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation presented the Carter Center with the Gates Award for Global Health.

The center was awarded Hamdan Award for Volunteers in Humanitarian Medical Services for 2013–14.

=== Annual weekend ===
Since 1992, the Carter Center has organized an annual weekend. In 2019, for the first time, part of the event program was opened to the media, a discussion on human rights. An important part of the event is an auction that raised $1.6 million in 2013 and $4 million in 2018.

== Funding ==
In 2007, Alan Dershowitz, an American attorney, alleged on a pro-Israel website that the center&#x27;s focus &quot;is away from significant Arab abuses and on Israel&#x27;s far less serious ones&quot; and that this is influenced by the center&#x27;s receipt of donations from Arab sources. One of the initial contributors to the center was Bank of Commerce and Credit International founder Agha Hasan Abedi, who donated $500,000. Abedi and BCCI also donated $8 million to Carter&#x27;s Global 2000 project.

According to the center, which discloses all donations over $1,000, 2.5 percent of the total amount of contributions it has received since its founding in 1982 thru 2016 were from donors in Middle East Arab nations.

Of the donations from the Middle East, the center stated that:

<text>Logit analysis is a statistical technique used in marketing research. It can be applied with regression analysis to customer targeting and to assess effectiveness of promotional activities.

Used to assess the scope of customer acceptance of a new product, it attempts to determine the intensity or magnitude of customers&#x27; purchase intentions and translates that into a measure of actual buying behaviour. Logit analysis assumes that an unmet need in the marketplace has already been detected, and that the product has been designed to meet that need. The purpose of logit analysis is to quantify the potential sales of that product. It takes survey data on consumers&#x27; purchase intentions and converts it into actual purchase probabilities.

Logit analysis defines the functional relationship between stated purchase intentions and preferences, and the actual probability of purchase. A preference regression is performed on the survey data. This is then modified with actual historical observations of purchase behavior. The resultant functional relationship defines purchase probability.

This is the most useful of the purchase intention/rating translations because explicit measures of confidence level and statistical significance can be calculated. Other purchase intention/rating translations include the preference-rank translation and the intent scale translation.
The logit function is the reciprocal function to the sigmoid logistic function.

<doc id="265366" wikidata="Q3248954" url="?curid=265366" title="List of cuisines">
<text>A cuisine is a specific set of cooking traditions and practices, often associated with a specific culture or region. Each cuisine involves food preparation in a particular style, of food and drink of particular types, to produce individually consumed items or distinct meals. A cuisine is frequently named after the region or place where it originated. A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Religious food laws can also exercise a strong influence on such culinary practices.

== Regional and ethnic cuisines ==
Global cuisine is a cuisine that is practiced around the world. A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions, often associated with a specific region, country or culture. To become a global cuisine, a local, regional or national cuisine must spread around the world with its food served worldwide.

Regional cuisine is based upon national, state or local regions. Regional cuisines may vary based upon food availability and trade, varying climates, cooking traditions and practices, and cultural differences. One noteworthy definition is based upon &quot;traditional cuisine&quot;: &quot;A traditional cuisine is a coherent tradition of food preparation that rises from the daily lives and kitchens of a people over an extended period in a specific region of a country, or a specific country, and which, when localized, has notable distinctions from the cuisine of the country as a whole.&quot;

<text>Susan Ioannou (born October 4, 1944) is a Canadian poet who lives in Toronto, Ontario.

== Biography ==
Ioannou was born October 4, 1944, to Frank and Margaret Thomas. As a young child, she wrote fiction, but by her teen years, she wrote more poetry than fiction. In 1966 she received her bachelor&#x27;s degree and a year later, her master&#x27;s degree from the University of Toronto. While attending the University of Toronto, she received the school&#x27;s Nora Epstein Foundation award for poetry.

In August 1967 she married Lazaros Ioannou.

Ioannou taught English at Bloor Collegiate Institute, for six years during the 1970s. In 1973, she was the Vice-President of the Ontario Council of Teachers of English.

From 1980 to 1989, she served as Associate Editor of &quot;Cross Canada Writers&#x27; Quarterly.&quot; She also served as editor of &quot;Coiffure du Canada&quot; (1979-1980), co-editor of &quot;Poemata&quot; (1988-1989), and poetry editor for &quot;Arts Scarborough Newsletter&quot; (1980-1985).

Into the 1990s, Ioannou led poetry workshops for the Toronto Board of Education, Ryerson University, and University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies. In 1985, she founded the writers&#x27; resource Wordwrights Canada, and in 1988, created its poetry course, which until 2017 ran online as Lessons in Writing the Poem.

Her poetry has inspired music by contemporary composers, Norwegian Gjermund Andreassen and Canadian Leslie Uyeda.

== Work ==
Iannou&#x27;s writing has appeared in a variety of anthologies including &quot;The Canlit Food Book&quot; (1987), &quot;Celebrating Canadian Women&quot; (1989), &quot;Kitchen Talk: Contemporary Women&#x27;s Prose and Poetry&quot; (1992), &quot;Crossing Boundaries: An International Anthology of Women&#x27;s Experiences in Sport&quot; (1999), and &quot;Myth Weavers&quot; (2007). Her poems have been published in numerous literary journals, including &quot;The Antigonish Review&quot;, &quot;Descant&quot;, &quot;The Prairie Journal of Canadian Literature&quot;, &quot;Prism International&quot;, &quot;Malahat Review&quot; and &quot;Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;.

Ioannou describes her process of writing poetry as &quot;meditative&quot; and that she draws from &quot;details of everyday life.&quot; In one interview, Ioannou remarked, &quot;Whenever I write poetry, I am relentlessly dissatisfied. Again and again, I try (and fail) to reach one ideal: In the largest meaning of the word, to be true. I admire any poet who can teach me how to give words a nugget&#x27;s solid brilliance, how to make lines stretch or snap, how to lift a poem on a shout or a song. I am always searching for the poem that can instruct and amaze me. This search drove my literary study &quot;A Magical Clockwork.&quot;&quot;

In reviewing one of Ioannou&#x27;s earliest works, &quot;Motherpoems&quot;, Louise Longo wrote that &quot;Ioannou&#x27;s work, at its best, has a street-wise toughness, coupled with an eye for detail that is effective. Unfortunately many of her poems are in need of ruthless editing.&quot; While Longo praised the emotional range of Ioannou&#x27;s poems in this volume, she also perceived a judgmental attitude toward women who were not mothers and an assumption that women ultimately find fulfillment in motherhood alone.

Her poetry has been favorably reviewed by Mark Cochrane who describes her collection &quot;Clarity between Clouds&quot; as a reboot of the &quot;quest for clarity and solidity in a blurry and crumbling posthumanist epoch.&quot;

Ioannou&#x27;s book of poems about minerals and rocks, &quot;Looking Through Stone: Poems About the Earth&quot; was distributed in Ontario schools as part of a specialist curriculum. Her interest in writing about geology grew when her son was completing his PhD work. Ioannou relates that she spent ten years learning and reading about geology and whenever something interested her, she tried to create a poem based on that idea.

In 1990, Ioannou received the Memorial Award for nonfiction from the Media Club of Canada and, in 1997, the Okanaga Short Story Award, as well as several grants from the Ontario Arts Council.

Of her 2016 poetry collection &quot;Looking for Light&quot;, reviewer Sharon Berg writes: &quot;She has a grasp of the element of time that stretches beyond her own stand on this earth and her poetry manages both to enlighten and delight us.&quot;

<doc id="265407" wikidata="Q1255331" url="?curid=265407" title="Isinglass">
<text>Isinglass ( ) is a form of collagen obtained from the dried swim bladders of fish. The English word origin is from the obsolete Dutch &quot;huizenblaas&quot; – &quot;huizen&quot; is a kind of sturgeon, and &quot;blaas&quot; is a bladder, or German &quot;Hausenblase&quot;, meaning essentially the same. The bladders, once removed from the fish, processed, and dried, are formed into various shapes for use.

It is used mainly for the clarification or fining of some beer and wine. It can also be cooked into a paste for specialised gluing purposes.

Although originally made exclusively from sturgeon, especially beluga, in 1795 an invention by William Murdoch facilitated a cheap substitute using cod. This was extensively used in Britain in place of Russian isinglass, and in the US hake was important. In modern British brewing all commercial isinglass products are blends of material from a limited range of tropical fish. 

== Foods and drinks ==
Before the inexpensive production of gelatin and other competing products, isinglass was used in confectionery and desserts such as fruit jelly and &quot;blancmange&quot;.

Isinglass finings are widely used as a processing aid in the British brewing industry to accelerate the fining, or clarification, of beer. It is used particularly in the production of cask-conditioned beers, although many cask ales are available which are not fined using isinglass. The finings flocculate the live yeast in the beer into a jelly-like mass, which settles to the bottom of the cask. Left undisturbed, beer will clear naturally; the use of isinglass finings accelerates the process. Isinglass is sometimes used with an auxiliary fining, which further accelerates the process of sedimentation.

Non-cask beers that are destined for kegs, cans, or bottles are often pasteurised and filtered. The yeast in these beers tends to settle to the bottom of the storage tank naturally, so the sediment from these beers can often be filtered without using isinglass. However, some breweries still use isinglass finings for non-cask beers, especially when attempting to repair bad batches.

Many vegetarians consider beers that are processed with these finings (such as most cask-conditioned ales in the UK) to be unsuitable for vegetarian diets (although acceptable for pescetarians). According to global data in 2018, along with low-calorie beer and gluten-free beer, beers that are acceptable for strict vegetarians are expected to grow in demand in the coming years. The demand increase is attributed to millennial consumers, and some companies have introduced vegetarian friendly options or done away with isinglass use. A beer-fining agent that is suitable for vegetarians is Irish moss, a type of red algae containing the polymer chemical carrageenan. However, carrageenan-based products (used in both the boiling process and after fermentation) primarily reduce hazes caused by proteins, but isinglass is used at the end of the brewing process, after fermentation, to remove yeast. Since the two fining agents act differently (on different haze-forming particles), they are not interchangeable, and some beers use both.

Isinglass finings are also used in the production of kosher wines, although for reasons of kashrut, they are not derived from the beluga sturgeon, because this fish is not kosher. Whether the use of a nonkosher isinglass renders a beverage nonkosher is a matter of debate in Jewish law. Rabbi Yehezkel Landau, in &quot;Noda B&#x27;Yehuda&quot;, first edition, Yore Deah 26, for example, permits such beverages. This is the position followed by many kashrut-observant Jews today.

The similar-sounding names has resulted in confusion between isinglass and waterglass, especially as both have been used to preserve eggs. A solution of isinglass was applied to eggs and allowed to dry, sealing their pores. Waterglass is sodium silicate. Eggs were submerged in solutions of waterglass, and a gel of silicic acid formed, also sealing the pores of the eggshell.

== Conservation ==

Isinglass is also used as an adhesive to repair parchment, stucco and damage to paintings on canvas. Pieces of the best Russian isinglass are soaked overnight to soften and swell the dried material. Next, it is cooked slowly in a double boiler at 45 °C while being stirred. A small amount of gum tragacanth dissolved in water is added to the strained isinglass solution to act as an emulsifier.

When repairing paint that is flaking from parchment, isinglass can be applied directly to an area which has been soaked with a small amount of ethanol. It is typically applied as a very tiny drop that is then guided, with the help of a binocular microscope, under the edges of flaking paint.

It can also be used to coat tissue or goldbeater&#x27;s skin. On paintings this can be used as a temporary backing to either canvas patches or filler until dried. Here, isinglass is similar to parchment size and other forms of gelatin, but it is unique in that as a dried film the adhesive can be reactivated with moisture. For this use, the isinglass is cooked with a few drops of glycerin or honey.
This adhesive is advantageous in situations where minimal use of water is desired for the parchment as the isinglass can be reactivated with an ethanol-water mixture. It also has a greater adhesive strength than many other adhesives used for parchment repair.

== In popular culture ==

In the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, the song &quot;The Surrey With the Fringe on Top&quot; describes the surrey as having &quot;isinglass curtains you can roll right down&quot; although here the term refers to mica, commonly used for windows in vehicle side screens (but totally inflexible). Mentioned several times in chapter 68 of Moby Dick by Herman Melville, in a discussion of whale skin and blubber.
Mentioned in &quot;The Book of Life&quot; by Deborah Harkness, &quot;her scales fell like isinglass&quot;, in reference to the scales of a fire drake named Corra, and in Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Gilded Age&quot; where he describes a furnace door which &quot;framed a small square of isinglass...&quot; (chapter seven).

<text>The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy is an interactive fiction video game based on the comedic science fiction series of the same name. It was designed by series creator Douglas Adams and Infocom&#x27;s Steve Meretzky, and it was first released in 1984 for the Apple II, Mac, Commodore 64, CP/M, MS-DOS, Amiga, Atari 8-bit computers, and Atari ST. It is Infocom&#x27;s fourteenth game.

==Plot==

The game loosely mirrors a portion of the series&#x27; plot, representing most of the events in the first book. Arthur Dent wakes up one day to find his house about to be destroyed by a construction crew to make way for a new bypass. His friend Ford Prefect, who is secretly an extraterrestrial, helps to calm Arthur down and hitches them a ride on one of the ships in the approaching Vogon constructor fleet, moments before the fleet destroys the Earth to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.

Aboard the ship, Arthur learns that Ford is a journalist for &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and has been on Earth researching the planet for the Guide. The two are discovered by Vogons and subjected by the captain to a reading of his poetry. The two manage to survive this, and the Vogons throw them into the airlock and shoot them out into space. By a huge improbability, they are picked up in the last moment before they die of asphyxiation by the spacecraft &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; while it is traveling on Infinite Improbability Drive. After getting safely aboard the ship, Arthur and Ford meet Ford&#x27;s friend Zaphod Beeblebrox, who had stolen the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; as his first act of office as the Galactic President, as well as Arthur&#x27;s friend Trillian (Tricia McMillan), whom Zaphod had picked up from a party on Earth. Zaphod wants to travel to the legendary planet of Magrathea, believing it to hold a great secret.

At this point, Zaphod leaves the task of getting to Magrathea to the ship&#x27;s computer Eddie, and he, Ford, and Trillian depart to the ship&#x27;s sauna. Arthur finds Eddie incapable of getting to Magrathea without help. Arthur initially tries to help by supplying the Infinite Improbability Drive with a tea substitute from the ship&#x27;s Nutrimatic device to serve as a source of Brownian motion, but this only causes Arthur to temporarily take on the consciousness of Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian in their respective pasts, and he must manipulate events such that items in these past periods are brought aboard the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; in the present. Through this, Arthur gains enough parts as to replace the circuit board in the Nutrimatic so that it can produce real tea. This tea is powerful enough to power the Drive to get them to Magrathea, but in orbit, the ship is attacked by two missiles from the surface. Arthur employs the Drive again to change the missiles into a sperm whale and a bowl of petunias, neutralizing the threat.

The ship prepares to land, but the computer will not let them do so. Again, the other three head off to the sauna, leaving Arthur to figure out how to fix this. This requires Arthur to reach Marvin the Paranoid Android&#x27;s closet on the ship in order to get the final tools needed to fix the computer and get it to land. The game ends as Arthur and the others are about to set foot on Magrathea.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; is a text adventure game in which the player, in the role of Arthur Dent, solves a number of puzzles to complete various objectives to win the game. This includes collecting and using a number of inventory items. The player has a limited variety of commands to observe, move about, and interact with the game&#x27;s world, such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 (to move north), codice_4, or codice_5. Most commands will advance the game&#x27;s turn counter, and some puzzles require the player to complete it within a fixed number of turns or else the game may end and require the player to restart at the beginning or a saved state; passive commands like &quot;look&quot; and &quot;inventory&quot;, or mistyped or non-comprehended commands, do not count as turns. Once the player has acquired the eponymous &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, a wide variety of topics can be asked about, some of which may be helpful in solving the game&#x27;s puzzles.

In both the game&#x27;s 20th- and 30th-anniversary editions, the game&#x27;s interface is augmented with graphics that help to map out the locations and other features, though the player is still required to type in all commands.

==Feelies==

Most Infocom games contained &quot;feelies&quot;, bonus novelty items included to enhance the immersiveness of the game. The feelies provided with this game included:
*A pin-on button with &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic!&quot; printed in large, friendly letters
*A small plastic packet containing &quot;pocket fluff&quot; (a cottonball)
*Order for destruction of Arthur Dent&#x27;s house
*Order for destruction of Earth written in &quot;Vogon&quot; (actually an English cryptogram written in a thinly-disguised Greek alphabet. The text was nearly identical to that of the English Order for Destruction)
*Official Microscopic Space Fleet (an empty plastic bag)
*&quot;Peril Sensitive Sunglasses&quot; (a pair of opaque black cardboard &quot;sunglasses&quot;)
*&quot;How Many Times Has This Happened to You?&quot;, an advertising brochure for the fictional guidebook/encyclopedia &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;
*&quot;No tea: Just like the tea professional hitchhikers don&#x27;t carry!&quot; (in fact, nothing)

==Reception==
&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; gained a reputation for deviousness. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reported on rumors that &quot;several important people within the [video game] industry cannot (snicker, snicker!!!) even get out of [the] first room!&quot; Jerry Pournelle advised non-readers of the novel against playing the game, and warned that &quot;even if you&#x27;ve memorized the book, these puzzles are &quot;hard&quot;&quot;. Perhaps the most notorious instance involved getting a Babel Fish out of a dispenser in the hold of the Vogon ship, which would translate the Vogon language to English. This tricky puzzle appeared early in the game and required the player to use a variety of obscure items in a specific fashion, some which had to be obtained in earlier, but non-revisitable, sections of the game, to create a Heath Robinson (or Rube Goldberg)-like chain of events. The puzzle further had to be &quot;solved&quot; within a limited number of turns. Failure to &quot;solve&quot; the Babel Fish puzzle did not kill the player, but rendered the remainder of the game unwinnable, as one subsequent puzzle requires the player to gain a passcode based on Vogon-written instructions, otherwise undecipherable without the Fish. That particular puzzle became so notorious for its difficulty that Infocom wound up selling T-shirts bearing the legend, &quot;I got the Babel Fish!&quot; Adams stated that the puzzle&#x27;s difficulty, and the notable game play change that it begins, was intentional; &quot;Just as the player gets comfortable in the narrow neck, the bottom drops out!&quot;

&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was very successful. It sold 59,000 copies in 1984—in second place among Infocom games, after &quot;Zork I&quot;—and with 166,000 copies it was the company&#x27;s best-selling title in 1985, more than twice as many as &quot;Wishbringer&quot;. Based on sales and market-share data, &quot;Video&quot; magazine listed the game fourth on its list of best selling video games in February 1985, and third on the best seller list in March 1985, with &quot;II Computing&quot; listing it sixth on the magazine&#x27;s list of top Apple II games as of October–November 1985. Its sales had surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989. &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; ultimately sold 400,000 copies, and was one of the best-selling titles of its time.

&quot;Video&quot; in March 1985 praised the game&#x27;s fidelity to its source material, stating that &quot;it survives the transition as wacky and spaced-out as ever&quot;. Though acknowledging that &quot;there may be a few minor problems with &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;&quot;, the reviewer suggested that &quot;the game is so engrossing, funny, and often so infuriatingly difficult that you&#x27;ll hardly notice them&quot;. In May 1985 &quot;Antic&quot; called it an &quot;extraordinary game&quot; and &quot;a step forward from Infocom&#x27;s safe, established approach to game design&quot; with &quot;distinct and tangible&quot; writing, &quot;really the first stylistic departure since the &quot;Zork&quot; trilogy&quot;. The magazine stated that &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; was &quot;not your run-of-the-mill text adventure&quot; but promised that &quot;the puzzles are tough, but follow a certain capricious, twisted internal logic&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; in June 1985 stated that the game &quot;may well be Infocom&#x27;s best effort to date&quot;, citing an effective adaptation of Adams&#x27;s &quot;comic absurdity&quot;, sense of humor, and &quot;fascinating&quot; story. The magazine &quot;recommended [it] for all adventure gamers&quot;, and listed the game in May 1988 as one of &quot;Our Favorite Games&quot;, stating that its humor distinguished &quot;Hitchhiker&quot; from other adventure games; &quot;[Adams&#x27;] keen and literate wit make this game a joy&quot;. &quot;Compute!&quot; gave it the 1989 Compute! Choice Award for Role Playing/Adventure Game.

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; listed &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; at #42 among their top 150 best games of all-time, writing that &quot;Douglas Adams&#x27; humor comes alive in this text adventure&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was one of five top-selling Infocom games to be produced in Solid Gold versions, with a built-in hint system not included in the originals. The game was re-released by Activision in several collection packages before rights reverted to Adams, enabling The Digital Village to re-release it as a web-based Java applet. Originally published as a fund-raising tool on the 1997 &quot;Comic Relief&quot; website, it took up permanent residence on Adams&#x27; own website the following year.

The original text-only version appeared in the Game On video games exhibition, which has toured museums worldwide since 2002, representing the text-based genre of video games.

On 21 September 2004 the BBC launched the 20th Anniversary Edition to coincide with the initial radio broadcast of the &quot;Tertiary Phase&quot;. Sporting a Flash user interface, and illustrated by Rod Lord (who also produced the guide animations for the Hitchhiker&#x27;s TV series), it won the Interactive BAFTA Award for Best Online Entertainment.

In 2014, a 30th Anniversary Edition was made available at the BBC.

===Sequel===
A proposed sequel, &quot;Milliways: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, which was to continue from the ending of the original, had problems from the start of development in 1985, until it was cancelled in 1989. This was due primarily down to the facts that there was &quot;no solid game design, nobody to program it, and the backdrop of Infocom&#x27;s larger economic problems&quot;. The beginning stages of the game were leaked in April 2008; however, the majority of it had yet to be written by the time it was cancelled.

<text> (, ) is a German national weekly newspaper published in Hamburg in Germany. The newspaper is generally considered to be among the German newspapers of record and is known for its long and extensive articles.

==History==
The first edition of was first published in Hamburg on 21 February 1946. The founding publishers were Gerd Bucerius, Lovis H. Lorenz, Richard Tüngel and Ewald Schmidt di Simoni. Marion Gräfin Dönhoff joined as an editor in March 1946. She became publisher of from 1972 until her death in 2002. In 1983 she was joined by former German chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Later Josef Joffe and former German federal secretary of culture Michael Naumann joined them as well.

The paper&#x27;s publishing house, Zeitverlag Gerd Bucerius in Hamburg, is owned by the Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group and Dieter von Holtzbrinck Media. The paper is published weekly on Thursdays.

As of 2018, has additional offices in Brussels, Dresden, Frankfurt, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Istanbul, Washington, D.C., and Vienna. In 2018, it re-opened an office in Beijing.

=== Founder biographies ===
Gerd Bucerius was a founding member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in 1945, Bucerius envisioned Die Zeit as a platform to promote knowledge, culture, and democratic values in a recovering Germany. Through the ZEIT-Stiftung (the Bucerius Foundation), he supported various cultural, educational, and social projects, fostering academic research and democratic engagement. After losing his position as a judge in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazis, Bucerius and his first wife, who was Jewish, fled to the United Kingdom, where he continued his legal practice, defending numerous Jewish clients and others targeted by the Nazi regime.

Lovis H. Lorenz was an art historian, journalist, and writer from Hamburg. He was granted a license by the British occupation authorities, which facilitated the founding of &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. His contributions to the newspaper are less documented, as he left the circle of partners at an early stage. His background in editing prior to the war provided essential experience for the newspaper&#x27;s early development. 

Marion Gräfin Dönhoff was a German anti-Nazi journalist and publisher who joined &quot;Die Zeit&quot; as an editor shortly after its founding in 1946. Dönhoff played a significant role in the 1944 assassination attempt against Hitler and became an advocate for German reconciliation with Eastern Europe. Dönhoff&#x27;s contributions helped shape &quot;Die Zeit&quot; into a platform for liberal thought, and she remained influential in German journalism until her death in 2002. She played an essential role in shaping the newspaper&#x27;s liberal stance and editorial direction, advocating for German reconciliation with Eastern Europe. 

Ewald Schmidt di Simoni was a publishing salesman in the 1930s who was later banned from his profession because he was married to a Jewish woman. After the war he was granted a license by the British for his services, contributing to the establishment of &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. 

Richard Tüngel was Hamburg&#x27;s city planning officer until he was dismissed by the National Socialists in 1933. He co-founded &quot;Die Zeit&quot; and served as its second editor-in-chief. After publishing an article by Carl Schmitt, a former Nazi lawyer, &quot;Marion Gräfin Dönhoff&quot; resiged in protest. Bucerius ultimately decided to remove Tüngel from his position 1956.

Czeschka was inspired by the British daily newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; which shows the British national coat of arms in between &quot;The&quot; and &quot;Times&quot;. This was not only for graphic reasons, it also represented the founder&#x27;s self-conception which he published in an editorial called &quot;&quot; (&quot;Our Mission&quot;) on 21 February 1946.

The very first version of Czeschka&#x27;s design, which included the Hamburg crest, was used from the first edition (published on 21 February 1946) to the 12th edition (published on 9 May 1946). Other than the official coat of arms this crest featured peacock&#x27;s feathers with little hearts on them. Additionally, the position of the lions&#x27; legs first resembled those of the old great coat of arms. The positions were changed in 1952. Regardless of this tiny difference, the crest was viewed as the great Hamburg coat of arms by the Hamburg Senate and was therefore considered a national emblem. Upon this, the crest was revised: An open gate was supposed to be incorporated to represent the cosmopolitanism of the hanseatic city. However, the Senate also declined this version that was printed in editions 13 to 18, as it was viewed a misuse of a national emblem for commercial purposes, which is still prohibited to this day. To avoid another prohibition, &quot;Zeit Magazin&quot; changed its masthead on 27 June 1946, into the Coat of arms of Bremen: The key and the golden crown of the city coat of arms, which was approved by Wilhelm Kaisen, the mayor of Bremen. This happened as a result of the mediation from Josef Müller-Marein who later became the editorial director of . The design with the &quot;Bremer Schlüssel&quot; in its masthead was also designed by Carl Otto Czeschka and is used as the logo of the whole publishing group today. With the demand from Ernst Samhaber, the Hamburg artist Alfred Mahlau had created the whole first edition which had a five-column break. The edition was printed in the printing house Broscheck in Hamburg. At the same time, Czeschka had also drawn the headlines of the first edition for the different sections of the newspaper. The articles of and, especially the leading articles on the first page, are traditionally longer and more detailed than the ones of a daily newspaper. However, in the past few years many articles have been noticeably shorter and include more pictures. Since the redesign by Mario Garcia in January 1998, the headlines have been printed in &quot;Tiemann-Antiqua&quot;. The running texts are printed in &quot;Garamond&quot;, a font that is very frequently used in books.

 did not join the discussion about the return of the traditional German orthography, which was led by &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Bild&quot;. Starting in 1999, the newspaper used its in-house orthography which derived from the traditional orthography as well as from the different versions of the reformed orthography, which were edited by Dieter E. Zimmer. Since 2007, refrained from using the in-house orthography and started following the recommendations of the Duden.

In 1973, Brinkley married French artist Jean-François Allaux. They divorced in 1981. In 1982, Brinkley had a romantic relationship with Olivier Chandon de Brailles, heir to the Moët-Chandon Champagne fortune. The two met at Studio 54 in New York City at a party promoting a calendar in which Brinkley appeared. Chandon died a year later in a crash at a private pre-season practice session car race.

Her second marriage was in 1985 to musician Billy Joel. The two had met in 1983 on the Island of St Barts, in the Caribbean, and were married on March 23, 1985, on a yacht on the Hudson River; it was also Joel&#x27;s second marriage. Guests included singer Paul Simon and members of the band Stray Cats. The marriage ended in August 1994; they had one child, Alexa Ray Joel, born December 29, 1985. Brinkley and Billy Joel remain close friends.

In 1994, Brinkley was introduced to real estate developer Richard Taubman by a mutual friend. He proposed in May 1994 while she and Billy Joel were still married. She married Taubman on December 22, 1994, in Telluride, Colorado, near the area where they were both in a helicopter crash on April 1, 1994. Brinkley was 40 and Taubman was 46. She announced at their wedding that they were expecting a baby boy. The marriage ended in 1995 with one son, Jack Paris Brinkley, born June 2, 1995. In 1994, Brinkley survived a helicopter crash that occurred during a ski trip in Telluride, Colorado. As a result, she suffered years of hip pain, culminating in a full hip replacement in 2021.

Brinkley&#x27;s fourth marriage was in 1996, to architect Peter Halsey Cook. Cook and Brinkley met in 1979 when he was modeling. They were later reintroduced by a mutual friend and announced their engagement in August 1996. They married on September 21, 1996. They had one child, daughter Sailor Lee Brinkley Cook, born July 2, 1998 (who has also become a model). Brinkley&#x27;s representative announced in July 2006 that Brinkley and Peter Cook planned to separate. The couple reached a settlement in July 2008; accounts differ as to whether divorce was final on September 12, 2008, or October 3, 2008. In September 2015, it was widely reported that John Mellencamp was in a new relationship with Brinkley. In August 2016, the couple announced their separation after almost a year of dating.

===Interests===
Brinkley lives on Long Island in Sag Harbor, New York; she previously lived in Bridgehampton and Amagansett, Long Island. She and her children are fans of the New York Islanders ice hockey team. Brinkley began doing promotions for the team after being noticed at games. In 2007, she showed her support by writing a blog for NHL.com and filming a commercial. Brinkley helped found a club for cutting, an equestrian sport in which a rider has two and a half minutes to cut as many cattle from a herd as he or she can.

Since 1998, Brinkley has given nearly $1,000,000 to organizations and candidates of the Democratic Party of the United States, including Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Democratic National Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, America Coming Together and Moveon.org. In the New York delegation, Brinkley served as a delegate on the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. She has also been involved in anti-nuclear activities and campaigned against the restarting of the High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR) located at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Brinkley supports animal rights, most notably through the organization PETA, having previously spoken out against the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. She became a vegetarian when she was 13 years old and then got her entire family to become vegetarians.

<doc id="265416" wikidata="Q605830" url="?curid=265416" title="Orangina">
<text>Orangina () is a lightly carbonated beverage made from carbonated water, 12% citrus juice (10% from concentrated orange, 2% from a combination of concentrated lemon, concentrated mandarin, and concentrated grapefruit juices), as well as 2% orange pulp. Orangina is sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup (glucose fructose) and in some markets (such as the United Kingdom) with artificial sweetener. Natural flavours are also added.

Orangina was innovated by Spanish pharmacist, Agustín Trigo Miralles, as Naranjina in the early 1930s. He subsequently sold the formula to Léon Beton, a French businessman based in French Algeria, in 1935. Today, it is a popular beverage in Europe (especially in France and Switzerland), Japan, North Africa, and to a lesser extent in North America.

Since November 2009, the Orangina brand has been owned by Suntory in most of the world. In the United States and Canada, it is marketed by &quot;Ventures Food and Beverage&quot; since 2020, as a result of a licensing agreement with Suntory. It was previously made by Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Canada Dry Motts.

== History ==

The history of &quot;Orangina&quot; began with the encounter at the 1935 Marseille Trade Fair between Léon Beton, a French businessman living in Colonial Algeria, and a Spanish pharmacist from Valencia, Dr Agustin Trigo. The latter presented his innovation, &quot;Naranjina&quot;. The drink was created from a mix of citrus juices, carbonated water, sugar and other ingredients. Beton, owner of an orange grove in the plain of Mitidja and successful essential oil merchant, bought the beverage&#x27;s formula; and the first bottle of &quot;Orangina, soda de naranjina&quot; was launched in France the same year. However, the outbreak of major conflicts in Europe, notably the Spanish Civil War and World War II, hampered the brand’s expansion.

His son, Jean-Claude Beton, took over the company in 1947. Jean-Claude Beton kept most of the original recipe, which he marketed to appeal to European and North African consumers. Orangina quickly became a common beverage throughout French North Africa. In 1951, Jean-Claude Beton introduced Orangina&#x27;s signature 250 ml bottle, which became a symbol of the brand. The bottle recalls the rounded shape of an orange, with a glass texture designed to mimic the fruit.

Production was moved to Marseille in metropolitan France in 1962 in the run-up to Algeria&#x27;s independence. The company joined the Pernod Ricard group in 1984.

In 2000, after an attempt to sell to Coca-Cola was blocked on anti competitive grounds, the Orangina brand was acquired by Cadbury Schweppes along with Pernod Ricard&#x27;s other soda businesses. In 2006, Cadbury decided to concentrate on the chocolate business and sought buyers for its soda business. As the number three soda producer globally, neither of the bigger two (Coca-Cola or PepsiCo) could buy it, so eventually the soda company was split up to sell.

===North America===
In 1978, the drink was introduced in the United States under the name Orelia, but this name was abandoned in favour of the original in 1985. Orangina was produced for the North American market in Canada, but the operation was moved to Hialeah, Florida, United States, to be produced under licence by Mott&#x27;s LLP of Rye Brook, New York. After being spun off from Cadbury Schweppes&#x27; former North American soft drinks business, the brand was owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (now Keurig Dr Pepper). Production of Orangina moved back to Canada. 

As with other carbonated beverages in the US market, Orangina for the United States is sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup, instead of regular sugar like original Orangina. Orangina for the Canadian market is labelled as being sweetened with sugar and glucose-fructose. Orangina sweetened only with sugar was also imported by Canada Dry Motts from Europe for the Canadian market. 

In 2020, Suntory assumed the brand in North America and licensed it to Ventures Foods and Beverage. However, as of 2024, the product has all but disappeared from the United States market and no information on its status can be found.

===Rest of the world===

From 2006, private equity firms Blackstone Group and Lion Capital LLP owned the brand outside North America under the company name Orangina Schweppes. In November 2009, its ownership changed once again when it was bought by Japanese brewer Suntory. In Great Britain, it was formerly manufactured under licence by AG Barr of Glasgow, most famous for Irn-Bru, this has recently been taken in house by Suntory subsidiary Lucozade Ribena Suntory

Orangina is produced in Vietnam by Fosters Vietnam under licence and is sold in Carrefour branches in Taiwan. It is produced in Iran by Shemshad Noosh Co.

== Brand owners and distributors ==
== Packaging ==

The brand is famous for the design of its 25 cl (8 oz) bottle made in the shape of a pear with a pebbly texture meant to recall the peel of an orange or other citrus fruit. Larger bottles also include the pebbly texture but use a more regular bottle shape rather than maintaining the proportions of the smaller bottles.

== Varieties ==
New flavours have emerged in Europe including Orangina Sanguine which is made from blood oranges and also contains caffeine and guarana. It is significantly more sour than regular Orangina. Other flavours such as the series called &quot;les givrés&quot; (which can be translated as both &quot;frosted&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot;) are also available in Europe, but rarely seen in North America. The sugar free variant &quot;Miss O&quot; was launched in the 2010s.

In Tunisia, multiple flavours of Orangina are sold as Orangina Rouge, similar to the European Orangina Sanguine, and Orangina Light as a sugar free variant.

== Advertising ==
The pulp at the bottom of the bottles was a big flaw compared to its competitors. It therefore took an original marketing positioning, which transformed this defect into a quality, with the &quot;Shake me&quot; advertisements.

In 2010, a gay-friendly Orangina commercial was released in France, a few weeks after a McDonald&#x27;s advertisement featuring a gay teenager was shown on French television.

=== Criticism of suggestive advertising===
In 2008, a commercial featuring anthropomorphic animals (such as a deer, a bear, peacocks, and chameleons) in swimsuits, caused outrage in the United Kingdom, for its sexually suggestive content. In the video, the animals gyrate around poles, spray the drink onto the breasts of other animals, and ride bottles which then explode. The advert had already had 45 seconds of more provocative footage cut, and was only to be shown after the 9 o&#x27;clock watershed, initially during a programme titled &quot;How to Look Good Naked&quot;. Kidscape, a children&#x27;s charity based in the country, criticised the advert, saying, &quot;Orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people, but this new advert places the product in a very sexualised and provocative context&quot;. The advert was also awarded &quot;Freakiest Advert of 2007&quot;, and was seventh place in &quot;Worst TV Ad of 2008&quot;. Others asserted that Orangina is not targeted just at children and is also a &quot;leading adult soft drink&quot; and that the advertisement is intended to create controversy and thus free publicity. The advertisement was popular, and by April 2008 had three million online viewings.

<doc id="265417" wikidata="Q3058369" url="?curid=265417" title="Spanish language in the Americas">
<text>The different dialects of the Spanish language spoken in the Americas are distinct from each other, as well as from those varieties spoken in the Iberian Peninsula and the Spanish Mediterranean islands—collectively known as Peninsular Spanish—and Spanish spoken elsewhere, such as in Equatorial Guinea, Western Sahara, or in the Philippines. There is great diversity among the various Latin American vernaculars, as there are no common traits shared by all of them which are not also in existence in one or more of the variants of Iberian Spanish. A general Latin American &quot;standard&quot; does, however, vary from the Castilian &quot;standard&quot; register used in television, music and, notably, in the dubbing industry. Of the more than 498 million people who speak Spanish as their native language, more than 455 million are in Latin America, the United States and Canada, as of 2022. The total amount of native and non-native speakers of Spanish as of October 2022 well-exceeds 595 million.

There are numerous regional particularities and idiomatic expressions within Spanish. In Latin American Spanish, for instance (such as in Mexico or Puerto Rico, or areas of the contiguous U.S.), loanwords directly from English are used with some frequency, with English or non-Spanish spellings left intact. For example, the Latin American Spanish word for &quot;computer&quot; is &quot;computadora&quot;, whereas the word used in Spain is &quot;ordenador&quot;, and each word sounds &quot;foreign&quot; in the region where it is not used. Some differences are due to Iberian Spanish having a stronger French and Mediterranean influence than Latin America, where, for geopolitical and social reasons, the United States&#x27; English-language influence has been predominant throughout the twentieth century. Another common loanword, used often in different American Spanish dialects, is a simple affirmative &quot;O.K.&quot; or &quot;okay&quot;, instead of &quot;sí&quot; or &quot;está bien&quot; (&quot;yes&quot;, or &quot;it&#x27;s good/okay&quot;).

== Main features ==
Pronunciation varies from country to country and from region to region, just as English pronunciation varies from one place to another. In general terms, the speech of the Americas shows many common features akin to southern Spanish variants, especially to western Andalusia (Seville, Cádiz) and the Canary Islands. Coastal language vernaculars throughout Hispanic America show particularly strong similarities to Atlantic-Andalusian speech patterns while inland regions in Mexico and Andean countries are not similar to any particular dialect in Spain.
*Most Spaniards pronounce and (before and ) as (called &quot;distinción&quot;). Conversely, most Hispanic Americans have &quot;seseo&quot;, lacking a distinction between this phoneme and . However, &quot;seseo&quot; is also typical of the speech of many Andalusians and all Canary islanders. Andalusia&#x27;s and the Canary Islands&#x27; predominant position in the conquest and subsequent immigration to Hispanic America from Spain is thought to be the reason for the absence of this distinction in most American Spanish dialects.
*Most of Spain, particularly the regions that have a distinctive phoneme, realize with the tip of tongue against the alveolar ridge. Phonetically this is an &quot;apico-alveolar&quot; &quot;grave&quot; sibilant , with a weak &quot;hushing&quot; sound reminiscent of fricatives. To a Hispanic American, Andalusian or Canary Island Spanish speaker, the in Spanish dialects from northern Spain might sound close to like English as in &quot;she&quot;. However, this apico-alveolar realization of is not uncommon in some Latin American Spanish dialects which lack ; some inland Colombian Spanish (particularly Antioquia) and Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia also have an apico-alveolar .
*The second-person familiar plural pronoun &quot;vosotros&quot; is not generally used in daily speech in Latin American dialects of Spanish; the formal &quot;ustedes&quot; is used at all levels of familiarity. However, &quot;vosotros&quot; and its conjugations are known and seen occasionally in writing or oratory, especially in formal, ritualized contexts.
*Latin America virtually lacks the found in a good deal of Spain, with this feature only being found commonly in Paraguay and the highlands of Ecuador. 
* As mentioned, Anglicisms are far more common in Hispanic America than in Spain, due to the stronger and more direct US influence. Anglicisms in Chile and Argentina are even very common mostly because of the influence of British settlers there.
* Equally, Indigenous languages have left their mark on Hispanic American Spanish, a fact which is particularly evident in vocabulary to do with flora, fauna and cultural habits. Nevertheless, European Spanish has also absorbed numerous words of Amerindian origin, although for historical reasons, the vast majority of these are taken from Nahuatl and various Caribbean languages.
* Arabic-derived words with Latinate doublets are common in Hispanic American Spanish, being influenced by Andalusian Spanish, such as &quot;alcoba&quot; (&quot;bedroom&quot;) instead of standard &quot;cuarto&quot;, &quot;recámara&quot;, and many others and &quot;alhaja&quot; (&quot;jewel&quot;) instead of standard &quot;joya&quot;. In this sense Hispanic American Spanish is closer to the dialects spoken in the south of Spain.
* See List of words having different meanings in Spain and Hispanic America.
* Most Hispanic American Spanish usually features &quot;yeísmo&quot;: there is no distinction between and . However realization varies greatly from region to region. Chileans pronounce these 2 graphemes as , for example. However, yeísmo is an expanding and now dominant feature of European Spanish, particularly in urban speech (Madrid, Toledo) and especially in Andalusia and the Canary Islands, though in some rural areas has not completely disappeared. Speakers of Rioplatense Spanish pronounce both and as or . The traditional pronunciation of the digraph as is preserved in some dialects along the Andes range, especially in inland Peru, the Sierra of Ecuador, and the Colombia highlands (Santander, Boyacá, Nariño), northern Argentina, all Bolivia and Paraguay; the Indigenous languages of these regions (Quechua, Guarani and Aymara) have as a distinct phoneme.
*Most speakers of coastal dialects may debuccalize or aspirate syllable-final to , or drop it entirely, so that &quot;está&quot; (&quot;s/he is&quot;) sounds like or , as in southern Spain (Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia, Castile–La Mancha (except the northeast), Madrid, the Canary Islands, Ceuta and Melilla).
* (before or ) and are usually aspirated to in Caribbean and other coastal language vernaculars, as well as in all of Colombia and southern Mexico, as in much of southern Spain. In other American dialects, the sound is closer to , and often firmly strong (rough) in Peruvian Spanish dialect. Very often, especially in Argentina and Chile, becomes fronter when preceding high vowels (these speakers approach to the realization of German in &quot;ich&quot;); in other phonological environments it is pronounced either or .
*In many Caribbean varieties, the phonemes and at the end of a syllable sound alike or can be exchanged: &quot;caldo&quot; &gt; &quot;ca[r]do&quot;, &quot;cardo&quot; &gt; &quot;ca[l]do&quot;; in the situation of in word-final position, it becomes silent, giving Caribbean dialects of Spanish a partial non-rhoticity. This happens at a reduced level in Ecuador and Chile as well. It is a feature brought from Extremadura and westernmost Andalusia.
*In many Andean regions, the alveolar trill of &quot;rata&quot; and &quot;carro&quot; is realized as an retroflex fricative or or even as a voiced apico-alveolar . The alveolar approximant realization is particularly associated with an Indigenous substrate and it is quite common in Andean regions, especially in inland Ecuador, Peru, most of Bolivia and in parts of northern Argentina and Paraguay. That phonetic is also heard in Costa Rica, except pronounced as [z].
*In Belize, Puerto Rico, and Colombian islands of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, aside from , , and , syllable-final can be realized as , an influence of American English to Puerto Rican dialect and British English to Belizean dialect and Colombian dialect of Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (in the case of the latter three, it is not exclusive to Colombians whose ancestors traced back to Spanish period before British invasion, under British territorial rule, and recovery of Spanish control, but is also used by Raizals, whites of British descent, and descendants of mainland Colombians); &quot;verso&quot;&#x27; (verse) becomes , aside from , , or , &quot;&quot;invierno&quot; (winter) becomes , aside from , , or , and &quot;escarlata&quot;&quot; (scarlet) becomes , aside from , , or []. In word-final position, will usually be one of the following:
** a trill, a tap, an approximant, , or elided when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;paterno&quot; (&#x27;paternal love&#x27;);
** a tap, an approximant, or when followed by a vowel-initial word, as in &quot;amo&quot; &quot;eterno&quot; (&#x27;eternal love&#x27;).
*In Chile and Costa Rica, consonant cluster [t] can be pronounced [], , or [], making &quot;cuatro&quot; &#x27;four&#x27; and &quot;trabajo&quot; &#x27;work&#x27; pronounced as [ and [ respectively. This is an influence of Mapudungun in Chile and native languages of Costa Rica.
*The voiced consonants , , and are pronounced as plosives after and sometimes before any consonant in most of Colombian Spanish dialects (rather than the fricative or approximant that is characteristic of most other dialects): &quot;pardo&quot; , &quot;barba&quot; , &quot;algo&quot; , &quot;peligro&quot; , &quot;desde&quot; —rather than the , , , , of Spain and the rest of Spanish America. A notable exception is the Department of Nariño and most &quot;Costeño&quot; speech (Atlantic coastal dialects) which feature the soft, fricative realizations common to all other Hispanic American and European dialects.
*Word-final is velar in much Latin American Spanish speech; this means a word like &quot;pan&quot; (bread) is often articulated . To an English-speaker, those speakers that have a velar nasal for word-final make &quot;pan&quot; sound like &quot;pang&quot;. Velarization of word-final is so widespread in the Americas that it is easier to mention those regions that maintain an alveolar : most of Mexico, Colombia (except for coastal dialects) and Argentina (except for some northern regions). Elsewhere, velarization is common, although alveolar word-final can appear among some educated speakers, especially in the media or in singing. Velar word-final is also frequent in Spain, especially in southern Spanish dialects (Andalusia and the Canary Islands) and in the Northwest: Galicia, Asturias and León.

<doc id="265421" wikidata="Q550134" url="?curid=265421" title="Inverted pendulum">
<text>An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and falls over without additional help. It can be suspended stably in this inverted position by using a control system to monitor the angle of the pole and move the pivot point horizontally back under the center of mass when it starts to fall over, keeping it balanced. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies. It is often implemented with the pivot point mounted on a cart that can move horizontally under control of an electronic servo system as shown in the photo; this is called a cart and pole apparatus. Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 degree of freedom by affixing the pole to an axis of rotation. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downward, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a torque at the pivot point, by moving the pivot point horizontally as part of a feedback system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the pivot point vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the pivot point in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one&#x27;s finger.

A second type of inverted pendulum is a tiltmeter for tall structures, which consists of a wire anchored to the bottom of the foundation and attached to a float in a pool of oil at the top of the structure that has devices for measuring movement of the neutral position of the float away from its original position.

== Overview ==
A pendulum with its bob hanging directly below the support pivot is at a stable equilibrium point, where it remains motionless because there is no torque on the pendulum. If displaced from this position, it experiences a restoring torque that returns it toward the equilibrium position. A pendulum with its bob in an inverted position, supported on a rigid rod directly above the pivot, 180° from its stable equilibrium position, is at an unstable equilibrium point. At this point again there is no torque on the pendulum, but the slightest displacement away from this position causes a gravitation torque on the pendulum that accelerates it away from equilibrium, causing it to fall over. 
In order to stabilize a pendulum in this inverted position, a feedback control system can be used, which monitors the pendulum&#x27;s angle and moves the position of the pivot point sideways when the pendulum starts to fall over, to keep it balanced. The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms (PID controllers, state-space representation, neural networks, fuzzy control, genetic algorithms, etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links, allowing the motion of the cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the center of gravity is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability. The understanding of a similar problem can be shown by simple robotics in the form of a balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one&#x27;s finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing personal transporters such as the Segway PT, the self-balancing hoverboard and the self-balancing unicycle.

Another way that an inverted pendulum may be stabilized, without any feedback or control mechanism, is by oscillating the pivot rapidly up and down. This is called Kapitza&#x27;s pendulum. If the oscillation is sufficiently strong (in terms of its acceleration and amplitude) then the inverted pendulum can recover from perturbations in a strikingly counterintuitive manner. If the driving point moves in simple harmonic motion, the pendulum&#x27;s motion is described by the Mathieu equation.

==Equations of motion==

The equations of motion of inverted pendulums are dependent on what constraints are placed on the motion of the pendulum. Inverted pendulums can be created in various configurations resulting in a number of Equations of Motion describing the behavior of the pendulum.

===Stationary pivot point===
In a configuration where the pivot point of the pendulum is fixed in space, the equation of motion is similar to that for an uninverted pendulum. The equation of motion below assumes no friction or any other resistance to movement, a rigid massless rod, and the restriction to 2-dimensional movement.

:formula_1

Where formula_2 is the angular acceleration of the pendulum, formula_3 is the standard gravity on the surface of the Earth, formula_4 is the length of the pendulum, and formula_5 is the angular displacement measured from the equilibrium position.

When formula_2 added to both sides, it has the same sign as the angular acceleration term:

:formula_7

Thus, the inverted pendulum accelerates away from the vertical unstable equilibrium in the direction initially displaced, and the acceleration is inversely proportional to the length. Tall pendulums fall more slowly than short ones.

Derivation using torque and moment of inertia:
The pendulum is assumed to consist of a point mass, of mass formula_8, affixed to the end of a massless rigid rod, of length formula_4, attached to a pivot point at the end opposite the point mass.

The net torque of the system must equal the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration:
:formula_10
The torque due to gravity providing the net torque:
:formula_11
Where formula_12 is the angle measured from the inverted equilibrium position.

The resulting equation:
:formula_13

The moment of inertia for a point mass:
:formula_14
In the case of the inverted pendulum the radius is the length of the rod, formula_15.

Substituting in formula_16
:formula_17

Mass and formula_18 is divided from each side resulting in:
:formula_7

===Inverted pendulum on a cart===
An inverted pendulum on a cart consists of a mass formula_20 at the top of a pole of length formula_15 pivoted on a horizontally moving base as shown in the adjacent image. The cart is restricted to linear motion and is subject to forces resulting in or hindering motion.

===Essentials of stabilization===
The essentials of stabilizing the inverted pendulum can be summarized qualitatively in three steps.
1. If the tilt angle formula_22 is to the right, the cart must accelerate to the right and vice versa.

2. The position of the cart formula_23 relative to track center is stabilized by slightly modulating the null angle (the angle error that the control system tries to null) by the position of the cart, that is, null angle formula_24 where formula_25 is small. This makes the pole want to lean slightly toward track center and stabilize at track center where the tilt angle is exactly vertical. Any offset in the tilt sensor or track slope that would otherwise cause instability translates into a stable position offset. A further added offset gives position control.

3. A normal pendulum subject to a moving pivot point such as a load lifted by a crane, has a peaked response at the pendulum radian frequency of formula_26. To prevent uncontrolled swinging, the frequency spectrum of the pivot motion should be suppressed near formula_27. The inverted pendulum requires the same suppression filter to achieve stability.

As a consequence of the null angle modulation strategy, the position feedback is positive, that is, a sudden command to move right produces an initial cart motion to the left followed by a move right to rebalance the pendulum. The interaction of the pendulum instability and the positive position feedback instability to produce a stable system is a feature that makes the mathematical analysis an interesting and challenging problem.

=== From Lagrange&#x27;s equations ===
The equations of motion can be derived using Lagrange&#x27;s equations. We refer to the drawing to the right where formula_28 is the angle of the pendulum of length formula_29 with respect to the vertical direction and the acting forces are gravity and an external force &quot;F&quot; in the x-direction. Define formula_30 to be the position of the cart.

The kinetic energy formula_31 of the system is:

:formula_32

where formula_33 is the velocity of the cart and formula_34 is the velocity of the point mass formula_35.
formula_33 and formula_34 can be expressed in terms of x and formula_5 by writing the velocity as the first derivative of the position;
:formula_39
:formula_40
Simplifying the expression for formula_34 leads to:
:formula_42

The kinetic energy is now given by:
:formula_43

The generalized coordinates of the system are formula_5 and formula_45, each has a generalized force.
On the formula_45 axis, the generalized force formula_47 can be calculated through its virtual work

:formula_48

on the formula_5 axis, the generalized force formula_50 can be also calculated through its virtual work

:formula_51

According to the Lagrange&#x27;s equations, the equations of motion are:
:formula_52
:formula_53
substituting formula_31 in these equations and simplifying leads to the equations that describe the motion of the inverted pendulum:

:formula_55

:formula_56

These equations are nonlinear, but since the goal of a control system would be to keep the pendulum upright, the equations can be linearized around formula_57.

=== From Euler-Lagrange equations ===

The generalized forces can be both written as potential energy formula_58 and formula_59,

According to the D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s principle, generalized forces and potential energy are connected:

:formula_60

However, under certain circumstances, the potential energy is not accessible, only generalized forces are available.

After getting the Lagrangian formula_61, we can also use Euler–Lagrange equation to solve for equations of motion:

:formula_62,
:formula_63.

The only difference is whether to incorporate the generalized forces into the potential energy formula_64 or write them explicitly as formula_65 on the right side, they all lead to the same equations in the final.

=== From Newton&#x27;s second law===

Oftentimes it is beneficial to use Newton&#x27;s second law instead of Lagrange&#x27;s equations because Newton&#x27;s equations give the reaction forces at the joint between the pendulum and the cart. These equations give rise to two equations for each body; one in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. The equations of motion of the cart are shown below where the LHS is the sum of the forces on the body and the RHS is the acceleration.

:formula_66
:formula_67

In the equations above formula_68 and formula_69 are reaction forces at the joint. formula_70 is the normal force applied to the cart. This second equation depends only on the vertical reaction force, thus the equation can be used to solve for the normal force. The first equation can be used to solve for the horizontal reaction force. In order to complete the equations of motion, the acceleration of the point mass attached to the pendulum must be computed. The position of the point mass can be given in inertial coordinates as

:formula_71

Taking two derivatives yields the acceleration vector in the inertial reference frame.

:formula_72

Then, using Newton&#x27;s second law, two equations can be written in the x-direction and the y-direction. Note that the reaction forces are positive as applied to the pendulum and negative when applied to the cart. This is due to Newton&#x27;s Third Law.

:formula_73
:formula_74

The first equation allows yet another way to compute the horizontal reaction force in the event the applied force formula_75 is not known. The second equation can be used to solve for the vertical reaction force. The first equation of motion is derived by substituting formula_76 into formula_77, which yields

:formula_78

By inspection this equation is identical to the result from Lagrange&#x27;s Method. In order to obtain the second equation, the pendulum equation of motion must be dotted with a unit vector that runs perpendicular to the pendulum at all times and is typically noted as the x-coordinate of the body frame. In inertial coordinates this vector can be written using a simple 2-D coordinate transformation

:formula_79

The pendulum equation of motion written in vector form is formula_80. Dotting formula_81 with both sides yields the following on the LHS (note that a transpose is the same as a dot product)

:formula_82

In the above equation the relationship between body frame components of the reaction forces and inertial frame components of reaction forces is used. The assumption that the bar connecting the point mass to the cart is massless implies that this bar cannot transfer any load perpendicular to the bar. Thus, the inertial frame components of the reaction forces can be written simply as formula_83, which signifies that the bar can transfer loads only along the axis of the bar itself. This gives rise to another equation that can be used to solve for the tension in the rod itself:

:formula_84

The RHS of the equation is computed similarly by dotting formula_81 with the acceleration of the pendulum. The result (after some simplification) is shown below.

:formula_86

Combining the LHS with the RHS and dividing through by m yields

:formula_87

which again is identical to the result of Lagrange&#x27;s method. The benefit of using Newton&#x27;s method is that all reaction forces are revealed to ensure that nothing is damaged. 

For a derivation of the equations of motions from Newton&#x27;s second law, as above, using the Symbolic Math Toolbox and references therein.

==Variants==
Achieving stability of an inverted pendulum has become a common engineering challenge for researchers. There are different variations of the inverted pendulum on a cart ranging from a rod on a cart to a multiple segmented inverted pendulum on a cart. Another variation places the inverted pendulum&#x27;s rod or segmented rod on the end of a rotating assembly. In both, (the cart and rotating system) the inverted pendulum can fall only in a plane. The inverted pendulums in these projects can either be required to maintain balance only after an equilibrium position is achieved, or can achieve equilibrium by itself. Another platform is a two-wheeled balancing inverted pendulum. The two wheeled platform has the ability to spin on the spot offering a great deal of maneuverability. Yet another variation balances on a single point. A spinning top, a unicycle, or an inverted pendulum atop a spherical ball all balance on a single point.

===Kapitza&#x27;s pendulum===
An inverted pendulum in which the pivot is oscillated rapidly up and down can be stable in the inverted position. This is called Kapitza&#x27;s pendulum, after Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitza who first analysed it. The equation of motion for a pendulum connected to a massless, oscillating base is derived the same way as with the pendulum on the cart. The position of the point mass is now given by:
:formula_88
and the velocity is found by taking the first derivative of the position:
:formula_89

The Lagrangian for this system can be written as:
:formula_90
and the equation of motion follows from:
:formula_91
resulting in:
:formula_92
If &quot;y&quot; represents a simple harmonic motion, formula_93, the following differential equation is:
:formula_94

This equation does not have elementary closed-form solutions, but can be explored in a variety of ways. It is closely approximated by the Mathieu equation, for instance, when the amplitude of oscillations are small. Analyses show that the pendulum stays upright for fast oscillations. The first plot shows that when formula_95 is a slow oscillation, the pendulum quickly falls over when disturbed from the upright position. The angle formula_5 exceeds 90° after a short time, which means the pendulum has fallen on the ground. If formula_95 is a fast oscillation the pendulum can be kept stable around the vertical position. The second plot shows that when disturbed from the vertical position, the pendulum now starts an oscillation around the vertical position (formula_98). The deviation from the vertical position stays small, and the pendulum doesn&#x27;t fall over.
==Examples==
Arguably the most prevalent example of a stabilized inverted pendulum is a human being. A person standing upright acts as an inverted pendulum with their feet as the pivot, and without constant small muscular adjustments would fall over. The human nervous system contains an unconscious feedback control system, the sense of balance or righting reflex, that uses proprioceptive input from the eyes, muscles and joints, and orientation input from the vestibular system consisting of the three semicircular canals in the inner ear, and two otolith organs, to make continual small adjustments to the skeletal muscles to keep us standing upright. Walking, running, or balancing on one leg puts additional demands on this system. Certain diseases and alcohol or drug intoxication can interfere with this reflex, causing dizziness and disequilibration, an inability to stand upright. A field sobriety test used by police to test drivers for the influence of alcohol or drugs, tests this reflex for impairment.

Some simple examples include balancing brooms or meter sticks by hand. 
The inverted pendulum has been employed in various devices and trying to balance an inverted pendulum presents a unique engineering problem for researchers. The inverted pendulum was a central component in the design of several early seismometers due to its inherent instability resulting in a measurable response to any disturbance.

The inverted pendulum model has been used in some recent personal transporters, such as the two-wheeled self-balancing scooters and single-wheeled electric unicycles. These devices are kinematically unstable and use an electronic feedback servo system to keep them upright.

Swinging a pendulum on a cart into its inverted pendulum state is considered a traditional optimal control toy problem/benchmark.

<doc id="265422" wikidata="Q199801" url="?curid=265422" title="Cindy Crawford">
<text>Cynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model. During the 1980s and 1990s, she was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers and runways, as well as fashion campaigns. She subsequently expanded into acting and business ventures.

==Early life==
Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966, the daughter of Daniel Kenneth Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (née Walker). She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle, and a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.

On social media, she stated that her family had been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry was mostly German, English and French. She is a descendant of English Puritan settler Thomas Trowbridge, who helped establish the Congregational Church in New Haven. She was raised in the Congregationalist faith and found it &quot;incredible&quot; that religious values &quot;trickled down&quot; to her family. According to official census records, Crawford&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather David Crawford was of Scottish ancestry from Northern Ireland who settled in Wisconsin. Appearing in an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included European nobility and that she was descended from Charlemagne.

In her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modeling work, only to discover it was a prank by two of her classmates. However, the following year, another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week&#x27;s coed in the &quot;DeKalb Nite Weekly&quot;, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford&#x27;s first cover. The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. Initially, she worked with a small agency, which was sold to Elite Model Management shortly after she signed. In 1983, she entered Elite&#x27;s Look of the Year contest at 17 and made the national finals.

Crawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian. She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one quarter before dropping out to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, she moved to New York City in 1986 and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.

==Career==
In 1987, Crawford appeared in the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;. Three years later, she was featured alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of &quot;British Vogue&quot;. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael&#x27;s hit &quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot; later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of &quot;Please Come Home For Christmas&quot;, &quot;John Taylor&quot; in the 2011 video for Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Girl Panic&quot; (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift&#x27;s &quot;Bad Blood&quot; as part of a cast including Jessica Alba, Selena Gomez, and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss.
She was frequently featured on the cover of multiple fashion and lifestyle magazines, including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and &quot;Allure&quot;. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances. Crawford has walked the runway shows for Chanel, Versace, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Roberto Cavalli, Michael Kors, Thierry Mugler, Todd Oldham, DKNY and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Hervé Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy&#x27;s).

In July 1988, she posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts. In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of &quot;Playboy&quot; for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts. She was ranked number 5 on &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 &quot;Shape&quot; magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by &quot;People&quot; magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine. She was named No. 3 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s&quot; and was named one of the &quot;100 Hottest Women of All-Time&quot; by &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot;.

The red Versace dress she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced. In 1992, Crawford—through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions—made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named &quot;Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body&quot;; although criticised by some for being unsafe, it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, &quot;Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge&quot; in 1993 (again with Radu) and &quot;Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension&quot; in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, &quot;Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits&quot;, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.

The inaugural issue of &quot;George&quot;, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years.

Crawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host and executive producer of MTV&#x27;s &quot;House of Style&quot;. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising. In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi&#x27;s Super Bowl commercial, aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford. In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie &quot;Fair Game&quot;. Her performance was panned by critics—Leonard Maltin commented &quot;In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.&quot; The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in &quot;The Simian Line&quot;. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford&#x27;s acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy &quot;Body Guards – Guardie del corpo&quot;. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line.

In the late 1990s, she made a number of appearances in magician David Copperfield&#x27;s stage shows, standing in for her fellow supermodel Claudia Schiffer as Copperfield&#x27;s guest assistant. During these appearances, she took part in a number of different illusions including being levitated, guillotined, and sawn in half in Copperfield&#x27;s Clearly Impossible illusion. On a number of occasions, she joined Copperfield and Schiffer in a performance of the Double Sawing illusion in which both women were sawn in half and then reassembled with their lower halves swapped.

===After modeling===
Crawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker. Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 29.

In 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the &quot;Cindy Crawford Home Collection&quot; name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes. She also has a furniture line with Rooms to Go, Raymour &amp; Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009.
In 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book &quot;Room 23&quot;, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication. &quot;Becoming&quot;, a book about Crawford&#x27;s life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O&#x27;Leary, was published in September 2015.

Crawford appeared on the US version of Lipsync Battle reenacting her performance in the bathtub from the George Michael music for &quot;Freedom! &#x27;90&quot;, performed by actor Zachary Quinto.

Crawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of &quot;Vogue&quot; Paris. In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy. In September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.

In January 2019, Crawford, along with her husband Rande Gerber, Michael Meldman, Jeff Shell and Jay Sures announced they would purchase the Hollywood deli Nate &#x27;n Al to keep its doors open after three generations of family ownership.

Crawford was featured in an upcoming four-part Apple TV+ docuseries titled &quot;The Super Models&quot;, which premiered on September 20, 2023. The series also featured Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista and was directed by Roger Ross Williams and Larissa Bills.

==Personal life==
Crawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 until their divorce in 1995. She married businessman and former model Rande Gerber on May 29, 1998. They have two children, son Presley Walker Gerber (born July 2, 1999) and daughter Kaia Jordan Gerber (born September 3, 2001),

In August 2021, the couple sold their home in Trousdale Estates, Beverly Hills, for a reported $13.5 million.

=== Style and appearance ===
Crawford is tall with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34–25.5–36. Her trademark is a mole (or &quot;beauty mark&quot;) above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she &quot;licked off&quot; her own mole. Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as &quot;Baby Gia&quot;.

==Advocacy and charity work==
When Crawford was 10 years old, her three-year-old brother Jeff—whom she continues to praise as &quot;the fourth most influential person in [her] life&quot;—died of leukemia. Since becoming a model, Crawford has made childhood leukemia a focal point of her charity work, donating proceeds of her calendars to medical research. Crawford has been a long-time supporter of the pediatric oncology program at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where Jeff was treated, stating that she believes he received the best care possible. She is also an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.

In 2007, she became an official supporter of the Ronald McDonald House Charities and is a member of their celebrity board, called the Friends of RMHC. Crawford is on the honorary committee of the California Wildlife Center.

In 2021, Cindy Crawford recreated her iconic Pepsi ad with photographer David Yarrow to help raise funds for the American family Children&#x27;s Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin where her brother, Jeff, was treated for leukemia.

===Political endorsements===
In 2008, Crawford endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States. Despite reports, Crawford denied endorsing Mitt Romney for the 2012 election.

<doc id="265431" wikidata="Q2431756" url="?curid=265431" title="Tidal resonance">
<text>In oceanography, a tidal resonance occurs when the tide excites one of the resonant modes of the ocean. 
The effect is most striking when a continental shelf is about a quarter wavelength wide. Then an incident tidal wave can be reinforced by reflections between the coast and the shelf edge, the result producing a much higher tidal range at the coast.

Famous examples of this effect are found in the Bay of Fundy, where the world&#x27;s highest tides are reportedly found, and in the Bristol Channel. Less well known is Leaf Bay, part of Ungava Bay near the entrance of Hudson Strait (Canada), which has tides similar to those of the Bay of Fundy. Other resonant regions with large tides include the Patagonian Shelf and on the continental shelf of northwest Australia.

Most of the resonant regions are also responsible for large fractions of the total amount of tidal energy dissipated in the oceans. Satellite altimeter data shows that the M2 tide dissipates approximately 2.5 TW, of which 261 GW is lost in the Hudson Bay complex, 208 GW on the European Shelves (including the Bristol Channel), 158 GW on the North-west Australian Shelf, 149 GW in the Yellow Sea and 112 GW on the Patagonian Shelf.

==Scale of the resonances==
The speed of long waves in the ocean is given, to a good approximation, by formula_1, where &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration of gravity and &quot;h&quot; is the depth of the ocean.
For a typical continental shelf with a depth of 100 m, the speed is approximately 30 m/s. So if the tidal period is 12 hours, a quarter wavelength shelf will have a width of about 300 km.

With a narrower shelf, there is still a resonance but it is mismatched to the frequency of the tides and so has less effect on tidal amplitudes. However the effect is still enough to partly explain why tides along a coast lying behind a continental shelf are often higher than at offshore islands in the deep ocean (one of the additional partial explanations being Green&#x27;s law). Resonances also generate strong tidal currents and it is the turbulence caused by the currents which is responsible for the large amount of tidal energy dissipated in such regions.

In the deep ocean, where the depth is typically 4000 m, the speed of long waves increases to approximately 200 m/s. The difference in speed, when compared to the shelf, is responsible for reflections at the continental shelf edge. Away from resonance this can reduce tidal energy moving onto the shelf. However near a resonant frequency the phase relationship, between the waves on the shelf and in the deep ocean, can have the effect of drawing energy onto the shelf.

The increased speed of long waves in the deep ocean means that the tidal wavelength there is of order 10,000 km. As the ocean basins have a similar size, they also have the potential of being resonant. 
In practice deep ocean resonances are difficult to observe, probably because the deep ocean loses tidal energy too rapidly to the resonant shelves.

<doc id="265432" wikidata="Q1187704" url="?curid=265432" title="Lake monster">
<text>A lake monster is a lake-dwelling creature in myth and folklore. The most famous example is the Loch Ness Monster. Depictions of lake monsters are often similar to those of sea monsters.

In the &quot;Motif-Index of Folk-Literature&quot;, entities classified as &quot;lake monsters&quot;, such as the Scottish Loch Ness Monster, the American Chessie, and the Swedish Storsjöodjuret fall under B11.3.1.1. (&quot;dragon lives in lake&quot;).

==Theories==
According to the Swedish naturalist and author Bengt Sjögren (1980), present-day lake monsters are variations of older legends of water kelpies. Sjögren claims that the accounts of lake-monsters have changed during history, as do others. Older reports often talk about horse-like appearances, but more modern reports often have more reptile and dinosaur-like appearances; he concludes that the legendary kelpies have evolved into the present day saurian lake-monsters since the discovery of dinosaurs and giant aquatic reptiles and the popularization of them in both scientific and fictional writings and art.

The stories cut across cultures, existing in some variation in many countries. and have undergone what Michel Meurger calls concretizing (The process of turning items, drawings, general beliefs and stories into a plausible whole) and naturalization over time as humanity&#x27;s view of the world has changed.

In many of these areas, especially around Loch Ness, Lake Champlain and the Okanagan Valley, these lake monsters have become important tourist draws.

In Ben Radford and Joe Nickell&#x27;s book &quot;Lake Monster Mysteries&quot;, the authors attribute a vast number of sightings to otter misidentifications. Ed Grabianowski plotted the distribution of North American lake monster sightings and then overlaid this with the distribution of the common otter and found a near perfect match. It turns out that three or four otters swimming in a line look remarkably like a serpentine, humped creature undulating through the water, very easy to mistake for a single creature if you see them from a distance. &quot;This isn&#x27;t speculation. I&#x27;m not making this up,&quot; Nickell said. &quot;I&#x27;ve spoken to people who saw what they thought was a lake monster, got closer and discovered it was actually a line of otters. That really happens.&quot; Of course, not every supposed lake monster sighting can be attributed to otters, but it is an excellent example of how our perceptions can be fooled.

Paul Barrett and Darren Naish note that the existence of any large animals in isolation (i.e., in a situation where no breeding population exists) is highly unlikely. Naish also observes that the stories are likely remnants of tales meant to keep children safely away from the water.

There have been many purported sightings of lake monsters, and even some photographs, but each time these have either been shown to be deliberate deceptions, such as the Lake George Monster Hoax, or serious doubts about the veracity and verifiability have arisen, as with the famous Mansi photograph of Champ.

The most recent lake monster sighting to get widespread attention occurred during post-production of the Champ movie &quot;Lucy and the Lake Monster&quot;. The filmmakers reviewed their drone footage from production on August 2, 2024, and noticed what appears to be a large creature swimming just below the surface of the water, in Bulwagga Bay. The alleged plesiosaur image is visible in the bottom right portion of the screen, swimming behind a boat containing the two lead actors in the film. The boat was 142 inches from the tip of the bow to the stern and 50.5 inches at the widest point and the alleged plesiosaur appears bigger than the boat. One of the co-writers, Kelly Tabor, believes it to be a foundational piece of evidence for Champ. The second co-writer, Richard Rossi, referred to himself as the &quot;Doubting Thomas,&quot; and he shared the entire five minutes of footage with a conclave of scientists with earned doctorates in science for further study of the Tabor-Rossi footage.

<text>Otto Georg Schily (born 20 July 1932) is a former Federal Minister of the Interior of Germany, his tenure was from 1998 to 2005, in the cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

==Early life and education==
Born in Bochum as the son of an iron works director, Schily grew up in a family of anthroposophists. His younger brother is Konrad Schily, an academic and also a politician. They spent their adolescence during the war in Bavaria. The family opposed Adolf Hitler. In 1962, he passed his second state exam after having studied law and politics in Munich, Hamburg, and Berlin, thus being admitted to the bar; a year later, he opened his own law practice.

On 2 June 1967 Schily went to a demonstration in Berlin against the violation of human rights in Iran. A student, Benno Ohnesorg, was shot dead by the police. He subsequently decided to represent the student&#x27;s family.

In the 1970s, he became a public figure as a trial lawyer, defending several guerrilla activists of the left-wing Red Army Faction. In 1971, he represented his friend Horst Mahler, who much later would become an advocate of the fascist National Democratic Party. During the Stammheim trial (1975–1977), he was the only remaining attorney of Gudrun Ensslin. While he gained popularity and respect for acting according to his own moral principles, some accused him of supporting the radicals&#x27; goals.

==Political career==

===Founding member of the Green Party===

In 1980, Schily became founding member of the Green Party. In 1982, he joined other members of the Green Party for a meeting with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who offered to help groups allied with the European anti-nuclear movement to try to close United States military bases in Europe.

In the 1983 elections, Schily was elected to the German Bundestag and in the first electoral term in which the Greens were represented in parliament, he was one of the spokespersons of the parliamentary group, together with Petra Kelly and Marieluise Beck. In parliament, he became a leading exponent of the party&#x27;s &quot;realist&quot; wing, which favored striving for a governing coalition with the Social Democrats following the 1987 elections. In 1986, he was the Greens&#x27; sole representative on a Bundestag committee investigating the so-called Flick affair. Due to the party&#x27;s policy of rotating its representatives, he had to leave parliament in 1986, but he was re-elected in 1987.

===Switch to the Social Democrats===
Increasingly estranged from the fundamentalist wing of the Greens, particularly regarding alliances with larger parties, Schily left the party in 1989, resigned his seat in parliament, and joined the Social Democrats (SPD) instead – which he represented in the new &quot;Bundestag&quot; in 1990. In subsequent years, he was active in affairs of the former East Germany and in coordinating various legal policies of the SPD. Between 1994 and 1998, Schily served on the Committee on the Election of Judges (&quot;Wahlausschuss&quot;), which is in charge of appointing judges to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. He was also a member of the parliamentary body in charge of appointing judges to the Highest Courts of Justice, namely the Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG), the Federal Fiscal Court (BFH), the Federal Labour Court (BAG), and the Federal Social Court (BSG).

===Federal Minister of the Interior, 1998–2005===
After Gerhard Schröder became chancellor in 1998, he appointed Schily as Federal Minister of the Interior. He was the oldest member of the cabinet.

During his time in office, Schily was frequently criticized for conservative policies, such as pushing through German anti-terrorist legislation after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, which were seen as contradictory to his earlier beliefs. Under the new legislation, his ministry moved against Metin Kaplan’s radical Islamic group in December 2001, banning it and 19 associated organizations and carrying out more than 200 raids in seven cities.

Between 2001 and 2004, Schily led the government’s negotiations with the conservative opposition on a bill that made it easier for skilled workers to move to Germany but toughened controls on foreign militants. In 2004, he joined Italy in proposing the creation of the camps, possibly in Libya, to process potential immigrants and repatriate illegal arrivals to the EU.

In 2001, the parliamentary opposition called for Schily’s resignation in light of revelations that his ministry had failed to inform the Federal Constitutional Court that a key witness in the government’s petition to ban the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) had worked as an undercover agent for the domestic intelligence service; the failure to notify the court later resulted in the suspension of the proceedings.

In 2005, Schily again came under pressure for authorizing a raid on the newsroom of &quot;Cicero&quot; magazine after it had published information from a secret Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) report.

On 29 March 2007, Schily took responsibility for the handling of the case of Guantanamo detainee Murat Kurnaz, who was arrested in Pakistan in 2001, turned over to United States authorities and held at the U.S. prison camp in Cuba as a terror suspect. Kurnaz was released in 2006 and returned to Germany.

Following the 2005 elections and the formation of the new government of Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, Schily was succeeded in his post by Wolfgang Schäuble. Schily remained a member of parliament until 2009 and served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 2008, he caused headlines when the German Bundestag on 22 April fined him €22,000 for failing to disclose the names of his law firm’s clients. Otto Schily opposed compulsory vaccination as unconstitutional in an article in Die Welt.

==Life after politics==
After serving as a minister, Schily became a supervisory board member of two companies for biometric technologies, raising questions as to whether or not he was capitalizing on his work as minister, regarding the implementation of biometric passports.

Between 2006 and 2007, Schily served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters.

In 2015, Schily was accused of receiving money to lobby for the prosecution in Austria of Rakhat Aliyev, a former Kazakh official who turned against the Kazakh government.

In addition, Schily has held various paid and unpaid positions, including the following:
* Deloitte Germany, Member of the Advisory Board 
* Schengen White List Project, Member of the Advisory Board
* Hertha BSC Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Investcorp, Member of the European Advisory Board (since 2006)
* Ziegert Bank- und Immobilienconsulting, Member of the Advisory Board
* DAPD News Agency, Member of the Advisory Board (2011-2012) 
* 2006 FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee, Member of the Supervisory Board (2005-2006)

==Recognition==
In 2005, Schily received the Leo Baeck Medal for his humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice.

<doc id="265444" wikidata="Q4038212" url="?curid=265444" title="Escape Velocity Nova">
<text>Escape Velocity Nova (a.k.a. EV Nova or EVN) is a video game developed by Ambrosia Software in collaboration with ATMOS. It is the third game in the &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; series of space trading and combat games. It was released on March 19, 2002 for Mac OS X and Mac OS 9, and later ported to Windows and released on July 11, 2003. The game&#x27;s premise, set in a time period after mankind has discovered hyperspace technology, grants the player freedom to take missions, trade goods, steal from other ships, and enter one of six storylines.

Originally a plug-in for &quot;Escape Velocity Override&quot; created by ATMOS, &quot;Nova&quot; development began with Ambrosia contracting ATMOS to make the plug-in the scenario for a new game. ATMOS developed the scenario and graphics, while Matt Burch developed the game engine. The game features six different mutually exclusive plot lines, but players have control to act as they will from the start of the game. Reception to the game praised the gameplay, plot, and ability to be replayed, but was critical of the lack of a soundtrack, repetitiveness, and pace and difficulty of the storylines.

==Gameplay and plot==

In &quot;Escape Velocity Nova&quot;, the player is placed in command of a shuttlecraft in space. The game is played from a top-down perspective in 2D. A tutorial is offered, but players are granted freedom to act as they will at the start. Players can earn money by purchasing and trading goods, taking missions transporting people or goods to various locations, or by stealing from other ships. The player&#x27;s ship moves between systems of planets by using a hyperspace jump. At various planets, the player can take on missions and trade goods, buy new ships, or outfit their current ship with new weapons and accessories. Ship classes vary from shuttlecraft to large frigates. There are six different storylines within the game that can be played; each one is mutually exclusive and a new game must be begun to play a different story. A player&#x27;s choices in the plot can impact the political alignment of the entire map. If players become strong enough, they can demand tribute from a system. Doing so will cause the system to deploy its fleet of ships, but should the player defeat the fleet, the system recognizes the player as its warlord and pays tribute.

&quot;Escape Velocity Nova&quot; is a shareware game. Its status is enforced in game by a character named Captain Hector, who will continuously remind the player to pay their shareware fee. The game also supports plug-ins, allowing players to create their own ships and campaigns, but access to do so is disallowed if the shareware fee is not paid.

Set in the year 1177 N.C., &quot;Escape Velocity Nova&quot;&#x27;s plot begins long after mankind has begun to explore outer space. Years before, a person named Omata Kane designed a &quot;hypergate&quot; system connecting systems of human-inhabited worlds that had been discovered by colonists from Earth. Terrorists destroyed the hypergate in the Sol system, which damaged the entire network. With this isolation, warlords arose and fell in the various disconnected systems. The later invention of hyperspace technology allowed for the lost systems to be reconnected, and resulted in order. Centered around Earth and the Sol system is the Federation, while to the south is the Auroran Empire, categorized as &quot;a savage race&quot;. Another group, called the Polaris, hold the east, while the north and west are unexplored territory. The player, having just purchased a shuttle, is cast out to begin a life as the captain of their own ship.

==Development==
&quot;Nova&quot; began as a plug-in for Ambrosia Software&#x27;s &quot;Escape Velocity Override&quot; in July 1998. A group of students from Tasmania: Dafydd Williams, Jason Cook, and Scott Vardy were fans of &quot;Override&quot; and began working on a modding project called &quot;Override Nova&quot;. Their updates on the project were shared on Ambrosia Software&#x27;s website forums, which caught the attention of Ambrosia employee Andrew Welch. Shortly afterward, the student group took the name ATMOS Software and signed a contract with Ambrosia to work on a new game. Ambrosia Software&#x27;s Matt Burch developed the game engine, while Welch managed the project and ATMOS developed the graphics and scenario. Burch, who had programmed &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; and &quot;Override&quot;, programmed &quot;Nova&quot; while also working a second job as an engineer. In July 2000, Ambrosia contracted ATMOS to convert the plug-in into the scenario for &quot;Nova&quot;. Development of the game from &quot;Override&quot; took approximately 12 months, with an additional 8 months of beta testing. &quot;Escape Velocity Nova&quot; was released on March 19, 2002 for Mac, and received both OS X and OS 9 releases. Later that year was announced to be receiving a Windows port, which was released on July 11, 2003. A 2008 update for Mac was built as a universal binary with native support for Intel processors.

== Reception ==

&quot;Escape Velocity Nova&quot; received praise for its gameplay and game design, especially in light of it being a shareware game. &quot;MacAddict&quot; gave &quot;Escape Velocity Nova&quot; its Editor&#x27;s Choice Award. Reviewer Chris Barylick stated that the gameplay is essentially the same as its predecessors, &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; and &quot;Override&quot;. He called the game &quot;more beautifully designed than you could expect a shareware game to be&quot;. Two years after the game&#x27;s release, Barylick said the game was still worth the download. In a review for &quot;Inside Mac Games&quot;, Richard Porcher expressed that &quot;Nova&quot;&#x27;s graphics were superior for a shareware game. &quot;Macworld&quot;″s Peter Cohen lauded the combination of action-based space battles with adventure-style gaming. He noted the game made improvements over &quot;Nova&quot;&#x27;s predecessors while stating that Ambrosia Software &quot;has wisely left alone what ain&#x27;t broken.&quot;

The game&#x27;s story and game length received more mixed reviews. Porcher stated that &quot;Nova&quot;&#x27;s strongest point is its ability to be replayed repeatedly, especially with support for plug-ins in the game. He also pointed out flaws with the storylines being too easy and the plot lines being mutually exclusive, but felt all would be addressed with plug-ins. &quot;PC Gamer&quot;&#x27;s J.T. Trollman gave praise for the game&#x27;s story writing but was critical of the game&#x27;s lengthy repetition and time span between points in the story. NomaD of Russian website &quot;Absolute Games&quot; praised the game&#x27;s large map and scenario, while also critical of the game&#x27;s lack of a soundtrack. By contrast, &quot;MacNN&quot; was critical of the small universe size and dialogue, though it called the game &quot;extraordinary&quot; and praised the game&#x27;s replayability.

<text>Detroit Dam is a gravity dam on the North Santiam River between Linn County and Marion County, Oregon. It is located in the Cascades, about west of the city of Detroit. It was constructed between 1949 and 1953 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The dam created deep Detroit Lake, more than 9 miles (14 km) long with 32 miles (51 km) of shoreline.

It is one of the dams authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938. Construction was delayed largely due to World War II. The dam, dedicated on June 10, 1953, was authorized for the purposes of flood control, power generation, navigation, and irrigation. Other uses are fishery, water quality, and recreation. It was built in concert with the Big Cliff Dam downstream.

In 2021, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determined that this dam was at risk of failing in a large earthquake in the Cascadia subduction zone, which would result in a &quot;potentially catastrophic flood&quot;, which could potentially affect Oregon&#x27;s state capital, Salem, located downstream. For this reason, the level of the reservoir was lowered by five feet, to reduce the stress on the concrete structure.

<text>Comparative anatomy is the study of similarities and differences in the anatomy of different species. It is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny (the evolution of species).

The science began in the classical era, continuing in the early modern period with work by Pierre Belon who noted the similarities of the skeletons of birds and humans.

Comparative anatomy has provided evidence of common descent, and has assisted in the classification of animals.

== History ==
The first specifically anatomical investigation separate from a surgical or medical procedure is associated by Alcmaeon of Croton. Leonardo da Vinci made notes for a planned anatomical treatise in which he intended to compare the hands of various animals including bears. Pierre Belon, a French naturalist born in 1517, conducted research and held discussions on dolphin embryos as well as the comparisons between the skeletons of birds to the skeletons of humans. His research led to modern comparative anatomy.

Around the same time, Andreas Vesalius was also making some strides of his own. A young anatomist of Flemish descent made famous by a penchant for amazing charts, he was systematically investigating and correcting the anatomical knowledge of the Greek physician Galen. He noticed that many of Galen&#x27;s observations were not even based on actual humans. Instead, they were based on other animals such as non-human apes, monkeys, and oxen. In fact, he entreated his students to do the following, in substitution for human skeletons, as cited by Edward Tyson : &quot;If you can&#x27;t happen to see any of these, dissect an Ape, carefully view each Bone, &amp;c. ...&quot; Then he advises what sort of Apes to make the choice of, as most resembling a Man : And conclude &quot;One ought to know the Structure of all the Bones either in a Humane Body or in an Apes ; &#x27;tis best in both ; and then to go to the Anatomy of the Muscles.&quot; Up until that point, Galen and his teachings had been the authority on human anatomy. The irony is that Galen himself had emphasized the fact that one should make one&#x27;s own observations instead of using those of another, but this advice was lost during the numerous translations of his work. As Vesalius began to uncover these mistakes, other physicians of the time began to trust their own observations more than those of Galen. An interesting observation made by some of these physicians was the presence of homologous structures in a wide variety of animals, even including humans. These observations were later used by Darwin as he formed his theory of Natural Selection.

Edward Tyson is regarded as the founder of modern comparative anatomy. He is credited with determining that whales and dolphins are, in fact, mammals. Also, he concluded that chimpanzees are more similar to humans than to monkeys because of their arms. Marco Aurelio Severino also compared various animals, including birds, in his &quot;Zootomia democritaea&quot;, one of the first works of comparative anatomy. In the 18th and 19th century, great anatomists like George Cuvier, Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley revolutionized our understanding of the basic build and systematics of vertebrates, laying the foundation for Charles Darwin&#x27;s work on evolution. An example of a 20th-century comparative anatomist is Victor Negus, who worked on the structure and evolution of the larynx. Until the advent of genetic techniques like DNA sequencing, comparative anatomy together with embryology were the primary tools for understanding phylogeny, as exemplified by the work of Alfred Romer.

==Concepts==
Two major concepts of comparative anatomy are:
# Homologous structures - structures (body parts/anatomy) which are similar in different species because the species have common descent and have evolved, usually divergently, from a shared ancestor. They may or may not perform the same function. An example is the forelimb structure shared by cats and whales.
# Analogous structures - structures similar in different organisms because, in convergent evolution, they evolved in a &quot;similar environment&quot;, rather than were inherited from a recent common ancestor. They usually serve the same or similar purposes. An example is the streamlined torpedo body shape of porpoises and sharks. So even though they evolved from different ancestors, porpoises and sharks developed analogous structures as a result of their evolution in the same aquatic environment. This is known as a homoplasy.

==Uses==
Comparative anatomy has long served as evidence for evolution, now joined in that role by comparative genomics; it indicates that organisms share a common ancestor.

It also assists scientists in classifying organisms based on similar characteristics of their anatomical structures. A common example of comparative anatomy is the similar bone structures in forelimbs of cats, whales, bats, and humans. All of these appendages consist of the same basic parts; yet, they serve completely different functions. The skeletal parts which form a structure used for swimming, such as a fin, would not be ideal for forming a wing, which is better suited for flight. One explanation for the forelimbs&#x27; similar composition is descent with modification. Through random mutations and natural selection, each organism&#x27;s anatomical structures gradually adapted to suit their respective habitats. The rules for development of &quot;special&quot; characteristics which differ significantly from general homology were listed by Karl Ernst von Baer as the laws now named after him.

<doc id="265448" wikidata="Q950514" url="?curid=265448" title="Pinot blanc">
<text>Pinot blanc () or Pinot bianco is a white wine grape. It is a point genetic mutation of Pinot noir. Pinot noir is genetically unstable and will occasionally experience a point mutation in which a vine bears all black fruit except for one cane which produces white fruit.

==Origins and regional production==

In Alsace, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia, the wine produced from this grape is a full-bodied white. In Germany, where it is known as Weißer Burgunder or Weißburgunder, there were of Pinot blanc in 2018. The most powerful versions are usually made in Baden and Palatinate. In 2018, there were of Pinot blanc in France, with most of the plantations found in Alsace, where it is used for both still white wines and is the most common variety used for sparkling wine, Crémant d&#x27;Alsace. Somewhat confusingly, the designation &quot;Pinot blanc&quot; for Alsace AOC wine does not necessarily mean that the wine is varietally pure Pinot blanc. (This is in difference to Pinot gris, which is a &quot;true&quot; varietal designation in Alsace.) Rather, the designation means that it is a white wine made from Pinot varieties. Under Alsace appellation rules, the varieties Pinot blanc, Auxerrois blanc, Pinot gris and Pinot noir (vinified white, without skin contact) may all be used, but a blend of Pinot blanc and Auxerrois blanc is the most common. The most full-bodied &quot;Pinot blanc&quot; wines from Alsace, with a spicy and smokey character and moderate acidity, are probably dominated by Auxerrois grapes. 

Historically, Pinot blanc was used both in Burgundy and Champagne. It is still allowed in Bourgogne blanc blend and small amounts of Pinot blanc may in principle be blended into some Burgundy wines, but very small amounts are cultivated in either region. In the Champagne region, Pinot blanc is often called Blanc Vrai.
In the United States it is mainly produced in California. In the United States, many of the vines called Pinot blanc are actually a different variety, Melon de Bourgogne/Muscadet, that resembles Chardonnay when on the vine. This mistake was discovered around the mid-1980s by a French oenologist who was examining rootstock while visiting University of California, Davis, and now Pinot blanc purchased from a nursery will be the genuine article. The grape is also grown in Austria and Hungary as well as in Burgundy, France. In Canada, Pinot blanc is often used to make ice wine. Canada&#x27;s Okanagan Valley has developed a reputation for Pinot blanc as its signature wine.

Pinot blanc has also been confused with Chardonnay, and wineries often vinify it in a similar style, using barrel fermentation, new oak and malolactic fermentation. It can also be treated more lightly and made into a crisper wine that still has some ability to age.

==Relationship to other grapes==
During a series of trials between 1930 and 1935, Pinot blanc was crossed with Riesling to create the white Italian wine grape variety Manzoni bianco.

==Wine characteristics==
In Alsace, Italy and Hungary, the wine produced from this grape is a full-bodied dry white wine while in Germany and Austria they can be either dry or sweet. One of the components of the wine Vin Santo can be Pinot blanc.
In France the grape is often blended with Klevner, sometimes referred to by locals as &quot;true Pinot&quot;, and Auxerrois grapes, in order to give it a more Alsatian flavor.

Bottles labeled Pinot blanc offer fruity aromas, often of apple, citrus fruit, and floral characteristics. Bottles that are varietally pure, although more difficult to find, provide stronger floral characteristics, stone fruits and a headier minerality. Regardless of their exact composition, most wines under the label &#x27;Pinot blanc&#x27; are rather high in acidity and are vinified in tank, though more prestigious examples are fermented in large, 100% used oak barrels. Pinot blanc wines are usually made for immediate consumption.

==Names in other regions==
Pinot blanc&#x27;s name varies by region. In Austria it may be bottled as Weissburgunder or Klevner. Weissburgunder is also used in the Südtirol/Alto Adige region of north east Italy (also occasionally named so in Alsace) and in Germany. Hungary calls it Fehér Burgundi. Spain and Italy refer to it as Pinot bianco. In the Czech Republic it is known as Rulandské Bílé, in Slovakia Rulandské Biele and in Croatia &quot;Pinot bijeli&quot; or &quot;Burgundac bijeli&quot;. In Serbia it is called &quot;Бели пино&quot;, &quot;Бели бургундац&quot;, &quot;Пино блан&quot;.

<text>This article provides an incomplete list and broad overview of significant religious sites and places of spiritual importance throughout the world. Sites are listed alphabetically by religion.

==Abrahamic religions==

Abrahamic religions are monotheistic faiths emphasizing and tracing their common origin to Abraham or recognizing a spiritual tradition identified with him. They constitute one of three major divisions in comparative religion, along with Indian religions (Dharmic) and East Asian religions (Taoic).

The three major Abrahamic faiths (in chronological order) are Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some strict definitions of what constitutes an Abrahamic religion include only these three faiths. However, there are many other religions incorporating Abrahamic doctrine, theology, genealogy and history into their own belief systems.

===Baháʼí Faith and Bábism===

The Baháʼí Faith is a monotheistic religion founded by Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in 19th century Persia, and consider their religion to progress from or succeed Bábism or the Bábi Faith ( ) founded by the Báb earlier in the century – emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind.


Located in Bahji, near Acre, Israel the Shrine of Baháʼu&#x27;lláh is the most holy place for Baháʼís and their &quot;Qiblih&quot;, or direction of prayer. It contains the remains of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and is near the spot where he died in the Mansion of Bahji. Baháʼís regard Acre (He.: עַכּוֹ ; Ar.: عكّا &quot;ʻAkkā&quot;) itself as their holy city, mostly due to the fact that it serves as the location of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and his family&#x27;s many affairs. Within Acre, Baháʼí sites include the House of &#x27;Abbúd, the House of &#x27;Abdu&#x27;lláh Páshá, the Garden of Ridván and the Prison cell of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh – where Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh was incarcerated.

The second holiest site in the Baháʼí Faith – which is also revered by the few remaining Azalis (post-Baháʼí–Azali split followers of Bábism, who number just several thousand worldwide) – is the Shrine of the Báb, located on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel. The Báb&#x27;s Shrine contains within its walls the temporary Shrine of ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá.

The BWC also contains the Monument Gardens – wherein can be found the graves of some of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s family – as well as a house in which &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá lived, and the resting place of Rúhíyyih Khánum (8 August 1910 – 19 January 2000; born Mary Sutherland Maxwell; the wife of Shoghi Effendi).

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh decreed pilgrimage in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas to two places: the House of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh in Baghdad, Iraq and the House of the Báb in Shiraz, Iran. While these major pilgrimages were later replaced (at least in terms of religious significance) by &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, many Baháʼís still flocked to Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s home for pilgrimage until the house was confiscated by Muslim authorities hostile to the Baháʼí Faith in 1922. It has yet to be returned to the Baháʼí community. The House of the Báb was completely destroyed by Iranian Muslims during a state-sponsored persecution of Baháʼís. A road and mosque were built over the house and a telephone pole now marks the spot where the Báb proclaimed his prophethood. The city of Baghdad also includes the Garden of Ridván, which shares the same name as – though is distinct from – the Garden of Ridván in Acre.

===Christianity===


Located in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, the Edicule, also known as the Tomb of Christ, within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is the most holy site for many mainstream denominations within Christianity. The area of the Church is regarded as the site, according to their understanding, where Jesus Christ suffered, was crucified, died, buried and resurrected from the dead along a temporal pathway known as the Via Dolorosa (from the Latin; lit. &quot;way of sorrows&quot;). The first eight Stations of the Cross can be followed along the route leading up to the Church, inside of which are the final five Stations.

The Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, Roman Catholic Church, and Armenian Apostolic Church form the custodians of the Holy Sepulchre and collectively control the most holy pilgrimages within the church along with the Coptic, Syriac, and Ethiopian Orthodox churches who also hold some chapels. Within the walls of the church are the many traditional locations for the events associated with the Passion and death of Jesus: The Stone of Unction (the anointing place of Christ&#x27;s body), the Prison of Christ (where Jesus was held, incarcerated, before his Passion), a treasure room which holds relics including fragments of the True Cross, and of course Calvary or Golgotha (where Christ was crucified) and the Sepulchre itself – to name a few.
Many Protestant and nontrinitarian denominations regard the nearby Garden Tomb to be the actual crucifixion and resurrection site of Jesus. Still others have claimed that Jesus&#x27;s tomb is in Japan, or is really located outside of East Jerusalem.
Other holy sites and shrines of pilgrimage exist in the Holy Land. In Jerusalem the Garden of Gethsemane, the Mount Zion Cenacle of the Last Supper and the Mount of Olives, as well as the Church of the Ascension prove spiritually important. Outside Jerusalem are pilgrimage places including the Sea of Galilee, as well as locations in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Capernaum:
* Bethlehem: The location of the Church of the Nativity in Manger Square, where Jesus was born.
* Capernaum: The town, bordering the Sea of Galilee, is cited in the Gospel of Luke where it was reported to have been the home of the apostles Simon Peter, Andrew, James and John, as well as the tax collector Matthew. In the Gospel of Matthew the town was reported to have been the home of Jesus. According to Luke, Jesus taught in the synagogue in Capernaum on Sabbath. Jesus then healed a man who had the spirit of an unclean devil and healed a fever in Simon Peter&#x27;s mother-in-law. According to Luke, it is also the place where a Roman Centurion asked Jesus to heal his servant. Capernaum is also mentioned in the Gospel of Mark, in which it is the location of the famous healing of the paralytic lowered through the roof to reach Jesus. According to several Gospels, Jesus selected this town as the center of his public ministry in the Galilee after he left the small mountainous hamlet of Nazareth. Capernaum has no obvious advantages over any other city in the area, so he probably chose it because it was the home of his first disciples, Simon (Peter) and Andrew.
* Nazareth: The location of the Church of the Annunciation (in the Catholic tradition marks the site where the Archangel Gabriel announced the future birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary ), St. Gabriel&#x27;s Church (an Orthodox alternative site for the Annunciation), the Synagogue Church (The Melkite Greek Catholic Church lays claim to this site, which is traditionally that of the synagogue where Jesus preached ), the Church of St. Joseph&#x27;s Carpentry (occupies the traditional location for the workshop of Saint Joseph); the Mensa Christi Church (run by the Franciscan religious order, commemorates the traditional location where Jesus dined with the Apostles after his Resurrection), the Basilica of Jesus the Adolescent (run by the Salesian religious order, occupies a hill overlooking the city), the Church of Christ (an Anglican church in Nazareth), and the Church of Our Lady of the Fright (marking the spot where Mary saw Jesus being taken to a cliff by the congregation of the synagogue and felt fear on his account). The &quot;Jesus Trail&quot; pilgrimage route connects many of the religious sites in Nazareth on a 60 km walking trail which ends in Capernaum.

Other important locations identified with the life of Jesus include areas around the Sea of Galilee – for instance Cana and the Church of the Multiplication in Tabgha – as well as the Mount of Temptation (in the Judean desert), Mount Tabor, Jacob&#x27;s Well, Bethany and Bethabara (on the Jordan River). The town of Sepphoris is where the Virgin Mary spent her childhood.

Still other revered places may exist within or outside the Holy Land, involving localities associated with the lives of the Twelve Apostles, the Church Fathers, the relatives and ancestors of Jesus, saints, or other figures or events featured in both the Old Testament (sharing religious significance with Judaism or other Abrahamic faiths) and New Testament. The reverence held for these sites may vary depending on denomination.


====Catholic Church====

Catholics, like many other Christians, regards the Sepulchre in Jerusalem to be the holiest of places. It also places emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum, and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since apostolic times, and notes as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the Apostles.

Mainstream Catholicism as a whole is represented by the Holy See (, &quot;holy chair&quot;) of the Vatican City state (Italian: ), a walled enclave within Rome, Italy. Inside the Vatican the largest church in history, St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (L.: ), is the location of the Papal office and the living quarters of the Pope (in the Apostolic Palace), as well as Vatican Hill – atop which are Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb and place of crucifixion, his throne, and his baldachin. Outside St. Peter&#x27;s Square are many more churches throughout the Vatican and outlying Rome. One important landmark is the Sistine Chapel (L.: ; I.: ), in which the Papal conclave takes place.

Rome is the place from which Catholics believe the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church was formally founded and begun by Saint Peter (whom they consider to be the &quot;Prince of the Apostles&quot;) as the appointed successor and first vicar of Christ. Thus while the Holy Sepulchre is still the most sanctified of places for Catholics, the Vatican is an extremely sacred place to the faithful (those of the Latin Church, as well as the Churches &quot;sui iuris&quot;) as the seat of their supreme authority on Earth. Important papal territories include the four major basilicas (L.: , pl. &quot;-es&quot;; excluding St. Peter&#x27;s) – namely the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran (the ecumenical Catholic mother church), St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls (containing the tomb of Paul the Apostle), and the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore.

Other locations of reverence for ardent Catholics include Marian shrines, particularly the localities of Fátima and Lourdes, where miracles or apparitions attributed to the Virgin Mary took place.

====Eastern Christianity====

Orthodox or Eastern Christians, like many other Christians, regard the Sepulchre in Jerusalem to be the holiest of places. They place emphasis on Nazareth, Bethlehem, Capernaum and other parts of the Holy Land as sacred since apostolic times, and note as places of special sanctity the sanctuaries built on the tombs of the apostles and other saints. There are many shrines with the relics of Christian saints and martyrs which are sacred pilgrimage sites for Orthodox Christians as well.

Historically, four of the five major episcopal sees of the Roman Empire (the Pentarchy) represent the modern patriarchal centers of the majority of Orthodox churches. These are, namely, Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople and Jerusalem – excluding Rome.

Among the Orthodox, there are many monasteries and convents which are held in high honor and sacred veneration.

=====Eastern Orthodox Church=====
If the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople is taken to be one of the most prominent leaders in the Eastern Orthodox Communion, then St. George&#x27;s Cathedral in Istanbul – the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarch – may perhaps be one of the most important religious sites for Eastern Orthodox Christians.

Also of particular importance to the Eastern Orthodox Church and particularly the Greek Orthodox Church is the peninsular Mount Athos, where the most masses in the world are celebrated daily in the Byzantine Rite. Mount Athos arguably comprises the largest community of Christian monastics, ascetics, and mystics (specifically hesychasts) in the world. It is home to twenty Eastern Orthodox monasteries under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarch.

=====Oriental Orthodox churches=====
Oriental Orthodoxy is the faith of those Eastern Christian churches that recognize only three ecumenical councils – the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople and the First Council of Ephesus. They rejected the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon (c. 451). Hence, these Oriental Orthodox Churches are also called Old Oriental Churches, Miaphysite Churches, or the Non-Chalcedonian Churches. These churches are generally not in communion with any of the multifarious Eastern Orthodox Churches but they are in dialogue for a return to unity.

Despite the potentially confusing nomenclature (Oriental meaning Eastern), Oriental Orthodox churches are distinct from those that are collectively referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church. The Oriental Orthodox communion comprises five basic groups: Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, and Armenian Apostolic churches. These churches, while being in communion with one another, are hierarchically independent.

The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church or Indian Orthodox church is technically autonomous, but still shares some ties with the Syriac Orthodox church.

This being the case, each of the six communal churches has their own spiritual headquarters which act as the episcopal sees of their respective Popes or Patriarchs:
* Armenian Apostolic – Etchmiadzin Cathedral (Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin), Vagharshapat, Armenia
* Coptic Orthodox – St. Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Abbassia in Cairo, Egypt (formerly St. Mark&#x27;s Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Alexandria, Egypt)
* Eritrean Orthodox – Asmara, Eritrea
* Ethiopian Orthodox – Holy Trinity Cathedral, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (see also Rastafari movement)
* Indian Orthodox – Kottayam, India
* Syriac Orthodox (includes the Malankara Church and other Saint Thomas Christians) – Bab Tuma borough, Damascus, Syria (formerly Antioch; temporarily stationed in Homs, Mardin, &quot;et al.&quot;)
** The Syriac Patriarch himself resides in Dayro d-Mor Ephrem, a monastery near Damascus

====Latter-day Saints====


Latter-day Saints regard with reverence such places as the Garden Tomb and the Garden of Gethsemane in Jerusalem, due their connections with the life and ministry of Jesus. Additionally, the most holy place for members of the mainstream LDS Church are the numerous temples around the world, particularly the &quot;celestial room&quot; located inside each temple. The purpose of these ordinance rooms is to act as a symbolic representation of the presence of God himself. Additionally, a room inside the Salt Lake Temple, designated as the Holy of Holies, is considered highly sacred due its primary function as a private meditation room for the church&#x27;s president.

Mormon homes are also treated as sacred areas due to the church&#x27;s emphasis on the sacredness of family union and family-based ceremonies performed in LDS temples. On this subject, the &quot;Bible Dictionary&quot; in the LDS edition of the Bible states: 
Once a Mormon family starts dwelling in a home, a special prayer is given by the head of the family (or a close member of the church) asking for the residence to be a shelter against temptation, and dedicating the place to God as long as the family inhabits it.

Other venerated sites for Latter-day Saints include historical locations throughout the United States, due to their particular connection to Mormon history and theology. Examples include the Sacred Grove (Palmyra, New York), Cumorah, the Kirtland Temple (Kirtland, Ohio) and Adam-ondi-Ahman (Daviess County, Missouri). However, no mandatory ceremonies are performed in such places.

=====Other LDS movement sects=====

Mormon breakaway sects, sub-sects and fundamentalist groups sometimes hold the belief that their particular church alone can claim true authority and succession from Joseph Smith, and that other LDS denominations are therefore incorrect or heretical. Thus many sites throughout the United States represent the spiritual headquarters&#x27; of these churches: For example, the YFZ Ranch in Eldorado, Texas, at one time represented the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (FLDS) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB) base themselves in Bluffdale, Utah.


====Rastafari movement====
Ethiopia is of considerable importance as the setting of the life and death of Haile Selassie. Many Rastas consider Ethiopia the Promised Land. The city of Shashamane is particularly significant. In the capital of Addis Ababa, Haile Selassie is buried in the Holy Trinity Cathedral (often called &quot;Kidist Selassie&quot;, from the Amharic), which is also a significant religious site for Ethiopian Orthodox Christians (see also Oriental Orthodox churches), as it doubles as the seat of the primate of their church.

=== Druze ===

Druze is a religion with between 800,000 and a million followers. Most Druzis regard &quot;Nabi Shu&#x27;ayb&quot;, or Tomb of Jethro, near Tiberias in Israel is the most important religious site for the Druze. They have held religious festivals there for centuries and it has been a place of annual pilgrimage.

The primary sanctuary of the Druze is at Khalwat al-Bayada, which is the central sanctuary, and theological school of the Druze, located in Lebanon. Located near Hasbaya, the khalwat is the location where Ad-Darazi is supposed to have settled and taught from during the first Druze call. The Kalwaat provides around forty hermitages for Al-ʻuqqāl (the initiated) at various times of the year.

===Islam===

The &quot;Kaaba&quot;, a cuboid structure located within the &quot;Masjid al-Haram&quot; (&quot;Sacred Mosque&quot;) in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, is the holiest site of Islam. According to Islamic tradition, it was rebuilt by Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Ismail (Ishmael). The Islamic prophet Muhammad laid the Black Stone in one of the corners of the building. Many millions of Muslims visit Mecca and the surrounding areas each year during a pilgrimage known as the &quot;Hajj&quot; – the fifth and final pillar of Islam – during which they circumambulate the Kaaba as part of the ritual.

Other significant areas within or surrounding Mecca include areas in which the Hajj takes place, including the Well of Zamzam, Mina and its bridge, Muzdalifah and Mount Arafat.

The second holiest place for Muslims is the Masjid al-Nabawi in Medina, which is where Muhammad is buried, under the Green Dome. Caliphs Umar and Abu Bakr are also said to be buried in the Masjid al-Nabawi.

The third holiest site in Islam is the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, which includes Jami Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock. Its holiness derives from its being the site from which Muhammad ascended to heaven in the Isra and Mi&#x27;raj, and also for having been the first &quot;qibla&quot; (the direction towards which Muslims face when praying).

The Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria, is claimed by some to be the fourth holiest site in Islam, and many Muslims believe it to be the place where Jesus will return.

The city of Hebron, in Palestine, is traditionally considered – along with Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem – one of the &quot;four holy cities&quot; in Islam, due to the presence in the city of the Cave of the Patriarchs, the holy site where Abraham is said to be buried.

Mount Sinai, in Egypt, is another holy place for Muslims.

Other sites in the Arabian Hejaz are associated with Muhammad: near Mecca, on the mountain of Jabal al-Nour, the cave Hira is the place of Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation.

==== Shia ====
Among Shias, the Imam Ali Shrine and Imam Husayn Shrine also hold high significance.

==== Nation of Islam ====

Mosque Maryam is the international headquarters of the Nation of Islam.

===== Five Percent Nation =====

Five Percenters regard the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City as a place of spiritual importance, referring to the neighborhood as &quot;Mecca&quot;. They also refer to the Brooklyn borough of New York as &quot;Medina&quot;.

Five Percenters hold a special annual event known as Show and Prove every June at the Harriet Tubman Elementary School in Harlem.

==== Ahmadiyya ====

Some individuals in the Ahmadiyya Muslim community regard Roza Bal in Srinagar, Kashmir, to be the authentic grave of Jesus.

===Judaism===

The &quot;Kodesh Hakodashim&quot;, Judaism&#x27;s Holy of Holies, was the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle in the time of Moses as described in the Torah; the term now refers to the area on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem where this sanctuary was located within the Temple in Jerusalem. Its location is often, but controversially, identified as being inaccessible, within the footprint of the Islamic Dome of the Rock, while some Jewish authors claim the Holy of Holies was actually located either to the north or to the east of the Islamic shrine.

Historically, the area of the Holy of Holies, which sat within the Jewish Temple, could be entered by the Jewish High Priest and only once a year, on Yom Kippur. Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism continue to regard the location as retaining some or all of its sanctity despite the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE. Entry into sanctified areas has been prohibited in recent times by powerful elements within traditional Judaism, and as a result many religious authorities prohibit or restrict entry into all areas of the Temple Mount by observant Jews.

Today, Jews recognize the Jewish Quarter of the city, wherein the Mount is located, to be a location of profound spiritual importance. Within the area a stone artifact known as the Western Wall is paramount as the last standing remains of the temple. Along the wall, notable features include the Western Stone and Wilson&#x27;s Arch. Beneath it a tunnel runs closer toward what was the original &quot;Kodesh Hakodashim&quot;, ending approximately 150 ft. inward at a place called Warren&#x27;s Gate.
The Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron is said to be the second holiest site in Judaism.

Other significant sites include a number of synagogue within the Jewish quarter of Old Jerusalem, namely the Hurva, Belz, Tiferet Yisrael and the Four Sephardic synagogues.

The Beit El Synagogue is of special importance to students of Kaballah.

The Biblical Mount Sinai is believed to be the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God – although there is considerable debate as to the location of the mountain. (Scholarly opinion places it at either the mountain historically known as &quot;Sinai&quot; or Mount Seir.)

===Samaritanism===
Samaritanism is an Abrahamic religion whose followers, like the Jews, claim descent from the Israelites. The Samaritan ethnoreligious group ( , ) mostly resides in the areas of present-day Israel and Palestine and claim to be the successors of the Israelite Northern Kingdom of Samaria. Samaritans consider Mount Gerizim (Samaritan Hebrew: &quot;Ar-garízim&quot;, &quot;&quot;, T.H.: הַר גְּרִזִּים &quot;Har Gərizzîm&quot;, S.H.: הַר גְּרִיזִּים &quot;Har Gərizzim&quot;; also romanized as &quot;Jirziem&quot;), a mountain in the immediately know vicinity of Nablus, in the West Bank, the holiest place on Earth. Mount Gerizim therefore has to Samaritans a role comparable to that the Temple Mount of Jerusalem has to Judaism.

==Dharmic religions==
===Buddhism===

Lumbini is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Nepal. It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Maya gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in 563 BCE. Lumbini is one of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha.

Bodh Gaya, in the state of Bihar in India, is considered by many adherents of Buddhism to be their most holy site. Gautama, who achieved Enlightenment some time around 528 BCE, became the Buddha and founded Buddhism. The Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment while sitting under a peepal tree, called the Bodhi Tree, located in Bodhgaya. At this site of his purported enlightenment the Mahabodhi Temple now stands. Every year, many Buddhists make pilgrimages from all over the world to visit and meditate at the temple.

The Buddha is said to have identified four sites most worthy of pilgrimage for Buddhists, saying that they would produce a feeling of spiritual urgency. These are:
* Lumbini, Nepal, where Queen Maya gave birth to Prince Siddhartha Gautama.
* Bodh Gaya, India, the most important religious site and place of pilgrimage, the Mahabodhi Temple houses what is believed to be the Bodhi Tree where the Buddha realized enlightenment and Buddhahood.
* Sarnath, India, the deer park where the Buddha first taught the Dhamma after realizing enlightenment.
* Kushinagar, India, where the Buddha attained Parinirvana after his death.

In the later commentarial tradition, four more sites were added to make Eight Great Places, places where a miraculous event is reported to have occurred:
*Sravasti: Place of the Twin Miracle, showing his supernatural abilities in performance of miracles. Sravasti is also the place where Buddha spent the largest amount of time, being a major city in ancient India.
*Rajgir: Place of the subduing of Nalagiri, the angry elephant, through friendliness. Rajgir was another major city of ancient India.
*Sankassa: Place of the descending to earth from Tusita heaven (after a stay of three months teaching his mother the Abhidhamma).
*Vaishali: Place of receiving an offering of honey from a monkey. Vaishali was the capital of the Vajjian Republic of ancient India.

There are various other locations in India and Nepal associated with the Buddha, and there are holy sites located throughout Asia for each Buddhist tradition, for instance in Afghanistan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Thailand. Lhasa in Tibet contains many culturally significant Tibetan Buddhist sites such as the Potala Palace, Jokhang temple and Norbulingka palaces.

====Shugendō====
Shugendō is a small, syncretic, highly esoteric and ascetic sect or sub-sect of Buddhism (mostly related to, and often considered a distinct branch of the Tendai and Shingon schools) combining elements of Zen, Taoism, Koshintō, Japanese folk animism and shamanism. The faith is traditionally believed to have been founded by the śramaṇa and mystic-sorcerer En no Gyōja in the 7th or 8th century. In the same manner as the religion of Shintō, Shugendō is largely relegated to Japan.

The lay practitioners and monks of Shugendō, called Shugenja or yamabushi respectively, venerate mountains as both spiritual areas and, along with nature as a whole, &quot;natural maṇḍalas&quot; .

Adherents of Shugendō consider the collective Three Mountains of Dewa (consisting of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan, and Mount Yudono), located in the remote Dewa Province of Japan, to be their most sacred of places. The three mountains are also sacred in Shintō.

===Hinduism===

The Indian cities of Varanasi, Ayodhya, Tirumala, Srirangam, Mathura, Haridwar, Kanchipuram, Ujjain, Puri and Dwarka are some of the more famous pilgrim cities in Hinduism. Of these, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, is considered the holiest ancient site and it is considered by many to be the most sacred place of pilgrimage for Hindus, irrespective of denomination.

Shaivas in South India, especially Tamil Nadu, consider Chidambaram as their holiest site. Vaishnavas of the region regard Srirangam as their holiest city and refer to it as the earthly abode of Vishnu, Vaikuntha.

The &quot;garbhagriha&quot; (literally womb-house or womb-chamber), the shrine inside a temple complex where the main deity is installed in an area that is in a separate building by itself inside the complex, is the most sacred site within the temple complex.

The garbhagriha usually contains the murti (idol or icon), the primary focus of prayer. In temples with a spire or vimana, this chamber is placed directly underneath it, and the two them form a main vertical axis of the temple. These together may be understood to represent the axis of the world through Mount Meru. The garbhagriha is usually also on the main horizontal axis of the temple which generally is an east–west axis. In those temples where there is also a cross-axis, the garbha griha is generally at their intersection. The Tirumala Venkateswara Temple is a Hindu temple in the hill town of Tirumala, near Tirupati in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.

The Tirumala Hill is above sea level and is about 10.33 square miles (27 km2) in area. It comprises seven peaks, representing the seven heads of Shesha, thus earning the name Seshachalam. The seven peaks are called Seshadri, Neeladri, Garudadri, Anjanadri, Vrushabhadri, Narayanadri, and Venkatadri. The temple is on Venkatadri (also known as Venkatachala or Venkata Hill), the seventh peak, and is also known as the &quot;Temple of Seven Hills&quot;. The presiding deity of the temple is Venkateswara, a form of the Hindu god Vishnu. Venkateswara is known by other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa. The temple lies on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank. The temple complex comprises a traditional temple building, with a number of modern queue and pilgrim lodging sites.

It is most-visited place of worship in the world . The temple is visited by about 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims daily (30 to 40 million people annually on average), while on special occasions and festivals, like the annual brahmotsavam, the number of pilgrims shoots up to 500,000.

There are yearly pilgrimage gatherings such as Kumbh Mela Pilgrimage (3-year or 12), Shabarimala Pilgrimage, Kottiyoor Vysakha Pilgrimage where in thousands of people gather in a certain period of a year for pilgrimage.



===Jainism===

The Palitana temples on Mount Shatrunjaya, located by the city of Palitana, in Bhavnagar district, Gujarat, India, are considered one of the holiest places for Jains. Jains believes that a visit to this group of temples is essential once in a lifetime to achieve nirvana or salvation, although many Jains frequent it many times in their lifestyle.

Shikharji or Śrī Sammed Śikharjī (श्री सम्मेद शिखरजी), also known as the Parasnath Hill, located in Giridih district in Jharkhand, India, is a major Jain pilgrimage destination and is one of the most sacred place for Jains in the world. According to Jain belief, twenty of the twenty-four Tirthankaras (teachers of the Jains) attained Moksha (Nirvana) from this place. Parasnath Hill, with a height of 1,350 metres (4,430 ft), is the highest mountain in the state of Jharkhand.
The number of Tirthankars who attained nirvana at Shri Sammet Shikharji is 20. For each of them there is a shrine on the hill.

The hill is also known as Parasnath, a name derived from Parshva, the 23rd Tirthankara who attained Nirvana there. The present temple is not very old, although the idol in the main temple is ancient. The Sanskrit inscriptions at the foot of the images indicate that they were installed in the temple in 1678 CE.

Archaeologists believe some of the existing temple edifices on Parasnath Hill date from 1765 CE although the place is of greater antiquity. It is certain that the present edifices replace older edifices, which were demolished. Jain temples are often pulled down and re-built.

===Sikhism===

Harmandir Sahib, or &quot;Darbar Sahib&quot; (also known as the Golden Temple), is culturally the most important shrine in Sikhism, considered the spiritual and cultural centre of Sikhs. Located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is one of the oldest Sikh gurdwaras. It is located in the city of Amritsar, India, which was established by Guru Ram Das, the fourth guru of the Sikhs and the city was also built around the shrine, known as &quot;Guru Di Nagri&quot; meaning city of the Sikh Guru. It is made from white marble to keep the ground cool and pleasant. It was later laid with real gold which was provided by the emperor of Sikh Empire, Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

Another significant place is the village of Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, founder of Sikhism. Each of Nankana Sahib&#x27;s gurdwaras are associated with different events in Guru Nanak Dev&#x27;s life. The town remains an important site of pilgrimage for Sikhs worldwide. Punjab province of Pakistan is also the location of many important religious and historical sites for Sikhs, including the place of martyrdom of fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev. Many other important Sikh Shrines are located in the Punjab state of India as well as other parts in India.

==East Asian religions==
===Confucianism===


Confucianism is often regarded as either a religion, philosophy or quasi-religious system of beliefs based upon the teachings of the ancient Chinese sage Confucius. Confucius&#x27;s philosophy stresses a firm sense of ethical and political order and how to achieve these ends in order to benefit society.

While Confucianism is no longer as organized of an ideology as it once was, it still continues as a quasi-religious tradition and temples of Confucius exist throughout China. The most important is the Temple of Confucius in Confucius&#x27;s hometown of Qufu. Other sites include the Cemetery of Confucius and the Kong Family Mansion in Qufu, Shandong Province of China.
===Shinto===
Ise Shrine is the formal home of Amaterasu ōmikami, the primary deity of Shinto and traditionally believed to be a direct ancestor of the Japanese Imperial Family. It is located in the city of Ise in Mie prefecture, Japan.
Access is strictly limited, with the public allowed to see merely the thatched roofs of the central structures, hidden behind three tall wooden fences. The Ise Shrine is purportedly the home of the Sacred Mirror.

===Taoism===
Four sacred mountains of Taoism:
*Wudang Mountains, in Shiyan, Hubei Province of China;
*Mount Qingcheng, in Dujiangyan, Sichuan Province;
*Mount Longhu, in Yingtan, Jiangxi Province;
*Mount Qiyun, in Huangshan, Anhui Province.

===Tenrikyo===

Followers of Tenrikyo believe that creation of the world occurred at a point called the &quot;Jiba&quot;, in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture, Japan. A pillar called the &quot;Kanrodai&quot; is erected on the exact point of the Jiba, and a set of worship halls have been constructed around it. A sacred dance is performed around the Kanrodai during the monthly worship services, and the daily prayers of Tenrikyo practitioners are performed while facing the direction of the Jiba. As it is considered that humans were originally created at the Jiba, the greeting &quot;welcome home&quot; ( in Japanese) is commonly used by believers to greet visitors.

===Church Of World Messianity===
Followers of the Church of World Messianity believe that the physical world transformation in a paradise in Earth will began in the &quot;sacred ground&quot; places that the church built in order to be the prototype of Heaven in Earth. There are actually five of these sacred grounds in the world: three in Japan, in the cities of Atami, Hakone, and Kyoto; one in Saraburi, Thailand; and one in São Paulo, Brazil.

<text>Armin Shimerman (born November 5, 1949) is an American actor known for his role as Quark the Ferengi in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, appearing as the character in all seven seasons of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1993–1999). He also had a recurring role as Principal Snyder in the first three seasons of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–1999), and voiced General Skarr and other characters in the animated series &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; (2001–2007), Doctor Nefarious in the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; video-game series, and Andrew Ryan in the &quot;BioShock&quot; video-game series.

==Early life==
Shimerman was born into a Jewish family in Lakewood, New Jersey, on November 5, 1949, the son of accountant Susan and house painter Herbert Shimerman. When he was 15, he moved with his family to Los Angeles, where his mother enrolled him in a drama group in an effort to expand his social circle. He attended Santa Monica High School and was active in drama. As a senior, he played leading roles in school productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, and &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot; before graduating in 1967. After graduating from UCLA, he was selected to apprentice at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego. He began pursuing a career in theater and eventually moved to New York City, where he was a member of the Impossible Ragtime Theater. Returning to Los Angeles, he took roles in two CBS series to launch his television acting career.

==Career==
===Acting===
====Television====

Shimerman is known for his work as the Ferengi bar owner Quark in the long-running television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, though his involvement with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise began with appearances as other Ferengi characters in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes &quot;The Last Outpost&quot; and &quot;Peak Performance&quot;. As the character Quark, Shimerman became one of Star Trek&#x27;s most widely known characters, and he appeared several times on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, either with other actors or alone as part of a collector&#x27;s series.
Along with Patrick Stewart, Marina Sirtis, Jonathan Frakes, and John de Lancie, Shimerman is one of only a few actors to play the same character on four or more different &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. He played Quark in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;. He reprised the role of Quark in the 1998 film &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, but only in deleted scenes.

In addition to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Shimerman has had roles as Pascal on &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and as Principal Snyder in 19 episodes of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. He has also starred as Anteaus in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as one of the Nox, an evil wizard in &quot;Charmed&quot;, appeared as Stan the caddy in an episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, and as Dr. Patemkin on &quot;Leverage&quot;.

Shimerman has appeared in the first seven episodes as Judge Brian Hooper in the third season of &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, joining fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors William Shatner, René Auberjonois, and Ethan Phillips. His character even shared a scene with Auberjonois, with the strife between the two characters reminiscent of the conflict between Shimerman&#x27;s Quark and Auberjonois&#x27;s Odo.

He made an appearance as &quot;The Terror&quot; in the first &quot;The Tick&quot; live-action series.

He appeared in the series &quot;Numb3rs&quot; episode &quot;Provenance&quot; as Patrick Holden. He had a small cameo in the episode &quot;Posse Comitatus&quot; of &quot;The West Wing&quot; as Richard the III and another in the film as an Old Man in the subway in &quot;What the Bleep Do We Know!?&quot;.

He has made appearances in various television series such as &quot;Babes&quot; as Mr. Ian Anderson, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as Mr. Lovejoy, &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; as Charlie Martin, &quot;Tremors&quot; as Cecil Carr, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; as Judge Graham Roberts, &quot;Castle&quot; as Benjamin Donnelly, &quot;Bad Samaritans&quot; as the Judge, and &quot;Red Bird&quot; as Max.

====Voice work====
He has voiced several video-game villains, including Toad and Zealot in &quot;X-Men Legends&quot; and &quot;X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse&quot; respectively, Andrew Ryan in the &quot;BioShock&quot; series, Razputin&#x27;s father in &quot;Psychonauts&quot;, and General Skarr from &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot; and &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;. He then lent his voice talent to BioWare for their games &quot;Jade Empire&quot; (as Emperor Sun Hai, Abbot Song, and the Innkeeper) and &quot;Mass Effect&quot; (as the original Salarian Councilor and Fai Dan). He also voiced Dr. Emil Narud, Mohandar, and Dr. Emil Narud in its human form in the 2010 RTS video game &quot;StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty&quot; and the 2013 expansion &quot;StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm&quot;, respectively.

He also voiced the role of Quark in various &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; video games, such as &quot;Harbinger&quot; and &quot;the Fallen&quot; and reprised the role in the 2018 expansion &quot;Star Trek Online: Victory is Life&quot;.

He also voiced Ben Robbins and the Shopkeeper in the first two episodes of &quot;Rocket Power&quot; from 1999 to 2000.

In 2008, he voiced the character of Wilmer in an audio dramatization of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, which also featured actors Michael Madsen, Sandra Oh, and Edward Herrmann. In addition, he voiced the character of Mr. Phillips in Focus on the Family Radio Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. He also voiced Raanu along with the villager and a village leader in the straight-to-DVD animated film &quot;&quot;. He also voices Green Goblin in the action role-playing video game &quot;&quot;.

In 2011, he provided additional voices for the MMORPG &quot;Star Wars: The Old Republic&quot;.

In 2012, he also voiced Che Garcia Hansson and Old Joseph Cajiais for the MMORPG &quot;The Secret World&quot;.

His best known voice work is that of Doctor Nefarious in the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; franchise, a role for which he received much praise.

He reprised his roles as Dr. Nefarious and Andrew Ryan and also voiced a Vox Populi enemy in the crossover fighting game &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot;.

===Writing===
====&quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;====
Shimerman co-authored a &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; novel, &quot;The 34th Rule&quot;, with David R. George III, published January 1, 1999. It focuses on his character Quark, who loses his bar and is imprisoned during a diplomatic crisis between the Bajoran and Ferengi governments. The novel is an allegory for the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.

====&quot;The Merchant Prince&quot; series====
Shimerman has co-written a series of books in which he provides a science-fictional basis for the life of John Dee. The first novel in the series, &quot;The Merchant Prince&quot;, was co-written with Irish author Michael Scott, known for his Nicholas Flamel series. Published in 2000, it features the historical figure John Dee being placed in suspended animation in 1575 by an alien race known as the Roc and awakening in 2099. The cover features Shimerman in Elizabethan garb. Shimerman commented: &quot;John Dee really did exist. We&#x27;re pretty sure he was a member of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s secret service, which put it in his purview to kill if he needed to. The Elizabethan period was a much more perilous time; you had to be quick with a dagger and nefarious in order to survive&quot;. Shimerman thought aspects of both himself and his &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; character, Quark, were in the novel&#x27;s interpretation of John Dee. Shimerman commented: &quot;There are aspects of Quark similar to Dr. Dee, and undoubtedly there are aspects of Dr. Dee similar to Armin Shimerman, which would make him seem like Quark, as well&quot;.

The other novels in the series are &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (2002), co-written with Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, known for her historical horror novels, and &quot;Capital Offense&quot; (2003).

In late 2020, Shimerman&#x27;s new book, &quot;Illyria: Betrayal of Angels&quot;, was released by publisher Jumpmaster Press. &quot;Betrayal of Angels&quot; is the first book in Shimerman&#x27;s trilogy about John Dee.

=== Teaching ===
Shimerman has been teaching Shakespeare for years, and as an adjunct professor for the University of Southern California. He also serves as Shakespeare scholar for productions in and around the Los Angeles area.

==Personal life==
Shimerman married actress Kitty Swink in May 1981.

<doc id="265468" wikidata="Q3366376" url="?curid=265468" title="Party of Democratic Kampuchea">
<text>The Party of Democratic Kampuchea was a political party in Cambodia, formed as a continuation of the Communist Party of Kampuchea in December 1981. In the mid-1980s, it publicly claimed that its ideology was &quot;a new form of democratic socialism&quot;, having ostensibly renounced Marxism–Leninism.

According to the party, the CPK&#x27;s dissolution and the PDK&#x27;s formation were prompted by the need for broader unity against Vietnam, a unity that an explicit communist line would hamper. The National Army of Democratic Kampuchea was the armed wing of the party, while the Patriotic and Democratic Front of the Great National Union of Kampuchea was a mass organization controlled by it.

The party&#x27;s General Secretary at the time was Pol Pot. The party led the deposed Democratic Kampuchea government. Its followers were generally called &quot;Khmer Rouge&quot;.

At the time of the formation of the PDK, the Khmer Rouge forces had been pushed back by the Vietnamese-backed KPRP government to an area near the Thai border. The PDK began cooperating with other anti-Vietnamese factions and formed the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea in 1982.

Although Pol Pot relinquished party leadership to Khieu Samphan in 1985, he continued to wield considerable influence over the movement.

Ahead of the 1992/1993 elections, the PDK was largely succeeded by the Cambodian National Unity Party (CNUP), which publicly stated its wish to participate in the elections but eventually did not register and vowed to sabotage the election. Subsequently, UNTAC decided not to conduct elections in areas under PDK control. At the time it was estimated that approximately six percent of the population in Cambodia lived in areas under PDK control.

The PDK was declared illegal in July 1994, after which its activities continued under the Cambodian National Unity Party and the self-proclaimed Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia.

<doc id="265476" wikidata="Q952643" url="?curid=265476" title="Santiam River">
<text>The Santiam River is a tributary of the Willamette River, about long, in western Oregon in the United States. Through its two principal tributaries, the North Santiam and the South Santiam rivers, it drains a large area of the Cascade Range at the eastern side of the Willamette Valley east of Salem and Corvallis.

==Watershed==
The main course of the river is short, formed in the Willamette Valley by the confluence of the North and South Santiam rivers on the border between Linn and Marion counties approximately northeast of Albany. It flows generally west-northwest in a slow meandering course to join the Willamette from the east approximately north of Albany.

Both the North and South Santiam rise in high Cascades in eastern Linn County. The Middle Santiam River joins the South Santiam where the South Santiam is impounded to form Foster Lake. The North Santiam is impounded to form the deep Detroit Lake in the Cascades. The Santiam is a major source of water supply for Salem.

==History==
The land surrounding Santiam river is the historic homeland of the Santiam band of the Kalapuya. Chief Alaquema (aka Joe Hutchins) of the Santiam negotiated with U.S. representative John Gain at the Santiam Treaty Council in 1851 before the forced removal of the Santiam and other Kalapuya tribes to the Grande Ronde reservation. After days of arguing, Alaquema told Gain, &quot;We understand fully what you mean and that it may be better for us, but our minds are made up.&quot; He pointed to the land between the fork of the river on a map and said, &quot;We wish to reserve this piece of land. We do not wish to leave this. We would rather be shot on it than removed.&quot; This treaty was however never ratified and in 1856 the Santiam were later forced to leave the fork in the Santiam River they had fought to preserve.

The Great Willamette Flood of 1861, which crested on December 2, destroyed many structures and animals on prairies near its confluence with the Willamette River and south of Knox Butte.

<text>Upton is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) located on Eastern Long Island in the town of Brookhaven in Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is the home of the Brookhaven National Laboratory and a National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Office (WFO) on the grounds of the national lab. This NWS WFO is code &quot;OKX&quot;, and serves the New York metropolitan area.

The town is so named because it was the site of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Camp Upton, which was active from 1917 until 1920, and again from 1940 until 1946. During World War II, the camp was rebuilt primarily as an induction center for draftees. The Army was later to use the site as a convalescent and rehabilitation hospital for returning wounded.

The 32 megawatt (MW) Long Island Solar Farm (LISF), located in Upton, is the largest photovoltaic array in the eastern United States. The LISF is made up of 164,312 solar panels which provide enough electricity for roughly 4,500 households. The project will cause the abatement of more than 30,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. It earned the Best Photovoltaic Project of Year Award from the New York Solar Energy Industries Association.

<doc id="265488" wikidata="Q7062229" url="?curid=265488" title="Not Waving but Drowning">
<text>&quot;Not Waving but Drowning&quot; is a poem by the British poet Stevie Smith. It was published in 1957, as part of a collection of the same title. The most famous of Smith&#x27;s poems, it gives an account of a drowned man, whose distant movements in the water had been mistaken for waving. The poem was accompanied by one of Smith&#x27;s drawings, as was common in her work.

The poem&#x27;s personal significance has been the topic of several pieces of literary criticism, because Smith was treated for psychological problems. She contemplated suicide at the age of eight, after what she described as a difficult childhood and her struggle with the fact that her father abandoned her.

==Interpretations==
Like many of Smith&#x27;s poems, &quot;Not Waving but Drowning&quot; is short, consisting of only twelve lines. The narrative takes place from a third-person perspective, and describes the circumstances surrounding the &quot;dead man&quot; described in line one. In line five, the poem suggests that the man who has died &quot;always loved larking,&quot; which causes his distress signals to be discounted.

The image that Smith attached to the poem shows the form of a girl from the waist up, with her wet hair hanging over her face. Although the image goes with a poem about a man drowning, the girl&#x27;s expression appears incongruous with the text of the poem, as it forms what Smith scholar Laura Severin describes as a &quot;mysterious smile&quot;. Jannice Thaddeus suggests that the speaker of the poem, like other figures in Smith&#x27;s works, changes from male to female as part of a theme of androgyny that exists in many of the poems found in &quot;Selected Poems.&quot; Severin suggests that the figure might be Mary, a character in another poem by Smith titled &quot;Cool as a Cucumber&quot;. The drawing was used as the accompanying image for the poem &quot;The Frozen Lake&quot; in &quot;Selected Poems,&quot; a self-edited compilation of Smith&#x27;s works published in 1962.

Although Ingrid Hotz-Davies suggests that the &quot;drowning man&quot; is Smith herself, she also states that there are problems with reading the poem as a cry for help, due to the humorous tone of the poem, yet at the same time she also notes that the representational form of the poem &quot;may easily be misread as a friendly wave of the hand&quot;. The poem&#x27;s simple diction led Clive James to suggest that Smith attempted to write the poem so that the diction appeared ignorant of poetic convention, yet was carefully crafted to appear more simple than it was. James describes the relationship between Smith and the speaker in &quot;Not Waving but Drowning&quot; by saying, &quot;her poems, if they were pills to cure Melancholy, did not work for [Smith]. The best of them, however, worked like charms for everyone else.&quot;

<doc id="265489" wikidata="Q217136" url="?curid=265489" title="Denali National Park and Preserve">
<text>Denali National Park and Preserve, formerly known as Mount McKinley National Park, is a United States national park and preserve located in Interior Alaska, centered on Denali (federally designated as Mount McKinley), the highest mountain in North America. The park and contiguous preserve encompass which is larger than the state of New Hampshire. On December 2, 1980, Denali Wilderness was established within the park. Denali&#x27;s landscape is a mix of forest at the lowest elevations, including deciduous taiga, with tundra at middle elevations, and glaciers, snow, and bare rock at the highest elevations. The longest glacier is the Kahiltna Glacier. Wintertime activities include dog sledding, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling. The park received 594,660 recreational visitors in 2018.

==History==
===Prehistory and protohistory===
Human habitation in the Denali Region extends to more than 11,000 years before the present, with documented sites just outside park boundaries dated to more than 8,000 years before the present. However, relatively few archaeological sites have been documented within the park boundaries, owing to the region&#x27;s high elevation, with harsh winter conditions and scarce resources compared to lower elevations in the area. The oldest site within park boundaries is the Teklanika River site, dated to about 7130 BC. More than 84 archaeological sites have been documented within the park. The sites are typically characterized as hunting camps rather than settlements and provide little cultural context. The presence of Athabaskan peoples in the region is dated to 1,500 - 1,000 years before present on linguistic and archaeological evidence, while researchers have proposed that Athabaskans may have inhabited the area for thousands of years before then. The principal groups in the park area in the last 500 years include the Koyukon, Tanana and Dena&#x27;ina people.

===Establishment of the park===
In 1906, conservationist Charles Alexander Sheldon conceived the idea of preserving the Denali region as a national park. He presented the plan to his co-members of the Boone and Crockett Club. They decided that the political climate at the time was unfavorable for congressional action and that the best hope of success rested on the approval and support of the Alaskans themselves. Sheldon wrote, &quot;The first step was to secure the approval and cooperation of the delegate who represented Alaska in Congress.&quot;

In October 1915, Sheldon took up the matter with E. W. Nelson of the Biological Survey at Washington, D.C., and with George Bird Grinnell, with the purpose to introduce a suitable bill in the coming session of Congress. The matter was then taken to the Game Committee of the Boone and Crockett Club and, after a full discussion, it received the committee&#x27;s full endorsement.

On December 3, 1915, the plan was presented to Alaska&#x27;s delegate, James Wickersham, who after some deliberation gave his approval. The plan then went to the executive committee of the Boone and Crockett Club and, on December 15, 1915, it was unanimously accepted. The plan was thereupon endorsed by the club and presented to Stephen Mather, Assistant Secretary of the Interior in Washington, D.C., who immediately approved it.

The bill was introduced in April 1916, by Delegate Wickersham in the House and by Senator Key Pittman of Nevada in the Senate. Much lobbying took place the following year, and on February 19, 1917, the bill passed. On February 26, 1917, 11 years from its conception, the bill was signed in legislation by the President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, thereby creating Mount McKinley National Park.

A portion of Denali, excluding the summit, was included in the original park boundary. The boundary was expanded in 1922 and again in 1932 and 1947 to include the area of the hotel and railroad.

On Thanksgiving Day in 1921, the Mount McKinley Park Hotel opened. In July 1923, President Warren Harding stopped at the hotel, on a tour of the length of the Alaska Railroad, during which he drove a golden spike signaling its completion at Nenana. The hotel was the first thing visitors saw stepping down from the train. The flat-roofed, two-story log building featured exposed balconies, glass windows, and electric lights. Inside were two dozen guest rooms, a shop, a lunch counter, a kitchen, and a storeroom. By the 1930s, there were reports of lice, dirty linen, drafty rooms, and marginal food, which led to the hotel eventually closing. After being abandoned for many years, the hotel was destroyed in 1972 by a fire.

The Park Road was completed in 1938 after 17 years of construction.

There was no road access to the park entrance until 1957 when the Denali Highway opened; park attendance greatly expanded: there were 5,000 visitors in 1956 and 25,000 visitors by 1958. In 1971, the George Parks Highway, under piecemeal construction for several years, was completed, providing direct highway connections to Anchorage and Fairbanks. Visitation doubled to 88,000 from 1971 to 1972.

In 1967, the park was the site of one of the deadliest mountaineering accidents in the United States with the Mount McKinley disaster, where seven climbers died in an intense blizzard on Denali. The Park Service debated closing the mountain to climbing in the wake of the accident, but ultimately it remained open.

The park was designated an international biosphere reserve in 1976. A surrounding Denali National Monument by President Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978, which was combined with the park in 1980.

===Naming dispute===
The name of Mount McKinley National Park was subject to local criticism from the beginning of the park. The word Denali means &quot;the high one&quot; in the native Athabaskan language and refers to the mountain itself. The mountain was named after newly elected US president William McKinley in 1897 by local prospector William A. Dickey. The United States government formally adopted the name Mount McKinley after President Wilson signed the bill creating Mount McKinley National Park into effect in 1917. In 1980, Mount McKinley National Park was combined with Denali National Monument, and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act named the combined unit the Denali National Park and Preserve. At that time the Alaska state Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to Denali. However, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names did not recognize the change and continued to denote the official name as Mount McKinley. This situation lasted until August 30, 2015, when President Barack Obama directed Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell to rename the mountain to Denali, using statutory authority to act on requests when the Board of Geographic Names does not do so in a &quot;reasonable&quot; period. At the beginning of his second term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to revert the name of the mountain to Mount McKinley, while explicitly leaving the name of the national park and preserve unchanged.

===1990s===

In 1992, Christopher McCandless ventured into the Alaskan wilderness and settled in an abandoned bus in the park on the Stampede Trail at , near Lake Wentitika. He carried little food or equipment, and hoped to live simply for a time in solitude. Almost four months later, McCandless&#x27; starved remains were found, weighing only . His story has been widely publicized via articles, books, and films, and the bus where his remains were found has become a shrine attracting people from around the world.

On September 24, 2020, the Museum of The North at the University of Alaska (Fairbanks) announced it became the permanent home of McCandless&#x27; &#x27;Magic Bus 142&#x27; where it will be restored and an outdoor exhibit will be created.

===2000s===
On November 5, 2012, the United States Mint released the 15th of its America the Beautiful Quarters series, which honors Denali National Park. The coin&#x27;s reverse side features a Dall sheep with Denali in the background.

In September 2013, President Barack Obama signed the Denali National Park Improvement Act into law. The statute allows the United States Department of the Interior to &quot;issue permits for microhydroelectric projects in the Kantishna Hills area of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska&quot;; it authorizes the Department of the Interior and a company called Doyon Tourism, Inc. to exchange some land in the area; it authorizes the National Park Service (NPS) to &quot;issue permits to construct a natural gas pipeline in the Denali National Park&quot;; and it renames the existing Talkeetna Ranger Station the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station. The National Parks Conservation Association supported the bill because the legislation &quot;takes a thoughtful approach to protecting roadless Alaska, promoting renewable energy development, and honoring native Alaskans.&quot;

==Geography==

Denali National Park and Preserve includes the central, highest portion of the Alaska Range, together with many of the glaciers and glacial valleys running southwards out of the range. To the north the park and preserve encompass the valleys of the McKinley, Toklat, and Foraker Rivers, as well as the Kantishna and Wyoming Hills. The George Parks Highway runs along the eastern edge of the park, crossing the Alaska Range at the divide between the valleys of the Chultina River and the Nenana River. The entrance to the park is about south of Healy. The Denali Visitor Center and the park headquarters are located just inside the entrance. The park road parallels the Alaska Range for , ending at Kantishna. Preserve lands are located on the west side of the park, with one parcel encompassing areas of lakes in the Highpower Creek and Muddy River areas, and the second preserve area covering the southwest end of the high Alaska Range around Mount Dall. In contrast to the park, where hunting is prohibited or restricted to subsistence hunting by local residents, sport hunting is allowed in the preserve lands. Nikolai, Telida, Lake Minchumina, and Cantwell residents are authorized to hunt inside the park because large portions of these communities historically hunted in the area for subsistence purposes.

===Vehicle access===
The park is serviced by the long Denali Park Road, which begins at the George Parks Highway and continues to the west, ending at Kantishna. Located within the park, the Denali Bus Depot (which houses a small gift shop, a coffee stand, and an information desk) is the main location to arrange a bus trip into the park or reserve/check-in for a campground site. All shuttle buses depart from here, as do some tours. The Denali Visitor Center is at mile marker 1.5 on the park road and is the main source of visitor information. Most ranger-led programs begin at the Denali Visitor Center. Other features include an exhibit hall. Within a short walking distance from the Visitor Center are a restaurant, a bookstore, the Murie Science and Learning Center, the Denali National Park railroad depot, and the McKinley National Park Airport.

The Denali Park Road runs north of and roughly parallel to the imposing Alaska Range. Only a small fraction of the road is paved because permafrost and the freeze-thaw cycle would create a high cost for maintaining a paved road. The first of the road are available to private vehicles, allowing easy access to the Riley Creek and Savage River campgrounds. Private vehicle access is prohibited beyond the Savage River Bridge. There is a turnaround for motorists at this point, as well as a nearby parking area for those who wish to hike the Savage River Loop Trail. Beyond this point, visitors must access the interior of the park through tour/shuttle buses. Individuals wishing to camp at Teklanika Campground (located 29 miles inside the park road) may drive their personal vehicles or RV to and from the campground.

The road has been impacted by the Pretty Rocks landslide at Polychrome Pass at Mile 45.4. NPS believes the landslide has been active since before the road was built, but only required moderate maintenance every 2–3 years. Beginning in 2014, the landslide accelerated considerably, requiring the road crew to spread 100 truckloads of gravel per week to keep the road passable until August 2021, when the park decided to close the road beyond Mile 45 until 2023 at the earliest. After studying potential solutions including re-routing the road, park officials decided to construct a bridge over the landslide which will cost $55 million and is expected to begin in 2022 and take two or three seasons to complete.

The tours travel from the initial boreal forests through tundra to the Toklat River or Kantishna. Several portions of the road run alongside sheer cliffs that drop hundreds of feet at the edges. There are no guardrails. As a result of the danger involved, and because most of the gravel road is only one lane wide, drivers must be trained in procedures for navigating the sharp mountain curves and yielding the right-of-way to opposing buses and park vehicles.

There are four camping areas located within the interior of the park (Sanctuary River, Teklanika River, Igloo Creek, and Wonder Lake). Camper buses provide transportation to these campgrounds, but only passengers camping in the park can use these particular buses. At mile marker 53 on road is the Toklat River Contact Station. All shuttle and tour buses make a stop at Toklat River. The contact station features restrooms, visitor information, and a small bookstore. Eielson Visitor Center is located four hours into the park on the road (at mile marker 66). It features restrooms, daily ranger-led programs during the summer, and on clear days, views of Denali and the Alaska Range. Wonder Lake and Kantishna are a six-hour bus ride from the Visitors Center. During the winter, only the portion of Denali Park Road near the Visitors Center remains open.

The massiveness and relative isolation of Denali lead to it generating its own weather. As a consequence, it is often surrounded by clouds and thus difficult to see; one travel guide says that the mountain &quot;often taunts visitors by hiding ... in cloud cover&quot;. Locals sometimes use the phrase &quot;the mountain is out&quot; when it makes an appearance. It is commonly said that only 30 percent of visitors to the park ever actually see Denali. An additional estimate is that only 10 percent of visitors get to see the mountain unobscured from top to bottom. Because the weather patterns are different, Denali is more frequently visible during winter months. The Eielson Visitor Center has large plate glass windows looking towards Denali; on one of them is an etched outline of the peaks of Denali, that shows where the mountain would be if it were visible.

Kantishna features five lodges: the Denali Backcountry Lodge, Kantishna Roadhouse, Skyline Lodge, Camp Denali, and North Face Lodge. Visitors can bypass the six-hour bus ride and charter an air taxi flight to the Kantishna Airport. The Kantishna resorts have no TVs, and there is no cell phone service in the area. Lodging with services can be found in McKinley Park, one mile north of the park entrance on the George Parks Highway. Many hotels, restaurants, gift shops, and convenience stores are located in Denali Park.

While the main park road goes straight through the middle of the Denali Wilderness, the national preserve and portions of the park not designated wilderness are even more inaccessible. No roads are extending out to the preserve areas, which are on the northwest and southwest ends of the park. The far north of the park, characterized by hills and rivers, is accessed from the east by the Stampede Trail, a dirt road that effectively stops at the park boundary near the former location of the &quot;Into the Wild&quot; bus. The rugged south portion of the park, characterized by large glacier-filled canyons, is accessed by Petersville Road, a dirt road that stops about outside the park. The mountains can be accessed most easily by air taxis that land on the glaciers. Kantishna can also be reached by air taxi via the Purkeypile Airport, which is just outside the park boundary.

Visitors who want to climb Denali need to obtain a climbing permit first and go through an orientation as well. These can be found at the Walter Harper Talkeetna Ranger Station in Talkeetna, Alaska, about south of the entrance to Denali National Park and Preserve. This center serves as the center of mountaineering operations. Hours of operation vary, check the National Park website for specific details.

Savage River, Eielson Visitor Center, and Wonder Lake offer maintained hiking trails, and at Riley Creek, there are several maintained trails including a hike up to Mt. Healy Overlook trail. The park also encourages off-trail hiking.
===Wilderness===
The Denali Wilderness is a wilderness area within Denali National Park that protects the higher elevations of the central Alaska Range, including Denali. The wilderness comprises about one-third of the current national park and preserve— that correspond with the former park boundaries before 1980.

==Geology==

Denali National Park and Preserve is located in the central area of the Alaska Range, a mountain chain extending across Alaska. Its best-known geologic feature is Denali, federally designated as Mount McKinley. Its elevation of makes it the highest mountain in North America. Its vertical relief (distance from base to peak) of is the highest of any mountain in the world. The mountain is still gaining about in height each year due to the continued convergence of the North American and Pacific Plates. The mountain is primarily made of granite, a hard rock that does not erode easily; this is why it has retained such a great height rather than being eroded.

The park area is characterized by collision tectonics: over the past millions of years, exotic terranes in the Pacific Ocean have been moving toward the North American landmass and accreting, or attaching, to the area that now makes up Alaska. The oldest rocks in the park are part of the Yukon-Tanana terrane. They originated from ocean sediments deposited between 400 million and 1 billion years ago. The original rocks have been affected by the processes of regional metamorphism, folding, and faulting to form rocks such as schist, quartzite, phyllite, slate, marble, and limestone. The next oldest group of rocks is the Farewell terrane. It is composed of rocks from the Paleozoic era (250–500 million years old). The sediments that make up these rocks were deposited in a variety of marine environments, ranging from deep ocean basins to continental shelf areas. The abundant marine fossils are evidence that around 380 million years ago, this area had a warm, tropical climate. The Pingston, McKinley, and Chulitna terranes are the next oldest; they were deposited in the Mesozoic era. The rock types include marble, chert, limestone, shale, and sandstone. There are intrusions of igneous rocks, such as gabbro, diabase, and diorite. Special features include pillow basalts, which are formed when molten lava flows into water and a hard outer crust forms, making a puffy, pillow-shaped feature; as well as an ophiolite sequence, which is a distinct sequence of rocks indicating that a section of the oceanic crust has been uplifted and thrust onto a continental area.

Some of the youngest rocks in the park include the Kahiltna terrane, which is a flysch sequence (a sedimentary rock sequence deposited in a marine environment during the early stages of mountain building) formed about 100 million years ago, during late Cretaceous time. Another rock sequence is the McKinley Intrusive Sequence, which includes Denali. The Cantwell Volcanics include basalt and rhyolite flows, as well as ash deposits. An example can be seen at Polychrome Pass in the park.

Mesozoic fossils include fossil trackways from therizinosaurids and hadrosaurids in the Cantwell Formation indicate the area was once an immigration point for dinosaurs traveling between Asia and North America during the Late Cretaceous period. Studies of fossil plants from the same formation indicate the area was wet, with marshes and ponds throughout the region.

Denali National Park and Preserve are located in an area of intense tectonic activity: the Pacific Plate is subducting under the North American Plate, creating the Denali Fault system, which is a right-lateral strike-slip fault over long. This is a part of the larger fault system which includes the famous San Andreas Fault of California. Over 600 earthquakes occur in the park each year, helping seismologists to understand this fault system. Most of these earthquakes are too small to be felt, although two large earthquakes did occur in 2002. On October 23, 2002, a magnitude 6.7 earthquake occurred in the park, and on November 3, 2002, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake occurred. These earthquakes did not cause a significant loss of life or property, since the area is very sparsely populated, but they did trigger thousands of landslides.

===Glaciers===
Glaciers cover about 16% of the 6 million acres of Denali National Park and Preserve. Measurements indicate that glaciers in the park are losing about 6.6 ft (2 m) of vertical water equivalency each year. There are more extensive glaciers on the southeastern side of the range because more snow is dropped on this side from the moisture-bearing winds from the Gulf of Alaska. The 5 largest south-facing glaciers are Yentna ( long), Kahiltna (), Tokositna (), Ruth (), and Eldrige (). The Ruth glacier is thick. However, the largest glacier, Muldrow Glacier ( long), is located on the north side. Nonetheless, the northern side has smaller and shorter glaciers overall. Muldrow glacier has &quot;surged&quot; twice in the last hundred years. Surging means that it has moved forward for a short time at greatly increased speed, due to a build-up of water between the bottom of the glacier and the bedrock channel floating on the ice (due to hydrostatic pressure).

At the upper ends of Denali&#x27;s glaciers are steep-walled semicircular basins called cirques. Cirques form from freeze-thaw cycles of meltwater in the rocks above the glacier and glacial erosion and mass wasting occur under the glacier. As cirques on the opposite sides of a ridge are cut deeper into the divide, they form a narrow, sharp, serrated ridge called an arête. As the arête wears away from glacial ice erosion, the low point between cirques is called a col (or if it is large a pass). Cols are saddle-shaped depressions in the ridge between cirques. A spire-like sharp peak, the horn, forms when cirques cut back into a mountaintop from three or four sides.

Glaciers deposit rock fragments, but the most notable of the depositions are the erratics, which are large rock fragments carried some distance from the source, found on glacial terraces and ridge tops in many places throughout Denali. Headquarter erratics are made of granite and can be the size of a house. Some erratics (like those from the Yanert Valley) are located away from their original location.

Large amounts of rock debris are carried on, in, and beneath the ice as the glaciers move downslope. Lateral moraines are created as debris accumulates as low ridges of till that ride along the edge of the moving glaciers. When lateral moraines adjacent to each other join, they create medial moraines, which are also carried down on the surface of the moving ice.

Braided meltwater streams heavily loaded with rock debris continually shift and intertwine their channels over valley floors. Valley trains are built up as streams drop quantities of poorly sorted sediment. Valley trains are long, narrow accumulations of glacial outwash, confined by valley walls.

Kettles are formed when glacial retreat and melting is rapid, and blocks of ice are still buried under till. When the ice under the till melts, the till slumps in and forms depressions called kettles. When kettles fill with water, they are known as kettle lakes. Kettle lakes are visible near the Polychrome Overlook, the Teklanika rest stop, and Wonder Lake.

===Permafrost===
Permanently frozen ground is known as permafrost. The permafrost is discontinuous in Denali due to differences in vegetation, temperatures, snow cover, and hydrology. The active layer freezing and thawing seasonally can be from 1 inch (25 mm) to 10 feet (3.0 m) thick. The permafrost layer is located between 30 and 100 feet (9.1 and 30.5 m) below the active layer. A stand of oddly leaning white spruce growing on a lower slope of Denali is called the Drunken Forest. The trees lean due to the soil sliding as a result of permafrost freeze/thaw cycles. Permafrost impacts the ecosystem in the park by influencing hydrology, patterns of vegetation, and wildlife. During the very cold Pleistocene climates, all of Denali was solidly frozen. The northern areas of the range are still frozen due to continued cold temperatures. About 75% of Denali had near-surface permafrost, or an active permafrost layer, in the 1950s. In the 2000s, around 50% of Denali had near-surface permafrost. It is suspected that by the 2050s, only about 6% of surface permafrost will remain. Because of climate change, most of the shallow permafrost is thawing. It is estimated that with an additional 1–2 degree warming, most of Denali&#x27;s permafrost will thaw. Permafrost thaw causes landslides as the ice-rich soil transforms into mud slurry. Landslides have previously impacted accessibility in Denali by obstructing the roads in the park. Permafrost thaw releases additional carbon into the atmosphere.

Shallow ponds in Denali are known as thaw lakes and cave-in lakes that are formed when the water warmed by the sun forms basins in the underlying permafrost. These ponds deepen gradually during the summer and, if the temperature is high enough, they will grow in size as their rims collapse.

Thermal expansion and contraction causes permafrost cracking. In the summer water fills these cracks and forms veins called ice wedges. These wedges enlarge with seasonal freezing/thawing cycles. Some ice wedges buried for centuries are revealed during excavations or landslides.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification, Denali National Park has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;). The plant hardiness zone at Denali Visitor Center is 3a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of .

Long winters are followed by short growing seasons. Eighty percent of the bird population returns after cold months, raising their young. Most mammals and other wildlife in the park spend the brief summer months preparing for winter and raising their young.

Summers are usually cool and damp, but temperatures in the 70s are not rare. The weather is so unpredictable that there have even been instances of snow in August.

The north and south side of the Alaskan Range have completely different climates. The Gulf of Alaska carries moisture to the south side, but the mountains block water to the north side. This brings a drier climate and huge temperature fluctuations to the north. The south has transitional maritime continental climates, with moister, cooler summers, and warmer winters.
==Ecology==
The Alaska Range is a mountainous expanse running through the entire park, strongly influencing the park&#x27;s ecosystems. Vegetation in the park depends on the altitude. The treeline is at , causing most of the park to be a vast expanse of tundra. In the lowland areas of the park, such as the western sections surrounding Wonder Lake, spruces and willows dominate the forest. Most trees and shrubs do not reach full size, due to unfavorable climate and thin soils. There are three types of forest in the park: from lowest to highest, they are low brush bog, bottomland spruce-poplar forest, and upland spruce-hardwood forest. The forest grows in a mosaic, due to periodic fires.

In the tundra of the park, layers of topsoil collect on rotten fragmented rock moved by thousands of years of glacial activity. Mosses, ferns, grasses, and fungi grow on the topsoil. In areas of muskeg, tussocks form and may collect algae. The term &#x27;muskeg&#x27; includes spongy waterlogged tussocks as well as deep pools of water covered by solid-looking moss. Wild blueberries and soap berries thrive in the tundra and provide the bears of Denali with the main part of their diet.

Over 450 species of flowering plants fill the park and can be viewed in bloom throughout summer. Images of goldenrod, fireweed, bluebell, and gentian filling the valleys of Denali are often used on postcards and in the artwork.

Denali is home to a variety of North American birds and mammals, including an estimated 300–350 grizzly bears on the north side of the Alaska Range (70 bears per 1,000 square miles) and an estimated 2,700 black bears (334 per 1,000 square miles). , park biologists were monitoring about 51 wolves in 13 packs (7.4 wolves per 1,000 square miles), while surveys estimated 2,230 caribou in 2013, and 1,477 moose in 2011. Dall sheep are often seen on mountainsides. Smaller animals such as coyotes, hoary marmots, shrews, Arctic ground squirrels, beavers, pikas, and snowshoe hares are seen in abundance. Red and Arctic fox species, martens, Canada lynx, and wolverines also inhabit the park but are more rarely seen due to their elusive natures.
Many migratory bird species reside in the park during late spring and summer. There are waxwings, Arctic warblers, pine grosbeaks, and northern wheatears, as well as ptarmigan and the tundra swan. Raptors include a variety of hawks, owls, and gyrfalcons, as well as the abundant but striking golden eagles.
Ten species of fish, including trout, salmon, and Arctic grayling, share the waters of the park. Because many of the rivers and lakes of Denali are fed by glaciers, glacial silt and cold temperatures slow the metabolism of the fish, preventing them from reaching normal sizes. A single amphibious species, the wood frog, also lives among the lakes of the park.

There are several non-native species in the park including common dandelion, narrowleaf hawksbeard, white sweet clover, bird vetch, yellow toadflax, and scentless false mayweed. There are 28 invasive species documented in the park and 15 of these species are considered a threat. Volunteers and park rangers work to keep non-native plant populations low.

Denali park rangers maintain a constant effort to keep wildlife wild by limiting the interaction between humans and park animals. Feeding any animal is strictly forbidden, as it may cause adverse effects on the feeding habits of the creature. Visitors are encouraged to view animals from safe distances. In August 2012 the park experienced its first known fatal bear attack when a lone hiker apparently startled a large male grizzly while photographing it. Analysis of the scene and the hiker&#x27;s camera strongly suggest he violated park regulations regarding backcountry bear encounters, which all permit holders are made aware of. Certain areas of the park are often closed due to uncommon wildlife activity, such as denning areas of wolves and bears or recent kill sites.

<text>Air France Flight 8969 was an Air France flight that was hijacked on 24 December 1994 by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA) at Houari Boumediene Airport, Algiers. The militants murdered three passengers and their intention was either to detonate the aircraft over the Eiffel Tower or the Tour Montparnasse in Paris. When the aircraft reached Marseille, the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN), a tier one counterterrorism and hostage rescue unit of the French National Gendarmerie, stormed the plane and killed all four hijackers.

The incident led to Air France halting their flights to Algeria until 2004, two years after the end of the Algerian Civil War.

==Background==

Algeria was in a state of civil war at the time of the hijacking. Aircraft flying to Algeria faced the possibility of missile attacks. As a result, Air France&#x27;s flights to Algeria had crews composed entirely of people who volunteered for the route.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved was a 14-year old Airbus A300B2-1C, registered as F-GBEC with MSN 104 and was equipped with two General Electric CF6-50C2R engines.

Bernard Dhelemme, aged 51, was the captain of the flight. Jean-Paul Borderie was the copilot, and Alain Bossuat was the flight engineer. 

==Hijacking==
===24 December===
On 24 December 1994, at Houari Boumedienne Airport in Algiers, four armed men boarded Air France Flight 8969 which was due to depart for Orly Airport, Paris at 11:15a.m. The men were dressed as Algerian presidential police; they wore blue uniforms with Air Algérie logos. Their presence originally did not cause any alarm. Two of the men began inspecting the passengers&#x27; passports while one went into the cockpit and the fourth stood guard. Claude Burgniard, a veteran flight attendant, recalled noticing that the &quot;police&quot; were armed and one of them had dynamite showing, which she considered to be unusual as the Algerian police were not normally armed when carrying out checks. The Algerian military felt suspicious on noticing that the Air France flight appeared to have an unauthorised delay, so they began surrounding the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled seeing members of the Special Intervention Group (GIS), known as &quot;ninjas&quot;, outside the aircraft. Kakachi recalled hearing one of the &quot;police&quot; say &quot;Tāghūt (),&quot; an Arabic word for &quot;tyrant&quot;, upon seeing the GIS men gathering outside the A300; she then realised that the four men on board the plane were Militants. The four hijackers then revealed that they were not police, but mujahideen seeking to establish an Islamic state in Algeria. They had hijacked the aircraft because the national airline Air France was a symbol of France, which they viewed as infidel foreign invaders.

The leader, Abdul Abdullah Yahia, already a notorious murderer, and the other three members of the Armed Islamic Group (Groupe Islamique Armé, or GIA) brandished firearms and explosives and announced their allegiance to the GIA, demanding co-operation from the 220 passengers and 12 flight crew. The hijackers had Kalashnikov automatic rifles, Uzi submachine guns, pistols, homemade hand grenades and two 10-stick dynamite packs. Later, at one point during the flight, the men placed one pack of dynamite in the cockpit and one pack under a seat in the middle of the aircraft, then linked them with detonator wire. They also took the uniforms of the pilots to confuse Algerian army snipers.
Burgniard recalled that the hijackers, in particular one called &quot;Lotfi&quot;, disliked seeing a lack of adherence to their Islamic beliefs; according to Burgniard, the hijackers objected to men and women sitting together and sharing the same toilets and women having their heads uncovered. Once they had taken control of the aircraft, the hijackers forced the women to cover their heads, including the cabin crew members. Women who did not have veils used aircraft blankets as head coverings. An elderly Algerian man told the &quot;TF1&quot; network that the hijackers &quot;had a kind of art in their terror. Twenty minutes of relaxation and twenty minutes of torture. You never knew what was next.&quot;

The men stated over the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit radio: 

Abderrahmane Meziane Chérif, the Minister of the Interior of Algeria, came to the airport control tower to begin negotiating with the hijackers, who were using the captain to speak for them. They demanded the release of two Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) political party leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who were under house arrest; the FIS was banned in Algeria in 1992. Chérif demanded that the hijackers begin releasing children and the elderly if they wanted to talk to the Algerian government. The media began arriving at the airport to cover the crisis.

At noon, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, organised a crisis team meeting, and Charles Pasqua, Interior Minister of France, met his aides. French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur was recalled from his Christmas holiday in Chamonix, France, and other government officials were also summoned from their vacations. Balladur recollected spending the entire afternoon on the telephone, trying to determine what was happening and feeling confused. According to Balladur, the Algerian authorities wanted to crack down on the Militants and Balladur himself encountered difficulties discussing the events. At one point, the hijackers dropped the demand for the release of the FIS party leaders. Two hours into the hijacking, the men told the captain to depart for Paris so that they could hold a press conference there. The captain could not take off because the aircraft boarding stairs were still attached to the plane and the Algerian authorities were blocking the runway with parked vehicles. When the hijackers forced the captain to ask for the boarding stairs to be removed, the Algerian authorities refused, determined not to give in to any of the hijackers&#x27; demands. The GIA men announced that they would detonate the aircraft unless the Algerian authorities followed their orders.

During the passport check, the hijackers had noticed that one of the passengers on the flight was an Algerian police officer. In order to force the Algerian government to comply with their demands, the hijackers approached the police officer and told him to follow them. Kakachi remembered that the police officer, seated two rows behind her, was hesitant as he did not know what they were going to do. Several passengers recalled him pleading &quot;Don&#x27;t kill me, I have a wife and child!&quot; The hijackers shot the police officer in the head at the top of the boarding stairs. The pilots and most of the passengers were not aware at first that the man had been killed. Captain Delhemme recalled that his first contact with the passenger cabin during the hijacking was when a flight attendant, allowed into the cockpit, asked the pilots if they needed anything. According to Delhemme, he asked for a glass of water from the attendant to ease the pilots&#x27; parched throats. At this point, the attendant whispered to Delhemme that the hijackers had killed a passenger.

The Algerian authorities still refused to agree to the hijackers&#x27; demands. Burgniard recalled that he and the other occupants began to realise that &quot;things were going wrong&quot; when the hijackers came to collect another passenger. They selected 48-year-old Bui Giang To, a commercial attaché at the Embassy of Vietnam in Algeria. Burgniard described To as &quot;the real foreigner on this plane&quot;. She remembered that To was not intimidated by the hijackers and she believed that this attitude upset the hijackers. The Vietnamese diplomat may have thought he was about to be released because he was a foreigner; instead he was shot dead on the boarding stairs. Delhemme recalled that when the flight attendant next appeared with refreshments, she whispered to him that two passengers, not one, had been killed.

The French government wanted to bring French military personnel into Algeria to safely resolve the hijacking, but the Algerian government would not allow foreign military to land on Algerian soil to resolve an Algerian political crisis. Prime Minister Balladur said that he asked the Algerian government &quot;extremely forcefully and urgently&quot; to give permission for the aircraft to take off. He felt that the French government held responsibility for solving the problem as the aircraft belonged to a French airline and almost a third of the passengers were French.

Seven hours into the hijacking, the cabin was calm but tense; at that point, few of the passengers knew that two people had been killed. It had grown dark outside and the aircraft was surrounded by spotlights. The pilots now attempted to defuse the situation by talking to the hijackers and trying to gain their trust. Delhemme explained that the beginning of a hijacking is violent, so the role of the pilot is to keep the participants calm, &quot;buy time&quot;, show the hijackers who the crew are as people, and find out details about the hijackers; then the pilot has to try gaining the trust of the hijackers.

During the night, Spanish authorities allowed the French military to send its forces to Majorca, Spain, which was as close to Algeria as was possible without being accused of interfering in the situation. At 8:00p.m., Groupe d&#x27;Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (GIGN) operatives boarded an Airbus A300 aircraft similar to F-GBEC, the hijacked plane, at a military base in France. En route to Majorca, the GIGN operatives were able to familiarise themselves with the A300 in preparation for storming the aircraft. After the GIGN&#x27;s plane arrived at Palma de Mallorca Airport, the Algerian government made it clear that French forces were not welcome in Algeria.

===25 December===
Captain Delhemme made a tour of the cabin at about 2 o&#x27;clock the next morning to check on the situation; he said that the cabin was &quot;calm&quot; during that time. He noticed two of the hijackers asleep on the floor. In the morning, French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur flew to Paris.

New information arrived at the Consulate General of France in Oran, Algeria, via a mole in the GIA: 

Police confirmed this plan after a raid on a safe house.

The hijackers released some of the passengers, mainly women with young children and those with severe medical conditions. Over 170 people still remained on board the plane. The hijackers offered to release the remaining Algerian passengers, but the Algerians refused to leave the aircraft. Delhemme recalled that one passenger who was refusing to leave said that he thought the crew would be killed if he did, and Delhemme believes that the passengers&#x27; motives were sincere. By the end of 25 December, the hijackers had freed a total of 63 passengers.

When the Algerian police managed to identify Yahia via night vision devices, the French government sent Yahia&#x27;s mother to plead for him to release the passengers, in the hope that she could persuade her son to give in, but the tactic backfired. One passenger, Kakachi, recalled Yahia becoming enraged by this move. At this point, the hijackers began targeting the French passengers; there were two staff members of the French Embassy in Algiers on board the flight, a secretary and a chef. The hijackers forced the chef, Yannick Beugnet, to plead into the microphone. Through Beugnet, they demanded that unless the Algerian government cleared the A300 for takeoff before 9:30p.m., they would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw him out of the door. The Algerian passengers assured him that the hijackers were bluffing while the French passengers were demanding that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the 9:30p.m. deadline passed, the hijackers shot Beugnet and threw his body outside. The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme yelled at the Algerian authorities, &quot;See what you get when you play tough?!&quot; The airline knew that the chef had been murdered as it was listening in on the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, said in an interview that the airline employees &quot;lived through [the event] with great emotion.&quot; Zahida Kakachi said Lotfi was calmly trying to convert her and another stewardess to Islam, though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage him.

The French government were informed of the events. Balladur spoke on the telephone to the Prime Minister of Algeria, Mokdad Sifi; he told him that the French government would hold the Algerian government responsible for the outcome if it did not authorise them to intervene in the situation. Just before midnight, Balladur told the President of Algeria, Liamine Zéroual, that France was ready to receive the Air France flight. As a result of Balladur&#x27;s demands, 39 hours after the start of the hijacking, Zéroual allowed the aircraft to leave Algiers. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard recalled that everyone was relieved when the aircraft departed because they thought the crisis was over.

There was insufficient fuel on board the plane to reach Paris, because the auxiliary power unit had been running since the hijackers took over the plane, so a refuelling stop was scheduled at Marseille Provence Airport. Delhemme confronted Yahia to find out whether he planned to blow up the aircraft between Algiers and Marseille. Yahia insisted that the plane would fly to Marseille, take on fuel, then fly to Paris for the press conference; reassured, Delhemme prepared for takeoff. In an interview, Delhemme suggested that the hijackers would probably have said this anyway to prevent the crew from taking action against them. Burgniard recalled that the hijackers, in the cockpit, seemed excited and &quot;like kids&quot;.

===26 December===
The aircraft approached Marseille during the early hours of 26 December. The hijackers did not know that Major Denis Favier&#x27;s GIGN squad was already in Marseille, having flown from Majorca to a military base near Marseille, and planned to storm the aircraft while it was in Marseille. The GIGN squad practised entering the A300 before Flight 8969 arrived in Marseille. Favier explained in an interview that the enemy was arriving in friendly territory, and the power difference would be a key element in the struggle. Flight 8969 landed at 3:33a.m.

Steward Claude Burgniard said that the hijackers felt that the landing in Marseille was a &quot;magic moment&quot; as they had arrived in France. Burgniard recalled that the airport was dark and that she only saw the lights of the A300 and a car that the A300 followed. The French authorities deliberately led the aircraft away from the terminal and into a remote corner of the airport. By 26 December, the French government had received information stating that the hijackers had planned to attack Paris. Favier planned to appear conciliatory and prolong the negotiations as long as possible. He believed that the hijackers were tired, so he planned to wear them down. Alain Gehin, the Chief of Police of Marseille, spoke to the group of hijackers in the control tower. Gehin implemented Favier&#x27;s strategy.

While using Delhemme to speak for them, the hijackers asked for 27 tons of fuel; the aircraft needed approximately 9 tons to fly to Paris from Marseille. The request indicated to the French authorities that the aircraft was going to be used as a firebomb or to fly the aircraft to an Islamic country sympathetic to the hijackers&#x27; cause. Hours later, the authorities received word of the firebomb plot. Passengers who were released in Algiers stated that the A300 had been rigged with explosives. Demolition experts determined that the plane was likely rigged in a way that would cause it to explode. Charles Pasqua said in an interview that the French government had decided that the aircraft was not going to leave Marseille, regardless of the consequences.

At around 8:00a.m., the hijackers demanded that the forces let the aircraft take off by 9:40a.m. The negotiators delayed the ultimatum by giving the aircraft additional food and water, emptying the toilet tanks, and providing vacuum cleaners. The GIGN operatives servicing the aircraft were disguised as airport personnel. They discovered the aircraft doors were not blocked or booby trapped. The men planted eavesdropping devices while others trained long-range &quot;cannon&quot; microphones on the A300&#x27;s fuselage and windows. Favier&#x27;s group asked the hijackers if they would rather do a press conference in Marseille instead of Paris, since all of the major media outlets had offices in Marseille. The hijackers agreed to hold a press conference on the A300. The negotiators requested that the front of the aircraft be cleared for the press conference. This was to create an area for the GIGN during the storming of the aircraft. Favier explained in an interview that the press conference was an important tactic as it allowed the passengers to be moved to the rear of the aircraft. The hijackers did not realise that the doors of the A300 could be opened from the outside.

Twelve hours after the A300 arrived at Marseille, the GIGN knew how many hijackers were on board and their location on the aircraft with the help of eavesdropping devices, infrared vision equipment, and &quot;cannon&quot; microphones. It intended to wait until sunset to take advantage of the darkness. The occupants of the aircraft were unaware of the GIGN&#x27;s true motives, and the militants were confused about why the press had not yet arrived. Yahia, frustrated by the absence of the press and sensing the authorities were up to something, ordered the pilot to move the aircraft. Delhemme parked the aircraft at the foot of the airport control tower and in close proximity to the terminal and other aircraft. An explosion in this position would result in many more casualties than in the earlier, remote location.

This was a tactical disadvantage for the GIGN; the positions were based on the aircraft being parked where the French authorities ordered the placement of the A300. When the aircraft moved, the GIGN had to quickly reorganise its forces. Favier placed snipers on the roof so they would have a view of the cockpit. He organised a group of thirty men with three passenger boarding stairs to rush the aircraft and take it over. Favier planned to have two teams, each with 11 people, open the rear left and rear right doors of the A300. A third team of eight would open the front right door. The forces planned to isolate the cockpit, with Yahia, from the rest of the aircraft.

By 5:00p.m., the authorities had not delivered any amount of fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill. He selected the youngest member of the Air France crew, who had told the hijackers that he was an atheist. Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do this. But I have no choice.&quot; Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; she knew that he kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers opened the door and fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the Quran on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire automatic machine guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline&#x27;s security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but &quot;nothing like what seemed to be about to happen&quot;. Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.

==Raid==

Once the hijackers noticed the boarding stairs moving towards them, they recognised the imminent assault. Through the cockpit window, a hijacker fired upon the stairs containing the forward GIGN team. As the first stairs reached the front starboard (right) door, it became apparent that it was elevated too high relative to the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to an overestimation of the necessary height of the boarding stairs. After a short delay in repositioning the stairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets. The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft. Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin. The GIGN&#x27;s concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers&#x27; homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage. The snipers on the tower could not initially get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Moments later, Borderie pulled himself out of the cockpit window and dropped to the ground. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers in the rear of the aircraft.

Flight attendant Claude Burgniard described the firefight as &quot;the apocalypse&quot;. Christophe Morin, a flight attendant, recalled that the GIGN ordered passengers and crew to get down as low as possible with their hands over their heads, hide, and then to not move. Morin described the situation as &quot;violent&quot;. He recalled putting his overcoat over his head so he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two held hands. Pilot Bernard Delhemme said that he was in &quot;a rather bad spot&quot;, so he crouched and made himself &quot;as small as possible&quot;.

A few minutes after the beginning of the assault, most of the passengers had escaped. At that point, three of the four hijackers were fatally shot. Delhemme recalled that the cockpit only had himself, the flight engineer, and the last hijacker. Delhemme said that the hijacker could have killed him and his colleagues out of spite, but did not. In an interview, Denis Favier explained that there likely was a mutual recognition and &quot;respect&quot; between the hijackers and the hostages. He believes the bonds between the hijackers and hostages helped save lives of passengers and crew in the conflict.

GIGN commando Philippe Bardelli was leading a column up the front right stairs, as that team was tasked with throwing stun grenades in the cockpit, when a 7.62 × 39 mm bullet from an AK-47 hit his drawn pistol and detonated the cartridges; Bardelli later remarked that his pistol thereby saved his life, since such AK-47 rounds were able to penetrate the GIGN&#x27;s helmet visors. The remaining hijacker kept the GIGN at bay for 20 minutes, but he eventually ran out of ammunition and died from a gunshot wound. Meanwhile, the GIGN operatives were not sure which men were the hijackers and how many were still alive, so they considered all male passengers as potentially being hijackers. The flight engineer, Alain Bossuat, radioed the tower stating that the hijackers were dead and that there were no more left. This signaled to GIGN forces that a final clearing of the A300 could begin. Delhemme said that when the forces entered the aircraft, they ordered him to put his hands on his head. Delhemme said that, after the hijacking ordeal had run its course, he refused to leave with his hands on his head and be &quot;punished like a child&quot;. Burgniard said that when she saw Bossuat handcuffed, the cabin crew told the forces to let him go as the individual was the flight engineer. At 5:35p.m., Favier radioed to the tower that the incident was over; the incident had unfolded over 54 hours.

All of the hijackers had been killed. The remaining passengers and crew survived the 20-minute gun battle. Of the remaining passengers, 13 received minor injuries. Nine of the 30 GIGN operatives received injuries; of them, one received serious wounds. Three crew members received injuries. Delhemme was hit by bullets in his right elbow and thigh. Bossuat received minor injuries; the dead bodies of two hijackers had shielded Delhemme and Bossuat from gunfire. Borderie, the most seriously injured, fractured his elbow and thigh from the 5-metre (16 ft) drop. Favier said that he determined that the operation was a success since none of the GIGN received fatal injuries. French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur said that the events unfolded &quot;exceptionally well&quot;.

==Aftermath==
As a result of the damage to the aircraft, the A300 was written off and later scrapped at the airport in September 1995. Several hours after the incident ended, the Armed Islamic Group, which had claimed responsibility for the event, killed four Roman Catholic priests in retaliation in Tizi-Ouzou, Algeria. Three of the priests were French, while one was Belgian.

The crew of the A300 and the GIGN forces received high national honours. Charles Pasqua, then the Minister of the Interior, said that throughout the ordeal the crew &quot;rose to the occasion&quot;. Bernard Delhemme returned to flying and worked for Air France for nine years before retiring. Flight attendant Claude Burgniard said that she &quot;kept seeing the faces&quot; of the three passengers who had been executed; when she received her medal she realised that she had helped save 173 people; this allowed her to mourn and get over the incident. Burgniard said that she does not wear the medal, but that she felt like she deserved it. Burgniard, who also received a message of thanks from the airline, never again worked for Air France. Flight attendant Christophe Morin stopped working for Air France and began to work for a charitable organisation.

A former militant group leader admitted that the men had planned to detonate the aircraft over the Eiffel Tower. The militant group never again attempted this plot. Pasqua said that if the militants crashed an aircraft on the Eiffel Tower or the Élysée Palace, they would have committed what they would believe to be &quot;an extraordinary feat.&quot;

Flights between Algiers and Paris are now Flights 1355, 1451, 1555, 1755, and 1855 (operating to Charles de Gaulle instead of Orly). Flight number 8969 is now a codeshare flight number for Delta Air Lines flight number 1584 between Greater Rochester International Airport and Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.

==Passengers and crew==
Most of the passengers were Algerians; 138 of the passengers were Algerian citizens. A significant number of the passengers were French people leaving Algeria. Captain Bernard Delhemme said that the hijackers, who had extensively planned the operation, did not anticipate that most of the passengers would be Algerians. The hijackers recited Quran verses and tried to reassure the Algerian passengers. Witness accounts said that they terrorised non-Algerians.


==Hijackers==
25-year-old Abdul Abdullah Yahia, also known as &quot;The Emir&quot;, was a petty thief and greengrocer from the Bab El Oued neighbourhood of Algiers. By the time of the hijacking, he was notorious for beheading Algerian policemen. The negotiators said that Yahia spoke &quot;approximate&quot; French and always ended his sentences in &quot;Insha&#x27;Allah&quot; (&quot;God willing&quot;). Several passengers said all but one of the hijackers had no beards and closely cropped hair. A woman said that the men &quot;were polite and correct&quot; and that they &quot;had the determined air of cold-blooded killers&quot;. Another passenger said the hijackers &quot;seemed excited, very euphoric&quot; and that they told the occupants that they would teach the French and the world a lesson and show what they were capable of doing.

As the hijacking progressed, the passengers recognised the personalities of the hijackers. Claude Burgniard, a flight attendant, recalled that the crew and passengers gave nicknames to the hijackers &quot;to make things simpler&quot;. Yahia, the leader, had given his name, so the passengers called him by that name. According to Burgniard, Lotfi had a &quot;peculiar&quot; character, &quot;was always on a knife edge&quot;, and &quot;the most fanatic&quot; and &quot;the most fundamentalist&quot; of the hijackers. Therefore, he received the nickname &quot;Madman&quot; from the passengers. According to Burgniard, Lotfi was the hijacker who insisted that the passengers follow Islamic law. Lotfi found women having their heads uncovered &quot;intolerable&quot;, making him very angry. One hijacker did not give his name to the passengers, so they called him &quot;Bill&quot;. Burgniard stated that Bill was &quot;a little bit simple&quot; and &quot;more of a goatherd than a terrorist.&quot; She said his role as a hijacker was &quot;an error in casting&quot;. Burgniard remembered that the occupants wondered why Bill was there and that they saw Bill appearing as if he wondered why he was there, as well. The hijacker nicknamed &quot;The Killer&quot; shot the hostages whom the hijackers had targeted.

==In popular culture==
The events of Flight 8969 were featured in &quot;The Killing Machine&quot;, a Season 2 episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday,&quot; with the episode using a mix of re-enactments and actual footage. Flight 8969 captain Bernard Delhemme and Colonel Denis Favier, then a major who was head of the GIGN counter-terrorist unit assigned to the flight, gave their first television interviews for &quot;Mayday&quot;, appearing in silhouette, as both felt under threat after the events and that members of the public believed that the militants were offering a reward for Favier&#x27;s assassination.

Flight attendant Christophe Morin and passenger Zahida Kakachi co-authored the book &quot;Le vol Alger-Marseille: Journal d&#x27;otages&quot;, recalling the events of the attack and how it had affected their lives.

A one-hour documentary, episode 3 of the UK BBC Two television series &quot;The Age of Terror&quot;, was transmitted on 29 April 2008. This showed an in-depth reconstruction of the hijacking, and included interviews with passengers, crew, and GIGN commandos. It was stated explicitly that a mole within the GIA terrorists informed the French authorities that the intention was to use the aircraft as a missile to attack Paris.

The 2011 French film &quot;The Assault&quot;, directed by Julien Leclercq, based on the book &quot;L&#x27;Assaut: GIGN, Marignane, 26 décembre 1994, 17 h 12&quot; by Roland Môntins, depicts the events of Flight 8969. It was reportedly made with the collaboration and advice of the GIGN.

<doc id="265496" wikidata="Q1338812" url="?curid=265496" title="Excel Saga">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kōshi Rikudō. It was serialized in Shōnen Gahōsha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Young King OURs&quot; from 1996 to 2011, and its individual chapters were collected and published in 27 volumes . The series follows the attempts of Across, a &quot;secret ideological organization&quot;, to conquer the city of Fukuoka as a first step towards world domination. The title character of the series, Excel, is a key member of the group who is working towards completing this goal, while the city is being defended by a shadowy government agency led by Dr. Kabapu.

The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Victor Entertainment, which was taglined . Directed by Shinichi Watanabe and featuring animation from J.C.Staff, the series premiered on TV Tokyo in 1999. TV Tokyo only aired twenty-five of the series&#x27; twenty-six episodes, with the finale having been intentionally made too violent, obscene and long for broadcast on Japanese TV. As such, it was only included in the DVD release of the series, although it has since been broadcast in other markets.

The series has enjoyed some critical success coupled with respectable sales.

==Plot==
Believing the World to be corrupt, the secret organization Across plans to conquer the world. The first step in the plan for world domination is to begin by focusing on one city in order to minimize setbacks. Across consists of the leader of the organization, Il Palazzo, and his young adult officers: the enthusiastic and energetically devoted Excel and the soft-spoken Hyatt, who is prone to fainting and losing lots of blood at a time. Excel and Hyatt live in an apartment building in the city, along with their pet dog Menchi, who they have deemed their emergency food supply. Excel and Hyatt are later joined by a snobbish but equally clueless rival officer of Across named Elgala.

Living in the neighboring apartment are three guys: Iwata, Sumiyoshi and Watanabe, who along with apartment neighbor and co-worker Matsuya, work for the Department of City Security. The Department&#x27;s leader, Dr. Kabapu, also has a grandiose plan on stopping Across; he has the City Security workers dress in Super Sentai-like uniforms and sends them on different missions. Supporting Kabapu is an inventor Gojo Shiouji who likes little girls, and his gynoid Ropponmatsu, who later is deployed as two models.

The series follows the daily interactions among the two groups. Il Palazzo would send the girls on their missions but the results are usually a failure with some explosive or catastrophic damage to the city. Kabapu would send the City Security workers on some equally ridiculous assignment which would also go wrong. Eventually Il Palazzo and Kabapu become aware of each other&#x27;s manipulations and escalate their plans. Excel finds herself being replaced by an impersonator who heads the ILL Corporation. Massive amounts of money is spent on elections and politics. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City&#x27;s citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans.

The anime adaptation introduces some original characters: immigrant worker turned wandering spirit Pedro; alien mascot-like creatures called Puchuu; and The Great Will of the Macrocosm, the last of whom occasionally resets the storyline. The anime director Shinichi Watanabe cameos as an afro-wearing guy named Nabeshin, and a caricature of the manga artist also makes appearances.

==Production==
The series was created by Rikdo Koshi and based on a dojinshi he had previously created while in high school named . &quot;Excel Saga&quot; was created as an evolution of &quot;Daitenzin&quot; in order to develop the character of Excel, as well as to laugh off the vision of a depressed and pessimistic view of the world. &quot;Excel Saga&quot; is set in Fukuoka City and the names of characters and organisations are derived from local locations and buildings.

Victor Entertainment contacted Shōnen Gahōsha about adapting &quot;Excel Saga&quot; into an anime, and the two companies approached Rikdo. Shinichi Watanabe was chosen as director. Watanabe added his own alter ego, Nabeshin, and expanded several elements. He says that the Great Will in the manga was &quot;conveyed just as words&quot;, and he himself developed its appearance, eventually settling on the &quot;swirling, talking cosmos&quot;. He also increased Pedro&#x27;s role in the story from a single frame in the manga. Watanabe says he was pleased with that aspect of his work, noting that &quot;Pedro&#x27;s situation was considered unsuitable for broadcast in Japan&quot;. The anime production staff was given the freedom to do anything they wanted as long as they kept the theme of the series intact, and Rikdo requested they created a separate timeline; this departure from the original work was acknowledged in-story, with each episode opening with a caricature of Rikdo giving &quot;Nabeshin&quot; permission to diverge from the source material, hence the anime&#x27;s &quot;Quack Experimental&quot; tagline. Rikdo would later become influenced by the anime series due to its quick broadcast in comparison to the monthly schedule of the manga. The anime makes frequent use of parody and in-jokes as comedic devices, with each episode having a genre-based theme. This extends to the animation, with several characters designed in the style of other works, such as those by Leiji Matsumoto. Kotono Mitsuishi was chosen to play the role of Excel, and Watanabe was impressed with Mitsuishi&#x27;s rapid delivery of her lines, saying that &quot;she really pushed herself to the limit and beyond&quot;. He also says, &quot;at times she was too fast, and there was plenty of time left to match the lip-synch&quot;. In such cases, either he would add new material or Mitsuishi would ad-lib. At first Rikdo felt stunned and uncomfortable at hearing Excel speak, but he called the casting &quot;amazing&quot; and was pleased to hear his favourite voice actors read lines from his work.

==Media==
===Manga===

The series began serialization in 1996 in Shōnen Gahōsha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Young King OURs&quot; and finished in August 2011. The individual chapters were collected in 27 volumes by Shōnen Gahōsha from April 23, 1997, to October 29, 2011. A 60-page one-shot was publishes in &quot;Young King OURs&quot; on December 28, 2021, to celebrate the series&#x27; 25th anniversary.

Viz Media licensed &quot;Excel Saga&quot; for an English release in North America and the first volume was released on August 13, 2003. Initially the series was published on an approximately bimonthly schedule, however the series had caught up with the Japanese release and the publishing schedule for volume 12 onwards was changed as a result. Volume 27 was released on January 14, 2014. The Viz edition includes a section called &quot;Oubliette&quot;, which consists of a sound effects guide and production and cultural notes. The series is also licensed for regional language releases in France by Kabuto and in Italy by Dynit.

===Anime===
An anime adaption was produced by J.C.Staff and directed by Shinichi Watanabe. Twenty five episodes were broadcast on TV Tokyo between October 7, 1999, and March 30, 2000. At the publisher&#x27;s request, the anime series follows a different storyline from the manga, however Rikdo was pleased with the adaptation. Victor Entertainment produced the music of the series, which was composed and arranged by Toshio Masuda and directed by Keiichi Nozaki. Director Shinichi Watanabe wrote the lyrics for the opening and closing themes. The opening theme which were performed by Yumiko Kobayashi and Mikako Takahashi who were credited as &quot;The Excel♥Girls &quot;. The lyrics for the opening theme were written &quot;on the train, five minutes before the deadline&quot;. The closing theme was The two themes were released together as a CD single on November 3, 1999.

A twenty-sixth episode, &quot;Going Too Far&quot;, was deliberately created to be too violent and obscene for broadcast in Japan and was instead included as a DVD bonus. Watanabe commented that it &quot;felt good to go past the limits of a TV series&quot;, although he thinks it &quot;is not something that you should do too often&quot;. In Japan the series was released on 12 DVDs between March 1, 2000, and January 24, 2001.

The series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films and in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment.

==Reception==
Since its August 2003 release in North America, the manga has been among the 50 top-selling graphic novels on three occasions. 

The English-language reviews of the &quot;Excel Saga&quot; anime were broadly positive and enthusiastic. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network puts it in the same class as &quot;Airplane!&quot;, &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, Tex Avery, and Monty Python, adding that the &quot;combination of character-based humor, outrageous slapstick farce, and a plot that is engaging if only for how weird it is make for a thoroughly enjoyable comedic experience&quot;. A contrary opinion is expressed by Joel Pearce from DVD Verdict, who says the series is &quot;occasionally clever and funny,&quot; but that &quot;much of it is gratingly obnoxious&quot;. Many reviewers express displeasure with middle and later episodes, saying they were &quot;more of the same,&quot; that they had stale humor, that they were tiresome, or even painfully unfunny. Episodes fourteen through sixteen, starring the Ropponmatsus, bear the brunt of this criticism, but several reviewers consider episode seventeen, &quot;Animation USA&quot;, to be one of the best.

Reviewers also agree that the series suffers from too much filler in its later episodes, with Crandol describing the show as spinning its wheels. Yegulalp reserves his harshest words for the unaired &quot;Going Too Far&quot;, calling it &quot;pure, idiotic, wretched excess.&quot; He goes on to say that the episode has &quot;the feeling of trying to deliberately enrage the audience by resorting to the only tactics left: genuinely offensive subject matter.&quot; Joel Cunningham at Digitally Obsessed disagrees, saying that the episode succeeds just in time, &quot;with one of the series&#x27; funnier sight gags&quot;.

The series generally receives high marks for technical aspects. Cunningham feels the animation is flat-out gorgeous, but Crandol considers it merely above average. In the latter&#x27;s opinion, its quality wanes as the series progresses and increasingly relies on super-deforming the characters for comedic effect. ADV&#x27;s release earned praise for the quality of the video transfer and the DVD extras (particularly the Vid-Notes). Reviewers especially appreciated the English voice acting: Crandol calls it brilliant, and several note that Calvello and Wolcott were each able to capture Mitsuishi&#x27;s Excel. Pearce, in contrast, found the English cast to be pretty bad and its Excel to be &quot;dental drill shrill&quot;.

Akadot&#x27;s reviewer of the manga writes that &quot;some of the strange events go on a little too long and do not have the impact that they do animated,&quot; but that Rikdo&#x27;s &quot;Excel Saga&quot; is &quot;graced with fantastic visuals and a hilarious story,&quot; and that the English edition is &quot;a masterpiece of the translator&#x27;s skill.&quot; Barb Lien-Cooper from Comic World News concurs that the manga cannot keep pace with the anime, but she finds Excel herself to be wittier in the manga and that the manga&#x27;s plots make more sense than the anime&#x27;s. A reviewer of the French edition also praises Rikdo&#x27;s work, noting that it is an &quot;...easy read without problems of clarity&quot;.

<doc id="265500" wikidata="Q3555519" url="?curid=265500" title="Presbyterian Church in America">
<text>The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) is the second-largest Presbyterian church body, behind the Presbyterian Church (USA), and the largest conservative Calvinist denomination in the United States. The PCA is Reformed in theology and presbyterian in government.

==History==
===Background===
Presbyterians trace their history to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. The Presbyterian heritage, and much of its theology, began with the French theologian and lawyer John Calvin (1509–64), whose writings solidified much of the Reformed thinking that came before him in the form of the sermons and writings of Huldrych Zwingli. From Calvin&#x27;s headquarters in Geneva, the Reformed movement spread to other parts of Europe. John Knox, a former Catholic priest from Scotland who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland, took Calvin&#x27;s teachings back to Scotland and led the Scottish Reformation of 1560. As a result, the Church of Scotland embraced Reformed theology and presbyterian polity. Immigrants from Scotland and Ireland brought Presbyterianism to America as early as 1640, and immigration would remain a large source of growth throughout the colonial era. Another source of growth were a number of New England Puritans who left the Congregational churches because they preferred presbyterian polity. In 1706, seven ministers led by Francis Makemie established the first American presbytery at Philadelphia, which was followed by the creation of the Synod of Philadelphia in 1717.


The PCA has its roots in theological controversies over liberalism in Christianity and neo-orthodoxy that had been a point of contention in the Presbyterian Church in the United States which had split from the mainline Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A along regional lines at the beginning of the Civil War. While the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy had led to a split in the PC-USA in the mid-1930s, leading to the formation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Bible Presbyterian Church, the PCUS remained intact. However, beginning in 1942, as the PCUS began to experiment with confessional revision, and later, when neo-orthodoxy and liberalism began to become influential in the PCUS&#x27; seminaries, and attempts were made to merge with the more liberal PC-USA and its successor, the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., renewal groups began to be formed, including the Presbyterian Churchmen United, which had been formed by more than 500 ministers and ran 3/4-page statements of their beliefs in 30 newspapers, the Presbyterian Evangelistic Fellowship, conducted revivals in PCUS churches, the Concerned Presbyterians, and the Presbyterian Churchmen United (PCU), an organization of conservative pastors in the Southern Presbyterian Church. They sought to reaffirm the Westminster Confession of Faith as the fullest and clearest exposition of biblical faith, which many conservatives felt that presbyteries had been violating by receiving ministers who refused to affirm the virgin birth and bodily resurrection, and to expect all pastors and leaders to affirm the inerrancy of scripture. Opponents of the merger took specific issue with the United Presbyterian Church&#x27;s adherence to the Auburn Affirmation and the Confession of 1967; the Southern Presbyterian denomination rejected the adoption of these confessions as official standards, noting amorphous biblical doctrine, lax sexual ethic, and conversations with other church bodies that rejected the Reformed faith, such as those explored by the Consultation on Church Union.

It remains controversial as to whether racial tensions may have contributed to the formation of the PCA. Many in the PCA have adamantly maintained that race played little role in the genesis of the new denomination, but many outside the PCA have a historical memory of racial animus irrefutably contributing to the desire for exodus from the Southern Presbyterian denomination, the PCUS. However, on June 23, 2016, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in America voted to approve a statement on racial reconciliation that specifically recognized &quot;corporate and historical sins, including those committed during the Civil Rights era, and continuing racial sins of ourselves and our fathers such as the segregation of worshipers by race; the exclusion of persons from Church membership on the basis of race; the exclusion of churches, or elders, from membership in the Presbyteries on the basis of race; the teaching that the Bible sanctions racial segregation and discourages inter-racial marriage; the participation in and defense of white supremacist organizations; and the failure to live out the gospel imperative that ‘love does no wrong to a neighbor’ (Romans 13:10).&quot; This admission of &quot;historical sins&quot; during the Civil Rights era has helped to ameliorate the conflict that some black members of the PCA may have felt about the denomination&#x27;s failure to fully embrace and protect the rights of African Americans both within and outside of the church during the PCA&#x27;s formative years.

Conservatives also felt the church should disavow the ordination of women. They also criticized the PCUS Board of Christian Education&#x27;s published literature and believed that the denomination&#x27;s Board of World Missions no longer placed its primary emphasis on carrying out the Great Commission. In 1966, conservatives within the PCUS, concerned about the denominational seminaries founded Reformed Theological Seminary.

Finally, when word came out that a planned Plan of Union between the UPCUSA and PCUS lacked an &quot;escape clause&quot; which would have allowed for PCUS congregations that wanted no part in the planned union to leave without forfeiture of property, the steering committee of several of the renewal groups called for conservative PCUS congregations to leave.

In December 1973, delegates, representing some 260 congregations with a combined communicant membership of over 41,000 that had left the PCUS, gathered at Briarwood Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and organized the National Presbyterian Church, which later became the Presbyterian Church in America.

After protests from a UPCUSA congregation of the same name in Washington, D.C., the denomination at its Second General Assembly (1974) renamed itself the National Reformed Presbyterian Church, then adopted its present name the next day. At its founding, the PCA consisted of 16 presbyteries.

Within a few years the church grew to include more than 500 congregations and 80,000 members.

===Growth===
==== Kenyon Case – PCA growth in the Mid-Atlantic (1975) ====
During the 1970s, the denomination added a significant number of congregations outside the South when several UPCUSA churches in Ohio and Pennsylvania joined. This move was precipitated by a case regarding an ordination candidate, Wynn Kenyon, denied by the Pittsburgh Presbytery because he refused to support women&#x27;s ordination (a decision upheld by the UPCUSA General Assembly). The seceder churches formed the Ascension Presbytery, officially organised on July 29, 1975. That year, a minister of that presbytery described its history as follows:
For example, seceders from Union UPCUSA formed Providence Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh under the leadership of Broadwick.

====PCA expands in the Midwest====
Dozens of churches from the Midwest became part of the Presbyterian Church in America after leaving the Synod of the West of the PC(USA), formerly called the United Presbyterian Church in the USA. This became the Siouxlands Presbytery composed of only South Dakota, but in 1982 the Joining and Receiving took place with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod, boundaries were expanded to cover Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa.

In the state of Michigan, dissenting Christian Reformed and RCA church members formed Covenant Presbyterian Church in Holland, MI in 1996 under the leadership of Tom Vanden Heuvel, former pastor of First Christian Reformed Church (Grand Rapids, Michigan), who claimed that the Christian Reformed Church(CRC) departed from its original commitment to the clarity and authority of Scripture. At that time, another CRC church joined the PCA in Texas, as well as in New York, the Monsey Christian Church.

====Departures from the PCUS (1973–1990)====
Dissenting conservative Southern Presbyterian Churches joined the PCA until the early 1990s. Early PCA growth was largely through secessions from the Southern Presbyterian Church (PCUS), which from 1983 to 1990 allowed churches to leave with their property. About 110 to 120 churches did come in during that period of time to the PCA with their properties, allowed by various PC(USA) Presbyteries. Since that time, PCA growth has been largely through church planting and local congregational outreach rather than by transfers of entire churches from other denominations. PC(USA) ministers are now required to agree with the ordination of women, which the PCA opposes. However, since 1996 about 23 PC(USA) congregations have joined the PCA. As of the 2014 PC(USA) General assembly, most churches withdrawing from the PC(USA) are joining the Evangelical Presbyterian Church or the newly formed ECO due to their acceptance of women ministers, though since then many conservative PC(USA) groups and even whole congregations have affiliated with the PCA.

====Merger with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (1982)====
In 1982, the PCA merged with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (RPCES), with 25,673 communicant members and 482 ministers in 189 congregations in the United States as well as in a few Canadian provinces. Discussions had begun in 1979 with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod, which had itself come about due to a merger between the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (formerly the Bible Presbyterian Church – Columbus Synod and not the current denomination of the same name) and the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod (a group of &quot;New Light&quot; Covenanters). The RPCES brought to the PCA a more broadly national base of membership with a denominational college, Covenant College, and a seminary, Covenant Theological Seminary. Previously, the PCA had relied on independent evangelical institutions such as Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi and Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The PCA had originally invited three denominations to the merger, including the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA). The OPC voted to accept the invitation to join the PCA, but the PCA voted against receiving them. The PCA presbyteries did not approve the application by the required three-quarters majority, and so the proposed invitation process was terminated without the OPC presbyteries voting on the issue. The RPCES was the only church to carry through with the merger. The merger was called &quot;Joining and Receiving.&quot; When a sufficient number of RPCES and PCA presbyteries voted in favor of the plan, the final votes occurred at the respective annual meetings, both held in Grand Rapids, Michigan: the RPCES Synod voted to join the PCA on June 12, 1982, and the PCA General Assembly voted to receive the RPCES on June 14. The Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod agencies and committees were united with their PCA counterparts. The history and historical documents of the RPCES were incorporated into the PCA. Graduates from Covenant College and Seminary were also officially recognized. 
The move reflected a rare phenomenon in American Protestantism of two conservative denominations merging, an occurrence that was far more common among mainline, moderate-to-liberal bodies in the 20th century (such as the UPCUSA/PCUS reunion). In 1982 the RPCES had 25,718 communicant members in 187 congregations served by 400 pastors. The PCA had 519 churches, 91,060 communicant members, and 480 pastors. After the merger the PCA membership was 706 churches, 116,788 communicant members, and 1,276 teaching elders.

In 1986 the PCA again invited the Orthodox Presbyterian Church to join them, but without success. Not everyone agreed with the decision. In the four years after 1986, there was a voluntary realignment as congregations left the OPC for the PCA, mainly from California, Montana and Pennsylvania, but also from as far as Alaska.
By the 1970s, the OPC had grown a new ‘pietist/revivalist’ wing under the influence of Jack Miller. According to Tim Keller, the New Life Churches and their Sonship course represented classic revivalism, and it did not fit well with the more doctrinalist cast of the OPC. The New Life Churches were made to feel unwelcome and nearly all left in the early 1990s to swell the pietist ranks of the PCA.

====Nationwide growth====

In 1983 several PCUS churches had joined the PCA, instead of merging with the UPCUSA into the current PC (U.S.A.); others joined the recently formed Evangelical Presbyterian Church, unrelated to the 1950s and 1960s body of that name. 
A clause in the Plan of Union between the two mainline bodies allowed dissenting PCUS congregations to refrain from joining the merger and to join a denomination of their choosing.

At the 20th anniversary of the PCA in 1993 there were 1,086 congregations and 242,560 members.

The PCA Historical Center, a repository of archives and manuscripts, is located in St. Louis, Missouri.

The PCA is one of the denominations in the United States, with some 1,700 churches and missions throughout the US and Canada. There were some 335,000 communicant and non-communicant members as of December 2000.

In 2004 the former PC(USA) member First Presbyterian Church in Charleston, MS voted to join the PCA rather than the EPC, which allows women as church officers. Hospers Presbyterian Church in Hospers, Iowa was also PC(USA), joined the PCA in November 2006. Park Cities Presbyterian Church was formed when about 1,500–2,000 former Highland Park Presbyterian Church (Dallas, Texas) member separated from the PC(USA) and joined PCA.
In 2013 and 2014 a few disappointed conservative PC(USA) congregations from New York state and from the Presbytery of Sheppards &amp; Lapsley (Unity Presbyterian in Weogufka, AL, and Southwood Presbyterian in Talladega, AL) in the state of Alabama and Smyrna Korean Presbyterian Church in Enterprise, AL joined the Presbyterian Church in America instead of ECO or EPC, which have women ministers. Several PC(USA) breakaway groups like New Covenant Presbyterian Church in McComb, MS which broke from J.J. White Memorial Presbyterian Church in 2007, and First Scot&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, PCA in Beaufort, South Carolina (formerly First Scots Independent Presbyterian Church) voted to affiliate with the PCA. As well as several independent Anglo and till now unaffiliated Korean Presbyterian churches like Greater Springfield Korean Church in Agawam, Massachusetts.
According to the PC(USA) statistics 7 PC(USA) congregations with 550 members joined PCA, excluded the seceder groups since 2005.

Doctrinal debate in the Reformed Church in America led some RCA congregations like Grace Reformed Church in Lansing, Illinois (Pastor Andy Nearpass), the Peace Community Church from Frankfort, IL (Kurt Kruger), Crete Reformed Church in Crete, IL (Pastor David Smith), First Reformed Church in Lansing, IL (Pastor Ben Kappers), Mission Dei Church in New Lenox, Illinois (Pastor Paul Vroom) and University Reformed Church in East Lansing, Michigan (Pastor Kevin DeYoung) to join the PCA as a conservative alternative.

Each of the churches was allowed to withdraw with their respective properties and assets after paying a varying settlement fee to the Illiana-Florida Classis. But if a church should withdraw from the PCA within five years of the approval of the agreement, then the property is to revert to the Classis of Illiana-Florida. the University Reformed Church was also granted dismissal by the RCA Classis on March 21, 2015.

Kevin DeYoung the pastor of University Reformed Church summarized the reasons of withdrawing from the Reformed Church in America and affiliate with the PCA:
==Doctrine and practice==


The PCA includes representation from all the historic Calvinist branches of Presbyterianism. The PCA&#x27;s founding churches came out of the Southern Presbyterian church, which included revivalists, Old Siders, classic ‘Princeton’ Old Schoolers, conservative New Schoolers, and others. In 1982, the PCA merged with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod, which itself was the product of a union between the ‘New Light’ (New Side) Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod, and parts of the Bible Presbyterian church (the pietistic New School). In addition, many evangelical congregations that had lived within the mainline Presbyterian churches, both north and south, left as individual churches and joined the PCA. In short, the PCA has been formed with churches and leaders from many different branches—Old School, Old Side, New School.

 A Synopsis of the Beliefs of the Presbyterian Church in America 

*The Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and practice.
*There is one God, eternal and self-existing in three persons (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) who are to be equally loved, honored, and adored.
*All mankind participated in Adam&#x27;s fall from his original sinless state and is thus lost in sin and totally helpless.
*The Sovereign God, for no other reason than His own unfathomable love and mercy, has chosen lost sinners from every nation to be redeemed by the quickening power of the Holy Spirit and through the atoning death and resurrection of His son, Jesus Christ.
*Those sinners whom the Spirit quickens, come to believe in Christ as Savior by the Word of God, are born again, become sons of God, and will persevere to the end.
*Justification is by faith and through it the undeserving sinner is clothed with the righteousness of Christ.
*The goal of God&#x27;s salvation in the life of the Christian is holiness, good works, and service for the glory of God.
*At death the Christian&#x27;s soul passes immediately into the presence of God and the unbeliever&#x27;s soul is eternally separated from God unto condemnation.
*Baptism is a sign of God&#x27;s covenant and is properly administered to children of believers in their infancy as well as to those who come as adults to trust in Christ.
*Jesus Christ will return to earth, visibly and bodily, at a time when He is not expected, to consummate history and the eternal plan of God.
*The Gospel of God&#x27;s salvation in Jesus Christ must be published to all the world as a witness before Jesus Christ returns.

===Confessions===
The Presbyterian Church in America motto is &quot;Faithful to the Scriptures, True to the Reformed faith, Obedient to the great commission of Jesus Christ.&quot; The PCA professes adherence to the historic confessional standards of Presbyterianism: the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Westminster Shorter Catechism, and the Westminster Larger Catechism. These secondary documents are viewed as subordinate to the Bible, which alone is viewed as the inspired Word of God.

&quot;True to the Reformed Faith:&quot; https://www.pcaac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PCA-Clerks-of-Session-Handbook.pdf

===Education and ministries===
As might be expected given Presbyterianism&#x27;s historically high esteem for education, the PCA has generally valued academic exploration more highly than revivalist traditions of evangelicalism. Apologetics in general and presuppositional apologetics has been a defining feature with many of its theologians and higher-ranking clergy, and many also practice &quot;cultural apologetics&quot; by engaging with and participating in secular cultural activities such as film, music, literature, and art to win them for Christ.

Additionally, the PCA emphasizes ministries of mercy such as outreach to the poor, the elderly, orphans, Native Americans, people with physical and mental disabilities, refugees, etc. As a result, the denomination has held several national conferences to help equip members to participate in this type of work, and several PCA affiliates such as Desire Street Ministries, New City Fellowship, and New Song Fellowship have received national attention for their service to the community at large.

===Life issues===
The PCA is anti-abortion and opposes euthanasia, according to the official statement adopted at the 16th General Assembly in 1988: &quot;Euthanasia, or &quot;mercy-killing&quot; of a patient by a physician or by anyone else, including the patient himself (suicide) is murder. To withhold or to withdraw medical treatment, as is being discussed here, does not constitute euthanasia and should not be placed into the same category with it.&quot;

===Marriage===
The PCA is against divorce, except in cases of adultery or abandonment (desertion).

The PCA takes the following position on homosexuality: &quot;Homosexual practice is sin. The Bible teaches that all particular sins flow from our rebellious disposition of heart. Just as with any other sin, the PCA deals with people in a pastoral way, seeking to transform their lifestyle through the power of the gospel as applied by the Holy Spirit. Hence, in condemning homosexual practice we claim no self-righteousness, but recognize that any and all sin is equally heinous in the sight of a holy God.&quot; The PCA officially opposes same-sex marriage. However, according to the Pew Forum study conducted in 2014, about 50% of the members believe that homosexuality should be accepted and 40% same-sex marriage. Roy Taylor, Stated Clerk of the General Assembly of the PCA, has said that the PCA &quot;believes that, from creation, God ordained the marriage covenant to be a bond between one man and one woman&quot; and that &quot;divinely sanctioned standard for sexual activity is fidelity within a marriage between one man and one woman or chastity outside of such a marriage. Throughout history, there has often been a conflict between the unchanging standards of biblical ethics that the Church seeks to maintain and the changing social practices of the culture.&quot; In 2020, the PCA&#x27;s Committee Report on Human Sexuality concluded that it is generally unwise for Christians to identify themselves as gay Christian even if they abstain from homosexual activities due to homoerotic desires being sinful in nature. Furthermore, the PCA officially affirmed the Nashville Statement at their annual General Assembly in 2019.

However, the denomination has had mixed statements concerning the ordination of celibate or non-practicing gay men. A 1977 statement of the General Assembly had restricted from ministry only &quot;practicing homosexuals&quot;—as opposed to non-practicing. That precedent has since been called into question. Between 2018 and 2021, denominational conservatives lobbied for a series of investigations and a judicial case against celibate PCA pastor Greg Johnson on account of his 2019 admission in Christianity Today that, as a gay atheist who converted to Christianity in college, his sexual orientation had nevertheless never changed. Critics sought Johnson&#x27;s removal for identifying as a gay or same-sex attracted man and for arguing against Sexual orientation change efforts as ineffective. Johnson requested investigation by his regional presbytery, which exonerated him in 2019 and again in 2020. In 2020, Johnson&#x27;s exoneration was appealed to the denomination&#x27;s Standing Judicial Commission. On October 22, 2021, that denominational court ruled in Johnson&#x27;s favor by a vote of 16 to 7. While Johnson has stated that he has never been sexually active, significant opposition to Johnson&#x27;s openness about his sexual orientation led the denomination&#x27;s General Assembly in 2021 to propose changes to its constitution to prevent other celibate nonstraight people from ordination to ministry in the PCA.
In 2014, in response to media confusion between the PCA and the PCUSA, the stated clerk&#x27;s office issued the following:

=== Social and theological differences with the Presbyterian Church (USA) ===

=== Comparison to other Presbyterian denominations ===

The PCA is more socially and theologically conservative than the PC(USA). The PCA requires ordained pastors and elders to subscribe to the theological doctrines detailed in the Westminster Standards, with only minor exceptions allowed, while the PC(USA)&#x27;s Book of Confessions allows much more leeway. The PCA ordains only men who profess traditional marriage, while the PC(USA) allows the ordination of both women and (in certain Presbyteries) non-celibate gays and lesbians as clergy. Like the PC(USA), however, the PCA accommodates different views of creation. The PCA strives for racial reconciliation. The PCA is unilaterally anti-abortion, believing life begins at conception. Unlike the PC(USA), the PCA has no ecumenical relationship with organizations which accept denominations that they perceive to have strayed from orthodoxy, such as the World Council of Churches or World Communion of Reformed Churches. Due to problems related to church property when splitting from the PC(USA), in the PCA all church buildings belong to the local church, which gives the PCA a slightly more congregational church structure than most other Presbyterian structures.

The PCA is generally less theologically conservative than the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC, founded in 1936), but more conservative than the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC, founded in 1981) and the Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO, founded in 2012), though the differences can vary from presbytery to presbytery and even congregation to congregation. The PCA, as mentioned above, will not ordain women as teaching elders (pastors), ruling elders, or deacons, while the EPC considers this issue a &quot;non-essential&quot; matter left to the individual ordaining body, and ECO fully embraces women&#x27;s ordination. However, there is an increasingly strong movement in the PCA to allow ordination of women as deacons including overtures in the General Assembly. A number of PCA churches are known to have non-ordained women deacons and deaconesses. The EPC is also more tolerant of the charismatic movement than the PCA. However, there is a strong New Calvinist movement in the PCA that practices contemporary music, adheres to a continuationist position on the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and engages in civil dialogue with differing theological views. This is not surprising since PCA has issued, from its inception, a pastoral letter to all the PCA churches to tolerate the charismatics within its ranks.

The PCA has little doctrinal quarrel with the OPC. Both denominations have similar views on the Federal Vision, creation and justification. While most OPC congregations allow women only to teach children and other women in Sunday school, some moderate PCA congregations allow women to do anything a non-ordained man can do. While the OPC and the PCA both adhere to the Westminster Standards, the OPC is generally more strict in requiring its officers to subscribe to those standards without exception. It is hard to find any doctrinal differences between these two denominations. In recent years the OPC and PCA published substantial similar reports on the Creation Days, the debate about Justification and the issue of the Federal Vision. They have identical positions on social issues like women in combat, Freemasonry and abortion. The only divergence of any significance is the matter of charismatic gifts. The OPC maintains a strict cessationist position, while the PCA allows presbyteries to ordain non-cessationists if they do not believe that ongoing gifts are on par with Special Revelation. Many PCA churches have moved toward contemporary worship, while the OPC is dominated by traditional Reformed worship. The southern roots of the Presbyterian Church in America were tempered somewhat by the merger with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod and the northern roots of the OPC was also tempered by the influence of Van Til and Kuyper. Nonetheless, the two denominations enjoy fraternal relations and cooperate in a number of ways, such as sharing control of a publication company, Great Commission Publications, which produces Sunday School curricula for both denominations.

== Church government ==

The PCA maintains the presbyterian church government set forth in its Book of Church Order. Local church officers include teaching elders, ruling elders and deacons. The BCO is based on the PCUS Book of Church Order declared it in force on May 19, 1879. The distinction between pastors and elders in the PCA is a mixture of two traditions. The PCA holds to a quasi-parity of pastors and elders (named Ruling and Teaching Elders; REs and TEs for short), where Ruling and Teaching Elders have the same voting rights in the courts of the church and can participate in each other&#x27;s examinations and ordinations, yet there are certain and definite ways that TEs and REs are distinct. Pastors have deference as moderators of local church Sessions. Only Pastors may administer the sacraments and ordinarily only pastors may preach (REs must be licensed by a presbytery if they wish to preach regularly). Also, REs are members of their local churches, while pastors are members of their presbyteries and not members of the local churches they serve. While this 2.5 office view is the consensus of the PCA, many would hold to a more Northern three-office view and others would hold to a more Southern two-office view. Church government is exercised at three levels: the Session, which governs the local church; the Presbytery, a regional governing body, and the General Assembly, the highest court of the denomination. The PCA is committed to a principle of voluntary association and all PCA congregations own their own property. Additionally all giving to the administration and permanent committees of the PCA is voluntary. The PCA does not have Synods, which some other groups have either as the highest court or as an intermediate court between presbyteries and the general assembly.

== Statistics ==

=== Membership trends ===
In 1995, the PCA was described as one of the fastest-growing denominations in the United States, having experienced steady growth since its founding in 1973. In 2009, the PCA reported &quot;a net loss in members for the first time.&quot; In 2016, the denomination reported growth over a five-year period. From 2017 to 2021, the PCA reported having 374,736 in 2017, 384,793 in 2018, 383,721 in 2019, 383,721 in 2020, and 378,389 in 2021.

As of December 31, 2011, the Presbyterian Church in America had 1,771 churches (includes established churches and new church plants) representing all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 5 Canadian provinces.
There were 351,406 communicant and non-communicant members. The PCA has 83 presbyteries or regional governing bodies. The latest formed in January 2014.
In 2012 the PCA had 1,777 congregations – 1,474 particular and 303 mission churches – that means a net increase of 6, membership developed by 12,613 total of 364,019. The number of ordained PCA ministers are 4,321.

The PCA had 384,793 members in 1,927 congregations served by 4,951 ordained ministers in 2017.

Less than 50% of the PCA churches send statistical report, and the stated supply believes the membership of the PCA experienced modest growth.

The PCA is one of the most diverse Protestant denominations in the US with about 20% non-white members.

More than 250 churches of the denomination are ethnic Korean churches with 9 non-geographical Korean language presbyteries, which is about 15% of the total.

The PCA has grown tenfold in thirty years. This was partly the result of the union with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod and the voluntary realignment of some Orthodox Presbyterian Churches.
For example, in Georgia the PCA has 14 congregations and 2,784 member in 1973, but in 2006 there were 93 congregations and 22,000 members. In 2015 there were about 150 congregations. This is more than tenfold growth of the denomination in the Peach State.

The PCA is among the top 5 denominations that are most aggressive in church planting in North America.

=== Adherents and population penetration ===
The greatest concentration is in the states of the Deep South, with more scattered strength in the Upper South, the upper Ohio Valley, and the Southwest. Two-thirds of PCA churches and members are found in the Southeast, and 25 churches are in the Metro Atlanta area.

The state of Florida has the most PCA churches with more than 160 congregations, but Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, and Texas in the South and Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia on the East Coast remain strongholds for the denomination. In the five southeastern US States (Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, and Georgia) the PCA had 742 congregations, making up more than one third of the total 1,771 churches. Mississippi has the highest percentage of adherents per 1,000 people, followed by Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, Delaware, and Georgia. Numerous mega churches can be found in the American South and East as well as in Illinois, but the largest and the second largest churches in the denomination are Korean churches. A Korean congregation, Sarang Community Church of Southern California in Anaheim, CA, is the biggest congregation in the denomination with as many as 11,000 members.
==== In Canada ====

When the Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod merged with the PCA, Canadian congregations entered the union. Since the merger, other congregations have been added through evangelism. Canadian churches report that &quot;secularism and unbelief provide an opportunity to evangelism&quot;. There are more than 22 congregations in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

==== Outside North America ====
The PCA has a presbytery in Chile with more than five congregations and missions.

The Potomac Presbytery proposed to elect a provisional presbytery in the Latin American county of Paraguay with 4–5 congregations and church plants in Asunción and the nearby cities. The Presbytery worked in the country for 15–20 years. The goal is to establish a National Presbyterian Church in Paraguay.

=== Demographics ===
==== Korean churches ====
The membership of the PCA is predominantly Caucasian (80%), but the denomination includes more than 260 Korean-American Churches in 9 Korean Presbyteries. The first Korean Presbytery was formed in 1982; since then the number of presbyteries has grown to 9, namely the Korean Capital Presbytery, the Korean Central Presbytery, the Korean Eastern Presbytery, the Korean Northeastern Presbytery, the Korean Northwest Presbytery, the Korean Southeastern Presbytery, the Korean Southern Presbytery and the Korean Southwest Presbytery, and the recently formed Korean Southwest Orange County Presbytery.

Korean PCA churches have contributed significantly to the denominational leadership and the church at large. In 2013, Michael Oh was appointed CEO of Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization. In 2014, Lloyd Kim was appointed coordinator of Mission to the World. In 2017, PCA elected its first non-Anglo moderator, Alexander Jun. The same year, Joel Kim was appointed as president of Westminster Seminary California. In 2019, Walter Kim was elected president of National Association of Evangelicals and in 2020, Julius Kim was selected as president of The Gospel Coalition.

Koreans comprise approximately 15% of the denomination, and the majority of them are located in the West coast and Northeast regions. In recent years several independent Korean congregations have joined the PCA to be a part of a conservative Presbyterian denomination. The largest PCA church is a Korean church located in Anaheim, CA called Sarang Community Church of Southern California and the second largest, Korean Central Presbyterian Church in Centreville, Virginia. All the Korean churches in the PCA appoint non-ordained deaconesses and women encouragers (Kwonsa) who are elected and installed so that women can care for other women in the church. Such has been the practice of all Korean Presbyterian churches since its inception which is practiced across denominational boundaries.

==== Hispanic churches ====
There are about 40 Hispanic American PCA churches in Alabama, Florida, California, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and also in Virginia.

==== Brazilian congregations ====
Approximately 15 Brazilian or Portuguese-speaking congregations was affiliated with the denomination in 2011, mainly in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Georgia, New Jersey and Florida.

==== Others ====
Several multi-ethnic African American, Haitian, Japanese, Nepali, Albanian, Indian, Sudanese, Indonesian Russian ethnic churches belong to the Presbyterian Church in America and the denomination begun to build relationship with the First Nations/Native American groups in the United States and Canada.

The PCA has congregations outside North America. These International congregations can be found in the Grand Cayman Island, in Okinawa, Japan, South Korea, Prague and various cities (Berlin, Cologne, Stuttgart and Munich) in Germany.

== Affiliations and agencies ==

=== Missions ===
Additionally, the denomination has its own agency for sending missionaries around the world (Mission to the World)(MTW). Through Mission to the World well over 600 foreign missionaries are working in about 60 nations. Mission to North America serves PCA churches and presbyteries through the development of evangelism and church planting in Canada and the USA. An average of 3 new churches are planted in a month in the 2 nations and currently has more than 300 mission churches in the United States alone. More than 40% of all congregations are less than 25 years old, due to church planting. The PCA puts into the field the world&#x27;s largest Presbyterian mission force after that of the Global Missions Society of the Presbyterian Church in Korea (HapDong) with over 2,500 missionaries.

The PCA church planters must raise their own support and the denomination turned to the use of church planting networks of like-minded churches to found church planters. The PCA frequently use the evangelist model of starting a new church where the evangelist under the oversight of the Presbyteries home missions committee has the power of the sessions in his own person.
The PCA supports one foreign missionary for every three congregations.

Further, there are more than 100 chaplains in the military, hospitals, prisons and 45 college and university campus ministers. The church has high emphasis on education.

=== Educational and Theological institutions ===
The PCA has its own ministry to students on college campuses, the Reformed University Fellowship, its own camp and conference center, the Ridge Haven Conference and Retreat Center (Ridge Haven in Brevard, North Carolina), and its own liberal arts college (Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Georgia, near Chattanooga, Tennessee) and seminary (Covenant Theological Seminary in Saint Louis, Missouri). Covenant Theological Seminary is a fully accredited theological institution that offers several academic degrees: Master of Divinity, Master of Arts, Master of Theology and Doctor of Ministry. The Seminary is home to the Francis Schaeffer Institute. 
The PCA also publishes its own denominational magazine, &quot;byFaith&quot;.

=== Headquarters ===
The church maintains headquarters in Lawrenceville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. The site was once the headquarters of the PCUS, but all offices of the united PC(USA) were moved to Louisville, Kentucky in 1988.

The PCA Ministry Buildings in Lawrenceville is the location from which the ministries of the denomination are coordinated. These ministries are Mission to the World, Mission to North America, Christian Education and Publications, Administrative Committee and Reformed University Fellowship (RUF).

== Relations with other Reformed Churches ==

In 1975, the PCA joined the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC), Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA), Reformed Presbyterian Church, Evangelical Synod (RPCES) and Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA) in becoming charter members of the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council (NAPARC), of which it remains a part.

The PCA is also part of the World Reformed Fellowship, a worldwide organisation of Churches where about 70 Reformed, Presbyterian and Reformed Baptist, Anglican denominations, as well as congregations and individuals can also participate.
It was a member of the National Association of Evangelicals, but voted on June 22, 2022 to leave the organization.

The Presbyterian Church in America enjoys fraternal relations with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. In 2008 the Presbyterian Church of Brazil and the Presbyterian Church in America entered into full fraternal relationship with each other. The National Presbyterian Church in Mexico and the PCA also work together in missions and evangelizing. In 2012 at the PCA 41st General Assembly the Presbyterian Church in America and the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico entered into an assembly level ecclesiastical relationship.
In 1994 The Fellowship of Reformed Churches was formed and was a product of the dialogue between the PCA, the Presbyterian Church in Brazil and the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico. They decided to invite other Latin American Reformed Churches to join the Fellowship.

PCA missionaries have helped found the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Ukraine, the Christian Presbyterian Church in Portugal, the Iglesia Reformada Evangélica Presbiteriana de Colombia, the Presbyterian Church in America, Chile, the Africa Evangelical Presbyterian Church and the Westminster Presbyterian Church of Australia.

<doc id="265508" wikidata="Q91267385" url="?curid=265508" title="Shadowlands (play)">
<text>Shadowlands is a play by William Nicholson adapted from his 1985 television film of the same name, directed by Norman Stone and produced by David M. Thompson for BBC Wales. It debuted at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth on 5 October 1989 before premiering at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London on 23 October 1989. The play is about the relationship between Oxford don and author C. S. Lewis and the American writer Joy Gresham.

==Synopsis==
The story follows Lewis as he meets an American fan, Joy Gresham, whom he befriends and eventually marries. The story also focuses on his relationship with his brother, Warren Lewis and deals with his personal struggle: Lewis preaches that one should endure suffering with patience, but finds that the simple answers he had preached no longer apply when Joy becomes afflicted with cancer and eventually dies.

==Historical casting==
== Production history ==
The play opened at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth on 5 October 1989 before transferring to the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London on 23 October 1989, running until 8 September 1990. The stage version gave Joy Davidman only one son instead of two. The production was directed by Elijah Moshinsky and starred Nigel Hawthorne as Lewis with Jane Lapotaire as Joy. It won Best Play in the Evening Standard Awards for 1990. Lapotaire was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress for her stage performance.

Hawthorne successfully took the role of Lewis to Broadway, playing at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre from November 1990 to April 1991 and again directed by Moshinsky. It was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. Hawthorne co-starred in New York, with Michael Allinson as Warren Lewis and Jane Alexander as Joy, who was now given her maiden name of Joy Davidman. Hawthorne won a 1991 Tony award for Best Actor, while Nicholson picked up a nomination for Best Play.

The first major revival of the play, starring Charles Dance as Lewis and Janie Dee as Joy, premiered at Cambridge Arts Theatre on 5 September 2007 before touring the UK. The production, directed by Michael Barker-Carven, transferred to the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre on 3 October 2007 for an eleven-week season before transferring to the Novello Theatre where it ran from 21 December 2007 to 23 February 2008.

A new production of &quot;Shadowlands&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre opened on 26 April 2019. The production, which was directed by Rachel Kavanaugh, starred Hugh Bonneville as Lewis, Liz White as Joy Gresham and Andrew Havill as Warren Lewis.

==Quotes==
Joy in the stage version:
&quot;See yourself in the mirror, you&#x27;re separate from yourself. See the world in the mirror, you&#x27;re separate from the world. I don&#x27;t want that separation anymore.&quot;

<text>Myrtaceae (), the myrtle family, is a family of dicotyledonous plants placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, pōhutukawa, bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus are some notable members of this group. All species are woody, contain essential oils, and have flower parts in multiples of four or five. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually entire (i.e., without a toothed margin). The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera, the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured, and numerous.

== Evolutionary history ==
Scientists hypothesize that the family Myrtaceae arose between 60 and 56 million years ago (Mya) during the Paleocene era. Pollen fossils have been sourced to the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. The breakup of Gondwana during the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 Mya) geographically isolated disjunct taxa and allowed for rapid speciation; in particular, genera once considered members of the now-defunct Leptospermoideae alliance are now isolated within Oceania. Generally, experts agree that vicariance is responsible for the differentiation of Myrtaceae taxa, except in the cases of &quot;Leptospermum&quot; species now located on New Zealand and New Caledonia, islands which may have been submerged at the time of late Eocene differentiation.

== Diversity ==
Recent estimates suggest the Myrtaceae include about 5,950 species in about 132 genera. The family has a wide distribution in tropical and warm-temperate regions of the world, and is common in many of the world&#x27;s biodiversity hotspots. Genera with capsular fruits such as &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, &quot;Corymbia&quot;, &quot;Angophora&quot;, &quot;Leptospermum&quot;, and &quot;Melaleuca&quot; are absent from the Americas, apart from &quot;Metrosideros&quot; in Chile and Argentina. Genera with fleshy fruits have their greatest concentrations in eastern Australia and Malesia (the Australasian realm) and the Neotropics. &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; is a dominant, nearly ubiquitous genus in the more mesic parts of Australia and extends north sporadically to the Philippines. &quot;Eucalyptus regnans&quot; is the tallest flowering plant in the world. Other important Australian genera are &quot;Callistemon&quot; (bottlebrushes), &quot;Syzygium&quot;, and &quot;Melaleuca&quot; (paperbarks). Species of the genus &quot;Osbornia&quot;, native to Australasia, are mangroves. &quot;Eugenia&quot;, &quot;Myrcia&quot;, and &quot;Calyptranthes&quot; are among the larger genera in the neotropics.
Historically, the Myrtaceae were divided into two subfamilies. Subfamily Myrtoideae (about 75 genera) was recognized as having fleshy fruits and opposite, entire leaves. Most genera in this subfamily have one of three easily recognized types of embryos. The genera of Myrtoideae can be very difficult to distinguish in the absence of mature fruits. Myrtoideae are found worldwide in subtropical and tropical regions, with centers of diversity in the Neotropics, northeastern Australia, and Malesia. In contrast, subfamily Leptospermoideae (about 80 genera) was recognized as having dry, dehiscent fruits (capsules) and leaves arranged spirally or alternate. The Leptospermoideae are found mostly in Australasia, with a centre of diversity in Australia. Many genera in Western Australia have greatly reduced leaves and flowers typical of dryer habitats.

== Taxonomy ==
The division of the Myrtaceae into Leptospermoideae and Myrtoideae was challenged by a number of authors, including Johnson and Briggs (1984), who identified 14 tribes or clades within Myrtaceae, and found Myrtoideae to be polyphyletic. Molecular studies by several groups of authors, as of 2008, have confirmed the baccate (fleshy) fruits evolved twice from capsular fruits and, as such, the two-subfamily classification does not accurately portray the phylogenetic history of the family. Thus, many workers are now using a recent analysis by Wilson et al. (2001) as a starting point for further analyses of the family. This study pronounced both Leptospermoideae and Myrtoideae invalid, but retained several smaller suballiances shown to be monophyletic through matK analysis.

The genera &quot;Heteropyxis&quot; and &quot;Psiloxylon&quot; have been separated as separate families by many authors in the past as Heteropyxidaceae and Psiloxylaceae. However, Wilson &quot;et al.&quot; included them in Myrtaceae. These two genera are presently believed to be the earliest arising and surviving lineages of Myrtaceae.

The most recent classification recognizes 17 tribes and two subfamilies, Myrtoideae and Psiloxyloideae, based on a phylogenetic analysis of plastid DNA.

Many new species are being described annually from throughout the range of Myrtaceae. Likewise, new genera are being described nearly yearly.

== Ecology ==

Myrtaceae is foraged by many stingless bees, especially by species such as &quot;Melipona bicolor&quot; which gather pollen from this plant family. Some Australian species such as &quot;Tetragonula hockingsi&quot; and &quot;T. carbonaria&quot; are also known to collect resin from the mature seed pods of &quot;Corymbia torelliana&quot;, resulting in &quot;mellitochory&quot; as the seeds get stuck onto the corbiculae of the bees and sometimes are successfully disposed of by colony members that remove them. But usually, they get stuck in the hives or near hive entrances instead, hence also making it a minor nuisance for some keepers as they can take up a lot of space. Fortunately, this is only known to occur in the eastern areas of Australia, but could occur in other neighbouring countries where some &quot;Corymbia&quot; species are native.

Weevils in the tribe Cryptoplini mostly use Myrtaceae as hosts. Their larvae can develop in flower and fruit buds, or in galls (often galls already formed by other insects).

<text>is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

, the city has a population of 373,797, and a population density of . The total area is . Yokosuka is the 11th-most populous city in the Greater Tokyo Area, and the 12th in the Kantō region. The city is home to United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka.

==Geography==
Yokosuka occupies most of Miura Peninsula, and is bordered by the mouth of Tokyo Bay to the east and Sagami Bay on the Pacific Ocean on the west.

===Surrounding municipalities===
* Hayama
* Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama
* Miura
* Zushi

==History==
===Pre-modern period===
The area around present-day Yokosuka City has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools and shell middens from the Japanese Paleolithic period and ceramic shards from the Jōmon and Kofun periods at numerous locations in the area. During the Heian period, local warlord Muraoka Tamemichi established Kinugasa Castle in 1063. He became the ancestor of the Miura clan, which subsequently dominated eastern Sagami Province for the next several hundred years. The Miura clan supported Minamoto no Yoritomo in the foundation of the Kamakura shogunate, but were later annihilated by Hōjō Tokiyori in 1247. However, the family name was reassigned to a supporter of the Hōjō clan, and the Miura continued to rule Miura Peninsula through the Muromachi period until their defeat at Arai Castle in a 1518 attack by Hōjō Sōun. Following the defeat of the Later Hōjō clan at the Battle of Odawara, Toyotomi Hideyoshi transferred Tokugawa Ieyasu to take control over the Kantō region, including Yokosuka in 1590.

The English sailor William Adams, the first Briton to set foot in Japan, arrived at Uraga aboard the Dutch trading vessel &quot;Liefde&quot; in 1600. In 1612, he was granted the title of samurai and a fief in Hemi within the boundaries of present-day Yokosuka, due to his services to the Tokugawa shogunate. A monument to Adams (called &quot;Miura Anjin&quot; in Japanese) is a local landmark in Yokosuka.

During the Edo period, Yokosuka &quot;tenryō&quot; territory was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various . Due to its strategic location at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, the Shogunate established the post of Uraga &quot;Bugyō&quot; in 1720, and all shipping into the bay was required to stop for inspection. As concerns over the increasing number of incursions by foreign vessels and attempts to end Japan&#x27;s self-imposed national seclusion policy, the Shogunate established a number of coastal artillery batteries around Yokosuka, including an outpost at Ōtsu in 1842. However, despite these efforts, in 1853, United States naval Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Tokyo Bay with his fleet of Black Ships and came ashore at Kurihama, in southern Yokosuka, leading to the opening of diplomatic and trade relations between Japan and the United States. The &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; sailed from Yokosuka in 1860 with the first Japanese diplomatic embassy to the United States in 1860.

During the turbulent Bakumatsu period, the Shogunate selected Yokosuka as the site for a modern naval base, and hired the French engineer Léonce Verny in 1865 to oversee the development of shipbuilding facilities, beginning with Yokosuka Iron Foundry. Yokosuka Naval Arsenal became the first modern arsenal to be created in Japan. The construction of the arsenal was the central point of a global modern infrastructure, that was to prove an important first step for the modernization of Japan&#x27;s industry. Modern buildings, the Hashirimizu waterway, foundries, brick factories, and technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established.

===Meiji period to present===

After the Meiji Restoration, the arsenal was taken over by the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the area of modern Yokosuka was reorganized into Uraga Town and numerous villages within Miura District, Kanagawa Prefecture. Yokosuka Village was elevated to town status in 1878 and was made the capital of Miura District. In 1889, the Yokosuka Line railway was opened, connecting Yokosuka to Yokohama and Tokyo. Yokosuka was elevated to city status on February 15, 1907. From 1916, Oppama in Yokosuka was developed as the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal, and many of the combat aircraft subsequently operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service were developed or tested at Yokosuka. Yokosuka Naval Arsenal also continued to expand in the early 20th century, and its production included battleships such as &quot;Yamashiro&quot;, and aircraft carriers such as &quot;Hiryū&quot; and &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. Smaller warships were constructed at the privately owned Uraga Dock Company. Yokosuka Naval District was the home port of the IJN 1st Fleet.

The Great Kantō earthquake of 1923 caused severe damage to Yokosuka, including the naval base which lost two years&#x27; operations of oil supplies. The city continued to expand in 1933 with the annexation of neighboring Kinugasa Village and Taura Town in 1933 and Kurihama Village in 1937. In 1943, the city also annexed the neighboring towns and villages of Uraga, Kitashitaura, Okusu, Nagai and Takeyama, as well as Zushi.

During World War II, Yokosuka was bombed on April 18, 1942, by American B-25 bombers in the Doolittle Raid with little damage as a retaliation to the attack on Pearl Harbor. Aside from minor sporadic tactical air raids by United States Navy aircraft, it was not bombed again during the war; however, from 1938 to 1945 more than 260 caves in more than 20 separate tunnel/cave networks were built throughout the area, with at least 27 kilometers of known tunnels within the grounds of Yokosuka Naval Base. Many more tunnels are scattered throughout the surrounding areas. During the war, these tunnels and caves provided areas in which work could be done in secrecy, safe from air attacks. A 500-bed hospital, a large electrical power generating facility, and a midget submarine factory and warehouse were among the many facilities built. American occupation forces landed at Yokosuka on August 30, 1945, after the surrender of Japan, and the naval base has been used by the US Navy since that time. The caves were used for storage and as an emergency shelter during the Korean War.

From the 1950s, United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka has been home port for the United States Seventh Fleet, and played a critical support role in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Yokosuka was the site of many anti-war protests during the late 1960s and 1970s. The nuclear-powered USS &quot;George Washington&quot;, formerly based at Yokosuka, was the first U.S. nuclear-powered ship that had been permanently based in Japan. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force also operates a military port next to the American base, as well as numerous training facilities at scattered locations around the city. For those reasons, there are a few hundred Americans and a thousand Filipinos in Yokosuka.

In 2001, Yokosuka was designated as a core city, with increased autonomy from the central government.

==Economy==
Aside from the economic impact of its various military facilities, Yokosuka is also an industrial city, with factories operated by Nissan Motors and its affiliated subsidiaries employing thousands of local residents. The Nissan Leaf, Nissan Cube, and Nissan Juke models are assembled in the in Yokosuka. The factory began operations in 1961 where the Nissan Bluebird was originally built. Every May, there is a festival celebrating Japanese curry, which draws 50,000 attendees each year. The plant is adjacent to Nissan&#x27;s Research and Development Center, the Oppama Proving Ground and the Oppama Wharf, from which Nissan ships vehicles made at Oppama and Nissan&#x27;s other two Japanese vehicle assembly plants to other regions of Japan and overseas.

The Yokosuka Research Park, established in 1997, is a major center for the Japanese telecommunications industry, and is where many of the wireless, mobile communications related companies have set up their research and development centers and joint testing facilities.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, Yokosuka&#x27;s population peaked around the year 1990 and has declined since then. Foreign citizens in Yokosuka are mainly Filipinos, Koreans, Chinese, and Americans.

==Education==
Yokosuka&#x27;s public elementary and junior high schools are operated by the Yokosuka Education System, a department of the Yokosuka City Department of Education. Many of Yokosuka&#x27;s public high schools, including Yokosuka High School, are operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education.

The city operates one municipal high school, Yokosuka Sogo High School.

==Energy disasters==
On 26 October 2011 Yokosuka held its annual nuclear accident evacuation drill. This drill was first held in 2008 when the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS &quot;George Washington&quot; was employed at the US naval base near this city. About 70 people, residents and firefighters took part in the drill. Firefighters ordered the residents of the city to stay indoors, assuming abnormally high levels of radiation around the US base. Radioactive contamination was controlled in the emergency response center by city officials. The US Navy refused to take part this, because of the supposed impossibility of radiation leaking outside the base. In December 2011, another drill was scheduled with Yokosuka and other cities to prepare for the possibility that people on board the ship might be exposed to radiation.

One unintended consequence of anti-nuclear sentiment is the construction of coal fired power plants, which causes air pollution and worsens global warming. As of 2020, two coal-fired power plants are proposed to be built in Yokosuka, even despite the climate emergency. These coal-fired power plants are being built without a full environmental review, and local residents are suing the government of Japan over its construction. Environment minister Shinjirō Koizumi has been &quot;a target of the activists&#x27; wrath&quot; because of his support for this project.

==Sister cities==
Yokosuka has twin-town relationships with four other cities. They are (in chronological order):
* Corpus Christi, Texas, United States, since 18 October 1962
* Brest, France, since 26 November 1970
* Fremantle, Western Australia, Australia, since 25 April 1979
* Medway, Kent, UK, since 26 August 1998
* Mazyr, Belarus, since 2008
* Bharatpur, Nepal, since 15 March 2023

Yokosuka has a friendship city relationship with one city:
* Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima, Japan, since 17 April 2005

==Local attractions==

Sarushima is an uninhabited island in the Tokyo Bay, accessible by ferry from Yokosuka.

The &quot;Mikasa&quot;, flagship of Admiral Togo at the Battle of Tsushima, built in Britain by Vickers, is preserved on dry land at Yokosuka. It is a museum, complete with actors dressed like members of the original crew, and can be visited for an entrance fee of 600 yen.

The Club Alliance enlisted club, which lies just inside the main gate of Yokosuka Naval Base, opened in 1983. It replaced the old Club Alliance which was demolished to make way for the Prince Hotel. The old Club Alliance is where Ryudo Uzaki got his start playing rock and roll. &quot;The Honch&quot;, a mecca for shopping and nightlife and located just outside the Yokosuka Naval Base&#x27;s main gates, is a popular attraction for tourists and sailors stationed nearby, as well as local Japanese residents.

The Yokosuka Arts Theatre, part of the Bay Square complex by Kenzō Tange, is a venue for opera, orchestral concerts, chamber music, and films.

Dobuita Street is situated in Yokosuka, close to the U.S. naval base. Therefore, this High Street has a very American influence, with many shops accepting U.S. dollars. In the evening the street turns into the local bar and club district for the area.

A museum in memory of rock musician Hide, a native of Yokosuka, opened on July 20, 2000. It has been reported that Japan&#x27;s former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, was influential in getting it built as he was a big fan of Hide&#x27;s band X Japan. The museum stayed open, past its original three-year plan, for five years, before closing on 25 September 2005.

Yokosuka is considered a place of origin of sukajan jackets. These embroidered satin bombers are a popular souvenir from the city, especially the more expensive, handmade ones.

==In popular culture==
Yokosuka, including Dobuita Street, is the setting for the 1999 video game &quot;Shenmue&quot;. Yokosuka is also depicted in the game&#x27;s anime adaptation. City officials cooperated with animators. The 2000 PlayStation game &quot;Front Mission 3&quot;, and Shohei Imamura&#x27;s 1961 New Wave film &quot;Pigs and Battleships&quot; take place in Yokosuka. Additionally, Yokosuka is the location of the climactic battle in the Godzilla film &quot;Terror of Mechagodzilla&quot;.

Yokosuka is a major location in the &quot;Arpeggio of Blue Steel&quot; franchise, where it serves as one of Japan&#x27;s few remaining naval facilities, the only one equipped with a functional shipyard and maritime academy. Due to rising sea levels, the port is built above the ruins of the submerged original city&#x27;s remains. All the main cast lived and attended school there before forming the privateer fleet &quot;Blue Steel&quot; that uses it as their home port.

<doc id="265511" wikidata="Q209609" url="?curid=265511" title="Broad-faced potoroo">
<text>The broad-faced potoroo (Potorous platyops) is an extinct potoroid marsupial that was found in southwestern Australia. The first specimen was collected in 1839, and described by John Gould in 1844. Only a small number of specimens have been collected since. The last live capture was in 1875. Subfossil remains indicate that it had an extensive distribution around the semiarid coastal districts of Southwest Australia.

The habitat of the broad-faced potoroo is almost entirely unknown, but unlike its relatives, such as the long-nosed potoroo &quot;Potorous tridactylus&quot; and long-footed &quot;Potorous longipes&quot;, they do not seem to have lived in dense understories in forests. Preserved specimens indicate that it was smaller than other potoroos at around 300 mm (1 ft) long with a 180-mm tail. Their weight is estimated at 800 g. Their coat was grizzled with yellowish hairs above and greyish white below. Their body was similar in shape to that of other potoroids. Their ears were small and rounded, muzzle fairly short, and cheeks notably puffy.

== Taxonomy ==
The first description was published by John Gould, using a specimen obtained by his collector John Gilbert at &quot;Walyema Swamps near Northam, Western Australia&quot;. Gilbert visited this inland region while collecting around the recently established Swan River Colony. The site he referred to was determined to be Lake Walyormouring.

The single specimen forwarded to Gould was presented to the Linnean Society of London, and the partial skull and skin of a female was deposited in the British Museum of Natural History. 
There were few collected after Gould&#x27;s initial description. There was one animal collected by James Drummond and recorded in a letter in the 1840s, the collector George Masters prepared four specimens in the 1860s, presumably when he made a large collection of taxa at Mordup. The last collection of living &quot;Potorous platyops&quot; was in 1874, collected by William Webb and are now held at the Macleay Museum in Sydney.

Curator and collector Hedley H. Finlayson described the remains of a potoroine animal found in a South Australian cave, which were similar to the &quot;Potorous platyops&quot;. However, the bones were retrieved from a site far from where the &quot;Potorous platyops&quot; was thought to be found, as well as the teeth being different from previously collections specimens. He ended up naming it as a new species, &quot;Potorous morgani&quot;. The specimen was later identified as a &quot;Potorous platyops&quot;. The skull that was studied and was held at a South Australian museum, amongst a deposit of multiple taxa from Kelly&#x27;s Hill Caves, which was collected by A.M. Morgan. The specific epithet &quot;morgani&quot; refers to the collector. Finlayson&#x27;s 1934 description recognised a close similarity to this species. When he obtained more specimens, which were collected at the same cave system on Kangaroo Island by Edith May, he obtained a second partial skull. Comparison of the dentition and other morphological characteristics was limited to works published by G. R. Waterhouse (1846), Oldfield Thomas (1888) and B. Arthur Bensley (1903) whose descriptions of &quot;P. platyops&quot; are recorded at the BMNH.

Common names include broad-faced potoroo and a name from the Nyungar language, &quot;moda&quot;, which was recorded by Gilbert and noted in Gould&#x27;s 1844 description as &quot;mor-da&quot;, and &quot;mort&quot; or &quot;moort&quot; by other ecologists writing shortly after its extinction. The name was obtained through an interview with Nyungar peoples at King George Sound by Gilbert. Early records show that it was also named the broad-faced rat kangaroo.

== Description ==

The broad-faced potoroo is a member of the genus &quot;Potorous&quot;. It is described as having a relatively broad skull and shorter muzzle.
The species is presumed to have become extinct sometime after the last recorded capture of the animal in 1875, and sometime before 1905.

The colour of the pelage is greyish brown at the upper-side. Straw-yellow hairs are interspersed through the fur to give a streaked effect. The underside and the flanks are pale grey. The head and body are about 305 millimetres in length, while the tail is about 178 mm long. Their hind feet are about 54 mm in length and their weight is approximately 800 grams. Their noses are short and blunt, which is an unusual characteristic among potorines and is usually associated with species such as the rufous bettong (&quot;Aepyprymnus rufescens&quot;) and the desert rat-kangaroo (&quot;Caloprymnus campestris&quot;).

== Ecology ==
The behaviour of the species has not been recorded, and nothing is known of its diet. The scant record of its habitat includes those provided by John Gilbert&#x27;s informants, one of whom said, &quot;All I could glean of its habits was that it was killed in a thicket surrounding one of the salt lagoons in the interior&quot;.

An assessment of documents prior to the 20th century concluded the only ecological change to affect the population were anecdotal reports of a &quot;disease&quot;, similar to one that had resulted in the sudden absence of similar species. A synthesis combining other historical evidence proposes what may have been an epizootic during the 1890s that precipitated their extinction.
No historical evidence could be found to link the conclusion of South African collector Guy C. Shortridge, writing in 1910, that ecological changes such as bushfire and the introduction of cats were directly linked to the species&#x27; decline.

Guy Shortridge searched extensively for this species on his collecting expedition near Bremer Bay, finding &quot;Potorous gilbertii&quot; skulls at caves near Margaret River, but could only provide the historical details of this species provided to him in his 1910 report. The information he reported—assumed to be from Nyungar informants—was that the species became extinct in 1905, were similar to the quokka in range and habits, and had been commonly found and often captured in large quantities. The remains were examined the following year, along with the remains of a dibbler, which was found along with the &quot;P. gilbertii&quot; remains in a deposit beneath a moving dune system. Another set of bones were found in an midden beneath a large peppermint (&quot;Agonis flexuosa&quot;), which was assumed to be the feeding roost of a predatory bird such as an owl. This site, near Hunter River, was partly preserved by a sand dune and included species introduced after the colonisation of Australia, possibly placing the date of these remains within recent history. Sub-fossil remains identified as &quot;P. platyops&quot; were also found in a survey of deposits on the Eyre Peninsula, accumulations that may have been middens of pre-colonial peoples of the region.

== Distribution ==
The few records of live specimens are restricted to Southwest Australia. The species could have already been near-extinct when Gilbert obtained his specimen, and no specific localities are known with any certainty.
Sub-fossil remains indicate a wide distribution range, extending from the southern to the western regions of Australia, including Nullarbor Plain, and perhaps as far north as the Northwest Cape region.
Remains have also been found on Kangaroo Island.

Some evidence indicates that &quot;P. platyops&quot;, like the desert-dwelling rat-kangaroo (&quot;Caloprymnus campestris&quot;), was already in decline when the invasive European rabbit became established in the species&#x27; former range.

<doc id="265516" wikidata="Q141017" url="?curid=265516" title="Tokyo Bay">
<text>is a bay located in the southern Kantō region of Japan spanning the coasts of Tokyo, Kanagawa Prefecture, and Chiba Prefecture. Tokyo Bay is connected to the Pacific Ocean by the Uraga Channel. The Tokyo Bay region is the most populous and the largest industrialized area in Japan.

==Names==
In ancient times, the Japanese knew Tokyo Bay as the . By the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600) the area had become known as after the city of Edo. The bay took its present name in modern times, after the Imperial court moved to Edo and renamed the city Tokyo in 1868.

==Geography==

Tokyo Bay juts prominently into the Kantō Plain. It is surrounded by the Bōsō Peninsula in Chiba Prefecture to the east and the Miura Peninsula in Kanagawa Prefecture to the west. The shore of Tokyo Bay consists of a diluvial plateau and is subject to rapid marine erosion. Sediments on the shore of the bay make for a smooth, continuous shoreline.

===Boundaries===
In a narrow sense, Tokyo Bay is the area north of the straight line from Cape Kannon on the west of Miura Peninsula to Cape Futtsu on the east Bōsō Peninsula. This area covers about in 2012, reclamation projects continue to slowly shrink the bay.

In a broader sense, Tokyo Bay includes the Uraga Channel. By this definition the bay opens from an area north of the straight line from Cape Tsurugisaki on the east of Miura Peninsula to Cape Sunosaki on the west of the Boso Peninsula. This area covers about . The area of Tokyo Bay combined with the Uraga Channel covers .

===Depth===
The shoal between Cape Futtsu in Chiba Prefecture and Cape Honmaku in Yokohama is known as Nakanose, and has a depth of . North of this area the bay has a depth of and an uncomplicated underwater topography. Areas south of Nakanose are significantly deeper moving towards the Pacific Ocean.

===Islands===
The only natural island in Tokyo Bay is Sarushima () at Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture. Sarushima was one of the locations fortified with coastal artillery during the Bakumatsu period and was subsequently incorporated into the Tokyo Bay Fortress during the Meiji period. The Imperial Japanese Navy maintained a degaussing station on the island until the end of World War II. The island is now uninhabited and is a marine park.

Many artificial islands were built as naval fortifications in the Meiji and Taishō periods. After World War II these islands were converted to residential or recreational use. Odaiba, also known as &quot;Daiba&quot;, was one of six artificial islands constructed in 1853 as a fortification to protect the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo, and was known as the Shinagawa Daiba. After World War II Odaiba was incorporated into Tokyo and redeveloped for commercial and recreational use. Before World War II, Yumenoshima was planned as an airfield (one of the largest in the world at the time), but after the US military expansion of Haneda Airport following World War II, the plan of the airfield fell through. The island briefly opened as a public beach before being repurposed and used as a landfill between 1957 and 1967 to dispose of the large quantities of garbage from the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The reclaimed land now hosts Yumenoshima Park with numerous recreational facilities. Hakkei Island (), formerly Landfill Number 14, was constructed in 1985 and is home to Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise. Other artificial islands include Heiwa, Katsushima, Shōwa, Keihin, and Higashiōgi islands.

===Rivers===
Numerous rivers empty into Tokyo Bay, and all provide water for residential and industrial areas along the bay. The Tama and Sumida rivers empty into the bay at Tokyo. The Edo River empties into Tokyo Bay between Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture. The Obitsu and Yōrō rivers empty into the bay in Chiba Prefecture.

===Land reclamation===
Land reclamation has been carried out along the coast of Tokyo Bay since the Meiji period. Areas along the shore with a depth of less than are simplest to carry out landfill, and sand from the floor of Tokyo Bay is used for these projects. The topography of the shoreline of Tokyo Bay differs greatly from that of the pre-modern period due to ongoing land reclamation projects. Tokyo Bay includes about of reclaimed land area in 2012. Aggregate household waste production is enormous in Greater Tokyo, there is little room for traditional garbage disposal sites; waste is rigorously sorted at the household, much of it is turned into ash and further recycled into bay landfill.

===Bridges===
The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line bridge-tunnel crosses Tokyo Bay between Kawasaki and Kisarazu; Tokyo-Wan Ferry also crosses the bay toward the Uraga Channel between Kurihama (in Yokosuka) and Kanaya (in Futtsu on the Chiba side).

==Development==

===Fishing===
Tokyo Bay was a historical center of the fishing industry, a source of shellfish, and other aquaculture. These industries decreased with the industrialization of the Tokyo Bay region early in the 20th century, and almost completely ceased with the construction of the Keihin and Keiyō industrial zones directly after World War II.

===Ports===
A number of Japan&#x27;s most important ports are located in Tokyo Bay. The Port of Yokohama, the Port of Chiba, the Port of Tokyo, the Port of Kawasaki, the Port of Yokosuka, the Port of Kisarazu, rank not only as the busiest ports in Japan, but also in the Asia-Pacific Region.

===Industrial zones===
Industrial zones on Tokyo Bay were developed as early as the Meiji era (1868–1912). The Keihin Industrial Zone was built on reclaimed land in Kanagawa Prefecture to the west of Tokyo. This was expanded to the Keiyō Industrial Zone in Chiba Prefecture along the north and east coasts of Tokyo Bay after World War II. The development of the two zones has resulted in the largest industrialized area in Japan. The large-scale industrial zones of the coastal Tokyo region have caused significant air and water pollution.

===Military facilities===
The Port of Yokosuka contains the naval bases of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and the United States Forces Japan.

==History==

===Perry Expedition===
Tokyo Bay was the venue for the Perry Expedition, which involved two separate trips from 1853 to 1854 between the United States and Japan by Commodore Matthew Perry (1794–1858). Perry sailed on his four &quot;Black Ships&quot; into Edo Bay on July 8, 1853, and began negotiations with the Tokugawa shogunate that led to a peace and trade treaty between the United States and Japan in 1854.

===World War II===
The Japanese Instrument of Surrender at the end of World War II was signed on September 2, 1945, on board , which was anchored at 35° 21′ 17″ N 139° 45′ 36″ E. A flag from one of Commodore Perry&#x27;s ships was flown in from the Naval Academy Museum and displayed at the ceremony.
