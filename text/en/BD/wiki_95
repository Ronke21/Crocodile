<text>Lollapalooza () is an annual American four-day music festival held in Grant Park in Chicago. It originally started as a touring event in 1991, and many years later, Chicago became its permanent location. Music genres include alternative rock, heavy metal, punk rock, hip hop, and electronic dance music. Lollapalooza has also featured visual arts, nonprofit organizations, and political organizations. The festival hosts an estimated 400,000 people each July and sells out annually. Lollapalooza is one of the largest music festivals in the world and one of the longest-running in the United States.

Lollapalooza was conceived and created in 1991 as a farewell tour by Perry Farrell, singer of the group Jane&#x27;s Addiction. The first Lollapalooza tour had a diverse collection of bands and was a commercial success. It stopped in more than twenty cities in North America. In 2020, &quot;Spin&quot; rated the first Lollapalooza as the best concert of the preceding 35 years. Lollapalooza then ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997 and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the organizers expanded the dates to two days per city but canceled the tour after poor ticket sales.

In 2005, Farrell and the William Morris Agency partnered with Austin, Texas–based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now C3 Presents) and retooled the event into its current format as an annual festival in Chicago. In 2014, Live Nation Entertainment bought a controlling interest in C3 Presents.

In 2010, it was announced that Lollapalooza would remain in Chicago, while also debuting outside the United States, with a branch of the festival staged in Santiago, Chile on April 2–3, 2011, where it partnered with Santiago-based company Lotus. In 2011, Geo Events confirmed the Brazilian version of the event, which was held at the Jockey Club in São Paulo on April 7–8, 2012. The Argentine version started in April 2014 in Buenos Aires and in November 2014, the first European Lollapalooza was announced, and was held at the former Berlin Tempelhof Airport.

==Etymology==
The word—sometimes alternatively spelled and pronounced as &quot;lollapalootza&quot;, &quot;lalapaloosa&quot;, or &quot;lallapaloosa&quot; (P. G. Wodehouse, &quot;The Heart of a Goof&quot;)—dates from a late 19th-century/early 20th-century American idiomatic phrase meaning &quot;an extraordinary or unusual thing, person, or event; an exceptional example or instance&quot;. Its earliest known use was in 1896. In time, the term also came to refer to a large lollipop. Farrell, searching for a name for his festival, liked the euphonious quality of the by-then-antiquated term, which he claimed he had heard in a Three Stooges short film, though a search of their catalog turned up nothing related. Paying homage to the term&#x27;s double meaning, a character in the festival&#x27;s original logo holds a lollipop.

==History==
===Creation===
Inspired by events such as Britain&#x27;s Reading Festival—which Lollapalooza cofounder Perry Farrell had been due to play in 1990—Farrell, Ted Gardner, Don Muller, and Marc Geiger conceived the festival in 1990 as a farewell for Farrell&#x27;s band Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

Unlike previous festivals such as Woodstock, A Gathering of the Tribes, and the US Festival, which were one-time events held at single venues, Lollapalooza toured across the United States and Canada from mid-July until late August 1991. The inaugural Lollapalooza lineup was diverse and made up of artists from alternative rock (such as Siouxsie and the Banshees who were the second headliners), industrial music (such as Nine Inch Nails), and rap (Ice-T rapped and used the platform to launch Body Count, his heavy metal band). The premiere in Phoenix, Arizona, on July 18, 1991, was covered by a report on MTV, which ended by journalist Dave Kendall saying &quot;Lollapalooza could be the tour of the summer&quot;. The tour ended at King County Fairgrounds in Enumclaw, Washington, near Seattle, on August 28, 1991.

Another key concept was the inclusion of nonmusical features. Performers such as the Jim Rose Circus Side Show, an alternative freak show, and the Shaolin monks stretched the boundaries of rock culture. There was a tent for display of art pieces, virtual reality games, and information tables for political and environmental nonprofit groups, promoting counterculture and political awareness. &quot;Basically, I&#x27;m bored&quot;, Farrell said at the time. &quot;I just want to see things that are unexpected and slightly bizarre. The way Barnum &amp; Bailey perceived putting on a show...well, they had a different angle.&quot;

===Success and decline===
The inaugural edition in 1991 was a surprise massive success. For Dave Grohl of Nirvana, who saw it in Los Angeles, the festival helped change the mentalities in the music industry. The Butthole Surfers opened the day, playing in front of a big audience, and Siouxsie and the Banshees &quot;were like the Led Zeppelin of that scene&quot;. &quot;It felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all&quot;. In an interview filmed on the opening day in Phoenix, rapper Ice-T stated: &quot;I know it is gonna be a tour people are gonna talk about for a long time&quot;. That year, Farrell also coined the term &quot;Alternative Nation&quot; when talking about the festival. In 2020, when rating the first edition as the greatest US tour in 35 years, &quot;Spin&quot; wrote that it &quot;changed the trajectory of the &#x27;90s, helping usher the alternative era into the mainstream. [...] Lollapalooza provided a common home for artists on the mainstream periphery. [...] Lolla became the template for what became the modern American festival.&quot;

The explosion of alternative rock in the early 1990s propelled Lollapalooza forward. However, MTV noted that the second edition was organized in a different way and included bands who had achieved commercial success. Journalist Kurt Loder commented: &quot;By 1992 the music that had once been trumpeted as alternative was quickly becoming mainstream and the second Lollapalooza reflected the shift. [...] The 1992 headliners included acts such as Soundgarden and Red Hot Chili Peppers, bands that were hardly strangers to the mainstream pop charts&quot;. The 1992 and 1993 festivals also leaned heavily on grunge and alternative acts, and usually featured an additional rap artist. Crowd behaviors prominent at punk rock concerts such as mosh pits and crowd surfing became regular parts of the shows. These years also saw marked increases in the participatory nature of the event, with the inclusion of booths for open-microphone readings and oratory, television-smashing pits, and tattoo and piercing parlors. After 1991, the festival included a second stage (and in 1996, a third) for up-and-coming bands or local acts. Attendee complaints of the festival included high ticket prices as well as the high cost for food and water at the shows. The event took place at the Alpine Valley festival in East Troy, Wisconsin on August 29, 1992, and also at World Music Theater in Tinley Park, Illinois (near Chicago), where concertgoers ripped up chunks of sod and grass and threw them at each other and at the bands, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in damages to the venue. The same summer, patrons at Great Woods in Mansfield, Massachusetts had torn up the venue&#x27;s fencing and burned it in bonfires throughout the show. The tour then relocated its New England stop to the naval yard at Quonset Point for two years, until Rhode Island officials vowed to keep it out, and in 1995, the tour returned to Great Woods.

Grunge band Nirvana was scheduled to headline at the festival in 1994, reportedly being offered nearly $10 million to do it. However, frontman Kurt Cobain turned it down, and the band officially dropped out of the festival on April 7, 1994. Cobain&#x27;s body was discovered in Seattle the next day. His widow, Courtney Love, made guest appearances at several shows, including the Philadelphia show at FDR Park (usually taking time given to her by the Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan), speaking to the crowds about the loss, then singing a minimum of two songs. Farrell worked with rock poster artist Jim Evans (T.A.Z.) to create a series of posters and the complete graphic decoration for the 1994 event, including two seventy-foot-tall Buddha statues that flanked the main stage.

In 1996, Farrell, who had been the soul of the festival, decided to focus his energy to produce his new festival project, ENIT, and did not participate in producing Lollapalooza. Many fans saw the addition of Metallica in 1996 as contrary to the festival&#x27;s prior practice of featuring &quot;non-mainstream&quot; artists, and described the crowds attracted by Metallica as being singularly focused on the headliner without respect for the other performing artists. Moreover, festival cofounder Farrell felt that Metallica&#x27;s macho image violated his peaceful vision for the festival, as the alternative culture of the early 1990s was generally against macho behavior. Farrell quit the tour in protest.

Responding to the controversial Metallica incident, Lollapalooza made efforts to revive its relevance to audiences. The festival booked eclectic acts such as country superstar Waylon Jennings in 1996, and emphasized heavily electronica groups such as the Orb and the Prodigy in 1997. 1997, however, would prove to be the final tour from the initial series of Lollapalooza events. The festival failed to find a suitable headliner in 1998 and therefore announced Lollapalooza&#x27;s cancellation. The cancellation served as a signifier of alternative rock&#x27;s declining popularity. In light of the festival&#x27;s troubles that year, &quot;Spin&quot; magazine said, &quot;Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now.&quot;

===Revival===
In 2003, Farrell reconvened Jane&#x27;s Addiction and scheduled a new Lollapalooza tour. The festival schedule included venues in thirty cities through July and August. The 2003 tour achieved only marginal success, with many fans staying away, presumably because of high ticket prices. Another tour scheduled for 2004 was to consist of a two-day festival taking place in each city. Despite a bill with Morrissey, Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, Pixies, and the Flaming Lips as headliners, the 2004 edition was canceled in June due to weak ticket sales across the country. In 2005, Farrell partnered with Capital Sports &amp; Entertainment (now C3 Presents), which co-owns and produces the Austin City Limits Music Festival, to produce Lollapalooza. CSE, Farrell, and the William Morris Agency—along with Charles Attal Presents—resurrected Lollapalooza as a two-day destination festival in 2005 in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park, with an even greater variety of performers (70 acts on five stages) than that of the touring festival. The event was generally successful, attracting over 65,000 attendees, despite a 104-degree Fahrenheit Sunday (40 degrees Celsius) heat wave (two people were hospitalized for heat-related illness).

It returned to Chicago on August 4–6, 2006. On October 25, 2006, the Chicago Park District and Capital Sports &amp; Entertainment agreed to a five-year, $5 million deal, keeping Lollapalooza at Grant Park in Chicago until 2011. Lollapalooza ran August 3–5 in 2007; August 1–3, 2008; August 7–9, 2009; August 6–8, 2010; August 5–7, 2011; August 3–5, 2012; August 2–4, 2013; and August 1–3, 2014. After a successful 2008 festival, another deal was signed to keep Lollapalooza in Chicago through 2018, guaranteeing the city $13 million.

The 2016 iteration of the event was four days long, from July 28 to 31, to celebrate the event&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

The 2020 experience of the festival was initially scheduled to occur July 30 – August 2. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was officially canceled on June 9. The festival postponed the sale of tickets in March as a precaution to the possible shutdown of live music events. In order to keep the spirit of the festival going, the city of Chicago announced that they would offer a livestreamed event occurring the same weekend as the initially-planned event. The livestreamed version featured acts such as A$AP Rocky, Brockhampton, Lupe Fiasco, Outkast, and many more performing on a free YouTube broadcast.

On May 18, 2021, festival organizers and the City of Chicago announced that Lollapalooza would return at full capacity from July 29 to August 2, 2021. In May 2022, it was announced that Hulu would exclusively stream the festival, alongside Austin City Limits and Bonnaroo.

==Festival tickets and pricing==
Tickets to the flagship and original Lollapalooza edition, in Chicago, usually sold out extremely quickly. For the 2016 event, the four-day general passes sold out in about one day after the sale began. The one-day passes sold even more quickly: they were gone less than three hours after organizers revealed the lineup for the four-day music festival. Because of this phenomenon, people who cannot buy the passes try to get them through alternatives sources such as Craigslist and StubHub. This is a common practice, although the prices tend to be significantly higher on these websites. In 2018, the festival experienced unusually slower sales, so they released the lineup about eight hours earlier.

In its earliest editions, the official passes cost $31.50. However, with its growth and prominent relevance in the music world, Lollapalooza pass prices have increased substantially over the years. Comparing the weekend passes for Lollapalooza 2016, which cost $335, with the ones for Lollapalooza 2015, at $275, the increase was more than 20%. The price for weekend passes from 2016 to 2018 remained the same. In 2020, a slight increase of five dollars was added to weekend passes, making them $340.

==Spin-off events==
===Kidzapalooza===
Originally thought of by music producer Tor Hyams, Kidzapalooza was the idea for a more child-centered experience to the adult Lollapalooza. Hyams came to Perry Farrell with the idea in 2005, and later that year the event first appeared in Chicago. Kidzapalooza has been a success and appeared alongside every Lollapalooza since its original debut in 2005. The event includes many different events for children to enjoy such as game, design, and art stations where children can express their creativity. Musical instruments are set up for children to play and experience in another station of the venue. Raffles and various other amenities are available to the children as well. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 installation of Kidzapalooza was canceled. Kidzapalooza has sprouted to other venues taking interest, such as the Hollywood Bowl hosting its own Kidzapalooza in 2008 as a stand-alone event.

===PurimPalooza===
Another play on the Lollapalooza name, PurimPalooza is a celebration of Purim, a Jewish holiday. The celebration includes traditional Purim practices such as a commemoratory meal, attendees dressing up in costume, and a public reading of the Scroll of Esther. The night is followed up by less traditional Purim practices, with the addition of live music, by primarily Jewish artists, and drinking for those of age. In 1999, Farrell himself performed at PurimPalooza, hosted by Rabbi Josef Langer, at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. Again in 2006, Farrell performed at PurimPalooza, hosted at the Ruby Skye in San Francisco, which featured artists such as Matisyahu and Chutzpah.

==International expansion==
===Chile===
In 2010, it was announced that Lollapalooza would debut in South America, with a branch of the festival staged in Chile&#x27;s capital Santiago on April 2–3, 2011. The Lollapalooza Chile lineup included Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Thirty Seconds to Mars, The National, Manny and Gil The Latin, The Drums, The Killers, Los Bunkers, Ana Tijoux, Javiera Mena, Fatboy Slim, Deftones, Los Plumabits, Cypress Hill, 311, The Flaming Lips, and many others. The eighth edition in Chile was held on March 16–18, 2018, with Pearl Jam, Lana Del Rey, The Killers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and LCD Soundsystem as headliners. In October 2022, the lineup for the following year&#x27;s event was announced and is set to include headliners Blink-182, Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X, Drake, Rosalía, and Tame Impala.

===Brazil===
A Brazilian version of the event was confirmed in 2011, and had its inaugural edition at the in São Paulo on April 7–8, 2012. In the following year, Lollapalooza was again held at Jockey Club during Holy Week, this time expanding to three days that filled the whole Paschal Triduum—March 29–31, 2013. The third edition was moved to the Autódromo José Carlos Pace in São Paulo&#x27;s borough of Interlagos, happening on April 5 and 6, 2014. Interlagos remained the festival&#x27;s home for the following editions, on March 28–29, 2015, March 12–13, 2016, March 25–26, 2017, March 23–25, 2018, and April 5–7, 2019. The 2020 edition was supposed to happen in April 3–5, with headliners Guns N&#x27; Roses, Travis Scott, and the Strokes, but was canceled a week before the planned dates due to COVID-19 lockdowns. The festival was rescheduled to December 4–6 of the same year, maintaining the same headliners, but was, once again, shut down due to COVID. It was again rescheduled to September 10–12, 2021 due to continued COVID restrictions, this time not confirming its headliners or other attractions. After two years of expectations, the festival was rescheduled for a fourth time, to March 25–27, 2022. The festival finally returned in March 2022 on the scheduled dates, with headliners The Strokes and Miley Cyrus. Foo Fighters were supposed to close the event on March 27, but their drummer, Taylor Hawkins, died two days before the event, while touring South America. The band was replaced with various Brazilian artists paying tribute to the musician.

The 2023 Brazilian version of the festival took place from March 24 to 26. Announced headliners were Billie Eilish, Blink-182, and Drake. Blink-182 cancelled a few weeks before the event due to drummer Travis Barker injuring his hand. The band was replaced by Twenty One Pilots. Drake also cancelled his performance hours before he was scheduled to go onstage, causing commotion online as he was seen at an American club the night before; he was replaced by Skrillex.

The 2024 edition happened on March 22–24, with Blink-182, SZA, Kings of Leon, Sam Smith, Arcade Fire, Limp Bizkit, and Titãs headlining. Kings of Leon were replacements for Paramore, who canceled just two months before the festival.

The 2025 edition is scheduled for March 28–30, headlined by Olivia Rodrigo, Rüfüs Du Sol, Shawn Mendes, Alanis Morissette, Justin Timberlake, and Tool.

===Argentina===
On September 10, 2013, it was announced that the Argentine version of the festival would be held in Buenos Aires. Since then, Lollapalooza has had an annual edition at the Hipódromo de San Isidro, usually in the last week of March.

===Germany===
On November 4, 2014, it was announced that the first European Lollapalooza would be held in the German capital of Berlin. It was scheduled for September 12–13, 2015, and the proposed location was the historical airport grounds of Berlin-Tempelhof. In the official press release, festival founder Perry Farrell stated that, &quot;Berlin&#x27;s energy, vibrant art, fashion and music scenes are a mirror reflection of what Lollapalooza is all about and I can&#x27;t wait to share in this cultural exchange&quot;. Lollapalooza Germany was produced by the Lollapalooza U.S. team, in addition to Melt! Booking and Festival Republic, who have helped run both Reading and Leeds festivals in England. The 2016 edition of the event took place in the Treptower Park in Berlin, on September 10–11. It drew 70,000 visitors each day.

At change.org, an online petition against the festival in the Treptower Park gathered over 6,400 supporters. Citizens from the area created working groups to stop the festival taking place, due to noise and other complaints.

Since 2018, the festival has been held at the Olympiapark Berlin.

===Sweden===
The first Scandinavian edition of Lollapalooza was held in the Swedish capital of Stockholm, on June 28–30, 2019. After being canceled for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Lollapalooza returned to Stockholm on July 1–3, 2022. The 2022 event was attended by over 70,000 people, making it the biggest Swedish festival of all time.

===France===
On October 12, 2016, Lollapalooza announced that they would be hosting a festival in Paris, France. The inaugural edition of the event took place at the city&#x27;s Longchamp Racecourse grounds on July 22–23, 2017. The lineup for Lollapalooza Paris 2017 was announced on January 17, 2017, and included Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Weeknd as headliners. Following that, the lineup included the likes of Imagine Dragons, Lana Del Rey, DJ Snake, London Grammar, Alt-J, The Roots, Marshmello, Liam Gallagher, Martin Solveig, Skepta, Glass Animals, Milky Chance, Don Diablo, Oliver Heldens, Crystal Fighters, Jauz, Alan Walker, and many more. Since then, the festival has taken place in France every year, except for 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2024, when it was canceled due to logistical, administrative, and security constraints.

===Israel===
On August 7, 2012, Perry Farrell announced that Lollapalooza would be debuting in Tel Aviv, Israel. Farrell described Israel as an &quot;international music community that listens to everything we all listen to, but the artists weren&#x27;t traveling there so it was an opportunity.&quot; The event was scheduled for August 20–22, 2013 in Yarkon Park, the city&#x27;s largest urban park. However, the event was postponed to an unspecified date. While there was no definitive reason for the cancellation of the Israel date, various news sources reported financial challenges associated with producing a large-scale show with international artists within the political situation in the Middle East.

===India===
On July 27, 2022, Lollapalooza announced that they would be debuting at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse in Mumbai, India on January 28–29, 2023. This would be Lollapalooza&#x27;s first event in Asia, partnering with BookMyShow. The headliners of the two-day event were Imagine Dragons, the Strokes, and Diplo. The lineup included nearly forty artists, such as Cigarettes After Sex, Raveena, Greta Van Fleet, Japanese Breakfast, the Wombats, Jackson Wang, and AP Dhillon.

==Criticism==
Recording engineer, guitarist, and journalist Steve Albini has criticized Lollapalooza for its corporatization of popularized &quot;alternative&quot; music. In a 1993 interview, Albini commented:

 Lollapalooza is the worst example of corporate encroachment into what is supposed to be the underground. It is just a large scale marketing of bands that pretend to be alternative but are in reality just another facet of the mass cultural exploitation scheme. I have no appreciation or affection for those bands and I have no interest in that whole circle. If Lollapalooza had Jesus Lizard and the Melvins and Fugazi and Slint then you could make a case that it was actually people on the vanguard of music. What it really is is the most popular bands on MTV that are not heavy metal.

Both the Jesus Lizard and Melvins have subsequently performed at the event.

In April 2010, it was reported that Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan had launched an antitrust investigation into the festival for imposing radius clauses on acts, contractually stipulating that they could not perform in cities within 300 miles of Chicago—including cities as far as Detroit, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee—for up to six months prior, and three months after Lollapalooza. The investigation was closed in 2012, with no action taken.

<text>Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR) is a record label set up in 1994 by Alec Empire, Joel Amaretto and Pete Lawton. Most of the music is recorded in Berlin, though the label is based in London where the records are mastered and manufactured. The funds for setting up the label came from the payment which Atari Teenage Riot received for their aborted record deal with the major UK record label Phonogram Records.

The label is acclaimed for its articulation of the digital hardcore style of music: &quot;digital hardcore&quot; is used not only to refer to the record label itself, but to the genre that its artists helped to create. Several artists to this day, though not affiliated with the DHR label, would classify themselves as digital hardcore, tangible proof of DHR&#x27;s solid influence on the industrial/electronic scene as well as on the rock/metal-scene.

In 1995 DHR released its first album (they had previously only released a 12&quot; in 1994) and a compilation, &quot;Harder Than The Rest&quot;. Digital Hardcore Festival events were held in several German cities, and the Suicide Club in Berlin, run by a friend of ATR, provided a platform to new bands such as EC8OR. The word about DHR spread to underground scenes in Japan, USA, Australia and Europe. BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel heard about DHR and invited Atari Teenage Riot to play in London.

In 1996 DHR made a distribution deal for the US on the Beastie Boys&#x27; Grand Royal label then DHR toured there and South East Asia. Atari Teenage Riot toured in support of bands such as Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Beck, Rage Against the Machine and Wu-Tang Clan. In 1997 Atari Teenage Riot, Shizuo and Ec8or embarked on a Digital Hardcore tour of the United States.

In 1998 DHR established an office in New York City and its studios in Berlin. In the ensuing years Atari Teenage Riot came under a lot of pressure, amongst other reasons because of member Carl Crack&#x27;s psychosis (and subsequent death). By 2000 the Berlin music scene in which DHR had found its place was declining, Atari Teenage Riot disbanded and no new groups or artists were being signed to DHR. At the end of that year Alec Empire decided to restructure DHR and began work on a new album.

In 2002 Empire released &quot;Intelligence and Sacrifice&quot; and played shows in the US. He became aware of the growing digital hardcore scene there, releasing a compilation of American bands on DHR entitled &quot;Don’t Fuck With Us!&quot;

Although at present the label is seen as less influential than it was in the 1990s, DHR is nevertheless recognised for its role in the emergence of breakcore, as well as promoting music its artists believed in.

<doc id="270632" wikidata="Q2915067" url="?curid=270632" title="Elevenses">
<text>Elevenses () is a short break taken at around 11:00a.m. to consume a drink or snack. The names and details vary among countries.

==Regional variations==

===Australia and New Zealand===
Australia and New Zealand have &quot;morning tea&quot; that occurs at approximately 10:30a.m. This is often a break from work that is formally codified into some workplace agreements. It is standard practice for schools to have a morning tea recess for students, which may be colloquially known as little lunch. Many workplaces organize an event or celebration during morning tea in order to welcome new employees, farewell colleagues who are leaving, to recognise special occasions such as birthdays, or simply as a regular social event for staff. 

Farmers, shearers and tradespeople in both countries often refer to this mid-morning break as a smoko. 

===Belgium===
In Flemish, this type of snack is called &quot;&quot;tienuurtje&quot;, . A &quot;tienuurtje&quot; typically consists of one or more cookies or some piece of fruit and may be accompanied by fruit juice or chocolate milk. Many parents give their children a &quot;tienuurtje&quot; to eat during the mid-morning school break.
A similar type of snack for the afternoon break is called &quot;vieruurtje&quot;&quot;, .

===Chile===
In Chile, elevenses is observed under the name &quot;las once&quot; or &quot;la once&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;once&quot; means &#x27;eleven&#x27;). However, in Chile it has shifted to the afternoon, sometimes replacing the traditional dinner.

In the 2010–2011 National Food Consumption Survey, around 80% of the Chileans reported having &quot;once&quot;. This is due to &quot;once&quot; sometimes replacing the traditional dinner in Chile, which only 30% of the population reported having. Here, traditional dinner means a proper meal with vegetables, meat, poultry and fish. &quot;La once&quot; resembles a light version of British High Tea.

An alternative widespread, but unfounded, popular etymology for the word in Chile is that priests (in other versions, workers or women) used the phrase &quot;tomar las once&quot; (Spanish: &#x27;drink the eleven&#x27;) in reference to the eleven letters of the word &quot;Aguardiente&quot; to conceal the fact that they were drinking during the day.

===Colombia===
In Colombia, it is common to have a snack named &quot;onces&quot;. It consists mainly of hot chocolate or coffee with arepa, bread, or crackers, usually taken around 5:00 pm. In the morning, the snack consist of the same type of food but it is called &quot;medias nueves&quot;. It is served generally between 9:00 and 11:00a.m.

===Germany===
In Germany, 10:30a.m. is a popular time for workers who started early (like craftspeople, builders, …) to eat a snack. Most people nowadays will attribute German self-awareness of this to an advertisement for &quot;Knoppers&quot;, a type of candy, with the saying &quot;Morgens, halb Zehn, in Deutschland…&quot; (&quot;In the morning, 9:30, in Germany…&quot;), that had become its own meme. But in reality, since those workers work harder, the most common snacks include bread rolls with meat, e.g. &quot;Mettbrötchen&quot; (raw pork mince), &quot;Leberkäse&quot; (comparable to trick baloney), Schnitzel, three small sausages (Wiener or &quot;Nürnberger&quot;), etc., all preferably warm; or just cold cuts.

===Hungary===
Elevenses in Hungarian is called &quot;tízórai&quot;, which translates to &#x27;of the 10o&#x27;clock&#x27;, referring to &quot;the meal of the 10o&#x27;clock&quot;. This is a break between breakfast and lunch, when it is time for a light meal or snack. In schools the early lunch break is called &quot;tízórai&quot;. Parallel to the word &quot;elevenses&quot;, &quot;tízórai&quot; is often called Tenses &quot;Tenzeez&quot; by Hungarian-Americans and Hungarian-Britons.

===India===
In certain parts of rural India, especially in northern states, such as Punjab, it is normal practice to take tea break two or three hours after breakfast. When the practice began, there was no set clock and break was usually between 10–11a.m., so as in other countries it was named after the approximate time; &quot;Das-Baja&quot;, meaning &#x27;10o&#x27;clock tea&#x27;.

The practice is slowly becoming obsolete in cities and towns, especially in professional jobs, but in rural areas such breaks for manual and agricultural labourers are still very popular.

===Israel===
In Israel it is called ארוחת עשר (&quot;arukhat eser&quot;, Hebrew for &#x27;10o&#x27;clock meal&#x27;), mostly eaten at schools and kindergartens in the form of homemade sandwiches, often accompanied with a fruit or other snack, after the second hour of the school day and before the so-called &quot;small break&quot;. It also occurs in major unionized workplaces, such as factories and customer services reception centres, where workers are handed tea.

===Netherlands===
In West Friesland country people had a similar meal called &quot;konkelstik&quot; (served at &quot;konkeltiid&quot;, the proper time for &quot;konkelen&quot;, a verb denoting &quot;making a visit&quot;).

===Poland===
In Poland the &quot;drugie śniadanie&quot; () is eaten in the midmorning. Rather than a heavy chunk of sausage or other meat, though, like the German second breakfast, Poles prefer a lighter, dessert-like pastry or sweet with a hot drink, more similar to the American &quot;coffee break&quot;.

===Slovakia===
In Slovakia, &quot;desiata&quot; (, from &quot;tenth hour&quot;) can be eaten at or around 10a.m.. It usually consists of a small snack, fruit, or a sandwich, i.e. a lighter meal, so as not to fill the stomach before lunch. In schools, the break between classes around 10a.m. is referred to as &quot;desiatová prestávka&quot; () and may be a few minutes longer than other breaks, to give the students time to eat their &quot;desiata&quot;. Note: although the word &quot;desiata&quot; is grammatically an ordinal numeral, it is treated as a noun in this context.

===Spain===
In Spain it is not rare to have a short meal break around 11:00a.m., particularly in jobs of intense physical activity; this can range from a hot drink paired with light snacks like pastries to a sandwich, scrambled eggs or a piece of Spanish omelette (also known as a &quot;pincho&quot;). This meal is sometimes known as &quot;almuerzo&quot;, although this word is used inconsistently and mostly just means &#x27;lunch&#x27;. Also note lunch time in Spain can be as late as 3:00p.m., which conditions mid-morning customs.

In the Basque Country, in particular, it is common to have a mid-morning snack consisting of high-protein food like eggs, bacon, or cured meat on bread, called &quot;&quot;hamarretako&quot; () or &quot;hamaiketako&quot;&quot; ().

===Sweden===
In Sweden, it is common to drink coffee at 11:00a.m., &quot;elvakaffe&quot; (), often with a few biscuits or a light sandwich.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, there is a &quot;Znüni&quot; (&#x27;(Meal) at nine&#x27;, following the nomenclature of Breakfast (&quot;Zmorge&quot;), Lunch (&quot;Zmittag&quot;), afternoon snack at four (&quot;Zvieri&quot;) and Dinner (&quot;Znacht&quot;)). The name, despite referring to a specific time, stays the same no matter the actual time of the snack break; especially in schools, it is usually at 10:00a.m..

===United Kingdom===

Elevenses, eaten at 11:00a.m. as the name suggests, typically consists of tea or coffee, often with a few biscuits. Sometimes, cake or other snacks are eaten instead.

===United States===
During the first decades of the 19th century, elevenses consisted of drinking whiskey. In modern times, hourly workers take a break known as a coffee break, typically around 10:00a.m., or in the first third of a work shift. Often, this is done in a break room, and small snacks may be eaten as well.

It is common for school children to have a short snack break, called &quot;morning snack&quot;. This is offered in the morning before lunch, usually between 9:00 and 11:00a.m. In Wisconsin and some other Midwestern states, this break is called &quot;milk break&quot; with students served a small carton of milk.

==In popular culture==
For elevenses, Winnie-the-Pooh preferred honey on bread with condensed milk.

Paddington Bear often took elevenses at the antique shop on Portobello Road run by his friend Mr Gruber, for which Paddington would buy buns and Mr Gruber would make cocoa.

In the Middle-earth stories by J. R. R. Tolkien (&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;), elevenses is one of the many meals that is enjoyed by the Hobbits of the Shire, served daily between second breakfast and luncheon. In addition, a party is implied to be particularly lavish in that food was served &quot;continuously from elevenses until six-thirty&quot;.

In &quot;Fireman Sam&quot;, Dilys Price regularly took elevenses at Bella Lasagne&#x27;s café.

<doc id="270634" wikidata="Q748878" url="?curid=270634" title="Dhammapada">
<text>The Dhammapada (; ) is a collection of sayings of the Buddha in verse form and one of the most widely read and best known Buddhist scriptures. The original version of the Dhammapada is in the Khuddaka Nikaya, a division of the Pali Canon of Theravada Buddhism.

The Buddhist scholar and commentator Buddhaghosa explains that each saying recorded in the collection was made on a different occasion in response to a unique situation that had arisen in the life of the Buddha and his monastic community. His translation of the commentary, the &quot;Dhammapada Atthakatha&quot;, presents the details of these events and is a rich source of legend for the life and times of the Buddha.

==Etymology==
The title &quot;Dhammapada&quot; is a compound term composed of &quot;dhamma&quot; and &quot;pada&quot;, each word having a number of denotations and connotations. Generally, &quot;dhamma&quot; can refer to the Buddha&#x27;s &quot;doctrine&quot; or an &quot;eternal truth&quot; or &quot;righteousness&quot; or all &quot;phenomena&quot;; at its root, &quot;pada&quot; means &quot;foot&quot; and thus by extension, especially in this context, means either &quot;path&quot; or &quot;verse&quot; (cf. &quot;prosodic foot&quot;) or both. English translations of this text&#x27;s title have used various combinations of these and related words.

== History ==
According to tradition, the Dhammapada&#x27;s verses were spoken by the Buddha on various occasions. Glenn Wallis states: &quot;By distilling the complex models, theories, rhetorical style and sheer volume of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings into concise, crystalline verses, the Dhammapada makes the Buddhist way of life available to anyone...In fact, it is possible that the very source of the Dhammapada in the third century B.C.E. is traceable to the need of the early Buddhist communities in India to laicize the ascetic impetus of the Buddha&#x27;s original words.&quot; The text is part of the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Sutta Pitaka, although over half of the verses exist in other parts of the Pali Canon. A 4th or 5th century CE commentary attributed to Buddhaghosa includes 305 stories which give context to the verses.

* Pāli Dhammapada – the oldest available manuscripts date to 1500 CE. A compiler is not named.

Although the Pāli edition is the best-known, a number of other versions are known:
* &quot;Gāndhārī Dharmapada&quot; – a version possibly of Dharmaguptaka or Kāśyapīya origin in Gāndhārī written in Kharosthi script
* &quot;Patna Dharmapada&quot; – a version in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, most likely of the Sāmatiya sect
* &quot;Udānavarga&quot; – a seemingly related Mula-Sarvastivada or Sarvastivada text in
** 3 Sanskrit versions
** a Tibetan translation, which is popular in traditional Tibetan Buddhism
* &quot;Mahāvastu&quot; – a Lokottaravāda text with parallels to verses in the Pāli Dhammapada&#x27;s &quot;Sahassa Vagga&quot; and &quot;Bhikkhu Vagga&quot;.
* &quot;FaJuJing 法句经&quot; – 4 Chinese works; one of these appears to be an expanded translation of the Pali version; this has not traditionally been very popular.
** The &quot;Faju jing –&quot; translated and compiled by Weizhinan in 224 CE
** The &quot;Faju piyu jing –&quot; compiled by Faju and Fali between 290-306 CE
** The &quot;Chuyao jing&quot; &quot;–&quot; translated by Zhu Fonian in 383 CE
** The &quot;Faju yaosong jing&quot; &quot;–&quot; translated by Tianxizai between 980-999 CE

Comparing the Pali Dhammapada, the Gandhari Dharmapada and the Udanavarga, Brough (2001) identifies that the texts have in common 330 to 340 verses, 16 chapter headings and an underlying structure. He suggests that the three texts have a &quot;common ancestor&quot; but underlines that there is no evidence that any one of these three texts might have been the &quot;primitive Dharmapada&quot; from which the other two evolved.

The Dhammapada is one of the most popular pieces of Theravada literature. A critical edition of the Dhammapada in Latin was produced by Danish scholar Viggo Fausbøll in 1855, becoming the first Pali text to receive this kind of examination by the European academic community.

== Organization ==
The Pali Dhammapada contains 423 verses in 26 chapters (listed in Pali and English):

Many of the themes within the Dhammapada are dichotomous. For example, contrasts between joy and suffering, virtuous action and misconduct, and truth and deceit recur throughout the text.

== Excerpts ==
The following Pali verses and corresponding English translations are from Ānandajoti (2017), which also contains explanatory footnotes.

<text>Ailurinae is a subfamily of Ailuridae (of which this is the only extant subfamily out of three). While it is represented by the extant genus &quot;Ailurus&quot;, there were a handful of genera whose fossils have been found across the Holarctic region. These include the Middle Miocene &quot;Magerictis&quot; of Spain, the Early Pliocene &quot;Pristinailurus&quot; of the United States of America and their sister taxon &quot;Parailurus&quot; of Eurasia and North America in the Pliocene. Unlike &quot;Ailurus&quot; which is a specialized arboreal bamboo forager, the extinct ailurine species were more generalized and spent their time foraging on the ground.

<text>A spectator sport is a sport that is characterized by the presence of spectators, or watchers, at its competitions. Spectator sports may be professional sports or amateur sports. They often are distinguished from participant sports, which are more recreational.

==Overview==
Most popular sports are both spectator and participant, for example association football, basketball, cricket, tennis, rugby, golf, athletics and volleyball. Less popular sports are mainly participant sports, for example hunting.

The increasing broadcasting of sports events, along with media reporting can affect the number of people attending sports due to the ability to experience the sport without the need to physically attend and sometimes an increasingly enhanced experience including highlights, replays, commentary, statistics and analysis. Some sports are particularly known as &quot;armchair sports&quot; or &quot;lounge room sports&quot; due to the quality of the broadcasting experience in comparison to the live experience.

Spectator sports have built their own set of culture and traditions including, in the United States, cheerleading, team mascots, and pre-game and half time entertainment such as fireworks, particularly for big games such as competition decider events and international tests. The passion of some sports fans also means that there are occasionally spectator incidents.

The North American Society for Sport Management (NASSM) devotes much of their annual conference to research addressing the psychology behind a desire to view spectator sports, and how it might be leveraged to increase demand. Much of the research focuses on exploiting a need for vicarious achievement, and a desire within the spectator to project a public image through a declaration of team allegiance.

Separation of the active and the passive, the line between sport and spectator, gives rise to the paradox of the spectator—described by French philosopher Jacques Rancière—which is to seek an opportunity to passively contemplate engaging in an activity, and in doing so, forfeit that life moment one might have used to actually engage in the activity.

<text>Sterling (ISO code: GBP) is the currency of the United Kingdom and nine of its associated territories. The pound (sign: £) is the main unit of sterling, and the word &quot;pound&quot; is also used to refer to the British currency generally, often qualified in international contexts as the British pound or the pound sterling.

Sterling is the world&#x27;s oldest currency in continuous use since its inception. In 2022, it was the fourth-most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market, after the United States dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen. Together with those three currencies and the renminbi, it forms the basket of currencies that calculate the value of IMF special drawing rights. As of late 2022, sterling is also the fourth most-held reserve currency in global reserves.

The Bank of England is the central bank for sterling, issuing its own banknotes and regulating issuance of banknotes by private banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Sterling banknotes issued by other jurisdictions are not regulated by the Bank of England; their governments guarantee convertibility at par. Historically, sterling was also used to varying degrees by the colonies and territories of the British Empire.

==Names==
===Etymology===

There are various theories regarding the origin of the word &quot;sterling&quot;. &quot;The Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states that the &quot;most plausible&quot; etymology is a derivation from the Old English for &quot;star&quot; with the added diminutive suffix , to yield &quot;little star&quot;. The reference is to the silver penny used in Norman England in the twelfth century, which bore a small star.

Another theory holds that the Hanseatic League was the origin of its definition, manufacture, and name: the German name for the Baltic is () and from this the Baltic merchants were called (). In 1260, Henry III granted them a charter of protection and land for their kontor, the Steelyard of London, which by the 1340s was also called (). Because the League&#x27;s money was not frequently debased like that of England, English traders stipulated to be paid in pounds of the &quot;Easterlings&quot;, which was contracted to &quot;&#x27;sterling&quot;. The OED dismisses this theory as unlikely, since the stressed first syllable would not have been elided.

Encyclopædia Britannica states that the (pre-Norman) Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had silver coins called &quot;sterlings&quot; and that the compound noun &quot;pound sterling&quot; was derived from a pound (weight) of these sterlings.

The English word &quot;pound&quot; derives from the Latin expression , in which is a noun meaning &#x27;pound&#x27; and is a noun, in the ablative case, meaning &#x27;by weight&#x27;.

===Symbol===

The currency sign for the pound unit of sterling is , which (depending on typeface) may be drawn with one or two bars: the Bank of England has exclusively used the single bar variant since 1975. Historically, a simple capital (in the historic black-letter typeface, formula_1) placed before the numerals, or an italic &quot;l.&quot; after them, was used in newspapers, books and letters. The Royal Mint was still using this style of notation as late as 1939. The glyphs and may occasionally be encountered. Use of the letter for pound derives from medieval Latin documents: &quot;L&quot; was the abbreviation for , the Roman pound (weight), which in time became an English unit of weight defined as the tower pound. A &quot;pound sterling&quot; was literally a tower pound (weight) of sterling silver. In the British pre-decimal (duodecimal) currency system, the term £sd (or Lsd) for pounds, shillings and pence referred to the Roman , &quot;solidus&quot;, and &quot;denarius&quot;.

Notable style guides recommend that the pound sign be used without any abbreviation or qualification to indicate sterling (e.g., £12,000). The ISO 4217 code &quot;GBP&quot; (e.g., GBP 12,000) may also be seen should disambiguation become necessary.

===Currency code===
The ISO 4217 currency code for sterling is &quot;GBP&quot;, formed from the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the United Kingdom (&quot;GB&quot;) and the first letter of &quot;pound&quot;. 
In historical sources and some specialist banking uses, the abbreviation stg (in various styles) has been used to indicate sterling. Many stocks on the London Stock Exchange are quoted in penny sterling, using the unofficial code &quot;GBX&quot;.

===Cable===

The exchange rate of sterling against the US dollar is referred to as &quot;cable&quot; in the wholesale foreign exchange markets. The origins of this term are attributed to the fact that from the mid-19th century, the sterling/dollar exchange rate was transmitted via transatlantic cable.

===Slang terms ===
Historically almost every British coin had a widely recognised nickname, such as &quot;tanner&quot; for the sixpence and &quot;bob&quot; for the shilling. Since decimalisation these have mostly fallen out of use except as parts of proverbs.

A common slang term for the pound unit is &quot;quid&quot; (singular and plural, except in the common phrase &quot;quids in&quot;). Its origin is unknown: possible derivations include , the name for a number of currency units used in Italy until the 19th century, introduced by Italian immigrants; or from Latin via the common phrase &quot;quid pro quo&quot;, literally, &quot;what for what&quot;, or, figuratively, &quot;An equal exchange or substitution&quot;. The term &quot;nicker&quot; (also both singular and plural) may also refer to the pound.

==Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories==
The currency of all the Crown Dependencies (Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man) and a third of British Overseas Territories (British Antarctic Territory; Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands; Gibraltar; and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha) is either sterling or pegged to sterling at par.

The other British Overseas Territories have a local currency that is pegged to the U.S. dollar or the New Zealand dollar. The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (in Cyprus) use the euro.

==Subdivisions and other units==
===Decimal coinage===

Since decimalisation on Decimal Day in 1971, the pound has been divided into 100 pence (denoted on coinage, until 1981, as &quot;new pence&quot;). The symbol for the penny is &quot;p&quot;; hence an amount such as 50p (£0.50) properly pronounced &quot;fifty pence&quot; is often pronounced &quot;fifty pee&quot; /fɪfti piː/. The old sign &quot;d&quot; was not reused for the &quot;new penny&quot; in order to avoid confusion between the two units. A decimal halfpenny (p, worth 1.2 old pennies) was issued until 1984 but was withdrawn due to inflation.

===Pre-decimal===

Before decimalisation in 1971, the pound was divided into 20 shillings, and each shilling into 12 pence, making 240 pence to the pound. The symbol for the shilling was &quot;&quot;s&quot;.&quot; not from the first letter of &quot;shilling&quot;, but from the Latin &quot;solidus&quot;. The symbol for the penny was &quot;&quot;d&quot;.&quot;, from the French &quot;denier&quot;, from the Latin &quot;denarius&quot; (the solidus and denarius were Roman coins). A mixed sum of shillings and pence, such as 3 shillings and 6 pence, was written as &quot;3/6&quot; or &quot;3&quot;s&quot;. 6&quot;d&quot;.&quot; and spoken as &quot;three and six&quot; or &quot;three and sixpence&quot; except for &quot;1/1&quot;, &quot;2/1&quot; etc., which were spoken as &quot;one and a penny&quot;, &quot;two and a penny&quot;, etc. 5 shillings, for example, was written as &quot;5&quot;s&quot;.&quot; or, more commonly, &quot;5/–&quot; (five shillings, no pence).
Various coin denominations had, and in some cases continue to have, special names, such as florin (2/–), crown (5/–), farthing (&quot;d&quot;), sovereign (£1) and guinea (21s, 21/–, £1–1–0 or £1.05 in decimal notation). 

By the 1950s, coins of Kings George III, George IV and William IV had disappeared from circulation, but coins (at least the penny) bearing the head of every British monarch from Queen Victoria onwards could be found in circulation. Silver coins were replaced by those in cupro-nickel in 1947, and by the 1960s the silver coins were rarely seen. Silver/cupro-nickel sixpences, shillings (from any period after 1816) and florins (2 shillings) remained legal tender after decimalisation (as 2½p, 5p and 10p respectively) until 1980, 1990 and 1993 respectively, but are now officially demonetised.

==History (600–1945)==

The pound sterling emerged after the adoption of the Carolingian monetary system in England . Here is a summary of changes to its value in terms of silver or gold until 1816.

===Anglo-Saxon===


The pound was a unit of account in Anglo-Saxon England. By the ninth century it was equal to 240 silver pence.

The accounting system of dividing one pound into twenty shillings, a shilling into twelve pence, and a penny into four farthings was adopted from the livre carolingienne system introduced by Charlemagne to the Frankish Empire. The penny was abbreviated to &quot;d&quot;, from &quot;denarius&quot;, the Roman equivalent of the penny; the shilling to &quot;s&quot; from solidus (written with a long s, , later evolving into a simple slash, ); and the pound to &quot;L&quot; (subsequently £) from &quot;Libra&quot; or &quot;Livre&quot;.

The origins of sterling lie in the reign of King Offa of Mercia (757–796), who introduced a &quot;sterling&quot; coin made by physically dividing a Tower pound (5,400 grains, 349.9 grams) of silver into 240 parts. In practice, the weights of the coins were not consistent, 240 of them seldom added up to a full pound; there were no shilling or pound coins and these units were used only as an accounting convenience.

Halfpennies and farthings worth and penny respectively were also minted, but small change was more commonly produced by cutting up a whole penny.

===Medieval, 1158===

The early pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). In 1158, a new coinage was introduced by King Henry II (known as the &quot;Tealby penny&quot;), with a Tower Pound (5,400 grains, 349.9 g) of 92.5% silver minted into 240 pennies, each penny containing 20.82 grains (1.349 g) of fine silver. Called sterling silver, the alloy is harder than the 99.9% fine silver that was traditionally used, and sterling silver coins did not wear down as rapidly as fine silver ones.

The introduction of the larger French &quot;gros tournois&quot; coins in 1266, and their subsequent popularity, led to additional denominations in the form of groats worth four pence and half groats worth two pence. A gold penny weighing twice the silver penny and valued at 20 silver pence was also issued in 1257 but was not successful.

The English penny remained nearly unchanged from 800 and was a prominent exception in the progressive debasements of coinage which occurred in the rest of Europe. The Tower Pound, originally divided into 240 pence, devalued to 243 pence by 1279.

===Edward III, 1351===

During the reign of King Edward III, the introduction of gold coins received from Flanders as payment for English wool provided substantial economic and trade opportunities but also unsettled the currency for the next 200 years. The first monetary changes in 1344 consisted of
* English pennies reduced to grains () of sterling silver (or pure silver) and
* Gold double florins weighing and valued at 6 shillings (or 72 pence). (or pure gold).

The resulting gold-silver ratio of 1:12.55 was much higher than the ratio of 1:11 prevailing in the Continent, draining England of its silver coinage and requiring a more permanent remedy in 1351 in the form of
* Pennies reduced further to of sterling silver (or pure silver) and
* New gold nobles weighing of the finest gold possible at the time (191/192 or 99.48% fine), (meaning pure gold) and valued at 6 shillings and 8 pence (80 pence, or rd of a pound). The pure gold-silver ratio was thus .

These gold nobles, together with half-nobles (40 pence) and farthings or quarter-nobles (20 pence), became the first English gold coins produced in quantity.

===Henry IV, 1412===
The exigencies of the Hundred Years&#x27; War during the reign of King Henry IV resulted in further debasements toward the end of his reign, with the English penny reduced to 15 grains sterling silver (0.899 g fine silver) and the half-noble reduced to 54 grains (3.481 g fine gold). The gold-silver ratio went down to .

After the French monetary reform of 1425, the gold half-noble (th pound, 40 pence) was worth close to one Livre Parisis (French pound) or 20 sols, while the silver half-groat (2 pence, fine silver 1.798 g) was worth close to 1 sol parisis (1.912 g). Also, after the Flemish monetary reform of 1434, the new Dutch florin was valued close to 40 pence while the Dutch stuiver (shilling) of 1.63 g fine silver was valued close to 2 pence sterling at 1.8 g. This approximate pairing of English half-nobles and half-groats to Continental &quot;livres&quot; and &quot;sols&quot; persisted up to the 1560s.

===Great slump, 1464===
The Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump of the mid-15th century resulted in another reduction in the English penny to 12 grains sterling silver (0.719 g fine silver) and the introduction of a new half-angel gold coin of 40 grains (2.578 g), worth th pound or 40 pence. The gold-silver ratio rose again to . The reduction in the English penny approximately matched those with the French &quot;sol Parisis&quot; and the Flemish &quot;stuiver&quot;; furthermore, from 1469 to 1475 an agreement between England and the Burgundian Netherlands made the English groat (4-pence) mutually exchangeable with the Burgundian &quot;double patard&quot; (or 2-&quot;stuiver&quot;) minted under Charles the Rash.

40 pence or th pound sterling made one Troy Ounce (480 grains, 31.1035 g) of sterling silver. It was approximately on a par with France&#x27;s livre parisis of one French ounce (30.594 g), and in 1524 it would also be the model for a standardised German currency in the form of the Guldengroschen, which also weighed 1 German ounce of silver or .

===Tudor, 1551===

The last significant depreciation in sterling&#x27;s silver standard occurred amidst the 16th century influx of precious metals from the Americas arriving through the Habsburg Netherlands. Enforcement of monetary standards amongst its constituent provinces was loose, spending under King Henry VIII was extravagant, and England loosened the importation of cheaper continental coins for exchange into full-valued English coins. All these contributed to the Great Debasement which resulted in a significant rd reduction in the bullion content of each pound sterling in 1551.

The troy ounce of sterling silver was henceforth raised in price by 50% from 40 to 60 silver pennies (each penny weighing 8 grains sterling silver and containing fine silver). The gold half-angel of 40 grains ( fine gold) was raised in price from 40 pence to 60 pence (5 shillings or pound) and was henceforth known as the Crown.

Prior to 1551, English coin denominations closely matched with corresponding sol (2&quot;d&quot;) and livre (40&quot;d&quot;) denominations in the Continent, namely:
* Silver; see farthing (&quot;d&quot;), halfpenny (&quot;d&quot;), penny (1&quot;d&quot;), half-groat (2&quot;d&quot;), and groat (4&quot;d&quot;)
* Gold; see &quot;1351&quot;: noble (20&quot;d&quot;), noble (40&quot;d&quot;) and noble or angel (80&quot;d&quot;).

After 1551 new denominations were introduced, weighing similarly to 1464-issued coins but increased in value times, namely:
* In silver: the threepence (3&quot;d&quot;), replacing the half-groat; the sixpence (6&quot;d&quot;), replacing the groat; and a new shilling or testoon (1s or 1/–).
* In silver or gold: the crown (5/- (5s) or 60&quot;d&quot;), replacing the angel of 40&quot;d&quot;; and the half crown (2/6&quot;d&quot; or 30&quot;d&quot;), replacing the angel of 20&quot;d&quot;
* And in gold: the new half sovereign (10/–) and sovereign (£1 or 20/–)

===1601 to 1816===

The silver basis of sterling remained essentially unchanged until the 1816 introduction of the Gold Standard, save for the increase in the number of pennies in a troy ounce from 60 to 62 (hence, 0.464 g fine silver in a penny). Its gold basis remained unsettled, however, until the gold guinea was fixed at 21 shillings in 1717.

The guinea was introduced in 1663 with guineas minted out of 12 troy ounces of 22-karat gold (hence, 7.6885 g fine gold) and initially worth £1 or 20 shillings. While its price in shillings was not legally fixed at first, its persistent trade value above 21 shillings reflected the poor state of clipped underweight silver coins tolerated for payment. Milled shillings of full weight were hoarded and exported to the Continent, while clipped, hand-hammered shillings stayed in circulation (as Gresham&#x27;s law describes).

In the 17th century, English merchants tended to pay for imports in silver but were generally paid for exports in gold. This effect was notably driven by trade with the Far East, as the Chinese insisted on payments for their exports being settled in silver. From the mid-17th century, around of silver were received by China, principally from European powers, in exchange for Chinese tea and other goods. In order to be able to purchase Chinese exports in this period, England initially had to export to other European nations and request payment in silver, until the British East India Company was able to foster the indirect sale of opium to the Chinese.

Domestic demand for silver bullion in Britain further reduced silver coinage in circulation, as the improving fortunes of the merchant class led to increased demand for tableware. Silversmiths had always regarded coinage as a source of raw material, already verified for fineness by the government. As a result, sterling silver coins were being melted and fashioned into &quot;sterling silverware&quot; at an accelerating rate. An Act of the Parliament of England in 1697 tried to stem this tide by raising the minimum acceptable fineness on wrought plate from sterling&#x27;s 92.5% to a new Britannia silver standard of 95.83%. Silverware made purely from melted coins would be found wanting when the silversmith took his wares to the assay office, thus discouraging the melting of coins.

During the time of Sir Isaac Newton, Master of the Mint, the gold guinea was fixed at 21 shillings (£1/1/-) in 1717. But without addressing the problem of underweight silver coins, and with the high resulting gold-silver ratio of 15.2, it gave sterling a firmer footing in gold guineas rather than silver shillings, resulting in a de facto gold standard. Silver and copper tokens issued by private entities partly relieved the problem of small change until the Great Recoinage of 1816.

===Establishment of modern currency===
The Bank of England was founded in 1694, followed by the Bank of Scotland a year later.} The Bank of England began to issue banknotes from &quot;the late 1600s&quot;.

===Currency of Great Britain (1707) and the United Kingdom (1801)===
In the 17th century Scots currency was pegged to sterling at a value of £12 Scots = £1 sterling.

In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland merged into the Kingdom of Great Britain. In accordance with the Treaty of Union, the currency of Great Britain was sterling, with the pound Scots soon being replaced by sterling at the pegged value.

In 1801, Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland were united to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However, the Irish pound was not replaced by sterling until January 1826. The conversion rate had long been £13 Irish to £12 sterling. In 1928, six years after the Anglo-Irish Treaty restored Irish autonomy within the British Empire, the Irish Free State established a new Irish pound, initially pegged at par to sterling.

===Use in the Empire===

Sterling circulated in much of the British Empire. In some areas it was used alongside local currencies. For example, the gold sovereign was legal tender in Canada despite the use of the Canadian dollar. Several colonies and dominions adopted the pound as their own currency. These included Australia, Barbados, British West Africa, Cyprus, Fiji, British India, the Irish Free State, Jamaica, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Some of these retained parity with sterling throughout their existence (e.g. the South African pound), while others deviated from parity after the end of the gold standard (e.g. the Australian pound). These currencies and others tied to sterling constituted the core of the sterling area.

The original English colonies on mainland North America were not party to the sterling area because the above-mentioned silver shortage in England coincided with these colonies&#x27; formative years. As a result of equitable trade (and rather less equitable piracy), the Spanish milled dollar became the most common coin within the English colonies.

===Gold standard===

During the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic wars, Bank of England notes were legal tender, and their value floated relative to gold. The Bank also issued silver tokens to alleviate the shortage of silver coins. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with silver coins minted at a rate of 66 shillings to a troy pound (weight) of sterling silver, thus rendering them as &quot;token&quot; issues (i.e. not containing their value in precious metal). In 1817, the sovereign was introduced, valued at 20/–. Struck in 22‑carat gold, it contained 113 grains or of fine gold and replaced the guinea as the standard British gold coin without changing the gold standard.

By the 19th century, sterling notes were widely accepted outside Britain. The American journalist Nellie Bly carried Bank of England notes on her 1889–1890 trip around the world in 72 days. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many other countries adopted the gold standard. As a consequence, conversion rates between different currencies could be determined simply from the respective gold standards. £1 sterling was equal to US$4.87 in the United States, Can$4.87 in Canada, ƒ12.11 in Dutch territories, F 25.22 in French territories (or equivalent currencies of the Latin Monetary Union), 20ℳ 43₰ in Germany, Rbls 9.46 in Russia or K 24.02 in Austria-Hungary. After the International Monetary Conference of 1867 in Paris, the possibility of the UK joining the Latin Monetary Union was discussed, and a Royal Commission on International Coinage examined the issues, resulting in a decision against joining it.

===First world war: suspension of the gold standard===
The gold standard was suspended at the outbreak of First World War in 1914, with Bank of England and Treasury notes becoming legal tender. Before that war, the United Kingdom had one of the world&#x27;s strongest economies, holding 40% of the world&#x27;s overseas investments. But after the end of the war, the country was highly indebted: Britain owed £850 million (about £ today) with interest costing the country some 40% of all government spending. The British government under Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Chancellor of the Exchequer Austen Chamberlain tried to make up for the deficit with a deflationary policy, but this only led to the Depression of 1920–21.

By 1917, production of gold sovereigns had almost halted (the remaining production was for collector&#x27;s sets and other very specific occasions), and by 1920, the silver coinage was debased from its original .925 fine to just .500 fine. That was due to a drastic increase in silver prices from an average 27/6&quot;d&quot;. [£1.375] per troy pound in the period between 1894 and 1913, to 89/6&quot;d&quot;. [£4.475] in August 1920.

===Interwar period: gold standard reinstated===
To try to resume stability, a version of the gold standard was reintroduced in 1925, under which the currency was fixed to gold at its pre-war peg, but one could only exchange currency for gold bullion, not for coins. On 21 September 1931, this was abandoned during the Great Depression, and sterling suffered an initial devaluation of some 25%.

Since the suspension of the gold standard in 1931, sterling has been a fiat currency, with its value determined by its continued acceptance in the national and international economy.

===World War II===
In 1940, an agreement with the US pegged sterling to the US dollar at a rate of £1 = US$4.03. (Only the year before, it had been US$4.86.) This rate was maintained through the Second World War and became part of the Bretton Woods system which governed post-war exchange rates.

==History (1946–present)==
===Bretton Woods===

Under continuing economic pressure, and despite months of denials that it would do so, on 19 September 1949 the government devalued the pound by 30.5% to US$2.80. The 1949 sterling devaluation prompted several other currencies to be devalued against the dollar.

In 1961, 1964, and 1966, sterling came under renewed pressure, as speculators were selling pounds for dollars. In summer 1966, with the value of the pound falling in the currency markets, exchange controls were tightened by the Wilson government. Among the measures, tourists were banned from taking more than £50 out of the country in travellers&#x27; cheques and remittances, plus £15 in cash; this restriction was not lifted until 1979. Sterling was devalued by 14.3% to £1 = US$2.40 on 18 November 1967.

===Decimalisation===
Until decimalisation, amounts in sterling were expressed in pounds, shillings, and pence, with various widely understood notations. The same amount could be stated as 32&quot;s&quot;. 6&quot;d&quot;., 32/6, £1. 12&quot;s&quot;. 6&quot;d&quot;., or £1/12/6. It was customary to specify some prices (for example professional fees and auction prices for works of art) in guineas (abbr: gn. or gns.), although guinea coins were no longer in use.

Formal parliamentary proposals to decimalise sterling were first made in 1824 when Sir John Wrottesley, MP for Staffordshire, asked in the House of Commons whether consideration had been given to decimalising the currency. Wrottesley raised the issue in the House of Commons again in 1833, and it was again raised by John Bowring, MP for Kilmarnock Burghs, in 1847 whose efforts led to the introduction in 1848 of what was in effect the first decimal coin in the United Kingdom, the florin, valued at one-tenth of a pound. However, full decimalisation was resisted, although the florin coin, re-designated as &quot;ten new pence&quot;, survived the transfer to a full decimal system in 1971, with examples surviving in British coinage until 1993.

John Benjamin Smith, MP for Stirling Burghs, raised the issue of full decimalisation again in Parliament in 1853, resulting in the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Gladstone, announcing soon afterwards that &quot;the great question of a decimal coinage&quot; was &quot;now under serious consideration&quot;. A full proposal for the decimalisation of sterling was then tabled in the House of Commons in June 1855, by William Brown, MP for Lancashire Southern, with the suggestion that the pound sterling be divided into one thousand parts, each called a &quot;mil&quot;, or alternatively a farthing, as the pound was then equivalent to 960 farthings which could easily be rounded up to one thousand farthings in the new system. This did not result in the conversion of sterling into a decimal system, but it was agreed to establish a Royal Commission to look into the issue. However, largely due to the hostility to decimalisation of two of the appointed commissioners, Lord Overstone (a banker) and John Hubbard (Governor of the Bank of England), decimalisation in Britain was effectively quashed for over a hundred years.

However, sterling was decimalised in various British colonial territories before the United Kingdom (and in several cases in line with William Brown&#x27;s proposal that the pound be divided into 1,000 parts, called mils). These included Hong Kong from 1863 to 1866; Cyprus from 1955 until 1960 (and continued on the island as the division of the Cypriot pound until 1983); and the Palestine Mandate from 1926 until 1948.

Later, in 1966, the UK Government decided to include in the Queen&#x27;s Speech a plan to convert sterling into a decimal currency. As a result of this, on 15 February 1971, the UK decimalised sterling, replacing the shilling and the penny with a single subdivision, the &quot;new penny&quot;, which was worth 2.4&quot;d&quot;. For example, a price tag of £1/12/6. became . The word &quot;new&quot; was omitted from coins minted after 1981.

===Free-floating pound===

With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, sterling floated from August 1971 onwards. At first, it appreciated a little, rising to almost in March 1972 from , the upper bound of the band in which it had been fixed. The sterling area effectively ended at this time, when the majority of its members also chose to float freely against sterling and the dollar.

===1976 sterling crisis===

James Callaghan became Prime Minister in 1976. He was immediately told the economy was facing huge problems, according to documents released in 2006 by the National Archives. The effects of the failed Barber Boom and the 1973 oil crisis were still being felt, with inflation rising to nearly 27% in 1975. Financial markets were beginning to believe the pound was overvalued, and in April that year &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; advised the sale of sterling investments in the face of high taxes, in a story that ended with &quot;goodbye, Great Britain. It was nice knowing you&quot;. At the time the UK Government was running a budget deficit, and the Labour government&#x27;s strategy emphasised high public spending. Callaghan was told there were three possible outcomes: a disastrous free fall in sterling, an internationally unacceptable siege economy, or a deal with key allies to prop up the pound while painful economic reforms were put in place. The US Government feared the crisis could endanger NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC), and in light of this, the US Treasury set out to force domestic policy changes. In November 1976, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced the conditions for a loan, including deep cuts in public expenditure.

===1979–1989===
The Conservative Party was elected to office in 1979, on a programme of fiscal austerity. Initially, sterling rocketed, moving above £1 to US$2.40, as interest rates rose in response to the monetarist policy of targeting money supply. The high exchange rate was widely blamed for the deep recession of 1981. Sterling fell sharply after 1980; at its lowest, £1 stood at just US$1.03 in March 1985, before rising to US$1.70 in December 1989.

===Following the Deutsche Mark===
In 1988, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, decided that sterling should &quot;shadow&quot; the Deutsche Mark (DM), with the unintended result of a rapid rise in inflation as the economy boomed due to low interest rates.

Following German reunification in 1990, the reverse held true, as high German borrowing costs to fund Eastern reconstruction, exacerbated by the political decision to convert the Ostmark to the D–Mark on a 1:1 basis, meant that interest rates in other countries shadowing the D–Mark, especially the UK, were far too high relative to domestic circumstances, leading to a housing decline and recession.

===Following the European Currency Unit===
On 8 October 1990 the Conservative government (Third Thatcher ministry) decided to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with £1 set at DM 2.95. However, the country was forced to withdraw from the system on &quot;Black Wednesday&quot; (16 September 1992) as Britain&#x27;s economic performance made the exchange rate unsustainable. The event was also triggered by comments by Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger who suggested the pound would eventually have to be devalued.

&quot;Black Wednesday&quot; saw interest rates jump from 10% to 15% in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the pound from falling below the ERM limits. The exchange rate fell to DM 2.20. Those who had argued for a lower GBP/DM exchange rate were vindicated since the cheaper pound encouraged exports and contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1990s.

===Following inflation targets===
In 1997, the newly elected Labour government handed over day-to-day control of interest rates to the Bank of England (a policy that had originally been advocated by the Liberal Democrats). The Bank is now responsible for setting its base rate of interest so as to keep inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)) very close to 2% per annum. Should CPI inflation be more than one percentage point above or below the target, the Governor of the Bank of England is required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the reasons for this and the measures which will be taken to bring this measure of inflation back in line with the 2% target. On 17 April 2007, annual CPI inflation was reported at 3.1% (inflation of the Retail Prices Index was 4.8%). Accordingly, and for the first time, the Governor had to write publicly to the UK Government explaining why inflation was more than one percentage point higher than its target.

===Euro===

In 2007, Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, ruled out membership in the eurozone for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.

On 1 January 2008, with the Republic of Cyprus switching its currency from the Cypriot pound to the euro, the British sovereign bases on Cyprus (Akrotiri and Dhekelia) followed suit, making the Sovereign Base Areas the only territory under British sovereignty to officially use the euro.

The government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a public referendum to decide on the adoption of the Euro should &quot;five economic tests&quot; be met, to increase the likelihood that any adoption of the euro would be in the national interest. In addition to these internal (national) criteria, the UK would have to meet the European Union&#x27;s economic convergence criteria (Maastricht criteria) before being allowed to adopt the euro. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government (2010–2015) ruled out joining the euro for that parliamentary term.

The idea of replacing sterling with the euro was always controversial with the British public, partly because of sterling&#x27;s identity as a symbol of British sovereignty and because it would, according to some critics, have led to suboptimal interest rates, harming the British economy. In December 2008, the results of a BBC poll of 1,000 people suggested that 71% would vote no to the euro, 23% would vote yes, while 6% said they were unsure. Sterling did not join the Second European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) after the euro was created. Denmark and the UK had opt-outs from entry to the euro. Theoretically, every EU nation but Denmark must eventually sign up.

As a member of the European Union, the United Kingdom could have adopted the euro as its currency. However, the subject was always politically controversial, and the UK negotiated an opt-out on this issue. Following the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU, on 31 January 2020, the Bank of England ended its membership of the European System of Central Banks, and shares in the European Central Bank were reallocated to other EU banks.

===Recent exchange rates===


Sterling and the euro fluctuate in value against one another, although there may be correlation between movements in their respective exchange rates with other currencies such as the US dollar. Inflation concerns in the UK led the Bank of England to raise interest rates in late 2006 and 2007. This caused sterling to appreciate against other major currencies and, with the US dollar depreciating at the same time, sterling hit a 15-year high against the US dollar on 18 April 2007, with £1 reaching US$2 the day before, for the first time since 1992. Sterling and many other currencies continued to appreciate against the dollar; sterling hit a 26-year high of £1 to US$2.1161 on 7 November 2007 as the dollar fell worldwide. From mid-2003 to mid-2007, the pound/euro rate remained within a narrow range (€1.45 ± 5%).

Following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, sterling depreciated sharply, declining to £1 to US$1.38 on 23 January 2009 and falling below £1 to €1.25 against the euro in April 2008. There was a further decline during the remainder of 2008, most dramatically on 29 December when its euro rate hit an all-time low at €1.0219, while its US dollar rate depreciated. Sterling appreciated in early 2009, reaching a peak against the euro of £1 to €1.17 in mid-July. In the following months sterling remained broadly steady against the euro, with £1 valued on 27 May 2011 at €1.15 and US$1.65.

On 5 March 2009, the Bank of England announced that it would pump £75 billion of new capital into the British economy, through a process known as quantitative easing (QE). This was the first time in the United Kingdom&#x27;s history that this measure had been used, although the Bank&#x27;s Governor Mervyn King suggested it was not an experiment.

The process saw the Bank of England creating new money for itself, which it then used to purchase assets such as government bonds, secured commercial paper, or corporate bonds. The initial amount stated to be created through this method was £75 billion, although Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling had given permission for up to £150 billion to be created if necessary. It was expected that the process would continue for three months, with results only likely in the long term. By 5 November 2009, some £175 billion had been injected using QE, and the process remained less effective in the long term. In July 2012, the final increase in QE meant it had peaked at £375 billion, then holding solely UK Government bonds, representing one third of the UK national debt.

The result of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership caused a major decline in sterling against other world currencies as the future of international trade relationships and domestic political leadership became unclear. The referendum result weakened sterling against the euro by 5% overnight. The night before the vote, sterling was trading at £1 to €1.30; the next day, this had fallen to £1 to €1.23. By October 2016, the exchange rate was £1 to €1.12, a fall of 14% since the referendum. By the end of August 2017 sterling was even lower, at £1 to €1.08. Against the US dollar, meanwhile, sterling fell from £1 to $1.466 to £1 to $1.3694 when the referendum result was first revealed, and down to £1 to $1.2232 by October 2016, a fall of 16%.

In September 2022, under the influence of inflation and tax cuts funded by borrowing, sterling&#x27;s value reached an all-time low of just over $1.03.

===Annual inflation rate===

The Bank of England had stated in 2009 that the decision had been taken to prevent the rate of inflation falling below the 2% target rate. Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, had also suggested there were no other monetary options left, as interest rates had already been cut to their lowest level ever (0.5%) and it was unlikely that they would be cut further.

The inflation rate rose in following years, reaching 5.2% per year (based on the Consumer Price Index) in September 2011, then decreased to around 2.5% the following year. After a number of years when inflation remained near or below the Bank&#x27;s 2% target, 2021 saw a significant and sustained increase on all indices: , RPI had reached 7.1%, CPI 5.1% and CPIH 4.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ONS 15/12/21&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coins==
===Pre-decimal coins===
The silver penny (plural: &quot;pence&quot;; abbreviation: &quot;d&quot;) was the principal and often the only coin in circulation from the 8th century until the 13th century. Although some fractions of the penny were struck (see farthing and halfpenny), it was more common to find pennies cut into halves and quarters to provide smaller change. Very few gold coins were struck, with the gold penny (equal in value to 20 silver pennies) a rare example. However, in 1279, the &quot;groat&quot;, worth 4&quot;d&quot;, was introduced, with the half groat following in 1344. 1344 also saw the establishment of a gold coinage with the introduction (after the failed gold florin) of the &quot;noble&quot; worth six shillings and eight pence (6/8&quot;d&quot;) (i.e. 3 nobles to the pound), together with the half and quarter noble. Reforms in 1464 saw a reduction in value of the coinage in both silver and gold, with the noble renamed the &quot;ryal&quot; and worth 10/– (i.e. 2 to the pound) and the &quot;angel&quot; introduced at the noble&#x27;s old value of 6/8&quot;d&quot;.

The reign of Henry VII saw the introduction of two important coins: the shilling (abbr.: &quot;s&quot;; known as the &quot;testoon&quot;, equivalent to twelve pence) in 1487 and the pound (known as the &quot;sovereign&quot;, abbr.: &quot;£&quot; before numerals or &quot;&quot;l&quot;.&quot; (lower-case L) after them, equivalent to twenty shillings) in 1489. In 1526, several new denominations of gold coins were added, including the &quot;crown&quot; and &quot;half crown&quot;, worth five shillings (&quot;5/–&quot;) and two shillings and six pence (&quot;2/6&quot;, &quot;two and six&quot;) respectively. Henry VIII&#x27;s reign (1509–1547) saw a high level of debasement which continued into the reign of Edward VI (1547–1553). This debasement was halted in 1552, and new silver coinage was introduced, including coins for 1&quot;d&quot;, 2&quot;d&quot;, 3d, 4&quot;d&quot; and 6&quot;d&quot;, 1/–, 2/6&quot;d&quot; and 5/–. In the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603), silver &quot;d&quot; and &quot;d&quot; coins were added, but these denominations did not last. Gold coins included the half-crown, crown, angel, half-sovereign (10/–) and sovereign (£1). Elizabeth&#x27;s reign also saw the introduction of the horse-drawn screw press to produce the first &quot;milled&quot; coins.

Following the succession of the Scottish King James VI to the English throne, a new gold coinage was introduced, including the &quot;spur ryal&quot; (15/–), the &quot;unite&quot; (20/–) and the &quot;rose ryal&quot; (30/–). The &quot;laurel&quot;, worth 20/–, followed in 1619. The first base metal coins were also introduced: tin and copper farthings. Copper halfpenny coins followed in the reign of Charles I. During the English Civil War, a number of siege coinages were produced, often in unusual denominations.

Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the coinage was reformed, with the ending of production of hammered coins in 1662. The &quot;guinea&quot; was introduced in 1663, soon followed by the , 2 and 5 guinea coins. The silver coinage consisted of denominations of 1&quot;d&quot;, 2&quot;d&quot;, 3&quot;d&quot;, 4&quot;d&quot; and 6&quot;d&quot;, 1/–, 2/6&quot;d&quot; and 5/–. Due to the widespread export of silver in the 18th century, the production of silver coins gradually came to a halt, with the half crown and crown not issued after the 1750s, and the 6&quot;d&quot; and 1/– stopping production in the 1780s. In response, copper 1&quot;d&quot; and 2&quot;d&quot; coins and a gold guinea (7/–) were introduced in 1797. The copper penny was the only one of these coins to survive long.

To alleviate the shortage of silver coins, between 1797 and 1804, the Bank of England counterstamped Spanish dollars (8 reales) and other Spanish and Spanish colonial coins for circulation. A small counterstamp of the King&#x27;s head was used. Until 1800, these circulated at a rate of 4/9&quot;d&quot; for 8 reales. After 1800, a rate of 5/– for 8 reales was used. The Bank then issued silver tokens for 5/– (struck over Spanish dollars) in 1804, followed by tokens for 1/6&quot;d&quot; and 3/– between 1811 and 1816.

In 1816, a new silver coinage was introduced in denominations of 6&quot;d&quot;, 1/–, 2/6&quot;d&quot; (half-crown) and 5/– (crown). The crown was only issued intermittently until 1900. It was followed by a new gold coinage in 1817 consisting of 10/– and £1 coins, known as the half sovereign and sovereign. The silver 4&quot;d&quot; coin was reintroduced in 1836, followed by the 3&quot;d&quot; in 1838, with the 4&quot;d&quot; coin issued only for colonial use after 1855. In 1848, the 2/– &quot;florin&quot; was introduced, followed by the short-lived double florin in 1887. In 1860, copper was replaced by bronze in the farthing (quarter penny, &quot;d&quot;), halfpenny and penny.

During the First World War, production of the sovereign and half-sovereign was suspended, and although the gold standard was later restored, the coins saw little circulation thereafter. In 1920, the silver standard, maintained at .925 since 1552, was reduced to .500. In 1937, a nickel-brass 3&quot;d&quot; coin was introduced; the last silver 3&quot;d&quot; coins were issued seven years later. In 1947, the remaining silver coins were replaced with cupro-nickel, with the exception of Maundy coinage which was then restored to .925. Inflation caused the farthing to cease production in 1956 and be demonetised in 1960. In the run-up to decimalisation, the halfpenny and half-crown were demonetised in 1969.

===Decimal coins===

British coinage timeline:
* 1968: The first decimal coins were introduced. These were cupro-nickel 5p and 10p coins which were the same size as, equivalent in value to, and circulated alongside, the one shilling coin and the florin (two shilling coin) respectively.
* 1969: The curved equilateral heptagonal cupro-nickel 50p coin replaced the ten shilling note (10/–).
* 1970: The half crown (2/6&quot;d&quot;, 12.5p) was demonetised.
* 1971: The decimal coinage was completed when decimalisation came into effect in 1971 with the introduction of the bronze half new penny (p), new penny (1p), and two new pence (2p) coins and the withdrawal of the (old) penny (1&quot;d&quot;) and (old) threepence (3&quot;d&quot;) coins.
* 1980: Withdrawal of the sixpence (6&quot;d&quot;) coin, which had continued in circulation at a value of p.
* 1982: The word &quot;new&quot; was dropped from the coinage and a 20p coin was introduced.
* 1983: A (round, brass) £1 coin was introduced.
* 1983: The p coin was last produced.
* 1984: The p coin was withdrawn from circulation.
* 1990: The crown, historically valued at five shillings (25p), was re-tariffed for future issues as a commemorative coin at £5.
* 1990: A new, smaller 5p coin was introduced, replacing the original size that had been the same as the shilling coins of the same value that it had in turn replaced. These first generation 5p coins and any remaining old shilling coins were withdrawn from circulation in 1991.
* 1992: A new, smaller 10p coin was introduced, replacing the original size that had been the same as the florin or two shilling coins of the same value that it had in turn replaced. These first generation 10p coins and any remaining old florin coins were withdrawn from circulation over the following two years.
* 1992: 1p and 2p coins began to be minted in copper-plated steel (the original bronze coins continued in circulation).
* 1997: A new 50p coin was introduced, replacing the original size that had been in use since 1969, and the first generation 50p coins were withdrawn from circulation.
* 1998: The bi-metallic £2 coin was introduced.
* 2007: By now the value of copper in the pre-1992 1p and 2p coins (which are 97% copper) exceeded those coins&#x27; face value to such an extent that melting down the coins by entrepreneurs was becoming worthwhile (with a premium of up to 11%, with smelting costs reducing this to around 4%)—although this is illegal, and the market value of copper has subsequently fallen dramatically from these earlier peaks.
* In April 2008, an extensive redesign of the coinage was unveiled. The 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, and 50p coins feature parts of the Royal Shield on their reverse; and the reverse of the pound coin showed the whole shield. The coins were issued gradually into circulation, starting in mid-2008. They have the same sizes, shapes and weights as those with the old designs which, apart from the round pound coin which was withdrawn in 2017, continue to circulate.
* 2012: The 5p and 10p coins were changed from cupro-nickel to nickel-plated steel.
* 2017: A more secure twelve-sided bi-metallic £1 coin was introduced to reduce forgery. The old round £1 coin ceased to be legal tender on 15 October 2017.

, the oldest circulating coins in the UK are the 1p and 2p copper coins introduced in 1971. No other coins from before 1982 are in circulation. Prior to the withdrawal from circulation in 1992, the oldest circulating coins usually dated from 1947: although older coins were still legal tender, inflation meant that their silver content was worth more than their face value, so they tended to be removed from circulation and hoarded. Before decimalisation in 1971, a handful of change might have contained coins over 100 years old, bearing any of five monarchs&#x27; heads, especially in the copper coins.

==Banknotes==
The first sterling notes were issued by the Bank of England shortly after its foundation in 1694. Denominations were initially handwritten on the notes at the time of issue. From 1745, the notes were printed in denominations between £20 and £1,000, with any odd shillings added by hand. £10 notes were added in 1759, followed by £5 in 1793 and £1 and £2 in 1797. The lowest two denominations were withdrawn after the end of the Napoleonic wars. In 1855, the notes were converted to being entirely printed, with denominations of £5, £10, £20, £50, £100, £200, £300, £500 and £1,000 issued.

The Bank of Scotland began issuing notes in 1695. Although the pound Scots was still the currency of Scotland, these notes were denominated in sterling in values up to £100. From 1727, the Royal Bank of Scotland also issued notes. Both banks issued some notes denominated in guineas as well as pounds. In the 19th century, regulations limited the smallest note issued by Scottish banks to be the £1 denomination, a note not permitted in England.

With the extension of sterling to Ireland in 1825, the Bank of Ireland began issuing sterling notes, later followed by other Irish banks. These notes included the unusual denominations of 30/– and £3. The highest denomination issued by the Irish banks was £100.

In 1826, banks at least from London were given permission to issue their own paper money. From 1844, new banks were excluded from issuing notes in England and Wales but not in Scotland and Ireland. Consequently, the number of private banknotes dwindled in England and Wales but proliferated in Scotland and Ireland. The last English private banknotes were issued in 1921.

In 1914, the Treasury introduced notes for 10/– and £1 to replace gold coins. These circulated until 1928 when they were replaced by Bank of England notes. Irish independence reduced the number of Irish banks issuing sterling notes to five operating in Northern Ireland. The Second World War had a drastic effect on the note production of the Bank of England. Fearful of mass forgery by the Nazis (see Operation Bernhard), all notes for £10 and above ceased production, leaving the bank to issue only 10/–, £1 and £5 notes. Scottish and Northern Irish issues were unaffected, with issues in denominations of £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100.

Due to repeated devaluations and spiralling inflation the Bank of England reintroduced £10 notes in 1964. In 1969, the 10/– note was replaced by the 50p coin, again due to inflation. £20 Bank of England notes were reintroduced in 1970, followed by £50 in 1981. A £1 coin was introduced in 1983, and Bank of England £1 notes were withdrawn in 1988. Scottish and Northern Irish banks followed, with only the Royal Bank of Scotland continuing to issue this denomination.

UK notes include raised print (e.g. on the words &quot;Bank of England&quot;); watermarks; embedded metallic thread; holograms; and fluorescent ink visible only under UV lamps. Three printing techniques are involved: offset litho, intaglio and letterpress; and the notes incorporate a total of 85 specialized inks.

The Bank of England produces notes named &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;titan&quot;. A giant is a one million pound note, and a titan is a one hundred million pound bank note. Giants and titans are used only within the banking system.

===Polymer banknotes===
The Northern Bank £5 note, issued by Northern Ireland&#x27;s Northern Bank (now Danske Bank) in 2000, was the only polymer banknote in circulation until 2016. The Bank of England introduced £5 polymer banknotes in September 2016, and the paper £5 notes were withdrawn on 5 May 2017. A polymer £10 banknote was introduced on 14 September 2017, and the paper note was withdrawn on 1 March 2018. A polymer £20 banknote was introduced on 20 February 2020, followed by a polymer £50 in 2021.

==Monetary policy==
As the central bank of the United Kingdom which has been delegated authority by the government, the Bank of England sets the monetary policy for the British pound by controlling the amount of money in circulation. It has a monopoly on the issuance of banknotes in England and Wales and regulates the amount of banknotes issued by seven authorized banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. HM Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee &quot;if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances&quot; but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days.

Unlike banknotes which have separate issuers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, all British coins are issued by the Royal Mint, an independent enterprise (wholly owned by the Treasury) which also mints coins for other countries.

==Legal tender and national issues==

Legal tender in the United Kingdom is defined such that &quot;a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender.&quot; Parties can alternatively settle a debt by other means with mutual consent. Strictly speaking, it is necessary for the debtor to offer the exact amount due as there is no obligation for the other party to provide change.

Throughout the UK, £1 and £2 coins are legal tender for any amount, with the other coins being legal tender only for limited amounts. Bank of England notes are legal tender for any amount in England and Wales, but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland. (Bank of England 10/– and £1 notes were legal tender, as were Scottish banknotes, during World War II under the Currency (Defence) Act 1939, which was repealed on 1 January 1946.) Channel Islands and Manx banknotes are legal tender only in their respective jurisdictions.

Bank of England, Scottish, Northern Irish, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, and Falkland banknotes may be offered anywhere in the UK, although there is no obligation to accept them as a means of payment, and acceptance varies. For example, merchants in England generally accept Scottish and Northern Irish notes, but some unfamiliar with them may reject them. However, Scottish and Northern Irish notes both tend to be accepted in Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively. Merchants in England generally do not accept Jersey, Guernsey, Manx, Gibraltarian, and Falkland notes but Manx notes are generally accepted in Northern Ireland. Bank of England notes are generally accepted in the Falklands and Gibraltar, but for example, Scottish and Northern Irish notes are not. Since all of the notes are denominated in sterling, banks will exchange them for locally issued notes at face value, though some in the UK have had trouble exchanging Falkland Islands notes.

Commemorative £5 and 25p (crown) coins, and decimal sixpences (6p, not the pre-decimalisation 6&quot;d&quot;, equivalent to p) made for traditional wedding ceremonies and Christmas gifts, although rarely if ever seen in circulation, are formally legal tender, as are the bullion coins issued by the Mint.

===Pegged currencies===
In Britain&#x27;s Crown Dependencies, the Manx pound, Jersey pound, and Guernsey pound are unregulated by the Bank of England and are issued independently. However, they are maintained at a fixed exchange rate by their respective governments, and Bank of England notes have been made legal tender on the islands, forming a sort of one-way de facto currency union. Internationally they are considered local issues of sterling so do not have ISO 4217 codes. &quot;GBP&quot; is usually used to represent all of them; informal abbreviations resembling ISO codes are used where the distinction is important.

British Overseas Territories are responsible for the monetary policy of their own currencies (where they exist), and have their own ISO 4217 codes. The Falkland Islands pound, Gibraltar pound, and Saint Helena pound are set at a fixed 1:1 exchange rate with the British pound by local governments.

==Value==
In 2006, the House of Commons Library published a research paper which included an index of prices for each year between 1750 and 2005, where 1974 was indexed at 100.

Regarding the period 1750–1914 the document states: &quot;Although there was considerable year on year fluctuation in price levels prior to 1914 (reflecting the quality of the harvest, wars, etc.) there was not the long-term steady increase in prices associated with the period since 1945&quot;. It goes on to say that &quot;Since 1945 prices have risen in every year with an aggregate rise of over 27 times&quot;.

The value of the index in 1751 was 5.1, increasing to a peak of 16.3 in 1813 before declining very soon after the end of the Napoleonic Wars to around 10.0 and remaining in the range 8.5–10.0 at the end of the 19th century. The index was 9.8 in 1914 and peaked at 25.3 in 1920, before declining to 15.8 in 1933 and 1934—prices were only about three times as high as they had been 180 years earlier.

Inflation has had a dramatic effect during and after World War II: the index was 20.2 in 1940, 33.0 in 1950, 49.1 in 1960, 73.1 in 1970, 263.7 in 1980, 497.5 in 1990, 671.8 in 2000 and 757.3 in 2005. The smallest coin in 1971 was the p, worth about 6.4p in 2015 prices.

The following table shows the equivalent amount of goods and services that, in a particular year, could be purchased with £1.

The table shows that from 1971 to 2023, the buying power of a pound fell by 94.4%.

For example, the purchasing power of a pound in 2006 was slightly more than that of 10p in 1971; conversely, the purchasing power of a pound in 1971 was slightly less than that of £10 in 2006. The hypothetical &quot;shopping basket&quot; of goods and services that cost £10 in 1971 would cost £98.04 in 2006 (and £163.40 in 2022).

==Exchange rate==
Sterling is freely bought and sold on the foreign exchange markets around the world, and its value relative to other currencies therefore fluctuates.

==Reserve==
Sterling is used as a reserve currency around the world. , it is ranked fourth in value held as reserves.

<doc id="270674" wikidata="Q1545870" url="?curid=270674" title="Veterans Stadium">
<text>Veterans Stadium was a multi-purpose stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, at the northeast corner of Broad Street and Pattison Avenue, part of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The seating capacities were 65,358 for football, and 56,371 for baseball.

It hosted the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1971 to 2003 and the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL) from 1971 to 2002. The 1976 and 1996 Major League Baseball All-Star Games were held at the venue. It also hosted the annual Army-Navy football game between 1980 and 2001.

In addition to professional baseball and football, the stadium hosted other amateur and professional sports, large entertainment events, and other civic affairs. It was demolished by implosion in March 2004, being replaced by the adjacent Citizens Bank Park and Lincoln Financial Field. A parking lot now sits on its former site.

==History==
===Plans and construction===

In 1959, Phillies owner R. R. M. Carpenter Jr. proposed building a new ballpark for the Philadelphia Phillies on adjacent to the Garden State Park Racetrack in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. The Phillies&#x27; were playing at Connie Mack Stadium, a stadium built in 1909 that was beginning to show its age. Connie Mack Stadium also had inadequate parking, and was located in a declining section of the city. The same year, alcohol sales at sporting events were banned in Pennsylvania but were still legal across the Delaware River in neighboring South Jersey.

The stadium proposed by Carpenter would have seated 45,000 fans but would be expandable to 60,000, and would have 15,000 parking spaces.

The American League&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics moved to Kansas City following the 1954 season, while the NBA&#x27;s Philadelphia Warriors moved to San Francisco to become the Golden State Warriors in 1962, and Philadelphians were not going to allow losing another professional sports franchise.

===Financing===
In 1964, Philadelphia voters approved a US$25-million-bond issue for a new stadium to serve as the home of both the Eagles, who played at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Franklin Field, and the Phillies. Because of cost overruns, the voters had to go to the polls again in 1967 to approve another $13 million. At a total cost of $60 million, it was at the time one of the most expensive stadiums ever constructed.

===Naming===
In 1968, Philadelphia City Council named the stadium Veterans stadium in honor of veterans. In December 1969, the Phillies announced that they anticipated that they would play the first month of the 1970 season at Connie Mack Stadium before moving to the new venue. However, the opening was delayed a year because of a combination of bad weather and cost overruns.

===Structure and design===
The stadium&#x27;s design was nearly circular, and was known as an octorad design, which attempted to facilitate both football and baseball. San Diego Stadium in San Diego had been similarly designed. As was the case with other cities where this dual approach was used, such as RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Shea Stadium in New York City, the Astrodome in Houston, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati, and Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, the fundamentally different sizes and shapes of the playing fields made the stadium inadequate to the needs of either sport.

===Opening===
The stadium opened with a $3 million scoreboard complex that at the time was the most expensive ever installed.

Prior to its opening, the stadium was blessed by Marine Corps chaplain veteran Francis &quot;Father Foxhole&quot; Kelly.

====Philadelphia Phillies====
The Philadelphia Phillies played their first game at the stadium on April 10, 1971, beating the Montreal Expos, 4–1, before an audience of 55,352. The first ball was dropped by helicopter to Phillies back-up catcher Mike Ryan.

Jim Bunning, who was named to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996, was the winning pitcher, and Bill Stoneman of the Expos took the loss. Entertainer Mike Douglas, whose daily talk show was taped in Philadelphia, sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before the game. The emcee for the opening ceremonies was Harry Kalas, the new Phillies play-by-play announcer.

Boots Day opened the game by grounding out to Bunning. Larry Bowa had the stadium&#x27;s first hit, and Don Money hit the first home run in the stadium.

====Philadelphia Eagles====
On September 26, 1971, the Philadelphia Eagles played their first game at Veterans Stadium, hosting the Dallas Cowboys in a game the Eagles lost 42–7. The first Eagles touchdown at the stadium, and the Eagles only points during the game, came from Al Nelson&#x27;s then-record 102-yard return of a missed field goal by Mike Clark in the fourth quarter.

===Stadium deterioriation===
As the stadium aged, its condition deteriorated. A hole in the wall allowed visiting teams&#x27; players to peep into the dressing room of the Eagles Cheerleaders. So many mice infested the stadium that the security force employed cats as mousers.

===Final games===
====Philadelphia Eagles====
The final Eagles game played at Veterans Stadium was the Eagles&#x27; 27–10 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the 2002 NFC Championship Game on January 19, 2003. The Eagles moved into Lincoln Financial Field in August 2003.

====Philadelphia Phillies====
The final game ever played at the stadium was the afternoon of September 28, 2003, a 5–2 Phillies loss to the Atlanta Braves.

The final win at the stadium was recorded by Greg Maddux of the Braves; the final loss at the stadium was recorded by the Phillies&#x27; Kevin Millwood. The final Phillies run was scored by Marlon Byrd in the bottom of the 3rd inning, and the final run altogether by the Braves&#x27; Andruw Jones on a double by Robert Fick, who also had the last hit at Tiger Stadium while with the Detroit Tigers four years earlier in the top of the 5th.

The final hit at Veterans Stadium was a single by the Phillies&#x27; Pat Burrell in the bottom of the 9th inning. The next batter, Chase Utley, grounded into a double play to end the game and Veterans Stadium. A ceremony at Veterans Stadium following the final Phillies game at the stadium pulled at the heartstrings of the sellout crowd. Paul Owens, a former Phillies general manager, and Tug McGraw, a former Phillies pitcher, made their final public appearances at the park that day; both men died that winter.

The last publicly broadcast words uttered at Veterans Stadium came from Harry Kalas, who helped open the facility on April 10, 1971, who paraphrased his trademark home run call: &quot;It&#x27;s on a looooooong drive…IT&#x27;S OUTTA HERE!!!&quot;

The following seasons, the Phillies played their first game at the newly constructed Citizens Bank Park on April 12, 2004.

===Demolition and commemoration===
On March 21, 2004, the 32-year-old stadium was imploded in 62 seconds. Frank Bardonaro, President of Philadelphia-based AmQuip Crane Rental Company, pressed the &quot;charge&quot; button and then he and Nicholas T Peetros Sr., Project Manager for Driscoll/Hunt Construction Company, pressed the &quot;fire&quot; button to trigger the implosion while Greg Luzinski and the Phillie Phanatic, the Phillies&#x27; mascot, pressed a ceremonial plunger for the fans, which did not set off any explosives. A parking lot for the current sporting facilities was constructed in 2004 and 2005 at the site.

On June 6, 2005, the anniversary of World War II&#x27;s D-Day, a plaque and monument to commemorate the spot where the stadium stood and a memorial for all veterans was dedicated by the Phillies before their game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. On September 28, 2005, the second anniversary of the stadium&#x27;s final game, a historical marker commemorating where the ballpark once stood was dedicated. In April 2006, granite spaces marking the former locations of home plate, the pitcher&#x27;s mound, and the three bases for baseball, as well as the goalpost placements for football, were added in Citizens Bank Park&#x27;s Western Parking Lot U.

Before the stadium&#x27;s implosion, The Vet&#x27;s Liberty Bell replica was removed from its perch and placed in storage. In 2019, the bell was installed outside the third base entrance of Citizens Bank Park.

===Health concerns===
In the years following demolition, an apparent cancer cluster has emerged among several former Phillies players who played at Veterans Stadium who later developed glioblastoma, a form of brain cancer. Six former Phillies who played while the team called Veterans Stadium home have died of the cancer.

According to a 2013 analysis by &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, the brain cancer rate of Phillies players while the team was at Veterans Stadium was three times higher than that of the general population. Some of the speculation centers around the possibility that chemicals in the stadium&#x27;s AstroTurf field may have played a role, but there has been no research to support that theory definitively.

==Seating capacity==


==Stadium features==

The stadium was a complicated structure with its seating layered in seven separate levels in its final configuration. The lowest, or &quot;100 Level&quot;, extended only part way around the structure, between roughly the 25-yard lines for football games and near the two dugouts for baseball. The &quot;200 Level&quot; comprised field-level boxes, and the &quot;300 Level&quot; housed what were labeled &quot;Terrace Boxes&quot;. These three levels collectively made up the &quot;Lower Stands&quot;. The &quot;400 Level&quot; was reserved for the press and dignitaries; the upper level began with &quot;500 Level&quot; (or &quot;loge boxes&quot;), the &quot;600 Level&quot; (upper reserved, or individual seats), and finally, the highest, the &quot;700 Level&quot; (general admission for baseball). Originally, the seats were in shades of brown, terra cotta, orange and yellow, to look like an autumn day, but in 1995 and 1996, blue seats replaced the fall-hued ones.

At one time, the stadium could seat over 71,000 people for football, but restructuring in the late 1980s—including removal of several rows of the 700 Level around most of the stadium to accommodate construction of the Penthouse Suites—brought capacity down to around 66,000.

The stadium was harshly criticized by baseball purists. Even by multipurpose stadium standards, the upper deck was exceptionally high, and many of the seats in that area were so far from the field that it was difficult to see the game without binoculars. Like most of its contemporaries, foul territory was quite roomy. Approximately 70% of the seats were in fair territory, adding to the stadium&#x27;s cavernous feel. There was no dirt in the infield except for sliding pits around the bases, and circular areas around the pitcher&#x27;s mound and home plate. In the autumn, the football markings were clearly visible in the spacious outfield area. While the stadium&#x27;s size enabled the Phillies to shatter previous attendance records, during the years the Phillies were not doing as well, even crowds of 35,000 looked sparse.

The stadium had been known for providing both the Eagles and the Phillies with great home-field advantage. In particular, the acoustics greatly enhanced the crowd noise on the field, making it nearly impossible for opposing players to hear one another.

In his book &quot;The Secret Apartment&quot;, author Tom Garvey, who managed parking for the stadium, recalls how he spent two years residing in a space at the stadium where he was storing furniture for Eagles tight end Richard Osborne.

===700 Level===
The &quot;700 Level&quot;, the highest and cheapest seats at Veterans Stadium, became well known for being home to the loudest, rowdiest fans at Philadelphia Eagles games, and to a lesser extent, Philadelphia Phillies games. In his book &quot;If Football&#x27;s a Religion, Why Don&#x27;t We Have a Prayer?&quot;, Jereé Longman described the 700 Level as having a reputation for &quot;hostile taunting, fighting, public urination and general strangeness.&quot; Due to an improvement in public facilities, there is no equivalent in either the current Lincoln Financial Field or Citizens Bank Park. The name has also been the inspiration for websites relating to Philadelphia sports, as well as a weekly &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; section in the Sunday Sports pages of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;.

==Playing surface==

The field&#x27;s surface, originally composed of AstroTurf, contained many gaps and uneven patches. In several places, seams were clearly visible, giving it the nickname &quot;Field of Seams&quot;. It perennially drew the ranking of the &quot;NFL&#x27;s worst field&quot; in player surveys conducted by the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), and visiting players often fell prey to the treacherous conditions resulting in numerous contact and non-contact injuries. The NFLPA reportedly threatened to sue the city for the poor conditions, and many sports agents told the Eagles not to even consider signing or drafting their clients. The Eagles, for their part, complained to the city on numerous occasions about the conditions at the stadium. Baseball players also complained about the surface. It was much harder than other AstroTurf surfaces, and the shock of running on it often caused back pain.

Two of the most-publicized injuries blamed on the playing surface occurred exactly six years apart. On October 10, 1993, Chicago Bears wide receiver Wendell Davis had his cleats caught in a seam while he planted to jump for an underthrown bomb from QB Jim Harbaugh, tearing both of his patella tendons and ending his career, barring a short-lived comeback attempt with the Indianapolis Colts in 1995. On October 10, 1999, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin suffered a neck injury against the Eagles at Veterans Stadium that proved to be his final play in the NFL and led to his premature retirement.

Long before Davis&#x27; and Irvin&#x27;s injuries, Cleveland Browns standout defensive tackle Jerry Sherk contracted a near-fatal staph infection from the Veterans Stadium turf during a 1979 game. The infection forced him to miss 22 of the Browns&#x27; next 23 games and ended a run of nine and a half seasons in the Browns&#x27; starting lineup. Sherk never started again and retired in 1981.

In 2001, the original AstroTurf was eventually replaced by a new surface, NexTurf. It was far softer, and reportedly much easier on the knees. However, the city crew that installed the new turf reportedly did not install it properly, resulting in seams being visible in several places.

The first football game on the new turf was scheduled to take place on August 13, 2001, when the Eagles were to play the Baltimore Ravens in a preseason game. However, Ravens coach Brian Billick refused to let the Ravens take the field for warm-ups when he discovered a trench around an area where third base was covered up by a NexTurf cutout. City crews unsuccessfully tried to fix the problem, forcing the game to be canceled. Later, players from both teams reported that they sank into the turf in locations near the infield cutouts. The Eagles&#x27; team president Joe Banner was irate after the game, calling the stadium&#x27;s conditions &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot; and &quot;an embarrassment to the city of Philadelphia.&quot; City officials, however, promised that the stadium would be suitable for play when the regular season started.

The problem was caused by heavy rain over the weekend prior to the game, which made the dirt in the sliding pits and pitcher&#x27;s mound so soft that the cutouts covering them in the football configuration became mushy and uneven. Even when new dirt was shoveled on top, it quickly became just as saturated as the old dirt. The problem was solved by using asphalt hot mix, which allowed for a solid, level playing surface, but required a jackhammer for removal whenever the stadium was converted from football back to baseball (between August and October of each year).

In March 2023, investigative reporters from the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; bought souvenir samples of the old Veterans Stadium AstroTurf used from 1977 to 1981 and commissioned diagnostics through the Eurofins Environmental Testing laboratory. The resulting lab report linked per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS, also known as &quot;forever chemicals&quot;) to the turf. Six former Phillies who played at Veterans Stadium have died from glioblastoma, an aggressive brain cancer: Tug McGraw, Darren Daulton, John Vukovich, Johnny Oates, Ken Brett, and David West.

==Fans==
Fans who attended games at Veterans Stadium, especially for Philadelphia Eagles games, gained a reputation of being among the most vociferous in all of professional sports, especially in the notorious 700 Level, the highest seating level at Veterans Stadium prior to the construction of luxury skyboxes behind that seating area. The stadium became famous for the exuberant rowdiness of Eagles fans.

One of the more well-known examples of the fans&#x27; behavior was during the 1989 season at a follow-up game to what many called the &quot;Bounty Bowl&quot;. On Thanksgiving day, November 23, 1989, the Eagles had defeated the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium, 27–0. In that game, Cowboys placekicker Luis Zendejas suffered a concussion during a rough block by linebacker Jessie Small after a kickoff. After the game, Cowboys rookie head coach Jimmy Johnson commented that Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan instituted a bounty on Zendejas and Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman. Two weeks later, on December 10, they played the rematch dubbed &quot;Bounty Bowl II&quot; at the stadium which the Eagles won 20–10. The stadium seats were covered with snow in the stands. The volatile mix of beer, the &quot;bounty&quot; and the intense hatred for &quot;America&#x27;s Team&quot; (who finished 1–15 that season) led to fans throwing snowballs at Dallas players and coaches. Beer sales were banned after that incident for two games. A similar incident in 1995 at Giants Stadium during a nationally telecast San Diego Chargers–New York Giants game led the NFL to rule that seating areas must be cleared of snow within a certain time period before kickoff.

The Eagles fans&#x27; behavior during a 24–12 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; loss to the San Francisco 49ers in 1997 and a 34–0 loss to Dallas a year later was such that the City of Philadelphia assigned a Municipal Court Judge, Seamus McCaffery, to the stadium on game days to deal with fans removed from the stands in what was referred to as &quot;Eagles Court&quot;. Judge McCaffery would hold court in the stadium until the stadium&#x27;s closure in 2003; the Eagles&#x27; replacement stadium, Lincoln Financial Field, does not have a court, but a holding cell instead. Two years later, fans threw D-Cell batteries at St. Louis Cardinals outfielder J. D. Drew after he spurned the Phillies&#x27; offer to play with them, and wound up going back into the draft and picked by the Cardinals.

==Notable games and incidents==
*On June 25, 1971, Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hit the longest home run in stadium history in a 14–4 Pirates win over the Phillies. The spot where the ball landed was marked with a yellow star with a black &quot;S&quot; inside a white circle until Stargell&#x27;s 2001 death, when the white circle was painted black. The star remained until the stadium&#x27;s 2004 demolition.
*One of the most notable events in the stadium&#x27;s history was Game 6 of the 1980 World Series on October 21. In the game, the Phillies clinched their first world championship with a 4–1 victory over the Kansas City Royals in front of 65,838 fans. Tug McGraw&#x27;s series-ending strikeout of the Royals&#x27; Willie Wilson was instrumental in their win.
*One of the most notable Eagles games at the stadium, which occurred less than three months after the Phillies won the 1980 World Series, was Eagles 20–7 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in the 1980 NFC Championship Game, played before 70,696 fans at the stadium on January 11, 1981. As a psychological ploy, the Eagles chose to wear their white jerseys for their home game in order to force the Cowboys into their &quot;unlucky&quot; blue jerseys. At the end of the game, Philadelphia police circled the field with horses and dogs as they had done for the Phillies&#x27; World Series victory; despite the police presence, Eagles fans successfully rushed the field.
*Veterans Stadium was host to the latest-finishing game in baseball history, a twinight double-header between the Phillies and San Diego Padres that started on July 2, 1993, at 5:05 pm and ended at 4:40 am the following morning. The two games were interrupted multiple times by rain showers. The Padres won the first game, and led in the second, but lost in a come-from-behind victory for the Phillies in the tenth inning on an RBI single by Phillies closing pitcher Mitch Williams. The second game ended with an estimated 6,000 fans at the ballpark.
*The Phillies clinched the NLCS at the stadium twice: the first in 1983 over area-born Tommy Lasorda and the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the second in the 1993 NLCS over future divisional rivals the Atlanta Braves. The 1993 season was the last LCS under the two-division League format.
*The Phillies pitched two no-hit games at the stadium, the only nine-inning no-hitters in stadium history. Both were against the San Francisco Giants. Terry Mulholland pitched the first on August 15, 1990, in a 6–0 Phillies win. Kevin Millwood pitched the second on April 27, 2003, and beat the Giants 1–0, upstaging the Phillie Phanatic&#x27;s birthday promotion that afternoon. The Montréal Expos&#x27; Pascual Pérez pitched a five-inning no-hitter shortened by rain on September 24, 1988. MLB changed its rules in 1991 to require that fully recognized no-hitters—past, present and future—be complete games of at least nine innings.
*Another game that is well-remembered by Eagles fans was known as the &quot;Body Bag Game&quot;, which took place on November 12, 1990, when the Washington Redskins visited the stadium for a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game. Eagles&#x27; head coach Buddy Ryan was quoted as saying that the Redskins&#x27; offense would &quot;have to be carted off in body bags.&quot; The Eagles&#x27; number-one defense scored two touchdowns in a 28–14 Eagles win in which the Eagles knocked nine players with the Redskins out of the game, including their first and second string quarterbacks. The Redskins were forced to finish the game using running back/returner Brian Mitchell, who would become an Eagles player over a decade later at quarterback.
*During the 1998 Army–Navy Game, a serious accident occurred when a support rail collapsed and eight West Point cadets were injured, which intensified calls for new stadiums for football and baseball in Philadelphia.
*From 1979 into 1981, Tom Garvey, a stadium parking lot supervisor, Vietnam War veteran and friend of Phillies and Eagles players, lived semi-secretly (known to 25-30 people) under 300-level seats at the stadium.

==Other stadium events==
===Amateur baseball===
From 1970 to 1987, the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) played its annual all-star game at various major league stadiums. The games were interleague contests between the CCBL and the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League (ACBL). The 1984 game was played at Veterans Stadium. The CCBL won the game 7–3 behind the performance of winning pitcher and future major leaguer Joe Magrane of the University of Arizona.

The Liberty Bell Classic, Philadelphia Division I college baseball tournament, was played at the stadium from its inception in 1992 through 2003. The original eight schools were:

*Drexel University (Drexel Dragons)
*La Salle University (La Salle Explorers)
*Saint Joseph&#x27;s University (the Hawks)
*Temple University (Temple Owls)
*University of Delaware (Delaware Fightin&#x27; Blue Hens)
*University of Pennsylvania (Penn Quakers)
*Villanova University (Villanova Wildcats)
*West Chester University (West Chester Golden Rams)

In the first championship game in 1992, the University of Delaware defeated Villanova 6–2.

The stadium hosted the 1998 Atlantic 10 Conference baseball tournament, won by Fordham.

===Minor league baseball===
In November 1987, the new owners of the Phillies AAA franchise, the Maine Guides, considered playing the 1988 season at the Vet because Lackawanna County Stadium would not be ready until the 1989 season. The team would have had to play 12:35 pm day games when the Phillies had night games scheduled at the Vet. Ownership elected to remain in Old Orchard Beach for 1988, renamed the club the &#x27;Maine Phillies&#x27;, and moved to Moosic, Pennsylvania in 1989 as the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons.

The Eastern League Trenton Thunder played two home games at the stadium in April 1994. The Thunder beat the Canton–Akron Indians, 10–9, in front of 483 fans on April 20, 1994, and won 9–3 on April 21. Future Phillies broadcaster Tom McCarthy was in the booth for the Thunder during these two games.

===Soccer===
The stadium was the home field for the Philadelphia Atoms and the Philadelphia Fury, both North American Soccer League teams. The Fury drew 18,191 fans for their April 1, 1978, opener at the stadium which they lost 3–0 to the Washington Diplomats. The Fury averaged 8,279 per-match in 1978 NASL, 5,624 per-match in 1979 NASL, and 4,778 in the 1980 NASL seasons. The club was moved to Montreal in 1981 NASL season.

The stadium hosted an exhibition match on August 2, 1991, between the U.S. National Team and English professional soccer club Sheffield Wednesday F.C. John Harkes played for Wednesday, the first American to play in the English Premier League. 44,261 fans saw the U.S. score two second-half goals to defeat Sheffield Wednesday 2–0.

Philadelphia established a bid committee to host matches for the 1994 World Cup which was to be played in the United States. Phillies president Bill Giles was on the Philadelphia bid committee and hoped to use Veterans Stadium for games. In addition to the challenge of installing a natural grass field for the games, FIFA would have required the Phillies to vacate the stadium for a month to allow for sufficient preparation time prior to the matches. Giles could only offer 17-days. The nine venues eventually chosen to host matches were all stadiums that did not host baseball games.

===Professional softball===
The Philadelphia Athletics of the American Professional Slo-Pitch League (APSPL) played their 1978 seasons at Veterans Stadium.

===High school football===
Veterans Stadium hosted Philadelphia&#x27;s City Title high-school football championship game from 1973 to 1977 and in 1979. The series was suspended in 1980. With the entry of the Philadelphia Catholic League into what is now PIAA District XII (which was formed when the Public League joined the PIAA in 2002), the &quot;City Title Game&quot; was restored in 2008.

===Professional wrestling===
The only professional wrestling event held in Veterans Stadium was NWA/Jim Crockett Promotions The Great American Bash on July 1, 1986, with an attendance of 10,900. The event was the start of a 14-city summer tour.

===Concerts===
===Other events===
The venue also played host to religious events including annual Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses conventions, which was open to the public each year it took place. It also played host to a Billy Graham crusade in 1992; the crusade was held on the same day that the Eagles&#x27; Jerome Brown was killed in a vehicular crash and Reggie White, who was invited to speak at the event, broke the news to the gathered crowd.

<doc id="270676" wikidata="Q270642" url="?curid=270676" title="Irish pound">
<text>The pound (Irish: ) was the currency of Ireland until 2002. Its ISO 4217 code was IEP, and the symbol was [[£]] (or £Ir for distinction.) The Irish pound was replaced by the euro on 1 January 1999. Euro currency did not begin circulation until the beginning of 2002.

==First pound==

The earliest Irish coinage was introduced in the late 10th century, with an £sd system of one pound divided into twenty shillings, each of twelve silver pence. Parity with sterling was established by King John around 1210, so that Irish silver could move freely into the English economy and help to finance his wars in France. However, from 1460, Irish coins were minted with a different silver content than those of England, so that the values of the two currencies diverged.

During the Williamite War of 1689–1691, King James II, no longer reigning in England and Scotland, issued an emergency base-metal coinage known as gun money.

In 1701, the relationship between the Irish pound and sterling was fixed at £13 Irish to £12 sterling (The Pound Scots had yet another value; it was absorbed into sterling in 1707 at a ratio of 12 to 1.) This relationship made it possible for Irish copper coins to circulate with English silver coins, since thirteen Irish pence had the same value as one English shilling.

In 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland became part of the United Kingdom, but the Irish pound continued to circulate until January 1826. Between 1804 and 1813, silver tokens worth 10d were issued by the Bank of Ireland and were denominated in pence Irish. The last copper coins of the Irish pound were minted in 1823, and in 1826 the Irish pound was merged with the pound sterling. After 1826, some Irish banks continued to issue paper currency, but these were denominated in sterling, and no more distinctly Irish coins were minted until the creation of the Irish Free State in the 20th century.

== Second pound ==
=== pound===
From continuing to use sterling after its independence (1922), the new Irish Free State () introduced its own currency from 1928. The new Free State pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as did the sovereign at the time, having the effect of making the new currency pegged at 1:1 with sterling. rather than parity with sterling was maintained for another fifty years. As with sterling, the £sd system was used, with the Irish names (plural: ), (plural: ) and (plural: ). Distinctive coins and notes were introduced, the coins from 1928 (in eight denominations: d, d, 1d, 3d, 6d, shilling (1/–), florin (2/–), half crown (2/6) and in 1966 a 10/– coin, a commemorative piece not meant for circulation) all but the 3d and 6d had the same dimensions as their British counterparts, the Irish coins being thicker nickel coins in contrast to the thin silver ones issued in the UK. However, sterling specie generally continued to be accepted on a one-for-one basis everywhere, whereas Irish coin was not generally accepted in the United Kingdom, except in parts of Northern Ireland.

===Irish pound===
The name of the state was officially changed to &quot;Ireland&quot; (Irish: ) on the coming into force of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 December 1937. On 10 May 1938, the name of the currency became the Irish pound.

=== Decimalisation===
The &quot;Report of the Metric System and Decimal Coinage Committee&quot; (1959) was amongst the first formal reports on decimalisation of the currency, discussion continued into the 1960s on the topic. When the British government decided to decimalise its currency, the Irish government followed suit. The Decimal Currency Act 1969 replaced the traditional shilling and penny with a centesimal subdivision, the &quot;new penny&quot; (; symbol: p). The pound itself was not revalued by this act and therefore banknotes were unaffected, although the 10/– note was replaced by a 50p coin due to spiralling inflation. The new 5p coin correlated with the shilling coin, and the new 10p coin correlated with the florin coin. New coins were issued of the same dimensions and materials as the corresponding new British coins. The Decimal Currency Act 1970 made additional provisions for the changeover not related with the issue of coins.

Decimalisation was overseen by the Irish Decimal Currency Board, created on 12 June 1968. It provided changeover information to the public, including a pamphlet called &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Guide to Decimal Currency&quot;. The changeover occurred on Decimal Day, 15 February 1971.

===Breaking the link with sterling===
The European Monetary System was introduced in the 1970s. Ireland decided to join it in 1978, while the United Kingdom stayed out.

The European Exchange Rate Mechanism finally broke the one-for-one link that existed between the Irish pound and the pound sterling; by 30 March 1979 an exchange rate was introduced.

This period also saw the creation of the Currency Centre at Sandyford in 1978, where banknotes and coinage could be manufactured within the state. Before this, banknotes were printed by specialist commercial printers in England, and coins were struck by the British Royal Mint.

===1979–1999: Free-floating currency ===
Until 1986, all decimal Irish coins were the same shape and size as their UK counterparts. After this, however, all new denominations or redesigned coins were of different sizes to the UK coinage. The new 20p coin introduced that year and the £1 coin (introduced in 1990) were completely different in size, shape and composition from the previously introduced UK versions. When the UK 5p and 10p coins were reduced in size, the Irish followed suit, but the new Irish 10p was smaller than the new UK version introduced in 1992 and the new Irish 5p was slightly larger than the UK version introduced in 1990. The Irish 50p was never reduced in size (as it was in the UK in 1997).

Despite not being legal tender, British sterling coins of the same shape and size were customarily accepted in Ireland. At time of the replacement with the euro, these were the 1p, 2p and 5p (although it was not exactly the same as the British 5p).

===Replacement with the euro===


On 31 December 1998, the exchange rates between the European Currency Unit and the Irish pound and 10 other EMS currencies (all but the pound sterling, the Swedish krona and the Danish krone) were fixed. The fixed conversion factor for the Irish pound was EUR1.00 = IEP0.787564. Of the 15 national currencies originally tied to the euro (including the currencies of Vatican City, Monaco and San Marino), the Irish pound was the only one whose conversion factor was less than 1, i.e. the unit of the national currency was worth more than one euroalmost EUR1.27 in this case.

Although the euro became the currency of the eurozone countries including Ireland on 1 January 1999, it was not until 1 January 2002 that the state began to withdraw Irish pound coins and notes, replacing them with euro notes and coins. All other eurozone countries withdrew their currencies in a similar fashion, from that date. Irish pound coins and notes ceased to be legal tender on 9 February 2002. All Irish coins and banknotes, from the start of the Irish Free State onwards, both decimal and pre-decimal, may be redeemed for euros at Ireland&#x27;s Central Bank in Dublin.

<doc id="270680" wikidata="Q4856429" url="?curid=270680" title="Banknotes of the pound sterling">
<text>The pound sterling (symbol: £; ISO 4217 currency code: GBP) is the official currency of the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, British Antarctic Territory, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and Tristan da Cunha. The Bank of England has a legal monopoly of banknote issuance in England and Wales. Six other banks (three in Scotland and three in Northern Ireland) also issue their own banknotes as provisioned by the Banking Act 2009, but the law requires that the issuing banks hold a sum of Bank of England banknotes (or gold) equivalent to the total value of notes issued.

Versions of the pound sterling issued by Crown dependencies and other areas are regulated by their local governments and not by the Bank of England. Three British Overseas Territories (Gibraltar, Saint Helena, and the Falkland Islands) also have currencies called pounds which are at par with the pound sterling. Pound sterling paper banknotes were the first to be issued in Europe, printed and circulated by the Bank of Scotland in 1696.

==Currently circulating Bank of England notes==
The pound sterling banknotes in current circulation consist of Series G Bank of England notes in denominations of £5, £10, £20 and £50. The obverse of these banknotes issued through 4 June 2024 feature the portrait of Elizabeth II originally introduced in 1990. Starting on 5 June 2024, the Bank of England began issuing notes featuring a portrait of Charles III, which will circulate alongside the Elizabeth II notes and gradually replace them. Select banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland also issue their own banknotes at par with Bank of England issues. Scottish and Northern Irish notes, which are not legal tender but are promissory notes, are occasionally rejected as payment in England by merchants unfamiliar with them, and are likely difficult or impossible to exchange outside Britain.

==History==

Until the middle of the 19th century, privately owned banks in Great Britain and Ireland were free to issue their own banknotes. Paper currency issued by a wide range of provincial and town banking companies in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland circulated freely as a means of payment.

As gold shortages affected the supply of money, note-issuing powers of the banks were gradually restricted by various acts of Parliament, until the Bank Charter Act 1844 gave exclusive note-issuing powers to the central Bank of England. Under the act, no new banks could start issuing notes; and note-issuing banks gradually vanished through mergers and closures. The last private English banknotes were issued in 1921 by Fox, Fowler and Company, a Somerset bank.

However, some of the monopoly provisions of the Bank Charter Act 1844 only applied to England and Wales.
The Bank Notes (Scotland) Act 1845 was passed the following year, and to this day, three retail banks retain the right to issue their own sterling banknotes in Scotland, and four in Northern Ireland. Notes issued in excess of the value of notes outstanding in 1844 (1845 in Scotland) must be backed up by an equivalent value of Bank of England notes.

Following the partition of Ireland, the Irish Free State created an Irish pound in 1928; the new currency was pegged to sterling until 1979. The issue of banknotes for the Irish pound fell under the authority of the Currency Commission of the Republic of Ireland, which set about replacing the private banknotes with a single Consolidated Banknote Issue in 1928. In 1928, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928 reduced the fiduciary limit for Irish-bank issued sterling banknotes circulating in Northern Ireland to take account of the reduced size of the territory concerned.

Elizabeth II was not the first British monarch to have her face on UK banknotes. George II, George III and George IV appeared on early Royal Bank of Scotland notes and George V appeared on 10/– and £1 notes issued by the British Treasury between 1914 and 1928. However, prior to the issue of its Series C banknotes in 1960, Bank of England banknotes generally did not depict the monarch. Today, notes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks do not depict the monarch.

The monarch is depicted on banknotes issued by the Crown dependencies and on some of those issued by overseas territories.

==Everyday use and acceptance==
The wide variety of sterling notes in circulation means that acceptance of different sterling banknotes varies. Their acceptance may depend on the experience and understanding of individual retailers, and it is important to understand the idea of &quot;legal tender&quot;, which is often misunderstood (see section below).

In summary, the various banknotes are used as follows:
=== Bank of England banknotes === 
Most sterling notes are issued by the Bank of England. These are legal tender in England and Wales. Bank of England notes are generally accepted in the Overseas Territories which are at parity with sterling. In Gibraltar, there are examples of pairs of automatic cash dispensers placed together, one stocked with Bank of England notes, and the other with local ones.

=== Scottish banknotes ===

These are the recognised currency in Scotland, although they are not legal tender (nor are Bank of England notes). They are always accepted by traders in Scotland, and are usually accepted elsewhere in the United Kingdom. However, some outside Scotland may be unfamiliar with the notes and they are sometimes refused. Institutions such as clearing banks, building societies and the Post Office will readily accept Scottish bank notes. Branches of the Scottish note-issuing banks situated in England dispense Bank of England notes and are not permitted to dispense their own notes from those branches. Modern Scottish banknotes are denominated in sterling, and have exactly the same value as Bank of England notes; they should not be confused with the former pound Scots, a separate currency which was abolished in 1707.

=== Northern Irish banknotes ===

Banknotes issued by Northern Irish banks have the same legal status as Scottish banknotes in that they are promissory notes issued in pounds sterling and may be used for cash transactions anywhere in the United Kingdom. However, they are rarely seen outside of Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, although they might be accepted by any shop, they are often not accepted without explanation. Like Scottish notes, clearing banks and building societies will accept them. Northern Irish pound sterling banknotes should not be confused with the Irish pound (or &quot;punt&quot;), the former currency of the Republic of Ireland, which was replaced by the euro in 2002.

=== Banknotes of the Crown dependencies ===

The Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey, and the Isle of Man, are possessions of the Crown but are outside the UK; they are in currency union with the United Kingdom and issue pound sterling banknotes in local designs (Jersey and Guernsey pounds are freely interchangeable within the Channel Islands). In the United Kingdom, they are intermittently accepted by merchants. However, they are accepted by banks and post offices and the holder can exchange these notes for other sterling banknotes. They also issue their own coinage.

=== British Overseas Territories ===

There are fourteen British Overseas Territories, many of which issue their own currencies which are distinct under ISO 4217: Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, and St Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha have their own pounds which are at par with sterling. These notes cannot be used in the UK or outside the territories of origin. Falkland Island pounds are also valid in South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and the British Antarctic Territory. Saint Helena pounds, however, cannot be used in the constituent territory of Tristan da Cunha, where sterling is the only official currency.

The remaining British Overseas Territories use the Bermudian dollar, the Cayman Islands dollar, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, the Euro, the New Zealand dollar, or the United States dollar.

==Legal tender==
In the UK legal tender specifically relates to the settlement of debts: a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if they pay the exact amount into court in legal tender. Legal tender is solely for the guaranteed settlement of debts, and does not imply a right to pay with cash in other contexts. 

Banknotes do not have to be classed as legal tender to be acceptable for trade; millions of retail transactions are carried out each day in the UK using debit cards and credit cards, none of which is a payment using legal tender. Equally, traders may offer to accept payment in foreign currency, such as the euro, yen, or US dollars. Acceptability as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved. Where a transaction is subject to VAT, the transaction must be converted to sterling for tax purposes.

Millions of pounds&#x27; worth of sterling banknotes in circulation are not legal tender, but that does not mean that they are illegal or of lesser value; their status is of &quot;legal currency&quot; (that is to say that their issue is approved by the British parliament) and they are backed up by Bank of England securities.

Bank of England notes are the only banknotes that are legal tender in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are not legal tender anywhere, and Jersey, Guernsey and Manx banknotes are only legal tender in their respective jurisdictions. Although these banknotes are not legal tender in the UK, this does not mean that they are &quot;illegal&quot; under English law, and creditors and traders may accept them if they so choose. Traders may, on the other hand, choose not to accept banknotes as payment, as contract law across the United Kingdom allows parties not to engage in a transaction at the point of payment if they choose not to.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland, no banknotes, not even those issued by local banks, are legal tender. They have a similar legal standing to cheques or debit cards, in that their acceptability as a means of payment is essentially a matter for agreement between the parties involved, although Scots law requires any reasonable offer for settlement of a debt to be accepted.

Until 31 December 1984, the Bank of England issued £1 notes, and these notes did have legal tender status in Scotland and Northern Ireland while they existed. The Currency and Bank Notes Act 1954 defined Bank of England notes of less than £5 in value as legal tender in Scotland. Since the English £1 note was removed from circulation in 1988, this leaves a legal curiosity in Scots law whereby there is no paper legal tender in Scotland. HM Treasury has proposed extending legal tender status to Scottish banknotes. The proposal has been opposed by Scottish nationalists who believe it would reduce the independence of the Scottish banking sector.

Most of the notes issued by the note-issuing banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland have to be backed by Bank of England notes held by the issuing bank. The combined size of these banknote issues is well over a billion pounds. To make it possible for the note-issuing banks to hold equivalent values in Bank of England notes, the Bank of England issues special notes with denominations of one million pounds (&quot;Giants&quot;) and one hundred million pounds (&quot;Titans&quot;) for internal use by the other banks.

Banknotes are no longer redeemable in gold, and the Bank of England will only redeem sterling banknotes for more sterling banknotes or coins. The contemporary sterling is a fiat currency which is backed only by securities; in essence promissory notes from the Treasury that represent future income from the taxation of the population. Some economists term this &quot;currency by trust&quot;, as sterling relies on the faith of the user rather than any physical specie.

==Issuing banks and authorities==
The following table lays out the various banks or authorities which are authorised to print pound sterling banknotes, organised by territory:

==Bank of England notes==

In 1921, the Bank of England gained a legal monopoly on the issue of banknotes in England and Wales, a process that started with the Bank Charter Act 1844 when the rights of other banks to issue notes was restricted.

The bank issued its first banknotes in 1694, although before 1745 they were written for irregular amounts, rather than predefined multiples of a pound. It tended to be times of war, which put inflationary pressure on the British economy, that led to greater note issue. In 1759, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, when the lowest-value note issued by the Bank was £20, a £10 note was issued for the first time. In 1793, during the war with revolutionary France, the Bank issued the first £5 note. Four years later, £1 and £2 notes appeared, although not on a permanent basis. Notes did not become entirely machine-printed and payable to the bearer until 1855.

At the start of the First World War, the government issued £1 and 10/– Treasury notes to replace the sovereign and half-sovereign gold coins. The first coloured banknotes were issued in 1928, and were also the first notes to be printed on both sides. The Second World War saw a reversal in the trend of warfare creating more notes: to combat forgery, higher denomination notes (some as high as £1,000) were removed from circulation.

There are no Welsh banknotes in circulation; Bank of England notes are used throughout Wales. The last Welsh banknotes were withdrawn in 1908 upon the closure of the last Welsh bank, the North and South Wales Bank. An attempt was made in 1969 by a Welsh banker to revive Welsh banknotes, but the venture was short-lived and the notes did not enter general circulation, surviving today only as a collectors&#x27; curiosity.

All Bank of England notes issued since Series C in 1960 through June 2024 depict Elizabeth II, who was monarch at the time, on the obverse side, in full view facing left; her image also appears as a hidden watermark, facing right; recent issues have the anti-photocopier security EURion constellation around.

In September 2022, following the death of Elizabeth II, speculation arose as to precisely when the Bank of England would begin replacing banknotes with her portrait on for ones with the portrait of Charles III. After the end of the mourning period, the Bank announced that the portrait of the King intended for use on its banknotes would be released by the end of 2022. New banknotes with the portrait of the King would circulate alongside existing banknotes with the image of the late Queen for an unspecified period of time. Images of the revised notes featuring a new portrait of the King, as well as his personal cypher, were released by the Bank of England on 20 December 2022, and entered circulation on 5 June 2024. The portrait of Charles III is based on a photograph taken when he was in his early 60s.

The Bank of England has a set of criteria for choosing characters for banknotes – initially, it looks at who has previously featured, to allow for a reflection of the diversity of society. It does not accept fictional characters, or any living people with the exception of the reigning monarch, but instead aims for individuals that are both widely admired, and are considered to have made an important contribution to British society and culture. The final criterion is that the individual has an easily recognisable portrait available for use. This does not need to be a painting, as, up to 2025, there have been two sculptures and two photographs used.

===Historical figures===
===Series D===
In the mid-1960s, shortly after the introduction of Series C, the Bank of England proposed to introduce a new banknote series featuring people from British history. In addition to enhancing the appearance of banknotes, the complexity of the new designs was intended to make counterfeiting harder. The task of designing the new Series D notes was given to the Bank&#x27;s new in-house designer, Harry Eccleston, who not only designed the notes themselves, but also created three individual portraits of the Queen. It was initially envisaged that all of the denominations of notes then in circulation would be issued under Series D. To that end, a Series D 10/– note was designed, featuring Sir Walter Raleigh, and which would become the 50 pence note upon decimalisation, and intended to be the first of the new series to be issued. However, inflation had shorted the estimated lifespan of the note to roughly five months in circulation. As a result, the new note was not introduced, and the 10/- note was instead replaced with a 50p coin in 1969. Instead, the £20 note was the first Series D note to enter circulation in 1970, with William Shakespeare on the reverse.

Runaway inflation through the 1970s also considerably eroded the lifespan of the £1 note, and the Series D £1 note, featuring Sir Isaac Newton, was discontinued in 1984, having been replaced by a coin the year before, and was officially withdrawn from circulation in 1988. Nonetheless, all banknotes, regardless of when they were withdrawn from circulation, may be presented at the Bank of England where they will be exchanged for current banknotes. Other banks may also decide to exchange old banknotes, but they are under no obligation to do so.

===Series E===
When Series E was introduced in 1990, a new portrait of the Queen was commissioned based on photographs by Don Ford, one of the Bank of England&#x27;s photographers. In this portrait, intended for all of the Series E banknotes, the Queen is shown wearing the Girls of Great Britain and Ireland Tiara, Queen Alexandra&#x27;s cluster earrings and Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee necklace. Two different Series E sets were produced, each with a different set of historical figures - the first Series E banknote was the £5 featuring George Stephenson, followed by the £20 (Michael Faraday), the £10 (Charles Dickens) and the £50 (Sir John Houblon). The three lower denominations were replaced by the Series E (Variant) series, featuring Elizabeth Fry, Charles Darwin and Sir Edward Elgar; the £50 note was not replaced during this period.

===Series F===
The Series F banknotes consists of the £20 note introduced in 2007 and the £50 introduced in 2011; no £5 or £10 notes were designed for this series. Its launch was announced on 29 October 2006 by the Governor of the Bank of England. These notes were withdrawn on 30 September 2022, after which they are only exchangeable for Series G banknotes.

The first of these new notes, a £20 note, features the Scottish economist Adam Smith, the first Scot to appear on an English note. (The first non-Englishman, Anglo-Irish Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, appeared on the Series D £5 in 1971.) Smith also features on £50 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank. Previous issues of Bank of England £20 notes were known to have suffered from a higher incidence of counterfeiting (276,000 out of 290,000 cases detected in 2007) than any other denomination. The note, which also includes enhanced security features, entered circulation on 13 March 2007.

The next new Series F banknote, the £50 note, entered circulation on 2 November 2011. It is the first Bank of England banknote to feature two Britons on the reverse: James Watt (another Scotsman) and Matthew Boulton.

===Series G===

In 2011, the Bank of England announced plans to begin introducing a new set of banknotes, which were to become Series G. As part of the initial consultation, the bank obtained opinion on whether the planned new banknotes should continue to be made from banknote paper, or if they should be polymer. Having made the decision to switch to polymer banknotes, the first note of Series G, the polymer £5 note, entered circulation on 13 September 2016; the £10 note on 14 September 2017; the £20 note on 20 February 2020; and the £50 on 23 June 2021. The material used to make the banknotes is biaxially oriented polypropylene.

In April 2013, the Bank of England announced that its next planned new note issue, intended to be the £5 note in 2016, would feature former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The selection of Churchill to replace Elizabeth Fry raised some debate about the representation of women on British banknotes, with critics raising concerns that Bank of England notes would portray exclusively male figures, other than Elizabeth II who appears on every sterling coin and Bank of England note. In July 2013 it was announced that the Series F £10 note design would bear a portrait of 19th century author Jane Austen. In 2015, the Bank announced that they were accepting suggestions from the public for a figure from the visual arts to appear on the £20 note to replace Adam Smith, with the new note to be introduced in 2020. In April 2016, it was announced that J. M. W. Turner had been selected to appear on the new £20 note.

In September 2013 the Bank of England opened a period of public consultation about the introduction of polymer, or plastic, banknotes, which would be introduced into circulation from 2016 if the proposals were supported. The polymer notes will be &quot;around 15% smaller&quot; than the notes being replaced. Following the consultation, in December 2013, the Bank confirmed that plastic or polymer notes would be brought into circulation in 2016 with the introduction of the £5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill. A spokesman for LINK, the company that operates many of the cash machines in the United Kingdom, said there would need to be significant investment as machines would need to be altered to fit the polymer £5 banknotes, which would be smaller than the previous ones. The Jane Austen polymer £10 note went into circulation in September 2017. The £20 shows J. M. W. Turner (from a self-portrait), the quote &quot;Light is therefore colour&quot; from an 1818 lecture by Turner, and a view of &quot;The Fighting Temeraire&quot;.

In March 2018, the Treasury began a consultation looking at the potential withdrawal of the £50 note, as well as the one and two pence coins, on the basis that they are used significantly less than other denominations, with an additional rationale over the £50 note being the perception in the UK of its use in money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crime, despite the demand for it overseas. The Series F version was introduced in 2011, while its predecessor was in circulation for twenty years, so there was some consideration to withdrawing the £50 note entirely as a way of combatting tax evasion, and the fact that cash transactions using such a high value note are becoming increasingly rare. However, in October 2018 the Bank of England announced plans to introduce a Series G polymer £50 note, following the review by the government. The new £50 note is planned for introduction once the Series G £20 note featuring J. M. W. Turner is released. In July 2019, it was announced that the new note would feature computer pioneer Alan Turing, from a photograph taken by the Elliott &amp; Fry photographic studio in 1951, a table of formulae from Turing&#x27;s 1936 work &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem&quot;, an image of the Automatic Computing Engine Pilot machine, technical drawings of the British bombe machine, the quote &quot;This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be&quot; from an interview Turing gave to &quot;The Times&quot; on 11 June 1949, and a ticker tape showing Turing&#x27;s date of birth in binary code.

===High-value notes===
Not since 1945 have notes with a higher value than £50 been issued for general circulation by the Bank of England, although banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland still use £100 notes. However, the Bank of England does produce higher-value notes that are used to maintain parity with Scottish and Northern Irish notes. Banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks have to be backed pound for pound by Bank of England notes (other than a small amount representing the currency in circulation in 1845), and special £1 million and £100 million notes are used for this purpose. Their design is based on the old Series A notes.

==Scotland and Northern Ireland==
While provincial banks in England and Wales lost the right to issue paper currency altogether, the practice of private banknote issue has continued in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The right of Scottish banks to issue notes is popularly attributed to the author Sir Walter Scott, who, in 1826, waged a campaign to retain Scottish banknotes under the pseudonym &quot;Malachi Malagrowther&quot;. Scott feared that the limitation on private banknotes proposed with the Bankers (Scotland) Act 1826 would have adverse economic consequences if enacted in Scotland because gold and silver were scarce and Scottish commerce relied on small notes as the principal medium of circulating money. His action eventually halted the abolition of private banknotes in Scotland.

Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are unusual, firstly because they are issued by retail banks, not central banks, and secondly, as they are technically not legal tender anywhere in the UK – not even in Scotland or Northern Ireland – as they are in fact promissory notes.

Six retail banks have the authority of HM Treasury to issue sterling banknotes as currency. Despite this, the notes can be refused at the discretion of recipients in England and Wales, and are often not accepted by banks and exchange bureaus outside of the United Kingdom. This is particularly true in the case of the Royal Bank of Scotland &#x27;s £1 note, which is the only £1 note to remain in circulation within the UK.

In 2000, the European Central Bank indicated that, should the United Kingdom join the Euro, Scottish banks (and, by extension, Northern Irish banks) would have to cease banknote issue. During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the future of private banknotes in the United Kingdom was uncertain as several banks were rescued from collapse by the United Kingdom government. The Banking Act 2009 was passed to improve protection for holders of banknotes issued by the authorised banks, so that the notes would have the same level of guaranteed value to that of Bank of England notes. Critics of the 2009 Act expressed concerns that it would restrict the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland by removing many of the provisions of the earlier Acts quoted above. Under the original proposals, banks would have been forced to lodge sterling funds with the Bank of England to cover private note issue for a full week, rather than over a weekend, thereby losing four days&#x27; interest and making banknote production financially unviable. Following negotiations among the UK Treasury, the Bank of England and the Scottish banks, it was agreed that the funds would earn interest, allowing them to continue to issue their own notes.

During the public debate leading up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the question of Scotland&#x27;s future currency was discussed. Whilst the SNP advocated a currency union between an independent Scotland and the remaining United Kingdom, HM Treasury issued a statement in April 2013 stating that the present relationship with the Bank of England could be changed after independence, with the result that Scottish banks might lose the ability to issue banknotes backed by Bank of England funds.

===Scotland===
Until 1701 Scotland issued its own pound, the Pound Scots. The issuing of retail-bank banknotes in Scotland is subject to the Bank Charter Act 1844, Banknotes (Scotland) Act 1845, the Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928, and the Coinage Act 1971. Pursuant to some of these statutes, the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs publishes an account of &quot;the Amount of Notes authorised by Law to be issued by the several Banks of Issue in Scotland, and the Average Amount of Notes in Circulation, and of Bank of England Notes and Coin held&quot; in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;. See for example &quot;Gazette&quot; Issue 58254 published 21 February 2007 at page 2544.

====Bank of Scotland notes====

All Bank of Scotland notes bear a portrait of Sir Walter Scott on the front in commemoration of his 1826 &quot;Malachi Malagrowther&quot; campaign for Scottish banks to retain the right to issue their own notes. Bank of Scotland&#x27;s 2007 redesign of their banknotes are known as the &quot;Bridges of Scotland&quot; series. These notes were introduced on 17 September 2007, and show Scotland&#x27;s most famous bridges on the reverse side. The &quot;Bridges of Scotland&quot; series is currently being refreshed with the issue of new polymer notes with designs that follow the same basic theme of &quot;bridges&quot;. The previous &quot;Tercentenary&quot; series notes are being withdrawn from circulation and replaced with the 2007 series (or polymer series as these are issued), but remain legal currency. 
Following the announcement that HBOS (Bank of Scotland&#x27;s parent company) would be taken over by Lloyds TSB in September 2008, it was confirmed that the new banking company would continue to print bank notes under the Bank of Scotland name. According to the Bank Notes (Scotland) Act 1845, the bank could have lost its note-issuing rights, but by retaining headquarters within Scotland, banknote issue will continue.

====Royal Bank of Scotland notes====
As of August 2017, the Royal Bank of Scotland is in the process of adopting a new series of banknotes. These will be made of polymer. Two (the £5 and £10 notes) have already been released, whilst a new £20 note is being designed. The £5 note shows Nan Shepherd on the obverse accompanied by a quote from her 1977 book &quot;The Living Mountain&quot;, and the Cairngorms in the background. The reverse displays two mackerel, with an excerpt from the poem (The Choice) by Scottish Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean. The obverse of the £10 note shows Mary Somerville, with a quote from her work &#x27;The Connection of the Physical Sciences&#x27;, and Burntisland beach in the background. The reverse displays two otters and an excerpt from the poem &#x27;Moorings&#x27; by Norman MacCaig. The obverse of the £20 note, to be introduced in 2020, will show Catherine Cranston.

The previous series of Royal Bank of Scotland notes, originally issued in 1987, remains in circulation, although it is now in the process of being replaced by polymer notes. On the front of each note is a picture of Lord Ilay (1682–1761), the first governor of the bank, based on a portrait painted in 1744 by the Edinburgh artist Allan Ramsay. The front of the notes also feature an engraving of the bank&#x27;s former headquarters in St. Andrew Square, Edinburgh. The background graphic on both sides of the notes is a radial star design which is based on the ornate ceiling of the banking hall in the old headquarters building. On the back of the notes are images of Scottish castles, with a different castle for each denomination.

Occasionally the Royal Bank of Scotland issues commemorative banknotes. Examples include the £1 note issued to mark the 150th Anniversary of the birth of Alexander Graham Bell in 1997, the £20 note for the 100th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2000, the £5 note honouring veteran golfer Jack Nicklaus in his last competitive Open Championship at St Andrews in 2005, and the £10 note issued in commemoration of HM Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. These notes are much sought-after by collectors and they rarely remain long in circulation.

====Clydesdale Bank notes====
Clydesdale Bank has three series of banknotes in circulation at present. The most recent set of notes, the &quot;Polymer&quot; Series started coming into circulation in March 2015, when the Clydesdale Bank became the first bank in Great Britain to issue polymer banknotes. The £5 commemorative notes, issued to mark the 125th anniversary of the construction of the Forth Bridge, contain several new security features including a reflective graphic printed over a transparent &quot;window&quot; in the banknote. Further notes in the polymer series will be introduced over time, replacing the previous paper notes.

The polymer notes continue the theme of the &quot;World Heritage&quot; Series of paper banknotes, introduced in autumn 2009. The new notes each depict a different notable Scot on the front and on the reverse bear an illustration of one of Scotland&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Banknotes of the earlier &quot;Famous Scots&quot; Series portray notable Scottish historical people along with items and locations associated with them.

The Clydesdale Bank also occasionally issues special edition banknotes, such as a £10 note celebrating the bank&#x27;s sponsorship of the Scotland team at the 2006 Commonwealth Games

===Northern Ireland===

In Northern Ireland, three retail banks exercise their right to issue pound sterling notes: Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank (formerly Northern Bank) and Ulster Bank. , Northern Bank and Ulster Bank are the only two banks that have issued special commemorative notes so far.

Until June 2020, First Trust Bank (formerly Allied Irish Banks and now AIB (NI)) issued their own banknotes but no longer do so.

====Bank of Ireland notes====

Like other banks in Northern Ireland, Bank of Ireland retains its note-issuing rights from before the partition of Ireland; while Bank of Ireland is headquartered in Dublin, it issues sterling notes within the United Kingdom. In spite of its name, Bank of Ireland is not, and never has been, a central bank; it is a retail bank. Its sterling notes should not be confused with banknotes of the former Irish pound which were in use in the Republic of Ireland before the adoption of the euro in 2001.

Banknotes issued by Bank of Ireland are of a uniform design, with denominations of £5, £10 £20, £50 and £100 each differentiated by colour. The notes all feature an illustration of a seated woman, Hibernia, and the heraldic shields of the Counties of Northern Ireland. Until April 2008, all Bank of Ireland notes featured an illustration of Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast on the reverse side. A new series of £5, £10 and £20 notes issued in April 2008 depicts the Old Bushmills Distillery and these new notes will gradually replace the previous series as older notes are withdrawn from circulation. In 2019 the Bank of Ireland released new Polymer banknotes with the same design as their paper counterparts but the same size as the Bank of England equivalents.

====First Trust Bank====

Until June 2020, First Trust Bank issued notes in denominations of £10, £20, £50 and £100. The notes bear portraits of generic Northern Irish people on the front with varied illustrations on the reverse. Until 1993 the bank issued notes under its former trading name, Allied Irish Banks.
In February 2019, First Trust announced it would stop issuing its own banknotes, with the final withdrawal on 30 June 2020. Any notes still in circulation remained legal currency until 30 June 2022, after which they could be exchanged for other sterling notes at branches of the bank.

====Danske Bank====
In 2012, Northern Bank adopted the name of its Copenhagen-based parent company Danske Bank Group and rebranded its retail banking operation. In June 2013 the bank issued a new series of £10 and £20 notes bearing the new brand name; at the same time it also announced that it would cease production of £50 and £100 notes. Older notes bearing the Northern Bank name will continue in circulation for some time as they are gradually withdrawn, and remain acceptable forms of payment. In spite of the Danish name on the new notes, banknotes issued by Danske Bank are sterling notes and should not be confused with banknotes of the Danish krone issued by the Danmarks Nationalbank, Denmark&#x27;s central bank.

Danske Bank does not issue £5 notes, but a special commemorative £5 note was issued by the Northern Bank to mark the Year 2000; it was a polymer banknote, printed on synthetic polymer instead of paper. It is the only one of the bank&#x27;s pre-2004 notes still in circulation; all others were recalled following the £26.5 million pound robbery at its Belfast headquarters in 2004.

As of 2019, Danske Bank only issues the £10 and £20 denominations.

====Ulster Bank====

Ulster Bank notes all feature a vignette of three Northern Ireland views: the Mourne Mountains, the Queen Elizabeth Bridge and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. Notes issued from 1 January 2007 feature the Royal Bank of Scotland &quot;daisy wheel&quot; logo.

In November 2006, Ulster Bank issued its first commemorative banknote – an issue of one million £5 notes commemorating the first anniversary of the death of Northern Irish footballer George Best.

In June 2018, Ulster Bank announced the introduction of a new series of polymer banknote designs, the first in the United Kingdom to have a vertical orientation. The new series was designed around the theme &quot;Living in Nature&quot;, highlighting Northern Ireland&#x27;s botanical, zoological and geographical features. The first announced were the five-pound note, featuring images of Strangford Lough, the Brent goose and the fuchsia, was designed using the theme of &quot;migration&quot;, while the ten-pound note, which carries the theme of &quot;growth&quot;, features Lough Erne, the Irish hare and the Guelder-rose. In August 2019, the design of the new twenty-pound note was revealed, with the idea of Northern Ireland as &#x27;dwelling place&#x27;, and images including Lough Neagh, the European eel and the Hawthorn flower.

As part of the transfer of the business of Ulster Bank Limited to National Westminster Bank PLC that was completed on 3 May 2021, in 2020 the right to issue banknotes was transferred from Ulster Bank Limited to National Westminster Bank PLC.

==Channel Islands==
The Channel Islands are grouped for administrative purposes into the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey. The islands are not part of the United Kingdom but are dependencies of the British Crown and in currency union with the UK. Both Jersey and Guernsey issue their own banknotes. These notes circulate freely between the two territories, so Jersey notes are commonly used in Guernsey, and vice versa. Private banknotes are no longer in circulation in the Channel Islands. These notes are legal tender in their jurisdictions but are not legal tender in the UK.

The Government of Alderney (a part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey) is also licensed to issue its own currency, the Alderney pound, but only mints special commemorative sterling coins and does not issue banknotes.

===States of Jersey notes===
The current series of notes entered circulation on 29 April 2010. The obverse of the notes includes a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II based on a photograph by Mark Lawrence, alongside a view of an important Jersey landmark, with text in English. The reverse of each note includes an image of one of Jersey&#x27;s numerous historic coastal defence towers, built in the late 18th century, as well as a further image of cultural or landscape importance, images of the twelve parish crests, and with denomination worded in French and Jèrriais. The watermark is a Jersey cow, and further security features include a see-through map of Jersey, and on the £10, £20 and £50 a patch hologram showing a varying image of the coat of arms of Jersey and the Island of Jersey on a background pattern of La Corbière lighthouse. On 1 June 2012, a £100 note was issued to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

The previous series, gradually being withdrawn from circulation in 2010, depicted Queen Elizabeth II on the front and various landmarks of Jersey or incidents in Jersey history on the reverse.

===States of Guernsey notes===
The Guernsey pound is legal tender in Guernsey, but also circulates freely in Jersey. It is a sterling pound but the word &quot;sterling&quot; is omitted on banknotes, as on the English ones. Guernsey banknotes can also be exchanged in banks and in bureaux de change, although it has been reported that British banks no longer accept £1 Guernsey banknotes because they no longer have the facility for handling £1 UK banknotes (which are only issued in Scotland).

In addition to coins, the following banknotes are used:
* £1 note, green, Daniel De Lisle Brock, Bailiff of Guernsey (1762–1842) and Royal Court, St Peter Port (1840) on front and the Market, St Peter Port on back
* £5 note, pink, Queen Elizabeth II and the Town Church, St Peter Port on front, and Fort Grey and Hanois Lighthouse (1862) on the back
* £10 note, blue/orange, Queen Elizabeth II and Elizabeth College, St Peter Port on the front and Saumarez Park, Les Niaux Watermill, Le Trepied Dolmen on the back
* £20 note, pink, Queen Elizabeth II and St James Concert Hall, St Peter Port on the front and Vale Castle and St Sampson&#x27;s Church on the back
* £50 note, light brown, Queen Elizabeth II and the Royal Court House on the front and St Andrew&#x27;s Church and La Gran&#x27;mère on the back

==Isle of Man==
The Isle of Man Government issues its own banknotes and coinage, which are legal tender in the Isle of Man. Manx pounds are a local issue of sterling, but the word &quot;sterling&quot; does not appear on the banknotes. These notes can be exchanged in banks and in bureaux de change in the United Kingdom.

The front of all Manx banknotes features images of Queen Elizabeth II (not wearing a crown: she was only Lord of Mann on the island) and the Triskeles (three legs emblem). Each denomination features a different scene of the island on its reverse side:
* £1 – Tynwald Hill
* £5 – Castle Rushen
* £10 – Peel Castle
* £20 – Laxey Wheel
* £50 – Douglas Bay

==British overseas territories==

Three British overseas territories use their own separate currencies denominated in pounds which are at par with the pound sterling. The governments of these territories print their own banknotes which in general may only be used within their territory of origin. Bank of England notes usually circulate alongside the local note issues and are accepted as legal currency.

===Gibraltar===
In Gibraltar, banknotes are issued by the Government of Gibraltar. The pound was made sole legal tender in 1898 and Gibraltar has issued its own banknotes since 1934. The notes bear an image of the British monarch on the obverse and the wording &quot;pounds sterling&quot;, meaning that more retailers in the UK will accept them.

===Falkland Islands===

The Falkland Islands pound is the currency of the Falkland Islands. Banknotes are issued by the Falkland Islands Government. The illustrations on all notes are the same, featuring the British monarch, wildlife and local scenes; denominations are distinguished by the size and colour of the notes.

===St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha===

St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha&#x27;s constituent territories of Saint Helena and Ascension Island use the Saint Helena pound. Banknotes in these areas are issued by the Saint Helena Government and bear the image of the British monarch.

==Counterfeiting==
According to the central banks, the ratio of counterfeited bank notes is about 10 in one million for the Swiss franc, 50 in one million for the euro, 100 in one million for United States dollar and 300 in one million for sterling.

<doc id="270694" wikidata="Q970584" url="?curid=270694" title="Touch football (American)">
<text>Touch football is an amateur variant of American football and Canadian football. The basic rules are similar to those of the mainstream game (called &quot;tackle football&quot; for contrast), but to end a down, the person carrying the ball need only be touched, instead of tackled, by a member of the opposite team. This rule change gave the game its name, to differentiate it from other variants. It is similar to street football, another amateur variant, however in street football full contact is allowed.

==Rules==
The rules of the game can vary in similarity to traditional American or Canadian football depending on the skill of the players, the available playing field, and the purpose of the game. Touch football can be played by teams of as few as two or as many as twelve on each side; usually, games consist of teams of four to seven.

Positions in touch football are far less formal than its more organized counterpart. While some games roughly follow conventions, more often, all players will be considered eligible receivers (as in six-man football), and there are usually no running backs. There may or may not be a snapper; if there is not, the quarterback initiates play by hovering the ball above the line of scrimmage and pulling it backward to simulate a snap.

Some games will implement a &quot;blitz count&quot;, or a period of time that must elapse after the snap before the defense may cross the line of scrimmage in order to attempt to tackle the quarterback. This gives the quarterback time to complete a pass in the absence of effective blocking (when teams are small, there is often no blocking at all). Other games will not use a count and thus blocking becomes important. Conversely, in the presence of a &quot;blitz count&quot; there is also often a &quot;QB sneak&quot; rule, which prevents the quarterback from crossing the line of scrimmage before the blitz count is finished to prevent taking advantage of the count.
Because of these rules, passing plays are far more common than running plays in touch football.

Along with the size of the teams, the size of the field can vary considerably. Many games are played in the front and back yards of suburban and rural village neighborhoods, where the whole field may not be much more than ten to thirty yards long. In most of these situations, there are no yard lines, requiring some change in the definition of a first down. Instead of requiring that a team advance the ball ten yards, sometimes two pass completions result in a first down. Another option is to eliminate first downs, so that a team gets four (sometimes five) chances to score; this process is most desirable on shorter fields. Longer playing fields can be found in parks and spring-practice situations. 

When an odd number of players are playing, it is common to allow one player to be an &quot;all-time Quarterback&quot; player; this player will always be on the offense or the kicking team, switching sides throughout the game. This is often better known as a &quot;Steady Quarterback&quot; or &quot;Steady Q&quot;. When this occurs, there is usually no blitz count, and the all-time quarterback is usually never allowed to cross the line of scrimmage.

Another common variation is the elimination of the field goal and extra point kick; this is usually due to the absence of goal posts and tees on the field. Some games eliminate kicking altogether, directing the teams to start each possession after a touchdown at the twenty-yard line, as if a kickoff and touch back had just occurred; other players prefer to change the kickoff into a &quot;throw-off&quot; or a &quot;punt-off.&quot;

Scoring and game timing are much different in touch football than its more organized counterpart. For simplicity, touchdowns are usually worth 1 point and no other scoring is counted (there are no extra point and field goal attempts). This scoring method does not allow for other scoring types such as safeties. In a much lesser-used variation, a touchdown is worth 6 points, and the player who scored the touchdown can earn a two-point conversion by progressing from the end zone in which they had just scored back to the opposite end zone without being touched. There is usually no game clock and the game ends when one opponent has reached 10 touchdowns (in the former convention) or 100 points (in a standard convention).

==Variable rules==
===Kickoff===
Change of possession after scoring is often accompanied by rules determining where the ball is thrown from as opposed to actually kicking since throwing offers more control to players who are not playing on standard football fields. When the kickoff style is open to variance after each score, the desired rules are called out and whichever is heard first, is the accepted rule. When the rules are agreed on before the start of a game and are made to be steady throughout, they are referred to as Auto-. The most accepted Auto- rules are Half Court, In Hands-- this offers a rule that gives advantages to both the kicking and receiving teams.

===First touch===
In games without a blitz count, they may use the first touch rule to control the action of the offensive team&#x27;s current quarterback. When teams are even, a &quot;shift&quot; (hand-off) between two offensive players begins the play. It takes a touch from a defender assigned to the quarterback (the &quot;first touch&quot;) to stop initial forward progress and determine where the ball will be thrown from. The assigned defender is stuck to the quarterback, unable to act as a pass defender or to hinder the quarterback&#x27;s search of a receiver.

Depending on the group, first touch can refer to the quarterback&#x27;s ability to run or walk after the shift. For example, one group may refer to first touch as the ability of the quarterback to run after the shift, get touched, and still throw the ball. Another group may use the rule to mean that the quarterback has the ability to walk or power walk forward, get touched, and throw. The first variation favors a game with many players, while the second may be best for games where there are not many players.

Another addition to this rule is the &quot;two-man touch,&quot; which penalizes the defense for being unaware of their assignments and teammates by making all players who touch the active quarterback stick to the player, removing a defender from the field temporarily.

This rule is commonly and informally referred to &quot;first taught,&quot; the result of players creating another past tense verb for &quot;touch.&quot;

===Hand Touch===
As the name suggests, this rule determines the number of hands that must land on an offensive player simultaneously to stop the play/first touch situation. One-hand touch is often used with younger players, as two-hand touch demands greater dexterity. When used against more mature players, one-hand touch puts more pressure on the offense to juke and misdirect the defense. A variant called &quot;rough touch&quot; is also sometimes used, in which the defensive player must place both hands on the ball carrier with sufficient force to lightly shove him in order to stop the play. This is somewhat subjective, but tends to reduce the frequency of disputed touches.

===No/Half Court===
In Half Court, the ball is kicked off at the halfway mark in the field. In No Half Court, the ball is expected to be thrown from the kicking team&#x27;s goal line. Half Court is practical when playing on a long field, but it puts the kicking team closer and potentially limits the maneuverability of the receiving team. Half Court is preferred by kicking teams as it dramatically shortens the amount of space and time between the teams.

===No/In Hands===
In Hands means that the ball will be thrown to any specific person, usually at the kicker&#x27;s discretion. No In Hands means that the ball will be thrown in the general area of the team, but without a target. In Hands saves the receiving team the trouble of chasing a bobbling ball, and is preferred.

===First Down===
Rules on first downs vary depending on the playing group and field size. In shorter fields, it may be impractical or unnecessary to create landmarks which would reset the downs, as four downs should be all the time needed to go from one end to the other. However, longer fields may need a halfway marker which, when reached, would reset the downs. Multiple markers can be used in this way depending on the field length. As stated above, a number of completed passes may also result in a first down, if the teams desire it so. It is uncommon to see both length-based and pass-based rules in use simultaneously.

===Extra Points===
Some games count touchdowns as 1 point each. However, if traditional scoring is desired and no goal posts are available, teams have the option of using &quot;automatic&quot; extra points. After a touchdown (6 points), teams can choose whether to automatically earn an extra point (for 7 total), or risk the extra point and attempt a 2-point conversion (for 8 total).

===Field Goals===
If traditional scoring is desired and no goal posts are available, teams can implement a &quot;field goal zone&quot; close to the endzone. Anytime a team is within this zone, they may elect to automatically score 3 points and kickoff to the other team. This gives teams a choice whether to risk going for the touchdown, or take the free points.

===Safeties===
If traditional scoring is used, teams score 2 points for a safety, and then receive the ball off of a free kick. However, if simplified &quot;1 point-per-touchdown&quot; scoring is used, this creates a dilemma. Solutions are to score 1/2 point or 1 full point for the safety and receive the ball off of a free kick; or have the safety result in a &quot;turnover&quot; to the opposite team, with the ball placed near the goal line. 

Used by organized tackle football teams during practice, touch football reduces the risk of injury and can be played safely by people of different athletic abilities and sizes.

== Touch football organizations ==
With the first edition published in 1983, the National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association maintains a rule book for flag and touch football collegiate play.

In 1988 the United States Flag &amp; Touch Football League (USFTL) was established in Cleveland, Ohio.

<text>Dorotea Budimir (; born 16 April 1961), better known as Doris Dragović () or simply Doris, is a Croatian singer who has represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 with the song &quot;Željo moja&quot;, finishing 11th with 49 points, and Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999 with the song &quot;Marija Magdalena&quot;, finishing fourth with 118 points.

== Career ==
Dorotea Dragović was born in Split, Croatia, then part of Yugoslavia, and had an interest in singing since her childhood. She cites Arsen Dedić, Gabi Novak and Tereza Kesovija as her biggest influences and childhood idols. She came to regional prominence in the early 1980s as a member of musical group More, and began her solo career in 1986. The same year, she represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986 in Bergen with the song &quot;Željo moja&quot;, and finished 11th with 49 points. Dragović has since been one of the most famous pop singers in Yugoslavia, later Croatia and its region.

In 1999 Dragović was chosen to represent Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, after she won the national election HRT Dora with her dramatic song &quot;Marija Magdalena&quot;, written by prominent Croatian songwriter Tonči Huljić. Dragović placed a respectable fourth in Jerusalem, despite having been drawn early in the singing order, sometimes cited as a disadvantage. Her performance also included the removal of some of her clothing – seen jocularly as a staple of Eurovision performances – and was well received in the first contest in which most countries allocated their points after a public telephone vote. This remains one of Croatia&#x27;s best results at the contest. &quot;Marija Magdalena&quot; was also a radio hit on Greek radio station FLY FM 89,7 and reached number one on its airplay.

== Personal life ==
Dragović was known in the early 1980s for her work with bands from Split. One of her best known singles &quot;Hajde da se mazimo&quot; was one of the most interesting pop songs of the decade called the &quot;golden eighties&quot;. She is a known supporter of Torcida, fans of Hajduk Split football club. In 2001, Dragović received threats from Torcida supporters after she sang to Montenegrin prime minister Milo Đukanović at the 2000 New Year&#x27;s Even party.

Since 1990, Dragović is married to a former water polo player, Mario Budimir, with whom she has a son named Borna (b. 1990).

<text>Proteles is a genus of distinctive hyenas which contain the aardwolf &quot;(Proteles cristatus)&quot; and its close fossil relatives. It is the only extant genus of the subfamily Protelinae.

While the oldest fossils definitely belonging to &quot;Proteles&quot; date back to the Pliocene, material from the Miocene dating to around 10 million years ago has been suggested to belong to the genus, which would significantly increase its temporal range.

It has been suggested that the Proelinae subfamily may actually be an offshoot of the &quot;running hyenas&quot; (such as &quot;Lycyaena&quot;) who adapted to an insectivorous diet due to increased competition from canines and felines.

<doc id="270703" wikidata="Q650807" url="?curid=270703" title="Touchdown">
<text>A touchdown (abbreviated as TD) is a scoring play in gridiron football. Scoring a touchdown grants the team that scored it 6 points. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing the football into the opponent&#x27;s end zone. More specifically, a touchdown is when a player is in possession of the ball, any part of the ball is in the end zone they are attacking, and the player is not down.

Because of the speed at which football happens, it is often hard for an official to make the correct call based on their vantage point alone. Most professional football leagues, such as the National Football League (NFL) and the Canadian Football League (CFL), as well as some college leagues, such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), allow certain types of plays to be reviewed. Among these plays are touchdowns, as well as all other scoring plays, dangerous or unsportsmanlike conduct by players or staff, out-of-bounds calls, the place on the field where the official spots the ball after a play, and turnovers. Coaches can also challenge calls, provided they are made during a play eligible to be reviewed; the only exception is during periods of the game where coaches&#x27; challenges are restricted, such as the last two minutes of each half. The NFL and CFL review all scoring plays and turnovers regardless of whether the call was questionable, and therefore do not allow coaches to challenge those plays, either. The NCAA allows Division I FBS teams to review plays throughout the regular season and postseason, while Division I FCS teams can only use it during the playoffs, Division II teams only during the quarterfinals, semifinals, and championship game, and Division III teams only during the semifinals and championship game.

In American football and Canadian football, a touchdown is worth six points and is followed by an extra point or two-point conversion attempt.

==Description==
To score a touchdown, one team must take the football into the opposing team&#x27;s end zone. In all gridiron codes, the touchdown is scored the instant the ball touches or &quot;breaks&quot; the plane of the front of the goal line (that is, if any part of the ball is in the space on, above, or across the goal line) while in the possession of a player whose team is trying to score in that end zone. This particular requirement of the touchdown differs from other sports in which points are scored by moving a ball or equivalent object into a goal where the whole of the relevant object must cross the whole of the goal line for a score to be awarded. The play is dead and the touchdown scored the moment the ball touches plane in possession of a player, or the moment the ball comes into possession of an offensive player in the end zone (having established possession by controlling the ball and having one or both feet depending on the rules of the league or another part of the body, excluding the hands, touch the ground). The slightest part of the ball touching or being directly over the goal line is sufficient for a touchdown to score. However, only the ball counts, not a player&#x27;s helmet, foot, or any other part of the body. Touching one of the pylons at either end of the goal line with the ball constitutes &quot;breaking the plane&quot; as well.

Touchdowns are usually scored by the offense by running or passing the ball. The former is called a &quot;rushing touchdown&quot;, and in the latter, the quarterback throws a &quot;touchdown pass&quot; or &quot;passing touchdown&quot; to the receiver, who either catches the ball in the field of play and advances it into the end zone, or catches it while already being within the boundaries of the end zone; the result is a &quot;touchdown reception&quot; or &quot;touchdown catch&quot;. However, the defense can also score a touchdown if they have recovered a fumble or made an interception and return it to the opposing end zone. Special teams can score a touchdown on a kickoff or punt return, or on a return after a missed or blocked field goal attempt or blocked punt. In short, any play in which a player legally carries any part of the ball over or across the opponent&#x27;s goal line scores a touchdown, as is any play in which a player legally gains possession of the ball while it is on or across his opponent&#x27;s goal line and both the player and ball are legally in-bounds - beyond this, the manner in which he gained possession is inconsequential. In the NFL, a touchdown may be awarded by the referee as a penalty for a &quot;palpably unfair act&quot;, such as a player coming off the bench during a play and tackling the runner, who would otherwise have scored.

A touchdown is worth six points. The scoring team is also awarded the opportunity for an extra point or a two-point conversion. Afterwards, the team that scored the touchdown kicks off to the opposing team, if there is any time left in the half. In most codes, a conversion is not attempted if the touchdown ended the game and the conversion cannot affect the outcome.

The officials&#x27; hand signal for a touchdown is both arms extended vertically above the head, with palms facing inward—the same signal used for a field goal or conversion.

Unlike a try scored in rugby, and contrary to the event&#x27;s name, the ball does not need to touch the ground when the player and the ball are inside the end zone. The term &quot;touchdown&quot; is a holdover from gridiron&#x27;s early days when the ball &quot;was&quot; required to be touched to the ground as in rugby, as rugby and gridiron were still extremely similar sports at this point. This rule was changed to the modern-day iteration in 1889.

==History==

When the first uniform rules for American football were enacted by the newly formed Intercollegiate Football Association following the 1876 Rugby season, a touchdown required touching the ball to the ground past the goal line, and counted for of a kicked goal (except in the case of a tie) and allowed the offense the chance to kick for goal by placekick or dropkick from a spot along a line perpendicular to the goal line and passing through the point where the ball was touched down, or through a process known as a &quot;punt-out&quot;, where the attacking team would kick the ball from the point where it was touched down to a teammate. If the teammate could fair catch the ball, he could follow with a try for goal from the spot of the catch, or resume play as normal (in an attempt to touch down the ball in a spot more advantageous for kicking). The governing rule at the time read: &quot;A match shall be decided by a majority of touchdowns. A goal shall be equal to four touchdowns; but in case of a tie a goal kicked from a touchdown shall take precedence over four touchdowns.&quot;
* In 1881, the rules were modified so that a goal kicked from a touchdown took precedence over a goal kicked from the field in breaking ties.
* In 1882, four touchdowns were determined to take precedence over a goal kicked from the field. Two safeties were equivalent to a touchdown.
* In 1883, points were introduced to football, and a touchdown counted as four points. A goal after a touchdown counted as two points.
* In 1889, the provision requiring the ball to actually be touched to the ground was removed. A touchdown was now scored by possessing the ball beyond the goal line.
* In 1897, the touchdown scored five points, and the goal after touchdown added another point - hence the current terminology: &quot;extra point&quot;.
* In 1900, the definition of touchdown was changed to include situations where the ball becomes dead on or above the goal line.
* In 1912, the value of a touchdown was increased to six points. The end zone was also added. Before the addition of the end zone, forward passes caught beyond the goal line resulted in a loss of possession and a touchback. The increase from five points to six did not come until much later in Canada, and the touchdown remained only five points there until 1956. In addition, the score continued to commonly be called a &quot;try&quot; in Canada until the second half of the twentieth century.

The ability to score a touchdown on the point-after attempt (two-point conversion) was added to NCAA football in 1958 and also used in the American Football League during its ten-year run from 1960 to 1969. It was subsequently adopted by high school football in 1969, the CFL in 1975 and the NFL in 1994. The short-lived World Football League, a professional American football league that operated in 1974 and 1975, gave touchdowns a seven-point value.

<text>A betting exchange is a marketplace for customers to bet on the outcome of discrete events. Betting exchanges offer the same opportunities to bet as a bookmaker with a few differences. Gamblers can buy (also known as &quot;back&quot;) and sell (also known as &quot;lay&quot;) the outcome, and they can trade in real-time throughout the event, either to cut their losses or lock in profit. Bookmaker operators generate revenue by offering less efficient odds. Betting exchanges normally generate revenue by charging a small commission on winning bets.

==History==

The first betting exchanges were Matchbook, flutter.com and Betfair. Flutter and Betfair merged in 2001 with Betfair chosen as the primary betting exchange. The flutter.com site ceased operations in January 2002. Since then Betfair has maintained a leading position in the betting exchange market. BETDAQ (which also traded as the &#x27;Ladbrokes Exchange&#x27;) is believed to be the second largest betting exchange and it had an estimated 7% share of the betting exchange market in 2013. BETDAQ was owned by Ladbrokes plc (now Ladbrokes Coral) following their acquisition in February 2013, but has since been sold at the end of 2021 to Exchange Platform Solutions Limited. 

==Exchanges and traditional bookmakers compared==
Most exchanges make their money by charging a commission which is calculated as a percentage of net winnings for each customer on each event, or &quot;market.&quot; Gamblers whose betting activities have been restricted by bookmakers (normally for winning too much money) are able to place bets of unrestricted size as long as one or more opposing customers are willing to match their bets. The odds available on a betting exchange are usually better than those offered by bookmakers, in spite of the commission charged, because there are smaller overrounds.

In spite of these advantages, exchanges currently have some limitations. Because exchanges seek to concentrate their liquidity in as few markets as possible, they are not currently suited to unrestricted multiple parlay betting. Betfair does offer &quot;accumulators&quot; but these are limited in number and type: users cannot determine the outcomes contained in accumulators themselves. Some exchanges such as BETDAQ also offer &quot;multiples&quot; but the exchanges act in the same manner as traditional bookmakers in doing so (i.e. they themselves and not a customer act as the layer of such bets). Exchanges also tend to restrict the odds that can be offered to between 1.01 (1 to 100) and 1000 (999 to 1).

==Backing and laying==

Traditionally betting has occurred between a customer and a bookmaker where the customer &#x27;backs&#x27; (bets that an outcome will occur) and the bookmaker &#x27;lays&#x27; (bets that the outcome will not occur). Betting exchanges offer the opportunity for anyone to both back and lay. The liability is the amount one can lose in the worst-case scenario. 

For example, if someone thinks that Team A will win the competition, they may support that choice. The bookmaker offering this bet to the player will choose this option. Both sides will agree on the sponsor&#x27;s bet and odds. If the team loses, the layer/bookmaker retains the patron&#x27;s bet. If the team wins, the layer will pay the sponsor the winnings according to the agreed odds. Since every bet you make requires a patron and a layer, and the exchange of bets is not a participant in the bets made on it, any exchange of bets requires both patrons and layers.

==In-play betting==
Exchanges allow bets to be made &quot;in-running&quot; or &quot;in-play&quot; (i.e. to make bets while a race or match is in progress). This feature is generally restricted to the most popular events for which widespread, live television coverage is available.

Whereas non-in-play bets are entered into the system immediately after being placed by the customer, when betting in-play a time delay might be instituted so as to make it somewhat more difficult for unscrupulous customers to accept offers for bets that for whatever reason have suddenly become highly favorable. Markets may also be actively managed by the operator. In this case, betting will be briefly halted after each occurrence likely to cause a substantial change in the odds (for example, in association football matches goals, penalty kicks and sendings off would warrant such suspensions), so that unmatched bets can be cancelled.

==Traders and arbitrageurs==
Arbitrageurs (colloquially &quot;arbers&quot;) attempt to simultaneously bet on all possible outcomes to make a guaranteed profit. A trader operates similarly to an arbitrageur but is willing to take on extra risk and bet on events where no immediate profit is possible. A trader hopes to make a profit by closing out the bet at a later stage at more favorable odds. Closing out a bet for profit involves collecting more money by laying than is paid out when the outcome is backed back. If the event does not occur then no money is lost, alternatively if a trader is able to lay a higher stake at shorter odds than his back stake then he can theoretically guarantee the same amount of profit regardless of the outcome. On the other hand, if the odds move against the trader he might elect to close out the bet so as to minimise his loss. Trading can be done either before the start of an event or while the event is in progress if in-play betting is offered. Compared to trading before the event commences, trading in-play usually involves both greater risk and also the potential to make more money.

Traders can make money by betting exclusively with betting exchanges or bookmakers, or by combining the two. The trader could lay at a low amount on a betting exchange and then back at a higher price with a bookie or another exchange. This must be done simultaneously to guarantee a profit or else the opportunity could quickly cease to exist with liquid markets quickly correcting prices and bookies trying to avoid being arbitraged.

Most exchanges post the book percentages (colloquially known as the overround or &quot;vig&quot;) prominently for each market. These percentages are essentially the cumulative implied percentage chances of the odds on offer for each selection and for a single winner market will usually add up to more than 100% for all back selections (but only marginally over in a competitive market), and under 100% for the lay selections. This ensures that simultaneously backing or laying all selections in a market will not normally guarantee a profit. Occasionally though (especially in circumstances where odds are prone to change rapidly) exceptions will arise where offers to back or lay all selections will be made that if simultaneously and cumulatively accepted at exactly the right stakes would permit an arbitrageur to guarantee a profit. However, such phenomena tend to correct themselves very quickly and exchanges generally try to dissuade customers from attempting to take advantage of such circumstances.

Furthermore, for a trader or arbitrageur to combine different exchanges and/or bookmakers for a profit requires a substantial price differential if a profit is in fact to be made once the exchange&#x27;s commission is taken into account. Even between exchanges, such large price differences are rare, brief and usually involve relatively small stakes. Fortunately for traders, almost all betting exchanges charge commission on net winnings only and charge no commission at all in the event of a net loss. This suits the trader&#x27;s high turnover, low profit strategy provided he bets exclusively with a single exchange.

Unless a trader is willing to accept the risks inherent with in-play trading, the profit or loss for a trader will typically be no more than 10% of the total amount of his combined back and lay stakes in any particular market, so to make meaningful amounts of money a trader needs to commit a relatively large amount of capital. The trader therefore runs the risk of having a large unwanted bet on an event if he is unable to close his position before the event starts (e.g. if there are technical problems with his Internet connection or with the exchange).

Traders and arbitrageurs are often credited with &quot;seeding&quot; markets with more competitive prices than would be present without them. However, Betfair&#x27;s imposition of a premium charge in September 2008 was seen by some as being directed at the most skilled traders, whom it is speculated trade for a loss very infrequently and thus would otherwise pay little in the way of commission. In response, rival exchanges have pledged not to introduce similar charges, perhaps in hopes of enticing traders to move their business (and capital) elsewhere.

==Controversy==
The fact gamblers can lay outcomes on the exchanges has resulted in criticism from traditional bookmakers including the UK&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; - Gala Coral Group, Ladbrokes and William Hill. These firms argue that granting &quot;anonymous&quot; punters the ability to bet that an outcome will not happen is causing corruption in sports such as horse racing since it is much easier to ensure a horse will lose a race than to ensure that it will win.

Exchanges counter that, while corruption is possible on any gambling platform, the bookies&#x27; arguments are motivated not by concern for the integrity of sport but by commercial interests. Exchanges also assert they are well aware of who their customers are and keep a complete record of all betting activity in case of enquiries, whereas high-street bookies take anonymous cash bets. Furthermore, customers can monitor the odds on the exchanges&#x27; user-friendly platforms independently. Exchanges and the authorities can be immediately alerted should suspicious betting patterns become apparent. Some exchanges have signed agreements with governing bodies of sport including the Jockey Club, with whom they insist they will co-operate fully if the latter suspects corruption to have taken place. Exchanges have co-operated with police investigations when asked to do so, sometimes leading to arrests.

<doc id="270737" wikidata="Q1587581" url="?curid=270737" title="Jack Paar">
<text>Jack Harold Paar (May 1, 1918 – January 27, 2004) was an American talk show host, writer, radio and television comedian, and film actor. He was the second host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from 1957 to 1962. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s obituary of Paar reported wryly, &quot;His fans would remember him as the fellow who split talk show history into two eras: Before Paar and Below Paar.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Paar was born in 1918 in Canton, Ohio, the son of Lillian M. (Hein) and Howard Paar. He moved with his family to Jackson, Michigan, about south of Lansing. As a child, he developed a stutter, which he learned to manage. He contracted tuberculosis when he was 14 and left school at 16.

==Career==
===Early career===
After dropping out of Jackson High School, Paar worked as a broadcaster for WIBM, a local radio station. He went on to work as a humorous disc jockey at other Midwest stations, including WJR in Detroit, WIRE in Indianapolis, WGAR in Cleveland, and WBEN in Buffalo. In his book &quot;P.S. Jack Paar&quot;, he recalled doing utility duty at WGAR in 1938 when Orson Welles broadcast his famous simulated alien invasion, &quot;The War of the Worlds,&quot; over the CBS network and its WGAR affiliate. Attempting to calm possibly panicked listeners, Paar announced, &quot;The world is &quot;not&quot; coming to an end. Trust me. When have I ever lied to you?&quot;

In 1943, Paar was drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II, which interrupted his tenure as host of WBEN&#x27;s morning show &quot;The Sun Greeter&#x27;s Club&quot;. He was assigned to the U.S.O. in the South Pacific to entertain the troops. Paar was a clever, wisecracking master of ceremonies; he narrowly escaped being disciplined when he impersonated senior officers, especially Col. Ralph Parr.

===Radio and films===

After World War II, Paar opted not to return to WBEN, instead seeking opportunities in network radio and film. He worked in radio as a fill-in on &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; show and appeared as a host of &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;, a show with a top prize of $64.

In 1947, Jack Benny, who was impressed by Paar&#x27;s U.S.O. performances, suggested that Paar serve as his 1947 summer replacement. Paar was enough of a hit on Benny&#x27;s show that Benny&#x27;s sponsor, the American Tobacco Company, decided to keep him on the air, moving him to ABC for the fall season. Paar later refused American Tobacco&#x27;s suggestion that he come up with a weekly running gag or gimmick, saying he &quot;wanted to get away from that kind of old-hat comedy, the kind being practiced by Jack Benny and Fred Allen.&quot; The show was then terminated, earning Paar the enduring image of &quot;a spoiled kid&quot;. A profile of Paar by the Museum of Broadcast Communications suggests that Paar later Benny&#x27;s mannerisms.

Paar signed as a contract player for Howard Hughes&#x27; RKO studio in the immediate postwar period, appearing as the emcee in &quot;Variety Time&quot; (1948), a low-budget compilation of vaudeville sketches. He later recalled that RKO producers had trouble figuring out what kind of screen characters he could play until one of the executives dubbed him, &quot;Kay Kyser [bandleader who had made films for RKO], with warmth.&quot; Another compared his leading man appearance with Alan Ladd. Paar projected a pleasant personality on film, and RKO called him back to emcee another filmed vaudeville show, &quot;Footlight Varieties&quot; (1951). He also appeared in the 1950 film &quot;Walk Softly, Stranger&quot;, starring Joseph Cotten. In 1951, he played Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s boyfriend in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Love Nest&quot;.

Paar returned to radio in 1950, hosting &quot;The $64 Question&quot; for one season, then quitting in a wage dispute after the show&#x27;s sponsor pulled out and NBC insisted everyone involved take a pay cut. In 1956, he gave radio one more try, hosting a disc jockey effort on ABC called &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot;. Paar once described that show as &quot;so modest we did it from the basement rumpus room of our house in Bronxville.&quot;

===Television===
Paar got his first taste of television in the early 1950s, appearing as a comic on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, and hosting two game shows, &quot;Up To Paar&quot; (1952) and &quot;Bank on the Stars&quot; (1953), before hosting &quot;The Morning Show&quot; (1954) on CBS. He had &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot; on CBS, a Monday–Friday 1–1:30 p.m. Eastern Time program that ended in May 1956. Paar guest-starred twice in 1958 on Polly Bergen&#x27;s short-lived NBC comedy/variety show, &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;.

====&quot;The Tonight Show&quot;====
With the success of Steve Allen as the first host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, NBC offered Allen his own prime-time variety hour in June 1956. Over the next seven months, Allen&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; duties were limited to three nights per week, with Ernie Kovacs hosting on Mondays and Tuesdays. Allen&#x27;s heavy workload forced him to leave &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in January 1957 and concentrate on his prime-time show. For the next six months, NBC revamped the program as &quot;Tonight! America After Dark&quot;, inspired by the network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. The new late-night program, a magazine show with various hosts in different cities, proved to be a great failure. The network soon returned to its proven formula by reviving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and hiring Paar. With Paar as host, the show became a ratings success and generated annual advertising sales as high as $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The show was initially titled &quot;Tonight Starring Jack Paar&quot;, and after 1959, it was officially known as &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot;.

Paar often was unpredictable, emotional and principled. When network censors excised a joke about a &quot;water closet&quot; (toilet) from the show&#x27;s February 10, 1960, broadcast tape before airtime without warning, Paar received national attention by walking off the program the following evening in protest, leaving announcer Hugh Downs to finish the show. Paar did not return until three weeks later after the network had apologized and permitted him to tell the joke. Paar found the everyday routine of planning a 105-minute program difficult to sustain for more than five years, and his weariness caused him to end his tenure as host. He later confided to fellow host Dick Cavett that leaving the program was the greatest mistake of his life. Paar&#x27;s final show aired on March 29, 1962, during which he derided his enemies in the press, notably gossip columnists Walter Winchell and Dorothy Kilgallen.

Near the end of the run of the show, Abel Green of &quot;Variety&quot; called Paar &quot;the most vivid personality in TV since Milton Berle became Mister Television&quot; and wrote that Paar was the first popular entertainer since the creators of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; to change the habits of a nation, influencing sales of TV sets for the bedroom.

====Prime time====
Because NBC did not want to lose Paar to another network, it offered him a Friday prime-time hour with full control of content and format. He agreed, deciding on a variation of his late-night format and titling the show &quot;The Jack Paar Program&quot;. The show, which debuted in the fall of 1962, had a global perspective, debuting acts from around the world and showing films from exotic locations. Most of the films were of travels by guests such as Arthur Godfrey or by Paar himself, including visits with Albert Schweitzer at his compound in Gabon in Central Africa and Mary Martin at her ranch near Anápolis, Goiás, Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1971/martin-brazil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/1979/girls-brazil&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Paar showed film clips of the Beatles performing (November 15, 1963) three months before their famous live appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (February 9, 1964). During the first half of 1964, a mock feud pitted Paar against his lead-in program, Englishman David Frost&#x27;s news-satire series &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;.

Paar&#x27;s prime-time show aired for three years and featured a wide variety of celebrity guests. The final segment of the series, broadcast on June 25, 1965, featured Paar sitting alone on a stool recounting a discussion that he had with his daughter about his departure. In 1998, Garry Shandling featured the clip of Paar&#x27;s farewell in the series finale of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. He left the show in part so that he could have a larger role at a local television station he had purchased in 1963, WMTW in Poland Spring, Maine, as his NBC contract prevented him from appearing on his own station; Paar would sell WMTW in 1967.

Paar continued to appear in occasional specials for NBC until 1970.

==&quot;Jack Paar Tonite&quot;==
In the late 1960s, Paar lived in Maine, where he owned and operated television station WMTW, an ABC network affiliate in Poland Spring, Maine.
Paar returned to television in January 1973 with a show titled &quot;Jack Paar Tonite&quot;, which aired one week per month as one of several rotating shows on &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Entertainment&quot;. Paar said that he was unwilling to appear more frequently and that he would not have appeared at all unless ABC had committed to keeping Dick Cavett, one of his former writers, on the air. Paar&#x27;s announcer for the program was comic actress Peggy Cass. The show featured the national television debuts of comics such as Freddie Prinze and Martin Mull. Paar stayed on the show, which was in direct competition with The &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, for one year before quitting, dissatisfied with the &quot;Wide World of Entertainment&quot; rotation scheme. Paar later expressed discomfort with developments in television media and once said that he had trouble interviewing people dressed in &quot;overalls,&quot; a reference to young rock acts.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Paar made rare guest appearances on &quot;Donahue&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (hosted by Johnny Carson, then Jay Leno), and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, as well as on Charles Grodin&#x27;s CNBC talk show. He participated in the 1987 TV retrospective show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; honoring Betty White.

===Criticism of homosexuality===
In his 1962 book &quot;My Saber Is Bent&quot;, Paar wrote in a chapter titled &quot;Fairies and Communists&quot;: &quot;There used to be a time when it looked like the Communists were taking over show business. Now it&#x27;s fairies. They operate a lot alike, actually; both have a tendency to colonize. Just as there used to be no such thing as one Communist in a play or movie, now there is no such thing as one fairy. Where you find one, you usually find a baker&#x27;s dozen swishing around. ... When I hear that some fairy is producing or directing or acting in a play, I can often name some of the rest of the cast, even if I&#x27;ve never heard it... The poor darlings, as they sometimes call themselves, are everywhere in show business. The theater is infested with them and it&#x27;s beginning to show the effects. &#x27;The New York theater is dying,&#x27; the late Ernie Kovacs complained recently, &#x27;Killed by limp wrists.&#x27;&quot; Paar also lamented the negative effects of gay men in the fashion industry: &quot;I hope that all red-blooded men will rally to my crusade to have girls look like girls again. If we show our determination I&#x27;m sure that women will throw off the tyranny of fairy designers.&quot;

In March 1973 during the run of &quot;Jack Paar Tonite&quot;, Paar addressed his remarks and challenged representatives of a pro-homosexual organization to appear on the show to explain why he &quot;and other entertainers should not call homosexuals &#x27;fairies,&#x27; &#x27;dykes&#x27;, and &#x27;fags&#x27;.&quot;

===Retrospectives===

In 1984, Paar emerged from retirement again for the Museum of Broadcasting&#x27;s &quot;Tribute to Jack Paar&quot;, making two live appearances in New York. This led to his 1986 NBC special &quot;Jack Paar Comes Home&quot;. The following year, a second special, &quot;Jack Paar Is Alive and Well&quot;, was broadcast by the network. Both were composed largely of black-and-white kinescope clips used at the tribute from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and from Paar&#x27;s primetime program, for which he maintained the copyright. Although most of Paar&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; episodes were videotaped (in color beginning in 1960), only a few episodes and clips are known to exist.

In 1997, PBS television devoted an edition of the &quot;American Masters&quot; series to Paar&#x27;s career, and in 2003 revisited the topic with another hour-long examination of his work titled &quot;Smart Television&quot;.

In 2004, a memorial for Paar was held at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City featuring Dick Cavett, Turner Classic Movies (TCM) television host Robert Osborne and Paar&#x27;s daughter Randy.

==Awards==
Paar was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Performance by a Continuing Character in a Musical or Variety Series in 1951, and nominated again in 1958 for an Emmy for Best Continuing Performance in a Series by a Comedian, Singer, Host, Dancer, M.C., Announcer, Narrator, or Panelist. He did not win either time.

==Personal life==
Paar was married twice to his first wife, Irene Paar (née Gubbins). After the first divorce, the couple remarried in 1940 in Ohio, only to divorce again. He then married his second wife, Miriam (née Wagner), in 1943, and they remained together until his death.

During the 1990s, Paar&#x27;s health began to decline steadily. He underwent triple-bypass heart surgery in 1998 and suffered a stroke in 2003. On January 27, 2004, he died at his home in Greenwich, Connecticut, at age 85, with Miriam and their daughter Randy at his bedside. Paar&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes were returned to his family.

<text>The following is a list of notable one-on-one duels or single combats in history and in legend or fiction.

==Antiquity==

*29 BC: Marcus Licinius Crassus vs. Deldo, King of the Bastarnae.

==Middle Ages==

* March 13, 624: Ali, Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn al-Harith killed Walid bin Utbah, Utbah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah and Shaybah ibn Rabi&#x27;ah in the Battle of Badr.
* 627: Ali killed Amr ibn Abd al-Wud in the Battle of Khandaq.
* Khalid ibn al-Walid during his military career fought several duels and was victorious in each one of them.
* 636: Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah killed Gregory, a Greek general in the Battle of Yarmouk on the 6th and final day of the battle.
*1014: Gunnlaugr Ormstunga and Hrafn Önundarson fought the last recorded Holmgang (Viking duel) in Iceland that ended in a draw.
*1022: Tmutarakan Prince Mstislav the Brave and Kasogs Prince Rededya.
*April 11, 1127: Galbert of Bruges recorded an event near Ypres where Herman the Iron challenged Guy Steenvorde, alleging his complicity in the assassination of Charles the Good, Count of Flanders. In the ensuing duel, Steenvorde was brutally defeated and, though dying, hanged for having been found guilty in a trial by combat.
*During the Easter of 1163 at the king&#x27;s court the feudal baron of Rayleigh Henry of Essex (also a royal constable) was accused of treason by the nobleman Robert de Montfort. The two fought a judicial duel on Fry&#x27;s Island which Henry lost and was carried off the scene by monks from Reading abbey. Having been proven guilty his estates were forfeit and he had to become a monk.
*June 23, 1314: During the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn, Robert the Bruce and his rival Henry de Bohun engaged in an isolated combat which ended with Bruce killing Bohun.
*September 8, 1380: Alexander Peresvet and Tatar champion Chelubey.
*December 29, 1386: Knights Jean de Carrouges and Jacques Le Gris fought a judicial duel in Paris, France. It began when Carrouges accused Le Gris of raping his wife Marguerite, and when the case could not be solved in court, the King of France Charles VI intervened and suggested that the two end the dispute in a duel to the death. During the melee that followed, in which both combatants fought each other in plate armor together with an assortment of weapons, Carrouges managed to wrestle the larger Le Gris to the ground, remove his head cover, and kill him, thus &quot;proving&quot; his charges.

==Early modern and modern duels==

=== Asia ===

*1593: Siamese King Naresuan slew Burmese Crown Prince Mingyi Swa in an elephant duel.
*April 14, 1612: Famous Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi dueled his rival Sasaki Kojirō on the island of Funajima. Musashi arrived late and unkempt to the appointed place. Musashi killed Sasaki with a bokken or wooden sword. He fashioned the bokken out of a boat oar on his way to the island. Sasaki&#x27;s weapon of choice was the nodachi, a long sword. In addition, on a pilgrimage, Musashi fought sixty duels, and not once was he defeated.
*1906: In Istanbul, during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II, a duel between a young Kurdish aristocrat named Abdulrazzak Bedirkhan and the chief of police of the city Ridvan Pasha occurred. The police chief was killed and subsequently the entire Bedirkhan family was exiled.
*April 14, 1920: A very well-recorded bolo duel reported internationally by &quot;Prescott Journal Miner&quot; which was known as &quot;The First Bolo Duel in Manila since the American Occupation&quot;. It happened when Filipino farmers Angel Umali and Tranquilino Paglinawan met in a vacant lot near the center of the city just before dusk to settle their feuds. Paglinawan suffered the duel with his left hand cut off. With no law against bolo fights, Umali was charged only with minor charge.

===Australia===
*1801: Captain John Macarthur dueled Colonel William Paterson, shooting him in the shoulder. Macarthur was sent back to England to be court-martialed.
*1826: Robert Wardell duelled with Australia&#x27;s (Colony of New South Wales&#x27;) first Attorney-General, Saxe Bannister. Dr Wardell had previously lost to Saxe Bannister in obtaining the Attorney-General position. A long-running feud ensued: Bannister sued Wardell for libel, with Saxe saying in a speech in open court that Wardell was the &quot;scum of London&quot;. After three shots were fired on each side without effect, Wardell&#x27;s apology was accepted.
*1827: Robert Wardell duelled with the Colonel Henry Dumaresq, the aide-de-camp and brother-in-law of the governor of New South Wales, Ralph Darling. Dr Wardell had written an article titled &quot;How-e to Live by Plunder&quot;, in which he claimed Dumaresq had leaked information to &quot;The Australian&quot;. Three shots were fired by each, and no one was injured.
*1832: William Nairne Clark (barrister, news proprietor and explorer) fought a duel at Cantonment Hill, Fremantle, Western Australia, with pistols with George French Johnson (merchant), fatally wounding him in the right hip. Clark was subsequently charged with, and acquitted of, the murder of his opponent.
*1839: Dr. Barry Cotter challenged George Arden. They fought on the racecourse at the foot of Batman&#x27;s Hill in Melbourne. Cotter fired first and missed (his bullet going through the beaver hat of his second William Meek) and Arden fired wide intentionally.
*1840: Peter Snodgrass challenged William Ryrie, following hot words at dinner on New Year&#x27;s Eve. They fought at the foot of Batman&#x27;s Hill in Melbourne. Snodgrass shot himself in the toe, whereupon Ryrie fired into the air. 
*1841: Peter Snodgrass challenged Redmond Barry, who was later a Supreme Court judge. They fought near Liardet&#x27;s Pier Hotel in Melbourne. Snodgrass discharged his pistol prematurely, and Barry fired into the air.
*1842: F. A. Powlett fought a duel with Arthur Hogue at Flemington near Melbourne. There were two exchanges of shots, but no injury save to Hogue&#x27;s coat, through which Powlett sent a ball each time.
*1846: Alexander Sprot and W. J. Campbell fought a duel over the border in South Australia (having been prevented from doing so in the Port Phillip District by a Magistrates&#x27; order). Both survived.
*1851: Major Sir Thomas Mitchell confronted Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson in Sydney. Mitchell issued the challenge because Donaldson had publicly criticised the cost of the Surveyor General&#x27;s Department. Both duellists missed.

===Canada===
*1800: John White, 39, Upper Canada&#x27;s first lawyer and a founder of the law society, was fatally shot on January 3, 1800, by a government official named John Small, who challenged him to the duel. White was alleged to have gossiped at a Christmas party that Mrs. Small was once the mistress of the Duke of Berkeley in England, who had tired of her and paid Small to marry her and take her to the colonies.
*1817: John Ridout, 18, was shot dead on July 12, 1817, at the corner of what is now Bay St. and Grosvenor St. in Toronto by Samuel Peters Jarvis, 25. The reason for the duel was unclear. On the count of two, the nervous Ridout discharged his pistol early, missing Jarvis by a wide margin. Ridout&#x27;s second, James Small (whose father survived the only other duel in York) and Jarvis&#x27; second, Henry John Boulton insisted that Jarvis be allowed to make his shot. Ridout protested loudly and asked for another pistol, but Small and Boulton were adamant that the strict code of duelling must be observed. Jarvis shot and killed Ridout instantly. Jarvis was pardoned by the courts, even though he had shot an unarmed man.
*1819: What historians have called &quot;The Most Ferocious Duel&quot; in Canadian history took place on April 11, 1819, at Windmill Point near the Lachine Canal. The opponents were William Caldwell, a doctor at the Montreal General Hospital, and Michael O&#x27;Sullivan, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. The dispute arose when Caldwell accused O&#x27;Sullivan of lacking courage. The two opponents exchanged fire an unheard-of five times. O&#x27;Sullivan was wounded twice in the process, and in the final volley, he took a bullet to the chest and hit the ground. Caldwell&#x27;s arm was shattered by a shot; a hole in his collar proved he narrowly missed being shot in the neck. Amazingly, neither participant died during the fight, although both took a long time to recover. O&#x27;Sullivan went on to become Chief Justice of the Court of King&#x27;s Bench in Montreal, and when he died in 1839, an autopsy revealed a bullet still lodged against the middle of his spine.
*1826: Rudkin versus John Philpot a duel fought in Newfoundland at St. John&#x27;s who met at West&#x27;s Farm near Brine&#x27;s Tavern at the foot of Robinson&#x27;s Hill, adjacent to Brine&#x27;s River to settle their seemingly long standing differences that was further exacerbated by the love of an Irish colleen who lived in a cottage near Quidi Vidi and a game of cards that ended in an argument over the ownership of the pot.
*1833: The last fatal duel in Upper Canada was fought in Perth, Ontario, on June 13, 1833. Two law students and former friends, John Wilson and Robert Lyon, quarrelled over remarks Lyon made about a local schoolteacher, Elizabeth Hughes. Lyon was killed in the second exchange of shots on a rain-soaked field. Wilson was acquitted of murder, eventually married Miss Hughes, became a Member of Parliament, and later a judge.
*1836: Two duelling politicians from Lower Canada were lucky to have sensible seconds. Clément-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury, a member of the Lower Canadian Legislative Assembly, insulted fellow politician Charles-Ovide Perreault. Perreault then struck de Bleury, and a duel was set. Both men were determined to settle the matter with pistols, but their seconds came up with a unique solution. The two foes would clasp hands and de Bleury would say, &quot;I am sorry to have insulted you&quot; while at the same time Perreault would say, &quot;I am sorry to have struck you.&quot; They would then reply in unison, &quot;I accept your apology.&quot; The tactic worked, and the situation was resolved without injury.
*1837: William Collis Meredith and James Scott. On Monday, 9 August 1837, at eight o’clock in the evening, Meredith (who had articled under the previously mentioned Clement-Charles Sabrevois de Bleury from 1831 to 1833) and Scott (no stranger to duels) stepped out to face one another on the slopes of Mount Royal, behind Montreal. Earlier that day, following a dispute over legal costs, Meredith had challenged Scott. Meredith chose James M. Blackwood to second him, whilst Scott&#x27;s choice was Louis-Fereol Pelletier. The pistols used were Meredith&#x27;s which he had bought in London, on a previous trip to England. On the first exchange Scott took a bullet high up in his thigh, and the duel was called to a stop. The bullet lodged itself in Scott&#x27;s thigh bone in such a way that it could not be removed by doctors, which caused him great discomfort for the rest of his days. Ironically for Scott, this was exactly where he had shot Sweeney Campbell in a duel when they were students. In the early 1850s (Scott died in 1852), when both the adversaries had become judges, one of the sights then to see was Meredith helping his brother judge up the steep Court House steps, a result of the lameness in his leg that had remained with Scott since their encounter. Meredith was later knighted and went on to serve as Chief Justice of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec.

*1873: The last duel in what is now Canada occurred in August 1873, in a field near St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland (which was not Canadian territory at the time). The duellists, Mr. Dooley and Mr. Healey, once friends, had fallen in love with the same young lady, and had quarrelled bitterly over her. One challenged the other to a duel, and they quickly arranged a time and place. No one else was present that morning except the two men&#x27;s seconds. When they had counted off the standard ten yards, they turned and fired. Dooley hit the ground immediately. Healey, believing he had killed Dooley, was seized with horror. But Dooley had merely fainted; the seconds confessed they had so feared the outcome that they loaded the pistols with blanks. Although this was a serious breach of duelling etiquette, both opponents gratefully agreed that honour had indeed been satisfied.

===China===
*During the Three Kingdoms period of China, in 195 warlord Sun Ce encountered an enemy general, named Taishi Ci, by accident when both of them were scouting the other. The two fought until the arrival of their men compelled them to break off. The result was that Sun Ce seized Taishi Ci&#x27;s weapon while Taishi Ci grabbed Sun Ce&#x27;s helmet.

Duranty&#x27;s demands for an apology were refused and so the men fought a duel with swords in the Forest of Saint-Germain-en-Laye three days later on the 23rd.

The challenge was given as soon as the House adjourned, and the parties repaired at once to a copse in Hyde Park with a brace of pistols. They fired four times, when Wilkes fell, wounded in the abdomen. His antagonist, relenting, hastened up and insisted on helping him off the ground; but Wilkes, with comparative courtesy, as strenuously urged Martin to hurry away, so as to escape arrest.

There was not enough room to pace out the full distance and when they wheeled to fire their pistols were almost touching. The Major shot the Captain in the abdomen and within a few hours he died as a result of his wound. The Major fled.

In May 1820, Scott began a series of counter-articles, which provoked Lockhart into calling him &quot;a liar and a scoundrel&quot;. In February 1820, Lockhart&#x27;s London agent, J.H. Christie, made a provocative statement, and Scott challenged him. They met on 16 February 1821, at a farm between Camden Town and Hampstead. Christie did not fire in the first round, but there was a misunderstanding between the seconds, resulting in a second round. Scott was hit in the abdomen, and died 11 days later.

There are two versions of Captain Boldero&#x27;s reply. The &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; of Wednesday 13 July, claims that he replied, &quot;that if any person in his presence, whether drunk or sober, chose to damn the Queen, he would take no notice of it; for he would be no eaves-dropper.&quot; Captain Boldero took exception to this version and wrote to several of those persons present and asked them what they thought he had said. Five of these men, all Members of Parliament, Henry Liddell, W. Thompson, Charles Douglas, Beriah Botfield, and William Cripps, all replied that his answer had not included the words, &quot;or sober.&quot; He had said that if a drunk person damned the Queen in his presence he would wait until the following morning when he was sober, and deal with the matter then. Captain Boldero then wrote to Craven Berkeley and asked him if he knew who had written to the newspaper, and Berkeley replied that he did not, but that the version in the newspaper was &quot;substantially correct.&quot; Captain Boldero replied suggesting that, &quot;either your memory must have failed you in a very extraordinary manner, or you are intentionally perverting the true facts of the case.&quot; Berkeley took exception to, essentially, being accused of lying about it, and neither man being prepared to back down or apologise they nominated their seconds. Mr Berkeley was accompanied by the Hon William Ridley-Colborne, MP, and Capt Boldero by Mr W. F. Mackenzie, MP. They met at five o&#x27;clock on the morning of Friday 15 July in the neighbourhood of Osterley Park, a large country house in West London that was then the home of George Child-Villiers, 5th Earl of Jersey.

*In October 2002, four months before the US invasion of Iraq, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan suggested U.S. President George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein settle their difference in a duel. He reasoned this would not only serve as an alternative to a war that was certain to damage Iraq&#x27;s infrastructure, but that it would also reduce the suffering of the Iraqi and American peoples. Ramadan&#x27;s offer included the possibility that a group of US officials would face off with a group of Iraqi officials of same or similar rank (President v. President, Vice President v. Vice President, etc.). Ramadan proposed that the duel be held in a neutral land, with each party using the same weapons, and with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presiding as the supervisor. On behalf of President Bush, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer declined the offer.

<text>is a 1958 Japanese &quot;jidaigeki&quot; adventure film directed by Akira Kurosawa, with special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya. It tells the story of two peasants who agree to escort a man and a woman across enemy lines in return for gold without knowing that he is a general and the woman is a princess. The film stars Toshiro Mifune as General Makabe Rokurōta and Misa Uehara as Princess Yuki while the peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are portrayed by Minoru Chiaki and Kamatari Fujiwara respectively.

&quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; was the fourth highest-grossing film of the year in Japan, and Kurosawa&#x27;s most successful film up to that point. It was a significant influence on the 1977 American film &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

==Plot==
Two bedraggled peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, sell their homes and leave to enlist with the feudal Yamana clan, hoping to make their fortunes as soldiers. Instead, they are mistaken for soldiers of the defeated Akizuki clan, have their weapons confiscated, and are forced to help dig graves before being sent away without any food. After quarrelling and splitting up, the two are each captured again and reunited when the Yamana force them alongside dozens of other prisoners to dig through the ruins of the Akizuki castle for the clan&#x27;s secret reserve of gold. After a prisoner uprising, Tahei and Matashichi slip away, steal some rice, and make camp near a river.

While building a fire, they find a piece of gold marked with the crescent of the Akizuki clan hidden in a hollowed-out stick. Looking for more of the gold, the peasants are discovered by a mysterious man whom they take to be a bandit. They explain how they intend to escape Yamana territory: rather than cross the closely-guarded border into the neighboring state of Hayakawa, they will travel to Yamana itself and then pass into Hayakawa. The stranger is enthused by their plan, so he shows them another piece of gold, and he leads them to a secret camp in the mountains where the rest is hidden. Unbeknownst to them, the man is a famous Akizuki general, Makabe Rokurōta. Although Rokurōta initially planned to kill the peasants, he changes his mind and decides to use their plan to bring the gold and Princess Yuki of the Akizuki clan, also hidden in the camp, to Hayakawa, whose lord has promised to protect them.

Rokurōta escorts Princess Yuki and the huge cache, 200 kan of the clan&#x27;s gold (still hidden in hollowed-out logs of wood), to Yamana, bringing Matashichi and Tahei to help carry the gold but kept unaware of Yuki and Rokurōta&#x27;s identities. To protect Yuki, he has her pretend to be a deaf-mute and has a decoy (Rokurōta&#x27;s younger sister) sent to the Yamana to be executed so they will believe that she is dead. During their travels, Tahei and Matashichi get the group into dangerous situations several times owing to their cowardice and greed. During a stop for the night at an inn, Yuki forces Rokurōta to buy the freedom of a captive young woman who had belonged to the Akizuki clan, who then refuses to leave them.

After losing their horses and obtaining a cart to move the gold, the group is spotted by a Yamana patrol, and Rokurōta is forced to kill them. While pursuing two stragglers, he accidentally rides into a Yamana camp, where the commanding officer, Rokurōta&#x27;s old rival Hyoe Tadokoro, recognizes him. Tadokoro is sorry he didn&#x27;t get to face Rokurōta in battle and challenges him to a lance duel. Rokurōta wins, but spares Tadokoro&#x27;s life before stealing a horse and riding back to the group. While in Yamana, they see worshippers gathering for the Fire Festival, so Tahei and Matashichi decide to hide the load of wood among them, but, since they are under the eyes of the Yamana soldiers, they are forced to throw the cart onto the bonfire and join in the ritual dance. Princess Yuki is quite taken by the philosophy behind the Festival regarding the shortness of life and the pettiness of the world. The next day they dig the gold out of the fire&#x27;s remains and take away as much as they can carry. One night as they approach the Hayakawa border, they are surrounded. Matashichi and Tahei manage to hide in the confusion while the rest are captured by Yamana soldiers and detained at an outpost. The two of them try to turn in Rokurōta for a reward, but having already captured them, the soldiers laugh at them and they leave for Hayakawa with nothing.

Tadokoro comes to identify the prisoners the night before their execution. Tadokoro&#x27;s face is now disfigured by a large scar which he explains is the result of a beating ordered by the Yamana lord, as punishment for letting Rokurōta escape. Yuki proclaims that she has no fear of death and thanks Rokurōta for letting her see humanity&#x27;s ugliness and beauty from a new perspective, and she repeats the ritual chant from the Fire Festival. The next day, as the soldiers start marching the prisoners to be executed, Tadokoro begins singing the same chant, and suddenly sends the horses carrying the gold running across the border. He frees the prisoners and distracts the guards so they can ride off, but Yuki tells him to join them. The entire group manages to escape across the border into Hayakawa.

Matashichi and Tahei, both hungry and tired, stumble across the lost gold carried by the horses and immediately start arguing about dividing it between them, before being arrested by Hayakawa soldiers as thieves. The peasants are brought before an armoured samurai and a well-dressed noblewoman. General Rokurōta and Princess Yuki finally reveal their identities to the astonished peasants. Thanking them for saving the gold (which will be used to restore her clan), the princess rewards Matashichi and Tahei with a single ryō on the condition that they share it. As the two men leave the castle to walk back to their village, they begin to laugh upon realizing that they have finally made their fortunes.

==Production==
&quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; was Kurosawa&#x27;s first feature filmed in a widescreen format, Tohoscope, which he continued to use for the next decade. The film was originally presented with Perspecta directional sound, which was re-created for the Criterion Blu-ray release.

Key parts of the film were shot in Hōrai Valley in Hyōgo and on the slopes of Mt. Fuji, where bad weather from the record-breaking Kanagawa typhoon delayed the production. Toho&#x27;s frustration with Kurosawa&#x27;s slow pace of shooting led to the director forming his own production company the following year, though he continued to distribute through Toho.

== Music ==

The film&#x27;s musical score was composed by Masaru Sato. The soundtrack album comprises 65 tracks.

==Release==
&quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on December 28, 1958. The film was the highest-grossing film for Toho in 1958, ranking as the fourth highest-grossing film overall in Japan that year. In box-office terms, &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; was Kurosawa&#x27;s most successful film, until the 1961 release of &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

The film was released theatrically in the United States by Toho International Col. with English subtitles. It was screened in San Francisco in November 1959 and received a wider release on October 6, 1960, with a 126-minute running time. The film was re-issued in the United States in 1962 with a 90-minute running time. The film was compared unfavorably to &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950) and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), and performed poorly at the U.S. box office.

==Critical reception==
In a 1957 review, &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a long, interesting, humour-laden picture in medieval Japan&quot;. Performances of the lead actors, Kurosawa&#x27;s direction and Ichio Yamazaki&#x27;s camerawork were praised.

An article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on January 24, 1962, featured a review of the film by journalist Bosley Crowther, who called &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; a superficial film. He said that Kurosawa, &quot;the Japanese director whose cinema skills have been impressed upon us in many pictures, beginning with &quot;Rashomon&quot;, is obviously not above pulling a little wool over his audiences&#x27; eyes — a little stooping to Hollywoodisms — in order to make a lively film.&quot; Crowther further opined that &quot;Kurosawa, for all his talent, is as prone to pot boiling as anyone else.&quot;

Writing for The Criterion Collection in 1987, David Ehrenstein called it &quot;one of the greatest action-adventure films ever made&quot; and a &quot;fast-paced, witty and visually stunning&quot; samurai film. According to Ehrenstein:
The battle on the steps in Chapter 2 (anticipating the climax of &quot;Ran&quot;) is as visually overwhelming as any of the similar scenes in Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot;. The use of composition in depth in the fortress scene in Chapter 4 is likewise as arresting as the best of Eisenstein or David Lean. Toshiro Mifune&#x27;s muscular demonstrations of heroic derring-do in the horse-charge scene (Chapter 11) and the scrupulously choreographed spear duel that follows it (Chapter 12) is in the finest tradition of Douglas Fairbanks. Overall, there’s a sense of sheer &quot;movieness&quot; to &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; that places it plainly in the ranks of such grand adventure entertainments as &quot;Gunga Din&quot;, &quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot;, and Fritz Lang&#x27;s celebrated diptych &quot;The Tiger of Eschnapur&quot; and &quot;The Hindu Tomb&quot;.

David Parkinson of the &quot;Empire&quot; on a review posted on January 1, 2000, gave the film four out of five stars and wrote &quot;Somewhat overshadowed by the likes of &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, this is a vigorously placed, meticulously staged adventure. It&#x27;s not top drawer, but still ranks among the best of Kurosawa&#x27;s minor masterpieces.&quot;

Writing for The Criterion Collection in 2001, Armond White said &quot;&quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; holds a place in cinema history comparable to John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot;: It lays out the plot and characters of an on-the-road epic of self-discovery and heroic action. In a now-familiar fashion, Rokurōta and Princess Yuki fight their way to allied territory, accompanied by a scheming, greedy comic duo who get surprised by their own good fortune. Kurosawa always balances valor and greed, seriousness and humor, while depicting the misfortunes of war.&quot;

Upon the film&#x27;s UK re-release in 2002, Jamie Russell, reviewing the film for the BBC, said it &quot;effortlessly intertwines action, drama, and comedy&quot;, calling it &quot;both cracking entertainment and a wonderful piece of cinema.&quot;

Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; made a review on February 1, 2002. According to him:Revered now as an inspiration for George Lucas, Kurosawa&#x27;s amiable, forthright epic romance happens on a scorched, rugged landscape which looks quite a lot like an alien planet. At other times, the movie plays like nothing so much as a roistering comedy western. But it has a cleverly contrived relationship between the principals, including a fantastically brash and virile Toshiro Mifune. The comedy co-exists with a dark view of life&#x27;s brevity, and Kurosawa devises exhilarating setpieces and captivating images. Arthouse classics aren&#x27;t usually as welcoming and entertaining as this.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 51 critic reviews, with the consensus, &quot;A feudal adventure told from an eccentric perspective, &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; is among Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s most purely enjoyable epics.&quot;

==Awards==
The film won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 9th Berlin International Film Festival in 1959. &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; awarded Shinobu Hashimoto the award for Best Screenwriter for his work on the film and for Tadashi Imai&#x27;s &quot;Night Drum&quot; and Yoshitaro Nomura&#x27;s &quot;Harikomi&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Influence===
American director George Lucas has acknowledged the heavy influence of &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; on his 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot;, particularly in the technique of telling the story from the perspective of the film&#x27;s lowliest characters, C-3PO and R2-D2. Some of the major characters from &quot;Star Wars&quot; have clear analogues in &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;, including C-3PO and R2-D2 being based on Tahei and Matashichi, and Princess Leia on Princess Yuki. Lucas&#x27;s original plot outline for &quot;Star Wars&quot; bore an even greater resemblance to the plot of &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;; this draft would subsequently be reused as the basis for &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. The movie is referenced in &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot;, where during a cutscene for the first level of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, there is a flag written in Aurebesh, which translates to &quot;Hidden Fortress&quot;.

A number of plot elements from &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; are used in the 2006 video game &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;.

===Remake===
A loose remake entitled &quot;Hidden Fortress: The Last Princess&quot; was directed by Shinji Higuchi and released on May 10, 2008.

<text>Arcangela Felice Assunta &quot;Lina&quot; Wertmüller (; 14 August 1928 – 9 December 2021) was an Italian film director and screenwriter. She is best known for her 1970s art house films &quot;Seven Beauties&quot;,&quot;&quot; &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot;, &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot;, and &quot;Swept Away&quot;. 

Wertmüller was the first female director to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director. She won many awards, including an Academy Honorary Award, as well as a David di Donatello Career Achievement Award, and was nominated for many others, including a Golden Globe Award, two Academy Awards, and two Palme d&#x27;Or awards.

==Early life==
Wertmüller was born Arcangela Felice Assunta Wertmüller in Rome, Lazio, in 1928, to Federico, a lawyer from Palazzo San Gervasio, Basilicata, belonging to a devoutly Catholic family of distant Swiss descent, and to Maria Santamaria-Maurizio from Rome. Wertmüller depicted her childhood as a period of adventure, during which she was expelled from 15 different Catholic high schools. During this time, she was infatuated with comic books, and described them as especially influential on her in her youth, particularly Alex Raymond&#x27;s character Flash Gordon. Wertmüller characterized the framing of Raymond&#x27;s comics as &quot;rather cinematic, more cinematic than most films&quot;, an early indication of her inclination toward film. Wertmüller&#x27;s desire to work in the film and theater industries took hold at a young age, as early on in life she developed an appreciation for the works of the Russian playwrights Pietro Sharoff, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, and Konstantin Stanislavsky, drawing her into the world of performing arts. 

After graduating from Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D&#x27;Amico in 1951, Wertmüller produced avant-garde plays, traveling throughout Europe and working as a puppeteer, stage manager, set designer, publicist, and scriptwriter for radio and television. She joined Maria Signorelli&#x27;s troupe in 1951. These interests developed toward two general avenues; one being the musical comedy and the other being grave, contemporary Italian dramas like the works of Italian playwright and director Giorgio De Lullo, whose work she described as &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;politically conscious&quot;. It is these two approaches that Wertmüller stated were at the core of her creative self, and always would be.

==Film career==

=== 1960s ===
After her years spent touring with an avant-garde puppet group, Wertmüller began to pursue a career in film. In the early 1960s, Flora Carabella, a school friend, introduced Wertmüller to her husband, the actor Marcello Mastroianni, who in turn introduced her to the film director Federico Fellini, who became her mentor.

Although &quot;The Lizards&quot;, which was scored by Ennio Morricone, was critically well received, it did not garner the level of attention her later works did. Throughout the 1960s, Wertmüller produced a series of films that were well liked but that failed to garner international success. Of these, her first collaboration with Giancarlo Giannini occurred in 1966&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Rita the Mosquito&quot;. Darragh O&#x27;Donoghue wrote in &quot;Cineaste&quot; that generally &quot;her early films comprise a fairly straight pastiche of neorealism and early Fellini (&quot;The Lizards&quot;, 1963), an episodic comedy, two musicals, and a Spaghetti Western (&quot;The Belle Starr Story&quot;, 1968, directed under the pseudonym Nathan Wich), works where knowledge of generic predecessors was essential&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
The 1970s saw the release of virtually all of Wertmüller&#x27;s most influential and highly regarded films, many of which featured Giannini. According to Geoffrey Nowell-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Companion to Italian Cinema&quot;, 1972 &quot;marked the beginning of Wertmüller&#x27;s golden age&quot;. Beginning in 1972 with &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot;, and continuing until 1978 with &quot;Blood Feud&quot;, Wertmüller released seven films, many of which are considered masterpieces of Commedia all&#x27;italiana. It was during this time she saw critical and international success, gaining traction as a filmmaker outside of Italy and in the United States on a scale that many of her contemporaries were unable to attain. 

In 1975, the National Board of Review in the United States awarded &quot;Swept Away&quot; Top Foreign Film, and in 1976, Wertmüller became the first female director to be nominated for an Oscar, for &quot;Seven Beauties&quot;. This film, which again features Giannini in the lead role, pushes Wertmüller&#x27;s specific brand of tragic comedy to its limits, following a self-obsessed Casanova from a small Italian town who is sent to a German concentration camp. The film initially met with controversy due to Wertmüller&#x27;s frankness in her rendering of the apparatuses of genocide as well as her perceived macabre insensitivity toward its survivors, but since has been accepted as her masterwork.

Wertmüller then signed a contract with Warner Bros. to make four films. The first was her first English-language film, &quot;A Night Full of Rain&quot;, which was entered into the 28th Berlin International Film Festival in 1978. The film was not a success and Warner canceled the contract. Wertmüller also had creative differences with the studio and wanted more creative freedom. In the same year, Wertmüller had another unsuccessful film &quot;Blood Feud,&quot; a mafia thriller starring Giannini, Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren.

=== 1980s &amp; 1990s ===
Wertmüller&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;A Joke of Destiny&quot; was entered into the 14th Moscow International Film Festival in 1985 and &quot;Camorra (A Story of Streets, Women and Crime)&quot; was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival in 1986. In 1985, she received the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.

After this period of acclaim, Wertmüller began to fade from international prominence, though she continued to release films well into the 1980s and &#x27;90s. Some of these films were sponsored by American financiers and studios, but failed to have the breadth of reach that her 1970s films achieved. These films are less widely seen and were neglected or disparaged by most, but &quot;Summer Night&quot; (1986) and &quot;Ferdinando &amp; Carolina&quot; (1999) have since improved in reputation. &quot;Ciao, Professore&quot; (1992) is one of her few films of this period that was relatively well-received as the number 10 film in Italy that year.

== Later life ==

Wertmüller was married to Enrico Job (died 4 March 2008), an art designer who worked on several of her pictures. They are survived by their daughter Maria Zulima (born 17 January 1991) who was an actress is a few of Wertmüller&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Blue Collar Worker and the Hairdresser in a Whirl of Sex and Politics&quot; (1996), &quot;Ferdinando and Carolina&quot; (1999), &quot;Too Much Romance... It&#x27;s Time for Stuffed Peppers&quot; (2004) and &quot;Mannaggia alla Miseria!&quot; (2009).

In 2015, Wertmüller was the subject of a biographical film directed by Valerio Ruiz, &quot;Behind the White Glasses&quot;, in which she reflects on her life&#x27;s work. Wertmüller continued to work as a theater director, until her death at her home on 9 December 2021, at the age of 93.

==Style and themes==
Fellini&#x27;s influence is evident in much of Wertmüller&#x27;s work. They share empathy with the Italian working class, showing the realities of life for the politically neglected and economically downtrodden, with a tendency toward the preposterous. Wertmüller&#x27;s work also seems to exhibit adoration of Italy and its varied locales, beautifying elements of her film&#x27;s locations with cinematography that presents its subjects with a colorful extravagance that idealizes the distinctly Italian settings of her films. Her aesthetic borrows heavily from her background in theater, routinely using the camera to emphasize performance and the grandiose comedy of her characters’ near constant emotional frenzy. Much of her work uses formal film tactics to dramatize the misapplication and destructive qualities that political ideology can have on individuals, satirizing common conceptions of revolution and the political status quo in the process.

Narrative and cinematic reflexivity are also commonplace in Wertmüller&#x27;s films, as she rehashed and reconfigured signs and modes of presentation in a way that references her inspirations and her contemporaries. This is made clear through her disruption of traditional conceptions of virtually all political dogma and the irrationality of her characters, taking recognizable elements of society and film and critiquing them by doing away with narrative and/or character plausibility.

This is particularly evident in a film like &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot;. This positions Mimi (played by Giannini) as an impossibly inept and simple man who fully embodies the notion of Italian machismo, as he fumbles his way through a world that throws a variety of ideologies and economic positions at him, all of which he readily inhabits. Mimi is perpetually successful in his performance of these roles, despite the audience&#x27;s awareness of their inauthenticity that results from a diegetic acknowledgement of Mimi&#x27;s hapless ignorance. This element of critique in the film functions as one example of one of the most prevalent themes in Wertmüller&#x27;s work, a desire to deconstruct and subvert the institutions and social ideologies of a capitalist modernity. This socialist-inflected politicization of class and the institution are also extended to sexuality and gender. Most of her films deploy these elements in conjunction with her affection for the theatrical in such a way that creates a unique concoction that is undeniably within the generic confines of &quot;Commedia all’italiana&quot;. According to Peter Bondanella, &quot;Wertmüller&#x27;s work combined a concern with topical political issues and the conventions of traditional Italian grotesque comedy&quot;.

Wertmüller is known for her whimsically prolix movie titles. For instance, the full title of &quot;Swept Away&quot; is &quot;Swept away by an unusual destiny in the blue sea of August&quot;. These titles were invariably shortened for international release. She is entered in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for the longest film title. The previously mentioned &quot;Blood Feud&quot; has the full name of &quot;Un fatto di sangue nel comune di Siculiana fra due uomini per causa di una vedova. Si sospettano moventi politici. Amore-Morte-Shimmy. Lugano belle. Tarantelle. Tarallucci e vino&quot;, which totals 179 characters.

<text>Two-terminal components and electrical networks can be connected in series or parallel. The resulting electrical network will have two terminals, and itself can participate in a series or parallel topology. Whether a two-terminal &quot;object&quot; is an electrical component (e.g. a resistor) or an electrical network (e.g. resistors in series) is a matter of perspective. This article will use &quot;component&quot; to refer to a two-terminal &quot;object&quot; that participates in the series/parallel networks.

Components connected in series are connected along a single &quot;electrical path&quot;, and each component has the same electric current through it, equal to the current through the network. The voltage across the network is equal to the sum of the voltages across each component.

Components connected in parallel are connected along multiple paths, and each component has the same voltage across it, equal to the voltage across the network. The current through the network is equal to the sum of the currents through each component.

The two preceding statements are equivalent, except for exchanging the role of voltage and current.

A circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a series circuit; likewise, one connected completely in parallel is known as a parallel circuit. Many circuits can be analyzed as a combination of series and parallel circuits, along with other configurations.

In a series circuit, the current that flows through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the individual voltage drops across each component. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents flowing through each component.

Consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and a 12-volt automotive battery. If a wire joins the battery to one bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, then back to the battery in one continuous loop, the bulbs are said to be in series. If each bulb is wired to the battery in a separate loop, the bulbs are said to be in parallel. If the four light bulbs are connected in series, the same current flows through all of them and the voltage drop is 3 volts across each bulb, which may not be sufficient to make them glow. If the light bulbs are connected in parallel, the currents through the light bulbs combine to form the current in the battery, while the voltage drop is 12 volts across each bulb and they all glow.

In a series circuit, every device must function for the circuit to be complete. If one bulb burns out in a series circuit, the entire circuit is broken. In parallel circuits, each light bulb has its own circuit, so all but one light could be burned out, and the last one will still function.

==Series circuits==
Series circuits are sometimes referred to as current-coupled. The current in a series circuit goes through every component in the circuit. Therefore, all of the components in a series connection carry the same current.

A series circuit has only one path through which its current can flow. Opening or breaking a series circuit at any point causes the entire circuit to &quot;open&quot; or stop operating. For example, if even one of the light bulbs in an older-style string of Christmas tree lights burns out or is removed, the entire string becomes inoperable until the faulty bulb is replaced.

===Current===
formula_1

In a series circuit, the current is the same for all of the elements.

===Voltage===
In a series circuit, the voltage is the sum of the voltage drops of the individual components (resistance units).
formula_2

===Resistance units===
The total resistance of two or more resistors connected in series is equal to the sum of their individual resistances:
formula_3

Here, the subscript &quot;s&quot; in denotes &quot;series&quot;, and denotes resistance in a series.

==== Conductance ====
Electrical conductance presents a reciprocal quantity to resistance. Total conductance of a series circuits of pure resistances, therefore, can be calculated from the following expression:
formula_4

For a special case of two conductances in series, the total conductance is equal to:
formula_5

===Inductors===
Inductors follow the same law, in that the total inductance of non-coupled inductors in series is equal to the sum of their individual inductances:
formula_6

However, in some situations, it is difficult to prevent adjacent inductors from influencing each other as the magnetic field of one device couples with the windings of its neighbors. This influence is defined by the mutual inductance M. For example, if two inductors are in series, there are two possible equivalent inductances depending on how the magnetic fields of both inductors influence each other.

When there are more than two inductors, the mutual inductance between each of them and the way the coils influence each other complicates the calculation. For a larger number of coils the total combined inductance is given by the sum of all mutual inductances between the various coils including the mutual inductance of each given coil with itself, which is termed self-inductance or simply inductance. For three coils, there are six mutual inductances formula_7, formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10, formula_11 and formula_12. There are also the three self-inductances of the three coils: formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15.

Therefore
formula_16

By reciprocity, formula_17 = formula_18 so that the last two groups can be combined. The first three terms represent the sum of the self-inductances of the various coils. The formula is easily extended to any number of series coils with mutual coupling. The method can be used to find the self-inductance of large coils of wire of any cross-sectional shape by computing the sum of the mutual inductance of each turn of wire in the coil with every other turn since in such a coil all turns are in series.

===Capacitors===
Capacitors follow the same law using the reciprocals. The total capacitance of capacitors in series is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual capacitances:
formula_19

Equivalently using elastance (the reciprocal of capacitance), the total series elastance equals the sum of each capacitor&#x27;s elastance.

===Switches===
Two or more switches in series form a logical AND; the circuit only carries current if all switches are closed. See AND gate.

===Cells and batteries===
A battery is a collection of electrochemical cells. If the cells are connected in series, the voltage of the battery will be the sum of the cell voltages. For example, a 12 volt car battery contains six 2-volt cells connected in series. Some vehicles, such as trucks, have two 12 volt batteries in series to feed the 24-volt system.

==Parallel circuits==

If two or more components are connected in parallel, they have the same difference of potential (voltage) across their ends. The potential differences across the components are the same in magnitude, and they also have identical polarities. The same voltage is applied to all circuit components connected in parallel. The total current is the sum of the currents through the individual components, in accordance with Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law.

===Voltage===
In a parallel circuit, the voltage is the same for all elements.
formula_20

===Current===
The current in each individual resistor is found by Ohm&#x27;s law. Factoring out the voltage gives
formula_21

===Resistance units===
To find the total resistance of all components, add the reciprocals of the resistances formula_22 of each component and take the reciprocal of the sum. Total resistance will always be less than the value of the smallest resistance:
formula_23

For only two resistances, the unreciprocated expression is reasonably simple:
formula_24

This sometimes goes by the mnemonic &quot;product over sum&quot;.

For &quot;N&quot; equal resistances in parallel, the reciprocal sum expression simplifies to:
formula_25
and therefore to:
formula_26

To find the current in a component with resistance formula_22, use Ohm&#x27;s law again:
formula_28

The components divide the current according to their reciprocal resistances, so, in the case of two resistors,
formula_29

An old term for devices connected in parallel is &quot;multiple&quot;, such as multiple connections for arc lamps.

==== Conductance ====
Since electrical conductance formula_30 is reciprocal to resistance, the expression for total conductance of a parallel circuit of resistors is simply:
formula_31

The relations for total conductance and resistance stand in a complementary relationship: the expression for a series connection of resistances is the same as for parallel connection of conductances, and vice versa.

===Inductors===
Inductors follow the same law, in that the total inductance of non-coupled inductors in parallel is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual inductances:
formula_32

If the inductors are situated in each other&#x27;s magnetic fields, this approach is invalid due to mutual inductance. If the mutual inductance between two coils in parallel is , the equivalent inductor is:
formula_33

If formula_34
formula_35

The sign of formula_36 depends on how the magnetic fields influence each other. For two equal tightly coupled coils the total inductance is close to that of every single coil. If the polarity of one coil is reversed so that is negative, then the parallel inductance is nearly zero or the combination is almost non-inductive. It is assumed in the &quot;tightly coupled&quot; case is very nearly equal to . However, if the inductances are not equal and the coils are tightly coupled there can be near short circuit conditions and high circulating currents for both positive and negative values of , which can cause problems.

More than three inductors become more complex and the mutual inductance of each inductor on each other inductor and their influence on each other must be considered. For three coils, there are three mutual inductances formula_7, formula_8 and formula_9. This is best handled by matrix methods and summing the terms of the inverse of the formula_40 matrix (3×3 in this case).

The pertinent equations are of the form:
formula_41

===Capacitors===
The total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is equal to the sum of their individual capacitances:
formula_42

The working voltage of a parallel combination of capacitors is always limited by the smallest working voltage of an individual capacitor.

===Switches===
Two or more switches in parallel form a logical OR; the circuit carries current if at least one switch is closed. See OR gate.

===Cells and batteries===
If the cells of a battery are connected in parallel, the battery voltage will be the same as the cell voltage, but the current supplied by each cell will be a fraction of the total current. For example, if a battery comprises four identical cells connected in parallel and delivers a current of 1 ampere, the current supplied by each cell will be 0.25 ampere. If the cells are not identical in voltage, cells with higher voltages will attempt to charge those with lower ones, potentially damaging them.

Parallel-connected batteries were widely used to power the valve filaments in portable radios. Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries (particularly laptop batteries) are often connected in parallel to increase the ampere-hour rating. Some solar electric systems have batteries in parallel to increase the storage capacity; a close approximation of total amp-hours is the sum of all amp-hours of in-parallel batteries.

==Combining conductances==
From Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws the rules for combining conductance can be deducted. For two conductances formula_43 and formula_44 in &quot;parallel&quot;, the voltage across them is the same and from Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law (KCL) the total current is
formula_45

Substituting Ohm&#x27;s law for conductances gives
formula_46
and the equivalent conductance will be,
formula_47

For two conductances formula_43 and formula_44 in series the current through them will be the same and Kirchhoff&#x27;s Voltage Law says that the voltage across them is the sum of the voltages across each conductance, that is,
formula_50

Substituting Ohm&#x27;s law for conductance then gives,
formula_51
which in turn gives the formula for the equivalent conductance,
formula_52

This equation can be rearranged slightly, though this is a special case that will only rearrange like this for two components.

formula_5
For three conductances in series,
formula_54

==Notation==
The value of two components in parallel is often represented in equations by the parallel operator, two vertical lines (∥), borrowing the parallel lines notation from geometry.
formula_55

This simplifies expressions that would otherwise become complicated by expansion of the terms. For instance:
formula_56

==Applications==
A common application of series circuit in consumer electronics is in batteries, where several cells connected in series are used to obtain a convenient operating voltage. Two disposable zinc cells in series might power a flashlight or remote control at 3 volts; the battery pack for a hand-held power tool might contain a dozen lithium-ion cells wired in series to provide 48 volts.

Series circuits were formerly used for lighting in electric multiple units trains. For example, if the supply voltage was 600 volts there might be eight 70-volt bulbs in series (total 560 volts) plus a resistor to drop the remaining 40 volts. Series circuits for train lighting were superseded, first by motor-generators, then by solid state devices.

Series resistance can also be applied to the arrangement of blood vessels within a given organ. Each organ is supplied by a large artery, smaller arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins arranged in series. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, as expressed by the following equation: . The largest proportion of resistance in this series is contributed by the arterioles.

Parallel resistance is illustrated by the circulatory system. Each organ is supplied by an artery that branches off the aorta. The total resistance of this parallel arrangement is expressed by the following equation: . , , and are the resistances of the renal, hepatic, and other arteries respectively. The total resistance is less than the resistance of any of the individual arteries.

<doc id="270780" wikidata="Q1227470" url="?curid=270780" title="Tolpuddle">
<text>Tolpuddle () is a village in the civil parish of Burleston and Tolpuddle, in Dorset, England, on the River Piddle from which it takes its name, east of Dorchester, the county town, and west of Poole. The estimated population of the parish in 2013 was 420.

The village is well known as the home of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, six men who were sentenced to be transported to Australia after they formed a friendly society in 1833. A row of cottages, housing agricultural workers and a museum, and a row of seated statues commemorate the martyrs. The annual Tolpuddle Martyrs festival is held in the village on the third weekend of July. An ancient sycamore tree on the village green, known as the Martyrs&#x27; Tree, is said to be the place where the Martyrs swore their oath. It is cared for by the National Trust.

The Martyrs Inn public house is owned by nearby Athelhampton House, a Tudor house open to the public approximately to the west.

St John the Evangelist&#x27;s Parish Church dates from the 13th century.

In 1999, the A35 trunk road through south Dorset, was moved to bypass both Tolpuddle and nearby Puddletown.
==Governance==
At the local government level, Tolpuddle is in the Puddletown Area parish council and the Dorset unitary authority area. For elections to Dorset Council is part of the Puddletown and Lower Winterborne electoral ward. On 1 April 2024 the parish was abolished and merged with Burleston to form &quot;Burleston and Tolpuddle&quot;.

Historically, Tolpuddle was in Puddletown Hundred. It was part of Dorchester Rural District from 1894 to 1974, and West Dorset district from 1974 to 2019.

In the UK national parliament, Tolpuddle is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency.

<text>An all-star game is an exhibition game that showcases the best players (the &quot;stars&quot;) of a sports league. The exhibition is between two teams organized solely for the event, usually representing the league&#x27;s teams based on region or division, but sometimes dividing the players by an attribute such as nationality. Selection of the players may be done by a vote of the coaches and/or news media; in professional leagues, fans may vote on some or all of the roster. An all-star game usually occurs at the midpoint of the regular season. An exception is American football&#x27;s NFL Pro Bowl, which occurs at the end of the season.

All-star games are usually organized like regular games, but are often played with less emphasis on victory. Competing goals are to give many players time in the game and to avoid injury. In ice hockey, for example, there is no serious checking, while in American football no blitzing is allowed. In basketball, there is virtually no defense played until the final quarter; instead, the Australian State of Origin series involves physicality that often leads to on-field scuffles. The results, particularly in later years, have been met with overwhelming negative reactions from fans and sports media, criticizing players for not trying, and causing the games to have among the lowest ratings in a sports league season.

The current format of the NHL All-Star Game differs significantly from that of normal league games. Instead of a single game, the event is organized as a four-team knockout tournament, with each team representing one of the league&#x27;s divisions. Additionally, each game within the event is contested as a single 20-minute period, making the playing time of the All-Star Game identical to that of a regulation NHL game. The most radical difference is the on-ice team composition—instead of five skaters and one goaltender at full strength, each team has three skaters and a goaltender. Due to the reduced team sizes, penalties that normally cause the penalized team to lose a skater instead give the non-penalized team an extra skater.

The term &quot;all-star&quot; is mainly used in North America. All-star games are rare in international sports, such as association football, where games between national teams are more popular than all-star games would be. In the United Kingdom, all-star teams are usually denoted with the Roman numeral corresponding to the number of players allowed on the field – for example, a soccer or cricket &quot;XI&quot;, a rugby league &quot;XIII&quot; and a rugby union &quot;XV&quot;.

Major League Baseball organized the first professional league all-star game as part of the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago. It was the brainchild of Arch Ward, then sports editor for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. Initially intended to be a one-time event, its great success resulted in playing the game annually. Ward&#x27;s contribution was recognized by Major League Baseball in 1962 with the creation of the Arch Ward Trophy, given to the All-Star Game&#x27;s most valuable player each year.

==Professional all-star games==

=== North America ===
==== Major leagues ====
* Major League Baseball All-Star Game (National League vs. American League)
* National Basketball Association All-Star Game
** The game has had two formats throughout its history:
*** The original format used from the first game in 1951 until 2017 pitted Eastern Conference and Western Conference all-star teams.
*** The 2018 to the 2023 All-Star games, followed a fantasy draft format, similar to the 2011–2015 format of the NHL All-Star Game (see below), involving the selection of players by a combination of fan, player, and media voting. The vote leaders for each conferences are then named as team captains for each all-star team, who then select players from the rest of the all-stars, regardless of the conference they play in.
The 2024 All-Star Game reverted to its original East vs. West format. 
* National Hockey League All-Star Game
** The game has had a number of formats throughout its history:
*** The original format, used from 1947 through 1968 with two exceptions, saw the previous season&#x27;s Stanley Cup champions take on an &quot;All-Star&quot; team made up of the First and Second NHL All-Star Teams plus other star players.
*** In 1951 and 1952, the competing teams were the First NHL All-Star Team, supplemented with stars from the league&#x27;s American franchises, and the Second NHL All-Star Team, supplemented with stars from Canadian franchises. 
*** Beginning in 1969 and continuing through 2009, with some exceptions, the format was geographic—most recently Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference.
*** For 1979 and 1987, a single team comprising the NHL&#x27;s best players faced the Soviet national ice hockey team in a two-game series.
*** From 1998 through 2002, the teams were divided by player nationality, with a &quot;North America&quot; team made up of Canadians and Americans and a &quot;World&quot; team drawn from the rest of the world.
*** In 2006, 2010 and 2014, the league did not hold an all-star game, instead releasing its players to play ice hockey at the Olympic Games. The league held an all-star game in addition to releasing its players for the Olympics in 1998 and 2002.
*** Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout cancelling the entire season, the All-Star Game was not held in 2005. In 2013, the league did not hold an all-star game as well, as it omitted from the schedule because of the shortened season caused by the player lockout.
*** From 2011 to 2015, a fantasy draft took place that involved the selection of 42 players—six in fan voting, and the other 36 by the league. The selected players then chose two of these individuals as team captains.
*** From 2016 onward, the &quot;All-Star Game&quot; consists of a mini-tournament where teams representing the league&#x27;s divisions compete against each other in abbreviated games lasting only 20 minutes (instead of the three 20-minute periods of normal NHL games).
* National Football League Pro Bowl
** From 1938 to 1942, the NFL held an all-star game with the winner of that year&#x27;s NFL Championship Game against an all-star team composed of players from the other teams (and, at least once, teams outside the NFL).
** From 1951 to 2013, the Pro Bowl followed an inter-conference format (Eastern vs. Western from 1951 to 1969 and American Football Conference vs. National Football Conference since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970). The AFC vs NFC format was restored in 2017.
** From 2014 to 2016 it followed a draft format, similar to the 2011–2015 format of the NHL All-Star Game (see above).
:&quot;Note:&quot; In professional American football, the term &quot;all-star game&quot; can also refer to the American Football League All-Star game, played from 1961 to 1969; or the College All-Star Game, played from 1934 to 1976.
* Major League Soccer All-Star Game
** The game has had several formats throughout its history:
*** Originally, the game pitted Eastern Conference and Western Conference all-star teams. This format was used for all games save one from 1996 through 2001, and also in 2004.
*** The 1998 game pitted an &quot;MLS USA&quot; team, consisting entirely of Americans, against an &quot;MLS World&quot; team drawn from all other nationalities.
*** The 2002 game matched an MLS all-star team against the US national team.
*** The 2003 game was the first in which an MLS all-star team played a visiting foreign club team. This format was used through the 2019 edition, with the exception of 2004. In the 2003 game, the visiting team was from Mexico; from 2005 to 2019, the visiting team was based in Europe.
*** The 2021 game was the first to incorporate its current format involving all-star teams from both MLS and Mexico&#x27;s top league, Liga MX.
* NASCAR All-Star Race (Race winners from previous and current season, as well as Cup champions and All-Star Race winners from the previous 10 seasons)
* WNBA All-Star Game (usually Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference)
** In 2004 and 2010, the East-West format was not followed; instead, the USA national team faced a team of WNBA all-stars. The league does not consider these games to be official All-Star Games.
** From 2008 forward, no All-Star Game has been played in any Olympic year.
** Since 2018, the All-Star Game has used a draft format similar to that used by the NHL in the 2011–2015 period. In the WNBA&#x27;s implementation, fan voting determines the two team captains (though in the first game under the current format, Maya Moore declined the captain&#x27;s role).

** In the three years of the league&#x27;s existence, two different formats were used.
*** The first game in 2009, which took place after the season, employed a format similar to that of recent MLS All-Star Games, with a team of WPS all-stars taking on a visiting foreign club team (specifically Umeå IK of Sweden).
*** The 2010 edition took place at midseason. Of the 36 players, 22 were selected through a voting process, and the other 14 were selected by the league. The top vote-getters among U.S. and international players, respectively Abby Wambach and Marta, were named captains. They picked their first 10 teammates from the remaining 20 All-Stars selected through the voting process, with the league then filling out each roster.
*** No All-Star Game was held in 2011, which turned out to be the league&#x27;s final season, because the season ran up against the Women&#x27;s World Cup.
** The successor to WPS, the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (2013–present), has never held an all-star game.

<text>Dorchester ( ) is the county town of Dorset, England. It is situated between Poole and Bridport on the A35 trunk route. A historic market town, Dorchester is on the banks of the River Frome to the south of the Dorset Downs and north of the South Dorset Ridgeway that separates the area from Weymouth, to the south. The civil parish includes the experimental community of Poundbury and the suburb of Fordington.

The area around the town was first settled in prehistoric times. The Romans established a garrison there after defeating the Durotriges tribe, calling the settlement that grew up nearby [[Durnovaria]]; they built an aqueduct to supply water and an amphitheatre on an ancient British earthwork. During the medieval period Dorchester became an important commercial and political centre. It was the site of the &quot;Bloody Assizes&quot; presided over by Judge Jeffreys after the Monmouth Rebellion, and later the trial of the Tolpuddle Martyrs. As well as having many listed buildings, a number of notable people have been associated with the town. It was for many years the home and inspiration of the author Thomas Hardy, whose novel &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; uses a fictionalised Dorchester as its setting.

In the 2021 census, the population of Dorchester was 21,366. It is a centre for employment, education, retail, leisure and healthcare for the surrounding area, with six industrial estates, the Dorset County Hospital, a weekly market, and a high school and further education college. The town has a football club and a rugby union club, several museums and the biannual Dorchester Festival.

==History==
===Prehistory and Romano-British===

Dorchester&#x27;s roots stem back to prehistoric times. The earliest settlements were about southwest of the modern town centre in the vicinity of Maiden Castle, a large Iron Age hill fort that was one of the most powerful settlements in pre-Roman Britain. Different tribes lived there from 4000 BC. The Durotriges were likely to have been there when the Romans arrived in Britain in 43 AD.

The Romans defeated the local tribes by 70 AD and established a garrison that became the town the Romans named Durnovaria, a Brythonic name incorporating &quot;durn&quot;, &quot;fist&quot;, loosely interpreted as &#x27;place with fist-sized pebbles&#x27;. It appears to have taken part of its name from the local Durotriges tribe who inhabited the area.

Durnovaria was recorded in the 4th-century Antonine Itinerary and became a market centre for the surrounding countryside, an important road junction and staging post, and subsequently one of the twin capitals of the Celtic Durotriges tribe.

The remains of the Roman walls that surrounded the town can still be seen. The majority have been replaced by pathways that form a square inside modern Dorchester known as &#x27;The Walks&#x27;. A small segment of the original wall remains near the Top &#x27;o Town roundabout.
Other Roman remains include part of the town walls and the foundations of a town house near the county hall. Modern building works within the walls have unearthed Roman finds; in 1936 a cache of 22,000 3rd-century Roman coins was discovered in South Street.

Other Roman finds include silver and copper coins known as &quot;Dorn pennies&quot;, a gold ring, a bronze figure of the Roman god Mercury and large areas of tessellated pavement.

The Dorset Museum contains many Roman artefacts. The Romans built an aqueduct to supply the town with water. It was rediscovered in 1900 as the remains of a channel cut into the chalk and contouring round the hills. The source is believed to be the River Frome at Notton, about upstream from Dorchester. Near the town centre is Maumbury Rings, an ancient British henge earthwork converted by the Romans for use as an amphitheatre, and to the north west is Poundbury Hill, another pre-Roman fortification.

Little evidence exists to suggest continued occupation after the withdrawal of the Roman administration from Britain. The name Durnovaria survived into Old Welsh as Caer Durnac and later as Durngueir, recorded by Asser in the 9th century.

The area remained in British hands until the mid-7th century and there was continuity of use of the Roman cemetery at nearby Poundbury. Dorchester has been suggested as the centre of a sub-kingdom of Dumnonia or other regional power base.

===Medieval===
One of the first raids of the Viking era may have taken place near Dorchester around 790. According to a chronicler, the King&#x27;s reeve assembled a few men and sped to meet them thinking that they were merchants from another country. When he arrived at their location, he admonished them and instructed that they should be brought to the royal town. The Vikings then slaughtered him and his men.

By 864, the area around Durnovaria was dominated by the Saxons who referred to themselves as &quot;Dorsaetas&quot;, &#x27;People of the Dor&#x27; – Durnovaria. The original local name would have been Dorn-gweir giving the Old English Dornwary. The town became known as Dornwaraceaster or Dornwaracester, combining the original name &quot;Dor/Dorn&quot; from the Latin and Celtic languages with &quot;cester&quot;, an Old English word for a Roman station. This name evolved over time to Dorncester/Dornceaster and Dorchester.

At the time of the Norman Conquest in 1066, Dorchester was not a place of great significance; the Normans did build a castle but it has not survived. A priory was also founded, in 1364, though this also has since disappeared. In the later medieval period the town prospered; it became a thriving commercial and political centre for south Dorset, with a textile trading and manufacturing industry which continued until the 17th century. In the time of Edward III (1312–1377), the town was governed by bailiffs and burgesses, with the number of burgesses increasing to fifteen by the reign of James I (1566–1625).
===Early modern===
:&quot;&quot;The town is populous, tho&#x27; not large, the streets broad, but the buildings old, and low; however, there is good company and a good deal of it; and a man that coveted a retreat in this world might as agreeably spend his time, and as well in Dorchester, as in any town I know in England&quot;.&quot; – Daniel Defoe, in his &quot;A tour thro&#x27; the whole island of Great Britain&quot; (1724–26).

In the 17th and 18th centuries Dorchester suffered several serious fires: in 1613, caused by a tallow chandler&#x27;s cauldron getting too hot and setting alight; in 1622, started by a maltster; in 1725, begun in a brewhouse; and in 1775, caused by a soap boiler. The 1613 fire was the most devastating, resulting in the destruction of 300 houses and two churches (All Saints and Holy Trinity).

Only a few of the town&#x27;s early buildings have survived to the present day, including Judge Jeffreys&#x27; lodgings and a Tudor almshouse. Among the replacement Georgian buildings are many, such as the Shire Hall, which are built in Portland stone. The municipal buildings, which incorporate the former corn exchange and the former town hall, were erected in 1848 on the site of an earlier town hall, which was built in 1791 and had a marketplace underneath.

In the 17th century the town was at the centre of Puritan emigration to America, and the local rector, John White, organised the settlement of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The first colonisation attempted was at Cape Ann, where fishermen who would rejoin the fishing fleet when the vessels returned the next year, tried to be self-sufficient. The land was unsuitable, the colony failed and was moved to what is now Salem. In 1628, the enterprise received a Royal Charter and the Massachusetts Bay Company was formed with three hundred colonists arriving in America that year and more the following year. For his efforts on behalf of Puritan dissenters, White has been called the unheralded founder of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. (Some observers have attributed the oversight to the fact that White, unlike John Winthrop, never went to America.)

In 1642, just before the English Civil War, Hugh Green, a Catholic chaplain was executed here. After his execution, Puritans played football with his head. The town was heavily defended against the Royalists in the civil war and Dorset was known as &quot;the southern capital of coat-turning&quot;, as the county gentry found it expedient to change allegiance and to swap the sides they supported on several occasions. In 1643, the town was attacked by 2,000 troops under Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon. Its defences proved inadequate and it quickly surrendered but was spared the plunder and punishment it might otherwise have received. It remained under Royalist control for some time, but was eventually recaptured by the Puritans.

In 1685 the Duke of Monmouth failed in his invasion attempt, the Monmouth Rebellion, and almost 300 of his men were condemned to death or transportation in the &quot;Bloody Assizes&quot; presided over by Judge Jeffreys in the Oak Room of the Antelope Hotel in Dorchester.

===Modern===

In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs founded the &quot;Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers&quot;. Trade unions were legal but because the members swore an oath of allegiance, they were arrested and tried in the Shire Hall. Beneath the courtroom are cells where the prisoners were held while awaiting trial. Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. Plans have since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site.
Dorchester remained a compact town within the boundaries of the old town walls until the latter part of the 19th century because all land immediately adjacent to the west, south and east was owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. The land composed the Manor of Fordington. The developments that had encroached onto it were Marabout Barracks, to the north of Bridport Road, in 1794, Dorchester Union Workhouse, to the north of Damer&#x27;s Road, in 1835, the Southampton and Dorchester Railway and its station east of Weymouth Avenue, in 1847, the Great Western Railway and its station to the south of Damer&#x27;s Road, in 1857, the waterworks, to the north of Bridport Road, in 1854, a cemetery, to the west of the new railway and east of Weymouth Avenue, in 1856, and a Dorset County Constabulary police station in 1860, west of the Southampton railway, east of Weymouth Avenue and north of Maumbury Rings.

The Duchy land was farmed under the open field system until 1874 when it was enclosed – or consolidated – into three large farms by the landowners and residents. The enclosures were followed by a series of key developments for the town: the enclosing of Poundbury hillfort for public enjoyment in 1876, the &#x27;Fair Field&#x27; (new site for the market, off Weymouth Avenue) in 1877, the Recreation Ground (also off Weymouth Avenue) opening in 1880, and the Eldridge Pope Brewery of 1881, adjacent to the railway line to Southampton. Salisbury Field was retained for public use in 1892 and land was purchased in 1895 for the formal Borough Gardens, between West Walks and Cornwall Road. The clock and bandstand were added in 1898.
A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of the Depot Barracks in 1881. The High West Street drill hall was created, by converting a private house, around the same time.

Land was developed for housing outside the walls including the Cornwall Estate, between the Borough Gardens and the Great Western Railway from 1876 and the Prince of Wales Estate from 1880. Land for the Victoria Park Estate was bought in 1896 and building began in 1897, Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee year. The lime trees in Queen&#x27;s Avenue were planted in February 1897.

Poundbury is the western extension of the town, constructed since 1993 according to urban village principles on Duchy of Cornwall land owned by Charles III. Being developed over 25 years in four phases, it will eventually have 2,500 dwellings and a population of about 6,000. Charles was involved with the development&#x27;s design.

Dorchester became Dorset&#x27;s first Official Transition Initiative in 2008 as part of the Transition Towns concept. Transition Town Dorchester is a community response to the challenges and opportunities of peak oil and climate change.
==Government==
Dorchester is represented by two tiers of government, Dorchester Town Council and Dorset Council, both of which are based within the town. Dorchester elects five councillors to Dorset Council from three wards (Dorchester East, Dorchester Poundbury and Dorchester West) There are four electoral wards for Dorchester Town Council (North, South, East and West). Historically, Dorchester was a municipal borough from 1836 to 1974, and then part of West Dorset district from its creation in 1974 to its abolition in 2019.

For elections to parliament, Dorchester is in the West Dorset constituency. Historically it was in the Dorchester constituency from 1295 to 1868, and then the South Dorset constituency until 1918.

The town&#x27;s coat of arms depicts the old castle that used to stand on the site of the former prison and its taken from the town seal, which pre-dates the Arms. On the town seal, the royal purple background represents Dorchester&#x27;s status as part of the monarch&#x27;s private estate, a position held since before the Domesday Book was published. The shield is divided into quarters, two depicting lions and two fleur-de-lis, copied from the shields of the troops from Dorset who took part in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. The fleur-de-lis have a scattered arrangement which shows that permission for the armorial bearings was given before 1405, after which date the rights were varied by King Henry VI. The inscription &#x27;Sigillum Bailivorum Dorcestre&#x27; translates as &#x27;Seal of the Bailiffs of Dorchester&#x27;. The mayor has a similar seal of office, but this has the inscription &quot;Dorcestriensis Sig: Maioris&quot;.

In 2011, Dorchester was one of more than 20 towns across the country to apply for city status to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, although in March 2012 it was revealed that Dorchester&#x27;s bid had been unsuccessful.
==Geography==
Dorchester town centre is sited about above sea-level on gently sloping ground beside the south bank of the River Frome. Measured directly, it is about north of Weymouth, SSE of Yeovil in Somerset, and west of Poole. The town&#x27;s built-up area extends south, west and southeast of the town centre; to the north and northeast growth is restricted by the floodplain and watermeadows of the river.

The land immediately south and west of the town is part of the Dorset National Landscape area. It is traversed by the South Dorset Ridgeway, part of the South West Coast Path. There are over five hundred ancient monuments along the chalk hills that form the ridgeway, including barrows, stone circles and hillforts; many archaeological finds from the area are on view at the Dorset Museum in Dorchester.

The geology of the town comprises bedrock formed in the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, overlain in places by more recent Quaternary drift deposits. The bedrock is chalk of various formations. The drift deposits comprise a cap of clay-with-flints on the western edge of the town around Poundbury, alluvium in the river&#x27;s floodplain, and several narrow ribbons of poorly stratified head deposits, found particularly around the town&#x27;s northeastern and southwestern boundaries but also elsewhere.

==Economy==
In 2012 there were 17,500 people working in Dorchester, 51% of whom were working full-time. 57% of jobs were in public administration, education and health, 18% were in professional and market services (including finance and ICT), 17% were in distribution, accommodation and food, 4% were in production and 2% in construction. The unemployment rate in July 2014 was 0.9% of residents aged 16–64.

Dorchester has six industrial estates: The Grove Trading Estate (7.1 ha or 18 acres), Poundbury Trading Estate (5 ha or 12 acres), Marabout Barracks (2 ha or 4.9 acres), Great Western Centre (1.4 ha or 3.5 acres), Railway Triangle (1.4 ha or 3.5 acres) and Casterbridge Industrial Estate (1.1 ha or 2.7 acres). The estates mostly house light industrial units, wholesalers and the service sector. Significant employers for residents in the town include AEA Technology, BAeSEMA Ltd, Dorset County Council, Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Goulds Ltd, Henry Ling Ltd, Kingston Maurward College, Tesco, and Winterbourne Hospital.

In 2008 the Dorchester BID, a business improvement district, was set up to promote the town and improve the trading environment for town centre businesses. Local traders were overwhelmingly in favour of the decision, with 84% voting in favour at the February 2008 ballot. The BID is funded by a levy on the businesses in the town. The BID lasts initially for five years, and between 2013 and 2018 the projects being undertaken include business support, security projects, town promotion, the provision of green spaces and making the town more visually attractive. In June 2018 the Dorchester BID was successful in being voted in for a second term.

The catchment population for major food retail outlets in Dorchester is 38,500 (2001 estimate) and extends eight miles west, north and east of the town, and two miles south. The Brewery Square redevelopment project now includes retail outlets, residential units, bars, restaurants, hotel and cultural facilities. The regeneration of Dorchester South railway station will make it the UK&#x27;s first solar powered railway station. The Charles Street development has had a first phase completed that includes a library, adult education centre and offices for Dorset Council. Proposals for the development have included 23 shops, an underground car park, hotel and affordable housing.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census Dorchester civil parish had 8,996 dwellings, 8,449 households and a population of 19,060, with 48.35% of residents being male and 51.65% being female. 17% of residents were under the age of 16 (compared to 18.9% for England as a whole), and 22.4% of residents were age 65 or older (compared to 16.4% for England as a whole).

==Culture==
===Writers===

Novelist and poet Thomas Hardy based the fictional town of Casterbridge on Dorchester, and his novel &quot;The Mayor of Casterbridge&quot; is set there. Hardy&#x27;s childhood home is to the east of the town, and his town house, Max Gate, is owned by the National Trust and open to the public. Hardy is buried in Westminster Abbey, but his heart was removed and buried in Stinsford.

William Barnes, the West Country dialect poet, was Rector of Winterborne Came, a hamlet near Dorchester, for 24 years until his death in 1886, and ran a school in the town. There is a statue of Hardy and one of Barnes in the town centre; Barnes outside St. Peter&#x27;s Church, and Hardy&#x27;s beside the Top o&#x27; Town crossroads.

John Cowper Powys&#x27;s novel &quot;Maiden Castle&quot; (1936) is set in Dorchester and Powys intended it to be &quot;a Rival of the &quot;Mayor of Casterbridge&quot;. Powys had lived in Dorchester as a child, between May 1880 and Christmas 1885, when his father was a curate there. Then, after returning from America in June 1934, he had lived at 38 High East Street, Dorchester, from October 1934 until July 1935, when he moved to Wales. The building is commemorated with a plaque erected by the Dorchester Heritage Committee, but giving the date of his residence as 1936.

===Arts and museums===

Dorchester Arts, based in a former school building, runs a seasonal programme of music, dance and theatre events, participatory arts projects for socially excluded groups and the biannual Dorchester Festival. Dorchester Arts is an Arts Council &#x27;National Portfolio organisation&#x27;. Dorchester Arts has been resident at the corn exchange since 2015.

Dorchester museums include the Roman Town House, the Dinosaur Museum, the Terracotta Warriors Museum, the Dorset Teddy Bear Museum, the Keep Military Museum, Dorset Museum, and the Tutankhamun Exhibition. All of these museums took part in the &quot;Museums at Night&quot; event in May 2011 in which museums across the UK opened after hours. The Shire Hall which contains the court where the Tolpuddle Martyrs were held and tried opened as a museum in 2018. The Durnovaria Silver Band is based in Fordington Methodist Church Hall.

British sculptor Elisabeth Frink lived and worked in Dorset at her Woolland studio from 1976 until her death in 1993. Examples of her work can be seen across Dorchester, from the Dorset Martyrs Memorial sculpture to the Frink Collection at the Dorset Museum. 

==Notable buildings==
Within Dorchester parish there are 293 structures that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including five that are listed Grade I and sixteen that are Grade II*. The Grade I structures are the Church of St George on Fordington High Street, the Church of St Peter on High West Street, Max Gate on Syward Road, the Roman town house on Northernhay, and Shire Hall on High West Street.

The Church of St George has a late-11th-century south door that has a Caen stone tympanum with a realistic carved representation of St George surrounded by soldiers, said to depict the miracle of his appearance at the Battle of Antioch. The south aisle and the north part of the porch date from the 12th century. The Church of St Peter mostly dates from 1420 to 1421, with a 12th-century south doorway reset into it. There are many notable monuments, including two 14th-century effigies and a 14th-century tomb chest. Thomas Hardy contributed to the addition of the vestry and chancel in 1856–7.

Max Gate was designed by Thomas Hardy in the Queen Anne style, and was his home until his death in 1928. It was built in 1885. The remains of the Roman house north of county hall date from the early 4th century, with later 4th-century enlargements. It has a hypocaust heating system and mosaic pavements. It is the only visible Roman town house in Britain. The current Shire Hall building was designed by Thomas Hardwick and built in Portland stone ashlar in 1797. It replaced a previous structure that had fallen into disrepair.

A tablet commemorates the sentencing of the Tolpuddle Martyrs here in 1834. The building housed the Crown Court until 1955; Thomas Hardy was a magistrate here and his experience provided inspiration for his writing. The building has changed little since the 19th century, and in 2014 planning permission was granted to transform it into a heritage centre and tourist attraction, to open in 2017.

==Education and healthcare==

Dorchester has thirteen first schools, three middle schools: St Osmund&#x27;s Church of England Middle School, St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Middle School, Puddletown and Dorchester Middle School and an upper school; The Thomas Hardye School which was founded in 1569 and endowed by Thomas Hardye, a merchant in 1579. A free school &quot;one of the most striking achievements of puritan Dorchester&quot; operated here in the 1600s. The Thomas Hardye School was expanded and reopened in 1888 and in February 2023 it had 2,103 pupils enrolled. The author Thomas Hardy, a distant relative, was a school governor here from 1909 until shortly before his death. The nineteen schools in the Dorchester area form the Dorchester Area Schools Partnership (DASP). There is also a private school, Sunninghill Prep School.

Kingston Maurward College is a land-based studies college on the outskirts of the town. It offers full-time and part-time courses, apprenticeships and university-level courses in a wide range of subjects including agriculture, horticulture, conservation, construction, countryside and wildlife management.

The town&#x27;s hospital is Dorset County Hospital on Williams Avenue. It offers a twenty-four-hour accident and emergency treatment with services being provided by Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

==Sport and leisure==
Dorchester Town F.C., the town&#x27;s football team currently play in the Southern League Premier Division. Harry Redknapp and former England players Graham Roberts and Martin Chivers represented &#x27;The Magpies&#x27; in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The club is based on Weymouth Avenue in the south of the town after moving from its old ground also on Weymouth Avenue. The club moved to the purpose-built 5,000 capacity Avenue Stadium on Duchy of Cornwall land in the early 1990s.

Dorchester Sports F.C. is an amateur Association football team who currently play in the Dorset Premier Football League. The club was founded in 2007 and ground share at Dorchester Town F.C.&#x27;s The Avenue Stadium. 

Dorchester RFC is an amateur rugby union team who currently play in the Dorset &amp; Wilts South 1 League. Dorchester Cricket Club play in the Dorset Premier League, being last crowned champions in 2009.

A leisure centre and swimming pool on Coburg Road replaced the Thomas Hardye School Leisure Centre in 2012, at a cost of more than £8 million.

In May 2009, a skatepark opened at the junction of Maumbury Road and Weymouth Avenue in Dorchester after 12 years of planning and construction.

==Transport==

The town has two railway stations: 
* Dorchester South is on the South West Main Line between , , and . Services are operated by South Western Railway. As part of the regeneration at the Brewery Site in the town centre, it will become the first solar-powered railway station in the UK. 
* Dorchester West, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, is on the Heart of Wessex Line, operated by Great Western Railway. It connects the town with Yeovil Pen Mill, Bath Spa, Bristol Temple Meads and .

The town is on the A35, a trunk road connecting to Poole in the east and Honiton in the west; the A37 road north to Yeovil; the A352 road north to Sherborne; and the A354 road south to Weymouth. Mowlem completed a bypass road to the south and west of the town in 1988, diverting through traffic away from the town centre. The A35 is often subject to severe traffic congestion due to it being one of the main routes towards the south-west.

Buses are operated by First Hampshire &amp; Dorset. Notable services include route 10, a frequent service to Weymouth via Upwey and route X51 to Bridport. Damory Coaches and South West Coaches also operate local and regional services. National Express and Megabus operate long-distance coach journeys stopping at Dorchester with destinations including London Victoria and Weymouth.

==Media==
Local radio stations serving Dorchester include Greatest Hits Radio Dorset, BBC Radio Solent, and community radio station Keep 106, which grew from the County Hospital&#x27;s hospital radio station. Local television news coverage is by &quot;BBC South Today&quot; in Southampton, &quot;ITV Meridian&quot; in Whiteley, &quot;BBC Spotlight&quot; in Plymouth and &quot;ITV West Country&quot; in Bristol.

* Bayeux in France since 1959, because the Dorset Regiment were the first soldiers to enter the town in 1944 as the Second World War came to an end.
* Lübbecke in Germany since 1973, initiated when the Durnovaria Silver Band met the Lübbecker Schützenmusik Corps in Bayeux in 1968, when that town was in the process of twinning with Lübbecke. 
* Holbæk in Denmark since 1992, resulting from a shared interest in community drama. Actors from each town have appeared in plays in the other community.

The town&#x27;s schools are twinned with schools in Europe, Africa and Asia. The Thomas Hardye School has partnerships with schools in Tanzania, Dehradun and Bayeux.

==Freedom of the Town==
Sir Frederick Treves received the Freedom of the Town of Dorchester in July 1902, and Thomas Hardy on 15 November 1910.

<text>The Major League Baseball All-Star Game, also known as the &quot;Midsummer Classic&quot;, is an annual professional baseball game sanctioned by Major League Baseball (MLB) and contested between the all-stars from the American League (AL) and National League (NL). Starting fielders are selected by fans, pitchers are selected by managers, and reserves are selected by players and managers.

The game is usually played on the second or third Tuesday in July, and is meant to mark the symbolic halfway point of the MLB season (though not the mathematical halfway point, which, for most seasons, falls within the previous calendar week). Both leagues share an &quot;All-Star break&quot;, with no regular-season games scheduled from the day before through two days after the All-Star Game, with the exception of a single Thursday night game starting in the 2018 season. Some additional events and festivities associated with the game take place each year close to and during this break in the regular season.

No official MLB All-Star Games were held in 1945 and 2020, and no official selection of players took place, due to World War II travel restrictions and the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Two All-Star Games were held each season from 1959 to 1962. The most recent All-Star Game was held on July 16, 2024, at Globe Life Field in Arlington, home of the AL&#x27;s Texas Rangers.

==History==
Baseball teams put on benefit games for the families of players who died unexpectedly. For example, the Addie Joss Benefit Game in raised $12,914 for the Joss family ($ in current dollar terms).

The first All-Star Game was held on July 6, , at Comiskey Park in Chicago as part of the 1933 World&#x27;s Fair, and was initiated by Arch Ward, then sports editor for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and supported by American League president Will Harridge, who lobbied baseball executives to create the event. Initially intended to be a one-time event, its success resulted in making the contest an annual one.

From to , two All-Star Games were held each season, in order to increase the money going to the players&#x27; pension fund. This practice ended after the owners agreed to give the players a larger share of the income from a single game.

According to the Baseball Database provided by Sean Lahman, a total of 2,010 individual players have been selected for an All-Star game between 1933 and 2024.

==Venues==
MLB chooses the venue for the All-Star Game. The criteria for venue selection are subjective; generally, cities with new ballparks and those who have not hosted the Game in many years – or evertend to get selected. Over time, this has resulted in certain cities being selected to host more often than others. Cleveland Stadium and the original Yankee Stadium have each hosted four All-Star Games, the most of any venue, and New York City has hosted more Games than any other city, having done so nine times in five different stadiums. At the same time, the New York Mets did not host for 48 seasons (1965–2012), while the Los Angeles Dodgers did not host for 42 years, (1980–2022). (They were scheduled to host the 2020 Major League Baseball All-Star Game before it was canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic.) The Tampa Bay Rays are currently the only club yet to host an All-Star Game, and 3 other teams have never hosted the All-Star Game at their current stadium: The New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park (but scheduled for 2026) and the Atlanta Braves at Truist Park (scheduled in 2021 before the game was moved; now scheduled for 2025). Three teams have won the World Series in the same year their stadium hosted the All-Star Game: the 1939 New York Yankees, the 1959 Los Angeles Dodgers, and the 1977 New York Yankees.

The venues traditionally alternated between the American and National Leagues every year, with an AL team hosting in an odd-numbered year and an NL club hosting in an even-numbered year. This tradition has been broken several times; the first time was in 1951, when the AL&#x27;s Detroit Tigers hosted the game as part of the city&#x27;s 250th birthday (corrected by the NL hosting the next two seasons). The second was when the two-game format from 1959 to 1962 resulted in the AL being one game ahead in turn. The NL hosted two consecutive games in 2006 and 2007 (Pittsburgh and San Francisco), and in 2021 and 2022 (in Denver and in Los Angeles). The NL also hosted four straight games from 2015 to 2018 (in Cincinnati, San Diego, Miami, and Washington). The AL hosted two consecutive games in 2023 and 2024 (in Seattle and in Arlington, Texas). 

During the first two decades of the Game&#x27;s history, there were two pairs of teams that shared ballparks. In Philadelphia, the AL&#x27;s Athletics and NL&#x27;s Phillies both played at Shibe Park, and in St. Louis, the AL&#x27;s Browns and NL&#x27;s Cardinals shared Sportsman&#x27;s Park. This led to some shorter-than-usual gaps between All-Star Games played at the same venue; Sportsman&#x27;s Park hosted the All-Star Game twice in eight years (the Cardinals hosted in 1940 and the Browns in 1948), while Shibe Park was the All-Star venue twice in nine years (the Athletics hosted in 1943 and the Phillies in 1952).

The &quot;home team&quot; has traditionally been the league in which the host franchise plays its games. The lone exception has been the 2016 Game in which the AL was the &quot;home&quot; team, despite its being played in Petco Park, home of the NL&#x27;s San Diego Padres. This was announced after the 2017 All-Star Game was awarded to Miami, marking a third straight game hosted at an NL venue. This was done because, from 2003 to 2016, the league who won the All-Star Game was given home field advantage in the World Series, and MLB did not want to allow the NL to have the last at-bat in an All-Star Game for three straight years. MLB ended this practice in 2017, and the All-Star Game reverted to having the host team&#x27;s league serve as the home team.

==All-star team rosters==

===Selection of managers and coaches===

Since 1934, the managers of the game are the managers of the previous year&#x27;s league pennant winners and World Series clubs.

The coaching staff for each team is selected by its manager. This honor is given to the manager, not the team, so it is possible that the All-Star manager could no longer be with the team with which he won. This happened in 2003, when Dusty Baker managed the National League team despite having moved from the National League champion San Francisco Giants to the Chicago Cubs. This has also included situations where the person is no longer actively managing a team. For the first All-Star Game, intended as a one-time event, Connie Mack and John McGraw were regarded as baseball&#x27;s venerable managers, and were asked to lead the American and National League teams, respectively. McGraw came out of retirement for that purpose. Dick Williams resigned after managing the Oakland Athletics to the 1973 World Series. In 1974, he became manager of the California Angels, whose uniform he wore for the game. Tony La Russa, who managed the World Series champion St. Louis Cardinals in 2011, and retired after the season, came back to manage the National League in 2012.

In 1979, Bob Lemon managed the American League team after having been fired by New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. Lemon led the Yankees to the 1981 World Series but did not make it to the &#x27;82 All-Star Game as manager after again being fired by Steinbrenner, so Billy Martin, skipper of the 1981 AL runner-up Oakland Athletics, led the All-Star squad.

There have been some exceptional cases where the usual rule was abandoned. After the 1964 season and the World Series, the managers, Johnny Keane of the St. Louis Cardinals and Yogi Berra of the New York Yankees, both left their teams and found new jobs in the other league : Keane was hired to manage the Yankees, and Berra became a player-coach with the New York Mets. The Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds had finished in a second-place tie in the NL; the Chicago White Sox had finished second in the AL. Cincinnati&#x27;s manager, Fred Hutchinson, had died in the off-season, so Gene Mauch of the Phillies and Al López of the White Sox were chosen to be the managers for the 1965 All-Star Game. The rule may have been abandoned again in 2020, as the manager of the 2019 American League champion Houston Astros, A. J. Hinch, was suspended for the 2020 season (and subsequently fired by the Astros) for his role in the Astros&#x27; scandal involving the usage of video to steal signs; however the game was canceled due to the CoViD-19 pandemic.

Because of the season-ending 1994–95 MLBPA strike where the season was abandoned without official league champions, the 1995 game featured the &quot;unofficial&quot; league champions, the managers of the clubs leading their respective leagues&#x27; won-loss records, Buck Showalter of the New York Yankees and Felipe Alou of the Montreal Expos for the All-Star Game.

===Selection of players===

The All-Star Game roster size for each league was 18 in 1933, 20 from 1934 to 1938, 25 from 1939 to 1981, 30 from 1982 to 2002, 32 from 2003 to 2008, 33 in 2009, and beginning in 2010, there have been 34 players on each league&#x27;s team roster.

One continuing controversy of the player selection process is the rule that each team has to have at least one representative on its league&#x27;s All-Star roster.

On April 29, 2010, MLB announced several rules changes for future All-Star games, effective with the 2010 edition.

* Rosters were expanded by one extra position player, to a total of 34.
* The designated hitter will be used in all games, even in National League ballparks. (This became moot when the NL adopted the DH in 2022.)
* Pitchers who start on the Sunday before the game break will be replaced on the roster, but will still be recognized as All-Stars.
* Each manager may designate a position player who will be eligible for game re-entry if the last position player is injured or ejected. This is in addition to a rule that allows a player to re-enter to replace an injured or ejected catcher.

The AL and NL All-Stars are selected through the following process:
* &quot;Fan voting&quot; (nine N.L. players; nine A.L. players): Baseball fans vote on the starting position players for the All-Star Game, with ballots formerly distributed at Major League Baseball games before mid-season and, as of 2015, exclusively on the Internet. Since 2022, fans can vote for the designated hitter on both leagues; prior to that, only the AL designated hitter can be voted in, while the NL designated hitter must be selected by the manager. Fan voting has been recently criticized because most of the starting players can come from teams that have large fan bases or passionate fan bases such as the Kansas City Royals and the Chicago Cubs.
* &quot;Player voting&quot; (16 players): Eight pitchers (five starters and three relievers) and one back-up player for each position are elected by the players, coaches, and managers. If the top vote-getter at a position has also been selected via fan voting, the second-place finisher in this category is selected.
* &quot;Manager selection&quot; (eight N.L. players; eight A.L. players): The manager of each league&#x27;s All-Star team in consultation with the other managers in his league and the Commissioner&#x27;s Office will fill his team&#x27;s roster up to 33 players. Prior to 2022, the NL manager had the power to select his team&#x27;s designated hitter; this is no longer applicable after the NL adopted the designated hitter and fans are allowed to vote for that league&#x27;s starting DH. At this point, it is ensured that every team is represented by at least one player.
* &quot;Final vote&quot; (one player): After the list of 33 players for each league is announced, fans vote for one additional player, chosen from a list of five players that is compiled by the manager of each league&#x27;s team and the Commissioner&#x27;s Office. This concluded in 2018.
* &quot;Replacements&quot;: After the roster is selected, the All-Star manager and the Commissioner&#x27;s Office will replace players who are injured, decline to participate, and pitchers who started on the Sunday before the game.

====All-Star uniforms====
Since the first game, American League players have worn their respective team uniforms rather than wearing uniforms made specifically for the game, while National League players waited until the second game to do this. In the first game, the National League All-Star Team wore gray uniforms with navy blue letters spelling &quot;NATIONAL LEAGUE&quot; across the front of the jersey with &quot;NL&quot; caps.

Game-specific uniforms are made every year, but are not worn for the game itself. Instead these uniforms were worn during batting practice and the Home Run Derby. From the 2021 to the 2024 games, Major League Baseball and Nike released new All-Star Game uniforms annually, and these uniforms would be worn by the players during the game. Starting with the 2025 game, however, MLB reverted to wearing team uniforms at the All-Star Game.

====All-Star caps====
Starting with the 2014 All-Star Game, players began to wear special All-Star Game caps. For the workout, batting practice and Home Run Derby contest, players started using one type of cap with colors corresponding the league. For the All-Star Game day, players started wearing a cap with the team&#x27;s logo on front and the All-Star Game logo on the right side.

===History of player selection methods===

In 1933 and 1934, the fans selected the 18 starters for game and the managers chose the rest of the teams players. From 1935 through 1944 and in 1946, the manager of each All-Star squad selected the entire team; in 1945, no MLB All-Star Game was held and no All-Stars were officially named.

In 1947, fans were given the opportunity to vote on the eight starting position players, but in 1957, fans of the Cincinnati Reds stuffed the ballot box (see below), and elected a Red to every position except first base. Commissioner Ford Frick stepped in and removed two Reds from the lineup. As a response to this unfairness, fan voting was discontinued; players, coaches, and managers were given the sole authority to elect starting position players, for the next dozen years.

Between the lack of fan input and over-exposure due to the double All-Star games in 1959–1962, interest in the game was thought to be waning. As part of the rise of the MLB Promotion Corporation&#x27;s attempts to modernize marketing of baseball, fan balloting for the starting eight was restored for the 1970 game.

Sometime in the 1960s, the distinction between left-fielder, center-fielder, and right-fielder was dropped, and it was provided that the top three vote-getters in the outfield category would start regardless of position. Oft-heard remarks prior to this time included ones such as &quot;If you had Clemente, you couldn&#x27;t have Aaron&quot;, and so on.

Rico Carty was the first player ever selected to an All-Star team as a write-in candidate by fans, in 1970, the first year that voting was given back to the fans. Steve Garvey was the second player ever selected to an All-Star team as a write-in candidate by fans, in 1974. He was later the Most Valuable Player of that game as well as the National League MVP for that year.

From 2002 to 2018, the final roster selection has been made by the public via the All-Star Final Vote.

Until 2003, reserves and pitchers were chosen by the manager. Player voting was re-introduced in 2003 after the managers were criticized for picking players from their own team over more deserving players from other teams. This was particularly evident in 2002, when National League manager Bob Brenly selected his own catcher, Damian Miller, over the more deserving Paul Lo Duca; while American League manager Joe Torre selected his own third baseman, Robin Ventura, over the Oakland Athletics&#x27; Gold Glove and Silver Slugger-winning third baseman Eric Chavez.

Before the 2009 game, Major League Baseball announced that an additional pitcher would be added to each roster, bringing the total for each league to 33 players. The following year, MLB announced that an extra position player would be added to each roster for the 2010 game and beyond, bringing the total to 34 for each league.

One continuing controversy of the player selection process is the rule that each team has to have at least one representative on its league&#x27;s All-Star roster. Supporters of the rule point out that this prevents the large-market teams from totally dominating the squad, and keeps fan and media interest in the game, as fans would not be interested in the game if their team did not have any players involved. Opponents of the rule contend that the purpose of the game is to spotlight Major League Baseball&#x27;s best players, and that some players from stronger teams are left off the roster in favor of possibly less deserving players from weaker teams.

Both these arguments were strengthened by the greater urgency of winning the game, due to the former rule that the winning league attains home field advantage in the World Series. A number of compromises were suggested in the sports/news media as measures to mitigate these selection issues, including limiting the number of representatives a particular team could have; or requiring only that a certain percentage of the 30 teams be represented; or expanding the size of the All-Star rosters.

The only exception is if a team trades its lone All-Star before the game; in this case, its league&#x27;s All-Star Game manager is not required to include another player from that team.

===Stuffing the ballot box===
In 1957, Cincinnati Reds fans stuffed the ballot box and elected seven Reds players to start in the All-Star Game: Johnny Temple (2B), Roy McMillan (SS), Don Hoak (3B), Ed Bailey (C), Frank Robinson (LF), Gus Bell (CF), and Wally Post (RF), and the only non-Red elected to start for the National League was St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Stan Musial. While the Reds were a good offensive team, most baseball observers agreed that they did not deserve seven starters in the All-Star Game. An investigation ordered by Commissioner Ford Frick showed that over half of the ballots cast came from Cincinnati, as the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; had printed up pre-marked ballots and distributed them with the Sunday newspaper to make it easy for Reds fans to vote often for their favorite stars. Commissioner Ford Frick appointed Willie Mays of the New York Giants and Hank Aaron of the Milwaukee Braves to substitute for Reds players Gus Bell and Wally Post, and took fan voting rights away in future games; Bell was kept as a reserve, while Post was injured and would have been unable to play in any event.

Managers, players, and coaches picked the entire team until 1969, when the vote for starters again returned to the fans. To prevent a repeat of this incident, from 1970 until the start of internet voting, each team has been given the same number of ballots to hand out. In 1998, that number was roughly 400,000 ballots.

The 1988 Game was surrounded by tacit accusations against Oakland Athletics fans of stuffing the ballot box in favor of catcher Terry Steinbach, whose qualifications as a starter were questioned by some sportswriters. Steinbach wound up being named the game&#x27;s Most Valuable Player, hitting a home run and a sacrifice fly to get both RBIs in a 2–1 win.

Since the dawn of the internet age, online voting has again led to ballot stuffing. In 1999, Chris Nandor, a Red Sox fan, utilized a simple computer program to vote for Nomar Garciaparra over 39,000 times. Upon discovery, MLB rejected the votes.

In 2015, Kansas City Royals fans were accused of stuffing the ballot box when eight of their players (Salvador Pérez, Lorenzo Cain, Mike Moustakas, Alcides Escobar, Eric Hosmer, Kendrys Morales, Alex Gordon, and Omar Infante) were leading the ballots at their respective positions before the final tally was taken. Had this result stood, the only non-Royal in the American League&#x27;s starting lineup would have been Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim player Mike Trout. This also would have been a record for the most players from one team starting in the All-Star game. However, after MLB cancelled 65 million votes deemed to be fraudulent, the final starting roster included only Salvador Pérez, Lorenzo Cain, Alcides Escobar, and Alex Gordon (Gordon would be replaced due to injury). The only other Royals to make the final lineup were Mike Moustakas, Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis; Moustakas as the winner of the AL All-Star Final Vote while Herrera and Davis, both pitchers, were chosen through either Player Ballots or by Royals and AL Manager, Ned Yost.

===Designated hitter===
In 1989, a designated hitter was allowed in the All-Star Game for the first time. Between 1989 and 2010, the designated hitter rule was applied based on the league in which the host team plays; it was used for games played in American League ballparks in each such instance, both teams used a designated hitter while in National League ballparks, managers have scheduled the pitcher to hit, though pinch hitters have almost always been used in practice. This allows a deserving nonstarter to make a plate appearance. In 2010, Major League Baseball announced the designated hitter rule would apply for every All-Star Game; while the 2010 game was already to have the DH, the 2011 game was the first played in a National League park with a DH.

==All-Star Game MVP Award==

The All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award is presented annually to the most outstanding player of each season&#x27;s All-Star Game. Presented each year beginning in 1962 (two games were held in 1962 and an award was presented for each game), the MVP award was originally called the &quot;Arch Ward Memorial Award&quot;, after the man who came up with the concept of the All-Star Game in 1933. In 1970, the name was changed to the &quot;Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy&quot; (two NL players were presented the award in 1975); however, the name change was reversed in 1985, so that the World Series Trophy (first awarded in 1967) could be renamed the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy. In 2002, the trophy itself retained its eponym, while the award itself was dedicated as &quot;The Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award&quot;, in honor of former Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams, who had died earlier that year.

==Tie games, rain delays, and home-field advantage in World Series==
The first tie in an All-Star Game occurred on July 31, 1961 at Fenway Park in Boston when the game was called at 1–1 after nine innings due to rain; the only other rain-shortened game was in 1952, but the National League defeated the American League, 3–2 in five innings.

The 2002 All-Star Game, held in Milwaukee, ended in controversy in the 11th inning when both teams ran out of substitute players available to pitch in relief. At that point, Commissioner Bud Selig (a Milwaukee native and former owner of the Brewers) declared that the game would end after 11 innings, and it ended in a 7–all tie. The crowd booed and threw beer bottles onto the field, and the media were highly critical of this unsatisfactory conclusion.

To provide additional incentive for victory, Major League Baseball reached an agreement with the players union to award home-field advantage for the World Series to the champion of the league that won the All-Star Game, for 2003 and 2004. The agreement was extended for both 2005 and 2006, and it remained in place until 2016. Since 2017, home-field advantage has been awarded to the World Series team having the better regular season record.

Previously, home-field advantage in the World Series alternated between the two leagues each year. The American League took advantage of the new rule in each of its first seven years: between 2003 and 2009, the American League won four Series and the National League won three. The National League champion benefited from this rule for the first time in 2010.

Even with this rule in effect, there was no guarantee that a repeat of the 2002 situation would not occur; to avoid future ties due to lack of available players, managers have been instructed to (and have voluntarily) hold back a few select position players and pitchers. This has resulted in some fan dissatisfaction and controversy when these players are never actually used in the game, such as Tim Wakefield in the 2009 All-Star Game. Such a move has resulted in calls to allow limited re-entry of players who have been replaced during the game (in addition to catchers, which is already allowed), thereby giving the freedom to use all the players on the roster without leaving teams with the situation where no players are available, as was the case in 2002. Since 2010, each league&#x27;s manager is allowed to designate one position player who can re-enter the game to replace an injured or ejected player at any position, in addition to the existing rule covering catchers.

A tie game could have also been deemed a &quot;suspended game&quot; in which case it would have ended tied if no make-up date was scheduled, but it would be extremely difficult to find such a make-up date in any event as Major League Baseball would have to postpone one or more days of the regular season and/or schedule the make-up date on a travel day during the postseason, the latter which would be unfair to teams involved in the upcoming series. Since 2012, there have been off days for all teams on the Wednesday and Thursday after the All-Star Game, and if necessary, the game could have been finished in the morning or afternoon on Wednesday/Thursday if the situation warranted it.

Furthermore, various writers have stated that home-field advantage in the World Series should be decided based on the regular season records of the participants, not on an exhibition game such as the All-Star Game played several months earlier. Some writers especially questioned the integrity of this rule after the 2014 All-Star Game, when St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright suggested that he intentionally gave Derek Jeter some easy pitches to hit in the New York Yankees&#x27; shortstop&#x27;s final All-Star appearance before he retired at the end of that season.

In 2019 and 2021, any All-Star games that ended up tied after regulation would have had each extra inning start with a runner placed on second base to begin each half inning (a rule later used in the regular season since 2020). However, both the 2019 and 2021 All-Star games were decided in regulation and the 2020 game was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making the rule moot.

Since 2022, any All-Star game ending in a tie after 9 regulation innings will result in teams battling in a best-of-three-round home run derby. Three players are chosen by managers to determine who will bat. Each player gets three swings. Whoever hits the most homers in the three rounds will win it; otherwise, teams play sudden-death triple-swing rounds until one team out-slugs the other. Under this rule, extra innings are abolished. The game would go into the record book as a tie, with a notation made as to which league won the swing-off (which would be recorded as such in the head to head record), with no winning nor losing pitcher. Furthermore, the MVP Award would be based on what happened in the nine-inning game, with the derby not being considered.

==Winning streaks, run totals, longest games==

Ninety-three All-Star Games have been played (including two games per year from 1959–1962), with the AL leading 47-44–2. The All-Star Game has seen several &quot;eras&quot; in which one league tended to dominate. From 1933 to 1949, the American League won 12 of the first 16. The National League dominated from 1950 to 1987, going 33–8–1. This included a stretch from 1963 to 1982 when it won 19 of 20, including 11 in a row from 1972 to 1982. Since 1988, the American League has dominated, going 27–7–1, including a 13-game unbeaten streak (12–0–1) from 1997 to 2009.

The AL has a 383–377 run advantage.

The longest All-Star Game, in terms of innings, lasted 15 innings, which has occurred twice: 1967 and 2008; the latter of which was the longest game, with a total time of four hours and 50 minutes.

==All-Star Game scheduling==
Except for 1983, the All-Star Game has been scheduled on a Tuesday in July since 1963. In that year, in order to observe the 50-year anniversary of the first All-Star Game, the game was held on a Wednesday night, July 6, fifty years to the day of the first such event (July 6, 1933), at the same venue, Chicago&#x27;s Comiskey Park.

There have been two All-Star Games scheduled on Tuesday that were subsequently moved during the season.

* In 1969, the game was rained out and moved to Wednesday afternoon, July 23 (making it the last afternoon game).
* In 1981, it was moved to Sunday, August 9, because of the MLB players&#x27; strike. This was the only game to be played on a weekend, and the most recent game not held in the month of July.

The game was played at night for the first time in 1942, at the Polo Grounds, located in New York City. Since 1970, every All-Star Game has been played under the lights, though when held at venues near enough to the west coast, the game starts in daylight in the late afternoon.

Twice, the MLB All-Star Game has been deferred because of travel restrictions. In 1945, severe wartime travel restrictions in effect led to the game scheduled to be played at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park being deferred to the next season. In 2020, severe pandemic restrictions for MLB teams, including prohibiting teams from playing outside their divisions, the game scheduled to be played at Los Angeles&#x27; Dodger Stadium was deferred to 2022.

There were two All-Star Games played each season from 1959 through 1962. The second game was added to raise money for the MLB players&#x27; pension funds, as well as other causes, but the experiment was later abandoned on the grounds that having two games watered down the appeal of the event.

In 1981, the game was moved from July to August, after the middle portion of the 1981 season, including the scheduled All-Star break, had been erased by the MLB players&#x27; strike. The game (in Cleveland) was moved from its original July date to August 9. The season would resume in a split season format, second-half regular-season play began the next afternoon with a game in Wrigley Field in Chicago.

The 2021 All-Star Game was held in Denver, home of the NL&#x27;s Colorado Rockies, as MLB moved the 2021 game from Atlanta in response to a recently-passed Georgia election law, stating &quot;Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.&quot;

==Other All-Star Game events==

In addition to the All-Star Game, several events are held in the same host city and also televised nationally. 

The Home Run Derby, a contest among home run hitters, has been held on the day before the All-Star Game since 1985. The most recent Home Run Derby Champion is Teoscar Hernández of the Los Angeles Dodgers, after defeating Bobby Witt Jr. of the Kansas City Royals at the 2024 Home Run Derby in Arlington, Texas. 

Since 1999, the All-Star Futures Game has been held during All-Star Week. The two teams, one consisting of young players from the United States and the other consisting of young players from all other nations, are usually chosen based on prospect status in the minor leagues.

Since 2001, the All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game pits teams with a mixture of former stars from the host team&#x27;s past, as well as celebrities from music, film, and television. This game is held during the day prior to the Home Run Derby. However, it is tape-delayed and broadcast after the Derby.

Since 2021, the Major League Baseball Draft has been held during the All-Star Break and in the host city of the All-Star Game. 

The HBCU Swingman Classic, open to players from 17 historically black colleges and universities in the United States, was introduced in 2023 as part of an MLB-MLBPA Youth Development Foundation initiative.

From 1982 through 1990, the Cracker Jack Old Timers Baseball Classic (which lost the Cracker Jack sponsorship after 1987) was held during the All-Star Break, although it was never officially associated with MLB for publicity reasons. Former Atlanta Braves Vice President Dick Cecil had the initial idea, presented a successful 15-minute pitch to Cracker Jack CEO Frank Forrestal of how this would be their chance to re-associate the brand with baseball, and enlisted the Association of Professional Baseball Players of America (APBPA) to help bring in retired players to participate. APBPA leader and former MLB player Chuck Stevens was instrumental in the latter part. The game was played at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., from 1982 through 1987 and at the brand new Pilot Field in Buffalo, New York, from 1988 through 1990. It garnered national coverage from the first year thanks to both then-three-year-old network ESPN airing it and the iconic home run that then-75-year-old Luke Appling hit off of Warren Spahn in the first inning – the latter being particularly notable because Appling only had 45 total home runs in his 20-year MLB career. The only player to appear in all nine of the games was Joe DiMaggio.

<doc id="270787" wikidata="Q336320" url="?curid=270787" title="Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel">
<text>Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel (28 June 155719 October 1595) was an English nobleman. He was canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970, as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. Howard lived mainly during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I; he was charged with being a Roman Catholic, quitting England without leave, and sharing in Jesuit plots. For this, he was sent to the Tower of London in 1585. Howard spent ten years in the Tower, until his death from dysentery.

==Early life==


Philip was born at Arundel House, in the Strand, London in 1557, during the upheaval of the English Reformation. He was the only son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk by his first wife Lady Mary FitzAlan, youngest daughter of Henry FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel and his first wife, Lady Katherine Grey. He was baptised by the Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of York Nicholas Heath at Whitehall Palace with the royal family in attendance, and was named after his co-godfather, King Philip II of Spain, husband of the ruling monarch, Mary I. The baby&#x27;s other godfather was his grandfather, the 12th Earl of Arundel. His godmother was his great-grandmother, Elizabeth Stafford, widow of the 3rd Duke, who held the child over a gold baptismal font which was kept in the Treasury and normally used only for the baptism of royal children.

Shortly after his birth, his mother became seriously ill, possibly from puerperal infection and died at Arundel House in August of that year. The illness that caused his mother&#x27;s death was common due to poor hygiene around childbirth. His home from the age of seven was a former Carthusian monastery. Being the eldest son and heir to the Duke of Norfolk, Philip was destined to become the future 5th Duke. From the moment of his birth, he bore the courtesy title of Earl of Surrey, a subsidiary title of the dukes of Norfolk.

In 1569 his father arranged the marriage of Philip to his step-sister Anne Dacre, daughter of Norfolk&#x27;s third wife, Elizabeth Leyburne, by the latter&#x27;s previous marriage. Since both children were only 12 years old at the time, the ceremony was repeated two years later, after both parties had attained the age of consent. Philip&#x27;s half-brothers Thomas and William, sons of their father by his second wife Margaret Audley, subsequently married Anne&#x27;s sisters Mary and Elizabeth respectively.

Philip&#x27;s father, a Roman Catholic with a Protestant education, was arrested in 1569 for being involved in intrigues against Queen Elizabeth I, mainly because of the Duke&#x27;s intention to marry Mary I Stewart, Queen of Scots. Although he was released in August 1570, a few months later he became involved in the Ridolfi plot to overthrow Elizabeth, install Mary on the English throne and restore Catholicism, and was arrested again in September 1571, when his participation in the plot was discovered. Norfolk was tried for high treason and sentenced to death in January 1572. He was executed in June of that same year, when Philip was almost fifteen years old. After his father&#x27;s death, Philip and his surviving half-siblings Thomas, Margaret and William were left in the care of their uncle, Henry Howard, who also took charge of their education. During that time, the Howard children lived with their uncle at Audley End, one of his family&#x27;s properties. Due to his father&#x27;s execution, Philip lost much of his paternal family&#x27;s estates and the title of Earl of Surrey, as the dukedom of Norfolk was forfeit. Although Howard did not manage to recover the dukedom, a few years later he and his younger half-siblings were able to recover part of the forfeited properties.

It was during this time that Philip was sent to study at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. While Howard was studying there, his wife came under the protection of Henry FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel, Philip&#x27;s maternal grandfather.

Philip graduated in 1574, aged 17. He began attending Elizabeth I&#x27;s court by the time he turned eighteen; notably, this was only a few years after his father had been executed for treason against the Queen. His life had been frivolous both at Cambridge and remained so at court, where he nevertheless became a favourite of the Queen, despite Philip&#x27;s troubled family past.

In July 1578, his maternal aunt Jane FitzAlan died without living descendants, as the only three children she had from her marriage to John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley all died during infancy. With the death of his aunt, Philip became the sole surviving descendant of his maternal grandfather, and was heir to the earldom of Arundel and its subsidiary titles, and all of FitzAlan&#x27;s extensive properties in Sussex, including Arundel Castle, the main residence of the FitzAlan family, which later became the principal home of Philip&#x27;s descendants. After his grandfather&#x27;s death in February 1580, Howard received the entire inheritance of his maternal family, and the Queen made him Earl of Arundel. Since then the Earldom of Arundel has remained in the hands of the main line of the Howard family, and with the restoration of the Dukedom of Norfolk in 1660, the title remains one of the subsidiary (courtesy) titles of the dukes.

Howard is variously numbered as 1st, 20th or 13th Earl of Arundel. This is due to forfeiture losses and subsequent recreations of the title. If taken in a continuous line from the creation of the Earldom in 1138 by King Stephen for William d&#x27;Aubigny (d. 1176), Philip&#x27;s direct ancestor, Howard would be the 20th Earl.

==Received again into Catholic Church and later imprisonment==

Howard was present at a debate in the Tower of London in 1581 between a group of Protestant theologians and the Catholic priests Edmund Campion and Ralph Sherwin. This led him to return to Arundel to think about reconciliation with the Catholic Church, despite the dangers that would entail.

Philip was originally baptised as a Catholic and although he received a Protestant education, a vein of Catholicism was never far below the surface, mostly due to the fact that his close relations had remained loyal to the Catholic Church during the Reformation. His maternal grandfather was a staunch Catholic and his father, who had also been educated as a Protestant but was a Catholic, was disgraced for having conspired against Queen Elizabeth with the intention of replacing her with Mary, Queen of Scots and thus restore Catholicism in England. His paternal grandfather, the Earl of Surrey, also fell out of favour and was executed by Henry VIII, partly because he was a Catholic.

In 1583, the Earl was suspected of complicity in the Throckmorton Plot. He prepared to escape to the Spanish Netherlands, but his plans were interrupted by a visit from Elizabeth at his house in London and she ordered that he confine himself there.

That same year, the Countess of Arundel, without her husband&#x27;s knowledge and in great fear of his displeasure, secretly returned to the illegal and underground Catholic Church in England. After much effort, she successfully regained her husband&#x27;s affection.

On 30 September 1584, the Earl was secretly received again into the Catholic Church by the Jesuit priest Father William Weston. At the same time, the Earl&#x27;s younger half-brother, Lord William Howard, was also received into Catholicism. Arundel, while still attending Elizabeth&#x27;s court, successfully hid his adherence to Catholicism for a time, before withdrawing to his home and attempting to focus on being a better husband and father. The next year, Howard acted against Father Weston&#x27;s cautions, by attempting to flee to mainland Europe in order to live openly as a Catholic with his wife and children.

His flight abroad was recommended, planned, and betrayed to Sir Francis Walsingham by a trusted servant, whom Father Philip Caraman identifies as the Earl&#x27;s chaplain, underground Catholic priest and &quot;agent provocateur&quot; Father Edward Grately. While many other recusants had been able to successfully flee England, the Earl of Arundel, through his kinship to the late Anne Boleyn, was a second cousin once removed of the Queen. He was widely considered by persecuted Catholics who were plotting regime change to be a possible heir presumptive to the English throne. The Earl&#x27;s ship was accordingly attacked and boarded by English pirates working for the Tudor Navy while setting sail from Littlehampton. The Earl, who was at first led to believe that the pirate captain only wanted to extort a ransom, was instead arrested and committed to the Tower of London on 25 April 1585.

He was charged before the Star Chamber with being a Catholic, quitting England without leave, sharing in Jesuit plots, and claiming the title Duke of Norfolk in defiance of his father&#x27;s attainder. On 17 May 1586, he was fined £10,000 and sentenced to imprisonment at the Queen&#x27;s pleasure. In July 1586 he was offered his freedom if he would carry the sword of state before the Queen to church; he refused. In 1588 he was accused of praying, together with other Catholics, for the victory of the Spanish Armada. He was tried for high treason on 14 April 1589 and was found guilty. He was immediately condemned to death and attainted, with all his titles and property declared forfeit to the Crown.

In a letter dated 1 May 1589 to Claudio Aquaviva, Father Henry Garnet recalled, &quot;When the sentence was pronounced and the crowd saw the Earl coming out of the hall with the axe-edge turned in towards him -- in the trial of nobles this is the sign that the prisoner has been condemned -- suddenly there was a great uproar that was carried miles along the river bank, some people demanding what had come of the Queen&#x27;s clemency that such a splendid and gallant gentleman should suffer condemnation, others passionately indignant that a man who had prayed to God should be executed for that alone. For among the accusations brought against him, the principal charge and the one on which the whole case turned, was this -- he had asked a certain priest to pray for the success of the Spanish fleet; whereas in fact, all his enemies could prove against him and all he had done was this, that he sought that prayers should be said every day and night in the Tower of London and in other prisons at that time, chiefly, when everyone was expecting a general massacre [of Catholics].&quot;

Queen Elizabeth did not sign his death warrant, but Howard was never told this. He was kept constantly in fear of execution, although comforted by the companionship of a dog, which served as a go-between by which Howard and other prisoners, most notably the priest Robert Southwell, could smuggle messages to each other. Although these two men never met, Howard&#x27;s dog helped them to deepen their friendship and exchange encouragement in each other&#x27;s plight. Philip Howard loved his pet, which is remembered along with him in a statue at Arundel Cathedral.

One day Howard scratched into a wall of his cell the words, still visible today: () (&quot;The more affliction [we endure] for Christ in this world, the more glory [we shall obtain] with Christ in the next&quot;) (cf. Romans, chapter 8). That same phrase is also found today on one of the steps of Howard&#x27;s shrine in Arundel.

Each day he spent several hours in prayer and meditation; he was noted for his patience in suffering and courtesy to unkind keepers.

Howard spent more than ten years in the Tower. Father Weston later recalled, &quot;While he was enduring these cruel sufferings an offer of liberation was made him in the Queen&#x27;s name, but on condition that he held a disputation with the so-called Archbishop of Canterbury. This he refused to do. He preferred to be afflicted in the company of God&#x27;s people than to possess the passing pleasures of temporal freedom. Indeed, he reckoned persecution a greater happiness than the frail and shallow satisfaction of worldly well-being.&quot;

==Death and burial==
During the autumn of 1595, while dying of dysentery, the Earl petitioned the Queen to be allowed to see his wife and his son, who had been born after his imprisonment. The Queen responded, &quot;If he will but once attend the Protestant Service, he shall not only see his wife and children, but be restored to his honours and estates with every mark of my royal favour&quot;. To this, Howard is said to have replied: &quot;Tell Her Majesty if my religion be the cause for which I suffer, sorry I am that I have but one life to lose&quot;. He remained in the Tower, never seeing his wife or son again, and died alone on Sunday 19 October 1595.

Father Weston later recalled, &quot;There were some who thought he was carried off by poison. I, however, made careful inquiries of a certain Catholic who had served him as a page at that time in the Tower, but I was never able to get any confirmation of this. As he lay dying he bequeathed to me the breviary which he used: but Father Garnet decided to keep it himself for posterity like some religious object. He did not dare to entrust it to me, for everything I had was likely to be seized at any moment, and he did not think it right to expose to such manifold risk a possession which, he declared, was more precious than gold.&quot;

According to Father Philip Caraman, Garnet also kept the breviary which Robert Southwell had used in the Tower of London. Both, however, were lost in a raid by priest hunters on Garnet&#x27;s London safe house.

Howard was buried beneath the floor of the church of St Peter ad Vincula, inside the walls of the Tower, where his father&#x27;s remains also lay. The Earl&#x27;s funeral and burial, according to Father Caraman, &quot;cost his frugal Sovereign two pounds.&quot;

The Countess of Arundel took a vow of chastity after being widowed, and never remarried. She spent her remaining days writing Christian poetry, attending mass, and making other religious observances. She had a passion for helping those in need, especially the sick.

In 1624, the dowager Countess and their son obtained permission from King James I to move Howard&#x27;s remains, first to the residence of the dowager Countess at West Horsley, Surrey, and finally to the Fitzalan Chapel at Arundel Castle in Sussex.

The Dowager Countess died of natural causes on 19 April 1630 at Shifnal Manor, Shropshire aged 73, and was buried next to her husband inside the Fitzalan Chapel.

Even though Howard had been attainted at his trial in 1589, in 1603, shortly after the accession of the Scottish king James VI and I to the English throne and thanks to the intercession of Philip&#x27;s uncle, the Earl of Northampton, Thomas Howard, Lord Maltravers, Arundel&#x27;s son, was able to regain royal favour. In 1604, Thomas recovered the earldom of Arundel and estates.

==Legacy==

Along with Our Lady of the Assumption, St. Philip Howard is co-patron of the Diocese of Arundel and Brighton. Arundel Cathedral, originally dedicated to St. Philip Neri, was commissioned by the 15th Duke of Norfolk in 1868. It was elevated to the status of a cathedral in 1965 and its dedication changed to Our Lady and Saint Philip Howard just after Pope Paul VI canonised the Earl as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales in October 1970. On 10 March 1971 in the presence of Monsignor Michael Bowen, then Coadjutor bishop of Arundel and Brighton, and the Chapter of Canons, Howard&#x27;s remains were moved from the Fitzalan Chapel to the new shrine erected in the cathedral, where the consecration ceremony was held. Since then, the shrine has become a place of pilgrimage.

While imprisoned, Howard spent much of his time writing and translating Catholic poetry and devotional literature. The manuscripts, according to Father Caraman, were routinely smuggled out of the Tower of London to be edited and corrected by Father William Weston, before in at least one case, being smuggled to the Spanish Netherlands for publication by exiled English recusant Richard Verstegan.

For example, the Earl made a Latin-Elizabethan English translation of &quot;An Epistle in the Person of Jesus Christ to the Faithful Soule&quot; by John Justus of Landsberg, which was posthumously published at Antwerp (1595, reprinted 1871). Howard&#x27;s verse translation of Marko Marulić&#x27;s poem &quot;Carmen de doctrina Domini nostri Iesu Christi pendentis in cruce&quot; (&quot;A Dialogue Betwixt a Christian and Christ Hanging on the Crosse&quot;), served in lieu of an introduction in the Antwerp edition. Howard&#x27;s poetry translation of Marulić was published again, with updated English orthography, in the March/April 2022 issue of the Traditionalist Catholic literary magazine, &quot;St. Austin Review&quot;.

Howard also authored three manuscript treatises &quot;On the Excellence and Utility of Virtue&quot;.

Further detailed research about the Earl&#x27;s life, as well as several of his works of Christian poetry, was collected by the poet Louise Imogen Guiney and published as part of her 1939 collection &quot;The Recusant Poets&quot;.

<doc id="270789" wikidata="Q5252816" url="?curid=270789" title="Confirmation holism">
<text>In philosophy of science, confirmation holism, also called epistemological holism, is the view that no individual statement can be confirmed or disconfirmed by an empirical test, but rather that only a set of statements (a whole theory) can be so. It is attributed to Willard Van Orman Quine who motivated his holism through extending Pierre Duhem&#x27;s problem of underdetermination in physical theory to all knowledge claims.

Duhem&#x27;s idea was, roughly, that no theory of any type can be tested in isolation but only when embedded in a background of other hypotheses, e.g. hypotheses about initial conditions. Quine thought that this background involved not only such hypotheses but also our whole web of belief, which, among other things, includes our mathematical and logical theories and our scientific theories. This last claim is sometimes known as the Duhem–Quine thesis.

A related claim made by Quine, though contested by some (see Adolf Grünbaum 1962), is that one can always protect one&#x27;s theory against refutation by attributing failure to some other part of our web of belief. In his own words, &quot;Any statement can be held true come what may, if we make drastic enough adjustments elsewhere in the system.&quot;

==Underdetermination in physical theory==

By 1845 astronomers found that the orbit of planet Uranus around the Sun departed from expectations. Not concluding that Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation was flawed, however, astronomers John Couch Adams as well as Urbain Le Verrier independently predicted a new planet, eventually known as Neptune, and even calculated its weight and orbit through Newton&#x27;s theory. And yet neither did this empirical success of Newton&#x27;s theory verify Newton&#x27;s theory.

Le Verrier soon reported that Mercury&#x27;s perihelion—the peak of its orbital ellipse nearest to the Sun—advanced each time Mercury completed an orbit, a phenomenon not predicted by Newton&#x27;s theory, which astrophysicists were so confident in that they predicted a new planet, named &quot;Vulcan&quot;, which a number of astronomers subsequently claimed to have seen. In 1905, however, Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity claimed that space and time are both relative, refuting the very framework of Newton&#x27;s theory that claimed that space and time were both absolute.

In 1915, Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity newly explained gravitation while precisely predicting Mercury&#x27;s orbit. In 1919, astrophysicist Arthur Eddington led an expedition to test Einstein&#x27;s prediction of the Sun&#x27;s mass reshaping spacetime in its vicinity. The Royal Society announced confirmation—accepted by physicists as the fall of Newton&#x27;s theory. Yet few theoretical physicists believe general relativity is a fundamentally accurate description of gravitation, and instead seek a theory of quantum gravity. 

==Total vs. partial holism==

Some scholars, like Quine, argue that if a prediction that a theory makes comes out true, then the corresponding piece of evidence confirms the whole theory and even the whole framework within which that theory is embedded. Some have questioned this radical or total form of confirmational holism. If total holism were true, they argue, that would lead to absurd consequences like the confirmation of arbitrary conjunctions. For example, if the general theory of relativity is confirmed by the perihelion of Mercury then, according to &quot;total&quot; holism, the conjunction of the general theory of relativity with the claim that the moon is made of cheese also gets confirmed. More controversially, the two conjuncts are meant to be confirmed in equal measure.

The critics of total holism do not deny that evidence may spread its support far and wide. Rather, they deny that it always spreads its support to the &quot;whole&quot; of any theory or theoretical framework that entails or probabilistically predicts the evidence. This view is known as partial holism. One early advocate of partial confirmational holism is Adolf Grünbaum (1962). Another is Ken Gemes (1993). The latter provides refinements to the hypothetico-deductive account of confirmation, arguing that a piece of evidence may be confirmationally relevant only to some content parts of a hypothesis. A third critic is Elliott Sober (2004). He considers likelihood comparisons and model selection ideas. More recently, and in a similar vein, Ioannis Votsis (2014) argues for an objectivist account of confirmation, according to which, monstrous hypotheses, i.e. roughly hypotheses that are put together in an &quot;ad hoc&quot; or arbitrary way, have internal barriers that prevent the spread of confirmation between their parts. Thus even though the conjunction of the general theory of relativity with the claim that the moon is made of cheese gets confirmed by the perihelion of Mercury since the latter is entailed by the conjunction, the confirmation does not spread to the conjunct that the moon is made of cheese. In other words, it is not always the case that support spreads to all the parts of a hypotheses, and even when it does, it is not always the case that it spreads to the different parts in equal measure.

<text>Anhedonia is a diverse array of deficits in hedonic function, including reduced motivation or ability to experience pleasure. While earlier definitions emphasized the inability to experience pleasure, anhedonia is currently used by researchers to refer to reduced motivation, reduced anticipatory pleasure (wanting), reduced consummatory pleasure (liking), and deficits in reinforcement learning. In the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&quot; (DSM-5), anhedonia is a component of depressive disorders, substance-related disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders, where it is defined by either a reduced ability to experience pleasure, or a diminished interest in engaging in previously pleasurable activities. While the &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision&quot; (ICD-10) does not explicitly mention anhedonia, the depressive symptom analogous to anhedonia as described in the DSM-5 is a loss of interest or pleasure.

==Definition==
While anhedonia was originally defined in 1896 by Théodule-Armand Ribot as the reduced ability to experience pleasure, it has been used to refer to deficits in multiple facets of reward. Reconceptualizations of anhedonia highlight the independence of &quot;wanting&quot; and &quot;liking&quot;. &quot;Wanting&quot; is a component of anticipatory positive affect, mediating both the motivation (i.e. incentive salience) to engage with reward, as well as the positive emotions associated with anticipating a reward. &quot;Liking&quot;, though, is associated with the pleasure derived from consuming a reward. The consciousness of reward-related processes has also been used to categorize reward in the context of anhedonia, as studies comparing implicit behavior versus explicit self-reports demonstrate a dissociation of the two. Learning has also been proposed as an independent facet of reward that may be impaired in conditions associated with anhedonia, but empirical evidence dissociating learning from either &quot;liking&quot; or &quot;wanting&quot; is lacking.

Anhedonia has also been used to refer to &quot;affective blunting&quot;, &quot;restricted range of affect&quot;, &quot;emotional numbing&quot;, and &quot;flat affect&quot;, particularly in the context of post-traumatic stress disorders. In PTSD patients, scales measuring these symptoms correlate strongly with scales that measure more traditional aspects of anhedonia, supporting this association.

==Causes==
Studies in clinical populations, healthy populations, and animal models have implicated a number of neurobiological substrates in anhedonia. Regions implicated in anhedonia include the prefrontal cortex as a whole, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the striatum, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neuroimaging studies in humans have reported that deficits in consummatory aspects of reward are associated with abnormalities in the ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, while deficits in anticipatory aspects of reward are related to abnormalities in hippocampal, dorsal ACC and prefrontal regions. These abnormalities are generally consistent with animal models, except for inconsistent findings with regard to the OFC. This inconsistency may be related to the difficulty in imaging the OFC due to its anatomical location, or the small number of studies performed on anhedonia; a number of studies have reported reduced activity in the OFC in schizophrenia and major depression, as well as a direct relationship between reduced activity and anhedonia.
Researchers theorize that anhedonia may result from the breakdown in the brain&#x27;s reward system, involving the neurotransmitter dopamine. Anhedonia can be characterised as &quot;impaired ability to pursue, experience and/or learn about pleasure, which is often, but not always accessible to conscious awareness&quot;.

The conditions of akinetic mutism and negative symptoms are closely related. In akinetic mutism, a stroke or other lesion to the anterior cingulate cortex causes reduction in movement (akinetic) and speech (mutism).

==Occurrence==
===Major depressive disorder===
Anhedonia occurs in roughly 70% of people with a major depressive disorder. It is a core symptom of major depressive disorder, so individuals experiencing this symptom can be diagnosed with depression, even in the absence of low/depressed mood. The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) describes a &quot;lack of interest or pleasure&quot;, but these can be difficult to discern given that people tend to become less interested in things that do not give them pleasure. The DSM criterion of weight loss is probably related, and many individuals with this symptom describe a lack of enjoyment of food. They can portray any of the non-psychotic symptoms and signs of depression.

===Schizophrenia===
Anhedonia is one of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Although five domains are usually used to classify negative symptoms, factor analysis of questionnaires yield two factors, with one including deficits in pleasure and motivation. People with schizophrenia retrospectively report experiencing fewer positive emotions than healthy individuals, but &quot;liking&quot; or consummatory pleasure is intact in people with schizophrenia, as they report experiencing the same degree of positive affect when presented with rewarding stimuli. Neuroimaging studies support this behavioral observation, as most studies report intact responses in the reward system (i.e. ventral striatum, VTA) to simple rewards. However, studies on monetary rewards sometimes report reduced responsiveness. More consistent reductions are observed with regard to emotional response during reward anticipation, which is reflected in a reduced responsiveness of both cortical and subcortical components of the reward system. Schizophrenia is associated with reduced positive prediction errors (a normal pattern of response to an unexpected reward), which a few studies have demonstrated to be correlated with negative symptoms. People with schizophrenia demonstrate impairment in reinforcement learnings tasks only when the task requires explicit learning, or is sufficiently complex. Implicit reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is relatively intact. These deficits may be related to dysfunction in the ACC, OFC and dlPFC leading to abnormal representation of reward and goals.

===Substance-related disorders===
Anhedonia is common in people who are dependent upon any one or more of a wide variety of drugs, including alcohol, opioids, cannabinoids, and nicotine. Although anhedonia becomes less severe over time, it is a significant predictor of relapse.

===Post-traumatic stress disorder===
While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with reduced motivation, part of the anticipatory &quot;wanting&quot;, it is also associated with elevated sensation seeking, and no deficits in physiological arousal, or self-reported pleasure to positive stimuli. PTSD is also associated with blunted affect, which may be due to the high comorbidity with depression.

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
Anhedonia occurs frequently in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, with rates between 7 and 45% being reported. Whether or not anhedonia is related to the high rates of depression in Parkinson&#x27;s disease is unknown.

===Bipolar depression===
Anhedonia is also reported to appear in people with bipolar depression.

===Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder===
Anhedonia may be associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Impairments of dopaminergic and serotonergic function in the brain of those with ADHD result in dysregulation of reward processing, which can lead to anhedonia.

==Sexual anhedonia==

Sexual anhedonia in males is also known as &quot;ejaculatory anhedonia&quot;. This condition means that a male will ejaculate with no accompanying sense of pleasure. The condition is most frequently found in males, but females can experience lack of pleasure when the body goes through the orgasm process, as well.

Sexual anhedonia may be caused by:
* Hyperprolactinaemia
* Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), also called inhibited sexual desire
* Low levels of the hormone testosterone 
* Spinal cord injury
* Multiple sclerosis
* Use of SSRI antidepressants or having used SSRI antidepressants in the past
* Use (or previous use) of antidopaminergic neuroleptics (anti-psychotics)
* Fatigue
* Physical illness

A neurological examination and blood tests are very unlikely to determine the cause of a specific case of sexual anhedonia.

Patients may be prescribed sustained-release bupropion to aid in treatment, which has been shown to relieve sexual dysfunction even in patients without depression.

==Social anhedonia==
===Definition===
Social anhedonia is defined as a disinterest in social contact and a lack of pleasure in social situations, and is characterized by social withdrawal. This characteristic typically manifests as an indifference to other people. In contrast to introversion, a nonpathological dimension of human personality, social anhedonia represents a deficit in the ability to experience pleasure. Additionally, social anhedonia differs from social anxiety in that social anhedonia is predominantly typified by diminished positive affect, while social anxiety is distinguished by both decreased positive affect and exaggerated negative affect.

This trait is currently seen as a central characteristic, as well as a predictor, of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. It is also widely linked to autism spectrum disorder.

===Signs and symptoms===
* Decreased ability to experience interpersonal pleasure
* Social withdrawal/isolation
* Decreased capacity for social contact and interaction
* Lack of close friends and intimate relationships, and decreased quality of those relationships
* Poor social adjustment
* Decreased positive affect
* Flat affect
* Depressed mood
* State-related anxiety

===Background and early clinical observation===
The term &quot;anhedonia&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;an-&quot;, &quot;without&quot; and &quot;hēdonē&quot;, &quot;pleasure&quot;. Interest in the nature of pleasure and its absence dates back to ancient Greek philosophers such as Epicurus. The symptoms of anhedonia were introduced to the realm of psychopathology in 1809 by John Haslam, who characterized a patient with schizophrenia as indifferent to &quot;those objects and pursuits which formerly proved sources of delight and instruction&quot;. The concept was formally coined by Théodule-Armand Ribot and later used by psychiatrists Paul Eugen Bleuler and Emil Kraepelin to describe a core symptom of schizophrenia. In particular, Sandor Rado postulated that schizotypes, or individuals with the schizophrenic phenotype, have two key genetic deficits, one related to the ability to feel pleasure (anhedonia) and one related to proprioception. In 1962, Meehl furthered Rado&#x27;s theory through the introduction of the concept of schizotaxia, a genetically driven neural integrative defect thought to give rise to the personality type of schizotypy. Loren and Jean Chapman further distinguished between two types of anhedonia: Physical anhedonia, or a deficit in the ability to experience physical pleasure, and social, or a deficit in the ability to experience interpersonal pleasure.

Recent research suggests that social anhedonia may represent a prodrome of psychotic disorders. First-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia show elevated levels of social anhedonia; higher baseline scores of social anhedonia are associated with later development of schizophrenia. These findings provide support for the conjecture that it represents a genetic risk marker for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

Additionally, elevated levels of social anhedonia in patients with schizophrenia have been linked to poorer social functioning. Socially anhedonic individuals perform worse on a number of neuropsychological tests than non-anhedonic participants, and show similar physiological abnormalities seen in patients with schizophrenia.

===Comorbidity===
Anhedonia is present in several forms of psychopathology and autism spectrum disorder.

====Depression====
Social anhedonia is observed in both depression and schizophrenia, but social anhedonia is a state related to the depressive episode and the other is a trait related to the personality construct associated with schizophrenia. These individuals both tend to score highly on self-report measures of social anhedonia. Blanchard, Horan, and Brown demonstrated that, although both the depression and the schizophrenia patient groups can look very similar in terms of social anhedonia cross-sectionally, over time as individuals with depression experience symptom remission, they show fewer signs of social anhedonia, while individuals with schizophrenia do not. Blanchard and colleagues (2011) found individuals with social anhedonia also had elevated rates of lifetime mood disorders including depression and dysthymia compared to controls.

====Social anxiety====
As mentioned above, social anxiety and social anhedonia differ in important ways. Social anhedonia and social anxiety, though, are also often comorbid. People with social anhedonia may display increased social anxiety and be at increased risk for social phobias and generalized anxiety disorder. The exact relationship between social anhedonia and social anxiety, and whether one potentiates the other, has yet to be determined. Individuals with social anhedonia may display increased stress reactivity, meaning that they feel more overwhelmed or helpless in response to a stressful event compared to control subjects who experience the same type of stressor. This dysfunctional stress reactivity may correlate with hedonic capacity, providing a potential explanation for the increased anxiety symptoms experienced in people with social anhedonia. In an attempt to separate out social anhedonia from social anxiety, the Revised Social Anhedonia Scale didn&#x27;t include items that potentially targeted social anxiety. However, more research must be conducted on the underlying mechanisms through which social anhedonia overlaps and interacts with social anxiety. The efforts of the &quot;social processes&quot; RDoC initiative will be crucial in differentiating between these components of social behavior that may underlie mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.

===Primary relevance in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders===
Social anhedonia is a core characteristic of schizotypy, which is defined as a continuum of personality traits that can range from normal to disordered and contributes to risk for psychosis and schizophrenia. Social anhedonia is a dimension of both negative and positive schizotypy. It involves social and interpersonal deficits, but is also associated with cognitive slippage and disorganized speech, both of which fall into the category of positive schizotypy. Not all people with schizophrenia display social anhedonia and likewise, people who have social anhedonia may never be diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder if they do not have the positive and cognitive symptoms that are most frequently associated with most schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.

Social anhedonia may be a valid predictor of future schizophrenia-spectrum disorders; young adults with social anhedonia perform in a similar direction to schizophrenia patients in tests of cognition and social behavior, showing potential predictive validity. Social anhedonia usually manifests in adolescence, possibly because of a combination of the occurrence of critical neuronal development and synaptic pruning of brain regions important for social behavior and environmental changes, when adolescents are in the process of becoming individuals and gaining more independence.

===Treatment===
No validated treatment for social anhedonia has been identified. Future research should focus on genetic and environmental risk factors to home in on specific brain regions and neurotransmitters that may be implicated in social anhedonia&#x27;s cause, and could be targeted with medication or behavioral treatments. Social support may also play a valuable role in the treatment of social anhedonia. Blanchard et al. found that a greater number of social supports, as well as a greater perceived social support network, were related to fewer schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms and to better general functioning within the social anhedonia group. So far, no medicine has been developed to specifically target anhedonia.

===Sex differences===
In the general population, males score higher than females on measures of social anhedonia. This sex difference is stable throughout time (from adolescence into adulthood) and is also seen in people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. These results may reflect a more broad pattern of interpersonal and social deficits seen in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. On average, males with schizophrenia are diagnosed at a younger age, have more severe symptoms, worse treatment prognosis, and a decrease in overall quality of life compared to females with the disorder. These results, coupled with the sex difference seen in social anhedonia, outline the necessity for research on genetic and hormonal characteristics that differ between males and females, and that may increase risk or resilience for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia.

===Assessing social anhedonia===
There are several self-report psychometric measures of schizotypy which each contain subscales related to social anhedonia:
* Revised Social Anhedonia Scale – Chapman Psychosis Proneness Scales
* No Close Friends Subscale – Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire
* Introverted Anhedonia Subscale – Oxford–Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences

===Genetic components===
L.J. and J.P. Chapman were the first to discuss the possibility that social anhedonia may stem from a genetic vulnerability. The disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (&quot;DISC1&quot;) gene has been consistently associated with risk for, and cause of, schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and other mental illnesses. More recently, DISC1 has been associated with social anhedonia within the general population. Tomppo identified a specific DISC1 allele that is associated with an increase in characteristics of social anhedonia. They also identified a &quot;DISC1&quot; allele associated with decreased characteristics of social anhedonia, that was found to be preferentially expressed in women. More research needs to be conducted, but social anhedonia may be an important intermediate phenotype (endophenotype) between genes associated with risk for schizophrenia and phenotype of the disorder.

===Neurobiological correlates===
Researchers studying the neurobiology of social anhedonia posit that this trait may be linked to dysfunction of reward-related systems in the brain. This circuitry is critical for the sensation of pleasure, the computation of reward benefits and costs, determination of the effort required to obtain a pleasant stimulus, deciding to obtain that stimulus, and increasing motivation to obtain the stimulus. In particular, the ventral striatum and areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsolateral (dl) PFC, are critically involved in the experience of pleasure and the hedonic perception of rewards. With regards to neurotransmitter systems, opioid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and endocannabinoid systems in the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and OFC mediate the hedonic perception of rewards. Activity in the PFC and ventral striatum have been found to be decreased in anhedonic individuals with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. However, schizophrenia may be less associated with decreased hedonic capacity and more with deficient reward appraisal.

==Specific musical anhedonia==
Recent studies have found people who do not have any issue processing musical tones or beat, yet receive no pleasure from listening to music. Specific musical anhedonia is distinct from melophobia, the fear of music.

<text>Freiberg is a former district in Saxony, Germany. It was bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the district of Mittlerer Erzgebirgskreis, the city of Chemnitz, the districts of Mittweida, Meißen and Weißeritzkreis, and by the Czech Republic.

== History ==
The district was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of Freiberg, Brand-Erbisdorf and Flöha. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Döbeln, Freiberg and Mittweida were merged into the new district Mittelsachsen.

== Geography ==
The district was located on the northern slopes of the Ore Mountains. The largest river of the region is the Freiberger Mulde, which rises on Czech territory and from there runs northwards.

<text>In philosophy of science and in epistemology, instrumentalism is a methodological view that ideas are useful instruments, and that the worth of an idea is based on how effective it is in explaining and predicting natural phenomena.
According to instrumentalists, a successful scientific theory reveals nothing known either true or false about nature&#x27;s unobservable objects, properties or processes. Scientific theory is merely a tool whereby humans predict &quot;observations&quot; in a particular domain of nature by formulating laws, which state or summarize regularities, while theories themselves do not reveal supposedly hidden aspects of nature that somehow &quot;explain&quot; these laws. Instrumentalism is a perspective originally introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1906.

Rejecting scientific realism&#x27;s ambitions to uncover metaphysical truth about nature, instrumentalism is usually categorized as an &quot;antirealism&quot;, although its mere lack of commitment to scientific theory&#x27;s realism can be termed &quot;nonrealism&quot;. Instrumentalism merely bypasses debate concerning whether, for example, a &quot;particle&quot; spoken about in particle physics is a discrete entity enjoying individual existence, or is an &quot;excitation mode&quot; of a region of a field, or is something else altogether. Instrumentalism holds that theoretical terms need only be useful to predict the phenomena, the observed outcomes.

There are multiple versions of instrumentalism.

==History==

===British empiricism===

Newton&#x27;s theory of motion, whereby any object instantly interacts with all other objects across the universe, motivated the founder of British empiricism, John Locke, to speculate that matter is capable of thought. The next leading British empiricist, George Berkeley, argued that an object&#x27;s putative primary qualities as recognized by scientists, such as shape, extension, and impenetrability, are inconceivable without the putative secondary qualities of color, hardness, warmth, and so on. He also posed the question how or why an object could be properly conceived to exist independently of any perception of it. Berkeley did not object to everyday talk about the reality of objects, but instead took issue with philosophers&#x27; talk, who spoke as if they knew something beyond sensory impressions that ordinary folk did not.

For Berkeley, a scientific theory does not state causes or explanations, but simply identifies perceived types of objects and traces their typical regularities. Berkeley thus anticipated the basis of what Auguste Comte in the 1830s called &quot;positivism&quot;, although Comtean positivism added other principles concerning the scope, method, and uses of science that Berkeley would have disavowed. Berkeley also noted the usefulness of a scientific theory having terms that merely serve to aid calculations without their having to refer to anything in particular, so long as they proved useful in practice. Berkeley thus predated the insight that logical positivists—who originated in the late 1920s, but who, by the 1950s, had softened into logical empiricists—would be compelled to accept: theoretical terms in science do not always translate into observational terms.

The last great British empiricist, David Hume, posed a number of challenges to Francis Bacon&#x27;s inductivism, which had been the prevailing, or at least the professed view concerning the attainment of scientific knowledge. Regarding himself as having placed his own theory of knowledge on par with Newton&#x27;s theory of motion, Hume supposed that he had championed inductivism over scientific realism. Upon reading Hume&#x27;s work, Immanuel Kant was &quot;awakened from dogmatic slumber&quot;, and thus sought to neutralise any threat to science posed by Humean empiricism. Kant would develop the first stark philosophy of physics.

===Transcendental idealism===

To save Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, Immanuel Kant reasoned that the mind is the precondition of experience and so, as the bridge from the noumena, which are how the world&#x27;s things exist in themselves, to the phenomena, which are humans&#x27; recognized experiences. And so mind itself contains the structure that determines &quot;space&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, and &quot;substance&quot;, how mind&#x27;s own categorization of noumena renders space Euclidean, time constant, and objects&#x27; motions exhibiting the very determinism predicted by Newtonian physics. Kant apparently presumed that the human mind, rather than a phenomenon itself that had evolved, had been predetermined and set forth upon the formation of humankind. In any event, the mind also was the veil of appearance that scientific methods could never lift. And yet the mind could ponder itself and discover such truths, although not on a theoretical level, but only by means of ethics. Kant&#x27;s metaphysics, then, transcendental idealism, secured science from doubt—in that it was a case of &quot;synthetic a priori&quot; knowledge (&quot;universal, necessary and informative&quot;)—and yet discarded hope of scientific realism.

===Logical empiricism===

Since the mind has virtually no power to know anything beyond direct sensory experience, Ernst Mach&#x27;s early version of logical positivism (empirio-criticism) verged on idealism. It was alleged to even be a surreptitious solipsism, whereby all that exists is one&#x27;s own mind. Mach&#x27;s positivism also strongly asserted the ultimate unity of the empirical sciences. Mach&#x27;s positivism asserted phenomenalism as to new basis of scientific theory, all scientific terms to refer to either actual or potential sensations, thus eliminating hypotheses while permitting such seemingly disparate scientific theories as physical and psychological to share terms and forms. Phenomenalism was insuperably difficult to implement, yet heavily influenced a new generation of philosophers of science, who emerged in the 1920s while terming themselves &quot;logical positivists&quot; while pursuing a program termed &quot;verificationism&quot;. Logical positivists aimed not to instruct or restrict scientists, but to enlighten and structure philosophical discourse to render &quot;scientific philosophy&quot; that would verify philosophical statements as well as scientific theories, and align all human knowledge into a &quot;scientific worldview&quot;, freeing humankind from so many of its problems due to confused or unclear language.

The verificationists expected a strict gap between &quot;theory&quot; versus &quot;observation&quot;, mirrored by a theory&#x27;s &quot;theoretical terms&quot; versus &quot;observable terms&quot;. Believing a theory&#x27;s posited unobservables to always correspond to observations, the verificationists viewed a scientific theory&#x27;s theoretical terms, such as &quot;electron&quot;, as metaphorical or elliptical at observations, such as &quot;white streak in cloud chamber&quot;. They believed that scientific terms lacked meanings unto themselves, but acquired meanings from the logical structure that was the entire theory that in turn matched &quot;patterns of experience&quot;. So by translating theoretical terms into observational terms and then decoding the theory&#x27;s mathematical/logical structure, one could check whether the statement indeed matched patterns of experience, and thereby verify the scientific theory false or true. Such verification would be possible, as never before in science, since translation of theoretical terms into observational terms would make the scientific theory purely empirical, none metaphysical. Yet the logical positivists ran into insuperable difficulties. Moritz Schlick debated with Otto Neurath over foundationalism—the traditional view traced to Descartes as founder of modern Western philosophy—whereupon only nonfoundationalism was found tenable. Science, then, could not find a secure foundation of indubitable truth.

And since science aims to reveal not private but public truths, verificationists switched from phenomenalism to physicalism, whereby scientific theory refers to objects observable in space and at least in principle already recognizable by physicists. Finding strict empiricism untenable, verificationism underwent &quot;liberalization of empiricism&quot;. Rudolf Carnap even suggested that empiricism&#x27;s basis was pragmatic. Recognizing that verification—proving a theory false or true—was unattainable, they discarded that demand and focused on &quot;confirmation theory&quot;. Carnap sought simply to quantify a universal law&#x27;s &quot;degree of confirmation&quot;—its probable truth—but, despite his great mathematical and logical skill, discovered equations never operable to yield over &quot;zero&quot; degree of confirmation. Carl Hempel found the paradox of confirmation. By the 1950s, the verificationists had established philosophy of science as subdiscipline within academia&#x27;s philosophy departments. By 1962, verificationists had asked and endeavored to answer seemingly all the great questions about scientific theory. Their discoveries showed that the idealized &quot;scientific worldview&quot; was naively mistaken. By then the leader of the legendary venture, Hempel raised the white flag that signaled verificationism&#x27;s demise. Suddenly striking Western society, then, was Kuhn&#x27;s landmark thesis, introduced by none other than Carnap, verificationism&#x27;s greatest firebrand. Instrumentalism exhibited by &quot;scientists&quot; often does not even discern unobservable from observable entities.

===Historical turn===

From the 1930s until Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s 1962 &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;, there were roughly two prevailing views about the nature of science. The popular view was scientific realism, which usually involved a belief that science was progressively unveiling a truer view, and building a better understanding, of nature. The professional approach was logical empiricism, wherein a scientific theory was held to be a logical structure whose terms all ultimately refer to some form of observation, while an objective process neutrally arbitrates theory choice, compelling scientists to decide which scientific theory was superior. Physicists knew better, but, busy developing the Standard Model, were so steeped in developing quantum field theory, that their talk, largely metaphorical, perhaps even metaphysical, was unintelligible to the public, while the steep mathematics warded off philosophers of physics. By the 1980s, physicists regarded not &quot;particles&quot;, but &quot;fields&quot; as the more fundamental, and no longer even hoped to discover what entities and processes might be truly fundamental to nature, perhaps not even the field. Kuhn had not claimed to have developed a novel thesis, but instead hoped to synthesize more usefully recent developments in the philosophy and history of science.

=== Scientific realism ===
One scientific realist, Karl Popper, rejected all variants of positivism via its focus on sensations rather than realism, and developed critical rationalism instead. Popper alleged that instrumentalism reduces basic science to what is merely applied science. The British physicist David Deutsch, in his much later 1997 book &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;, followed Popper&#x27;s critique of instrumentalism and argued that a scientific theory stripped of its explanatory content would be of strictly limited utility.

===Constructive empiricism as a form of instrumentalism===

Bas van Fraassen&#x27;s (1980) project of constructive empiricism focuses on belief in the domain of the observable, so for this reason it is described as a form of instrumentalism.

==In the philosophy of mind==
In the philosophy of mind, instrumentalism is the view that propositional attitudes like beliefs are not actually concepts on which we can base scientific investigations of mind and brain, but that acting as if other beings have beliefs is a successful strategy.

== Relation to pragmatism ==
Instrumentalism is closely related to pragmatism, the position that practical consequences are an essential basis for determining meaning, truth or value.

<doc id="270804" wikidata="Q431354" url="?curid=270804" title="Scientific realism">
<text>Scientific realism is the view that the universe described by science is real regardless of how it may be interpreted. A believer of scientific realism takes the universe as described by science to be true (or approximately true), because of their assertion that science can be used to find the truth (or approximate truth) about both the physical and metaphysical in the Universe.

Within philosophy of science, this view is often an answer to the question &quot;how is the success of science to be explained?&quot; The discussion on the success of science in this context centers primarily on the status of unobservable entities apparently talked about by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists assert that one can make valid claims about unobservables (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as observables, as opposed to instrumentalism.

==Main features==
Scientific realism involves two basic positions:

*First, it is a set of claims about the features of an ideal scientific theory; an ideal theory is the sort of theory science aims to produce. 

*Second, it is the commitment that science will eventually produce theories very much like an ideal theory and that science has done pretty well thus far in some domains. 

One might be a scientific realist regarding some sciences while not being a realist regarding others.

According to scientific realism, an ideal scientific theory has the following features:
*The claims the theory makes are either true or false, depending on whether the entities talked about by the theory exist and are correctly described by the theory. This is the semantic commitment of scientific realism.
*The entities described by the scientific theory exist objectively and mind-independently. This is the metaphysical commitment of scientific realism.
*There are reasons to believe some significant portion of what the theory says. This is the epistemological commitment.

Combining the first and the second claim entails that an ideal scientific theory says definite things about genuinely existing entities. The third claim says that we have reasons to believe that many scientific claims about these entities are true, but not all.

Scientific realism usually holds that science makes progress, i.e. scientific theories usually get successively better, or, rather, answer more and more questions. For this reason, scientific realists or otherwise, hold that realism should make sense of the progress of science in terms of theories being successively more like the ideal theory that scientific realists describe.

===Characteristic claims===
The following claims are typical of those held by scientific realists. Due to the wide disagreements over the nature of science&#x27;s success and the role of realism in its success, a scientific realist would agree with some but not all of the following positions.
*The best scientific theories are at least partially true.
*The best theories do not employ central terms that are non referring expressions.
*To say that a theory is approximately true is sufficient explanation of the degree of its predictive success.
*The approximate truth of a theory is the only explanation of its predictive success.
*Even if a theory employs expressions that do not have a reference, a scientific theory may be approximately true.
*Scientific theories are in a historical process of progress towards a true account of the physical world.
*Scientific theories make genuine, existential claims.
*Theoretical claims of scientific theories should be read literally and are definitively either true or false.
*The degree of the predictive success of a theory is evidence of the referential success of its central terms.
*The goal of science is an account of the physical world that is literally true. Science has been successful because this is the goal that it has been making progress towards.

==History==

Scientific realism is related to much older philosophical positions including rationalism and metaphysical realism. However, it is a thesis about science developed in the twentieth century. Portraying scientific realism in terms of its ancient, medieval, and early modern cousins is at best misleading.

Scientific realism is developed largely as a reaction to logical positivism. Logical positivism was the first philosophy of science in the twentieth century and the forerunner of scientific realism, holding that a sharp distinction can be drawn between theoretical terms and observational terms, the latter capable of semantic analysis in observational and logical terms.

Logical positivism encountered difficulties with:
*The verificationist theory of meaning—see Hempel (1950).
*Troubles with the analytic-synthetic distinction—see Quine (1950).
*The theory-ladenness of observation—see Hanson (1958) Kuhn (1970) and Quine (1960).
*Difficulties moving from the observationality of terms to observationality of sentences—see Putnam (1962).
*The vagueness of the observational-theoretical distinction—see G. Maxwell (1962).

These difficulties for logical positivism suggest, but do not entail, scientific realism, and led to the development of realism as a philosophy of science.

Realism became the dominant philosophy of science after positivism. Bas van Fraassen in his book &quot;The Scientific Image&quot; (1980) developed constructive empiricism as an alternative to realism. He argues against scientific realism that scientific theories do not aim for truth about unobservable entities. Responses to van Fraassen have sharpened realist positions and led to some revisions of scientific realism.

==Arguments for and against scientific realism==
=== No miracles argument ===
One of the main arguments for scientific realism centers on the notion that scientific knowledge is progressive in nature, and that it is able to predict phenomena successfully. Many scientific realists (e.g., Ernan McMullin, Richard Boyd) think the operational success of a theory lends credence to the idea that its more unobservable aspects exist, because they were how the theory reasoned its predictions. For example, a scientific realist would argue that science must derive some ontological support for atoms from the outstanding phenomenological success of all the theories using them.

Arguments for scientific realism often appeal to abductive reasoning or &quot;inference to the best explanation&quot; (Lipton, 2004). For instance, one argument commonly used—the &quot;miracle argument&quot; or &quot;no miracles argument&quot;—starts out by observing that scientific theories are highly successful in predicting and explaining a variety of phenomena, often with great accuracy. Thus, it is argued that the best explanation—the only explanation that renders the success of science to not be what Hilary Putnam calls &quot;a miracle&quot;—is the view that our scientific theories (or at least the best ones) provide true descriptions of the world, or approximately so.

Bas van Fraassen replies with an evolutionary analogy: &quot;I claim that the success of current scientific theories is no miracle. It is not even surprising to the scientific (Darwinist) mind. For any scientific theory is born into a life of fierce competition, a jungle red in tooth and claw. Only the successful theories survive—the ones which in fact latched on to actual regularities in nature.&quot; (&quot;The Scientific Image&quot;, 1980)

Some philosophers (e.g. Colin Howson) have argued that the no miracles argument commits the base rate fallacy.

=== Pessimistic induction ===
Pessimistic induction, one of the main arguments against realism, argues that the history of science contains many theories once regarded as empirically successful but which are now believed to be false. Additionally, the history of science contains many empirically successful theories whose unobservable terms are not believed to genuinely refer. For example, the effluvium theory of static electricity (a theory of the 16th Century physicist William Gilbert) is an empirically successful theory whose central unobservable terms have been replaced by later theories.

Realists reply that replacement of particular realist theories with better ones is to be expected due to the progressive nature of scientific knowledge, and when such replacements occur only superfluous unobservables are dropped. For example, Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity showed that the concept of the luminiferous ether could be dropped because it had contributed nothing to the success of the theories of mechanics and electromagnetism. On the other hand, when theory replacement occurs, a well-supported concept, such as the concept of atoms, is not dropped but is incorporated into the new theory in some form. These replies can lead scientific realists to structural realism.

=== Constructivist epistemology ===
Social constructivists might argue that scientific realism is unable to account for the rapid change that occurs in scientific knowledge during periods of scientific revolution. Constructivists may also argue that the success of theories is only a part of the construction. 

However, these arguments ignore the fact that many scientists are not realists. During the development of quantum mechanics in the 1920s, the dominant philosophy of science was logical positivism. The alternative realist Bohm interpretation and many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics do not make such a revolutionary break with the concepts of classical physics.

=== Underdetermination problem ===
Another argument against scientific realism, deriving from the underdetermination problem, is not so historically motivated as these others. It claims that observational data can in principle be explained by multiple theories that are mutually incompatible. Realists might counter by saying that there have been few actual cases of underdetermination in the history of science. Usually the requirement of explaining the data is so exacting that scientists are lucky to find even one theory that fulfills it. Furthermore, if we take the underdetermination argument seriously, it implies that we can know about only what we have directly observed. For example, we could not theorize that dinosaurs once lived based on the fossil evidence because other theories (e.g., that the fossils are clever hoaxes) can account for the same data.

=== Incompatible models argument ===

According to the incompatible models argument, in certain cases the existence of diverse models for a single phenomenon can be taken as evidence of anti-realism. One example is due to Margaret Morrison, who worked to show that the shell model and the liquid-drop model give contradictory descriptions of the atomic nucleus, even though both models are predictive.

<text>Surgical stainless steel is a grade of stainless steel used in biomedical applications. The most common &quot;surgical steels&quot; are austenitic SAE 316 stainless and martensitic SAE 440, SAE 420, and 17-4 stainless steels. There is no formal definition on what constitutes a &quot;surgical stainless steel&quot;, so product manufacturers and distributors often apply the term to refer to any grade of corrosion resistant steel.

==Medical grade stainless==
SAE 316 and SAE 316L stainless steel, also referred to as &quot;marine grade stainless&quot;, is a chromium, nickel, molybdenum alloy of steel that exhibits relatively good strength and corrosion resistance. 316L is the low carbon version of 316 stainless steel.

316L in particular is biocompatible when produced to ASTM F138 / F139. It is a common choice for biomedical implants, as well as body piercings and body modification implants. Immune system reaction to nickel is a potential complication of stainless steel usage within the human body. There are nickel-free nitrogen-strengthened austenitic stainless steel alloys available which address this concern.

316 surgical steel is also used in the manufacture and handling of food and pharmaceutical products where it is often required in order to minimize metallic contamination.

The corrosion resistance properties of all stainless steels is greatly enhanced by the passivation process. ASTM A967 details this process.

==Cutlery grade stainless==
SAE 440 and SAE 420 stainless steels, known also by the name &quot;Cutlery Stainless Steel&quot;, are high carbon steels alloyed with chromium. They have very good corrosion resistance compared to other cutlery steels, but their corrosion resistance is inferior to 316 stainless. Surgical cutting instruments are often made from 440 or 420 stainless due to its high hardness coupled with acceptable corrosion resistance. This type of stainless steel may be slightly magnetic.

General surgical tools are made from other chromium-bearing stainless steels, such as 17-4. ASTM F899 contains a list of commonly used metals for surgical instruments.

<doc id="270811" wikidata="Q6694023" url="?curid=270811" title="Lowest temperature recorded on Earth">
<text>The lowest natural temperature ever directly recorded at ground level on Earth is at the then-Soviet Vostok Station in Antarctica on 21 July 1983 by ground measurements.

On 10 August 2010, satellite observations showed a surface temperature of at , along a ridge between Dome Argus and Dome Fuji, at elevation. The result was reported at the 46th annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California, in December 2013; it is a provisional figure, and may be subject to revision. The value is not listed as the record lowest temperature as it was measured by remote sensing from satellite and not by ground-based thermometers, unlike the 1983 record. The temperature announced reflects that of the ice surface, while the Vostok readings measured the air above the ice, and so the two are not directly comparable. More recent work shows many locations in the high Antarctic where surface temperatures drop to approximately . Due to the very strong temperature gradient near the surface, these imply near-surface air temperature minima of approximately .

==Historical progression==
On 21 January 1838, a Russian merchant named Neverov recorded a temperature of in Yakutsk. On 15 January 1885, H. Wild reported that a temperature of was measured in Verkhoyansk. A later measurement at the same place in February 1892 was reported as . Soviet researchers later announced a recording of in February 1933 at Oymyakon, about to the south-east of Verkhoyansk; this measurement was reported by Soviet texts through the 1940s as a record low, with the previous measurement from Verkhoyansk retroactively adjusted to .

The next reliable measurement was made during the 1957 season at the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica, yielding on 11 May and on 17 September. The next world record low temperature was a reading of , measured at the Soviet Vostok Station in 1968, on the Antarctic Plateau. Vostok again broke its own record with a reading of on 21 July 1983. This remains the record for a directly recorded temperature.

==Laboratory cooling==
===Early experiments===
In 1904 Dutch scientist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes created a special lab in Leiden in the Netherlands with the aim of producing liquid helium. In 1908 he managed to lower the temperature to less than −269 °C (−452.2 F, 4 K), which is four degrees above absolute zero. Only in this exceptionally cold state will helium liquefy; the boiling point of helium being at −268.94 °C (−452.092 F). Kamerlingh Onnes received a Nobel Prize for his achievement.

Onnes&#x27; method relied upon depressurising the subject gases, causing them to cool by adiabatic cooling. This follows from the first law of thermodynamics;

formula_1

where &quot;U&quot; = internal energy, &quot;Q&quot; = heat added to the system, &quot;W&quot; = work done by the system.

Consider a gas in a box of set volume. If the pressure in the box is higher than atmospheric pressure, then upon opening the gas will do work on the surrounding atmosphere to expand. As this expansion is adiabatic and the gas has done work

formula_2

formula_3

formula_4

Now as the internal energy has decreased, so has the temperature.

===Modern experiments===
As of November 2000, nuclear spin temperatures below 100 pK were reported for an experiment at the Helsinki University of Technology Low Temperature Lab. However, this was the temperature of one particular type of motion—a quantum property called nuclear spin—not the overall average thermodynamic temperature for all possible degrees of freedom. At such low temperatures, the concept of &quot;temperature&quot; becomes multifaceted since molecular motion cannot be assumed to average out across degrees of freedom. The corresponding peak emission will be in radio waves, rather than in the familiar infrared, so it is very inefficiently absorbed by neighboring atoms, making it difficult to reach thermal equilibrium.

The Low Temperature Laboratory recorded a record low temperature of 100 pK, or 1.0 × 10−10 K in 1999.

The current apparatus for achieving low temperatures has two stages. The first uses a helium dilution refrigerator to get to temperatures of millikelvins, then the next stage uses adiabatic nuclear demagnetisation to reach picokelvins.

Extremely low temperatures are useful for observation of quantum mechanical phases of matter such as superfluids and Bose–Einstein condensates, which would be disrupted by thermal motion.

In probability theory and statistics, the Gumbel distribution (also known as the type-I [[generalized extreme value distribution]]) is used to model the distribution of the maximum (or the minimum) of a number of samples of various distributions.

This distribution might be used to represent the distribution of the maximum level of a river in a particular year if there was a list of maximum values for the past ten years. It is useful in predicting the chance that an extreme earthquake, flood or other natural disaster will occur. The potential applicability of the Gumbel distribution to represent the distribution of maxima relates to extreme value theory, which indicates that it is likely to be useful if the distribution of the underlying sample data is of the normal or exponential type.

The Gumbel distribution is a particular case of the generalized extreme value distribution (also known as the Fisher–Tippett distribution). It is also known as the &quot;log-Weibull distribution&quot; and the &quot;double exponential distribution&quot; (a term that is alternatively sometimes used to refer to the Laplace distribution). It is related to the Gompertz distribution: when its density is first reflected about the origin and then restricted to the positive half line, a Gompertz function is obtained.

In the latent variable formulation of the multinomial logit model — common in discrete choice theory — the errors of the latent variables follow a Gumbel distribution. This is useful because the difference of two Gumbel-distributed random variables has a logistic distribution.

The Gumbel distribution is named after Emil Julius Gumbel (1891–1966), based on his original papers describing the distribution.

==Definitions==
The cumulative distribution function of the Gumbel distribution is

:formula_13

===Standard Gumbel distribution===
The standard Gumbel distribution is the case where formula_14 and formula_15 with cumulative distribution function
:formula_16

and probability density function 
:formula_17

In this case the mode is 0, the median is formula_18, the mean is formula_19 (the Euler–Mascheroni constant), and the standard deviation is formula_20

The cumulants, for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, are given by 
:formula_21

==Properties==
The mode is μ, while the median is formula_22 and the mean is given by
:formula_23,
where formula_24 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant.

The standard deviation formula_25 is formula_26 hence formula_27 

At the mode, where formula_28, the value of formula_29 becomes formula_30, irrespective of the value of formula_31

If formula_32 are iid Gumbel random variables with parameters formula_33 then formula_34 is also a Gumbel random variable with parameters formula_35. 

If formula_36 are iid random variables such that formula_37 has the same distribution as formula_38 for all natural numbers formula_39, then formula_38 is necessarily Gumbel distributed with scale parameter formula_41 (actually it suffices to consider just two distinct values of k&gt;1 which are coprime).

==Related distributions==
===The discrete Gumbel distribution===
Many problems in discrete mathematics involve the study of an extremal parameter that follows a discrete version of the Gumbel distribution. This &quot;discrete&quot; version is the law of formula_42, where formula_43 follows the &quot;continuous&quot; Gumbel distribution formula_44.
Accordingly, this gives formula_45 for any formula_46.

Denoting formula_47 as the discrete version, one has formula_48 and formula_49.

There is no known closed form for the mean, variance (or higher-order moments) of the discrete Gumbel distribution, but it is easy to obtain high-precision numerical evaluations via rapidly converging infinite sums. For example, this yields formula_50, but it remains an open problem to find a closed form for this constant (it is plausible there is none).

Aguech, Althagafi, and Banderier provide various bounds linking the discrete and continuous versions of the Gumbel distribution and explicitly detail (using methods from Mellin transform) the oscillating phenomena that appear when one has a sequence of random variables formula_51 converging to a discrete Gumbel distribution.

===Continuous distributions===
* If formula_52 has a Gumbel distribution, then the conditional distribution of &quot;Y&quot; = −&quot;X&quot; given that &quot;Y&quot; is positive, or equivalently given that &quot;X&quot; is negative, has a Gompertz distribution. The cdf &quot;G&quot; of &quot;Y&quot; is related to &quot;F&quot;, the cdf of &quot;X&quot;, by the formula formula_53 for &quot;y&quot; &gt; 0. Consequently, the densities are related by formula_54: the Gompertz density is proportional to a reflected Gumbel density, restricted to the positive half-line.
* If &quot;X&quot; is an exponentially distributed variable with mean 1, then −log(&quot;X&quot;) has a standard Gumbel distribution.
* If formula_55 and formula_56 are independent, then formula_57 (see Logistic distribution).
* Despite this, if formula_58 are independent, then formula_59. This can easily be seen by noting that formula_60 (where formula_3 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant). Instead, the distribution of linear combinations of independent Gumbel random variables can be approximated by GNIG and GIG distributions.

Theory related to the generalized multivariate log-gamma distribution provides a multivariate version of the Gumbel distribution.

==Occurrence and applications==
===Applications of the continous Gumbel distribution===
Gumbel has shown that the maximum value (or last order statistic) in a sample of random variables following an exponential distribution minus the natural logarithm of the sample size approaches the Gumbel distribution as the sample size increases.

Concretely, let formula_62 be the probability distribution of formula_63 and formula_64 its cumulative distribution. Then the maximum value out of formula_65 realizations of formula_63 is smaller than formula_67 if and only if all realizations are smaller than formula_67. So the cumulative distribution of the maximum value formula_69 satisfies
:formula_70
and, for large formula_65, the right-hand-side converges to formula_72

In hydrology, therefore, the Gumbel distribution is used to analyze such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes, and also to describe droughts.
Gumbel has also shown that the estimator for the probability of an event — where &quot;r&quot; is the rank number of the observed value in the data series and &quot;n&quot; is the total number of observations — is an unbiased estimator of the cumulative probability around the mode of the distribution. Therefore, this estimator is often used as a plotting position.

===Occurrences of the discrete Gumbel distribution===
In combinatorics, the discrete Gumbel distribution appears as a limiting distribution for the hitting time in the coupon collector&#x27;s problem. This result was first established by Laplace in 1812 in his &quot;Théorie analytique des probabilités&quot;, marking the first historical occurrence of what would later be called the Gumbel distribution.

In number theory, the Gumbel distribution approximates the number of terms in a random partition of an integer as well as the trend-adjusted sizes of maximal prime gaps and maximal gaps between prime constellations.

In probability theory, it appears as the distribution of the maximum height reached by discrete walks (on the lattice formula_73), where the process can be reset to its starting point at each step.

In analysis of algorithms, it appears, for example, in the study of the maximum carry propagation in base-formula_74 addition algorithms.

==Random variate generation==
Since the quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution function), formula_75, of a Gumbel distribution is given by

:formula_76

the variate formula_77 has a Gumbel distribution with parameters formula_5 and formula_41 when the random variate formula_80 is drawn from the uniform distribution on the interval formula_81.

===Probability paper===
In pre-software times probability paper was used to picture the Gumbel distribution (see illustration). The paper is based on linearization of the cumulative distribution function formula_82 :
: formula_83
In the paper the horizontal axis is constructed at a double log scale. The vertical axis is linear. By plotting formula_82 on the horizontal axis of the paper and the formula_85-variable on the vertical axis, the distribution is represented by a straight line with a slope 1formula_86. When distribution fitting software like CumFreq became available, the task of plotting the distribution was made easier.

=== Gumbel reparameterization tricks ===
In machine learning, the Gumbel distribution is sometimes employed to generate samples from the categorical distribution. This technique is called &quot;Gumbel-max trick&quot; and is a special example of &quot;reparameterization tricks&quot;.

In detail, let formula_87 be nonnegative, and not all zero, and let formula_88 be independent samples of Gumbel(0, 1), then by routine integration,formula_89That is, formula_90

Equivalently, given any formula_91, we can sample from its Boltzmann distribution by

formula_92Related equations include:
* If formula_93, then formula_94.
* formula_90.
* formula_96. That is, the Gumbel distribution is a max-stable distribution family.
* formula_97

<doc id="270839" wikidata="Q575976" url="?curid=270839" title="Jurassic Coast">
<text>The Jurassic Coast (also Dorset and East Devon Coast) is a World Heritage Site on the English Channel coast of southern England. It stretches from Exmouth in East Devon to Studland Bay in Dorset, a distance of about , and was inscribed on the World Heritage List in mid-December 2001.

The site spans 185 million years of geological history, coastal erosion having exposed an almost continuous sequence of rock formation covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. At different times, this area has been desert, shallow tropical sea and marsh, and the fossilised remains of the various creatures that lived there have been preserved in the rocks.

Natural features seen on this stretch of coast include arches, pinnacles and stack rocks. In some places the sea has broken through resistant rocks to produce coves with restricted entrances and, in one place, the Isle of Portland is connected to the land by a barrier beach. In some parts of the coast, landslides are common. These have exposed a wide range of fossils, the different rock types each having its own typical fauna and flora, thus providing evidence of how animals and plants evolved in this region.

The area around Lulworth Cove contains a fossil forest, and 71 different rock strata have been identified at Lyme Regis, each with its own species of ammonite. The fossil collector Mary Anning lived here and her major discoveries of marine reptiles and other fossils were made at a time when the study of palaeontology was just starting to develop. The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre provides information on the heritage coast, and the whole length of the site can be visited via the South West Coast Path.

==World Heritage Site==
The Jurassic Coast stretches from Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon to Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in East Dorset, a distance of . Inscribed on the World Heritage List in 2001, the Jurassic Coast was the first wholly natural World Heritage Site to be designated in the United Kingdom. At Orcombe Point, the &quot;Geoneedle&quot; (2002), an acute pyramidal sculpture, marks the western end of the heritage site; this is built out of fragments of the different types of rocks to be seen along the coast.

The UNESCO World Heritage Committee nomination document lists eight segments of coast included in the site. The segments are:

* from Orcombe Rocks to Chit Rocks, Sidmouth
* from River Sid, Sidmouth to Seaton Hole
* the Axmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliff, from the mouth of the River Axe to The Cobb in Lyme Regis
* from Lyme Regis to West Bay
* Chesil Beach, the Fleet Lagoon and the Isle of Portland Coast
* Portland Harbour Shore
* from Bowleaze Cove to Peveril Point
* from New Swanage to Studland Bay

The cliffs on this part of the coast are being eroded as sections crumble away and landslides occur. These processes reveal successive layers of sedimentary rock, uncovering the geological history at the modern coastline over a period of 185 million years, and disclosing an almost continuous sequence of rock formations covering the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossils found in the area and the coastal geomorphologic features of this dynamic coast, have advanced the study of earth sciences for more than two hundred years. The area covered by the designation comprises the land between the mean low water mark and the top of the cliffs or the back of the beach.

The fossils found in abundance along this coastline provide evidence of how animals and plants evolved in this region. During the Triassic this area was a desert, while in the Jurassic it was part of a tropical sea, and in the Cretaceous it was covered by swamps. The fossilised remains of the animals and plants that lived in those periods are very well preserved, providing a wealth of information on their body shapes, the way they died and even the fossilised remains of their last meals. Fossil groups found here include crustaceans, insects, molluscs, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, reptiles and a few mammals. At Lulworth Cove there is a fossil forest of conifers, tree-ferns and cycads.

== Geography ==

The Jurassic Coast consists of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous cliffs, spanning the Mesozoic, documenting 185 million years of geological history. The site can be best viewed from the sea, when the dipping nature of the rock strata becomes apparent.

In East Devon, the coastal cliffs consist of steep cliffs of red sandstone from the Triassic, and at Budleigh Salterton, the gravel cliffs contain red quartzite pebbles which accumulate on the beach below as Budleigh pebbles, locally protected. Further east at Ladram Bay, more sandstone cliffs give rise to spectacular red sandstone stacks.

Around Lyme Regis and Charmouth the cliffs are of Jurassic clays and shale, and landslips are common. Chesil Beach is a good example of a barrier beach and stretches for from Burton Bradstock to the Isle of Portland. The beach encloses an intertidal lagoon which is an internationally important Ramsar Convention site known for its biodiversity.

At Lulworth Cove, the waves have cut their way through the resistant Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs.

The highest point on the Jurassic Coast, and on the entire south coast of Britain, is Golden Cap at between Bridport and Charmouth.

This coast shows excellent examples of landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and a tied island, the Isle of Portland. Chesil Beach is a fine example of both a tombolo (a deposition landform in which an island is attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a spit or bar) and a storm beach (a beach affected by particularly fierce waves). The site has stretches of both concordant and discordant coastlines. Due to the quality of the varied geology, the site is the subject of international field studies.

The many sedimentary layers on this coastline are rich with fossils, the remains of the animals and plants present in the area whose tissues became immersed in deposits of mud which later hardened into rock. At Lyme Regis, for example, geologists have identified 71 layers of rock, each one containing fossils of a different species of ammonite.

== History ==
At the end of the 18th century Georges Cuvier showed that some fossil animals resembled no living ones, thus demonstrating that animals could become extinct; this led to the emergence of palaeontology, the study of fossils. The coasts of eastern Devon and western Dorset were rich in fossil beds, but before this time the fossils had merely been gathered as a pastime or collected by local residents and sold to visitors as curios.

Mary Anning (1799–1847) lived in Lyme Regis and followed in her father&#x27;s footsteps as a collector. She became an expert on the fossils to be found in the Blue Lias around the town and discovered the first complete Ichthyosaur skeleton at The Spittles. Other important discoveries of ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and a pterosaur followed, as well as invertebrates such as cephalopods and their ink sacs.

During World War II several sections of the Jurassic Coast became the property of the Ministry of War. One of the Royal Navy&#x27;s largest bases was at Portland Harbour, though it has since closed. A major army base at Bovington remains in use today. Large areas of land, including the coast between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge, are still only partially accessible; this includes the ghost village of Tyneham which was evacuated after being requisitioned by the army in 1943.

Areas of the coast near Exmouth, The Fleet Lagoon at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for military training but have since been returned to civilian use.

Parts of the coast, especially around Portland, can be dangerous, and shipwrecks have been a feature of the coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC &quot;Napoli&quot;, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.

==Management and access==

The Jurassic Coast is subject to severe weather conditions at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape and management of the site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but in other places, where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.

The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre is an independent educational charity situated near the beach in Charmouth; it provides information and displays on the geology of the area and the wildlife, including a large collection of fossils and a rockpool aquarium. Family fossil-hunting trips are organised from here as well as other events and activities related to the geology and natural history of the area.

The entire length of the coast can be walked on the South West Coast Path. Landslips and rockfalls are a continuing feature of the evolution of this coast. On 6 May 2008, a section of the coast was dramatically re-shaped after a landslip that was described as the worst in 100 years. There was a fatality in 2012 when of rock fell onto the beach at Burton Bradstock and another cliff fall took place in 2016 at West Bay, near Bridport. There was a further cliff collapse at Hive Beach near the village of Burton Bradstock shortly before dawn on 29 August 2020 after prolonged rain fall. The public were warned to stay clear of the unstable rocks. On 15 April 2021, a further collapse occurred. The collapse was described as being the biggest UK rockfall in 60 years.

<text>The Minnesota North Stars were a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 26 seasons, from 1967 to 1993. The North Stars played their home games at the Met Center in Bloomington, Minnesota, and the team&#x27;s colors for most of its history were green, yellow, gold and white. The North Stars played 2,062 regular season games and made the NHL playoffs 17 times, including two Stanley Cup Finals appearances, but were unable to win the Stanley Cup. After the 1992–93 season, the franchise moved to Dallas, and the team was renamed the Dallas Stars.

==History==

===Beginnings===
On March 11, 1965, NHL President Clarence Campbell announced that the league would expand to 12 teams from six by creating a new six-team division for the 1967–68 season. In response to the announcement, a partnership of nine men, led by Walter Bush, Jr., Robert Ridder, and John Driscoll, was formed to seek a franchise for the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. Their efforts were successful, as the NHL awarded one of its six expansion franchises to Minnesota on February 9, 1966. The five other franchises were awarded to Oakland, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis. The expansion fee for each new team was $2 million ($ in dollars). The &quot;North Stars&quot; name was announced on May 25, 1966, after a public contest. The name derives from the state motto, &quot;L&#x27;Étoile du Nord&quot;, a French phrase meaning &quot;The Star of the North&quot;. Months after the naming of the team, ground was broken on October 3, 1966, for a new hockey arena in Bloomington. The home of the North Stars, the Metropolitan Sports Center, was built in 12 months at a cost of $7 million ($ in dollars). The arena was ready for play for the start of the 1967–68 NHL season, but parts of its construction were incomplete. Spectator seats were still being installed as fans arrived for the opening home game on October 21, 1967.

===Early years===

On October 11, 1967, the North Stars played the first game in franchise history on the road against the St. Louis Blues, another expansion team. The game was a 2–2 tie, with former US National Team forward Bill Masterton scoring the first goal in franchise history. On October 21, 1967, the North Stars played their first home game, against the California Seals. The North Stars won 3–1. The team achieved success early, reaching first place in the West Division halfway through the 1967–68 season. Tragedy struck the team on January 13, 1968, when Masterton suffered a fatal hit during a game against the Seals at Met Center. Skating towards the Seals goal across the blue line, he fell backward, hitting the back of his head on the ice, rendering him unconscious. He never regained consciousness and died on January 15, 1968, two days after the accident. He was 29. Doctors described the cause of death as a &quot;massive brain injury&quot;. To date, this remains the only death of a player as a result of an injury during a game in NHL history. The North Stars retired his jersey, and later that year, hockey writers established the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which would be given annually to a player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey. Following the news of Masterton&#x27;s death, the North Stars lost the next six games.

The North Stars achieved success in their first year of existence by finishing fourth in the West Division with a record of 27–32–15 and advancing to the playoffs. During the 1968 playoffs, the North Stars defeated the Los Angeles Kings in seven games after losing the first two in the series. In the next round, the West finals, the North Stars faced the St. Louis Blues in a series that also went seven games. Minnesota was one game away from advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals but lost the deciding game in double overtime.

The team was led in the early years by the goaltending duo Lorne &quot;Gump&quot; Worsley and Cesare Maniago. Defenseman Ted Harris was the North Stars&#x27; captain. The first Stars team also included high-scoring winger Bill Goldsworthy and other quality players such as Barry Gibbs, Jude Drouin, J. P. Parise, Danny Grant, Lou Nanne, Tom Reid and Dennis Hextall.

The World Hockey Association (WHA) began play in 1972 with a franchise based in St. Paul, the Minnesota Fighting Saints. While a number of exhibition games were played between teams in the two leagues, the North Stars never played their cross-town rivals. But the competition for the hockey dollar between these two clubs was fierce. Despite making a good account of themselves on the ice, insurmountable financial difficulties forced the Fighting Saints to fold midway through their fourth season. A second incarnation of the Fighting Saints lasted only half of the next season before also folding.

By 1978 the North Stars had missed the playoffs in five of the previous six seasons, and had only tallied two winning seasons since joining the league. Attendance had tailed off so rapidly that the league feared that the franchise was on the verge of folding. At this point, Gordon and George Gund III, owners of the equally strapped Cleveland Barons, stepped in with an unprecedented solution—merging the North Stars with the Barons. The merged team retained the North Stars name, colors, and history, and remained in Minnesota. But the wealthier Gunds became majority owners of the merged team, and the North Stars moved from the then five-team Smythe Division to the Barons&#x27; place in the Adams Division (which would otherwise have been left with only three teams) for the 1978–79 season. The recently retired Nanne was named general manager, and some of the Barons players – notably goaltender Gilles Meloche and forwards Al MacAdam and Mike Fidler – bolstered Minnesota&#x27;s lineup. Furthermore, Minnesota had drafted Bobby Smith, who went on to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top rookie that year, and Steve Payne, who recorded 42 goals in his second campaign in 1979–80.

On January 15, 1979, the North Stars defeated the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden, 8–1. Tim Young became the second player in NHL history to score five goals on five shots. His five-goal game remains the best offensive output by a player in the Minnesota/Dallas franchise.

===1980s===
In the middle of this transition, a historic night awaited the North Stars. On January 7, 1980, Minnesota was scheduled to play the Philadelphia Flyers, who came to Bloomington with the NHL&#x27;s and major league sports’ longest undefeated streak, a 35-game run of 25 wins and 10 ties. An all-time record Met Center crowd of 15,962 squeezed into the arena, which remained the highest total in all 26 seasons of the North Stars franchise. Minnesota ended the Flyers&#x27; streak with a 7–1 win. Seven different North Stars scored seven unanswered goals. In the quarterfinals of the 1980 playoffs, the North Stars upset the four-time defending champion Montreal Canadiens in seven games before bowing out to Philadelphia in the next round.

With the addition of new players such as Minnesota native and 1980 Olympian Neal Broten and sniper Dino Ciccarelli, the North Stars had five straight winning seasons starting in 1979–80, which included back-to-back trips to the Stanley Cup semifinals, against the Flyers in 1980 and against the Calgary Flames in 1981. By defeating the Flames in 1981, the North Stars reached their first Stanley Cup Finals. They lost in five games to the heavily favored New York Islanders.

On November 11, 1981, the Winnipeg Jets visited Met Center. Fueled by an eight-goal second period, and a four-goal, seven-point night by Bobby Smith, the North Stars scored the most goals in an NHL game since 1944 in a 15–2 win.

Following the 1981 NHL realignment to a more geographically grouped configuration, the North Stars were in the Norris Division. Ciccarelli scored a franchise record 55 goals in just his second season in 1981–82, leading Minnesota to its first division title. The team bowed out of the playoffs in the first round against the Chicago Black Hawks.

In the summer of 1982, general manager Lou Nanne drafted Brian Bellows, who scored 35 goals in his rookie season of 1982–83, when the team finished with 40 wins and 96 regular season points – both the most ever recorded in the 26 years the franchise was based in Minnesota. The North Stars lost in the playoffs to the Chicago Black Hawks in the second round.

In 1983–84 Bill Mahoney, a defensive-minded coach, took over. Early in the season, Bobby Smith was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for a pair of defense-minded forwards, Keith Acton and Mark Napier. The team posted the second-highest victory total in its history with 39 and won its second Norris Division crown in three years. Luckily for them, the Norris Division was very weak that year; they were the only team in the division to have a winning record.

In the playoffs, the North Stars defeated the Blackhawks. Minnesota won the series 3–2, then eliminated the St. Louis Blues in seven games. They then lost to the Edmonton Oilers in four games.

After 1984, the franchise only had one more winning season in Minnesota, in 1985–86. In 1987–88, it won 19 games, the second-fewest wins in franchise history. A loss to the Calgary Flames coupled with the Leafs&#x27; win over the Red Wings not only kept the North Stars out of the playoffs, but also with the worst record in the league. Chronic attendance problems led the owners to threaten to move the club to the San Francisco Bay Area, against the league&#x27;s wishes.

===1990s===
The NHL instituted a compromise for the 1990–91 season whereby the Gund brothers were awarded an expansion team in the Bay Area, the San Jose Sharks, that would receive players from Minnesota via a dispersal draft with the North Stars. Both the Sharks and North Stars would then be able to select players from the other 20 NHL teams in an expansion draft. A group previously petitioning for an NHL team in the Bay Area, led by Howard Baldwin and Morris Belzberg, bought the North Stars as part of the deal. Baldwin and Belzberg purchased the team from the Gunds for approximately $38.1 million (including $1 million in liabilities as well as giving the Gunds their share of the fees from the next three expansion teams, expected to be $7.14 million). Norman Green, a former part-owner of the Calgary Flames and a last-minute newcomer to Baldwin and Belzberg&#x27;s group, purchased 51% controlling interest in the North Stars from them, with Baldwin and Belzberg sharing the remaining 49% stake. Green agreed to purchase Baldwin&#x27;s 24.5% share, giving him more than 75% control of the team shortly after a dispute with Baldwin arose. Belzberg maintained his share of the rest of the team&#x27;s stock until October 1990, when Green became the team&#x27;s sole owner by buying Belzberg&#x27;s shares.

In the 1990–91 season, despite a losing record in the regular season, the North Stars embarked on a Cinderella run to the Stanley Cup Finals. They knocked off the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues (the top two teams in the NHL during the regular season) in six games each and the defending Stanley Cup champion Edmonton Oilers in five games, making it to the finals for the second time in franchise history. The team fought hard against the eventual champion Pittsburgh Penguins, led by Mario Lemieux. They won two out of the first three contests before being obliterated 8–0 in game six of the best-of-seven series. It was the most lopsided defeat in a deciding game of the Stanley Cup Finals since the original Ottawa Senators defeated the Dawson City Nuggets 23–2 in 1905.

Following the 1991 Finals run, the North Stars adopted a new logo – the word &quot;STARS&quot; in italicized gold capitals over a green star with a gold outline; the gold now a more metallic shade than the previous yellowish shade. The team also adopted black as its primary color for its road uniforms, and eliminated gold from the uniform, except for the logo. Even before the logo change, it had been speculated that the North Stars would adopt a new logo following the 1990–91 season, as the future primary logo was first painted on the Met Center ice before the aforementioned season, albeit in a reverse color scheme from its upcoming incarnation.

To celebrate the team&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the team wore a commemorative patch on the left shoulder of its uniforms. The patch depicted Bill Goldsworthy, wearing a green uniform, facing off against Mike Modano, wearing the new black uniform.

Per the 1991 expansion agreement, the North Stars were allowed to protect fourteen players from selection by the Sharks. This meant the core of their 1991 conference championship roster essentially remained intact, with the team losing only four players from its NHL roster to San Jose (the Sharks&#x27; remaining selections from Minnesota were minor-leaguers). As a result, while the Sharks endured the typical struggles of an expansion team and finished last overall, the North Stars modestly improved from the 1990–91 regular season though still finishing with a losing record. They made the 1992 playoffs and took a 3–2 series lead into game six at the Met Center against the Norris Division champion Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings won, 1–0, in overtime after a video referee review confirmed that Sergei Fedorov had scored a goal. This was the first use of video replay in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Wings won the seventh game at home, 5–2.

===Departure to Dallas===

By 1992, Norman Green was arranging a deal to turn the team into the Los Angeles Stars, playing at a new arena (which is now the Honda Center) under construction in Anaheim, California. However, as The Walt Disney Company was already in negotiations with the NHL to create an expansion team in the area, the league instead asked Green to let Disney create the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim while the North Stars would be allowed to relocate to any city of Green&#x27;s choosing. In January 1993, Green chose Dallas, Texas as the new home of the franchise, and the decision was formally announced on March 10. Several reasons were cited for the relocation, including poor attendance during a string of losing seasons, the failure to reach deals for a new arena in either Minneapolis or Saint Paul, and a sexual harassment lawsuit against Green that resulted in his wife threatening to leave him unless he moved the team. The subsequent decision to relocate the franchise to Texas made Green much reviled in Minnesota, where he derisively came to be known as &quot;Norm Greed&quot;.

Another factor that also precipitated the move to Dallas was the fact that the team refused to play at the Target Center, where the NBA&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves played, due to the fact that Coca-Cola had advertising and pouring rights at that arena. The North Stars and the Met Center had Pepsi as their sponsor. Despite that, the newly relocated Stars did play at Target Center on December 9, 1993, against the Ottawa Senators, though only 14,058 fans showed up to watch the Stars defeat the Senators 6–1.

Due to mounting financial problems resulting from poor management of his non-hockey business ventures, Green only kept the Stars for three more years before selling them to Tom Hicks in 1996.

On the other hand, the Dallas franchise has taken some steps to mend the emotional wounds left in Minnesota. When the Dallas Stars won the 1999 Stanley Cup–three years after Green sold the team–their official video &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; not only included their past seasons&#x27; disappointments, but also paid tribute to the North Stars&#x27; 1991 run to the final, of which star Mike Modano and general manager Bob Gainey had been part.

Modano, who retired in 2011, was the last former North Star in the NHL, leaving the Stars franchise after the season. The last active former North Star was Mike Craig, who played in Italy until 2013. After Modano&#x27;s last game as a Dallas Star, which was in Minnesota playing the Wild, Modano came on the ice as the first star wearing a North Stars jersey, getting a standing ovation from the crowd.

With the departure of former North Stars scout Les Jackson from the Dallas Stars franchise on June 30, 2020, there is no longer anyone working for Dallas who had a direct connection to the franchise&#x27;s time in Minnesota.

===Return of NHL hockey to Minnesota===

NHL hockey returned to Minnesota when the NHL announced in 1997 that the state had been awarded an expansion franchise to begin play in the 2000–01 NHL season. In 1998, the team name for the new franchise became the Minnesota Wild.

On December 17, 2000, the Wild hosted the Dallas Stars in the latter&#x27;s first visit to Minnesota since the relocation (excluding the aforementioned neutral-site game at Target Center in 1993). The Wild won that game 6–0 with Darby Hendrickson scoring two goals and Manny Fernandez making 24 saves for a shutout. As of the 2023–24 season, the Stars won 52 of 90 meetings with the Wild, with one tie and nine overtime/shootout (OT/SO) losses. The two teams also faced each other in the 2016 and 2023 first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, the Stars prevailed over the Wild in both series. 

On April 4, 2017, the Wild honored the North Stars by wearing North Stars jerseys for warmups, despite the North Stars history belonging to the Dallas Stars. Martin Hanzal warmed up with number 91, as the North Stars retired number 19 in honor of Bill Masterton. Zach Parise also warmed up with equipment belonging to his father, the late Jean-Paul Parise, who played for the North Stars.

An alumni game between the Chicago Blackhawks and team Minnesota took place the day prior to the 2016 Stadium Series with team Minnesota winning 6–4. Team Minnesota featured a mix of former North Stars and Wild players, and wore throwback North Stars jerseys with the former&#x27;s logo on the right shoulder and the Wild logo on the left shoulder.

For the 2020–21 season, the Minnesota Wild introduced a version of the 1978 North Stars jersey, featuring a recolored Wild logo as part of the league-wide &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jersey program. In the 2022–23 season, a green version of the &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jersey was used. The Wild&#x27;s green &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; jersey was subsequently promoted to a full-time third jersey as &quot;The 78s&quot; alternate uniform, adding the recolored &quot;State of Hockey&quot; patch on the shoulders.

==Logos and colors==
The North Stars were known for their &quot;classic&quot; green and gold color scheme. For the majority of their existence, the North Stars wore white jerseys with green and gold striping at home and green jerseys with white and gold stripes on the road. Black trim was added to the white jerseys in 1981, and to the green jerseys in 1988. In 1988–89, the pants changed from green to black, with three stars on each side in place of stripes.

In 1991, black became the primary color, as the team underwent a complete redesign. The new logo and uniforms were carried over to Dallas after the team moved south.

==Season-by-season record==
The team had a 758–970–334 regular season record, and a 77–82 playoff record with two Norris Division championships, and one Campbell Conference championship.

==Broadcasting==
WTCN-TV Channel 11 (now KARE) carried North Stars games from 1967 to 1979. Usually, 27 road games and three home games were televised each season. Frank Buetel was the play-by-play announcer from 1967 to 1970. Hal Kelly took over for the next few years, followed by Joe Boyle in the mid-1970s. Boyle was joined by color commentator Roger Buxton. After the station gained NBC affiliation in 1979, telecasts moved to KMSP-TV (now a Fox owned-and-operated station), with most called by Bob Kurtz and retired North Stars defenseman Tom Reid (incidentally, Kurtz and Reid are the Minnesota Wild&#x27;s current radio announce team). KITN (now WFTC) televised North Stars games with Frank Mazzocco on play-by-play with color commentators Fred Barrett, Roger Buxton, and Wally Shaver from the 1984–85 through 1986–87 seasons. The 1987–88 season saw North Stars&#x27; games telecast over Saint Cloud-based UHF station KXLI (with Kurtz on play-by-play and former Islander goalie Glenn &quot;Chico&quot; Resch on color). After Kurtz moved on to Massachusetts-based NESN in the summer of 1988, Doug McLeod joined Resch in the broadcast booth beginning with the 1988–89 season. The North Stars&#x27; telecasts returned to KMSP in December 1988. The majority of the road games continued to be shown on KMSP, though late in the season some road games were shown on the premium channel Midwest Sports Channel. For the 1989–90 season, Tom Reid joined McLeod in the booth, replacing Resch as color commentator. The 1990–91 season saw first Lou Nanne, then Dave Maloney, and then again, for the playoffs, Nanne paired with McLeod for television broadcasts on both of these same channels. Telecasts were almost exclusively of North Stars&#x27; road games, although a handful of home games were televised during that period of time. The 1991 Stanley Cup Finals run saw home games available only on pay-per-view and not available to most hockey fans in Minnesota. Dave Hodge handled TV play-by-play, partnering with color analyst Joe Micheletti in the 1991–92 season.

North Stars radio broadcasts originated from WCCO Radio from 1967 to 1978, then moved to another Twin Cities-based clear-channel station, KSTP, where radio broadcasts stayed until the team moved to Dallas in 1993, save a few seasons on a 5,000-watt radio station, WAYL. Al Shaver was the play-by-play radio announcer throughout the Stars&#x27; stay in Minnesota. During the WCCO era, Shaver was joined for many home games by WCCO&#x27;s Larry Jagoe in the early seasons, followed by WCCO personality Steve Cannon. Shaver&#x27;s partners on KSTP were Russ Small, Ted Robinson, and (during the last three seasons) former Dallas Stars announcer Ralph Strangis. During the Stars&#x27; final season (1992–93), Shaver and Strangis called games on KMSP, while the Stars&#x27; cable TV game announcer, Doug McLeod, called games over KSTP and the Stars&#x27; radio network.

Shaver is a ten-time Minnesota Sportscaster of the Year and, as the 1993 Foster Hewitt Memorial Award-winner, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Following the team&#x27;s departure to Dallas, he called University of Minnesota Golden Gophers hockey games until his retirement in 1996.

It was on the night of the Stars&#x27; final game at Joe Louis Arena versus the Detroit Red Wings that Shaver first shared the broadcast booth with his son, Wally, who is the current Gopher hockey radio announcer. The elder Shaver&#x27;s call of the closing moments of the last-ever North Stars game went thus:
===Radio===

Play-by-play
* Al Shaver, 1967–1992
* Doug McLeod, 1992–1993

Color commentators

* Larry Jagoe, 1967–1971
* Paul Giel, 1971–1972
* Steve Cannon, 1972–1978
* Tom Reid, 1978–1980
* Ted Robinson, 1980–1982
* Russ Small, 1982–1984
* Tom Reid, 1984–1989
* Bill Goldsworthy, 1989–1990
* Ralph Strangis, 1990–1992
* Doug Woog, 1992–1993 (select games)
* Tom Vannelli, 1992–1993 (select games)
* Wally Shaver, 1992–1993 (select games)
Al Shaver did all radio play-by-play except in 1992–93, when he did radio play-by-play on non televised games. He also missed some games when he did the high school hockey tournament in a number of years. Shaver&#x27;s replacements were Bob Kurtz (1979–80), Ted Robinson (1980–81 and 1981–82), Frank Mazzocco (1986–87), Ralph Strangis (1990–91). In 1992–93, Doug McLeod did radio play-by-play on televised games with various analysts including Doug Woog, Tom Vannelli, and Wally Shaver.

Shaver did not follow the North Stars when they moved to Dallas in 1993, opting to stay in the Twin Cities. He called University of Minnesota men&#x27;s hockey for several seasons, then retired in 1996. Shaver came out of retirement for one season in 2000, when the NHL returned to Minnesota with the debut of the Minnesota Wild, calling their games during their inaugural season in 2000–01.

After retiring as a player, Reid spent 12 years as color commentator for the North Stars. After the team&#x27;s move to Dallas, Reid continued as an analyst for NCAA hockey. He and Bob Kurtz have been part of the radio broadcast team for the Minnesota Wild since the team&#x27;s inaugural season in 2000.

Although Strangis had a great deal of broadcast experience, his tryout as color commentator on the Minnesota North Stars radio network was a longshot; other better-known sportscasters received more air time during the auditioning process. The five potential candidates split up a game as guest commentators alongside Al Shaver, then voice of the Minnesota North Stars. The two better-known talents each took a period and then the three longshots split up the third, with Strangis going last. When Al Shaver was asked who he liked the best, he chose Strangis. Ralph shone in his audition, with the perfect ability to complement Shaver&#x27;s play-by-play with insights from the players and his own intimate knowledge of the game. When the Stars moved to Dallas in 1993, Shaver decided to not to migrate south with the franchise and retired. After three more seasons as color commentator (teaming with Mike Fornes), Strangis migrated to the play-by-play mic, effectively cementing his status as the &quot;Voice of the Stars.&quot;

In 1979, Kurtz joined KMSP-TV, where he called Minnesota Twins games from 1979 to 1986 and Minnesota North Stars games from 1979 to 1984. He was also the North Stars play by play announcer on KXLI-TV during the 1987–88 NHL season. From 1988 to 1989, he was the sports director at KSTP radio, where he also called University of Minnesota hockey, football and basketball. Kurtz returned to Minnesota in 2000 when he was hired to become the first radio play by play announcer for the Minnesota Wild. He was reunited with Tom Reid, who he previously worked with while calling games for the North Stars as well as University of Minnesota and Michigan State hockey broadcasts.
