<text>Jaime Royal Robertson (July 5, 1943 – August 9, 2023) was a Canadian musician of Indigenous ancestry. He was lead guitarist for Bob Dylan in the mid-late 1960s and early-mid 1970s, guitarist and primary songwriter of The Band from their inception until 1978, after which he enjoyed a lengthy solo career.

Robertson&#x27;s work with the Band was instrumental in creating the Americana music genre. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame as a member of the Band, and into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame, with the Band and on his own. He is ranked 59th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest guitarists. He wrote &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, and &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; with the Band and had solo hits with &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Down the Crazy River&quot;, and many others. He was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Songwriters.

Robertson collaborated on film and TV soundtracks, usually with director Martin Scorsese, beginning in the rockumentary film &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; (1978) and continuing through dramatic films including &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (1983), &quot;Casino&quot; (1995), &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2013), &quot;Silence&quot; (2016), &quot;The Irishman&quot; (2019), and &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; (2023), scoring the latter shortly before his death. The film was dedicated to his memory, and garnered him a posthumous nomination for Best Original Score at the Academy Awards.

==Early life==
Jaime Royal Robertson was born an only child on July 5, 1943. His mother was born Rosemarie Dolly Chrysler on February 6, 1922. She was Cayuga and Mohawk, raised on the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve southwest of Toronto, near Hamilton. She lived with an aunt in the Cabbagetown neighbourhood of Toronto and worked at the Coro jewellery plating factory. She met James Patrick Robertson there and they married in 1942.

The couple continued working at the factory and the three lived in several Toronto neighbourhoods while Robbie was a child. He often travelled with his mother to the reserve to visit family. Here he was taught guitar, particularly by his older cousin Herb Myke. He became a fan of rock and roll and rhythm and blues through the radio, listening to disc jockey George &quot;Hound Dog&quot; Lorenz play rock on WKBW from Buffalo, New York, and staying up to listen to John R.&#x27;s all-night blues show on WLAC, a clear-channel station in Nashville, Tennessee.

In his teens, Robertson&#x27;s parents separated. His mother told him his biological father was not James, but Alexander David Klegerman, an American Jewish man she met at work. He became a professional gambler and died in a hit-and-run accident on the Queen Elizabeth Way. She had been with him while James was stationed in Newfoundland with the Canadian Army before they married. She arranged for her son to meet his paternal uncles Morris (Morrie) and Nathan (Natie) Klegerman.

==Early career==
When Robertson was 14, he worked two brief summer jobs in the travelling carnival circuit, first for a few days in a suburb of Toronto, and later as an assistant at a freak show for three weeks during the Canadian National Exhibition. He later drew from this for his song &quot;Life is a Carnival&quot; (with the Band) and the movie &quot;Carny&quot; (1980), which he both produced and starred in.

The first band Robertson joined was Little Caesar and the Consuls, formed in 1956 by pianist/vocalist Bruce Morshead and guitarist Gene MacLellan. He stayed with the group for almost a year, playing popular songs of the day at local teen dances. In 1957 he formed Robbie and the Rhythm Chords with his friend Pete &quot;Thumper&quot; Traynor (who later founded Traynor Amplifiers). They changed the name to Robbie and the Robots after they watched the film &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; and took a liking to the film&#x27;s character Robby the Robot. Traynor customized Robertson&#x27;s guitar for the Robots, fitting it with antennae and wires to give it a space age look. Traynor and Robertson joined with pianist Scott Cushnie and became The Suedes. At a Suedes show on October 5, 1959, when they played CHUM Radio&#x27;s Hif Fi Club on Toronto&#x27;s Merton Street, Ronnie Hawkins first became aware of them and was impressed enough to join them for a few numbers.
===With Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks===
Robertson began shadowing Hawkins after the Suedes opened for the Arkansas-based rockabilly group Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks at Dixie Arena. One afternoon he overheard Hawkins say he needed some new songs since they were going into the studio to record the next month. Hoping to ingratiate himself, Robertson stayed up all night and wrote two songs, &quot;Someone Like You&quot; and &quot;Hey Boba Lu&quot;, and played them for Hawkins the next day. The showman was impressed and recorded both of them for his new album, &quot;Mr Dynamo&quot; (1959). Hawkins brought Robertson to the Brill Building in New York City to help him choose songs for the rest of the album.

Hawkins hired pianist Scott Cushnie away from the Suedes, and took him on tour in Arkansas with the Hawks. When the Hawks&#x27; bass player left the group, Cushnie recommended that Hawkins hire Robertson to replace him on bass.

Hawkins invited Robertson to Arkansas, and then flew to the UK to perform on television there. Left in Arkansas, Robertson spent his living allowance on records and practised intensively each day. Upon returning, Hawkins hired him to play bass. Cushnie left the band a few months later. Robertson soon switched from bass to playing lead guitar for the Hawks. Robertson developed into a guitar virtuoso.

Roy Buchanan, a few years older than Robertson, was briefly a member of the Hawks and became an important influence on Robertson&#x27;s guitar style: &quot;Standing next to Buchanan on stage for several months, Robertson was able to absorb Buchanan&#x27;s deft manipulations with his volume speed dial, his tendency to bend multiple strings for steel guitar-like effect, his rapid sweep picking, and his passion for bending past the root and fifth notes during solo flights.&quot;

Drummer/singer Levon Helm was already a member of the Hawks and soon became close friends with Robertson. The Hawks continued to tour the United States and Canada, adding Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson to the Hawks lineup in 1961.

This lineup, which later became the Band, toured with Hawkins throughout 1962 and into 1963. They also hired the saxophone player Jerry Penfound and later Bruce Bruno, who were both with the group in their intermediary period as Levon and the Hawks.

Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks cut sessions for Roulette Records throughout 1961–1963, all of which Robertson appeared on. The sessions included three singles: &quot;Come Love&quot; b/w &quot;I Feel Good&quot; (Roulette 4400 1961); &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; b/w &quot;Bo Diddley&quot; (Roulette 4483 1963); and &quot;There&#x27;s A Screw Loose&quot; b/w &quot;High Blood Pressure&quot; (Roulette 4502 1963).

===With Levon and the Hawks===
The Hawks left Ronnie Hawkins at the beginning of 1964 to go on their own. The members of the Hawks were losing interest in playing in the rockabilly style and favoured blues and soul music. In early 1964, the group approached agent Harold Kudlets about representing them, which he agreed to do, booking them a year&#x27;s worth of shows in the same circuits as they had been in before with Ronnie Hawkins. Originally dubbed &quot;The Levon Helm Sextet&quot;, the group included all of the future members of the Band, plus Jerry Penfound on saxophone and Bob Bruno on vocals.

After Bruno left in May 1964, the group changed their name to Levon and the Hawks. Penfound stayed with the group until 1965. Kudlets kept the group busy performing throughout 1964 and into 1965, finally booking them into two lengthy summer engagements at the popular nightclub Tony Mart&#x27;s in Somers Point, New Jersey, at the Shore. They played six nights a week alongside Conway Twitty and other acts.

The members of Levon and the Hawks befriended blues artist John P. Hammond while he was performing in Toronto in 1964. Later in the year, the group agreed to work on Hammond&#x27;s album &quot;So Many Roads&quot; (released in 1965) at the same time that they were playing the Peppermint Lounge in New York City. Robertson played guitar throughout the album, and was billed &quot;Jaime R. Robertson&quot; in the album&#x27;s credits.

Levon and the Hawks cut a single &quot;Uh Uh Uh&quot; b/w &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; under the name the Canadian Squires in March 1965. Both songs were written by Robertson. The single was recorded in New York and released on Apex Records in the United States and on Ware Records in Canada. As Levon and the Hawks, the group cut an afternoon session for Atco Records later in 1965, which yielded two singles, &quot;The Stones I Throw&quot; b/w &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; (Atco 6383) and &quot;Go, Go, Liza Jane&quot; b/w &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; (Atco 6625). Robertson also wrote all three of the tracks on Levon and the Hawks&#x27; Atco singles.

===With Bob Dylan and the Hawks===
====1965–1966 World Tour====

Toward the end of Levon and the Hawks&#x27; second engagement at Tony Mart&#x27;s in New Jersey, in August 1965, Robertson received a call from Albert Grossman Management requesting a meeting with singer Bob Dylan. The group had been recommended to both Grossman and to Dylan by Mary Martin, one of Grossman&#x27;s employees; she was originally from Toronto and was a friend of the band. Dylan was also aware of the group through his friend John Hammond, whose album &quot;So Many Roads&quot; members of the Hawks had performed on.

Robertson agreed to meet with Dylan. Initially, Dylan intended simply to hire Robertson as the guitarist for his backing group. Robertson refused the offer, but did agree to play two shows with Dylan, one at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Forest Hills, New York on August 28, and one at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on September 3. Robertson suggested they use Levon Helm on drums for the shows.

Robertson and Helm performed in Dylan&#x27;s backing band, along with Harvey Brooks and Al Kooper for both shows. The first at Forest Hills received a predominantly hostile response, but the second in Los Angeles was received slightly more favourably. Dylan flew up to Toronto and rehearsed with Levon and the Hawks September 15–17, as Levon and the Hawks finished an engagement there, and hired the full band for his upcoming tour.

Bob Dylan and the Hawks toured the United States throughout October–December 1965, with each show consisting of two sets: an acoustic show featuring only Dylan on guitar and harmonica, and an electric set featuring Dylan backed by the Hawks. The tours were largely met with a hostile reaction from fans who knew Dylan as a prominent figure in the American folk music revival, and thought his move into rock music a betrayal. Helm left the group after their November 28 performance in Washington, D.C. Session drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Helm for the December dates, and Sandy Konikoff was brought in to replace Gregg in January 1966.

Dylan and the Hawks played more dates in the continental United States from February to March 1966 of Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1966 World Tour. From April 9-May 27, they played Hawaii, Australia, Europe, and the UK and Ireland. Drummer Sandy Konikoff left after the Pacific Northwest dates in March, and Mickey Jones replaced him, staying with the group for the remainder of the tour. The Australian and European legs of the tour received a particularly harsh response from disgruntled folk fans. The May 17 Manchester Free Trade Hall show is best known for an angry audience member audibly yelling &quot;Judas!&quot; at Dylan; it became a frequently-bootlegged live show from the tour, but was eventually released officially as &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The &quot;Royal Albert Hall&quot; Concert&quot;.

The European leg of the tour was filmed by documentary filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, but completion of a planned film was delayed. After recovering from an accident, Dylan decided to edit it himself. ABC television rejected it, and it was never commercially released. It was screened as &quot;Eat the Document&quot; in 1972 at the Whitney Museum in New York.

On November 30, 1965, Dylan cut a studio session with members of the Hawks, which yielded the non-LP single &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot; Dylan completed the &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; album in Nashville in mid-February 1966, employing Robertson for one of these sessions, which took place on February 14.

====&quot;Basement Tapes&quot; period====
On July 29, 1966, Dylan sustained an injured neck from a motorcycle accident, and retreated to a quiet domestic life with his new wife and child in upstate New York. Some of the members of the Hawks were living at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City at the time, and were kept on a weekly retainer by Dylan&#x27;s management.

In February 1967, Dylan invited the members of the Hawks to come up to Woodstock, New York to work on music. Robertson had met a French-Canadian woman on the Paris stop of Dylan&#x27;s 1966 world tour, and the two moved into a house in the Woodstock area. The remaining three members of the Hawks rented a house near West Saugerties, New York; it was later dubbed &quot;Big Pink&quot; because of its pink exterior.

Dylan and the members of the Hawks worked together at the Big Pink house every day to rehearse and generate ideas for new songs, many of which they recorded in Big Pink&#x27;s makeshift basement studio. The recordings were made between the late spring and autumn of 1967. Previous Hawks member Levon Helm returned to the group in August 1967. By this time, Robertson&#x27;s guitar style had evolved to be more supportive of the songs and less devoted to displaying speed and virtuosity.

In time, word about these sessions began to circulate, and in 1968, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine co-founder Jann Wenner brought attention to these tracks in an article entitled &quot;Dylan&#x27;s Basement Tape Should Be Released&quot;.

In 1969, a bootleg album with a plain white cover compiled by two incognito music industry insiders featured a collection of seven tracks from these sessions. The album, which became known as &quot;The Great White Wonder&quot;, began to appear in independent record stores and receive radio airplay. This album became a runaway success and helped to launch the bootleg recording industry.

In 1975, Robertson produced an official compilation, &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, which included a selection of tracks from the sessions. An exhaustive collection of all 138 extant recordings was released in 2014 as &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete&quot;.

===With The Band===
====1967–1968: &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot;====

In late 1967, Dylan left to record his next album, &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; (1967). After recording the basic tracks, Dylan asked Robertson and Garth Hudson about playing on the album to fill out the sound. Robertson liked the starkness of the sound and recommended Dylan leave the tracks as they were. Dylan worked with the Hawks again when they were his backup band for two Woody Guthrie memorial concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York City in January 1968. Three of these performances were later released by Columbia Records on the LP &quot;A Tribute to Woody Guthrie, Vol. 1&quot; (1972).

Over the course of the &quot;Basement Tapes&quot; period, the group had developed a sound of their own, and Grossman went to Los Angeles to shop the group to a major label, securing a contract with Capitol Records. The group went to New York to begin recording songs with music producer John Simon. Capitol brought the group to Los Angeles to finish the album. The resulting album, &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot;, was released in August 1968.

Robertson wrote four of the songs on &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot;, including &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;Chest Fever&quot;, &quot;Caledonia Mission&quot;, and &quot;To Kingdom Come&quot;. He is listed in the songwriting credits as &quot;J.R. Robertson&quot;. He sang lead vocal on the track &quot;To Kingdom Come&quot;; he did not sing on another Band song released to the public until &quot;Knockin&#x27; Lost John&quot; on 1977&#x27;s &quot;Islands&quot;. Two of Robertson&#x27;s compositions for the album, &quot;The Weight&quot; and &quot;Chest Fever&quot;, became important touchstones in the group&#x27;s career. &quot;The Weight&quot; was influenced by the films of director Luis Buñuel, in particular &quot;Nazarín&quot; (1959) and &quot;Viridiana&quot; (1961), and reflects the recurring theme in Buñuel&#x27;s films about the impossibility of sainthood. The song portrays an individual who attempts to take a saintly pilgrimage, and becomes mired down with requests from other people to do favors for them along the way. The mention of &quot;Nazareth&quot; at the beginning of the song refers to Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where the C. F. Martin &amp; Company guitar manufacturer is located; it was inspired by Robertson seeing the word &quot;Nazareth&quot; in the hole of his Martin guitar. Although &quot;The Weight&quot; reached No. 21 on the British radio charts, it did not fare as well on the American charts, initially stalling at No. 63.

The song gained traction following more successful covers by Jackie DeShannon (US No. 55, 1968), Aretha Franklin (US No. 19, 1969), and the Supremes with the Temptations (US No. 46, 1969), and the song&#x27;s inclusion in the movie &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), which became a runaway success. &quot;The Weight&quot; has since become the Band&#x27;s best known song. It has been covered by many artists, appeared in dozens of films and documentaries, and has become a staple of American rock music.

When &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; was released in 1968, the Band initially avoided media attention, and discouraged Capitol Records from promotional efforts. They also did not immediately pursue touring to support the album, and declined to be interviewed for a year. The resulting mystery surrounding the group prompted speculation in the underground press. &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; received excellent reviews, and the album influenced many well-known musicians of the period.

====1969–1973: Expansion and acclaim ====

In early 1969, the Band rented a home from Sammy Davis Jr. in Hollywood Hills, and converted the pool house behind it into a studio to recreate the &quot;clubhouse&quot; atmosphere that they had previously enjoyed at Big Pink. The band began recording every day in the pool house studio, working on a tight schedule to complete the album. An additional three tracks were recorded at The Hit Factory in New York in April 1969. Robertson did most of the audio engineering on the album.

The Band began performing regularly in spring 1969, with their first live dates as the Band taking place at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Their most notable performances that year were at the 1969 Woodstock Festival and the UK Isle of Wight Festival with Bob Dylan in August.

The Band&#x27;s album &quot;The Band&quot; was released in September 1969, and became a critical and commercial success. The album received almost universal critical praise, peaked at No. 9 on the U.S. pop charts, and stayed on the Top 40 for 24 weeks. &quot;The Band&quot; works as a loose concept album of Americana themes, and was instrumental in the creation of the Americana music genre. It was included in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry in 2009. The song from this album that had the strongest cultural influence was &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;. The song explores a Confederate man&#x27;s life after defeat of the South following the American Civil War. It incorporates historical events to create a larger American mythos. Although the Band&#x27;s original version was only released as the B side of the single &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;, a cover version by Joan Baez went to No. 3 on the charts in 1971 and helped to popularize the song.

Several other tracks from &quot;The Band&quot; received significant radio airplay, and became staples in the group&#x27;s concert appearances. &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot; peaked at No. 25 in late 1969 in the United States, and was their only Top 30 hit there. &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; reached No. 16 in the UK in April 1970, the highest chart position of any single by the group in that country. &quot;Whispering Pines&quot;, co-written by Richard Manuel, was released as a single in France in 1970, and was later the title of a 2009 book about Canadian contributions to the Americana music genre by Jason Schneider. On November 2, 1969, the Band appeared on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, one of only two television appearances they made.

On January 12, 1970, the Band was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. This was the first time a North American rock band had been featured on the cover of the magazine. The Band rented The Woodstock Playhouse in Woodstock, New York with the intent of recording a new live album there, but the city council voted against it, so they recorded on location, but without an audience. Robertson handled most of the songwriting duties as before. Robertson brought in Todd Rundgren to engineer the album which was recorded in two weeks&#x27; time. These sessions became their third album, &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, which became the Band&#x27;s highest-charting album, peaking at No. 5 on September 5 and staying on the Billboard Top 40 for 14 weeks.
The Band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Cahoots&quot;, was recorded at Albert Grossman&#x27;s newly built Bearsville Studios and was released in October 1971. The album received mixed reviews, and peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard charts, only remaining on the Billboard Top 40 for five weeks. &quot;Cahoots&quot; is notable for its cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot;, as well as for featuring the concert favourite &quot;Life Is a Carnival&quot;. The inclusion of &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; came about when Dylan stopped by Robertson&#x27;s home during the recording of &quot;Cahoots&quot; and Robertson asked if he might have any songs to contribute. That led to Dylan playing an unfinished version of &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; for him. Dylan soon completed the song and the Band recorded it for the album. &quot;Life Is a Carnival&quot; features horn parts written by producer and arranger Allen Toussaint. It was the only track from &quot;Cahoots&quot; the Band kept in their set list through to &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; concert and film.

The Band continued to tour throughout 1970–71. A live album recorded at a series of shows at the Academy of Music in New York City between December 28–31, 1971, was released in 1972 as the double album &quot;Rock Of Ages&quot;. &quot;Rock of Ages&quot; peaked at No. 6, and remained in the Top 40 for 14 weeks.

After the Academy of Music shows, the Band again retreated from performing live. They returned to the stage on July 28, 1973, to play the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen alongside the Allman Brothers Band and the Grateful Dead. A recording of the Band&#x27;s performance was released by Capitol Records as the album &quot;Live at Watkins Glen&quot; in 1995. With over 600,000 people in attendance, the festival set a record for &quot;Pop Festival Attendance&quot; in the Guinness Book of World Records. The record was first published in the 1976 edition of the book. In October 1973, the Band released an album of cover songs entitled &quot;Moondog Matinee&quot;, which peaked at No. 28 on the Billboard charts. Around the time of the recording of &quot;Moondog Matinee&quot;, Robertson began working on an ambitious project entitled &quot;Works&quot; that was never finished or released. One lyric from the &quot;Works&quot; project, &quot;Lay a flower in the snow&quot;, was used in Robertson&#x27;s song &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, which appeared on his 1987 self-titled solo album.

====1974: Reunion with Bob Dylan ====
In February 1973, Bob Dylan relocated from Woodstock, New York to Malibu, California. Coincidentally, Robertson moved to Malibu in the summer of 1973, and by October of the year the rest of the members of the Band had followed suit, moving into properties near Zuma Beach.

David Geffen had signed Dylan to Asylum Records, and worked with promoter Bill Graham on the concept that became the Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour. It was his first tour in over seven years.

Meanwhile, Bill Graham took out a full-page advertisement for the Bob Dylan and the Band tour in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The response was one of the largest in entertainment history up to that point, with between 5 and 6 million requests for tickets mailed in for 650,000 seats. Graham&#x27;s office ended up selling tickets off on a lottery basis, and Dylan and the Band netted $2 million from the deal.

Among the rehearsals and preparations, the Band went into the studio with Bob Dylan to record a new album for Asylum Records, &quot;Planet Waves&quot; (1974). Sessions took place at Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California, from November 2–14, 1973. &quot;Planet Waves&quot; was released on February 9, 1974. The album was No. 1 on the Billboard album charts for four weeks, and spent 12 weeks total in the Billboard Top 40. &quot;Planet Waves&quot; was Bob Dylan&#x27;s first No. 1 album, and the first and only time Bob Dylan and the Band recorded a studio album together.

The 1974 tour began at the Chicago Stadium on January 3, 1974, and ended at The Forum in Inglewood, California on February 14. The shows began with more songs from the new &quot;Planet Waves&quot; album and with covers that Dylan and the Band liked, but as the tour went on, they moved toward playing older and more familiar material, only keeping &quot;Forever Young&quot; from the &quot;Planet Waves&quot; album in the set list. Dylan and the Band played a number of tracks from the controversial 1965–1966 World Tour, this time to wildly enthusiastic response from the audience where there had been mixed reaction and boos nine years previously.

The final three shows of the tour at The Forum in Inglewood, California were recorded and assembled into the double album &quot;Before the Flood&quot;. Credited to &quot;Bob Dylan/The Band&quot;, &quot;Before the Flood&quot; was released by Asylum Records on July 20, 1974. The album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard charts, and spent ten weeks in the Top Forty.

====1974–1975: Shangri-La Studios ====
Following the 1974 reunion tour with Bob Dylan, rock manager Elliot Roberts booked the Band with the recently reunited Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. On September 4, both artists played Wembley Stadium in London, appearing with Jesse Colin Young and Joni Mitchell.

After moving to Malibu in 1973, Robertson and the Band had discovered a ranch in Malibu near Zuma Beach called &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, and decided to lease the property. The main house on the property had originally been built by &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937) actress Margo Albert, and the ranch had been the filming and stabling site for the &quot;Mister Ed&quot; television show in the 1960s. In the interim, the house had served as a high-class bordello.

The album release of &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, credited to Bob Dylan and the Band, was the first album production that took place in the new studio. The album, produced by Robertson, featured a selection of tapes from the original 1967 Basement Tapes sessions with Dylan, as well as demos for tracks eventually recorded for the &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot; album. Robertson cleaned up the tracks, and the album was released in July 1975.

Shangri-La Studios proved to be a return to a clubhouse atmosphere that the Band had enjoyed previously at Big Pink, and in the spring of 1975, the group began work on &quot;Northern Lights – Southern Cross&quot;, their first release of original material in four years. One of the best known tracks on the album is &quot;Acadian Driftwood&quot;, the first song with specifically Canadian subject material. Robertson was inspired to write &quot;Acadian Driftwood&quot; after seeing the documentary &quot;L&#x27;Acadie, l&#x27;Acadie&quot; (1971) on Canadian television while in Montreal. Two other notable tracks from that album are &quot;It Makes No Difference&quot; and &quot;Ophelia&quot;.

&quot;Northern Lights – Southern Cross&quot; was released on November 1, 1975. The album received generally positive reviews, and reached No. 26 on the Billboard charts, remaining on the Top 40 for five weeks.

====1976–1978: &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; ====
The Band began touring again in June 1976, performing throughout the summer. The members of the Band were splintering off to work on other projects, with Levon Helm building a studio in Woodstock and Rick Danko having been contracted to Arista Records as a solo artist. While on the summer tour, member Richard Manuel severely injured his neck in a boating accident, so ten dates were cancelled. During this time, Robertson suggested the Band cease to tour. He said they agreed on a &quot;grand finale&quot; show, part ways to work on their various projects, then regroup. Helm later made the case in his autobiography, &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, that Robertson had forced the Band&#x27;s breakup on the rest of the group.

Concert promoter Bill Graham booked the Band at the Winterland Ballroom on American Thanksgiving, November 25, 1976. &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; was a gala event, with ticket prices of $25 per person. It included a Thanksgiving dinner served to the audience, and featured the Band performing with various musical guests. The onstage guest list included Ronnie Hawkins, Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Dr. John, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Van Morrison, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Emmylou Harris, and others.

Robertson wanted to document the event on film, and approached director Martin Scorsese to see if he was interested in shooting the concert. They developed a 200-page script for the show, listing out in columns the lyrics of the songs, who was singing what part, and what instruments were being featured. It included columns for the camera and lighting work.

Scorsese brought in all-star cameramen such as Michael Chapman, László Kovács, and Vilmos Zsigmond to film the show in 35mm. John Simon, producer on the Band&#x27;s first two albums, was brought in to coordinate rehearsals and work as musical director. Boris Leven was brought in as art director. Jonathan Taplin assumed the role of executive producer, and Robertson worked as producer of the film. Rehearsals for &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; concert began in early November. Warner Bros. Records president Mo Ostin offered to fund its filming in exchange for the right to release its music on an album. The Band were contractually obligated to supply Capitol Records with one more album before they could be released to work with Warner Bros. So in between rehearsing, they worked on the studio album &quot;Islands&quot; for Capitol. Robertson wrote or co-wrote eight of the ten tracks. One of the songs, &quot;Knockin&#x27; Lost John&quot;, features Robertson on vocals, and was the first Band song Robertson had sung on since &quot;To Kingdom Come&quot; from &quot;Music From Big Pink&quot;. &quot;Christmas Must Be Tonight&quot; was inspired by the birth of Robertson&#x27;s son, Sebastian, in July 1974.

Approximately 5,000 people attended the concert. The event began at 5 pm, beginning with the audience members being served a full traditional Thanksgiving meal at candlelit tables, with a vegetarian table serving an alternate menu as an option. The Berkeley Promenade Orchestra played waltz music for dancing afterward. The tables were cleared and moved at 8 pm. At 9 pm, the Band played songs for an hour, beginning with &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot;. Just after 10 pm, Robertson introduced Ronnie Hawkins, the first onstage guest, with a succession of guest stars appearing with the group until just after midnight.

The group took a 30-minute break, during which several Bay Area poets, including Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Diane di Prima, and Michael McClure performed readings of their poems. After the break, the Band returned to the stage, performing, among other songs, a new composition entitled &quot;The Last Waltz Theme&quot; that Robertson had just completed less than 48 hours prior. Bob Dylan was brought in at the end of this second set, performing several songs, and finally being joined with the other guest stars for a finale performance of &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;. This was then followed with two all-star jam sessions, after which the Band returned to the stage to close the show with one more song, their rendition of &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t You Do It&quot;.

After &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; concert event was finished, director Martin Scorsese had 400 reels of raw footage to work with, and began editing the footage. The film was then sold to United Artists. In the meantime, Robertson and Scorsese continued to brainstorm more ideas for the film. In April 1977, country singer Emmylou Harris and gospel vocal group the Staple Singers were filmed on a sound stage at MGM performing with the Band. Emmylou Harris performed on &quot;Evangeline&quot;, a new song written by Robertson, and the Staples Singers performed on a new recording of &quot;The Weight&quot;, which they already recorded in 1968. Scorsese&#x27;s next idea was to intersperse the concert footage with interviews of the Band that told their story. Scorsese conducted the interviews. &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; album was released by Warner Brothers Records on April 7, 1978, as a 3-LP set. The first five sides feature live performances from the concert, and the last side contains studio recordings from the MGM sound stage sessions, including &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, which would be released as a single and which is the third and last Band song on which Robbie sings lead. The album peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard charts, and remained in the Top 40 for 8 weeks.

&quot;The Last Waltz&quot; was released to movie theatres on April 26, 1978. The film fared well with both rock and film critics. Robertson and Scorsese made appearances throughout America and Europe to promote the film. Over time, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; has become lauded by many as an important and pioneering rockumentary. Its influence has been felt on subsequent rock music films such as Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; (1984), and U2&#x27;s &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; (1988).

In his mixed review Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;In &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, we have musicians who seem to have bad memories. Who are hanging on. Scorsese&#x27;s direction is mostly limited to closeups and medium shots of performances; he ignores the audience. The movie was made at the end of a difficult period in his own life, and at a particularly hard time (the filming coincided with his work on &quot;New York, New York&quot;). This is not a record of serene men, filled with nostalgia, happy to be among friends.&quot;

=== Work outside of the Band (1970–1977)===

Robertson produced Jesse Winchester&#x27;s debut self-titled album, which was released in 1970 on Ampex Records. The album features Robertson playing guitar throughout the album, and co-credits the track &quot;Snow&quot; to Robertson as well.

Robertson played guitar on ex-Beatle Ringo Starr&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Ringo&quot; (1973), performing with four-fifths of the Band on the track &quot;Sunshine Life For Me (Sail Away Raymond)&quot;. Robertson contributed a guitar solo on the track &quot;Snookeroo&quot; on Starr&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot; (1974).

Robertson played guitar for Joni Mitchell on the track &quot;Raised on Robbery&quot;, which was released on her album &quot;Court and Spark&quot;. In 1974, Robertson also played guitar on Carly Simon&#x27;s version of &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, which featured Simon singing with her then-husband James Taylor.

In 1975, Robertson produced and played guitar on singer/guitarist Hirth Martinez&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hirth From Earth&quot;. Bob Dylan had heard Martinez, and recommended him to Robertson. Robertson identified strongly with Martinez&#x27; music, helped him to secure a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, and agreed to produce Martinez&#x27; debut album. He also played guitar on Martinez&#x27; follow-up album, &quot;Big Bright Street&quot; (1977).

In 1975, Eric Clapton recorded the album &quot;No Reason to Cry&quot; at the Band&#x27;s Shangri-La Studios with help from members of the Band. Robertson played lead guitar on the track &quot;Sign Language&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, Robertson connected with singer Neil Diamond, and the two began collaborating on a concept album about the life and struggles of a Tin Pan Alley songwriter. The resulting album, entitled &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot;, was recorded at Shangri-La Studios in early 1976. It reached No. 6 on the Billboard charts and remained in the Top 40 for sixteen weeks. Robertson produced the album, co-wrote the track &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; with Diamond, and played guitar on &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Lady-Oh&quot;, and &quot;Jungletime&quot;. He produced Diamond&#x27;s live double album &quot;Love at the Greek&quot; (1977), which was recorded in 1976 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. &quot;Love at the Greek&quot; reached No. 8 on the Billboard charts and remained in the Top 40 for nine weeks.

In 1977, Robertson contributed to two album projects from the Band alumni. Robertson played guitar on &quot;Java Blues&quot; on Rick Danko&#x27;s self-titled debut album, and also played guitar on the Earl King-penned &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; on the album &quot;Levon Helm &amp; the RCO All-Stars&quot;.

Also in 1977, Robertson contributed to the second self-titled album by singer-songwriter Libby Titus, who was the former girlfriend of Levon Helm. Robertson produced the track &quot;The Night You Took Me To Barbados In My Dreams&quot; (co-written by Titus and Hirth Martinez), and produced and played guitar on the Cole Porter standard &quot;Miss Otis Regrets&quot;.

==Film career (1980–2023)==
===&quot;Carny&quot;===
After the release of &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, MGM/UA, who released the film, viewed Robertson as a potential film actor, and provided Robertson with an office on the MGM lot. During this time, Martin Scorsese&#x27;s agent, Harry Ulfand, contacted Robertson about the idea of producing a dramatic film about traveling carnivals, which Robertson was drawn to because of his childhood experiences working in carnivals. The screenplay for the film &quot;Carny&quot; was directed by documentary filmmaker Robert Kaylor.

Although Robertson was initially only intended to be the producer of &quot;Carny&quot;, he ended up becoming the third lead actor in the film, playing the role of Patch, the patch man. Gary Busey played &quot;Frankie&quot;, the carnival bozo and Patch&#x27;s best friend. Jodie Foster was selected to play the role of Donna, a small town girl who runs away to join the carnival and threatens to come between the two friends. The film cast real life carnies alongside professional film actors, which created a difficult atmosphere on set. &quot;Carny&quot; opened to theaters on June 13, 1980. Also in 1980, Warner Bros released a soundtrack album for &quot;Carny&quot;, which is co-credited to Robertson and composer Alex North, who wrote the orchestral score for the film. The soundtrack was re-released on compact disc by Real Gone Music in 2015.

===Collaborations with Martin Scorsese===

After the production of &quot;Carny&quot; was completed, Robertson flew to New York to assist Martin Scorsese on the music for the film &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980). Robertson and Scorsese would go on to have a long working relationship. The former found or created music to underscore the latter&#x27;s films. &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was the first, and Robertson credited his work on it for sparking his interest in sourcing and underscoring film music. Robertson supplied three newly recorded instrumental jazz tracks for sourced music, which he also produced. These three tracks feature Robertson playing guitar, along with performances from the Band alumni Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel. One of the tracks, &quot;Webster Hall&quot;, is co-written by Robertson and Garth Hudson. Robertson also worked with Scorsese on selecting the film&#x27;s opening theme music, choosing the intermezzo from &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; by Italian opera composer Pietro Mascagni. The soundtrack was finally released by Capitol Records in 2005 as a 37 track, 2-CD set.

Robertson worked with Scorsese again on his next film, &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (1983), and is credited in the film&#x27;s opening credits for &quot;Music Production&quot;. Robertson contributed one original song, &quot;Between Trains&quot;, to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The song was written in tribute to &quot;Cowboy&quot; Dan Johnson, an assistant of Scorsese&#x27;s who had recently died. Robertson produced the track, sang lead vocals, and played guitar and keyboards; the Band alumni Garth Hudson and Richard Manuel appeared on the track as well. A soundtrack album for the film was released by Warner Bros. in 1983.

In June 1986, Robertson began working with Scorsese on his next film &quot;The Color of Money.&quot; In addition to sourcing music for the film, Robertson also composed the film&#x27;s score; it was the first time Robertson had ever written a dramatic underscore for a film. Robertson brought in Canadian jazz composer Gil Evans to orchestrate the arrangements. The best known song on &quot;The Color of Money&quot; soundtrack is Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s in the Way That You Use It&quot;, which was co-written by Robertson. &quot;It&#x27;s in the Way That You Use It&quot; reached No. 1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart in January 1987. Robertson produced a song for the film with blues player Willie Dixon entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Me Nothin&#x27;&quot;; Dixon&#x27;s track was co-written with Robertson. &quot;The Color of Money&quot;&#x27;s soundtrack album was released by MCA Records.

Robertson worked on Scorsese&#x27;s films &quot;Casino&quot; and &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, and he provided music supervision for &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;, and &quot;Silence&quot;. He scored 2019&#x27;s &quot;The Irishman&quot; and consulted with music supervisor Randall Poster on the entire soundtrack. He scored Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot; shortly before his death. The film is dedicated to Robertson. He received a posthumous Academy Award nomination for his work on the film.

==Solo career==
===Geffen Records period (1987–1991) ===
&quot;Robbie Robertson&quot; (1987)

Robertson began work on his first solo album, &quot;Robbie Robertson&quot;, in July 1986 after signing to Geffen Records. Robertson chose fellow Canadian Daniel Lanois to produce the album. Much of the album was recorded at The Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California. He recorded at Bearsville Studios near Woodstock, New York, and also in Dublin, Ireland, with U2, and in Bath, England, with Peter Gabriel. He employed a number of guest artists on the album, including U2, Gabriel, the Bodeans, and Maria McKee. Garth Hudson and Rick Danko also made appearances on the album. Robertson wrote one track, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, in honor of Richard Manuel, after his death in March 1986. Released on October 26, 1987, &quot;Robbie Robertson&quot; peaked at No. 35 on the Billboard 200, remaining on the top 40 for three weeks. The album charted even higher in the UK, peaking at No. 23 on the UK Albums Chart and remaining on the chart for 14 weeks. &quot;Robbie Robertson&quot; received overwhelming critical acclaim at the time of its release, being listed in the Top-Ten Albums of the Year by several critics in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1987 &quot;The Critics&#x27; Choice&quot; end of the year feature. The album was No. 77 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 1989 list, &quot;100 Best Albums of the Eighties&quot;.

Robertson had his single largest hit in the UK with &quot;Somewhere Down the Crazy River&quot;, which features his spoken word verses contrasted with singing in the choruses. The song reached No. 15 in the UK Hit Singles chart, and remained in the chart for 11 weeks. The video for &quot;Somewhere Down The Crazy River&quot; was directed by Martin Scorsese, and features Maria McKee in an acting role. In the U.S., &quot;Robbie Robertson&quot; produced several hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts, with &quot;Showdown At Big Sky&quot; coming in the highest (#2) and &quot;Sweet Fire Of Love&quot; the second highest (#7). The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Rock / Vocal Album&quot;, and was certified gold in the United States in 1991. In Canada, Robertson won Album of the Year, Best Male Vocalist of the Year, and Producer of the Year at the Juno Award ceremony in 1989. In 1991, Rod Stewart recorded a version of &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; for his album &quot;Vagabond Heart&quot;. Stewart&#x27;s version of the song reached No. 20 on the Billboard 100 chart in the United States and No. 2 on the Billboard Top Canadian Hit Singles chart in Canada. &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; was also performed live by the Grateful Dead with Phil Lesh on vocals.

&quot;Storyville&quot; (1991) 

&quot;Storyville&quot; was released on September 30, 1991. Robertson headed to New Orleans to collaborate with some of the city&#x27;s natives like Aaron and Ivan Neville and the Rebirth Brass Band. Once again, Robertson brought in Band alumni Garth Hudson and Rick Danko as contributors. The album reached No. 69 on the Billboard 200 chart. &quot;Storyville&quot; received numerous positive reviews, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; giving it 4 1/2 stars out of 5, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; awarding it 3 stars out of 4. Two tracks from the album, &quot;What About Now&quot; and &quot;Go Back To Your Woods&quot;, charted on the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts at No. 15 and No. 32 respectively. The album was nominated for Grammy Awards in the categories &quot;Best Rock Vocal Performance (solo)&quot; and &quot;Best Engineer&quot;.

===Production and session work (1984–1992)===
Robertson co-produced the track &quot;The Best of Everything&quot;, which was originally intended for the film &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; but instead was included on the Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers album &quot;Southern Accents&quot;. Robertson also worked on the horn arrangements for the track, and brought in Band alumni Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson as guests.

In 1986, Robertson appeared as a guest on the album &quot;Reconciled&quot; by the Call, playing guitar on the track &quot;The Morning&quot;.

Also in 1986, Robertson was brought on as creative consultant for &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1987), a feature film saluting Chuck Berry. Robertson appears on camera, interviewing Chuck Berry, and then playing guitar while Berry recites poetry.

In 1988, Robertson collaborated as a songwriter with Lone Justice lead singer Maria McKee. One of the songs they co-wrote, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot;, was released on McKee&#x27;s self-titled debut album in 1989.

In 1989, Robertson recorded and produced a new version of the Band&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Must Be Tonight&quot; for the &quot;Scrooged&quot; soundtrack. In 1990, Robertson appeared as a guest on the Ryuichi Sakamoto album &quot;Beauty&quot;, playing guitar on the song &quot;Romance&quot;. He also contributed to the world music video and album production &quot;One World One Voice&quot;.

In 1992, Robertson produced the song &quot;Love in Time&quot; for Roy Orbison&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;King of Hearts&quot;. &quot;Love In Time&quot; was a basic demo Orbison had recorded that was believed to be lost, but had just recently been rediscovered. Robertson set about augmenting Orbison&#x27;s basic vocal track with new arrangements and instrumentation, with the intent of making it sound like the arrangements were there from the beginning instead of later additions.

=== Later solo albums (1994–2019) ===
&quot;Music for the Native Americans&quot; (1994) 

In 1994, Robertson returned to his roots, forming a First Nations group called the Red Road Ensemble for &quot;Music for the Native Americans&quot;, a collection of songs that accompanied a television documentary series produced by TBS. Like his songs, &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; and &quot;Acadian Driftwood&quot;, he touched on history that connects to his life and family. The Battle of Wounded Knee and the near-extinction of the bison are outlined in the song &quot;Ghost Dance&quot;. He won a Juno Award for Producer of the Year. The international success of &quot;Mahk Jchi (Heartbeat Drum Song)&quot; inspired a concert in Agrigento, Italy. He headlined the festival of Indigenous musicians and portions appeared in a PBS documentary.

C&quot;ontact from the Underworld of Redboy&quot; (1998) 
On &quot;Contact from the Underworld of Redboy&quot;, Robertson departed from his typical production style and delved deep into a mix of rock, native, and electronic music. He employed the services of Howie B, DJ Premier, and producer Marius de Vries (Björk, Massive Attack). Through the songs on the album, he took a close look at native traditions like Peyote healing of the Native American Church. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;The Sound Is Fading&quot;, samples a recording of a young Native American singer from the 1940s that Robertson got from the Library Of Congress, and the song &quot;Sacrifice&quot; includes parts of an interview from prison with Leonard Peltier set to a soundscape produced by Robertson and de Vries. The racial epithet in the album&#x27;s title comes from an experience Robertson had where some bullies referred to him as &quot;Red Boy&quot; while he was playing with his cousins. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, and Robertson received a Juno Award for Best Music of Aboriginal Canada Recording.

&quot;How to Become Clairvoyant&quot; (2011) 

Released on April 5, 2011, &quot;How to Become Clairvoyant&quot; was Robertson&#x27;s fifth solo release. It arose from impromptu demo sessions in Los Angeles with Eric Clapton and features him, Steve Winwood, Trent Reznor, Tom Morello, Robert Randolph, Rocco Deluca, Angela McCluskey, and Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes. Robertson performed &quot;He Don&#x27;t Live Here No More&quot; on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, then &quot;Straight Down The Line&quot; with Robert Randolph and the Roots on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. &quot;How to Become Clairvoyant&quot; was also released as a deluxe edition containing five bonus tracks (four demos and the exclusive track &quot;Houdini&quot;, named after the magician Harry Houdini). It debuted at No. 13 on the Billboard 200, marking the highest debut and highest chart position for his solo work. He teamed with painter and photographer Richard Prince to produce a limited collector&#x27;s edition. The 2,500 LP-sized boxes came with an art book, a numbered set of five lithographs (including pieces by Prince and photographer Anton Corbijn), a set of original tarot cards, the original tracks, and ten bonuses.

&quot;Sinematic&quot; (2019) 

Released on September 20, 2019, &quot;Sinematic&quot; was Robertson&#x27;s sixth solo album. It features Van Morrison joining Robertson as dueling hitmen on the track &quot;I Hear You Paint Houses&quot;, as well as other allusions to the world of Scorsese&#x27;s films. Citizen Cope, Derek Trucks, and Frédéric Yonnet make guest appearances on the album.

==Other work==
In Rome, he headlined the 1995 annual Labour Day concert festival with supporting acts Andrea Bocelli, Elvis Costello, and Radiohead.

In 1996, as executive soundtrack producer, Robertson heard a demo of &quot;Change the World&quot; and sent it to Clapton as a suggestion for the soundtrack of &quot;Phenomenon&quot;, starring John Travolta. Babyface produced the track. &quot;Change the World&quot; won 1997 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Record of the Year. In 1999, Robertson contributed songs to Oliver Stone&#x27;s film, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;.

In 2000, David Geffen and Mo Ostin convinced Robertson to join DreamWorks Records as a creative executive. Robertson, who persuaded Nelly Furtado to sign with the company, was actively involved with film projects and developing new artist talent, including signings of A.i., Boomkat, eastmountainsouth, and Dana Glover. On February 9, 2002, Robertson performed &quot;Stomp Dance (Unity)&quot; as part of the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2004, he contributed the song &quot;Shine Your Light&quot; to the &quot;Ladder 49&quot; soundtrack.

In 2005, Robertson was executive producer of the definitive box set for the Band, entitled &quot;A Musical History&quot;. In 2006, he recorded with Jerry Lee Lewis on the track &quot;Twilight&quot;, a Robertson composition, for Lewis&#x27; album &quot;Last Man Standing&quot;. On July 28, 2007, at Eric Clapton&#x27;s Crossroads Guitar Festival in Bridgeview, Illinois, Robertson made a rare live appearance. Also in 2007, Robertson accepted an invitation to participate in &quot;Goin&#x27; Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino&quot; (Vanguard). With the group Galactic, Robertson contributed a version of Domino&#x27;s &quot;Goin&#x27; to the River&quot;.

In November 2024, Robertson postumously appeared in the documentary &quot;Return of the King: The Fall and Rise of Elvis Presley&quot;.

==Personal life==
On March 24, 1968, Robertson married Dominique Bourgeois, a Canadian journalist. Dominique filed for divorce in 1977 during a brief separation, but the divorce was never finalized and they remained married until 2003. They had three children: two daughters, and son Sebastian.

Robertson married his girlfriend of four years, Canadian entrepreneur, restaurateur, and &quot;Top Chef Canada&quot; judge Janet Zuccarini, on March 12, 2023, which was shared on her Instagram account.

Robertson was a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

===Death and tributes===
Robertson died in Los Angeles on August 9, 2023, at the age of 80, after a year-long battle with prostate cancer. His manager, Jared Levine, reported that Robertson &quot;was surrounded by his family at the time of his death,&quot; including both Janet Zuccarini and Dominique Robertson, and asked for donations to the Six Nations of the Grand River in lieu of flowers.

In November 2023, director Martin Scorsese held a tribute concert for Robertson in Los Angeles. Notable guests in attendance were Joni Mitchell, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Lily Gladstone.

In May 2024, Robertson&#x27;s three adult children sued his wife Janet Zuccarini, with claims of elder abuse and that she &quot;took advantage of the musician’s declining health to have him sign documents that would favor her in the event of his death.&quot;

In October 2024, another tribute concert with Scorsese&#x27;s involvement was held at the Kia Forum, which featured Bob Weir, Eric Clapton, Mavis Staples among others.

<text>Frederick Kenneth Blassie (February 8, 1918 – June 2, 2003) was an American professional wrestler and manager, known by the ring name &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie. Renowned as &quot;The Hollywood Fashion Plate&quot;, he was a one-time NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion, and was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1994. He is regarded as one of the greatest wrestling heels, or villains, of all time.

== Early life ==
Blassie was born Frederick Kenneth Blassie in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1918. His parents, Anna (née Szind) and Jacob Blassie (né Blaszi), were immigrants from Austria-Hungary who arrived in the United States in 1912 via Hamburg, Germany.

Frederick was an only child. His father was an abusive alcoholic, prompting Frederick to stay with his grandparents whenever Jacob beat Anna. His parents repeatedly separated, only to reconcile. At the age of 13, after Jacob had beaten Anna again, Frederick threatened his father with a baseball bat; instead, he lived with his aunt for six months until his mother asked him to return home. As an adult, Frederick was a teetotaler.

He graduated from McKinley High School and began work at a meatpacking plant. He also began boxing at a local community center and won a heavyweight championship title. However, he became increasingly interested in wrestling. As the wrestlers became familiar with him, they began teaching him holds. His first public wrestling match was a shoot fight which he accepted hoping to impress a girl he brought to the show. Later, he received regular work wrestling at local carnivals. His cousin John Frank Holaus often refereed his matches.

Blassie&#x27;s famous &quot;pencil-neck geek&quot; catchphrase originated early in his career while describing a fellow carnival performer who appeared in a geek show. Blassie described this performer as &quot;having a neck like a stack of dimes and a real pencil-neck geek&quot;.

His career continued; he was hired by more established promoters, including Tom Packs in St. Louis and George Simpson in Kansas City.

==Military service==
After the US entered World War II, Blassie enlisted in the Navy and served in the Pacific Theater for 42 months. He married a girl in California while on shore leave. He achieved the rank of Petty Officer (Second Class) before he was discharged.

==Professional wrestling career==
Upon Blassie&#x27;s return from the war, he was billed as &quot;Sailor&quot; Fred Blassie to capitalize on the wave of war-time patriotism sweeping the country, but that gimmick was unsuccessful. He worked for Jack Pfefer, who he claimed would only employ people who looked like sideshow freaks at his shows, and whose wrestlers included Tor Johnson, who made movies with director Ed Wood, and Lillian Ellison, the Fabulous Moolah. During this time, he went to New York City to work for promoter Jess McMahon.

===NWA Los Angeles (1952–1953)===
In 1952, Blassie moved to Los Angeles to work for Jules Strongbow. He teamed with Billy McDaniel as the McDaniel Brothers, but when they went east, they were known as the Blassie Brothers.

=== Georgia Championship Wrestling (1953–1960) ===
In 1953, he worked in the Atlanta-based Georgia Championship Wrestling territory for Paul Jones (the wrestler of the 1930s, not the wrestler/manager of the 1980s). While there, he won the NWA Georgia Southern Heavyweight Championship, the holder of which was generally first in line to challenge the NWA World Heavyweight Champion whenever he passed through the territory. It was also during this period of his career when he dropped his babyface gimmick and became a full-fledged heel. The fans consistently booed him because he was considered a &quot;Yankee&quot;. He also bleached his hair at this time, as many of the other stars of the era did, such as Gorgeous George, Johnny Valentine, and &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers. He was often billed as &quot;The Vampire&quot; during this time for biting his opponents and filing his teeth during interviews and promos.

===Worldwide Wrestling Associates (1960–1971)===
In 1960, Blassie returned to Strongbow&#x27;s promotion in Los Angeles, where he was a big star for Worldwide Wrestling Associates (WWA) of southern California, drawing many fans to the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles. He was so hated there that uniformed police officers were regularly brought in to protect him as he made his way to and from the ring. He had main event-level feuds against stars such as The Destroyer.

On June 12, 1961, Blassie defeated the &quot;Flying Frenchman&quot; Édouard Carpentier in a best-of-three-falls match for his first WWA World Heavyweight Championship. On July 7, Blassie successfully defended his title against the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Lou Thesz. During that same title reign, in a match against Lord James Blears a fan threw acid on his back, and he had to return immediately to the locker room to wash it off; over the course of his career, he was also stabbed 21 times and lost vision in his right eye after being struck by a thrown hard-boiled egg. Blassie lost the title to Rikidōzan on March 28, 1962.

Blassie claims that he made Regis Philbin into the celebrity he is today. When Philbin had a late-night weekend talk show in San Diego, Blassie would routinely show up to yell at the audience, throw furniture, and threaten Philbin; the confrontations were wholly kayfabe and both of them were friends when the cameras weren&#x27;t rolling. In later years, Blassie also appeared on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; when Philbin was a guest host.

After regaining the WWA Championship from Rikidōzan on July 25, 1962, Blassie lost the title two days later to the &quot;Masked Destroyer&quot; Dick Beyer. In 1963, Bearcat Wright defeated him to become champion, and it was quite a statement during the fight for civil rights that an African-American had won such a title. In 1964, Dick the Bruiser defeated Blassie to become champion, and Blassie headed east to work for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF).

Blassie returned to WWA in 1968 just as promoter Mike LeBell decided to rejoin the NWA. In the early 1970s, Blassie &quot;turned face&quot;, or became a good guy, since so many fans were cheering his famous antics. While there, he feuded with Soulman Rocky Johnson, The Sheik, and &quot;The Golden Greek&quot; John Tolos. One of his most famous feuds took place in southern California in 1971, against Tolos. The final match of their series took place in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and set new California records for both attendance and gate.

===Japan (1962–1968)===

In 1962, Blassie had a feud with Japanese wrestling icon Rikidōzan that established his reputation in Japan. After Blassie lost the WWA World Heavyweight Championship to Rikidōzan in Los Angeles, the two had a rematch on live Japanese television. Many of the viewers were horrified by Blassie&#x27;s treatment of their hero. One of Blassie&#x27;s gimmicks was to file his teeth, and draw blood from his opponents by biting their foreheads. The sight of the Japanese legend covered in his own blood gave several viewers heart attacks, and some reportedly died.

While touring Japan in 1965, and by this point divorced, Blassie met the woman who would eventually become his third wife, Miyako Morozumi, at a train station. However, later that year Blassie suffered from kidney stones and had surgery to remove them. While recuperating in 1966, he worked as a car salesman and married a second time to a woman whose name Blassie later claimed not to remember.

In 1968, Blassie returned to Japan and was reunited with Miyako. When he asked for her parents&#x27; blessing, they were hesitant because of his reputation with Rikidōzan and because he was 28 years older than her. However, they eventually consented and Miyako returned with Blassie to the United States; they were married on September 30, 1968.

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1964; 1971-1974)===
In 1964, Blassie feuded with Bruno Sammartino and Bobo Brazil. Blassie came into the WWWF with his own world title belt, claiming to be the Pacific World Champion, and was coming to Sammartino&#x27;s &quot;back yard&quot; to unify the world title. The series began at Roosevelt Stadium, Jersey City, New Jersey in 1964, with Blassie winning on a technicality, but not a pin. The rematches were held at Madison Square Garden in New York, with Sammartino winning out.

He returned to the company in 1971, reaching the final of a tournament in January for the vacant WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship before losing to Pedro Morales. Blassie later challenged Morales for the WWWF Championship, but came up short. During this stint with the company, Blassie was managed by his future fellow &quot;Wise Man of the East&quot; and eventual nemesis, &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano.

===Return to Japan (1972–1974)===
Blassie returned to Japan to work for both the newly All Japan Pro Wrestling in 1972. In 1974, he worked for New Japan Pro Wrestling.

===Management career (1974–1986)===

Blassie retired from active wrestling in 1974, due to a California law that prohibited anyone over 55 from getting a wrestling license. His knees were also in terrible condition, which also contributed to his retirement. Afterwards he became a manager in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) and its subsequent incarnation the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He performed for that promotion until his full retirement from professional wrestling in 1986. Blassie, Lou Albano, and The Grand Wizard were named &quot;The Three Wise Men of the East&quot;, as the top three heel managers in the company.

Among the men he managed were Nikolai Volkoff, The Iron Sheik, Blackjack Mulligan, High Chief Peter Maivia, &quot;The Crippler&quot; Ray Stevens, Adrian Adonis, Jesse Ventura, Dick Murdoch, Swede Hanson, Killer Khan, George &#x27;The Animal&#x27; Steele, Professor Tanaka, Mr. Fuji, Ivan Koloff, Tor Kamata, Masa Saito, Lou Albano, Victor Rivera, Kamala, Hercules Hernandez, Louis Cyr, and Hulk Hogan. Blassie also managed Muhammad Ali in his boxer vs. wrestler match in 1976 against Antonio Inoki. Blassie also publicly represented Ali for media events and interviews for a period in the mid-1970s.

One of Blassie&#x27;s most famous proteges was The Iron Sheik. Blassie led Sheik to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship over Bob Backlund on December 26, 1983, in Madison Square Garden. After Sheik lost the belt to Blassie&#x27;s former managed wrestler Hulk Hogan, Blassie managed Sheik in various rematches around the country throughout the first half of 1984, culminating into another major televised rematch on December 28, 1984, once again in Madison Square Garden. In this match Hogan was once again victorious. After managing Sheik through a brief feud with Andre the Giant, he also became the manager of Nikolai Volkoff, with Sheik and Volkoff later becoming a tag team. Blassie would gain even more gold when Volkoff and Sheik defeated The US Express managed by Albano who had turned babyface in December 1984 to Blassie&#x27;s kayfabe disgust, for the WWF Tag Team Championship at the first ever Wrestlemania. Blassie got involved when he threw his cane into the ring, with Sheik and Volkoff using it to their advantage to gain the victory. When Gene Okerlund confronted Blassie in an interview after the match, Blassie said, &quot;what cane, I didn&#x27;t have no cane!&quot;

Blassie continued to manage Sheik and Volkoff even after they lost the tag team titles. Blassie unsuccessfully campaigned along with the other managers to manage &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage when Savage first entered the WWF in June 1985. Blassie continued to interfere from ringside in matches, especially during Volkoff&#x27;s feud with Corporal Kirchner. Blassie&#x27;s interference at Wrestlemania 2 cost Volkoff his match with Kirchner, when the cane was grabbed by Kirchner instead of Volkoff. In the summer of 1986, Blassie started to slowly phase himself out of the WWF and into retirement.

On an episode of &quot;WWF Championship Wrestling&quot;, Blassie barged into the announcer booth to proclaim that he had sold half of the contracts of Sheik and Volkoff to a mysterious benefactor for a large sum of money. This benefactor was later revealed to be Slick. Blassie appeared alongside Slick to co-manage Sheik and Volkoff for a few television appearances before finally bowing out in November 1986, with Albano, the final member of the Three Wise Men, retiring a few weeks later.

===Commentator career (1986-1990)===
Because of his close relationship with Vince McMahon, Sr. and his family, Blassie remained on the WWF payroll until the day he died. He sporadically returned to make brief appearances following his retirement in 1986, mostly in produced video packages hyping the &quot;new generation&quot; of wrestling. He was given a commentary tryout in 1986 and 1987 for &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot;, calling a few matches with Gorilla Monsoon. He briefly turned face in 1989, making an appearance on &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot; angry with Bobby Heenan over money Heenan hadn&#x27;t paid him back. He returned again in 1990 briefly to do color commentary for &quot;Prime Time&quot; in April with Vince McMahon, as an emergency fill-in after Tony Schiavone quit, playing a heel once again.

===Guest appearances and death (1994-2003)===
Blassie was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1994 by Shane McMahon. In 1998, Blassie was the winner at the fourth annual Cauliflower Alley Club East Coast Banquet. In 1999, he was shown making the opening narration of WrestleMania XV. In 2000, Blassie made an appearance at the Royal Rumble as a judge in the Miss Rumble 2000 Swimsuit contest, which was won by Mae Young. Blassie also appeared in the SummerSlam opening video. In 2001, Blassie appeared in a special July 16, 2001 &quot;Raw is War&quot; segment for the Invasion storyline, wherein he exhorted a gathering of WWF wrestlers to stand tall against The Alliance – and later got mocked by Alliance leaders Shane and Stephanie McMahon. Because of this, Blassie is one of, if not the only man to have worked with all four generations of the McMahon family. Images from his WrestleMania XV promo were also included in the opening of the 2001 Survivor Series. Blassie also appeared in a segment at the Vengeance pay-per-view event in December 2001, where an &quot;undisputed&quot; champion would be crowned. His final wrestling appearance was May 12, 2003 in Philadelphia on &quot;Raw&quot;, three weeks before his death. The segment featured Blassie, his wife, and Raw co-General Manager Eric Bischoff, who was about to allow 3 Minute Warning to attack him, until Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Dudley Boyz stepped in. His final words on WWE television were &quot;D-Von, get the table!&quot;, to a monstrous applause. His book, &quot;Listen You Pencil Neck Geeks&quot;, was released on May 13, 2003.

On June 2, 2003, Blassie died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 85. His death was announced by Jim Ross, 20 minutes into that same day&#x27;s episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

==Music career==
In 1977, Blassie recorded voiceovers for the songs &quot;Blassie, King of Men&quot; and &quot;Pencil Neck Geek&quot;, which were performed by Johnny Legend, featuring Billy Zoom on guitar, Jay Phillips on guitar, Lon Osgood on bass and Steve Clark on drums. They received acclaim on the Dr. Demento Radio Show, and the latter song was featured on several albums, including Dr. Demento&#x27;s 20th anniversary collection, &quot;The Very Best of Dr. Demento&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Demento Presents the Greatest Novelty CDs of All Time&quot;. In 1983, Rhino Records released a 14-track album by Blassie, titled &quot;I Bite the Songs&quot;.

==Film career==
Blassie appeared in an episode of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; that featured a new dance craze called The Twizzle. Rose Marie&#x27;s character Sally Rogers brought him on at the end of the episode claiming to have discovered another new dance sensation. In the demonstration of the dance, Blassie picked up Rob Petrie and twirled him over his head.

Filmed in 1982, &quot;My Breakfast with Blassie&quot; featured Andy Kaufman and Freddie Blassie eating at a Sambo&#x27;s in Los Angeles. (The film was referenced by American rock band R.E.M. in their 1992 song about Kaufman, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;.) The movie&#x27;s title and premise are parodies of the 1981 art-house classic &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;.

&quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie appeared in a live-action segment of the cartoon &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling.&quot; In the segment he is interviewed by &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Okerlund when the two are interrupted by a little old lady in a housekeeper outfit that Blassie claims to be his own mother.

&quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie also made a cameo appearance as himself, along with &quot;Wrestling&#x27;s Living Legend&quot; Bruno Sammartino, and Ric Flair in the 1986 film &quot;Body Slam&quot; starring Dirk Benedict, &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano, and &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper.

In the early 1990s, the wrestler starred in a documentary directed by Jeff Krulik, titled &quot;Mr. Blassie Goes To Washington&quot;. In it, Blassie is picked up at the Washington, D.C., airport by a limo full of young women, escorted around the nation&#x27;s capital, gives his opinions and confronts tourists. When meeting someone, he would ask where they were from, and no matter their response, he would reply with, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s God&#x27;s country!&quot;

<text>Watcom International Corporation was a software company, which was founded in 1981 by Wes Graham and Ian McPhee. Founding staff (Fred Crigger, Jack Schueler and McPhee) were formerly members of Professor Graham&#x27;s Computer Systems Group at the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Watcom produced a variety of tools, including the well-known Watcom C/C++ compiler introduced in 1988.

The first company started by Graham and McPhee was Structured Computing Systems, incorporated in 1974. Then the software development company, WATCOM Systems Inc, started in 1981 with three full-time employees, but had been incorporated two years earlier as Waterloo Basic Enterprises Limited. In 1984, the various subsidiary companies of The WATCOM Group software organization—marketing and sales, publications, seminars and systems (software development) --  were all renamed as WATCOM companies for consistent branding. These were later all merged into one full-service software company, WATCOM International Inc.

==History==
Waterloo BASIC programming language was one of the earliest Watcom products and predates the existence of the company. During 1978 to 1979 Waterloo BASIC was developed targeting the IBM Series/1. In 1979 the system was ported to VM/CMS running on the IBM 370, 3030, and 4300 computers and an agreement was reached with IBM to market the compiler. Between 1980 and 1983 updated versions were released including ports to the MVS/TSO and VM/CMS. In addition to Waterloo BASIC some of the other early products included WATCOM APL, WATCOM GKS, WATCOM COBOL, WATCOM FORTRAN (WATFIV and WATFOR-77), WATCOM Pascal and the Waterloo 6809 Assembler. These were the basis and provided with the Commodore SuperPET .

In the mid 1980s Watcom developed compilers for the Unisys ICON computers running the QNX operating system. The Watcom C/C++ compiler with QNX developed a market for embedded applications.

In 1988, Watcom released their first C compiler for the IBM PC platform (and compatibles). It was released with a version number of 6 at a time when the latest version numbers of Borland&#x27;s and Microsoft&#x27;s C Compilers were version 5. These version numbers signified nothing and were used for marketing purposes. The compiler could create tighter and faster code than its competition.

In 1992, Watcom began a move into the client-server arena with the introduction of Watcom SQL, a SQL database server product. Being a very small company (about 8 developers) they managed to produce high quality software, famous among software developers. Watcom SQL is still in production, now under the name &quot;SAP SQL Anywhere&quot;.

In 1993, the VX-REXX system was released.

Watcom was acquired by Powersoft in 1994, and Powersoft merged with Sybase in 1995. In May 2000, Sybase spun off their mobile and embedded computing division into its own company, Sybase iAnywhere (formerly iAnywhere Solutions Inc.). Sybase tried to re-target the Watcom compiler into a visual RAD tool, &quot;Optima++&quot;, but in 2003, because the product competed directly with the Sybase offering PowerBuilder, the product was discontinued. Its sister product, Optima-J, was continued. In 2003, the Watcom C/C++ and Fortran compilers were released as an open source project under a new name, Open Watcom.

==Users and reception==
&quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Descent&quot;, &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;System Shock&quot;, &quot;Fast Attack&quot;, &quot;Atomic Bomberman&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and &quot;Fallout&quot; are among well known games that were compiled with Watcom C and DOS/4GW.

Novell&#x27;s Netware386 and Fox Software&#x27;s FoxPro 2 were compiled with Watcom C/C++.

<text>A declaration of war is a formal act by which one state announces existing or impending war activity against another. The declaration is a performative speech act (or the public signing of a document) by an authorized party of a national government, in order to create a state of war between two or more states.

The legality of who is competent to declare war varies between nations and forms of government. In many nations, that power is given to the head of state or sovereign. In other cases, something short of a full declaration of war, such as a letter of marque or a covert operation, may authorise war-like acts by privateers or mercenaries. The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in the Hague Convention (III) of 1907 on the Opening of Hostilities.

Since 1945, developments in international law such as the United Nations Charter, which prohibits both the threat and the use of force in international conflicts, have made declarations of war largely obsolete in international relations, though such declarations may have relevance within the domestic law of the belligerents or of neutral nations. The UN Security Council, under powers granted in articles 24 and 25, and Chapter VII of the Charter, may authorize collective action to maintain or enforce international peace and security. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter also states that: &quot;Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a state.&quot;

Declarations of war have been exceedingly rare since the end of World War II. Scholars have debated the causes of the decline, with some arguing that states are trying to evade the restrictions of international humanitarian law (which governs conduct in war) while others argue that war declarations have come to be perceived as markers of aggression and maximalist aims.

==History==

The practice of declaring war has a long history. The ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh gives an account of it, as does the Old Testament. The Roman Republic formalized the declaration of war by a special ceremony, the ritual of the Fetials, though the practice started to decline into the Imperial era.

However, the practice of declaring war was not always strictly followed. In his study &quot;Hostilities without Declaration of War&quot; (1883), the British scholar John Frederick Maurice showed that between 1700 and 1870 war was declared in only 10 cases, while in another 107 cases war was waged without such declaration (these figures include only wars waged in Europe and between European states and the United States, not including colonial wars in Africa and Asia).

In modern public international law, a declaration of war entails the recognition between countries of a state of hostilities between these countries, and such declaration has acted to regulate the conduct between the military engagements between the forces of the respective countries. The primary multilateral treaties governing such declarations are the Hague Conventions.

The League of Nations, formed in 1919 in the wake of the First World War, and the General Treaty for the Renunciation of War of 1928 signed in Paris, France, demonstrated that world powers were seriously seeking a means to prevent the carnage of another world war. Nevertheless, these powers were unable to stop the outbreak of the Second World War, so the United Nations was established following that war in a renewed attempt to prevent international aggression through declarations of war.

===Denigration of formal declarations of war before WWI===
In classical times, Thucydides condemned the Thebans, allies of Sparta, for launching a surprise attack without a declaration of war against Plataea, Athens&#x27; ally – an event that began the Peloponnesian War.

The utility of formal declarations of war has always been questioned, either as sentimental remnants of a long-gone age of chivalry or as imprudent warnings to the enemy. For example, writing in 1737, Cornelius van Bynkershoek judged that &quot;nations and princes endowed with some pride are not generally willing to wage war without a previous declaration, for they wish by an open attack to render victory more honourable and glorious.&quot; Writing in 1880, William Edward Hall judged that &quot;any sort of previous declaration therefore is an empty formality unless the enemy must be given time and opportunity to put himself in a state of defence, and it is needless to say that no one asserts such a quixotism to be obligatory.&quot;

===Formal declarations of war during World War I===
===Formal declarations of war during World War II===
===Declared wars since 1945===
Declarations of war, while uncommon in the traditional sense, have mainly been limited to the conflict areas of the Western Asia and East Africa since 1945. Additionally, some small states have unilaterally declared war on major world powers such as the United States or Russia when faced with a hostile invasion and/or occupation. The following is a list of declarations of war (or the existence of war) by one sovereign state against another since the end of World War II in 1945. Only declarations that occurred in the context of a direct military conflict are included.

===Other unique cases===

====Russo-Ukrainian War====
No formal declaration of war has been issued in the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. At the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Putin gave a televised broadcast announcing the start of the invasion with the term &quot;special military operation&quot;, side-stepping a formal declaration of war. The statement was, however, regarded as a declaration of war by the Ukrainian government and reported as such by many international news sources. While the Ukrainian parliament refers to Russia as a &quot;terrorist state&quot; in regards to its military actions in Ukraine, it has not issued a formal declaration of war on its behalf.

==Procedures==
In Title II, Article 2 of the first Hague Convention of 1899, the signatory states agreed that at least one other nation be used to mediate disputes between states before engaging in hostilities:

The Hague Convention (III) of 1907 called &quot;Convention Relative to the Opening of Hostilities&quot; gives the international actions a country should perform when opening hostilities. The first two Articles say:

=== The United Nations and war ===
In an effort to force nations to resolve issues without warfare, framers of the United Nations Charter attempted to commit member nations to using warfare only under limited circumstances, particularly for defensive purposes.

The UN became a combatant itself after North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, which began the Korean War. The UN Security Council condemned the North Korean action by a 9–0 resolution (with the Soviet Union absent) and called upon its member nations to come to the aid of South Korea. The United States and 15 other nations formed a &quot;UN force&quot; to pursue this action. In a press conference on 29 June 1950, US President Harry S. Truman characterized these hostilities as not being a &quot;war&quot; but a &quot;police action&quot;.

The United Nations has issued Security Council Resolutions that declared some wars to be legal actions under international law, most notably Resolution 678, authorizing the 1991 Gulf War which was triggered by Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait. UN Resolutions authorise the use of &quot;force&quot; or &quot;all necessary means&quot;.

==Legality==
The legality of who is competent to declare war varies between nations and forms of government. In many nations, that power is given to the head of state or sovereign. The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in the Hague Convention (III) of 1907 on the Opening of Hostilities.

Since 1945, developments in international law such as the United Nations Charter, which prohibits both the threat and the use of force in international conflicts, have made declarations of war largely obsolete in international relations, though such declarations may have relevance within the domestic law of the belligerents or of neutral nations. The UN Security Council, under powers granted in articles 24 and 25, and Chapter VII of the Charter, may authorize collective action to maintain or enforce international peace and security. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter also states that: &quot;Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a state.&quot;

==Requirements by country==
Declaring war is usually done through a process that involves prior approval before a formal announcement is made. This differs by country as some do not have a pre-approved process, and a given head of government can declare war with no pre-conditions.

<text>The Northwest Conference (NWC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. Member teams are located in the states of Oregon and Washington. It was known as the Pacific Northwest Conference from 1926 to 1984.

==History==


The Northwest Conference was formed in 1925, making it one of the oldest continuously existing athletics conferences in the western United States. For 60 years, the NWC sponsored sports exclusively for men, but in 1984 it joined with the Women&#x27;s Conference of Independent Colleges to become the Northwest Conference of Independent Colleges, shortening the name to its current moniker in 1996 when it joined the NCAA.

The charter members included Willamette University, Pacific University, Whitman College, the College of Puget Sound (now the University of Puget Sound), Linfield College (now Linfield University), and the College of Idaho. In 1931, Albany College joined, left in 1938, and re-joined in 1949 using its present name of Lewis &amp; Clark College. Pacific Lutheran University was added in 1965, and Whitworth University in 1970. In 1978, the College of Idaho dropped out of the conference. Whitworth also left in 1984, but then returned in 1988. In 1996, George Fox University joined when the conference moved to the NCAA and Puget Sound re-joined in that same year since 1948. From 2006 to 2010, Menlo College was also a part of the conference as an associate member in football.

The College of Idaho reinstated its football program in 2014 after a 37-year hiatus and joined the Frontier Conference for football. College of Idaho is now a member of the NAIA&#x27;s Cascade Collegiate Conference for other sports. Whitworth left the NWC in 1984 but returned in 1988. George Fox University and Seattle University joined the conference in 1997. Seattle dropped out again in 1999 to become members of NCAA Division II. Menlo College joined the conference in 2005 as a football-only member.

==Sports ==

The Northwest Conference sponsors championship competition in nine men&#x27;s and 11 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. 
==McIlroy-Lewis All-Sports Trophy==
Each year the NWC awards one of its member institutions the NWC McIlroy-Lewis All-Sports Trophy, based on a points system. The award is named in honor of Jane McIlroy, former athletic director of Linfield (1950-82), and John Lewis of Willamette (1947-72).

In each sport, the conference champion is awarded 18 points, second place is awarded 16 points, and so on. The school with the most points at the conclusion of the academic year wins the trophy.

<text>The Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference which competes in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III. All member institutions are located in Ohio. Formed in 1902, it is the third oldest athletic conference in the United States. In its history, 31 schools have been members of the OAC. The enrollments of the current ten member institutions range from around 1,000 to 4,500. Its current commissioner is Sarah Otey. Former commissioners include Mike Cleary, who was the first General Manager of a professional basketball team to hire an African American head coach, and would later run the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA). 

==History==
The Ohio Athletic Conference was found in 1902 with six charter members—Case Tech, Kenyon, Oberlin, Ohio State, Ohio Wesleyan, and Western Reserve. By 1934, the conference reached an all-time high of twenty-four members, seeing many schools come and go throughout the upcoming decades. By 2000, the conference solidified to its current form with the addition of its final school, Wilmington, to ten members.

On January 18, 2024, John Carroll University announces departure from the OAC to the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC), beginning in the 2025–26 academic year.

<text>Oriental Mindoro (), officially the Province of Oriental Mindoro (), is a province in the Philippines located on the island of Mindoro under Mimaropa region in Luzon, about southwest of Manila. The province is bordered by the Verde Island Passage and the rest of Batangas to the north, by Marinduque, Maestre de Campo (or known as &quot;Sibale&quot; but official name is &quot;Concepcion&quot;) Island, Tablas Strait and the rest of Romblon to the east, by Semirara and the rest of Caluya Islands, Antique to the south, and by Occidental Mindoro to the west. Its provincial capital Calapan, the only city in the island, is the most-populous in the province, and Mimaropa&#x27;s regional center.

Oriental Mindoro is touted as the country&#x27;s emerging eco-tourism destination. In 2005, the Philippines was found to be the center of marine fish biodiversity and the home of the most diverse marine ecosystem in the world, by American biologists Kent Carpenter and Victor Springer. Most of the endemic species in the Philippines are found in the Verde Island Passage between Mindoro island and the main island of Luzon. The passage houses 2,983 individual species of algae, corals, crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, based on a study conducted by Carpenter and Springer in 2005.

UNESCO declared Puerto Galera a biosphere reserve under its Man and the Biosphere Programme in the 1970s. The Verde Island Passage is at the apex of the so-called Coral Triangle – the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia – which has the distinction of being the &quot;center of the center of the world&#x27;s marine biodiversity&quot; and the &quot;center of the center of marine shorefish biodiversity&quot;.

==History==

=== Japanese occupation era ===
A Japanese force landed on northeastern Mindoro in the Philippine Islands on 27 February 1942.

Almost three years later, after the invasion of Mindoro by Allied forces, they proceeded to land to Bongabong and heading to and capturing Calapan, the capital of the united Mindoro Province at the time on 24 January 1945.

===Philippine independence===
====Foundation====
After World War II, reconstruction and rehabilitation of infrastructure and economy took place on the island, which then constituted a single province. This was partitioned on 13 June 1950 into Oriental Mindoro and Occidental Mindoro by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 505&quot;.

In the decades after the War, Mindoro attracted settlers from overpopulated provinces in the Philippines. Apart from the hope to become landowners or to have better tenancy conditions, the Hukbalahap Rebellion in Central Luzon was an important factor for migration. Under the settlement program of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) founded in 1954, families from Central Luzon were settled in the Bongabong-Pinamalayan area. This project ended in 1956 after 606 families (3,636 people) were settled on of public land. Since then, new settlers continue to migrate to Mindoro until today.

===Contemporary===
On November 15, 1994, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the Verde Island Passage located north of Oriental Mindoro, killing 69 people in the province, with most casualties due to the tsunami caused by the earthquake. Within a year after the calamity, however, the provincial government under Governor Rodolfo G. Valencia was able to successfully rehabilitate the province in a brisk manner, and was thus conferred the Disaster Management Award by the National Disaster Coordinating Council in July 1995.

The island currently sees an ongoing conflict between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and insurgents. On March 6, 2010, eleven soldiers were killed and seven were hurt in a gun battle with the New People&#x27;s Army in Mansalay, Oriental Mindoro.

<text>Simplified Chinese characters are one of two standardized character sets widely used to write the Chinese language, with the other being traditional characters. Their mass standardization during the 20th century was part of an initiative by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) to promote literacy, and their use in ordinary circumstances on the mainland has been encouraged by the Chinese government since the 1950s. They are the official forms used in mainland China and Singapore, while traditional characters are officially used in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

Simplification of a component—either a character or a sub-component called a radical—usually involves either a reduction in its total number of strokes, or an apparent streamlining of which strokes are chosen in what places—for example, the radical used in the traditional character is simplified to to form the simplified character . By systematically simplifying radicals, large swaths of the character set are altered. Some simplifications were based on popular cursive forms that embody graphic or phonetic simplifications of the traditional forms. In addition, variant characters with identical pronunciation and meaning were reduced to a single standardized character, usually the simplest among all variants in form. Finally, many characters were left untouched by simplification and are thus identical between the traditional and simplified Chinese orthographies.

The Chinese government has never officially announced the completion of the simplification process after the bulk of characters were introduced by the 1960s. In the wake of the Cultural Revolution, a second round of simplified characters was promulgated in 1977—largely composed of entirely new variants intended to artificially lower the stroke count, in contrast to the first round—but was massively unpopular and never saw consistent use. The second round of simplifications was ultimately retracted officially in 1986, well after they had largely ceased to be used due to their unpopularity and the confusion they caused. In August 2009, China began collecting public comments for a revised list of simplified characters; the resulting &quot;List of Commonly Used Standard Chinese Characters&quot; lists 8,105 characters, including a few revised forms, and was implemented for official use by China&#x27;s State Council on 5 June 2013.

== Nomenclature ==
In Chinese, simplified characters are referred to by their official name , or colloquially as . The latter term refers broadly to all character variants featuring simplifications of character form or structure, a practice which has always been present as a part of the Chinese writing system. The official name tends to refer to the specific, systematic set published by the Chinese government, which includes not only simplifications of individual characters, but also a substantial reduction in the total number of characters through the merger of formerly distinct forms.

== History ==
=== Background ===

According to Chinese palaeographer Qiu Xigui, the broadest trend in the evolution of Chinese characters over their history has been simplification, both in graphical &quot;shape&quot; (), the &quot;external appearances of individual graphs&quot;, and in graphical &quot;form&quot; (), &quot;overall changes in the distinguishing features of graphic[al] shape and calligraphic style, [...] in most cases refer[ring] to rather obvious and rather substantial changes&quot;. The initiatives following the founding of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) to universalize the use of their small seal script across the recently conquered parts of the empire is generally seen as being the first real attempt at script reform in Chinese history.

Before the 20th century, variation in character shape on the part of scribes, which would continue with the later invention of woodblock printing, was ubiquitous. For example, prior to the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) the character meaning &#x27;bright&#x27; was written as either or —with either or on the left, with the component on the right. Li Si (), the Chancellor of Qin, attempted to universalize the Qin small seal script across China following the wars that had politically unified the country for the first time. Li prescribed the form of the word for &#x27;bright&#x27;, but some scribes ignored this and continued to write the character as . However, the increased usage of was followed by proliferation of a third variant: , with on the left—likely derived as a contraction of . Ultimately, became the character&#x27;s standard form.

The &quot;Book of Han&quot; (111 AD) describes an earlier attempt made by King Xuan of Zhou () to unify character forms across the states of ancient China, with his chief chronicler having &quot;[written] fifteen chapters describing&quot; what is referred to as the &quot;big seal script&quot;. The traditional narrative, as also attested in the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; dictionary (), is that the Qin small seal script that would later be imposed across China was originally derived from the Zhou big seal script with few modifications. However, the body of epigraphic evidence comparing the character forms used by scribes gives no indication of any real consolidation in character forms prior to the founding of the Qin. The Han dynasty (202 BC220 AD) that inherited the Qin administration coincided with the perfection of clerical script through the process of &quot;libian&quot;.

=== Late Qing literature and Republican-era reform (1850–1949) ===

Though most closely associated with the People&#x27;s Republic, the idea of a mass simplification of character forms first gained traction in China during the early 20th century. In 1909, the educator and linguist Lufei Kui formally proposed the use of simplified characters in education for the first time. Over the following years—marked by the 1911 Xinhai Revolution that toppled the Qing dynasty, followed by growing social and political discontent that further erupted into the 1919 May Fourth Movement—many anti-imperialist intellectuals throughout China began to see the country&#x27;s writing system as a serious impediment to its modernization. In 1916, a multi-part English-language article entitled &quot;The Problem of the Chinese Language&quot; co-authored by the Chinese linguist Yuen Ren Chao (1892–1982) and poet Hu Shih (1891–1962) has been identified as a turning point in the history of the Chinese script—as it was one of the first clear calls for China to move away from the use of characters entirely. Instead, Chao proposed that the language be written with an alphabet, which he saw as more logical and efficient. The alphabetization and simplification campaigns would exist alongside one another among the Republican intelligentsia for the next several decades.

Recent commentators have echoed some contemporary claims that Chinese characters were blamed for the economic problems in China during that time. Lu Xun, one of the most prominent Chinese authors of the 20th century, stated that &quot;if Chinese characters are not destroyed, then China will die&quot; (). During the 1930s and 1940s, discussions regarding simplification took place within the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party. Many members of the Chinese intelligentsia maintained that simplification would increase literacy rates throughout the country. In 1935, the first official list of simplified forms was published, consisting of 324 characters collated by Peking University professor Qian Xuantong. However, fierce opposition within the KMT resulted in the list being rescinded in 1936.

=== First round of simplification (1949–1977) ===
Work throughout the 1950s resulted in the 1956 promulgation of the &quot;Chinese Character Simplification Scheme&quot;, a draft of 515 simplified characters and 54 simplified components, whose simplifications would be present in most compound characters. Over the following decade, the Script Reform Committee deliberated on characters in the 1956 scheme, collecting public input regarding the recognizability of variants, and often approving forms in small batches. Parallel to simplification, there were also initiatives aimed at eliminating the use of characters entirely and replacing them with pinyin as an official Chinese alphabet, but this possibility was abandoned, confirmed by a speech given by Zhou Enlai in 1958. In 1965, the PRC published the &quot;&quot; (hereafter &quot;Characters for Printing&quot;), which included standard printed forms for 6196 characters, including all of the forms from the 1956 scheme.

=== Second round of simplification (1977–1986) ===

A second round of simplified characters was promulgated in 1977, but was poorly received by the public and quickly fell out of official use. It was ultimately formally rescinded in 1986. The second-round simplifications were unpopular in large part because most of the forms were completely new, in contrast to the familiar variants comprising the majority of the first round. With the rescission of the second round, work toward further character simplification largely came to an end.

=== Since 1986 ===
In 1986, authorities retracted the second round completely, though they had been largely fallen out of use within a year of their initial introduction. That year, the authorities also promulgated a final version of the &quot;General List of Simplified Chinese Characters&quot;. It was identical to the 1964 list save for 6 changes—including the restoration of 3 characters that had been simplified in the first round: , , ; the form is used instead of in regions using traditional characters. The Chinese government stated that it wished to keep Chinese orthography stable.

The &quot;Chart of Generally Utilized Characters of Modern Chinese&quot; was published in 1988 and included simplified and unsimplified characters. Of these, half were also included in the revised &quot;List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese&quot;, which specified common characters and less common characters. In 2009, the Chinese government published a major revision to the list which included a total of characters. No new simplifications were introduced. In addition, slight modifications to the orthography of 44 characters to fit traditional calligraphic rules were initially proposed, but were not implemented due to negative public response. Also, the practice of unrestricted simplification of rare and archaic characters by analogy using simplified radicals or components is now discouraged. A State Language Commission official cited &quot;oversimplification&quot; as the reason for restoring some characters. The language authority declared an open comment period until 31 August 2009, for feedback from the public.

In 2013, the &quot;List of Commonly Used Standard Chinese Characters&quot; was published as a revision of the 1988 lists; it included a total of characters. It included 45 newly recognized standard characters that were previously considered variant forms, as well as official approval of 226 characters that had been simplified by analogy and had seen wide use but were not explicitly given in previous lists or documents.

=== Outside mainland China ===
Singapore underwent three successive rounds of character simplification, eventually arriving at the same set of simplified characters as mainland China. The first round was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in 1969, consisting of 498 simplified characters derived from 502 traditional characters. A second round of 2287 simplified characters was promulgated in 1974. The second set contained 49 differences from the mainland China system; these were removed in the final round in 1976. In 1993, Singapore adopted the 1986 mainland China revisions. Unlike in mainland China, Singapore parents have the option of registering their children&#x27;s names in traditional characters.

Malaysia also promulgated a set of simplified characters in 1981, though completely identical to the mainland Chinese set. They are used in Chinese-language schools.

== Methodology ==

=== Structural simplification ===
All characters simplified this way are enumerated in Charts 1 and 2 of the 1986 &quot;General List of Simplified Chinese Characters&quot;, hereafter the &quot;General List&quot;.
* Chart 1 lists all 350 characters that are used by themselves, and can never serve as &#x27;simplified character components&#x27;.
* Chart 2 lists 132 characters that are used by themselves as well as utilized as simplified character components to further derive other simplified characters. Chart 2 also lists 14 components or radicals that cannot be used by themselves, but can be generalized for derivation of more complex characters.

=== Derivation based on simplified components ===
* Chart 3 of the &quot;General List&quot; includes characters which are simplified based on the same simplification principles used for components and radicals in Chart 2. This list is non-exhaustive, so if a character is not already found in Charts 1–3, but can be simplified in accordance with Chart 2, the character should be simplified.

=== Elimination of variants ===
* accounts for some of the orthography differences in mainland China versus in Hong Kong and Taiwan. These are not simplifications of character structures, but rather reduction in number of total standard characters. For each set of variants with identical pronunciation and meaning, one character—usually the simplest—is elevated to the standard character set, and the rest are obsoleted. By 1993, variants were declared obsolete by this list. Among the chosen variants, those that appear in the 1986 &quot;Complete List&quot; are also simplified in character structure accordingly.

=== Novel forms ===
* New standardized character forms originated from the 1965 &quot;Characters for Printing&quot; list containing characters. These tend to be vulgar variant forms for most of its characters. The 1988 &quot;List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese&quot; (hereafter &quot;Common Modern Characters&quot;) contains characters, and replaces the 1965 list. Since the new forms take vulgar variants, many characters now appear slightly simpler compared to old forms, and as such are often mistaken as being structurally simplified.

=== Structural simplification ===
All characters simplified this way are enumerated in Chart 1 and Chart 2 in the 1986 &quot;Complete List&quot;. Characters in both charts are structurally simplified based on similar set of principles. They are separated into two charts to clearly mark those in Chart 2 as &#x27;usable as simplified character components&#x27;, based on which Chart 3 is derived.

=== Simplifying components ===
Based on 132 characters and 14 components listed in Chart 2 of the &quot;Complete List&quot;, the 1,753 derived characters found in Chart 3 can be created by systematically simplifying components using Chart 2 as a conversion table. While exercising such derivation, the following rules should be observed:

* The &quot;Complete List&quot; employs character components, not traditional radicals. A component refers to any conceivable part of a character, regardless of its position within the character, or its relative size compared to other components in the same character. For instance, in the character , not only is (a traditional radical) considered a component, but so is .
** Each of the 132 &quot;simplified characters&quot; in Chart 2, when used as a &quot;component&quot; in compound characters, systematically simplify compound characters in exactly the same way the Chart 2 character itself was simplified. For instance, is simplified in Chart 2 to . Based on the same principle, these derivations can be made: → ; → ; → 
** The 14 &quot;simplified components&quot; in Chart 2 are never used alone as individual characters. They only serve as components. Example of derived simplification based on the component , simplified to (), include: → ; → ; → 
* Chart 1 collects 352 simplified characters that &quot;generally cannot be used as components&quot;. Even in rare cases where a Chart 1 character is found as a component in a compound character, the compound character cannot be simplified in the same way. For instance, is simplified in Chart 1 to , but cannot be simplified to .
* A character that is already explicitly listed as simplified character in the &quot;Complete List of Simplified Characters&quot; cannot be alternatively simplified based on derivation. For instance, and are simplified in Chart 1 to and respectively, thus they cannot be simplified alternatively by derivation via and in Chart 2 to and . is simplified in Chart 2 to , thus it cannot be alternatively derived via in Chart 2 as .

Sample Derivations:
: → (), thus → ; → ; → 
: → , thus → ; → ; → 
: → , thus → ; → ; → ; → 
: → , thus → ; → ; → 
: → , thus → ; → ; → ; → 
: → , thus → ; → ; → 

=== Elimination of allographs ===
The Series One List of Variant Characters reduces the number of total standard characters. First, amongst each set of variant characters sharing identical pronunciation and meaning, one character (usually the simplest in form) is elevated to the standard character set, and the rest are made obsolete. Then amongst the chosen variants, those that appear in the &quot;Complete List of Simplified Characters&quot; are also simplified in character structure accordingly. Some examples follow:

Sample reduction of equivalent variants:

Ancient variants with simple structure are preferred:

Simpler vulgar forms are also chosen:

The chosen variant was already simplified in Chart 1:

In some instances, the chosen variant is actually more complex than eliminated ones. An example is the character which is eliminated in favor of the variant form . The with three strokes on the left of the eliminated is now seen as more complex, appearing as the radical , with four strokes, in the chosen variant .

Not all characters standardised in the simplified set consist of fewer strokes. For instance, the traditional character , with 11 strokes is standardised as , with 12 strokes, which is a variant character. Such characters do not constitute simplified characters.

=== Novel forms ===

The new standardized character forms shown in the &quot;Characters for Publishing&quot; and revised through the &quot;Common Modern Characters&quot; list tend to adopt vulgar variant character forms. Since the new forms take vulgar variants, many characters now appear slightly simpler compared to old forms, and as such are often mistaken as structurally simplified characters. Some examples follow:

The traditional component becomes :

The traditional component becomes :

The traditional &quot;Break&quot; stroke becomes the &quot;Dot&quot; stroke:

The traditional components and become :

The traditional component becomes :

=== Inconsistencies ===
A commonly cited example of the irregularity of simplification involves characters that share the &quot;hand&quot; component , which is used in many simplified characters. While there is an observable pattern involving the replacement of 𦰩 with 又 as seen in → , → , → , → , → , when observing that → , → , → , (not simplified) and (not simplified), an inconsistency arises. This is due to the fact that in the Complete List of Simplified Characters, → appears in Chart 1 while → is listed in Chart 2 and → as a derived character in the non-exhaustive list in Chart 3. Therefore, is defined as a &#x27;simplified character component&#x27; according to the standard, while is not. Based on , is simplified to , and to . Since both → and → appear in Chart 1, they are not defined as derived characters. There are therefore no characters or components found in Chart 2 usable for derivation of and . Further investigation reveals that these two characters do not appear in Chart 1 nor in &quot;Series One Organization List of Variant Characters&quot;. Thus they remain unchanged from traditional forms in the &quot;Common Modern Characters&quot; list.

== Distribution ==

The People&#x27;s Republic of China and Singapore generally use simplified characters. They appear very sparingly in texts originating in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities, although they are becoming more prevalent as mainland China becomes more integrated globally.
=== Mainland China ===
The Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the National Common Language and Characters implies that simplified Chinese characters are the country&#x27;s standard script, with traditional Chinese being used for purposes such as ceremonies, cultural purposes such as calligraphy, for decoration, in publications and books on ancient literature and poetry, and for research purposes. Traditional characters remain ubiquitous on buildings that predate the promotion of simplified characters, such as former government buildings, religious buildings, educational institutions, and historical monuments. Traditional characters are also often used for commercial purposes, such as in shopfront displays and advertisements.

As part of the one country, two systems model, the PRC has not attempted to force Hong Kong or Macau into using simplified characters. The PRC tends to print material intended for people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese in traditional characters. For example, versions of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; are printed in traditional characters, and both &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and &quot;Xinhua&quot; have traditional character versions of their website available, using Big5 encoding. Mainland companies selling products in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan use traditional characters in order to communicate with consumers; the inverse is equally true as well.

Dictionaries published in mainland China generally show both simplified and their traditional counterparts. In digital media, many cultural phenomena imported from Hong Kong and Taiwan into mainland China, such as music videos, karaoke videos, subtitled movies, and subtitled dramas, use traditional Chinese characters.

=== Hong Kong ===
Textbooks, official statements, and newspapers show no signs of moving to simplified Chinese characters, including state-funded media. However, for example, Hong Konger students sometimes opt to write with simplified characters when taking notes or while taking exams, in order to write faster.

It is common for Hong Kongers to learn traditional Chinese characters in school, as well as some simplified characters incidentally, usually by consuming media produced on the mainland. For use on computers, however, people tend to type Chinese characters using an IME with a traditional character set, such as Big5. In Hong Kong, as well as elsewhere, it is common for people to use both sets, due to the ease of conversion between the two sets.

=== Taiwan ===
Simplified characters are not used in any official capacity in Taiwan, including in government and civil publications in Taiwan. However, they are sometimes used in calligraphy and informal handwriting. It is also legal to import and distribute publications printed in simplified characters. Specific simplified forms predating the 20th century are in common use, such as , the first character in the name &quot;Taiwan&quot;, rivalling the orthodox form even in publications and academic contexts.

=== Southeast Asia ===
In Singapore, where Mandarin Chinese is one of the official languages, simplified characters are the official standard and are generally used in most of official publications as well as the government-controlled press. While simplified characters are taught exclusively in schools and are generally used in most of official publications, the government does not officially discourage the use of traditional characters and still allow parents to choose whether to have their child&#x27;s Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters. Traditional characters are widely used by older Singaporeans, and are widespread on billboards, stall menus, and decorations, as well as in newspapers and on television. There is no restriction on the use of traditional characters in mass media, and television programs, books, magazines and music imported from Hong Kong and Taiwan are widely available, almost always using traditional characters. Many shop signs and menus in hawker centres and coffee shops continue to be written with traditional characters.

Chinese is not an official language in Malaysia, but over 90% of ethnic-Chinese students in the country are educated in Chinese schools, which have been teaching in simplified characters since 1981. Traditional characters are also widely used by older people and are likewise widespread on billboards, to a greater extent than in Singapore. Most of Malaysia&#x27;s Chinese-language newspapers compromise by retaining traditional characters in article headlines, but opting to use simplified characters for the bodies of articles. 

In Indonesia, Chinese is not an official language. However, the country is also home to a sizable ethnic-Chinese community, and similarly to Malaysia, ethnic-Chinese students typically receive their education in Chinese-language schools that almost exclusively use simplified characters. Traditional characters are seldom used, typically only for stylistic purposes.

== In education ==
In general, schools in mainland China, Malaysia and Singapore use simplified characters exclusively, while schools in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan use traditional characters exclusively.

Today, simplified Chinese characters predominate among college and university programs teaching Chinese as a foreign language outside of China, such as those in the United States.

=== Mainland China ===
In December 2004, Ministry of Education authorities rejected a proposal from a Beijing Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) political conference member that called for elementary schools to teach traditional Chinese characters in addition to the simplified ones. The conference member pointed out that many, especially young people, have difficulties with traditional Chinese characters; this is especially important in dealing with non-mainland communities such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. The educational authorities did not approve the recommendation, saying that it did not fit in with the &quot;requirements as set out by the law&quot; and it could potentially complicate the curricula. A similar proposal was delivered to the first plenary session of the 11th CPPCC in March 2008.

=== Hong Kong ===
Most, if not all, Chinese-language textbooks in Hong Kong are written in traditional characters. Before 1997, the use of simplified characters was generally discouraged by educators. After 1997, while students are still expected to be proficient and utilize traditional characters in formal settings, they may sometimes adopt a hybrid written form in informal settings to speed up writing.

=== Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia ===
Chinese textbooks in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia are written exclusively in simplified characters, and only simplified characters are taught in school. Traditional characters are usually only taught to those taking up calligraphy as a co-curricular activity or Cantonese as an elective course at school.

=== Chinese as a foreign language ===

The majority of textbooks teaching Chinese are now based on simplified characters and Hanyu Pinyinalthough there are textbooks originating in China which have a traditional version. For practical reasons, universities and schools prepare students who will be able to communicate with mainland China, so their obvious choice is to use simplified characters.

In places where a particular set is not locally entrenched, such as Europe and the United States, instruction is now mostly simplified, as the economic importance of mainland China increases, and also because of the availability of textbooks printed in mainland China. Teachers of international students often recommend learning both systems.

==== Europe ====
In the United Kingdom, universities mainly teach Mandarin Chinese at the undergraduate level using the simplified characters coupled with pinyin. However, they will require the students to learn or be able to recognise the traditional forms if they are studying in Taiwan or Hong Kong (such as taking Cantonese courses). In Australia and New Zealand, schools, universities and TAFEs use predominantly simplified characters.

Russia and most East European nations are traditionally oriented on the education of the PRC&#x27;s system for teaching Chinese, which uses simplified characters but exposes the learners to both systems.

==== East Asia ====
In South Korea, universities have used predominantly simplified characters since the 1990s. In high school, Chinese is one of the selective subjects. By the regulation of the national curricula standards, bopomofo and traditional characters had been originally used before (since the 1940s), but by the change of regulation, pinyin and simplified characters have been used to pupils who enter the school in 1996 or later. Therefore, bopomofo and traditional characters disappeared after 1998 in South Korean high school Chinese curriculum.

In Japan there are two types of schools. Simplified Chinese is taught instead of traditional Chinese in pro-mainland China schools. They also teach Pinyin, a romanization system for standard Chinese, while the Taiwan-oriented schools teach bopomofo, which uses phonetic symbols. However, the Taiwan-oriented schools are starting to teach simplified Chinese and pinyin to offer a more well-rounded education.

==== Southeast Asia ====
In the Philippines, the use of simplified characters has become increasingly popular. Before the 1970s, Chinese schools in the Philippines were under the supervision of the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China. Hence, most books were using traditional characters. Traditional characters remained prevalent until the early 2000s. Institutions like the Confucius Institute, being the cultural arm of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, are strong proponents of the use of simplified characters. Also, many schools are now importing their Mandarin textbooks from Singapore instead of Taiwan.

Public universities such as the Linguistics and Asian Languages Department of the University of the Philippines use simplified characters in their teaching materials. On the other hand, private schools such as Chiang Kai Shek College and Saint Jude Catholic School remain major proponents of the usage of traditional characters. Some private universities, such as the Ateneo de Manila University, also use simplified characters.

== Use with computers ==
In computer text applications, the GB encoding scheme most often renders simplified Chinese characters, while Big5 most often renders traditional characters. Although neither encoding has an explicit connection with a specific character set, the lack of a one-to-one mapping between the simplified and traditional sets established a de facto linkage.

Since simplified Chinese conflated many characters into one and since the initial version of the GB encoding scheme, known as GB 2312-80, contained only one code point for each character, it is impossible to use GB 2312 to map to the bigger set of traditional characters. It is theoretically possible to use Big5 code to map to the smaller set of simplified character glyphs, although there is little market for such a product. Newer and alternative forms of GB have support for traditional characters. In particular, mainland authorities have now established GB 18030 as the official encoding standard for use in all mainland software publications. The encoding contains all East Asian characters included in Unicode 3.0. As such, GB 18030 encoding contains both simplified and traditional characters found in Big-5 and GB, as well as all characters found in Japanese and Korean encodings.

Unicode deals with the issue of simplified and traditional characters as part of the project of Han unification by including code points for each. This was rendered necessary by the fact that the linkage between simplified characters and traditional characters is not one-to-one. While this means that a Unicode system can display both simplified and traditional characters, it also means that different localisation files are needed for each type.

In font filenames and descriptions, the acronym SC is used to signify the use of simplified Chinese characters to differentiate fonts that use TC for traditional characters.

=== Internet usage ===
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)&#x27;s Internationalization working group recommends the use of the language tag as a language attribute value and Content-Language value to specify web-page content in simplified Chinese characters.

== Criticism ==

Author Liu Shahe was an outspoken critic of the simplification of Chinese characters. He wrote a dedicated column entitled &quot;Simplified Characters are Unreasonable&quot; in the Chinese edition of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

<text>Occidental Mindoro (), officially the Province of Occidental Mindoro ( or &quot;Lalawigan ng Occidental Mindoro&quot;), is a province in the Philippines located in the Mimaropa region. The province occupies the western half of the island of Mindoro. Its capital is Mamburao, but the most populous municipality is San Jose. Sablayan is its largest municipality in terms of area, occupying almost half of the entire province. As of 2020, Occidental Mindoro has 525,354 inhabitants.

The province is bordered on the east by the province of Oriental Mindoro, and on the south by the Mindoro Strait. The South China Sea is to the west of the province and Palawan is located to the southwest, across the Mindoro Strait. Batangas is to the north, separated by the Verde Island Passage, a protected marine area and the center of the world&#x27;s marine biodiversity.

==History==
===Early history===
Mindoro Island was originally known to the ancients as &quot;Ma-i&quot;. It was formally called &quot;Mait&quot;, and known to the Chinese traders before the coming of the Spanish. Its existence was mentioned in the old Chinese chronicles in 775 A.D. and more elaborately in 1225. It was a major anchorage in the Southeast Asia trade route during the pre-Philippines period. Chinese, Arab and Indian merchants traded with the natives.

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1570, the Spanish began to explore the island and named it &quot;Mina de Oro&quot; (&quot;mine of gold&quot;) after finding some of the precious metal, though no major gold discoveries were ever made.

The natives of Mindoro were called &quot;Manguianes&quot; by the Spaniards. But the natives refer to themselves by their ethnic or clan identification. There were seven such ethnic or clan distinctions, which are differentiated by language and areas where each can be found.

The Mangyans, as they are now anthropologically known, do not have a warrior society. They are a peaceful, shy but friendly people. They are rarely known to be hostile, and have had no significant record of violent conflict with other people in the entire history of the province. They grow root crops in forest clearings (slash and burn farms), and hunt wild animals in the forest for their meat needs.

There are no authentic documents in existence explaining the original stock of the Mangyan people, but later theoreticians postulate that they migrated from Indonesia before 775 A.D. They hopped from island to island, until finally settling down permanently in Mindoro. It appeared that clan settlements existed in the North as well as in the southern ends of the island. By 779, the southwest coast of the island was already a known trading center, and its fine natural harbor frequented by Arab, Indian and Chinese maritime traders who plied the route. But there was no attempt of subjugation, just trading.

The first semblance of a political system in Mindoro&#x27;s experience was provided by China in the 13th century. Chinese imperial forces under Admiral Cheng Ho with a powerful armada of 60 war junks visited Mindoro and other parts of the archipelago in the 13th century, with the purpose of gaining more trading favors for Chinese merchants.

For a time, Admiral Ho tried to exert some effort of rule as a prelude to Sino annexation. Internal trouble in the Chinese home front, however, recalled the armada, and the attempts of the empire to annex the archipelago did not materialize.

Some time after the Ho overture, Islamic influence reached the island, probably, through Suluanons who traded with the natives. Moslem peoples, possibly - Orang Dampuans (economic refugees from Sulu) crossed Mindoro Strait from Paragua (now Palawan) and settled along the coastal areas, developing progressive maritime communities.

In 1572, Captain Juan de Salcedo of the Spanish expeditionary army set sail from Cebu and explored the west coast of the island, encountering the Mangyans, who appeared used to seeing foreigners and were not at all a bit surprised at their arrival. On the contrary, it was Salcedo and Martin de Goiti who were surprised to see cross designs on the clothing and basketwork of the natives, and thought some early Christian missionary had been there before them. But later scholars believed the design was Indic in origin and had no religious meaning.

The Spaniards also encountered Moro settlers in Lubang Island that were vassals of and paid tribute to the kingdom of Maynila in the North, under Rajah Sulayman. This was the first real political system in the island. The Moros, who apparently had heard of the invaders from their kinsmen in the south, engaged the small Spanish force who landed on their shore, but the Spaniards&#x27; arquebuses and cannon fire from the ships hoved-to broadside to the island took the field. The Moros fled to the hills, and Salcedo burned their village.

After the defeat of Sulaiman in the same year, Mindoro and other vassal states of Maynila became subject of Castillan rule. The island was officially referred to from then on as &quot;Mina de Oro&quot; (Mine of Gold), compressed later on into Mindoro. The free land name, Ma-i, fell into disuse. The Spanish-Moro war would rage on in Mindoro until toward the end of the Spanish regime in the 19th century.

In 1602, Moro forces plundered the most important Spanish towns along the coasts of Mindoro and Southern Luzon, and subsequently reestablished their hold in Mindoro by constructing a fort at Mamburao. From 1720 onwards, Moro raids became devastating not only to the island&#x27;s Hispanized communities but to other parts of the archipelago as well.

In 1757, the Moros, more particularly, the Iranuns (a relative of the Maranaws of the Lake Lanao regions) organized a war fleet of 74 fast native ships called &quot;prahus&quot;. They destroyed several settlements in the island, carrying off their inhabitants to be sold as slaves in Jolo.

The fact that a Moro fort at Mamburao threatened Manila, the capital of the colonial government, embarrassed the conquerors in the eyes of their native subjects, which was politically intolerable to the Spanish administrators. So in 1766, the Spaniards gathered a large force of 1,200 marines, augmented by a large army of native mercenaries, and burned the Iranun fort. But the Moros simply faded into the hills to escape, and came back when the counter-raid was over and the raiders returned to Manila.

The Moros not only plundered goods, but also took prisoners of war which they sold as slaves. Many Islamic leaders in Mindanao, in spite of the peace settlement with the Spaniards contained in treaties and formal agreements, supported piratical raids with arms, ammunition and food, not only because it was a patriotic act (defending Moroland), but this patriotism was also giving them handsome profits. They received part of the &quot;prisoners of war&quot; when a successful raider returned, which earned them huge amounts.

Most of the raids were successful because of the fast watercraft in the employ of the raiders. It was not until the commission of the &quot;vapor,&quot; fast steamships, in the mid-18th century that the Spanish navy successfully patrolled the archipelagic waters, and fared well against the wind-powered native seacraft of the pirates. Many pirate fleets were sunk at sea, or confined to their hiding places.

The invention of machines during the Industrial Revolution, which gradually replaced manual labor, and the consecutive abolitions of slave ownership in many liberalized countries, caused a great decline in the demand for slave labor. Many of the pirate markets closed, and prices fell severely for captives.

With losses to the Spanish navy increasing, and the eventual fall in profits from slave selling, raiding became less appealing to the Iranuns and their Islamic supporters. Uneconomical patriotism simply did not make quite an appeal. Thus, it came to pass that the Moro pirates faded from Mindoro&#x27;s history. The pirate fort in Mamburao was abandoned, and the Moros retreated to Mindanao to consolidate their forces and continue the Moslem resistance at the homefront. Mindoro Island then became a Spanish possession in a truer sense for the first time. But not for long.

In 1896, the Philippine Revolution begun, which spread throughout the islands. In 1897, the Spaniards posted a rifle company of 140 troops and 51 marines to Calapan to secure the island from the forces of General Emilio Aguinaldo and his revolutionary army, then beginning to overrun Spanish positions in the archipelago. Only Mindoro was relatively safe. In 1898, the revolutionaries attacked and overwhelmed the settlement that is now Bongabong. The revolution also ignited in the western part (Occidental Mindoro), which seized control of the settlements there from the Spaniards. Finally, they marched against the capital of Calapan with some 1,000 ill-armed foot soldiers.

The attack came to nothing. The Spanish defenses held. It was only the arrival of 1,000 regular army troops with artillery, all under the command of General Malvar in Batangas, that compelled the surrender of the Spaniards under Governor Morales. Hence on July 1, 1898, the Spanish rule in Mindoro Island, lasting for 328 years, ended.

===American invasion era===
A new battalion &quot;Mindoro&quot;, with two rifle companies, was formed under the command of Captain Ruperto Hernandez and Estanislao Cayton, both from Batangas. The revolutionary political reins were held by the elite, who also held the same reins under the Spaniards (and later under the Americans). The revolution, therefore, was for liberation against colonial rule but not a war for social change, which was to be defeated late in the US-Filipino war that followed.

In 1910, the successor United States politico-military administration granted over of land to the Welch and Fargo Sugar Company in what is now San Jose, which built the first modern and biggest sugar mill in the Far East at Siete Central (now barangay Central). In the same year, the boldly developing community of sugar cane planters, mill workers, company professionals and businessmen enabled the creation of San Jose as an official Philippine town.

===Philippine independence===
In 1950, the province of Mindoro was divided into Oriental Mindoro and Occidental Mindoro by virtue of Republic Act No. 505.

===Contemporary history===
In April 2023, the provincial government placed the entire province under a state of calamity due to the 20-hour daily power outage that has been occurring for a month and a half.

==Geography==
Occidental Mindoro covers a total area of occupying the western section of the Mindoro island, and includes outlying islands in the northwest.

General land surface features that characterize Occidental Mindoro are mountains, rivers, hills, valleys, wide plains and some small fresh water lakes. The taller mountains can be found in the interior that it shares with Oriental Mindoro. 
Mountain ranges converge on the two central peaks, Mount Halcon in the north, and Mount Baco in the south. There is also a mountain known as &quot;bundok ng susong dalaga&quot;, the &quot;Maiden&#x27;s breast mountain&quot;, that looks like a reclined woman.

The northern part of the province has relatively fewer plains, while the southern parts have wider flatlands. Most of the plains are cultivated fields, with few remaining untouched forests. Significant hilly areas can be found rolling off in Santa Cruz in the north, and in San Jose and Magsaysay in the south. These are grassed-over rather than forested.

There are several major drainage or river systems flowing on a generally westerly course: , Pagbahan, Mompong, Biga, Lumintao, Busuanga and Caguray. Swamp areas are restricted to the south, specially, along the river mouths.

The province is also home to one of the most popular coral reefs in the Philippines, Apo Reef.

===Climate===
Occidental Mindoro has two distinct weather types: rainy season and dry season. Rains begin to fall in the province in late May, intensifying through June, July, August, September and October, then gradually subsides in November. The months of August and September are the wettest period, with storms directly passing through the area.

On the other hand, dry season starts in November, with rainfall subsiding in intensity, and altogether ceasing in January, February, March and April. March and April are the driest period, with cloudless skies and parched earth characterizing the general area.

Temperature range is from in the windy uplands to in the lowlands.

===Administrative divisions===
Occidental Mindoro comprises 11 municipalities and 2 legislative districts.


==Demographics==
The population of Occidental Mindoro in the 2020 census was 525,354 people, with a density of .

The indigenous people in the province are the Mangyans (&quot;Manguianes&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Mañguianes&quot; in Old Tagalog), consisting of 7 distinct tribes. They occupy the foothills and interior. The Mangyan have inhabited the island since pre-history. They are believed to have originally traveled from Indonesia and settled down for good in the island.

There is much evidence, historical and geophysical, that the Mangyan tribes formerly lived near the coastlines. They were compelled, however, to move into the interior jungles of the island when the inter-island immigrants came, in order to avoid confrontations, which the peace-loving tribes wished to avoid at all costs. They also wished to avoid cultural changes and to preserve their way of life.

Today, the Mangyan number to only around 80,000 (freely moving in and out in both provinces of Oriental and Occidental Mindoro). But there is no accurate accounting of them since many still live elusively in the upper regions of the island, avoiding contact with lowlanders.

===Languages===
Major languages spoken are Tagalog and the Mangyan languages. Tagalog is usually spoken with Batangas dialect both due to its geographical contact with Batangas and Batangueño residents in the province, with great influences from native Mangyan and Visayan languages. Ilocano, Visayan, and Bicolano, are varyingly spoken by people who migrated from the provinces where they are spoken. Occidental Mindoro is a cultural melting pot, populated mostly by recent immigrants.

===Religion===
Like the Eastern half of the island, most of the population of Occidental Mindoro are of Roman Catholic conviction (82%) while minor religions are usually represented by various Christian denominations, Islam, indigenous Philippine folk religions, animism, and atheism.

==Economy==

Occidental Mindoro is an agricultural area devoted to the production of food. Its economic base is rice production (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot; culture), a Philippine staple crop. It is the leading activity and source of seasonal employment in the province, participated in by almost 80 per cent of the population, including children.

Wetland or lowland rice is a rainy season crop, heavily dependent on water and therefore produced from July (planting season) to October (harvest season). Tobacco, onions, garlic and vegetables are grown during the dry season (November to May) since they are not water-intensive crops, and require longer photoperiodicity.

Rice, corn, onions, garlic, salt, fishes (both wild and cultured) are some of the relatively significant surpluses produced in the province in exportable quantities. Mangoes, cashew nuts, cooking bananas (&quot;saba&quot;) and some other fruits grown in upland orchards are among the other exports of Occidental Mindoro that have traditionally contributed to its income. Peanuts are also grown in some parts of the province, as well as cassava, sweet potatoes, ginger and other minor cultivars.

Forest resources include timber and minerals, among them gold, copper, silver, chrome, and non-metallic minerals such as lime for making cement, and greenstones for ornaments. Timber groups include many species of hardwoods, such as mahogany, and other types of trees in high demand for durability.

There is no large industry in the province. The government is the biggest employer, absorbing most of the off-farm labor force. The local electric cooperative, Occidental Mindoro Electric Cooperative (OMECO), is the biggest employer in the private sector, with nearly 150 regular employees. The rest of the population is engaged in private trades.

===Problems ===
There are many multi-faceted problems in Occidental Mindoro&#x27;s economy. In rice farming, the biggest issue confronting the producers is the high cost of production. This is attributed mainly to the spiraling prices of farm inputs. A study concluded that from 1997 to 2003, the cost of production rose by 47 per cent, while the income derived from marketing rice maintained 1997 levels. There are also confused reports that the average production rate has declined due to the reduced application of necessary farm chemicals. In street language, this means that the farmers simply cut the amount of inputs because they cannot afford the high capital requirements of following all the recommended inputs in the farming calendar.

Another structural problem is the inadequacy of irrigation. Most of the river systems in the province no longer have the demanded volume of water to make irrigation feasible. This is attributed to the greatly deforested watersheds.

<text>The Westgate Las Vegas Resort &amp; Casino is a hotel, casino, and timeshare resort in Winchester, Nevada. Located near the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip, it is owned by Westgate Resorts. It opened in 1969 as the International Hotel, and was known for many years as the Las Vegas Hilton, then briefly as the LVH – Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. From 1981 to 1990, it was the largest hotel in the world.

==Facilities==
The Westgate is located on a site on the east side of Paradise Road, approximately east of Las Vegas Boulevard. It is adjacent to the Las Vegas Convention Center to the south and Las Vegas Country Club to the east.

The hotel has 2,956 rooms. The hotel tower is tall, with 30 floors. The top floor consists of three &quot;Sky Villas&quot; geared towards &quot;high roller&quot; customers, each with a private swimming pool and at least of space.

The casino has of gaming space as of 2017, with 576 slot machines, 38 table games, 10 poker tables, and a race and sports book. The casino&#x27;s sportsbook, the SuperBook, is billed as the largest in the world.

The Westgate has various eateries, including fine dining restaurants, a buffet, and a food court. Benihana Village, opened in 1974, is a Japanese-themed area with streams and gardens, with several restaurants centered around its namesake teppanyaki grill.

The Westgate&#x27;s convention center has of event space, including the Paradise Event Center (formerly the Hilton Center) and the Pavilion (formerly the Hilton Pavilion).

Recreation amenities at the Westgate include a pool deck, a fitness center, a spa, and six tennis courts. The hotel also has several retail shops, a wedding chapel, and a business center.

The Westgate station of the Las Vegas Monorail is located at the front of the property.

==History==
===International Hotel (1969–1971)===
The hotel site was previously part of the grounds of Las Vegas Park, a defunct racetrack. In 1965, the track site was purchased by National Equities, a real estate development firm chaired by Marvin Kratter. Kratter announced development plans for the site to include a 40-floor, 1,500-room hotel, as well as a golf course and private homes.

Meanwhile, Kirk Kerkorian, the chairman of Trans International Airlines and landlord of Caesars Palace, began formulating plans to build a 1,000-room casino hotel in Las Vegas. After considering several potential locations, he selected the racetrack site, reasoning that it was natural to put a hotel next to the Convention Center. Kratter had decided not to build a hotel himself, and in 1967, National Equities sold a portion of the site to Kerkorian for $5 million. Kerkorian announced that he would build a 30-story hotel with 1,510 rooms, at a cost of $50 million. Some believed it was very risky to build such a property away from the Strip, but Kerkorian believed that it would spark the development of a &quot;second Strip&quot; along Paradise Road.

Kerkorian&#x27;s hotel would be named the International Hotel, matching the name of Kratter&#x27;s International Country Club (now the Las Vegas Country Club). He hired airline executive Fred Benninger to oversee the development, and Martin Stern Jr., who had designed several noted Las Vegas high-rises, as the hotel&#x27;s architect. The general contractor selected to build the hotel was Taylor Construction Co. Construction began with an elaborate groundbreaking ceremony in February 1968.

With planning for the hotel underway, Kerkorian purchased the Flamingo casino, to serve as a training ground for the International&#x27;s staff. Later, during the International&#x27;s construction, Kerkorian formed the publicly traded company International Leisure to own the two casinos.

Howard Hughes, the eccentric billionaire who had purchased several Las Vegas casinos, saw Kerkorian as a rival and the International as unwelcome competition. He attempted to deter Kerkorian from building the project, first by making a sham announcement of a major planned expansion of his Sands Hotel, and then by conveying false claims to Kerkorian about damage to buildings from nearby nuclear tests. When these ruses failed, Hughes schemed to buy the project from Kerkorian and halt its construction, but this plan came to nothing. Ultimately, Hughes decided to compete head-on with the International by purchasing the unfinished Landmark Hotel and Casino, located across the street. Hughes completed construction of the Landmark and opened it one day before Kerkorian&#x27;s hotel.

The International Hotel opened on July 2, 1969. At the time, it was Nevada&#x27;s tallest building and largest hotel. Entertainment director Bill Miller signed Barbra Streisand to open in the showroom, along with Peggy Lee performing in the hotel&#x27;s lounge.

In keeping with the hotel&#x27;s name, rooms were furnished with different international decors, with each floor featuring either a Spanish, Italian, or French theme. There was also a complex of international restaurants, offering Bavarian, Italian, Japanese and Mexican cuisines. Employees were outfitted in costumes from different cultures, such as Scottish kilts, Slavic shirts, and French gendarme uniforms.

On July 31, 1969, immediately following Streisand&#x27;s engagement, Elvis Presley performed the first show of what would become a seven-year run at the hotel, encompassing 636 consecutive sold-out shows. Many of the performers who worked the International before Presley were upset at their disrupted prospects.

Late in 1969, Kerkorian made plans to raise $29 million through a secondary offering of International Leisure stock. He needed the money to help pay off loans that he had taken out to purchase major stakes in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Western Airlines. The offering was rejected, however, by the Securities and Exchange Commission, because the company was unable to provide five years of financial history for the Flamingo. Short on cash, Kerkorian was forced to put International Leisure up for sale.

===Las Vegas Hilton (1971–2012)===

In 1970 and 1971, Kerkorian sold his shares of International Leisure to Hilton Hotels. The International was renamed the Las Vegas Hilton in July 1971. Hilton took complete ownership in 1972, acquiring all outstanding shares of International Leisure.

The hotel had performed unevenly in its early years as the International, but as the Hilton, it soon came to be regarded as the most successful hotel in Las Vegas.

An east tower extension with 620 rooms was completed in 1975 at a cost of $20 million. In 1977, the hotel opened the Hilton Pavilion, a $7.5-million venue for sports and entertainment events, with a seating capacity of up to 5,000 people. A $23-million expansion added another 644 rooms to the north tower. The general contractor selected to build the expansion was Del E. Webb Corporation. Ground was broken in 1977 and it was completed in 1979.

====1981 fire====
On the night of February 10, 1981, a major fire occurred at the Hilton. Philip Bruce Cline, a hotel busboy who was under the influence of drugs, set fire to a curtain in an elevator lobby on the eighth floor of the east tower. The fire spread to the exterior of the tower and then traveled up to the top of the building within 25 minutes. Eight people were killed, and approximately 350 were injured, including 48 firefighters. Among the victims treated for smoke inhalation was singer Natalie Cole.

The casino and hotel reopened nine days after the fire with 1,000 available rooms. The rest of the rooms were repaired over the following three months, at an estimated cost of $10 million.

Cline was convicted in 1982 of arson and murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Hilton and other companies involved in the hotel paid a $23 million settlement to victims. The tragedy, in combination with the MGM Grand fire that had occurred months earlier, inspired major changes to Nevada&#x27;s fire safety regulations.

====1981–2012====

Around the end of 1981, another extension to the north tower was completed, adding 391 rooms at a cost of $21 million. This made the Las Vegas Hilton the largest hotel in the world, with a total of 3,174 rooms. (The Rossiya Hotel in Moscow had more rooms, but was not deemed to be a larger hotel by the Guinness Book of World Records because many of its rooms were used as dormitories.) It held this title until 1990, when it was surpassed by the Flamingo.

In 1984, the hotel completed construction of the $10-million Hilton Center, a convention and event space at the southwest corner of the property, west of the Hilton Pavilion.

In 1986, amid growing popularity of sports betting in Nevada, the Hilton opened its race and sports book, the Superbook, at a cost of $17 million.

In 1991, the Hilton was at the center of the Tailhook scandal, in which numerous United States Navy officers were accused of acts of sexual assault during a convention at the hotel. One of the victims, Paula Coughlin, sued the Hilton for providing inadequate security for the convention, and eventually was paid a $5.2 million judgment. The lawsuit led Hilton to successfully lobby for the so-called &quot;Tailhook bill&quot;, a state law shielding hotels from liability for injuries to patrons caused by third parties.
The hotel completed a new , $4-million marquee sign in 1994. Later that year, however, it was partially destroyed by a windstorm. The sign was reconstructed in 1997 for $9 million with a reduced height of , making it the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing advertising sign.

In 1994, the hotel entered an arrangement with the Sahara Country Club, which was renamed as the Las Vegas Hilton Country Club. This lasted until 1997, when the course became the Las Vegas National Golf Club. Hilton attempted to buy the neighboring Las Vegas Country Club the following year, but its $60-million offer was rejected.

In 1995, the Hilton completed a $40-million renovation of its penthouse floor to construct the Sky Villas. The hotel also spent $12 million on a new room for baccarat, a favorite game of Asian high rollers. The Hilton at the time was one of only four Las Vegas casinos able to compete for the business of the &quot;whales&quot;, the top tier of high rollers.

In 1998, Hilton spun off its casino properties, including the Las Vegas Hilton, as Park Place Entertainment.

Hilton&#x27;s timeshare arm, Hilton Grand Vacations, began construction of a complex at the northeast corner of the property in 1998. It opened in 1999 with 230 suites.

Around 1999, Park Place began seeking a buyer for the Las Vegas Hilton, because the company hoped to concentrate on its properties on the Las Vegas Strip, especially the newly acquired Caesars Palace. In 2000, Park Place agreed to sell the Hilton to Edward Roski Jr. for $365 million. Roski planned to transform the Hilton to shift its focus away from high rollers and toward convention attendees. The deal fell through, however, and the property was locked up in litigation between Park Place and Roski until 2003, when they settled their claims against each other.

The Las Vegas Monorail opened in 2004, with one of its stations located at the Hilton. The system had been under construction since 2001. Hilton had led the group of hotels that had promulgated the proposal for the monorail as early as 1996.

In June 2004, Caesars Entertainment (formerly Park Place) sold the Las Vegas Hilton to Colony Capital for $280 million. Colony partnered in the purchase with Goldman Sachs, which also lent $200 million of the purchase price. In 2005, the Hilton was placed under the banner of Colony&#x27;s newly formed casino affiliate, Resorts International Holdings, which was headquartered at the property.

The Hilton prospered in its first few years under Colony&#x27;s management, but began losing money in the face of the Great Recession and an oversupply of hotel rooms in Las Vegas. In June 2011, the Hilton began defaulting on payments to Goldman Sachs on the loan. The same month, Hilton Worldwide opted to terminate its franchise agreement with the property, effective at the end of the year, because the facilities had fallen below the standards of the Hilton brand.

Goldman Sachs issued a foreclosure notice in September 2011. At Goldman&#x27;s request, a court appointed a receiver to take control of the property.

===LVH (2012–2014)===
On January 3, 2012, the Las Vegas Hilton became the LVH – Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, as the contract to use the Hilton brand ended.

Colony Capital initially tried to fight against foreclosure of the property, but ultimately concluded that its equity in the LVH was worthless, and agreed to let the foreclosure proceed. Goldman Sachs formed a joint venture with Gramercy Capital to acquire the property. They bought the property at its foreclosure auction in October 2012, where they were the only bidder. The Navegante Group was retained to manage the LVH on their behalf.

In 2013, the LVH affiliated with the Leo Hotel Collection, a network of independent hotels newly created by Red Lion Hotels.

===Westgate Las Vegas (2014–present)===
On June 30, 2014, timeshare developer Westgate Resorts bought the LVH from Goldman and Gramercy for a price between $150 and $170 million. Westgate CEO David Siegel was hoisted to the top of the hotel&#x27;s sign the following day to begin removing the letters &quot;LVH&quot; to make way for the property&#x27;s new name, Westgate Las Vegas. Siegel stated that the company would spend at least $160 million on renovations, and that it would begin converting hotel rooms into timeshare units. According to Siegel, the timeshare conversion would take 15 to 20 years, and, even after its completion, at least 30 percent of the units would remain available as hotel rooms at any given time.

Westgate retained Paragon Gaming to replace Navegante as the property&#x27;s manager in 2015. In 2020, GVII LLC, a company formed by former gaming regulator Mark Lipparelli, replaced Paragon as the casino manager.

In 2023, a tunnel was drilled to the resort for a future Las Vegas Convention Center Loop underground Tesla shuttle service station.

==Architecture==
Martin Stern designed the hotel in the International Style of architecture. Architect Stefan Al described the building&#x27;s aesthetics as a milestone in the corporatization of Las Vegas: &quot;Characterized by its rectilinear forms and bare surfaces, stripped of ornamentation, this elite form of architecture stood miles away from the Mafia-tainted neon of existing casinos.&quot; Architecture critic Alan Hess also noted the simplicity of the International (and the nearby Landmark Hotel) in comparison to older casinos: &quot;As singular, self-contained forms, they showed none of the complexity of the different pieces and sequential additions that made the original Strip visually and urbanistically richer.&quot;
The Y-shaped plan for the hotel tower was inspired by the UNESCO Headquarters building; it was chosen to maximize the number of rooms that could be fit into a square plot while allowing each room to have a satisfactory view. This design was imitated by later Las Vegas hotels such as the Mirage, Mandalay Bay, and Venetian.

The International has been cited as the first Las Vegas &quot;megaresort&quot; (though that distinction is often instead credited to the Mirage, opened in 1989). It was the first to house all of the hotel&#x27;s functions in a single large structure, whereas earlier casinos had housed them in separate buildings. The design of the property, along with the next Kerkorian/Stern project, the original MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, had a major influence on the development of the modern casino resort. As gaming historian David G. Schwartz describes it:

==Entertainment==
===International Theater===

The property&#x27;s main entertainment venue is the 1,607-seat International Theater. Since 2018, the theater hosts Barry Manilow&#x27;s residency show, &quot;The Hits Come Home&quot;.

From the opening of the hotel in 1969, the main showroom was a &quot;star policy&quot; venue, meaning that popular musical artists and comedians were booked to perform for two to four weeks at a time. The typical schedule comprised two shows per night: a dinner show at 8pm and a cocktail show at midnight.

One of the most famous engagements at the hotel was that of singer and pianist Liberace. A longtime mainstay of Las Vegas showrooms, Liberace debuted at the Hilton in 1972, and began appearing regularly in 1973. He performed in the showroom for as many as 17 weeks out of the year, earning as much as $175,000 per week. Liberace&#x27;s shows were known for his flamboyant costumes and for his being driven onstage in a Rolls-Royce limousine. He appeared at the Hilton as late as 1982. Hilton chairman Barron Hilton remembered Liberace as &quot;one of the most popular entertainers ever to grace the stage of the Las Vegas Hilton showroom.&quot;

In 1982, the production show &quot;Bal du Moulin Rouge&quot; opened in the theater, featuring a cast of acrobats, dancers, and variety acts. The show centered around a 45-minute slot for a headline performer, which was filled at times by Suzanne Somers, Charo, and others. Shifting to a production show was intended to reduce the Hilton&#x27;s entertainment costs by avoiding the need to book bigger stars, whose salaries had been spiraling ever higher. The show closed in 1986, and the theater returned to star policy.

Singer Wayne Newton, another longtime Las Vegas star, headlined the Hilton showroom from 1987 to 1993. By the end of his run, he was performing there twenty weeks out of the year, and was described as the highest-paid entertainer on the Las Vegas Strip. Newton&#x27;s shows were known for beginning with him descending onto the stage in a spaceship amid a laser show. He made over 950 performances in total.

In 1993, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical &quot;Starlight Express&quot; opened in the main theater. The Hilton Showroom was renamed as the Hilton Theatre, and underwent a $12-million renovation to add bridges and embankments to accommodate the show, which features performers on roller skates. The opening of the show was cited as part of a trend in Las Vegas toward family-friendly attractions and away from individual headliner acts. The show was signed to a five-year contract, but closed early in 1997 amid lagging ticket sales. The hotel then adopted a &quot;limited star policy&quot; for the theater, booking headline acts for runs of less than a week at a time.

In the early 2000s, the theater kept a rotating stable of headliners who each performed for ten weeks out of the year, including at times The Commodores, The Righteous Brothers, Sheena Easton, The Fab Four, Engelbert Humperdinck, and The Smothers Brothers.

Manilow began an extended run at the Hilton in 2005. His engagement was an early example of the trend of major recording artists establishing residency shows in Las Vegas, which was begun by Celine Dion at Caesars Palace in 2003. His show began as &quot;Manilow: Music and Passion&quot;, and was then revamped in 2008 as &quot;Ultimate Manilow: The Hits&quot;. The show ended in 2009. In November 2018, Paula Abdul revealed she was initially offered to do a show in the International Theater in 2005 but felt she wasn&#x27;t the right artist to perform in it as it was “so special and magical”, so she told Hilton Hotels to offer it to Manilow.

During the summer of 2006, Reba McEntire performed her residency show, &quot;Reba: Key to the Heart&quot;, which ran for five non-consecutive weeks.

The &quot;$250,000 Game Show Spectacular&quot; ran from October 2007 to April 2008. The show rotated through three hosts: creator Bob Eubanks, Chuck Woolery, and Jamie Farr. A temporary &quot;American TV Game Show Hall of Fame&quot; opened and closed on site in conjunction with the show, inducting Peter Marshall, Hugh Downs, Wink Martindale, and Monty Hall. The concept was originated by entertainment publicist Jerry Digney. The logo was designed by Dan Acree.

Recent long-running shows in the theater include the classic rock tribute show &quot;Raiding the Rock Vault&quot;, from 2013 to 2014, and the Prince tribute show &quot;Purple Reign&quot;, from 2016 to 2017.

===Westgate Cabaret===
Smaller shows are hosted in the 400-seat Westgate Cabaret. This venue hosts magician Jen Kramer (since 2018), Motown tribute act &quot;Soul of Motown&quot; (since 2019), and the comedy night Comedy Cabaret (since 2023).

Starting in the 1990s, the venue was known as The NightClub. Combining elements of a dance club and a traditional Las Vegas lounge, it helped pave the way for dance clubs to open in many Las Vegas casinos.

The NightClub was renamed as the Shimmer Cabaret in 2004 when the Hilton came under the ownership of Colony Capital. Long-running acts at the Shimmer Cabaret included comedian David Brenner (2004–05),
musical comedies &quot;Menopause the Musical&quot; (2006–09)
and &quot;Nunsense&quot; (2010–13),
show band The Scintas (2007–09),
singer Lani Misalucha (2009–10),
topless revue &quot;Sin City Bad Girls&quot; (2009–10),
impressionists Greg London (2011–12)
and Rich Little (2012–13),
a Rat Pack tribute show led by Sandy Hackett (2011–13),
&quot;Purple Reign&quot; (2014–16),
and the &quot;Icons of Comedy&quot; series (2011–12), featuring comedians such as Gilbert Gottfried and Hal Sparks.

In 2015, after the hotel was purchased by Westgate, the room was given its current name. Previous productions and headliners at the Westgate Cabaret include the adult revue &quot;Sexxy&quot; (2015–21), funk band Cameo and comedian Vinnie Favorito, (both 2016–17), comedian George Wallace (2018–21), and rock band The Bronx Wanderers (2021–22)
===Star Trek: The Experience===

In January 1998, Star Trek: The Experience opened, featuring a motion simulator ride, a museum, and Quark&#x27;s Bar. A portion of the casino floor was transformed into the SpaceQuest Casino, a space-themed casino complete with high-tech table games, which served as the gateway to the Experience.

In March 2004, a new Borg Invasion 4D ride was added.

The attraction closed in September 2008, after the operator, Cedar Fair, could not agree on terms for a renewed lease with the Hilton.

===Elvis performances and legacy===

Elvis Presley was signed for a four-week engagement in 1969 as the second performer to appear in the International&#x27;s showroom, following Barbra Streisand. It would be his first public stage appearance in eight years. Presley&#x27;s first show proved so popular that the hotel immediately signed him to a five-year contract for two month-long engagements per year. He would go on to perform a total of 636 shows at the hotel from 1969 to 1976, with every show sold out. Presley&#x27;s run of performances at the Hilton was cut short by his death in August 1977.

During his engagements at the hotel, Presley famously resided in the Imperial Suite on the 30th floor. Years after his death, the suite was renamed as the Elvis Presley Suite. It was demolished in 1994 to make way for the Sky Villas.

Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, lived at the Hilton for several years after Presley&#x27;s death, and was a fixture at the hotel as an entertainment consultant for much of the remainder of his life.
The hotel has recognized and capitalized on Presley&#x27;s legacy in assorted ways through the years. A year after his death, a bronze statue of Presley was unveiled at the hotel; it has since occupied various spots around the property. Various festivals and conventions for Elvis fans and impersonators have been held at the hotel.

&quot;Elvis: An American Musical&quot;, a multimedia production incorporating archival footage with live songs and re-enactments, premiered at the Hilton showroom in 1988, where it ran for two months before going on a national tour. Elvis impersonator Trent Carlini performed at the Hilton in various runs, both on the main stage and in the cabaret, from 2000 to 2004 and again from 2010 to 2015.

&quot;Elvis: The Exhibition&quot; opened at the Westgate in April 2015 in the former Star Trek attraction space. The exhibit, developed in association with Elvis Presley Enterprises, featured of artifacts and memorabilia from the singer&#x27;s life. In conjunction with the opening of the exhibit, the hotel&#x27;s theater was renamed as the Elvis Presley International Showroom, and was set to feature rotating shows inspired by Presley, starting with &quot;The Elvis Experience&quot;. The show fared poorly in its two-month run, however, and the plans for further shows did not materialize. The exhibition closed suddenly in February 2016, leading to a protracted legal dispute.

In 2016, the Westgate successfully petitioned to rename the street leading from the hotel to Las Vegas Boulevard as Elvis Presley Boulevard.

==Sporting events==
===Boxing===
The hotel has a history as a prominent professional boxing venue. In 1969, the showroom hosted the first major boxing match held at a Las Vegas hotel, Sonny Liston vs. Leotis Martin (previous fights had been held at the Convention Center). The Hilton Pavilion was the site in 1978 of Leon Spinks&#x27;s victory over Muhammad Ali for the world heavyweight championship, which is remembered as one of the biggest upsets in the sport&#x27;s history. The hotel then took a seven-year hiatus from hosting boxing matches.

In 1985, Donald Curry defeated Milton McCrory at the Hilton Center to unify and become the undisputed welterweight champion. The success of the Curry–McCrory fight led the Hilton to begin pursuing more major matches, to challenge Caesars Palace as the premier boxing venue in Las Vegas. The hotel struck a deal to host several fights in the heavyweight unification series, a tournament to establish an undisputed heavyweight champion. A 14,600-seat outdoor arena was temporarily erected in the Hilton&#x27;s parking lot for some of the fights. The series culminated in Mike Tyson&#x27;s defeat of Tony Tucker at the Hilton Center in 1987 to unify and become the undisputed champion.

By 1995, the Hilton had reportedly backed away from seeking to host the biggest fights, because of escalating costs. The hotel hosted no boxing matches between 2002 and 2008; since then, it has occasionally hosted minor fights.

===Other sports===
The Hilton Pavilion hosted two nationally televised tennis events in 1978: the WCT Tournament of Champions and the World Team Tennis All-Star Match.

The hotel was the venue for Evo 2014, a major competitive video gaming tournament.

<text>The Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) is an intercollegiate athletic conference that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. Of its 15 member schools, all but one are located in Virginia; the other full member is in North Carolina. The conference also has two associate members: one in Virginia and one in North Carolina.

==History==


The conference was founded in May 1975 as the Virginia College Conference. On January 1, 1976, the name was changed to the Old Dominion Athletic Conference. The 1976–77 season was the first in which championships were offered. In 1980, Maryville College joined and became the first member outside of Virginia. In 1981, Catholic University joined the conference after leaving Division I&#x27;s ECAC South Conference. In 1982–83, women&#x27;s sports were added, and Hollins College (now university), Randolph–Macon Woman&#x27;s College (now Randolph College), and Sweet Briar College all joined. Mary Baldwin College (now university) joined in 1984. In 1988, Maryville left and was replaced by Virginia Wesleyan College (now university). In 1989 Catholic left the conference to become a charter member of the Capital Athletic Conference, returning in 1999 as a football-only member. They were replaced by Guilford College two years later. The next school to leave the conference was Mary Baldwin, which left in 1992.

In 2010 the ODAC announced the addition of Shenandoah University as a full-time member, with its first full year of involvement during the 2012–13 academic year.

The league office moved its physical location from Salem, to Forest in eastern Bedford County located just outside centrally located Lynchburg, Virginia. They also contracted Jim Ward Design for its new marks.

On March 3, 2015, Sweet Briar College announced it was to close (cease operations) at the end of the 2015 summer session. However, on June 20, 2015, the Virginia Attorney General announced a mediation agreement that kept Sweet Briar College open for the 2015–16 academic year. Sweet Briar reactivated its sports teams in the 2015–16 season and remained a full member of the ODAC.

On September 29, 2015, it was announced that Catholic University would withdraw in 2017 as associate member to join the new football league at the New England Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Athletic Conference.

In June 2017, it was announced that Ferrum College would become the 15th full-time member of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference after it moved from the USA South Conference.

Southern Virginia University, which joined the ODAC as a football only member in 2019, announced in December of that year that it was leaving both the ODAC and Coast to Coast Athletic Conference to join the football-sponsoring USA South Athletic Conference as a full member.

The conference has hosted Division III championships in football and men&#x27;s basketball, both of which were held in Salem, Virginia. D-III softball has also used Salem as a championship host along with Division III women&#x27;s lacrosse and volleyball on several occasions. Since 1993 - the conference and city have hosted over 80 Division III national championships.

It was announced on November 17, 2020, that Emory &amp; Henry College, later a university, would leave the ODAC and begin its transition to Division II in July 2021 and compete in the South Atlantic Conference in 2022.

The most recent change in conference membership was announced on March 8, 2021, that Averett University would leave the USA South and join its former USA South counterpart Ferrum College in the ODAC as a full member in 2022.

<doc id="261955" wikidata="Q223649" url="?curid=261955" title="Tugela Falls">
<text>Tugela Falls (uThukela in Zulu) is a complex of seasonal waterfalls located in the Drakensberg (&quot;Dragon&#x27;s Mountains&quot;) of Royal Natal National Park in KwaZulu-Natal Province, Republic of South Africa. According to some measurements, it is the world&#x27;s tallest waterfall. A revisited validation of waterfall measurements is not available and there is still uncertainty whether Tugela or Venezuela&#x27;s Angel Falls is the tallest (both measurements were taken at considerable distance from the two waterfalls).

The combined total drop of its five distinct free-leaping falls is officially . In 2016, however, a Czech scientific expedition took new measurements, making the falls tall. The data were sent to the World Waterfall Database for confirmation. The source of the Tugela River (Zulu for &#x27;sudden&#x27;) is the Mont-Aux-Sources plateau, which extends several kilometres beyond the Amphitheatre escarpment from which the falls drop.

==Height controversy==
There is an argument that Tugela Falls is the tallest waterfall in the world, rather than the more commonly cited Angel Falls. This argument is based on two possible inaccuracies regarding the presumed heights of the respective falls.

First, many now believe that Angel Falls is not as tall as was claimed in the initial survey carried out by American journalist Ruth Robertson in 1949. The quoted figure of corresponds almost precisely with the difference in altitude between the top of the falls and the confluence of the Rio Gauja and the Río Churún, which is roughly away from the base of the Auyan Tepui escarpment and downstream from the last segment of the Rio Gauja that could possibly be considered a ‘waterfall’.

The starting altitude of Angel Falls is often given as , from which the falls plunge a vertical , then proceed to cascade for approximately with relatively little altitude loss, before a final drop of below the Talus Rapids, near the famous viewpoint known as Mirador Laime. After this the Rio Gauja flows with very little altitude loss, with nothing approaching a waterfall or even cascade before it empties into the Río Churún. However, the altitude of Mirador Laime is usually given as approximately , which would suggest that Angel Falls is only about in total height (roughly the height of the first drop).

Angel Falls, however, is almost universally regarded as having the tallest single uninterrupted drop of any waterfall in the world (the total height of Tugela Falls, even though possibly the tallest on Earth, is divided into five smaller tiers, and its tallest individual tier is ). Even this measurement invites some debate, however, as some botanical sources list the height of Angel Falls&#x27; tallest drop as , rather than the usually cited .

==Access==
At the right time of year, the falls are easily visible from the main road into the park, especially after a heavy rain. There is an undeveloped camp site and mountain hut immediately above the falls.

There are two trails to Tugela Falls. The most spectacular trail is to the top of Mont-Aux-Sources, which starts at &quot;The Sentinel&quot; car park (through Phuthaditjhaba on the R57, approximately two hours drive from Royal Natal National Park via the R74, 90 minutes from Harrismith via the R712, or 80 minutes from Golden Gate Highlands National Park). From here it is a relatively easy climb to the top of the Amphitheatre that takes about 4.5 to 8 hours round-trip depending on fitness level. Access to the summit is via two chain ladders. This is the only day hiking trail which leads to the top of the Drakensberg escarpment. Another trail to the foot of Tugela Falls starts at Royal Natal National Park. The easy gradient up the Tugela Gorge winds through indigenous forests. The last part of the hike to Tugela Falls is a boulder hop. A little chain ladder leads over the final stretch for a view of the falls rushing down the amphitheatre in a series of five cascades.

<text>Takakkaw Falls (; also spelled Takkakaw) is a waterfall in Yoho National Park, near Field, British Columbia, in Canada. The falls have a total height of , making them the second tallest waterfall in Canada. The main drop of the waterfall has a height of .

&quot;Takakkaw&quot; translates to &quot;magnificent” in Cree. The falls are fed by the meltwater of the Daly Glacier, which is part of the Waputik Icefield. The glacier keeps the volume of the falls up during the warm summer months, and they are a tourist attraction, particularly in late spring after the heavy snow melts, when the falls are at peak condition.

==Height==
Various sources place the total vertical height of Takakkaw Falls between and .
The waterfall was formerly thought to be the tallest in Canada, but a survey in 1985 found that it is actually shorter than Della Falls on Vancouver Island. The results of that survey also concluded that the main drop of the falls is high.

==In popular culture==
The Takakkaw Falls were featured in the 1995 film &quot;Last of the Dogmen&quot;.

<text>Basaseachic Falls (Spanish: Cascada de Basaseachi) on the Basaseachic River is the second-highest waterfall in Mexico, located in the Parque Nacional Basaseachic (Basaseachic Falls National Park) at Cañón Basaseachic in the Copper Canyon region of northwest Mexico, near Creel, Chihuahua. It is 246 meters (807 ft) tall, second in Mexico only to the Cascada de Piedra Volada (Flying Stone Falls).

Basaseachic Falls is located in the high mountains of the Sierra Madre Occidental, in the Municipality of Ocampo, from Basaseachi community and about west of Chihuahua. It is reached via Federal Highway 16 and its surroundings make up the Basaseachic Falls National Park (Parque Nacional Cascada de Basaseachic).

The waterfall is made by two streams, Arroyo del Durazno and Arroyo de Basaseachic, which merge in the high mountains and then fall down the canyon wall. Past the falls, the stream is called Río Candameña (Candameña River), which is the namesake of the canyon it flows through, Candameña Canyon (Cañón Candameña). The Candameña River is a tributary of the Río Mayo (Mayo River).

Basaseachic Falls was considered the tallest waterfall in México until the measurement in September, 1994 of the Cascada de Piedra Volada. Both of these waterfalls are seasonal, drying up in the Spring and Autumn dry seasons.

<doc id="261964" wikidata="Q522265" url="?curid=261964" title="Sam (text editor)">
<text>Sam is a multi-file text editor based on structural regular expressions. It was originally designed in the early 1980s at Bell Labs by Rob Pike with the help of Ken Thompson and other Unix developers for the Blit windowing terminal running on v9 Unix; it was later ported to other systems. Sam follows a classical modular Unix aesthetic. It is internally simple, its power leveraged by the composability of a small command language and extensibility through shell integration.

==Design and features==
Sam is designed as two synchronous programs: a command interpreter and a mouse-oriented bitmap windowing interface. The interpreter&#x27;s command set is modeled after the UNIX editor ed and may be used to operate the editor from a standard text terminal. By default, however, Sam presents its own graphical user interface (GUI) window, &quot;samterm&quot;, which additionally allows point-and-click operations through pop-up context menus. This two-process structure allowed sam to access files on networked host systems through remote execution of the file-access process while running the windowing interface locally, thereby bypassing latency over slow connections.

Samterm presents windows to files being edited and to a persistent command window which accepts input as sam commands. Most common editing operations are quickly and naturally accomplished with the point-and-click interface, which also functions inside the command window. This latter fact allows commands to be edited (and resubmitted) just as any other text, a function inherited from the DMD 5620 terminal interface.

===Command syntax===
Sam&#x27;s command syntax is formally similar to ed&#x27;s or ex&#x27;s, containing (structural-) regular expression based conditional and loop functions and scope addressing, even sharing some of ed&#x27;s syntax for such functions. But while ed&#x27;s commands are line-oriented, sam&#x27;s are selection-oriented. Selections are contiguous strings of text (which may span multiple lines), and are specified either with the mouse (by &quot;sweeping&quot; it over a region of text) or by a pattern match. Sam&#x27;s commands take such selections as basic—more or less as other Unix tools treat lines; thus, multi-line and sub-line patterns are as naturally handled by Sam as whole-line patterns are by ed, vi, AWK, Perl, etc. This is implemented through a model called &quot;structural regular expressions&quot;, which can recursively apply regular-expression matching to obtain other (sub)selections within a given selection. In this way, sam&#x27;s command set can be applied to substrings that are identified by arbitrarily complex context.

Sam extends its basic text-editing command set to handling of multiple files, providing similar pattern-based conditional and loop commands for filename specification. Any sequence of text-editing commands may be applied as a unit to each such specification.

===Infinite undos===
Sam was one of the first text editors to support &quot;infinite&quot; undo to revert any number of editing errors. This feature, combined with Sam&#x27;s facility to easily edit its own commands and, fundamentally, its small, orthogonal command set (containing only 33 commands), represent the program&#x27;s bias toward a low learning threshold over other more expressive &quot;power editors.&quot;

Sam is the preferred text editor of several eminent programmers. It was the first full screen editor Ken Thompson liked. Sam is the text editor used by Bjarne Stroustrup, Brian Kernighan, Douglas McIlroy and Tom Duff. Others, like Dennis Ritchie, Rob Pike and Russ Cox, have transitioned to acme, an editor with the same command language as sam, but with an assortment of additional features, including mouse chording and automatic tiling of opened files.

The latest version of sam was written as part of the Plan 9 operating system, but there are Microsoft Windows, macOS and X Window System ports available.

<text>The Battle of Fort Stedman, also known as the Battle of Hare&#x27;s Hill, was fought on March 25, 1865, during the final weeks of the American Civil War. The Union Army fortification in the siege lines around Petersburg, Virginia, was attacked in a pre-dawn Confederate assault by troops led by Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon. The attack was the last serious attempt by Confederate troops to break the Siege of Petersburg. After an initial success, Gordon&#x27;s men were driven back by Union troops of the IX Corps commanded by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke.

==Background==

During March 1865, Confederate General Robert E. Lee continued to defend his positions around Petersburg, but his Army was weakened by desertion, disease, and shortage of supplies and he was outnumbered by his Union counterpart, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, by about 125,000 to 50,000, and he asked Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon for advice. Gordon replied that he had three recommendations, in decreasing order of preference: first, offer peace terms to the enemy; second, retreat from Richmond and Petersburg, link up with the Confederate army in North Carolina under General Joseph E. Johnston, jointly defeat Sherman, and then go after Grant; third, fight without delay. An argument ensued, with Lee rejecting the political implications of the first choice and indicating the difficulty of the second, but Gordon left the meeting with the impression that Lee was considering those options. On March 6, however, Gordon was summoned back to headquarters and Lee told him that &quot;there seemed to be but one thing that we could do—fight. To stand still was death. It could only be death if we fought and failed.&quot;

Gordon later wrote in his memoirs that he &quot;labored day and night at this exceedingly grave and discouraging problem, on the proper solution of which depended the commander&#x27;s decision as to when and where he would deliver his last blow for the life of the Confederacy.&quot; He worked on his plans until March 23 and decided to recommend a surprise attack on the Union lines that would force Grant to contract his lines and disrupt his plans to assault the Confederate works (which, unbeknownst to Lee and Gordon, Grant had already ordered for March 29).

Gordon planned a pre-dawn assault from the Confederate stronghold known as Colquitt&#x27;s Salient against Fort Stedman, one of the fortifications in Union lines that encircled Petersburg, named for Griffin A. Stedman, a Union colonel from Connecticut who had been killed in the vicinity in August 1864. It was one of the closest spots to the Confederate works, there were fewer wooden &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; obstructions protecting it, and a supply depot on the U.S. Military Railroad was less than a mile behind the fort. Directly after capturing Fort Stedman and its artillery, Confederate soldiers would move north and south along the Union lines to clear the neighboring fortifications and make way for the main attack, which would lead to the main Union supply base of City Point (also Grant&#x27;s headquarters), ten miles (16 km) northeast where the Appomattox River joins the James River.

The assault force was three divisions of Gordon&#x27;s Second Corps (under Brig. Gen. Clement A. Evans, Maj. Gen. Bryan Grimes, and Brig. Gen. James A. Walker), two brigades from the Fourth Corps division of Maj. Gen. Bushrod R. Johnson (under Brig. Gens. Matt W. Ransom and William H. Wallace) in close support, and two brigades from Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox&#x27;s Third Corps division in reserve. Lee had also ordered the division of Maj. Gen. George Pickett of the First Corps to move from its position north of the James River in time to join the action. This represented almost half of Lee&#x27;s infantry of the Army of Northern Virginia: 11,500 men from Gordon&#x27;s corps and Bushrod Johnson&#x27;s division, 1,700 of Wilcox&#x27;s men nearby, and 6,500 from Pickett moving up. Maj. Gen. W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee&#x27;s cavalry division was designated to exploit the expected infantry breakthrough. Opposing them were the Union IX Corps commanded by Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, defending the first south from the Appomattox River, and manning in Gordon&#x27;s front (from north to south) artillery Batteries IX and X, Fort Stedman, and Batteries XI and XII. Parke&#x27;s 3rd Division, under Brig. Gen. John F. Hartranft, was in reserve behind the lines. While Maj. Gen. George G. Meade was away at City Point with Grant, Parke was the acting commander of the Army of the Potomac, although he would not realize that until after Gordon&#x27;s attack started.

===Confederate attack===
Gordon&#x27;s attack started at 4:15 a.m. Lead parties of sharpshooters and engineers masquerading as deserting soldiers headed out to overwhelm Union pickets and to remove obstructions that would delay the infantry advance. They were followed by three groups of 100 men assigned to storm the Union works and stream back into the Union rear area. These men relied on surprise and speed—they carried unloaded muskets so that no one could accidentally fire and alert the enemy. The main thrust was between Batteries XI and X, with one group moving north for Battery XI and the other two for X and Stedman. The movement achieved complete surprise.
Brevet Brig. Gen. Napoleon B. McLaughlen, the officer responsible for the Fort Stedman sector, heard the sounds of the attack, dressed quickly in the predawn darkness, and rode to Fort Haskell, just to the south of Battery XII, which he found to be ready to defend itself. As he moved north, McLaughlen ordered Battery XII to open fire on Battery XI and ordered a reserve infantry regiment, the 59th Massachusetts, to counterattack, which they did with fixed bayonets, briefly re-capturing Battery XI. Assuming that he had sealed the only breach in the line, McLaughlen rode into Fort Stedman. He recalled, &quot;I crossed the parapet and meeting some men coming over the curtains, whom in the darkness I supposed to be part of the picket, I established them inside the work, giving directions with regard to position and firing, all of which were instantly obeyed.&quot; He suddenly realized that the men he was ordering were Confederates and they realized he was a Union general, capturing him. He was taken back across no man&#x27;s land and surrendered his sword personally to Gordon.

Gordon soon arrived at Fort Stedman and found his attack had so far exceeded his &quot;most sanguine expectations.&quot; Within minutes, Batteries X, XI (Retaken from the 59th Massachusetts), and XII and Fort Stedman had been seized, opening a gap nearly long in the Union line. Confederate artillerists under Lt. Col. Robert M. Stribling used the captured guns in Stedman and Battery X to open up enfilading fire on the entrenchments to the north and south. The attack began having difficulty at Battery IX to the north, where the Union troops formed a battle line and the Confederates were too confused by the maze of trenches to attack it effectively. Gordon turned his attention to the southern flank of his attack and Fort Haskell, against which he launched his division under Clement Evans. The defenders successfully employed canister rounds from three cannons, halting the assault. The Confederate artillery from Colquitt&#x27;s Salient began bombarding Fort Haskell and the Federal field artillery returned fire, along with the massive siege guns in the rear. When the Union flag was knocked down, the Union gunners assumed that it had fallen to the Confederates and opened fire on their own men. Volunteers were found to raise the flag again and four of them were killed before the Federal artillery ceased fire.

Gordon sent a message back to Lee that the attack was going well, but he was unaware of the trouble developing. His three 100-man detachments were wandering around the rear area in confusion and many had stopped to satisfy their hunger with captured Federal rations. The cavalry had not found an avenue through which to advance into the rear. Pickett&#x27;s Division had such difficulty with rail transportation that only three of its four brigades departed on schedule, and they did not arrive until midday, too late to take part in the battle. And the main Union defense force was beginning to mobilize. Parke acted decisively, ordering Hartranft&#x27;s reserve division to close the gap while his reserve artillery under Col. John C. Tidball took up positions on a ridge east of Fort Stedman and began shelling the Confederates.

===Union counterattack===
Hartranft, in the words of historian Noah Andre Trudeau, &quot;was a man possessed. From the instant he received word that Fort Stedman had fallen, Hartranft worked furiously to limit the Confederate penetration and, once that objective has been achieved, to eliminate the pocket.&quot; Finding that Maj. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox, Parke&#x27;s 1st Division commander and a more senior officer, was preparing his headquarters to withdraw, Hartranft was able to convince Willcox to yield tactical command and he organized defensive forces that completely ringed the Confederate penetration by 7:30 a.m., stopping it just short of the military railroad depot, Meade Station. The Union artillery, aware that Confederates occupied the batteries and Fort Stedman, launched punishing fire against them.

Gordon, who was in Fort Stedman, realized his plan had failed when his lead men started returning and reported remarkable Union resistance. With permission from Lee, who had arrived to watch the battle, Gordon scrambled to get his forces back to safety. By 7:45 a.m., 4,000 Union troops under Hartranft were positioned in a semicircle of a mile and a half, ready to counterattack. A messenger arrived with word from Parke to delay the attack while reinforcements came up from the VI Corps, but Hartranft ordered his line to charge, writing afterward that &quot;I saw that the enemy had already commenced to waver, and that success was certain. I, therefore, allowed the line to charge; besides this, it was doubtful whether I could have communicated with the regiments on the flanks in time to countermand the movement.&quot; The retreating Confederates came under Union crossfire, suffering heavy casualties. Their attack had failed. Fort Stedman was recaptured by a squad from the 208th Pennsylvania.

==Aftermath==
A distinguished visitor came close to witnessing the action on March 25. President Abraham Lincoln was conferring with General Grant and a division-size review parade was scheduled nearby for that morning. Because of the Confederate attack, the review was postponed until that afternoon. A Confederate prisoner was amazed to see the general and president so soon after what he considered a massive attack, riding &quot;by us seemingly not the least concerned and as if nothing had happened.&quot; He and his fellow prisoners took note of this self-confidence and &quot;with one accord agreed that our cause was lost.&quot; Lincoln had telegraphed to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton that morning, &quot;Arrived here all safe about 9 P.M. yesterday. No war news ... Robert [Lincoln&#x27;s son, serving as an aide to Grant] just now tells me there was a little rumpus up the line this morning, ending about where it began.&quot;

The attack on Fort Stedman turned out to be a four-hour action with no impact on the Union lines. The Confederate Army was forced to set back its own lines, as the Union attacked further down the front line. To give Gordon&#x27;s attack enough strength to be successful, Lee had weakened his own right flank. The II Corps and VI Corps seized much of the entrenched Confederate picket line southwest of Petersburg, but found the main line still well manned. This Union advance prepared the ground for Grant&#x27;s breakthrough attack in the Third Battle of Petersburg on April 2, 1865.

Union casualties in the Battle of Fort Stedman were 1,044 (72 killed, 450 wounded, 522 missing or captured), Confederate casualties a considerably heavier 4,000 (600 killed, 2,400 wounded, 1,000 missing or captured). But more seriously, the Confederate positions were weakened, and irreplaceable men lost. After the battle, Lee&#x27;s defeat was only a matter of time. His final opportunity to break the Union lines and regain the momentum was gone. The Battle of Fort Stedman was the final offensive action of the Army of Northern Virginia. One week later the Union Army broke the Confederate lines ending the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign. Immediately following was the Appomattox Campaign and the final surrender of Lee&#x27;s army on April 9, 1865.

<text>rio is Plan 9 from Bell Labs&#x27; windowing system. It is well known for making its window management transparent to the application. This allows running rio inside of another window manager.

==History==

rio is the latest in a long series of graphical user interfaces developed at Bell Labs, mostly developed by Rob Pike, the concurrent window system, and the Blit (which predated X).
 was a window system developed for the Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system by Rob Pike. According to its documentation, the system has &quot;little graphical fanciness&quot;, a &quot;fixed user interface&quot;, and depends on a three-button mouse. Like much of the Plan 9 operating system, many operations work by reading and writing to special files.

Because of the limitations stemming from its unusual implementation, has been completely rewritten into its successor rio in recent Plan 9 versions.
=== rio ===

rio was a complete rewrite of 8½ in Alef. Its main change was that it stopped parsing and rewriting graphical commands and let the client write pixels directly. This was done mainly for efficiency. As Alef disappeared due to being too difficult to maintain given the number of people working on Plan 9 at the time, rio was rewritten in C. This was done using the Plan 9 thread library which was inspired by Alef and had most of its features, such as blocking channels for interthread and interprocess communication. Another important change, due more to the environment than to rio per se, is that rio supports full colour, using alpha compositing, whereas 8½ uses bitblt operations.

==Design concepts==
Many of its features embody key Plan 9 design concepts:
* Each window runs in its own private namespace.
* It exports a file system interface to running applications. This interface is the same rio receives from the operating system, so rio can run inside a rio window without any special arrangements. Because the interface uses 9P, rio is network transparent even if it doesn&#x27;t include any network-aware code.
* Windows are treated as completely editable text.

<text>Fracture is the appearance of a crack or complete separation of an object or material into two or more pieces under the action of stress. The fracture of a solid usually occurs due to the development of certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within the solid. If a displacement develops perpendicular to the surface, it is called a normal tensile crack or simply a crack; if a displacement develops tangentially, it is called a shear crack, slip band, or [[dislocation]].

Brittle fractures occur without any apparent deformation before fracture. Ductile fractures occur after visible deformation. Fracture strength, or breaking strength, is the stress when a specimen fails or fractures. The detailed understanding of how a fracture occurs and develops in materials is the object of fracture mechanics.

==Strength==


Fracture strength, also known as breaking strength, is the stress at which a specimen fails via fracture. This is usually determined for a given specimen by a tensile test, which charts the stress–strain curve (see image). The final recorded point is the fracture strength.

Ductile materials have a fracture strength lower than the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), whereas in brittle materials the fracture strength is equivalent to the UTS. If a ductile material reaches its ultimate tensile strength in a load-controlled situation, it will continue to deform, with no additional load application, until it ruptures. However, if the loading is displacement-controlled, the deformation of the material may relieve the load, preventing rupture.

The statistics of fracture in random materials have very intriguing behavior, and was noted by the architects and engineers quite early. Indeed, fracture or breakdown studies might be the oldest physical science studies, which still remain intriguing and very much alive. Leonardo da Vinci, more than 500 years ago, observed that the tensile strengths of nominally identical specimens of iron wire decrease with increasing length of the wires (see e.g., for a recent discussion). Similar observations were made by Galileo Galilei more than 400 years ago. This is the manifestation of the extreme statistics of failure (bigger sample volume can have larger defects due to cumulative fluctuations where failures nucleate and induce lower strength of the sample).

==Types==
There are two types of fractures: brittle and ductile fractures respectively without or with plastic deformation prior to failure.

===Brittle===

In brittle fracture, no apparent plastic deformation takes place before fracture. Brittle fracture typically involves little energy absorption and occurs at high speeds—up to in steel. In most cases brittle fracture will continue even when loading is discontinued.

In brittle crystalline materials, fracture can occur by &quot;cleavage&quot; as the result of tensile stress acting normal to crystallographic planes with low bonding (cleavage planes). In amorphous solids, by contrast, the lack of a crystalline structure results in a conchoidal fracture, with cracks proceeding normal to the applied tension.

The fracture strength (or micro-crack nucleation stress) of a material was first theoretically estimated by Alan Arnold Griffith in 1921:
:formula_1
where: –
:formula_2 is the Young&#x27;s modulus of the material,
:formula_3 is the surface energy, and
:formula_4 is the micro-crack length (or equilibrium distance between atomic centers in a crystalline solid).

On the other hand, a crack introduces a stress concentration modeled by Inglis&#x27;s equation
:formula_5 (For sharp cracks)
where:
:formula_6 is the loading stress,
:formula_7 is half the length of the crack, and
:formula_8 is the radius of curvature at the crack tip.

Putting these two equations together gets
:formula_9

Sharp cracks (small formula_8) and large defects (large formula_7) both lower the fracture strength of the material.

Recently, scientists have discovered supersonic fracture, the phenomenon of crack propagation faster than the speed of sound in a material. This phenomenon was recently also verified by experiment of fracture in rubber-like materials.

The basic sequence in a typical brittle fracture is: introduction of a flaw either before or after the material is put in service, slow and stable crack propagation under recurring loading, and sudden rapid failure when the crack reaches critical crack length based on the conditions defined by fracture mechanics. Brittle fracture may be avoided by controlling three primary factors: material fracture toughness (K), nominal stress level (σ), and introduced flaw size (a). Residual stresses, temperature, loading rate, and stress concentrations also contribute to brittle fracture by influencing the three primary factors.

Under certain conditions, ductile materials can exhibit brittle behavior. Rapid loading, low temperature, and triaxial stress constraint conditions may cause ductile materials to fail without prior deformation.

===Ductile===
In ductile fracture, extensive plastic deformation (necking) takes place before fracture. The terms &quot;rupture&quot; and &quot;ductile rupture&quot; describe the ultimate failure of ductile materials loaded in tension. The extensive plasticity causes the crack to propagate slowly due to the absorption of a large amount of energy before fracture.
Because ductile rupture involves a high degree of plastic deformation, the fracture behavior of a propagating crack as modelled above changes fundamentally. Some of the energy from stress concentrations at the crack tips is dissipated by plastic deformation ahead of the crack as it propagates.

The basic steps in ductile fracture are microvoid formation, microvoid coalescence (also known as crack formation), crack propagation, and failure, often resulting in a cup-and-cone shaped failure surface. The microvoids nucleate at various internal discontinuities, such as precipitates, secondary phases, inclusions, and grain boundaries in the material. As local stress increases the microvoids grow, coalesce and eventually form a continuous fracture surface. Ductile fracture is typically transgranular and deformation due to dislocation slip can cause the shear lip characteristic of cup and cone fracture.

The microvoid coalescence results in a dimpled appearance on the fracture surface. The dimple shape is heavily influenced by the type of loading. Fracture under local uniaxial tensile loading usually results in formation of equiaxed dimples. Failures caused by shear will produce elongated or parabolic shaped dimples that point in opposite directions on the matching fracture surfaces. Finally, tensile tearing produces elongated dimples that point in the same direction on matching fracture surfaces.

==Characteristics==
The manner in which a crack propagates through a material gives insight into the mode of fracture. With ductile fracture a crack moves slowly and is accompanied by a large amount of plastic deformation around the crack tip. A ductile crack will usually not propagate unless an increased stress is applied and generally cease propagating when loading is removed. In a ductile material, a crack may progress to a section of the material where stresses are slightly lower and stop due to the blunting effect of plastic deformations at the crack tip. On the other hand, with brittle fracture, cracks spread very rapidly with little or no plastic deformation. The cracks that propagate in a brittle material will continue to grow once initiated.

Crack propagation is also categorized by the crack characteristics at the microscopic level. A crack that passes through the grains within the material is undergoing transgranular fracture. A crack that propagates along the grain boundaries is termed an intergranular fracture. Typically, the bonds between material grains are stronger at room temperature than the material itself, so transgranular fracture is more likely to occur. When temperatures increase enough to weaken the grain bonds, intergranular fracture is the more common fracture mode.

==Testing==
Fracture in materials is studied and quantified in multiple ways. Fracture is largely determined by the fracture toughness (formula_12), so fracture testing is often done to determine this. The two most widely used techniques for determining fracture toughness are the three-point flexural test and the compact tension test.

By performing the compact tension and three-point flexural tests, one is able to determine the fracture toughness through the following equation:

:formula_13

Where:
:formula_14 is an empirically-derived equation to capture the test sample geometry
:formula_15 is the fracture stress, and
:formula_16 is the crack length.

To accurately attain formula_12, the value of formula_18 must be precisely measured. This is done by taking the test piece with its fabricated notch of length formula_19 and sharpening this notch to better emulate a crack tip found in real-world materials. Cyclical prestressing the sample can then induce a fatigue crack which extends the crack from the fabricated notch length of formula_19 to formula_18. This value formula_18 is used in the above equations for determining formula_12.

Following this test, the sample can then be reoriented such that further loading of a load (F) will extend this crack and thus a load versus sample deflection curve can be obtained. With this curve, the slope of the linear portion, which is the inverse of the compliance of the material, can be obtained. This is then used to derive f(c/a) as defined above in the equation. With the knowledge of all these variables, formula_12 can then be calculated.

==Ceramics and inorganic glasses==
Ceramics and inorganic glasses have fracturing behavior that differ those of metallic materials. Ceramics have high strengths and perform well in high temperatures due to the material strength being independent of temperature. Ceramics have low toughness as determined by testing under a tensile load; often, ceramics have formula_12 values that are ~5% of that found in metals. However, as demonstrated by Faber and Evans, fracture toughness can be predicted and improved with crack deflection around second phase particles. Ceramics are usually loaded in compression in everyday use, so the compressive strength is often referred to as the strength; this strength can often exceed that of most metals. However, ceramics are brittle and thus most work done revolves around preventing brittle fracture. Due to how ceramics are manufactured and processed, there are often preexisting defects in the material introduce a high degree of variability in the Mode I brittle fracture. Thus, there is a probabilistic nature to be accounted for in the design of ceramics. The Weibull distribution predicts the survival probability of a fraction of samples with a certain volume that survive a tensile stress sigma, and is often used to better assess the success of a ceramic in avoiding fracture.

==Fiber bundles==
To model fracture of a bundle of fibers, the Fiber Bundle Model was introduced by Thomas Pierce in 1926 as a model to understand the strength of composite materials. The bundle consists of a large number of parallel Hookean springs of identical length and each having identical spring constants. They have however different breaking stresses. All these springs are suspended from a rigid horizontal platform. The load is attached to a horizontal platform, connected to the lower ends of the springs. When this lower platform is absolutely rigid, the load at any point of time is shared equally (irrespective of how many fibers or springs have broken and where) by all the surviving fibers. This mode of load-sharing is called Equal-Load-Sharing mode. The lower platform can also be assumed to have finite rigidity, so that local deformation of the platform occurs wherever springs fail and the surviving neighbor fibers have to share a larger fraction of that transferred from the failed fiber. The extreme case is that of local load-sharing model, where load of the failed spring or fiber is shared (usually equally) by the surviving nearest neighbor fibers.

==Disasters==
Failures caused by brittle fracture have not been limited to any particular category of engineered structure. Though brittle fracture is less common than other types of failure, the impacts to life and property can be more severe. The following notable historic failures were attributed to brittle fracture:
* Pressure vessels: Great Molasses Flood in 1919, New Jersey molasses tank failure in 1973
* Bridges: King Street Bridge span collapse in 1962, Silver Bridge collapse in 1967, partial failure of the Hoan Bridge in 2000
* Ships: Titanic in 1912, Liberty ships during World War II, SS Schenectady in 1943

==Computational fracture mechanics==
Virtually every area of engineering has been significantly impacted by computers, and fracture mechanics is no exception. Since there are so few actual problems with closed-form analytical solutions, numerical modelling has become an essential tool in fracture analysis. There are literally hundreds of configurations for which stress-intensity solutions have been published, the majority of which were derived from numerical models. The J integral and crack-tip-opening displacement (CTOD) calculations are two more increasingly popular elastic-plastic studies. Additionally, experts are using cutting-edge computational tools to study unique issues such ductile crack propagation, dynamic fracture, and fracture at interfaces. The exponential rise in computational fracture mechanics applications is essentially the result of quick developments in computer technology.

Most used computational numerical methods are finite element and boundary integral equation methods. Other methods include stress and displacement matching, element crack advance in which latter two come under Traditional Methods in Computational Fracture Mechanics.

===The finite element method===
The structures are divided into discrete elements of 1-D beam, 2-D plane stress or plane strain, 3-D bricks or tetrahedron types. The continuity of the elements are enforced using the nodes.

===The boundary integral equation method===
In this method, the surface is divided into two regions: a region where displacements are specified Su and region with tractions are specified ST . With given boundary conditions, the stresses, strains, and displacements within the body can all theoretically be solved for, along with the tractions on Su and the displacements on ST. It is a very powerful technique to find the unknown tractions and displacements.

===Traditional methods in computational fracture mechanics===
These methods are used to determine the fracture mechanics parameters using numerical analysis. Some of the traditional methods in computational fracture mechanics, which were commonly used in the past, have been replaced by newer and more advanced techniques. The newer techniques are considered to be more accurate and efficient, meaning they can provide more precise results and do so more quickly than the older methods. Not all traditional methods have been completely replaced, as they can still be useful in certain scenarios, but they may not be the most optimal choice for all applications.

Some of the traditional methods in computational fracture mechanics are:
* Stress and displacement matching
* Elemental crack advance
* Contour integration
* Virtual crack extension

<text>Mouse chording is the capability of performing actions when multiple mouse buttons are held down, much like a chorded keyboard and similar to mouse gestures.

One common application of mouse chording, called &quot;rocker navigation&quot;, is found in Opera and in mouse gesture extensions for Mozilla Firefox. Rocker navigation typically involves the following two mouse chords:
* Hold the left button and click the right button to move forward in the browser&#x27;s history.
* Hold the right button and click the left button to move backward in the browser&#x27;s history.

The operating systems Plan 9 and Oberon and the acme development environment make heavy use of mouse chording. OS/2 Presentation Manager can also use chording to copy and paste text using two buttons however Common User Access key combinations are more frequently used.

==Limitations==
Like mouse gestures, chorded actions may lack feedback and affordance and would therefore offer no way for users to discover possible chords without reference. A similar feature such as a context menu would require less training.

When Project Athena used equipment from both IBM and DEC, DEC mice had three buttons and IBM mice had two. Athena simulated the third (middle) button on IBM mice by chording the two buttons together. This does not enable chords which involve the middle click. The Apple Mighty Mouse does not support mouse chording due to the design of the button sensors.

==Applications that support mouse chording==

* 3DS Max - Any action in the main UI that involves clicking and dragging can be cancelled by right clicking while left button is still held down.
* Microstation - CAD software, uses chording to snap to elements.
* CATIA - CAD/CAM/CAE software, uses middle and left mouse button chording to zoom, pan and rotate screen representation
* Acme and Wily text editors
* Opera (web browser)
* Vivaldi (web browser)
* Maxthon
* Blender 3D
* Plan 9 from Bell Labs
* Oberon operating system
* Sketchup
* Valve Hammer Editor
* Celestia - Pressing both mouse buttons allows the user to adjust distance from an object.
* Minesweeper (Windows) - Pressing both mouse buttons clears around a square after the correct number of flags have been placed in the surrounding squares.
* UDE
* &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;
* &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; - The weapon aiming system in the PC version of &quot;San Andreas&quot; implements mouse chording, as it requires the user to hold the right mouse button to aim while clicking or holding the left button to fire a weapon or use an item, such as a camera.
* &quot;Eve Online&quot; - Pressing both the left and right mouse buttons allows for an alternative method of camera control.
* &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six: Vegas 2&quot; - On the PC version of the game, by default the right mouse button must be held to take cover and the left mouse button to fire a weapon.
* &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; - On the PC version, holding both buttons activates dual casting, shield bashing, or a powerful flurry of attacks when dual-wielding melee weapons.
* Any number of other first-person shooters where the iron sights view or aiming down sights is mapped to the right mouse button.
* &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order&quot; - On the PC version, once the player learns the lightsaber throw ability, they can use it by holding down the right mouse button to block, then clicking the left mouse button (used for a lightsaber attack by itself) to throw the lightsaber. Later in the game, they can perform a split saber attack by clicking with both mouse buttons simultaneously.
* Symbolics Genera (operating system) - the user interface management system Dynamic Windows is fully object oriented. It remembers objects for all output. Output is mouse sensitive depending on context. A three-button mouse is supported and mouse buttons can be modified additionally with shift keys (shift, control, meta, shift-control, ...). A mouse documentation line at the bottom of the screen shows the available mouse commands for the object under the mouse cursor and is continuously updated.

<doc id="261972" wikidata="Q7598595" url="?curid=261972" title="Standing committee (United States Congress)">
<text>In the United States Congress, standing committees are permanent legislative panels established by the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate rules. (House Rule X, Senate Rule XXV.) Because they have legislative jurisdiction, standing committees consider bills and issues and recommend measures for consideration by their respective chambers. They also have oversight responsibility to monitor agencies, programs, and activities within their jurisdictions, and in some cases in areas that cut across committee jurisdictions. Due to their permanent nature, these committees exist beyond the adjournment of each two-year meeting of Congress.

Most standing committees recommend funding levels—authorizations—for government operations and for new and existing programs. A few have other functions.
For example, the Appropriations Committees recommend legislation to provide budget authority for federal agencies and programs. The Budget Committees establish aggregate
levels for total spending and revenue that serve as guidelines for the work of the authorizing and appropriating panels. Committees also provide oversight of federal agencies and programs.

The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 greatly reduced the number of committees. The membership of each committee is adopted at the beginning of each Congress, usually by adoption of a formal resolution. Each committee is assigned its own staff to assist with its legislative, investigative, and research functions. Several committees divide their work into sub units called subcommittees.

Committee sizes range from 6 to 50 members per committee. In the House, one person may not serve on more than two standing committees and four subcommittees at one time, though waivers can be granted to serve on additional committees. Also in the House, the House Republican Steering Committee assigns Republican representatives to their committee(s), while the Steering and Policy Committee is in charge of assigning Democratic representatives to committees. The Senate follows similar procedures, with senators being limited to no more than three full committees and five sub-committees.

==Current number of standing committees==
 16 standing committees and the House had 20 standing committees. (The count is for &quot;standing&quot; committees only and does not include select or special committees or joint committees. See those articles for that information.)

<text>Angel Falls (; Pemon: &quot;Kerepakupai Merú&quot; or &quot;Parakupá Vená&quot;) is a waterfall in Venezuela.
It is the world&#x27;s tallest uninterrupted waterfall, with a height of , and a plunge of . The waterfall drops over the edge of the Auyán-tepui mountain in the Canaima National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Canaima), a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Gran Sabana region of Bolívar State. The height figure, , mostly consists of the main plunge but also includes about of sloped cascade and rapids below the drop and a plunge downstream of the talus rapids.

The falls are along a fork of the Río Kerepacupai Merú which flows into the Churún River, a tributary of the Carrao River, itself a tributary of the Orinoco River.

With regard to overall height, a revisited validation of waterfall measurements is not available, and there is still uncertainty whether Angel Falls or South Africa&#x27;s Tugela Falls is the tallest (both measurements were taken at considerable distance from the two waterfalls).

==History==
===Etymology===
The waterfall has been known as Angel Falls since the mid-20th century; they are named after Jimmie Angel, a U.S. aviator, who was the first person to fly over the falls. Angel&#x27;s ashes were scattered over the falls on 2 July 1960.

The common Spanish name &quot;Salto Ángel&quot; derives from his surname. In 2009, President Hugo Chávez announced his intention to change the name to the purported original indigenous Pemon term (&quot;Kerepakupai-Merú&quot;, meaning &quot;waterfall of the deepest place&quot;), on the grounds that the nation&#x27;s most famous landmark should bear an indigenous name. Explaining the name change, Chávez reportedly said, &quot;This is ours, long before Angel ever arrived there... this is indigenous land.&quot; However he later said that he would not decree the change of name, but was only defending the use of Kerepakupai Vená.

===Exploration===
During his expedition to find the fabled city of El Dorado, Walter Raleigh described what was possibly a &quot;tepui&quot; (table top mountain), and he is said to have been the first European to view Angel Falls, although these claims are considered far-fetched. Some historians say that the first European to visit the waterfall was Fernando de Berrío, a Spanish explorer and governor from the 16th and 17th centuries. Other sources claim that the first Westerner to see the waterfall was the Spanish explorer Fèlix Cardona in 1927. 

They were not known to the outside world until American aviator Jimmie Angel, following directions given by Cardona, flew over them on 16 November 1933 on a flight while he was searching for a valuable ore bed.

Returning on 9 October 1937, Angel tried to land his Flamingo monoplane &quot;El Río Caroní&quot; atop Auyán-tepui, but the plane was damaged when the wheels sank into the marshy ground. Angel and his three companions, including his wife Marie, were forced to descend the tepui on foot. It took them 11 days to make their way back to civilization by the gradually sloping back side, but news of their adventure spread and the waterfall was named Angel Falls in his honor. The name of the waterfall—&quot;Salto del Ángel&quot;—was first published on a Venezuelan government map in December 1939.

Angel&#x27;s plane remained on top of the tepui for 33 years before being lifted out by helicopter. It was restored at the Aviation Museum in Maracay, Venezuela and now sits outdoors on the front of the airport at Ciudad Bolívar in Venezuela.

The first recorded European to reach the base of the falls was the Latvian explorer Aleksandrs Laime, also known as Alejandro Laime to the native Pemon tribe. He reached the falls alone in 1946. He was the first to reach the upper side of the falls in the late 1950s, by climbing up the back side, where the slope is not vertical. He also reached Angel&#x27;s plane 18 years after the crash landing. On 18 November 1955, Latvian independence day, he announced to the Venezuelan newspaper &quot;El Nacional&quot; that this stream without any known local name should be named after a Latvian river, Gauja. In the same year, this name was registered in the National Cartographic Institution of Venezuela. There is no convincing proof that the indigenous Pemon people had named the local streams, as Auyán-tepui was considered to be a dangerous place and was not visited by the indigenous people. However, lately the Pemon name Kerep is used as well. Laime was also the first to clear a trail that leads from the Churún River to the base of the falls. On the way is a viewpoint commonly used to capture the falls in photographs. It is named Mirador Laime (&quot;Laime&#x27;s Viewpoint&quot; in Spanish) in his honor. This trail is used now mostly for tourists, to lead them from the Isla Ratón camp to the small clearing.

The official height of the falls was determined by a survey carried out by an expedition organized and financed by American journalist Ruth Robertson on 13 May 1949. Robertson&#x27;s expedition, which began on 23 April 1949, was also the first to reach the foot of the falls. The first known attempt to climb the face of the cliff was made in 1968 during the wet season. It failed because of slippery rock. In 1969, a second attempt was made during the dry season. This attempt was thwarted by lack of water and an overhang from the top. The first climb to the top of the cliff was completed on 13 January 1971. The climbers, a four-man team led by American mountaineer George Bogel, an electrical engineer from Pittsburgh, required nine and a half days to ascend and one and a half days to rappel down.

==Tourism==
Angel Falls is one of Venezuela&#x27;s top tourist attractions, though a trip to the falls is a complicated affair. The falls are located in an isolated jungle. A flight from Maiquetia Airport, Puerto Ordaz, or Ciudad Bolívar is required to reach Canaima camp, the starting point for river trips to the base of the falls. River trips generally take place from June to December, when the rivers are deep enough for use by the Pemon guides. During the dry season (December to March), the volume of water is less than in other months.

== Media ==
=== Cinema ===
Angel Falls was the main inspiration for the fictional Paradise Falls in Pixar&#x27;s animated film, &quot;Up&quot;.

The American fantasy-romance film &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998), starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Annabella Sciorra, is set in Venezuela and shows Angel Falls.

Angel Falls was used as a setting for a scene in the action film &quot;Point Break&quot; (2015); actors Edgar Ramirez and Luke Bracey free-climb the Falls.

In the film narrated by Lowell Thomas, &quot;Seven Wonders of the World&quot; (1956), Angel Falls was included as one of the seven wonders.

The 1990 film &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; was partly set at Angel Falls.

===Books===
In 1997, Folco Quilici wrote &quot;Cielo verde&quot; a novel – long present in the bestseller list in Italy. Spanish writer Alberto Vázquez-Figueroa covered Jimmie Angel&#x27;s adventures in his 1998 novel &quot;Ícaro&quot;— , later translated into several foreign languages. There is also another book that details how Angel Falls got its name: &quot;Truth or Dare: The Jimmie Angel Story&quot; written by Jan-Willem de Vries 
&quot;Angel Falls&quot; by Kathryn Casey was published in September 2023; it is a historical fiction story inspired by the life of the photographer Ruth Robertson.

<text>Negros Oriental (; ), officially the Province of Negros Oriental (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Negros Island Region. Its capital is the city of Dumaguete, one of the two regional centers of Negros Island Region, with the other being Bacolod. It occupies the southeastern half of the large island of Negros, and borders Negros Occidental, which comprises the northwestern half. It also includes Apo Island, a popular dive site for both local and foreign tourists.

Negros Oriental faces Cebu to the east across the Tañon Strait and Siquijor to the southeast. The primary spoken language is Cebuano, and the predominant religious denomination is Roman Catholicism. Dumaguete is the capital, seat of government, and most populous city of the province. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 1,432,990 people, making it the second most-populous province in the region after Negros Occidental, the fifth most-populous province in the Visayas, and the 19th most-populous province of the Philippines.

==History==
===Early history===
Negros, the largest island in the Visayas, is believed to have once been part of a larger landmass that was cut off by rising waters at the end of the last ice age. Among the early inhabitants of the island were the Negritos and the Austronesians, and later the Han Chinese, who are mainly merchants. They called the island &quot;Buglas&quot;, a native word which is believed to mean &quot;cut off&quot;.

===Spanish colonial era===
Spanish explorers on the expedition of Miguel Lopez de Legazpi first came to the island in April 1565. Legazpi dropped anchor in Bohol and sent his men to scout the island. Because of the strong currents of the Tañon Strait between Cebu and Negros, they were carried for several days and forced to land on the western side of the island. They reported seeing many dark-skinned inhabitants, and they called the island &quot;Negros&quot; (&quot;Negro&quot; means &quot;black&quot; in Spanish). The island was sparsely settled at the time, except for a few coastal settlements including Ilog and Binalbagan. In 1571, Legaspi assigned encomiendas on the island to 13 of his men. Augustinian friars began the Christianization of the island the next year. The island was administered as part of the jurisdiction of Oton until 1734 when it became a military district, and Ilog became the capital of the island. The capital was transferred to Himamaylan in 1795. Negros became a politico-military province in 1865 and the capital was transferred to Bacolod.

Due to its proximity to Mindanao, the southeastern coasts of Negros were in constant threat from Moro marauders looking for slaves, so watchtowers were built to protect the Christian villages. The Moro raids and Negros Oriental&#x27;s distance from the Negrense capital of Bacolod, induced 13 Recollectionist priests to petition for the division of the island in July 1876. The island of Negros was then divided into the provinces of Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental by a royal decree executed by Governor General Valeriano Weyler on January 1, 1890. Dumaguete was made the first and only capital of Negros Oriental. In 1892, Siquijor became a part of Negros Oriental, having previously been administered by Spain under the politico-military province of Bohol.

The Philippine Revolution reached Negros in 1898, disrupting government functions but without extreme violence and bloodshed. Revolutionary troops in the island were composed mostly of farm labourers and other prominent people of the province of Negros Oriental, who were organized and led by Don Diego de la Viña. The Spanish colonial government in Dumaguete and the rest of the island was overthrown on November 24, 1898. Later, the Negros Occidental area under the leadership of Gen. Araneta, along with the Negros Oriental area under the leadership of Don Diego de la Viña, merged to form the Cantonal Republic of Negros, a separate government from the more familiar Malolos Republic established in Luzon.

===American occupation era===
In 1901, the Negros Oriental province was reorganized by the United States and a civil government was established, with Demetrio Larena as governor. The American government made Siquijor a &quot;sub-province&quot; of Negros Oriental. Negros Oriental became a province under the American civil government on March 10, 1917, through &quot;Act 2711&quot;. In 1934, Negros Oriental became a &quot;corregimiento&quot;, a separate military district. Under the American colonial government, transportation infrastructure was developed with improvements of roads and new bridges.

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, both Negros provinces were invaded by Imperial Japanese forces, resorting many residents to flee to the inland mountains. Negros Island was liberated by combined Philippine &amp; American troops with the local Negrense guerillas attacking the Japanese on August 6, 1945. The 7th, 73rd, 74th, and 75th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were established from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, at the Military General Headquarters in Negros Oriental. They started the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial Military Operations in Negros from 1942 to 1945 against the Japanese Imperial forces.

===Contemporary===
On September 17, 1971, Siquijor became an independent province by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 6396&quot;.

The municipality of Guihulngan became a component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 9409&quot; which sought to convert the municipality into a city. The law was ratified on June 14, 2007. However, the cityhood status was lost twice in the years 2008 and 2010 after the LCP questioned the validity of the cityhood law. The cityhood status was reaffirmed after the court finalized its ruling on February 15, 2011 which declared the cityhood law constitutional.
On May 29, 2015, the Negros Island Region was formed when President Benigno Aquino III signed &quot;Executive Order No. 183, s. 2015&quot;. Negros Oriental was separated from the Central Visayas region and transferred to the new region along with Negros Occidental and Bacolod. However, on August 9, 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte dissolved the Negros Island Region, revoking &quot;Executive Order No. 183, s. 2015&quot; through the signing of &quot;Executive Order No. 38&quot;, citing a lack of funds to fully establish the region according to Benjamin Diokno, the Secretary of Budget and Management. This returned Negros Oriental to the Central Visayas region. 

In 2018, with the Duterte administration promoting federalism, the idea of Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental reunified into one federal region was discussed with local provincial politicians, with some additional support from the known native Negrenses. There is also a suggestion, jointly approved by the provincial governors, that Negros Oriental along with Negros Occidental, be renamed with their pre-colonial names as &quot;&quot;Buglas Sidlakan&quot; and &quot;Buglas Nakatundan&quot; respectively, with Negros, as a federal state, be named as &quot;Negrosanon Federated Region&quot;, due to the negative racial connotation associated with the name &quot;Negros&quot;&quot;.

On June 13, 2024, Negros Oriental was transferred from Central Visayas to the Negros Island Region after President Bongbong Marcos signed &quot;Republic Act 12000&quot;.

====Centennial anniversary of the Negros Oriental Capitol building====
On May 17, 2024, the 1924 Grecian-Ionic Daniel Burnham &quot;Negros Oriental Capitol&quot; building&#x27;s historical marker for the centennial anniversary-&quot;Jubilee Year&quot; commemoration was installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines&#x27; Directress Carminda Arevalo. Governor Manuel &quot;Chaco&quot; L. Sagarbarria signed the marker&#x27;s Certificate of Transfer in the presence of Imee Marcos, Francis Tolentino, Mark Villar, Risa Hontiveros, Lito Lapid, Jinggoy Estrada, Irish Ambassador William John Carlos and Philippine Tour Operators Association who graced the historic event along Dumaguete North Road, Dumaguete City. Kuh Ledesma, Silliman University Dance Troupe and Orchestra Sin Arco performed with others followed by the finale, Pyro Musical Competition at the Freedom Park.

==Geography==

Negros Oriental occupies the southeastern half of the island of Negros, with Negros Occidental comprising the northwestern half. It has a total land area of . A chain of rugged mountains separates Negros Oriental from Negros Occidental. Negros Oriental faces Cebu to the east across the Tañon Strait and Siquijor to the southeast. The Sulu Sea borders it to the south to southwest. Negros is primarily volcanic, making its soil ideal for agriculture. Eighty percent of all arable land in the island region is cultivated.

===Topography===

The province&#x27;s topography is characterized by low, grooved mountain ranges, some of which lie close to the shoreline. At the southern end of the province is Mount Talinis, also known as &quot;Cuernos de Negros&quot; (&quot;Horns of Negros&quot;), which is a dormant complex volcano which rises to a height of . At the northern end of the province is the active Kanlaon Volcano, the highest peak of the island region with a height of . There are a few flatlands and plateaus in the interior to the southwest of the province, which includes the Tablas Plateau.

One of the landmarks of Dumaguete is the Dumaguete Bell Tower which stands next to the Saint Catherine of Alexandria Cathedral. It was once used to warn the city of impending pirate attacks.

===Climate===
Negros Oriental has a tropical climate. Because of the mountain range running from the north to the south, the province has two types of climatic conditions. The eastern part of the province is characterized as having a modestly distinct wet season, and a short dry season lasting from one to three months. The western half of the province is characterized by a distinct wet season and dry season.

==Administrative divisions==

Negros Oriental comprises 19 municipalities and 6 cities, further subdivided into 557 barangays.

Dumaguete is the provincial capital and seat of government. It is also the province&#x27;s most populous city, despite having the smallest land area among all component cities and municipalities of Negros Oriental.
For purposes of legislative representation, the cities and municipalities are grouped into three congressional districts, with each district electing a congressman to the House of Representatives of the Philippines.


==Demographics==


The population of Negros Oriental in the 2020 census was 1,432,990 people, with a density of . In 2010, its registered voting population was 606,634. 34.5% of the population are concentrated in the six most populous component cities of Dumaguete, Bayawan, Guihulngan, Tanjay, Bais and Canlaon. Population growth per year is about 0.99% between 2010 and 2015, lower than the national average of 1.72%.

Residents of the whole Negros island are generally called &quot;Negrenses&quot; (and less often &quot;Negrosanons&quot;) while residents of Negros Oriental sometimes refer to themselves specifcally as &quot;NegOrenses&quot; to distinguish themselves from residents of Negros Occidental. Many NegOrenses are of either pure/mixed Austronesian heritage, with foreign ancestry (i.e. Chinese and/or Spanish) as minorities. 

===Languages===
Negros Oriental is predominantly a Cebuano-speaking province due to its close proximity to Cebu, with 72% of residents reporting it as a first language. Hiligaynon is spoken by the remaining 28% and is common in areas close to the border with Negros Occidental. Filipino and English, while seldom used as first languages, are generally understood and used for official, literary, and educational purposes.

===Religion===
Christianity is the predominant religion in the province with Roman Catholicism (75%) as the largest single denomination . However, there is a strong and growing presence of mainline and evangelical Protestant which forms about 9% of the province population. The Iglesia ni Cristo forms 3-5% of the total population , the Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the Aglipayan Church, also known as the Philippine Independent Church, also have some presence. Adherents of Islam and Buddhism constitute a minority of the population.

==Economy==
With its vast fertile land resources, Negros Oriental&#x27;s other major industry is agriculture. The primary crops are sugarcane, sweetcorn, coconut and rice. In the coastal areas, fishing is the main source of income. People are also involved in cattle ranches, fish ponds and rubber plantations, especially in Bayawan. There are also mineral deposits like gold, silver, and copper found throughout the inner areas of the province.
The province is already emerging as a major technological center in Visayas, with its growing business process outsourcing (BPO) that has started to penetrate the province&#x27;s secondary cities and other technology-related industries. Vehicle assembly is a growing industry in Amlan. Construction of mass housing and subdivisions is very evident in the periphery of Dumaguete and is expected to spill over into the province&#x27;s secondary cities and fast-growing towns.

Other industries include water bottling and warehousing, as well as cold and dry storing. Retailing has penetrated other urban areas outside Dumaguete, with the entry of supermarkets and shopping malls in cities such as Bayawan, Tanjay, and Bais. The town of Bacong, which borders Dumaguete in the south, hosts many industrial plants geared for the local and export markets, which can bolster economic growth. Negros Oriental is also a notable tourist destination in the Visayas.

==Transportation==

Negros Oriental has a network of roads, including a national road that spans the circumference of Negros Island. National and provincial roads in the province total more than 900 kilometers, though only about half of these are paved.

Many residents do not own private vehicles and rely solely on public transport. Buses and jeepneys link the cities and municipalities of the province. For short distances within a town, motorized tricycles (&quot;tricycles&quot; for short) are available. Moreover, motorcycle taxis, known locally as &quot;habal-habal&quot;, are the primary mode of transportation in places that cannot be reached with other types of vehicles.
Sibulan Airport, located in Sibulan, is the province&#x27;s only commercial airport. It is a domestic airport with multiple daily flights to and from Manila, served by Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific. The airport also serves flights to and from Cebu and Cagayan de Oro. Based on 2002 statistics, an average of 5,800 outgoing passengers and 5,700 incoming passengers pass through the airport every month. In March 2021, upgrade works were made to the current Sibulan Airport which included pavement reconstruction, expansion of the terminal building, and expansion of CAAP administrative buildings. The airport is due for transfer to Bacong because of congestion in its current location and has been proposed since 2014 and is still pending final approval as of 2022.

The primary seaport of the province is the Port of Dumaguete. Additionally, there are five other seaports in the province classified as tertiary.

<text>Ramnefjellsfossen (also known as: Utigardsfossen or Utigordsfossen) is unofficially listed as the third-highest waterfall in the world in several publications. On the other hand, The World Waterfall Database, a waterfall enthusiast website, which includes all minor and seasonal waterfalls in the country, lists it as eleventh-tallest. The falls are located on the mountain, Ramnefjellet, in the municipality of Stryn in Vestland county, Norway–about southeast of the villages of Loen and Olden.

The tiered horsetail waterfall has four drops measuring , with the longest single drop measuring . The average width of the falls are over the long run from top to bottom. The average flow of the falls are , with the best flow in the summer.

The falls are fed by the Ramnefjellbreen glacier, an arm of the great Jostedalsbreen glacier. After the falls, the water flows into the lake Lovatnet. The falls are easily reached by boat, sea plane, or road, and a campsite is located within hiking distance of the base of the falls. The total drop is from three free-leaping cascades. Due to the small flow of water it is one of the few major waterfalls in Norway that has not been slated for hydroelectric usage.

The mountain, Ramnefjellet, has killed over 100 people as a result of major landslides in 1905 and 1936. A 2008 photograph of the falls taken from Lovatnet lake was included in the Emirates &quot;Skywards&quot; brochure.

<text>USS &quot;Confederacy was a 36-gun [[sailing frigate]] of the [[Continental Navy]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The British [[Royal Navy]] captured her in March 1781. The British named her Confederate&quot; but never commissioned her. She reached England in about half-a-year and was broken up in 1782.

==Career==

She was launched on 8 November 1778 at Chatham (Norwich), Connecticut, and towed to New London to be prepared for sea. From 1 May to 24 August 1779 she cruised on the Atlantic coast under the command of Captain Seth Harding. While convoying a fleet of merchantmen, on 6 June, she and captured three prizes, drove off two British frigates and brought the convoy safely into Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

On 17 September 1779 &quot;Confederacy&quot; was ordered to carry the French Minister and his family back to France. Later John Jay, the first American Minister to Spain, his secretary, and family were added to the passenger list. During the passage on 7 November 1779 &quot;Confederacy&quot; was completely dismasted and almost lost, but managed through the skillful seamanship of Captain Harding to reach Martinique early in December. After repairs, she returned to convoy duty.

Captain Nicholson replaced Harding in on 20 October 1780.

&quot;Confederacy&quot; was homeward bound from Cape Francois in the West Indies in 1781 with military stores and other supplies and escorting a fleet of 37 merchantmen, when on 14 April she encountered (44) and (32) off the Delaware Capes. The British ships forced &quot;Confederacy&quot; to strike her flag. Most of the merchantmen she was escorting escaped. Many of her crew were sent to the old prison hulk , though some ended up in Mill and Forton prisons.

==Fate==

The Royal Navy sent her to England, under the command of Captain James Cumming. He paid her off in September 1781. She was never commissioned and was docked on 18 November 1781 at Woolwich. She was broken up there in March 1782.

<doc id="261985" wikidata="Q3132765" url="?curid=261985" title="Henry E. Huntington">
<text>Henry Edwards Huntington (February 27, 1850 – May 23, 1927) was an American railroad magnate and collector of art and rare books. Huntington settled in Los Angeles, where he owned the Pacific Electric Railway as well as substantial real estate interests. In addition to being a businessman and art collector, Huntington was a major booster for Los Angeles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many places in California are named after him.

==History in Southern California==
Born in 1850 in Oneonta, New York, to Solon Huntington (1812–1890) and his wife, Henry Saunders (1821–1906) grew up hearing about his uncle Collis P. Huntington. His uncle became one of The Big Four, instrumental in creating the Central Pacific Railroad (later part of the Southern Pacific), one of the two railroads that built the transcontinental railway in 1869. 

Henry Huntington later worked with his uncle, holding several executive positions under him with the Southern Pacific. After Collis Huntington&#x27;s death in 1900, Henry Huntington assumed the senior Huntington&#x27;s leadership role with Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Virginia. He later married his uncle&#x27;s widow Arabella Huntington. 

In 1906, Huntington divorced his first wife Mary Alice Prentice Huntington (1852–1916). They had four children together: Howard Edward (1876–1922), Clara Leonora (1878–1965), Elizabeth Vincent (1880–1965), and Marian Prentice (1883–1973). His wife Mary died in 1916. She was the birth sister of Clara Elizabeth Prentice-Huntington, whom his Uncle Collis and his first wife Elizabeth had adopted. 

Huntington&#x27;s marriage to the widowed Arabella Huntington in 1913 shocked San Francisco society. They were about the same age, so had no children. 

Huntington expected to assume control of the Central and Southern Pacific after his uncle&#x27;s death. He was blocked by bondholder&#x27;s representative James Speyer, forcing him to sell his interests to E. H. Harriman.

In 1898, in friendly competition with his uncle&#x27;s Southern Pacific, Huntington bought the narrow gauge city-oriented Los Angeles Railway (LARy), known as the &#x27;Yellow Car&#x27; system. In 1901, Huntington formed the sprawling interurban, standard gauge Pacific Electric Railway (the PE), known as the &#x27;Red Car&#x27; system, centered at 6th and Main streets in Los Angeles. Huntington succeeded in this competition by providing passenger-friendly streetcars on 24/7 schedules, which the railroads could not match. This was in the period of a boom in Southern California land development. Housing was built in places such as Orange County&#x27;s Huntington Beach, a Huntington-sponsored development, and streetcars served passenger needs that the railroads had not considered. Connectivity to Downtown Los Angeles made such suburbs feasible.

By 1910, the Huntington trolley systems spanned approximately of Southern California. At its greatest extent, the system contained over 20 streetcar lines and 1,250 trolleys, most running through the core of Los Angeles and serving such nearby neighborhoods as the Crenshaw district, West Adams, Echo Park, Westlake, Hancock Park, Exposition Park, Vernon, Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights. The system integrated the 1902 acquisition, the Mount Lowe Scenic Railway above Altadena, California in the San Gabriel Mountains.

In 1905, Huntington, A. Kingsley Macomber, and William R. Staats developed the Oak Knoll subdivision, located to the west of his San Marino estate in the oak-covered hilly terrain near Pasadena.

In 1906, Huntington, along with Frank Miller, owner of the Mission Inn, and Charles M. Loring, formed the &quot;Huntington Park Association&quot;, with the intent to purchase Mount Rubidoux in Riverside, build a road to the summit, and develop the hill as a park to benefit the city of Riverside. park. The road was completed in February 1907. The property was later donated to the city of Riverside by the heirs of Frank Miller, and today the hill is a city park.

Huntington was a Life Member of the Sons of the Revolution in the State of California.

Huntington retired from business in 1916. On May 23, 1927, Henry E. Huntington died in Philadelphia while undergoing surgery. He and Arabella are buried, with a large monument, in the Gardens of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.

==Hotel==

The Huntington Hotel was originally named Hotel Wentworth when it opened on February 1, 1907. Financial problems and a disappointing first season forced it to close indefinitely. Henry Huntington purchased the Wentworth in 1911, renaming it the Huntington Hotel. It reopened in 1914, transformed into a winter resort. The 1920s were prosperous for the hotel, as Midwestern and Eastern entrepreneurs discovered California&#x27;s warm winter climate.

The hotel&#x27;s reputation for fine service began with long-time general manager and later owner Stephen W. Royce. By 1926, the hotel&#x27;s success prompted Royce to open the property year-round. The &quot;golden years&quot; ended with the stock market crash and the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s. By the end of the 1930s the hotel was vibrant again. When World War II began, all reservations were cancelled and the hotel was rented to the Army for $3,000 a month. Following the war, the Huntington&#x27;s fortunes improved again. In 1954 Stephen Royce sold the hotel to the Sheraton Corporation, serving as general manager until his retirement in 1969. The hotel operated until 1985, when it closed because of its inability to meet seismic standards. The structure was built of reinforced concrete in 1906.

After a -year major renovation, the hotel reopened in March 1991 as the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel and Spa. The hotel completed a $19 million renovation in January 2006; it changed hands in early 2007 and became Langham Brand International, Huntington Hotel &amp; SPA.

==Legacy==

Huntington left a prominent legacy with the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens on his former estate in San Marino near Pasadena. Other legacies in California include the cities of Huntington Beach and Huntington Park, as well as Huntington Lake. Huntington is credited with creating the first Homeowner&#x27;s Association as a means of de facto segregation in his investment properties.

Also in greater Los Angeles are the Huntington Hospital in Pasadena, Henry E. Huntington Middle School in San Marino, and the grand boulevard, Huntington Drive, running eastbound from downtown Los Angeles. Its landscaped central parkway was previously the right-of-way for the Northern Division of the Pacific Electric.

Riverside&#x27;s city park on Mount Rubidoux was originally named Huntington Park, and the road to the top was named Huntington Drive. After Frank Miller&#x27;s heirs donated the property to the city, the city renamed the park the Frank A. Miller Rubidoux Memorial Park, and the road has become known as Mount Rubidoux Drive. A plaque that was dedicated to Huntington in 1907, in recognition of his contributions to the development of Mount Rubidoux, remains on a large boulder known as Huntington Rock. After Huntington&#x27;s death a second tablet was placed on the north side of the hill at a place named the Huntington Shrine.

His legacy on the East Coast includes the Huntington Memorial Library in Oneonta, New York, opened July 9, 1920 in his childhood home.

As well as a portrait by Oswald Birley at the Huntington Library, portraits of Huntington were also painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury who built a studio less than a mile from Huntington&#x27;s estate in San Marino in 1924-1925: a full-length, based on a photograph, is at the Collis Potter &amp; Howard Edwards Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, and two seated versions, a small one of which was acquired by Huntington&#x27;s son-in-law John Metcalf, and a larger one (which is presumed lost) which was engraved by an artist called Witherspoon in 1928. The artist also painted Huntington&#x27;s granddaughter Mary Brockway Metcalf (this is on long-term loan to the offices of the Director of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery).

<text>Mongefossen () is a waterfall in the Rauma Municipality of Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It is the fourth tallest single-drop waterfall in the world. It&#x27;s located near the European route E136 highway and the Rauma River, which it flows into. There is some dispute as to the height, but it is generally listed at . As is the case with many of Norway&#x27;s waterfalls, it has been targeted for hydroelectric power, which results in a greatly diminished water flow during the summer tourist season.

Mongefossen also holds the distinction as being the highest waterfall in the world which may be viewed from a railway station on the Rauma Line, on the north side between the villages of Flatmark and Marstein.

<doc id="261987" wikidata="Q18979" url="?curid=261987" title="Kanban">
<text>Kanban ( meaning signboard) is a scheduling system for lean manufacturing (also called just-in-time manufacturing, abbreviated JIT). Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban to improve manufacturing efficiency. The system takes its name from the cards that track production within a factory. Kanban is also known as the &quot;Toyota nameplate system&quot; in the automotive industry.

A goal of the kanban system is to limit the buildup of excess inventory at any point in production. Limits on the number of items waiting at supply points are established and then reduced as inefficiencies are identified and removed. Whenever a limit is exceeded, this points to an inefficiency that should be addressed.

In kanban, problem areas are highlighted by measuring lead time and cycle time of the full process and process steps. One of the main benefits of kanban is to establish an upper limit to work in process (commonly referred as &quot;WIP&quot;) inventory to avoid overcapacity. Other systems with similar effect exist, for example CONWIP. A systematic study of various configurations of kanban systems, such as &quot;generalized kanban&quot; or &quot;production authorization card&quot; (PAC) and &quot;extended kanban&quot;, of which CONWIP is an important special case, can be found in Tayur (1993), and more recently Liberopoulos and Dallery (2000), among other papers.

==Origins==
The system originates from the simplest visual stock replenishment signaling system, an empty box. This was first developed in the UK factories producing Spitfires during the Second World War, and was known as the &quot;two bin system&quot;. In the late 1940s, Toyota started studying supermarkets with the idea of applying shelf-stocking techniques to the factory floor. In a supermarket, customers generally retrieve what they need at the required time—no more, no less. Furthermore, the supermarket stocks only what it expects to sell in a given time, and customers take only what they need, because future supply is assured. This observation led Toyota to view a process as being a customer of one or more preceding processes and to view the preceding processes as a kind of store.

Kanban aligns inventory levels with actual consumption. A signal tells a supplier to produce and deliver a new shipment when a material is consumed. This signal is tracked through the replenishment cycle, bringing visibility to the supplier, consumer, and buyer.

Kanban uses the rate of demand to control the rate of production, passing demand from the end customer up through the chain of customer-store processes. In 1953, Toyota applied this logic in their main plant machine shop.

==Operation==
A key indicator of the success of production scheduling based on demand, &quot;pushing,&quot; is the ability of the demand-forecast to create such a &quot;push&quot;. Kanban, by contrast, is part of an approach where the &quot;pull&quot; comes from demand and products are made to order. Re-supply or production is determined according to customer orders.

In contexts where supply time is lengthy and demand is difficult to forecast, often the best one can do is to respond quickly to observed demand. This situation is exactly what a kanban system accomplishes, in that it is used as a demand signal that immediately travels through the supply chain. This ensures that intermediate stock held in the supply chain are better managed, and are usually smaller. Where the supply response is not quick enough to meet actual demand fluctuations, thereby causing potential lost sales, a stock building may be deemed more appropriate and is achieved by placing more kanban in the system.

Taiichi Ohno stated that to be effective, kanban must follow strict rules of use. Toyota, for example, has six simple rules, and close monitoring of these rules is a never-ending task, thereby ensuring that the kanban does what is required.

===Toyota&#x27;s six rules===
Toyota has formulated six rules for the application of kanban:
# Each process issues requests (kanban) to its suppliers when it consumes its supplies.
# Each process produces according to the quantity and sequence of incoming requests.
# No items are made or transported without a request.
# The request associated with an item is always attached to it.
# Processes must not send out defective items, to ensure that the finished products will be defect-free.
# Limiting the number of pending requests makes the process more sensitive and reveals inefficiencies.

===Kanban (cards)===

Kanban cards are a key component of kanban and they signal the need to move materials within a production facility or to move materials from an outside supplier into the production facility. The kanban card is, in effect, a message that signals a depletion of product, parts, or inventory. When received, the kanban triggers replenishment of that product, part, or inventory. Consumption, therefore, drives demand for more production, and the kanban card signals demand for more product—so kanban cards help create a demand-driven system.

It is widely held by proponents of lean production and manufacturing that demand-driven systems lead to faster turnarounds in production and lower inventory levels, helping companies implementing such systems be more competitive.

In the last few years, systems sending kanban signals electronically have become more widespread. While this trend is leading to a reduction in the use of kanban cards in aggregate, it is still common in modern lean production facilities to find the use of kanban cards. In various software systems, kanban is used for signalling demand to suppliers through email notifications. When stock of a particular component is depleted by the quantity assigned on kanban card, a &quot;kanban trigger&quot; is created (which may be manual or automatic), a purchase order is released with predefined quantity for the supplier defined on the card, and the supplier is expected to dispatch material within a specified lead-time.

Kanban cards, in keeping with the principles of kanban, simply convey the need for more materials. A red card lying in an empty parts cart conveys that more parts are needed.

===Three-bin system===
An example of a simple kanban system implementation is a &quot;three-bin system&quot; for the supplied parts, where there is no in-house manufacturing. One bin is on the factory floor (the initial demand point), one bin is in the factory store (the inventory control point), and one bin is at the supplier. The bins usually have a removable card containing the product details and other relevant information, the classic kanban card.

When the bin on the factory floor is empty (because the parts in it were used up in a manufacturing process), the empty bin and its kanban card are returned to the factory store (the inventory control point). The factory store replaces the empty bin on the factory floor with the full bin from the factory store, which also contains a kanban card. The factory store sends the empty bin with its kanban card to the supplier. The supplier&#x27;s full product bin, with its kanban card, is delivered to the factory store; the supplier keeps the empty bin. This is the final step in the process. Thus, the process never runs out of product—and could be described as a closed loop, in that it provides the exact amount required, with only one spare bin so there is never oversupply. This &#x27;spare&#x27; bin allows for uncertainties in supply, use, and transport in the inventory system. A good kanban system calculates just enough kanban cards for each product. Most factories that use kanban use the colored board system (heijunka box).

==Electronic kanban==

Many manufacturers have implemented electronic kanban (sometimes referred to as e-kanban) systems. These help to eliminate common problems such as manual entry errors and lost cards. E-kanban systems can be integrated into enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, enabling real-time demand signaling across the supply chain and improved visibility. Data pulled from e-kanban systems can be used to optimize inventory levels by better tracking supplier lead and replenishment times.

E-kanban is a signaling system that uses a mix of technology to trigger the movement of materials within a manufacturing or production facility. Electronic kanban differs from traditional kanban in using technology to replace traditional elements like kanban cards with barcodes and electronic messages like email or electronic data interchange.

A typical electronic kanban system marks inventory with barcodes, which workers scan at various stages of the manufacturing process to signal usage. The scans relay messages to internal/external stores to ensure the restocking of products. Electronic kanban often uses the Internet as a method of routing messages to external suppliers and as a means to allow a real-time view of inventory, via a portal, throughout the supply chain.

Organizations like the Ford Motor Company and Bombardier Aerospace have used electronic kanban systems to improve processes. Systems are now widespread from single solutions or bolt on modules to ERP systems.

==Types of kanban systems==
In a kanban system, adjacent upstream and downstream workstations communicate with each other through their cards, where each container has a kanban associated with it. Economic order quantity is important. The two most important types of kanbans are:
* Production (P) Kanban: A P-kanban, when received, authorizes the workstation to produce a fixed amount of products. The P-kanban is carried on the containers that are associated with it.
* Transportation (T) Kanban: A T-kanban authorizes the transportation of the full container to the downstream workstation. The T-kanban is also carried on the containers that are associated with the transportation to move through the loop again.

The Kanban philosophy and task boards are also used in agile project management to coordinate tasks in project teams. An online demonstration can be seen in an &quot;agile&quot; simulator.

Implementation of kanban can be described in the following manner:

* The workflow consists of logical steps.
* There are two steps to a workflow viz. queue and work in progress/process.
* The team in charge decides on the maximum amount of work each step of the workflow can hold.
* Work is pushed into the queue step and pulled into the process step.
* If need be, work is halted in two successive stages to clear bottleneck.

===Kanbrain===
A third type involves corporate training. Following the just-in-time principle, computer-based training permits those who need to learn a skill to do so when the need arises, rather than take courses and lose the effectiveness of what they&#x27;ve learned from lack of practice.

<doc id="261988" wikidata="Q1334322" url="?curid=261988" title="County of Toulouse">
<text>The County of Toulouse (, , ) was a territory in present-day southern France consisting of the city of Toulouse and its environs, ruled by the Count of Toulouse from the late 9th century until the late 13th century.

After Pippin the Short conquered Septimania, his successor Charlemagne imposed an administration where Frankish counts were established in key cities such as Toulouse. The first count, Fredelo (appointed by Pippin II) ruled the Toulouse region under the sovereignty of the king of Francia in the 840s. Over time his descendants gained more power over the region compared to their Frankish overlord; by the end of the 9th century, they had gained total independence. Later in the 12th century, the county was affected by the Albigensian Crusade, and by 1229, the Treaty of Paris saw Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France, ending its independence. But the counts of Toulouse ruled Toulouse town and the surrounding county until 1271.

== History ==

=== Formation of administration under the early Carolingians ===
The Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis fell to the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century. Septimania, the Visigothic province roughly corresponding to the later county of Toulouse, fell briefly to the Emirate of Córdoba in the 750s before it was conquered into Francia by Pippin the Short in 759 following the Siege of Narbonne. Septimania within the Frankish realm would become known as &quot;Gothia&quot; or &quot;Marca Gothica&quot; by the end of the 9th century.

Pippin died in 768 and was followed by his sons Charlemagne and Carloman I. Because of this event, Hunald II, son of the late Duke Waifer, raised an insurrection against Frankish power in Aquitaine. Charlemagne soon intervened and defeated him. In 771, Carloman died and Charlemagne was left as the only ruler of the Frankish realm. In 778, Charlemagne led his army into Spain against the Arabs. On his way back the famous event of Roncesvalles (&quot;Roncevaux&quot; in French) occurred: Charlemagne&#x27;s rear-guard was attacked in the pass of the same name by some Basque warriors. This led him to realize that Frankish power in Gascony and Aquitaine was still feeble, and that the local populations were not entirely loyal to the Franks. Consequently, that same year, he completely reorganized the administration of the region: direct Frankish administration was imposed, and Frankish counts were established in key cities, such as Toulouse.

In 781, Charlemagne set up the Kingdom of Aquitaine, comprising the whole of Aquitaine (including Gascony) plus the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to Nîmes (an area then known as Gothia). Other such sub-kingdoms were created inside the wider Carolingian empire in places such as Bavaria or Lombardy. They were meant to ensure the loyalty of local populations in territories freshly conquered and with strong local idiosyncrasies.

General supervision of this Basque frontier seems to have been placed in the hands of Chorson, count or duke of Toulouse. These politics displeased the Basques, and in 787 or 789 Chorson was captured by Odalric &quot;the Basque&quot;, probably son of Duke Lupus, who forced Chorson into an agreement which Charlemagne considered so shameful that he replaced him by the Count William in 790. Toulouse was a major Carolingian military stronghold close to Muslim Spain. Military campaigns against the Muslims were launched from Toulouse almost every year during Charlemagne&#x27;s reign. Barcelona was conquered in 801, as well as a large part of Catalonia. Together with the northern areas of Aragon and Navarre along the Pyrenees, the region became the southern march (the Spanish March) of the Frankish empire.

=== Toulouse under the sons of Charlemagne ===
In 814, Charlemagne died, and his only surviving son was Louis, king of Aquitaine, who became Emperor Louis the Pious. Gothia was detached from the Kingdom of Aquitaine and administered directly by the emperor. Problems soon arose. Louis the Pious had three sons, and in 817 he arranged an early allocation of the shares in the future inheritance of the empire where Pippin was confirmed king in Aquitaine.

In 823, Charles the Bald was born from the second wife of Louis the Pious which caused a succession crisis among the ruling circle, this eventually led to the decentralization of the Frankish empire. War broke out among the sons of Louis the Pious when the latter died in 840. Louis the German allied with his half-brother Charles the Bald and they jointly defeated Lothar. The empire would split under the Treaty of Verdun in 843. Charles the Bald moved south to defeat Pippin II (son of Pippin I who was son of Louis) and add Aquitaine to his territory. He conquered Gothia from its rebellious count, who had taken advantage of the Carolingian feud, and had him executed.

In 844, he moved west and besieged Toulouse, the capital of King Pippin II of Aquitaine. However, he had to withdraw without being able to capture the city. That same year, the Vikings entered the mouth of the Garonne River, took Bordeaux, and sailed up as far as Toulouse, plundering and killing all along the Garonne River valley. They moved back when they reached Toulouse, without attacking the city. It is still a matter of debate among historians whether they were called by Pippin II in his fight against Charles the Bald (as Charles&#x27; propaganda later claimed), helped defeat Charles the Bald, and left with due payment from Pippin II of Aquitaine, or whether they just took advantage of the war to invade unchecked, but moved back at the sight of the strong garrison of Toulouse who had just resisted successfully Charles the Bald.In 845, following these events, Charles the Bald signed a treaty recognizing Pippin II as king of Aquitaine in exchange for him relinquishing the northern part of Aquitaine (the county of Poitiers) to Charles the Bald. However, the Aquitanians grew very unhappy with their king Pippin II, perhaps for his friendliness towards the Vikings who inflicted terrible damage on the population, and so in 848 they called Charles the Bald to topple Pippin II.

=== Counts of Toulouse gains power over the Carolingians ===
In 849 Charles the Bald moved south again and was presented the capital of Aquitaine, Toulouse, by Fredelo (the count of Toulouse recently appointed by Pippin II). Charles the Bald then officially confirmed Frédelon as count of Toulouse. Soon the whole of Aquitaine was submitting to Charles the Bald. In 852, Pippin II was taken prisoner by the Basques and handed over to his uncle Charles the Bald who put him in a monastery.

In 852, Count Fredelo of Toulouse died and Charles the Bald appointed Frédelon&#x27;s brother Raymond as the new count. This was a special favor, normally counts were only administrative agents not chosen in the same family. However, it would prove to be the start of the dynasty of the counts of Toulouse, who were all descendants of Count Raymond I of Toulouse. Meanwhile, Pippin II of Aquitaine had escaped from his monastery in 854, and he was raising an insurrection in Aquitaine but failed. He then resorted to calling the Vikings for help. In 864, at the head of a Viking army, Pippin II of Aquitaine besieged Toulouse where the count of Toulouse resisted fiercely. The siege failed, and the Vikings left to plunder other areas of Aquitaine. Pippin II, abandoned by all, saw the ruins of his ambitions. He was captured and again put in a monastery by his uncle, where he died soon after.

In 866, Charles the Child died. Charles the Bald then made his other son, Louis the Stammerer (&quot;Louis le Bègue&quot;), the new king of Aquitaine. By then, the central state in the kingdom of France was rapidly losing authority. Charles the Bald was rather unsuccessful at containing the Vikings; local populations had to rely on their local counts to resist the Vikings, and the counts soon became the main source of authority, challenging the central authority of Charles the Bald in Paris. As they grew in power, they started to be succeeded in the same family and establish local dynasties. Wars between the central power and the counts arose, as well as wars between the competing counts, which further debilitated the defenses against the Vikings. Western Europe, and France in particular, was again entering a new Dark Age, which would prove even more disastrous than those of the 6th and 7th centuries.

In 877, Charles the Bald had to give in: he signed the Capitulary of Quierzy, which allowed counts to be succeeded by their sons when they died. This was the founding stone of feudalism in western Europe. Charles the Bald died four months later, his so Louis the Stammerer did not choose any of his sons to become the new king of Aquitaine, thus in effect putting an end to the kingdom of Aquitaine, which would never be revived again. In practice, during the years 870–890, the central power was so weakened that the counts in southern France achieved complete autonomy. The dynasties they established ruled independently. The central state in Paris would not be able to reassert its authority over the south of France for the next four centuries.

=== Independence ===

By the end of the 9th century, Toulouse had become the capital of an independent county, the county of Toulouse, ruled by the dynasty founded by Fredelo, who in theory was under the sovereignty of the king of France, but in practice was totally independent. The counts of Toulouse had to fight to maintain their position at first. They were challenged by the dynasty of the counts of Auvergne (ruling over the northeastern part of the former Aquitaine) who claimed the county of Toulouse as their own, and even temporarily ousted the counts of Toulouse from the city of Toulouse.

On the death of Count William the Pious of Auvergne in 918 they came into the possession of Gothia which had been in the family of the counts of Auvergne for two generations. Thus, they more than doubled their territory, once again reuniting Toulouse with the Mediterranean coast from Narbonne to Nîmes. The county of Toulouse took its definite shape, from Toulouse in the west to the Rhone River in the east, a unity that would survive until the French Revolution as the province of Languedoc. Toulouse would never again be part of the Aquitaine polity, whose capital in later times would become Poitiers, then Bordeaux. Count William was the first to recreate the title of Duke of Aquitaine for himself in the 890s; then the count of Poitiers inherited the title in 927. In 932 the king of France Raoul was fighting against the count of Poitiers, and he transferred the title of Duke of Aquitaine to his new ally Count Raymond III Pons of Toulouse. However, the counts of the former Aquitaine all ruled independently, and did not recognize a superior authority.

Various factions were competing for the throne of France, but since all central authority had disappeared, the position of King of France had become an almost empty title. After Raoul&#x27;s death, another faction succeeded in establishing an English bred Carolingian prince to the throne, Louis IV. Raymond III Pons was from the opposite faction and so when he died in 950 Louis IV awarded the title of Duke of Aquitaine to Count William III Towhead of Poitiers who was an ally of Louis IV. From then on the title of Duke of Aquitaine would be used in the family of the counts of Poitiers, whose power base of Poitou was in the northwestern part of the former Aquitaine. The counts of Toulouse would soon forget any dreams about Aquitaine. Eventually, on the death of the Carolingian king of France Louis V in 987, the Robertian faction succeeded in having its chief, Hugh Capet elected to the French throne. This time, the Carolingian dynasty effectively ended. Hugh Capet was the founder the Capetian dynasty, which would rule in France for the next eight centuries. However, from this point forward, the history of France is irrelevant to Toulouse, at least until the 13th century.

=== 10th century ===
The counts of Toulouse had extended their rule to the Mediterranean coast, but they would not long enjoy the large domain they had succeeded in carving out for themselves. The 10th century was perhaps the worst century for western Europe in the last two millennia. This conjugated with dramatic civil wars, bad weather, plagues, and population loss. Entire areas of western Europe returned to wilderness and cities were depopulated. Another phenomenon was the complete disappearance of central authority where power fragmented.

By the end of the 10th century, France was ruled by thousands of local rulers who controlled only one town, or one castle and the few villages around. Toulouse and its county was exactly reflecting this situation. Between 900 and 980 the counts of Toulouse gradually lost control over the county, with the emergence of local dynastic rulers in every part of it. By the end of the 10th century the counts of Toulouse only had authority over a few estates scattered around the county. Even the city of Toulouse was ruled by a viscount independent from the counts of Toulouse.

Abd al-Rahman III of Córdoba managed to reunite Muslim Spain and launched an offensive against the northern Christian kingdoms and went as far north as Toulouse, without capturing the city. In 924, the Magyars (ancestors of the Hungarians) launched an expedition toward the west and went as far as Toulouse, but they were defeated by Count Raymond III Pons of Toulouse. At the end of the 10th century all the Carolingian wars and subsequent invasions had left the county of Toulouse in disarray. However, Toulouse was perhaps faring a little better than northern France in the sense that its proximity to Muslim Spain meant there was a strong flow of knowledge and culture coming from the schools and printing houses of Córdoba. Toulouse had also retained Roman Law unlike northern France, and had in general kept more of the Roman legacy, even in these troubled times. The ground was there for a recovery of civilization.

=== 11th–12th century ===
At the beginning of the second millennium, the drifting attitude of the clergy and the confiscation of the Church by the Toulouse administration initiated a degradation of the worship. The Saint-Sernin church, the Daurade basilica, and the Saint-Étienne cathedral were not maintained properly. New religious currents appeared, like the Cluniac reform. Bishop Isarn, helped by Pope Gregory VII, tried to put everything back in order. He gave the Daurade Basilica to the Cluniac abbots in 1077. In Saint-Sernin, he met a strong opposition in the person of Raimond Gayrard, a provost who had just built a hospital for the poor and was proposing to build a basilica.

Supported by count Guilhem IV, Saint Raymond finally gained permission from Pope Urban II to dedicate the building in 1096. The religious quarrels had just awoken the faith of Toulouse. This rebirth was accompanied by a new demographic progression, supported by technically more efficient agriculture.

The suburbs of Saint-Michel and Saint Cyprien were built during this period. The Daurade bridge connected in 1181 the Saint-Cyprien suburb to the gates of the city. The suburbs of Saint-Sernin and Saint-Pierre des Cuisines also had a remarkable expansion.

The end of the 11th century marked the departure of count Raymond IV to the crusades. Various succession wars followed, besieging Toulouse several times. In 1119, the population of Toulouse proclaimed Alphonse Jourdain count. Alphonse Jourdain, willing to be grateful to his people, reduced the taxes immediately, for example on salt and wine.From the middle years of the 12th century, the people of Toulouse seem to have begun to free themselves from the most oppressive feudal dues. With the death of the count, an administration of eight &quot;capitulaires&quot; was created. Under the direction of the count, they had the responsibility of regulating the exchanges and making sure the laws were applied. These were the Capitouls, whose first acts were dated in 1152. In 1152 we have traces of a &quot;commune consilium Tolosae&quot; making police ordinances in its own name &quot;with the advice of Lord Raymond, count of Toulouse, duke of Narbonne, and marquis of Provence&quot;. This act was witnessed by six &quot;capitularii&quot;, four duly appointed judges (&quot;judices constiluti&quot;), and two advocates. Twenty-three years later there were twelve &quot;capitularii&quot; or consuls, six for the city and six for its suburbs, all of them elected and sworn to do justice in whatever municipal matters were brought before them.

In 1176, the &quot;chapitre&quot; already had twelve members, each of them representing a district of Toulouse, or a suburb. The consuls quickly opposed count Raimond V. The population of Toulouse was divided on the subject and in 1189, after ten years of fighting, the town council finally obtained the submission of the count.

In 1190 the construction of the future Capitole, the common house, the town council headquarters began. With twenty-four members, probably elected, the Capitouls granted themselves the rights of police, trade, imposition and started some conflicts with the closest cities. Toulouse was usually victorious, extending the domination of the &quot;patria tolosana&quot;. Despite the intervention of the king, the administration of the Capitouls gave a relative independence to the city, for nearly 600 years, until the French Revolution.

In 1222 the number of capitularii was increased to twenty-four; but they were forbidden to touch the city property, which was to remain in the charge of certain &quot;communarii&quot; chosen by themselves.

==== Albigensian Crusade ====

 Catharism is a doctrine professing the separation of the material and the spiritual existences, one of its possible inspiration may be Bogomilism of Bulgaria. It conflicts with the orthodox confession. Called &quot;heretics&quot;, the Cathars found a strong audience in the south of France, and during the 12th century. Simon de Montfort tried to exterminate them.

Toulouse was reached by the Cathar doctrine too. The orthodox White Brotherhood pursued the heretical Blacks in the streets of the city. The abbot of Foulques took advantage of this because the heretics were his creditors, and encouraged this inquisition.

Some people joined the white fighters, others chose to assist the besieged population. The consuls did not wish to encourage the division of Toulouse, and defied the pontifical authority, refusing to identify the heretics. Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, a Catholic, who was excommunicated for his dispute with the pope, later sympathised with the heretics because he saw the crusade take an unholy path with the extermination at Bézier.

In 1211, the first siege of Toulouse by Simon de Montfort was unsuccessful but two years later, he successfully defeated the Toulouse army. Though Simon was practically the Count of Toulouse by 1214, it was not until Pope Innocent III&#x27;s decision following the Fourth Council of the Lateran in November 1215 that it was made official.

Simon de Montfort was killed by a stone at the Siege of Toulouse in 1218. Until the last siege, the &quot;whites&quot; were fought against by the Toulouse populace. Louis VIII finally decided to give up in 1219. Raymond VI recognized the support he had received from the population, helping him to preserve his interests, gave up his last prerogatives to the Capitouls.

=== Within the Kingdom of France ===
The 13th century went in a political direction opposite to the path drawn by the past centuries. In the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county&#x27;s sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan&#x27;s death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.

Also in 1229, the University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of &quot;frères prêcheurs&quot;, were started. They found a home in &quot;Les Jacobins&quot;. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the walls of Toulouse. The fear of repression obliged the notabilities to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.

Count Raimond VII was convicted of heresy and died in 1249 without an heir. The Toulouse county was given to the king of France, who imposed his laws through appointed seneschals. The power of the Capitouls was reduced.

In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was established in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours. Toulouse became the center of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years; the Consistori was last active in 1484.

Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles.

Accompanying the inquisition, many threats affected the city. Plague, fire and flood devastated the districts. The Hundred Years&#x27; War decimated Toulouse. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. Toulouse only had 22,000 people in 1405.

== Women&#x27;s rights ==
As a successor state of the Visigothic Kingdom and the Duchy of Aquitaine, Toulouse, along with the Aquitaine region and Languedoc (but not Gascony), inherited Visigothic Law and Roman Law which had combined to allow women more rights than their contemporaries would enjoy until the 20th century. Particularly with the Liber Judiciorum as codified in 642/643 and expanded on in the Code of Recceswinth in 653, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, and women could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20. As a consequence, male-preference primogeniture was the practiced succession law for the nobility.

== Counts of Toulouse ==
Under the Carolingians, counts and dukes were appointed by the royal court. Later, this office became hereditary. The counts of Toulouse ruled the city of Toulouse and its surrounding county from the late 9th century until 1271. At times, the counts of Toulouse or family members were also counts of Quercy, Rouergue, Albi, Nîmes, Provence and marquesses of Gothia.

<text>The Tin Mine Falls is a cascade waterfall located in the remote Pilot Wilderness Area within the Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales, Australia. Described from top to bottom, the falls consist of non-segmented tiered cascades over bedrock with a few smaller plunges, followed by a single large plunge into a pool. The falls are recessed into a &quot;punchbowl&quot; feature making it impossible to view the entire waterfall from a single location on the ground.

== Location and features ==

The falls are located in remote country within the Kosciuszko National Park. The closest access point is the Cascade Fire Trail, a hiking trail that runs south from the Alpine Way, west of Thredbo Village.

The height of Tin Mine Falls is listed as or , and quote a story concerning the origin of this figure: &quot;The falls were apparently measured in 1990 by a Dr. John Pease ... using a plumb line&quot;. According to the World Waterfall Database, Tin Mine Falls is the 462nd tallest waterfall in the world, with a total height of . Official data from Geoscience Australia list the most significant waterfalls in Australia as:
* Wallaman Falls - Queensland, 305m
* Wollomombi Falls - New South Wales, with a single drop
* Ellenborough Falls - New South Wales in a single drop

The estimated height of corresponds with topography but contradicts Geoscience Australia&#x27;s list of the tallest waterfalls in Australia (this would make Tin Mine Falls the 3rd highest on the continent). Unless the upper limit of the falls is fixed well upstream, to include a long section of shallow-slope non-bedrock streambed, the rumoured height of cannot be substantiated.

<text>Sutherland Falls is a waterfall near Milford Sound in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The falls are located 13.5nm South West of Chao Pass. At 580 metres (1,904 feet) the falls are the tallest waterfall in New Zealand.

The water falls from Lake Quill in three cascades: the upper is 229 m tall, the middle is 248 m, and the lower is 103 m tall. A vertical fall of 580 m is made over 480 m of horizontal distance, thus the mean grade of falls is approximately 56 degrees. 

The base of Sutherland Falls is a 90-minute (return) walk from Quintin Public Shelter on the Milford Track.

Sutherland Falls are visible in the background of the eagle scene in Peter Jackson&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

== History ==
Sutherland Falls was first known to Europeans when a Scottish settler, Donald Sutherland, saw them in 1880. He initially claimed the falls were over tall, which would have made them the highest in the world by far. Later surveys showed that this claim was significantly inflated, and they have been confirmed to actually be tall.

Lake Quill, which forms the source of the falls, was named for the first European explorer who climbed up the cliff face to find it in 1890.

<text>A monochrome or monochromatic image, object or palette is composed of one color (or values of one color). Images using only shades of grey are called grayscale (typically digital) or black-and-white (typically analog). In physics, [[Monochromatic radiation|monochromatic light]] refers to electromagnetic radiation that contains a narrow band of wavelengths, which is a distinct concept.

==Application==
Of an image, the term monochrome is usually taken to mean the same as black and white or, more likely, grayscale, but may also be used to refer to other combinations containing only tones of a single color, such as green-and-white or green-and-red. It may also refer to sepia displaying tones from light tan to dark brown or cyanotype (&quot;blueprint&quot;) images, and early photographic methods such as daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, and tintypes, each of which may be used to produce a monochromatic image.

In computing, monochrome has two meanings:

* it may mean having only one color which is either on or off (also known as a binary image), 
* allowing shades of that color.

A monochrome computer display is able to display only a single color, often green, amber, red or white, and often also shades of that color.

In film photography, monochrome is typically the use of black-and-white film. Originally, all photography was done in monochrome. Although color photography was possible even in the late 19th century, easily used color films, such as Kodachrome, were not available until the mid-1930s.

In digital photography, monochrome is the capture of only shades of black by the sensor, or by post-processing a color image to present only the perceived brightness by combining the values of multiple channels (usually red, blue, and green). The weighting of individual channels may be selected to achieve a desired artistic effect; if only the red channel is selected by the weighting then the effect will be similar to that of using a red filter on panchromatic film. If the red channel is eliminated and the green and blue combined then the effect will be similar to that of orthochromatic film or the use of a cyan filter on panchromatic film. The selection of weighting so provides a wide variety of artistic expression in the final monochrome image.

For production of an anaglyph image the original color stereogram source may first be reduced to monochrome in order to simplify the rendering of the image. This is sometimes required in cases where a color image would render in a confusing manner given the colors and patterns present in the source image and the selection filters used (typically red and its complement, cyan).

==Color scheme==


A monochromatic color scheme comprises (tones, tints, and shades) of a single hue. Tints are achieved by adding white, thereby increasing lightness; Shades are achieved by adding black, thereby decreasing lightness; Tones are achieved by adding gray, thereby decreasing colorfulness.

Monochromatic color schemes provide opportunities in art and visual communications design as they allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be used to attract attention, create focus and support legibility.

The use of a monochromatic color provides a strong sense of visual cohesion and can help support communication objectives through the use of connotative color. The relative absence of hue contrast can be offset by variations in tone and the addition of texture.

Monochromatic in science means consisting of a single wavelength of light or other radiation (lasers, for example, usually produce monochromatic light), or having or appearing to have only one color (in comparison to polychromatic). That means according to science the true monochromatic images can be strictly created only of shades of one color fading to black.

However, monochromatic also has another meaning similar to “boring” or “colorless” which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades (one hue fading to black), and the colors created from the one hue but faded to all wavelengths (to white). This is not monochromatic in the strictly scientific meaning of the word. In fact, monochrome in the art world can be as complicated or even more complicated than other polychromatic art.

==In physics==
In physics, monochromatic light is electromagnetic radiation of a single wavelength. While no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic, in practice, it is usually used to describe very narrowband sources such as monochromated or laser light. The degree of monochromaticity can be defined by the spectral linewidth). A device which isolates a narrow band of light from a broadband source is called a monochromator.

<text>The siege of Port Hudson (May 22 – July 9, 1863) was the final engagement in the Union campaign to recapture the Mississippi River in the American Civil War. While Union General Ulysses Grant was besieging Vicksburg upriver, General Nathaniel Banks was ordered to capture the lower Mississippi Confederate stronghold of Port Hudson, Louisiana, to go to Grant&#x27;s aid. When his assault failed, Banks settled into a 48-day siege, the longest in US military history up to that point. A second attack also failed, and it was only after the fall of Vicksburg that the Confederate commander, General Franklin Gardner, surrendered the port. The Union gained control of the river and navigation from the Gulf of Mexico through the Deep South and to the river&#x27;s upper reaches.

==Background==

===Strategy and politics on the Mississippi===
From the time the American Civil War started in April 1861, both the U.S. and Confederates made controlling the Mississippi River a major part of their strategy. The Confederacy wanted to keep using the river to transport needed supplies; the Union wanted to stop this supply route and drive a wedge that would divide Confederate states and territories. Particularly important to the South was the stretch of the Mississippi that included the mouth of the Red River. The Red was the Confederacy&#x27;s primary route for moving vital supplies between east and west: salt, cattle, and horses traveled downstream from the Trans-Mississippi West; in the opposite direction flowed men and munitions from the east.

In the spring and early summer of 1862, the Union advanced their control of the Mississippi from both the north and the south. From the mouth of the river, a fleet commanded by Flag Officer David G. Farragut fought its way through Confederate fortifications in the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, resulting in the capture of New Orleans. A second Union fleet commanded by Charles H. Davis occupied Memphis, Tennessee, after defeating Confederate riverine forces in the First Battle of Memphis. To make sure it could continue to use the middle section of the river, the South fortified positions at both Vicksburg and Port Hudson.

The initial idea of fortifying the heights of Port Hudson came from the south&#x27;s master of fixed defenses, General Pierre G.T. Beauregard, Commander, Army of the Mississippi. Writing to Major General Mansfield Lovell, Commander of the lower Mississippi in March 1862, Beauregard recommended, &quot;...the fortification of Port Hudson as a measure of precaution against the fall of our defenses north of Memphis.&quot; In June 1862, Major General Earl Van Dorn wrote Jefferson Davis: &quot;I want Baton Rouge and Port Hudson&quot;. A few days after the fall of Baton Rouge to the Union, Confederate General John C. Breckinridge with 4,000 men, carried out the wishes of General Van Dorn by occupying Port Hudson, situated between Baton Rouge and Bayou Sara, with troops under the command of General Daniel Ruggles. Soldiers of the 4th Louisiana Infantry arrived at the site on August 15, 1862.

According to historian John D. Winters, &quot;Port Hudson, unlike Baton Rouge, was one of the strongest points on the river, and batteries placed upon the bluffs could command the entire river front.&quot; It was a position similar to that of Quebec City on the St. Lawrence River in the French and Indian War.

The political momentum behind the Union actions against Port Hudson came from the elections of November 1862. The Republican base, centered in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, had been shaken by embarrassing Democratic victories. A dramatic letter from Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton to Lincoln claimed that &quot;The fate of the North-West is trembling in the balance.&quot; His implication was that unless the independent trade of Union states along the Ohio River was restored by Union control of the entire Mississippi, further breakup of the Union was possible. Morton believed the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were in danger of breaking away from the Northeast to join the Confederacy, which was increasingly becoming the more lucrative opportunity. In addition, the southern areas of these states had been settled by people from the South, many of whom maintained their identification with that region and its culture.

The threat of political fractures galvanized the Lincoln administration into action. Major General Nathanial Banks was diverted from a possible expedition to Texas and given Benjamin Butler&#x27;s command of the Department of the Gulf. The Union commander of all armies, Henry Wager Halleck, said to Banks that President Lincoln &quot;regards the opening of the Mississippi River as the first and most important of all our military and naval operations, and it is hoped that you will not lose a moment in accomplishing it.&quot; On December 4, 1862, Banks and his expedition put to sea for New Orleans.

In May 1863, Union land and naval forces began a campaign they hoped would give them control of the full length of the Mississippi River. One army under Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant commenced operations against the Confederacy&#x27;s fortified position at Vicksburg at the northern end of the stretch of the river still in Southern hands, while another army under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks simultaneously attacked Port Hudson at the southern end.

===Foundation of a fortress===
Port Hudson was sited on an bluff on the east bank above a hairpin turn in the Mississippi River upriver from Baton Rouge. The hills and ridges in the area of the town represented extremely rough terrain, a maze of deep, thickly forested ravines, swamps, and cane brakes creating a natural fortress. The town was a port for shipping cotton and sugar downriver from the surrounding area. Despite its importance, the city had only a few buildings and 200 people at the start of the war. The river had shifted south and the docks had been moved about south.

In 1862, a railroad was constructed to the town of Clinton, to the northeast. The entire length of the Port Hudson and Clinton railroad was . It did not connect with the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern railroad that connected Louisiana with other states and with Camp Moore, the main mustering point for Confederate forces in the department. Also by 1862 the railroad was run down, the track consisting of strips of iron nailed flat to rotten ties. The entire rolling stock consisted of one locomotive, one passenger car, and six box and flat cars. This train could accommodate only a few hundred troops at the most and was inadequate for hauling heavy guns and their ammunition. This lack of transport independent of the river would limit the defensibility of Port Hudson.

Initial plans for fortifications were drawn up with the assistance of Captain James Nocquet, chief engineer for General Breckinridge. Along with loaning his engineering staff, Breckinridge also authorized Ruggles to gather needed supplies and tools using the Clinton and Port Hudson railroad, and whatever labor the area could provide for construction. Three different layouts for earthworks were considered: a central fort mounting cannon supported by angled outworks, a line of lunettes arranged along a line, and a continuous ring of redoubts, trenches, and parapets surrounding the entire position.

The first option was rejected for concentrating the positions armament into too small a target, and thus making it too vulnerable to bombardment. The third option was rejected because a siege was considered unlikely, and the task of building such extensive works too ambitious since the circumference of the ring would have been eight miles (13 km.) and required 35,000 men and 70 pieces of artillery for defense. The line of lunettes was determined to be the best plan for the defense of the Port Hudson heights, and construction started on a line of seven fronting the river.

General Breckinridge was soon ordered to take most of his troops to Kentucky, however, and on August 18 he left, leaving only 1,500 men to work on the fortifications under Ruggles&#x27;s command. Ruggles did have a forty-two-pounder smoothbore cannon, which he mounted immediately, manned by former sailors of the CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot;, which had been destroyed in the Battle of Baton Rouge that year. Two thirty-two-pounders were shortly added from the abandoned wreck of the .

===Union Navy assesses the defenses===

General Ruggles was ordered to turn over command of Port Hudson to Brigadier General William Nelson Rector Beall on August 29, 1862, and take some of his troops to Mississippi. This was the day that the Union Navy began to contest the guns of Port Hudson for control of the Mississippi. The improvised Union gunboat USS &quot;Anglo-American&quot;, a wooden side-wheel steamboat, passed Port Hudson moving upriver to join with Commander David Dixon Porter&#x27;s fleet at Vicksburg. Although struck many times by shot from Port Hudson, it was unable to return fire due to wet cartridges and an ammunition shortage. The &quot;Anglo-American&quot; joined Porter&#x27;s fleet and reported the fortifications at Port Hudson.
Porter responded to the new threat by bombarding the Rebel position with the and the &quot;Anglo-American&quot; on September 7. The Union fleet did little damage to Port Hudson, but the &quot;Essex&quot; received significant damage. Porter reported 35 to 40 heavy guns at Port Hudson, a considerable exaggeration. During the lull in action when the Union delayed bringing more ships into the area, Beall slowly expanded the fortifications. This work was slowed because of interference from Union-controlled portions of the river and the inadequate rail and road system supporting his position. By this time, Confederate President Jefferson Davis realized that connecting the Port Hudson and Clinton railway to Jackson, Mississippi, would be invaluable in allowing reserves to be switched between Vicksburg and Port Hudson, depending upon which was most threatened. A desperate shortage of iron and transport within the Confederacy made such construction impossible. Beall asked Davis to impose martial law in the region of Port Hudson in order to commandeer more workers for construction, but Davis denied this also.

Beall endeavored to set up a hospital at Centenary College at Jackson Louisiana for invalided troops from Port Hudson and Clinton, but the space proved inadequate. Confederate bureaucracy had made it difficult for Garrison Provost Marshal John C. Miller to construct a logistical system of warehouses and transports to supply the garrison with food, medical supplies, barracks, bedding, and other material necessary for their health. The use of earthworks for fortification, which required unending labor to maintain and were unhealthful to live in, also contributed to the poor health of the garrison.

Poor supply lines, starvation, and disease were to remain the constant problems of the Port Hudson position, and overwhelm efforts to improve conditions for the soldiers of the garrison. Louisiana Private Robert D. Patrick wrote: &quot;...never since I have been in the army have I fared so badly and in truth I have been almost starved.&quot; At the same time commercial activity between Port Hudson and areas west of the Mississippi increased, because Port Hudson became the sole remaining link with the Trans-Mississippi. This tended to tie up even more of Port Hudson&#x27;s limited transport facilities.

===Changes of command===

Lincoln&#x27;s new commander of the Gulf, Nathaniel P. Banks, arrived in New Orleans on December 14, 1862, with the 31,000 men of his expedition. The former commander, Benjamin Butler left for Lowell, Massachusetts on December 24, but his 12,000 troops remained behind. This effectively more than doubled U.S. troop strength in the Gulf area. Banks ordered them to re-occupy Baton Rouge on December 17.

The Confederate command reacted to this increased Union commitment by sending a newly promoted major general to take command of Port Hudson. Major General Franklin Gardner arrived at his post on December 27, 1862. Gardner was a career Army officer who graduated from West Point 17th in his class in 1843. The native New Yorker commanded a cavalry brigade at Shiloh and was 39 years old at the time of his arrival. Upon taking command he reorganized the defenses at Port Hudson, concentrating the fields of fire of the heavy guns and rapidly setting up more earthworks by using packed earth and sod rather than the traditional gabions or sandbags.

Lacking an adequate engineering staff, he promoted Private Henry Glinder, formerly a member of the United States Coast Survey, to first lieutenant of engineers. He also increased the efficiency of the supply and storage operations, along with building protected roads within the defense system to speed the movement of troops to threatened positions. His energy in making improvements and promoting those worthy of command made him popular with his troops, and improved garrison morale. Despite the changes, Colonel Charles M. Fauntleroy, inspector-general for the department, criticized the fortifications for containing excessive numbers of civilians, badly placed magazines, poor transport and storage of grain, and no system for paying the troops on time.

As Gardner strengthened his command, and gathered reinforcements from Pemberton sent by steamboat from Vicksburg, Banks dithered in New Orleans. He had little faith in the system of organization and military government left by Butler&#x27;s command and spent much time re-organizing the Union administration and establishing a more relaxed civil government to placate former Confederate backers in the city. Banks was a &quot;political general&quot; and felt more comfortable with political organizing and social affairs than leading armies into the field against reputedly formidable fortifications. This lack of military zeal was noted by his officers. Colonel Sidney A. Bean recorded in his diary that under Butler, &quot;much was accomplished with small means. Now nothing is accomplished with great means.&quot; The Union leader most offended by this apparent inertia was Rear Admiral David G. Farragut of the U.S. Navy. Although Banks reluctantly agreed to move against Port Hudson, his slow progress and the increased Rebel activity on the Mississippi in the area of Port Hudson caused Farragut&#x27;s patience to run out. In March 1863 Farragut prepared to confront Port Hudson without Army support.

===Farragut&#x27;s fleet passes Port Hudson===
Farragut had gathered his attack force by March 13, 1863. This fleet consisted of four principal warships and three gunboats. The principal warships were the sloops-of-war , , and and the steam paddle frigate . The gunboats were , , and . Farragut commanded this fleet from his flagship, &quot;Hartford&quot;. The first six vessels were lashed together in an attack column of pairs, with &quot;Mississippi&quot; bringing up the rear by herself.

Farragut had made fairly elaborate preparations of the vessels themselves for a night attack resembling the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Phillip, clearing the ships for action, whitewashing the gun decks to improve visibility for night action, and bringing up mortar boats for support. He also had the anchor chains of the attacking ships lashed to the sides of the attack ships as improvised armor. He did not however, make the systematic survey of defenses and sustained bombardment that supported the battle for the passage of the forts guarding New Orleans.

The Confederate fortress was ready for the attack, having noticed increased naval activity downriver, and the ranging shots of the six mortar schooners which covered the advance of the Union fleet near Prophet″s Island, three miles (4.3 km) downriver from Port Hudson. At this time the Confederates had over twenty cannon covering the river arranged in eleven batteries of artillery, including nine batteries of heavy coastal artillery. Lieutenant Colonel Marshall J. Smith commanded these heavy guns, and had instructed the gun crews of his plans before the battle.

Battery Number Seven was a heated shot position, using ammunition particularly effective against wooden warships. Other preparations included preparing piles of pine wood to be ignited to illuminate the river for night action, and observation posts near the river to fire rockets to warn of the approach of enemy vessels. The first of these rockets was fired at 11:20 pm on March 14, 1863, at the approach of Farragut&#x27;s fleet. Instantly an eight-inch (203-mm) smoothbore shell from Battery 9 was fired at &quot;Albatross&quot;, beginning the battle. The Union fleet advanced steadily upriver, beginning a general fire of broadsides as soon as their guns bore on the lower Confederate batteries on the Port Hudson slopes. The heavier Confederate guns, mounted over the walls of the seven lunettes on the crest of the bluffs, had difficulty aiming at the ships, which were hugging the shorelines of the bluffs in order to avoid shoals on the western shore near the curve of the river north of Port Hudson.

Coarse black powder was the artillery propellant of the period, and produced dense clouds of white smoke when fired from cannon. Combined with the smoke of the pine wood illumination fires, and the darkness of the night attack, the river valley was rapidly obscured. Blinded by the dense smoke, &quot;Hartford&quot; and &quot;Albatross&quot; ran aground on the eastern shore beneath the Rebel batteries. Despite remaining aground for ten minutes, the two lashed-together lead ships had passed the last Confederate gun position by 12:15 am and were out of range of Port Hudson by 12:45 am.

The rest of the fleet was not so lucky. &quot;Genesee&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot; were next in the column. A trick of the wind cleared the smoke momentarily between the batteries and the ships, and &quot;Richmond&quot; was hammered by Rebel shot and shell. Just as &quot;Richmond&quot; made the turn in the river north of Port Hudson, a 6.4-inch (163 mm) solid conical shot tore through the starboard side, smashing both port and starboard boiler safety valves. This cut power to the engines and filled the ship with clouds of escaping steam. &quot;Genesee&quot; alone did not have enough power to stem the current, and both ships drifted back downriver.

&quot;Monongahela&quot; and &quot;Kineo&quot; were next in the column, and, also blinded by smoke, ran aground on the western shore. The impact separated the two ships. The stress of backing off the shore disabled &quot;Monongahela&quot;″s engine, and a thirty-two-pounder (14.5 kg) round shot split &quot;Kineo&quot;″s rudder post, disabling her steering. Both ships drifted downriver.

&quot;Mississippi&quot; was last in line and also ran aground on the western shore. The large steam paddle frigate was an irresistible target, and was riddled with shot, shell, and hot shot. The vessel being afire in many places, with flames endangering the magazine, Captain Smith ordered her abandoned. The garrison of Port Hudson cheered loudly as the ship went up in flames and drifted loose from the shore and back downriver at about 3 am, panicking the remainder of the Union fleet downriver at the threat of her magazine exploding. At 5:05 am &quot;Mississippi&quot; disappeared in a terrific explosion, seen in New Orleans nearly 80 miles (129 km.) downriver.

Though &quot;Hartford&quot; and &quot;Albatross&quot; passed upriver to blockade the Red River, General Gardner and the Port Hudson garrison regarded the battle as a victory. They had sustained only three enlisted men killed and three officers and nineteen men wounded, compared to the seventy-eight killed or missing and thirty-five wounded on the Union fleet. The blockade of the Red River also had little effect on the strength of the Port Hudson position.

===Banks&#x27;s army moves against the fortress===
After the naval attack, Banks retreated the 17,000 troops he had intended as a diversion to support Farragut back to Baton Rouge. The lack of an attack against Port Hudson, and a powerful rainstorm endured on the retreat lowered morale in the Union force. Other than sporadic naval bombardments against Port Hudson, Banks, under pressure from Washington to show progress, launched a campaign against Major General Taylor&#x27;s Confederate forces in western Louisiana and gained control of Alexandria and a foothold on the Red River. What finally brought him to leading an attack directly against Port Hudson was the prospect of reinforcements from Grant&#x27;s army arrayed against Vicksburg, and word that a significant part of the Port Hudson garrison had been sent to Pemberton in Vicksburg.

On May 11, 1863, the 3rd Louisiana Native Guards, one of Butler&#x27;s black regiments, began building bridges to support the movement of Banks&#x27;s forces against Port Hudson. Leading the advance was the cavalry brigade of Colonel Benjamin Henry Grierson, which had joined Banks&#x27;s forces on May 2 after their famous raid through the Rebel lines. The entire advance involved a pincer movement with three army divisions advancing from the northwest from Bayou Sara meeting two divisions advancing from the south from Baton Rouge. The meeting of the two groups would surround Port Hudson.

One of Banks&#x27;s lead divisions from Baton Rouge encountered Confederates on May 21 at the Battle of Plains Store. The Confederates were driven back, and by May 22, Banks&#x27;s forces, which increased in strength from 30,000 to 40,000 men as the operation progressed, had completed an investment of the Port Hudson defenses. Banks hoped to overrun the entrenchments quickly, then take his army northward to assist Grant at Vicksburg.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
===Confederate===
==The fighting and siege==

===The first infantry assault===
Sieges and the assault of fortified positions are probably the most complex and demanding of military operations. The foremost authority on these matters at the time of the civil war was still the seventeenth century French engineer, the Marquis de Vauban, who designed many European fortification systems, and organized many successful sieges. The Confederate earthworks of Port Hudson, and their use of artillery lunettes show his influence.

General Gardner reinforced the picket lines shielding the Confederate grain mill and support shops of the areas near Little Sandy Creek, previously left unfortified because he had not considered a siege probable. Other Confederate troops remained outside the fortifications, consisting of 1200 troops under the command of Colonel John L. Logan. These represented all of Gardner&#x27;s cavalry, the 9th Louisiana Battalion, Partisan Rangers, and two artillery pieces of Robert&#x27;s battery. These troops slowed the encirclement of Banks troops, and prevented them from discovering the weaknesses in the defenses. Due to these delays, the infantry assault was scheduled for May 27, 1863, five days after the encirclement and time enough for Gardner to complete the ring of defenses around Port Hudson. He also had sufficient time to move artillery from the river side of the fort to the east side fronting the Federal forces.

===Weitzel&#x27;s morning attacks===

Banks had set up his headquarters at Riley&#x27;s plantation and planned the attacks with his staff and division commanders. Many were opposed to the idea of trying to overwhelm the fort with a simple assault, but Banks wanted to end the siege as quickly as possible in order to support Grant, and felt that the 30,000 troops available to him would easily force the surrender of the 7,500 troops under Gardner, a four to one advantage. Four different assault groups were organized, under the commands of generals Godfrey Weitzel, Cuvier Grover, Christopher C. Augur, and Thomas W. Sherman (often mistakenly identified as a relative of General William Tecumseh Sherman). Banks did not choose a specific time for his intended simultaneous assault however, ordering his commanders to &quot;...commence at the earliest hour practicable.&quot;

The effect of this was to break up the attack, with generals Weitzel and Grover attacking on the north and northeast sides of the fort at dawn, and generals Augur and Sherman attacking on the east and southeast sides at noon. The naval bombardment began the night before the attack, the 13&quot; (330 mm) mortars firing most of the evening, and the upper and lower fleets beginning firing for an hour after 7 am. The army land batteries also fired an hour bombardment after 5:30 am. Weitzel&#x27;s two divisions began the attack at 6 am on the north, advancing through the densely forested ravines bordering the valley of Little Sandy Creek. This valley led the assault into a salient formed by a fortified ridge known as the &quot;bull pen&quot; where the defenders slaughtered cattle, and a lunette on a ridge nicknamed &quot;Fort Desperate&quot; which had been hastily improvised to protect the fort&#x27;s grain mill.

At the end of this ravine between the two was a hill described as &quot;commissary hill&quot; with an artillery battery mounted on it. The Union troops were caught in a crossfire from these three positions, and held in place by dense vegetation and obstacles placed by rebel troops that halted their advance. The combination of rugged terrain, a crossfire from three sides, and rebel sharpshooters inflicted many casualties. The Union troops advancing west of the bull pen were made up of Fearing&#x27;s brigade. These soldiers were caught between the bull pen, which had been reinforced with the 14th, 18th, and 23rd Arkansas regiments from the east side of Port Hudson, and a more western fortified ridge manned by Lieutenant Colonel M. B. Locke&#x27;s Alabama troops. Once again the combination of steep sided ravines, dense vegetation, and a rebel crossfire from ridge top trenches halted the Union advance. Premature shell bursts from the supporting artillery of the 1st Maine Battery also caused Union casualties.

Seeing that his advance had been stopped, Brigadier General William Dwight ordered the 1st and 3rd Louisiana Native Guard forward into the attack. These troops were not intended to take part in the attack due to the general prejudice against African-American troops on the part of the Union high command. Dwight was determined to break through the Confederate fortifications however, and committed them to the attack at 10 am. Since they had been deployed as pioneers, working on the pontoon bridge over Big Sandy Creek near its junction with the Mississippi, these troops were in the worst possible position for an attack of all the units in Weitzel&#x27;s northern assault group.

The Guard first had to advance over the pontoon bridge, along Telegraph Road with a fortified ridge to their left manned by William B. Shelby&#x27;s 39th Mississippi troops supported by a light artillery battery, the Confederate heavy artillery batteries to their front, and the Mississippi river to their immediate right. Despite the heavy crossfire from rifles, field artillery, and heavy coast guns, the Louisiana Native Guards advanced with determination and courage, led by Captain Andre Cailloux, a free black citizen of New Orleans. Giving orders in English and French, Cailloux led the Guard regiments forward until killed by artillery fire. Taking heavy losses, the attackers were forced to retreat to avoid annihilation. This fearless advance did much to dissipate the belief that black troops were unreliable under fire.

In an attempt to support Weitzel&#x27;s unsuccessful assault, Brigadier Grover, commanding the northeast attack on the fortress, sent two of his regiments along the road leading northeast from Commissary Hill to assault Fort Desperate. This group had no more success than Weitzel&#x27;s troops, so Grover sent three more regiments to attack the stubborn 15th Arkansas troops defending the fort. These piecemeal and sporadic efforts were also futile, and the fighting ended on the northern edge of the fortress by noon.

===Thomas Sherman&#x27;s afternoon attacks===

While the infantry attacks raged against the northern section of the fortress, Brigadier General Sherman lined up 30 cannon opposite the eastern side of the fortress and conducted a steady bombardment of the rebel works and battery positions, supported by sharpshooters aiming for Confederate artillery crews. This effort had some success, but General Banks, upon hearing no rifle fire from the Union center, visited Sherman&#x27;s headquarters and threatened to relieve him of command unless he advanced his troops. Sherman then began the attack on the eastern edge of the Port Hudson works at about 2 pm.

These attacks included the troops of Augur as well as his own, and had less in the way of natural terrain obstacles to contend with, but in this area the Confederates had more time to construct fortifications, and had put more effort and firepower into them. One feature of the earthworks in this region was a dry moat and more abatis or cut down trees in front of the parapet. The Union attackers therefore carried axes, poles, planks, cotton bags and fascines to fill in the ditch. Another feature of the rebel defense was a battery containing two 24-pounder smoothbore (5.82-inch, 148 mm bore) as canister throwers.

In this case the canister was composed of broken chains, segments of railroad rails, and other scrap iron. Confederate Colonel William R. Miles, commanding the infantry in the sector, had also removed all the rifles from the hospital that had been left by the sick and wounded. He was thus able to equip each of his soldiers with three weapons, greatly increasing their firepower. When the Union infantry closed within 200 yards they were met by a hail of rifle and canister fire, and few made it within 70 yards of the Confederate lines. Union commanders Sherman and Dow were wounded in these attacks, and Lieutenant Colonel James O&#x27;Brien, commanding the pioneer group, was killed. At 5 pm the commander of the 159th New York raised a white flag to signal a truce to remove the wounded and dead from the field. This ended the fighting for the day. None of the Union attacks had even made it to the Confederate parapets. The Union suffered 293 KIA, 1,545 wounded, 157 MIA, compared to the Confederate casualties of 235.

===The last infantry attack on the Port Hudson fortifications===
The successful defense of their lines brought a renewed confidence to Gardner and his garrison. They felt though a combination of well planned defensive earthworks and the skillful and deliberate reinforcement of threatened areas, the superior numbers of attackers had been repulsed. Learning from his experience, Gardner organized a more methodical system of defense. This involved dividing the fortifications into a network of defense zones, with an engineering officer in charge of strengthening the defense in each area. For the most part this involved once again charting the best cross fire for artillery positions, improving firepower concentrations, and digging protective pits to house artillery when not in use, to protect them from enemy bombardment.

Spent bullets and scrap metal were sewed into shirtsleeves to make up canister casings for the artillery, and the heavy coast guns facing the river that had center pivot mounts were cleared for firing on Union positions on the eastern side of the fortress. Three of these guns were equipped for this, and one columbiad in Battery Four was so effective in this that Union troops referred to it as the &quot;Demoralizer&quot;. Its fearful reputation spawned the myth that it was mounted on a railroad car, and could fire from any position in the fortifications. Captain L. J. Girard was placed in charge of the function of the artillery, and despite material shortages, achieved miracles in keeping the artillery functional. Rifles captured from the enemy or taken from hospitalized soldiers were stacked for use by troops in the trench lines.

Positions in front of the lines were land mined with unexploded 13-inch (330 mm) mortar shells, known as &quot;torpedoes&quot; at the time. Sniper positions were also prepared at high points in the trench works for sharpshooters. These methods improved the defense, but could not make up for the fact that the garrison was short of everything except gunpowder. The food shortage was a drag on morale, and resulted in a significant level of desertion to the enemy. This drain on manpower was recorded by Colonel Steedman, who wrote &quot;Our most serious and annoying difficulty is the unreliable character of a portion of our Louisiana troops. Many have deserted to the enemy, giving him information of our real condition; yet in the same regiments we have some of our ablest officers and men.&quot; Miles&#x27; Louisiana Legion were considered the greatest offenders.

On the Union side, astonishment and chagrin were near universal in reaction to the decisive defeat of the infantry assaults. Banks was determined to continue the siege as his political as well as military career would be destroyed by a withdrawal to Baton Rouge. The resources of his entire command were called into play, and men and material poured into the Union encirclement. Nine additional regiments appeared in the lines by June 1. 89 field guns were brought into action, and naval guns from USS &quot;Richmond&quot; were added to the siege guns bearing on the fortress. These six naval guns were 9-inch (229 mm) Dahlgren smoothbores. The guns were originally intended for a battery at the Head of Passes in the Mississippi Delta. The fact that four were finally emplaced in Battery Number 10, just east of &quot;Fort Desperate&quot; and two in Number 24, gives some idea of the reach and progress of the Union Navy. Each of the Dahlgren guns weighed 9,020 pounds and was 9 feet long, capable of firing a 73.5 pound (33.3 kg) exploding shell.

The second assault began with sustained shelling of the Confederate works, beginning at 11:15 am on 13 June 1863, and lasting an hour. Banks then sent a message to Gardner demanding the surrender of his position. Gardner replied &quot;My duty requires me to defend this position, and therefore I decline to surrender.&quot; Banks continued the bombardment for the night, but only gave the order for what was to be a simultaneous three-prong infantry attack at 1 am on 14 June. The attack finally began at 3:30 am, but the lack of any agreed upon plan and a heavy fog disordered the attack as it began. Grover&#x27;s column struck the Confederate line at &quot;Fort Desperate&quot; before the others, and the same formidable terrain combined with the enhanced Confederate defense stopped the attacks outside the rebel works. Auger&#x27;s demonstration at the center arrived after the main attack had failed, and the attack on the southern end of the line was made after daylight, and stood little chance as a result. The infantry attack had only resulted in even more dead and wounded soldiers: 1,792 Union casualties, against 47 Confederate. Division commander Brig. Gen. Halbert E. Paine led the main attack and fell wounded, losing a leg. After this, the actions against Port Hudson were reduced to bombardment and siege.

Shortly after the war, Capt. James F. Fitts of the 114th New York described the 14 June assault on in &quot;The Galaxy&quot; magazine:

===Last stages of the siege, June 15 to July 9, 1863===
The day after the last infantry assault, General Banks assembled some of his troops at the corps headquarters and thanked them for their previous efforts and sacrifices. He also asked for volunteers for a special attack group to be trained intensively to breach the Confederate trench line. His speech generated little enthusiasm, but a unit of 1036 men was formed and removed to a training camp in the rear to prepare for the attack. There they assembled siege ladders and organized into two battalions, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John B. Van Petten and Lieutenant Colonel A. S. Bickmore. Colonel Henry Warner Birge of the 13th Connecticut Infantry volunteered to lead the special assault regiment.

Regular siege operations were also reorganized under the command of a new chief engineer, Captain John C. Palfrey. He concentrated the efforts of the siege on three areas of the fortifications, Fort Desperate, the Priest Cap (Confederate batteries 14 &amp; 15), and the Citadel, the southernmost bastion of the fortifications, nicknamed by Union forces as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s Elbow&quot;. These efforts did not involve infantry rushing the trenches, but a siege technique called sapping, or constructing a series of zigzag trenches, fortified batteries, and sharpshooter positions intended to isolate and suppress individual defensive bastions. The sharpshooter or sniper positions were described at the time as &quot;trench cavaliers&quot; and were raised mounds of earth, reinforced with timbers or other materials to allow riflemen to overlook the enemy trenches and fire down into them.

The Citadel was to be reduced by a powerful siege battery constructed on a hill just to the south, Union battery number 24, intended to suppress the Confederate position by superior firepower. Union batteries were also constructed on the west bank of the Mississippi opposite Port Hudson, completely surrounding it with Union artillery batteries. Union forces also made raids on opposing trenches and batteries, to enhance their own trench lines or disable enemy batteries. Some of the 6th Michigan troops opposite the Citadel were armed with the .54 caliber (14 mm) breech-loading Merrill carbine, which gave them a rapid fire edge in trench raids. On June 26, a general bombardment from Union batteries and guns of the Union fleet began, disabling or suppressing what remained of the Confederate artillery. Along with the trenching operations, the Federals also constructed three mines underneath the opposing works, two of them directed against the Priest Cap, and one under the Citadel. After the mines were finished, chambers at the end of the mines would be loaded with powder, and exploded under the Confederate works, destroying them, and blowing gaps in the trench lines. At this point an infantry assault would be launched, hopefully overrunning the entire fortification.

The Confederates responded to the siege techniques with increased efforts of their own. The grist mill at Fort Desperate had been destroyed by shelling. It was replaced by using the locomotive from the defunct railroad to power millstones, providing a steady supply of cornmeal for the garrison. Expended rifle and artillery shells were salvaged for reuse by the defense, small arms shot being recast for making new cartridges, artillery rounds reused and distributed to Confederate artillery of the same caliber, or reused as mines and grenades. Additional trench lines, obstacles, mines, and bunkers were added to the threatened bastions, making them more difficult to bombard, infiltrate, or overrun. The Priest Cap bastion had a particularly elaborate defense system, including the use of telegraph wire staked up to a height of , in order to trip attacking infantry. Additional field artillery and infantry were added to the defense of Fort Desperate, making sapping in that area more costly.

Various raids against Union saps were also conducted. On June 26, the Confederates launched a trench raid by the 16th Arkansas Infantry against the Priest Cap sap, taking seven prisoners, and capturing weapons and supplies. Rebel trench raiders and defenders were adept at constructing and using improvised hand grenades. Raids by Logan&#x27;s cavalry were also made against Union positions outside the siege lines. On June 3 an advance by Grierson&#x27;s Union cavalry against Logan&#x27;s position at Clinton was repulsed. The 14th New York Cavalry was hit on June 15 near Newport, two miles from Port Hudson. Other raids struck Union foraging parties returning from Jackson, Louisiana, and captured the Union General Neal Dow, who was convalescing at Heath plantation. The biggest raid set fire to the Union supply center at Springfield Landing on July 2. These raids were annoying to Banks, but could not break the siege. On July 3, a countermine was exploded near one of the Federal mines under the Priests Cap. This collapsed the mine, but surprisingly did not cause any Union casualties. The defenders could not compensate for the constant losses of personnel resulting from starvation, disease, particularly scurvy, dysentery, and malaria, sniping, shell fragments, sunstroke and desertion. The use of mule meat and rats as rations could not maintain the health of the soldiers left standing, and was a further drain on morale.

The siege created hardships and deprivations for both the North and South, but by early July the Confederates were in much worse shape. They had exhausted practically all of their food supplies and ammunition, and fighting and disease had greatly reduced the number of men able to defend the trenches. When Maj. Gen. Gardner learned that Vicksburg had surrendered on July 4, 1863, he realized that his situation was hopeless and that nothing could be gained by continuing. The terms of surrender were negotiated, and on July 9, 1863, the Confederates laid down their weapons, ending 48 days of continuous fighting. It had been the longest siege in US military history.

Captain Thornton A. Jenkins accepted the Confederate surrender, as Admiral David Farragut was in New Orleans.

==Aftermath==

The surrender and that of Vicksburg gave the Union complete control of the Mississippi River and its major tributaries, severing communications and trade between the eastern and western states of the Confederacy.

Both sides had suffered heavy casualties: between 4,700 and 5,200 Union men were casualties, and an additional 4,000 fell prey to disease or sunstroke; Gardner&#x27;s forces suffered around 900 casualties, from battle losses and disease. Banks granted lenient terms to the Port Hudson garrison. The enlisted men were paroled to their homes, with transport for the sick and lightly wounded. Seriously sick or wounded were placed under Union medical care. 5,935 men and civilian employees of the Confederate Army were officially paroled. 405 officers were not paroled and were sent as prisoners to Memphis and New Orleans, half eventually winding up in Johnson&#x27;s Island prison camp in Ohio. Since the terms of the parole were not in agreement with parole conditions acceptable to the Union and Confederate armies then current, the Confederate Army furloughed the returned troops until September 15, 1863, then returned them to duty. This outraged some leaders of the Union army, but General Halleck, in charge of US armies, admitted the paroles were in error.

The reputation of black soldiers in Union service was enhanced by the siege. The advance of the Louisiana Guard on May 27 had gained much coverage in northern newspapers. The attack was repulsed, due to its hasty implementation, but was bravely carried out in spite of the hopeless magnitude of opposing conditions. This performance was noted by the army leadership. In a letter home, Captain Robert F. Wilkinson wrote, &quot;One thing I am glad to say, that is that the black troops at P. Hudson fought &amp; acted superbly. The theory of negro inefficiency is, I am very thankful at last thoroughly exploded by facts. We shall shortly have a splendid army of thousands of them.&quot; General Banks also noted their performance in his official report, stating, &quot;The severe test to which they were subjected, and the determined manner in which they encountered the enemy, leaves upon my mind no doubt of their ultimate success.&quot; These reports had an impact far from Louisiana, or the Union army. On June 11, 1863, an editorial from the influential and widely read &quot;New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;They were comparatively raw troops, and were yet subjected to the most awful ordeal... The men, white or black, who will not flinch from that, will flinch from nothing. It is no longer possible to doubt the bravery and steadiness of the colored race, when rightly led.&quot; These observations did much to support abolitionist efforts in the northeast to recruit free blacks for the Union armed services. By the end of the war nearly 200,000 blacks had served in the Union forces.

A significant result of the siege was the blow it gave Banks&#x27;s political ambitions. If Banks had overrun the position in May, he could then have taken command of Grant&#x27;s siege of Vicksburg as the ranking officer and appeared a hero. This would have redeemed his military reputation, and bolstered his political hopes for a presidential candidacy. Since Vicksburg fell before Port Hudson, Grant reaped the promotions and reputation for victory in the west, and eventually attained the White House, Banks&#x27;s cherished ambition. As it was, Banks had to settle for setting up cotton deals for his northeast constituency, and arrange political alliances for a new state government aligned with Union and Republican interests in mind. He was quite experienced in this kind of scheming, and in the absence of military opportunities, economic advantages beckoned. Banks&#x27;s armies had gathered $3 million worth of livestock and supplies while engaged in operations in western Louisiana in the spring of 1863. This bounty impressed Banks, and it was also estimated that vast stores of cotton and many Union sympathizers were waiting on the Red River in eastern Texas. In response to these observations, Banks produced his one third holding plan, the idea of re-opening trade with Europe, and diverting one third of the proceeds for the Federal Treasury. This economic bonanza would once again revive his political prospects, and justify the beginning of the Red River Campaign, a military expedition into eastern Texas, the next step in military operations in Louisiana.

After the war, a small number of former soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions at Port Hudson, including George Mason Lovering of the 4th Massachusetts, and future Wyoming Governor, Francis E. Warren of the 49th Massachusetts.

<text>Adrammelech (; &quot;Adramélekh&quot;) is an ancient Semitic god mentioned briefly by name in the Book of Kings, where he is described as a god of &quot;Sepharvaim&quot;. Sepharvaim (a word which is grammatically dual) is commonly, but not certainly, identified with the twin cities of Sippar Yahrurum and Sippar Amnanum on the banks of the Euphrates, north of Babylon. The name Adrammelech probably translates to &quot;Magnificent king.&quot;

==Historical background==
===Biblical account===

 reports: &quot;The Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim&quot; (NIV). The Sepharvites are given as a people deported by the Assyrians to Samaria. Adrammelech and the god Anammelech (about whom likewise little is known) are again seemingly alluded to in : &quot;Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?&quot; (NIV). has an almost identical passage.

===Interpretation===

According to A. R. Millard, Saul Olyan, and others, &quot;Adrammelech&quot; likely represents an original &quot;ʾAddîr-meleḵ&quot;, &quot;majestic king&quot; or &quot;the majestic one is king&quot;. Cognate &quot;ʾAddîr-milk&quot;, along with similar &quot;Milk-ʾaddîr&quot; (with the morphemes inverted) and &quot;Baʿal-ʾaddîr&quot; (&quot;majestic master&quot; or &quot;majestic Baal&quot;), is recorded in ancient Semitic sources as an epithet of Baal, or a baal.

Adrammelech is commonly understood as a companion of Anammelech, due to their association in 2 Kings 17, the similarity of their names, and the similarity of their worship through child sacrifice.

Before the identification with epigraphic &quot;ʾAddîr-milk&quot;, various attempts (since generally rejected) were made to interpret the origin of the name &quot;Adrammelech&quot;.

The reconstructed form &quot;*Adar-malik&quot; (or the variant &quot;*Adru-malku&quot;) was once almost universally accepted as the original Akkadian form of the name. For example, Eberhard Schrader wrote in 1885:

Peter Jensen proposed in the late nineteenth century that (&quot;ʾAḏrammeleḵ&quot;, &quot;Adrammelech&quot;) was a manuscript error for (&quot;*ʾĂḏaḏmeleḵ&quot;, &quot;*Adadmelech&quot;), due to the typographical similarity of (&quot;r&quot;) and (&quot;d&quot;), which Jensen thought was a variant of unrecorded (&quot;*Ḥăḏaḏmeleḵ&quot;, &quot;King Hadad&quot; or &quot;Hadad is king&quot;), thus identifying Adrammelech with the Canaanite god Hadad. &quot;Adad&quot; is in fact recorded as a variant of &quot;Hadad&quot;; but Millard writes: &quot;If the Sepharvites were of Aramean or Phoenician origin, it is very unlikely that the name of their god would have lost its initial &quot;h&quot;, unless the Hebrew authors of Kings copied the information from a cuneiform text in Babylonian, which would not express it.&quot;

At the turn of the century, William Muss-Arnolt suggested that &quot;ʾAḏrammeleḵ&quot; could represent his own reconstructed Akkadian &quot;*Atra-malik&quot;, comparing the form to the names &quot;Atra-ḫasis&quot; and &quot;*(A)tar-ilu&quot;, writing, &quot;&quot;Atra-malik&quot; would probably yield .&quot;

==In the Talmud==

From the Jewish Encyclopedia:

==Demonology==
Like many pagan gods, Adrammelech is considered a demon in some Judeo-Christian traditions. So he appears in Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, where he is a fallen angel who, along with Asmodeus, is vanquished by Uriel and Raphael. According to Collin de Plancy&#x27;s book on demonology, &quot;Infernal Dictionary&quot;, Adrammelech became the President of the Senate of the demons. He is also the Chancellor of Hell and supervisor of Satan&#x27;s wardrobe. He is generally depicted with a human torso, a mule&#x27;s head, a peacock tail, and the limbs of a mule or peacock.
In the Ars Goetia, he was known as Andrealphus.

==In fiction==
A poet&#x27;s description of Adrammelech (spelled &quot;Adramelech&quot; as in Greek) can be found in Robert Silverberg&#x27;s short story &quot;Basileus&quot;. He is described as &quot;The enemy of God, greater in ambition, guile and mischief than Satan. A fiend more curst—a deeper hypocrite.&quot;

An attempt to summon Adrammelech (spelled &quot;Adramelech&quot; throughout) is central to the plot of Graham Masterton&#x27;s 1978 horror novel &quot;The Devils of D Day&quot;. 

He appears as an enemy in the video game &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;, being the first boss of said video game and is fought again later on.

<doc id="261998" wikidata="Q816170" url="?curid=261998" title="Belphegor">
<text>Belphegor (or Baal Peor, Hebrew: בַּעַל-פְּעוֹר baʿal-pəʿōr – “&quot;Lord of the Gap&quot;”) is, in Christianity, a demon associated with one of the seven deadly sins. According to religious tradition, he helps people make discoveries. He seduces people by proposing incredible inventions that will make them rich. According to some demonologists from the 17th century, his powers are strongest in April. The German bishop and witch hunter, Peter Binsfeld (ca. 1540–ca.1600), wrote that Belphegor tempts through laziness. According to Binsfeld&#x27;s &quot;Classification of Demons&quot;, Belphegor is the main demon of the deadly sin known as sloth in the Christian tradition. The anonymous author of the Lollard tract &quot;The Lanterne of Light&quot;, however, believed Belphegor to embody the sin of gluttony rather than sloth.

Belphegor derives from the Assyrian Baal-Peor, a Baal worshipped at Mount Peor, to whom the Israelites were associated in Shittim (Numbers 25:3) and who was associated with intemperance and orgies. It was worshiped in the form of a phallus. As a demon, he is described in Kabbalistic writings as &quot;the one who quarrels&quot;, an enemy of the sixth Sefirot &quot;beauty&quot;. In stories where he was invoked, he bestows wealth, power to make discoveries and make fantastic inventions. His role as a demon was to sow dispute between people, and to lead them to evil through the distribution of wealth.

The palindrome prime number 1000000000000066600000000000001 is known as Belphegor&#x27;s prime, due to the superstitious significance of the numbers it contains. Belphegor&#x27;s prime number consists of the number 666, surrounded on both sides by thirteen zeros and finally one one.

According to De Plancy&#x27;s Dictionnaire Infernal, Belphegor was Hell&#x27;s ambassador to France. As a result, his enemy is St Mary Magdalene, one of the patron saints of France.

==Literature==

The novella by Italian diplomat Niccolò Machiavelli was first published in 1549, and regales how the demon comes to earth to find a mate.

Belphegor figures in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; by John Milton, 1667.
According to the 1818 by Collin de Plancy, Belphegor was Hell&#x27;s ambassador to France. The same claim was repeated by Victor Hugo in &quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot; (1866).

In the grimoire &quot;Key of Solomon&quot; (translated into English by S.L. Mathers in 1889), Belphegor is listed near the end of the book as an Assyrian idol, now destroyed.

The novella by Machiavelli became the basis for the opera &quot;Belfagor&quot; by Ottorino Respighi, which premiered at La Scala in Milan in 1923.

<doc id="262002" wikidata="Q508283" url="?curid=262002" title="Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party">
<text>The Secretariat, officially the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, is a body serving the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#x27;s Politburo and Standing Committee. The secretariat is mainly responsible for carrying out routine operations of the Politburo and coordinating organizations and stakeholders to achieve tasks set out by the Politburo. It is empowered by the Politburo to make routine day-to-day decisions on issues of concern in accordance with the decisions of the Politburo, but it must consult the Politburo on substantive matters.

The secretariat was established in January 1934. It is nominally headed by the CCP general secretary, though the position of head of the secretariat was not always the same as the top party leader. Secretaries of the secretariat (&quot;Shujichu Shuji&quot;) are considered some of the most important political positions in the CCP and contemporary China, more generally. Each secretariat secretary is generally in charge of one of the major party departments directly under the jurisdiction of the Central Committee. By protocol, its members are ranked above the vice chairmen of the National People&#x27;s Congress as well as State Councilors. The general secretary presides over the secretariat&#x27;s work.

== History ==
The Secretariat of the Central Committee was formed on 15–18 January 1934 at the 5th Plenary Session of the 6th Central Committee, which was held in Shanghai. On 20 March 1943, the Politburo, in a joint decision, decreed that the secretariat will be responsible for carrying out the work of the Politburo according to the general policy framework determined by the Politburo and that it is vested with the power to make decisions within this general framework.

A formal head of the secretariat for managing its affairs has existed several times. Ren Bishi was elected Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party by the 6th Poliburo in August 1941. It existed until a meeting of the 7th Politburo on 20 March 1943, which abolished the post and replaced it with the new office of Chairman of the Secretariat, with Mao Zedong being elected to the post. The 1st Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee elected Ren Bishi as Secretary-General of the Central Committee and Li Fuchun as Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee on 11 June 1945. It is unclear who took over Ren Bishi&#x27;s office upon his death on 27 October 1950.

On 27 April 1954, the 8th Politburo decided to establish the offices of Secretary-General of the Central Committee and Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee. Deng Xiaoping was elected as secretary-general and Li Fuchun, Yang Shangkun, Tan Zhenlin, Ma Mingfang, Song Renqiong, Liu Lantao, Lin Feng, Li Xuefeng and Hu Qiaomu as deputy secretaries-general. This institution was not called Secretariat, but rather the &quot;Conference of the Secretary-General&quot;. The 8th National Congress in 1956 abolished it and formally replaced it with the Secretariat. The 1st Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee opted to re-elect Deng Xiaoping as secretary-general with no deputy on 28 September 1956.

In May 1966, the 8th Politburo convened to criticize the mistakes of leading cadres, including that of Deng Xiaoping. He was replaced, and the office of the secretary-general was abolished, and Tao Zhu was elected as Standing Secretary. It is unclear when this office stopped functioning, and the Secretariat more generally, but the 9th National Congress in 1969 decided to abolish these institutions.

The office was re-established in 1978 when Chen Yun, a member of the 11th Politburo Standing Committee, proposed to the 11th Politburo to re-establish both the Secretariat and the offices of secretary-general and deputy secretary-general. That politburo meeting re-established elected Hu Yaobang as secretary-general and Hu Qiaomu and Yao Yilin as deputy secretaries-general, but did not re-establish the Secretariat. This occurred at the 5th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee on 23–29 February 1980, but this plenum also decided to abolish the offices of deputy secretary-general. The position was abolished alongside the office of Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party at the 12th National Congress in 1982, and replaced with the office of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

== Functions ==
The Secretariat is the working body of the CCP Politburo and Politburo Standing Committee. The CCP General Secretary presides over the work of the Secretariat. The members of the Secretariat are nominated by the Politburo Standing Committee and approved during a plenary session of the CCP Central Committee. The secretaries of the Secretariat are tasked with coordinating the dissemination and implementation of Politburo and PSC decisions. They also assist in reviewing political reports, creating policy plans and help in personnel decisions.

== First secretary ==
The first secretary is the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Secretariat, who is responsible for the management of directives and day-to-day work of the Secretariat assisting the general secretary. A member of both the Politburo Standing Committee and the Secretariat, the officeholder is considered one of the most powerful figures in China&#x27;s political system.

The two most recent general secretaries, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, were first elevated to the position of first secretary of the Secretariat in the same process used to determine the membership and roles of the Politburo Standing Committee.

<doc id="262003" wikidata="Q719711" url="?curid=262003" title="Johann Weyer">
<text>Johannes Wier ( or &quot;&quot;; 1515 – 24 February 1588) was a Dutch physician who was among the first to publish a thorough treatise against the trials and persecution of people accused of witchcraft. His most influential work is (&#x27;On the Illusions of the Demons and on Spells and Poisons&#x27;; 1563).

==Biography==
Weyer was born in Grave, a small town in the Duchy of Brabant in the Habsburg Netherlands. He attended the Latin schools in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch and Leuven and when he was about 14 years of age, he became a live-in student of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, in Antwerp. Agrippa had to leave Antwerp in 1532 and he and Weyer settled in Bonn, under the protection of prince-bishop Hermann von Wied (Agrippa completed a work on demons in 1533 and perished two years later while on a trip to France). From 1534, Weyer studied medicine in Paris and later in Orléans, but it appears unlikely that he obtained the title of Doctor through these studies. 

Eventually, he practiced as a physician in his native Grave. Weyer was appointed city physician of Arnhem in 1545. In this capacity, he was asked for advice on witchcraft in a 1548 court case involving a fortune teller. In spite of a subsidy from emperor Charles V, the town of Arnhem was no longer able to pay Weyer&#x27;s salary. Weyer moved to Cleves in 1550, where he became court doctor to duke William the Rich, through mediation by humanist Konrad Heresbach. Weyer published his major works on witchcraft in which he applied a skeptical medical view to reported wonders and supposed examples of witchcraft. He retired from his post in 1578 and was succeeded by his son, Galenus Wier (1547-1619). After retirement he completed a medical work on a subject unrelated to witchcraft. He died on 24 February 1588 at the age of 73 in Tecklenburg, while visiting an individual who had fallen ill. He was buried in the local churchyard, which no longer exists.

==Work and critical reception==
Weyer&#x27;s works include medical and moral works as well as his more famous critiques of magic and witchcraft:
* (&#x27;On the Illusions of the Demons and on Spells and Poisons&#x27;), 1563.
** (&#x27;The False Kingdom of the Demons&#x27;), an appendix to , 1577.
* , 1567, translated into German as:
** , 1580, (&#x27;A book of medical observations on rare, hitherto undescribed diseases&#x27;)
* 1577, (A book on witches together with a treatise on false fasting), translated into German as:
** ... 1586
* 1577, (&#x27;On the disease of anger&#x27;), translated into German as:
** 1585
* , 1564 (&#x27;On scurvy&#x27;)
* , 1579. 1885 translation printed , Paris France. Two volume set.

Weyer criticised the and the witch hunting by the Christian and Civil authorities; he is said to have been the first person that used the term &quot;mentally ill&quot; or &quot;melancholy&quot; to designate those women accused of practicing witchcraft. In a time when witch trials and executions were just beginning to be common, he sought to derogate the law concerning witchcraft prosecution. He claimed that not only were examples of magic largely incredible but that the crime of witchcraft was literally impossible, so that anyone who confessed to the crime was likely to be suffering some mental disturbance (mainly melancholy, a very flexible category with many different symptoms).

Some scholars have said that Weyer intended to mock the concept of the hellish hierarchy that previous grimoires had established by writing those two books and entitling his catalogue of demons (&#x27;The False Kingdom of the Demons&#x27;).

Nevertheless, while he defended the idea that the Devil&#x27;s power was not as strong as claimed by the orthodox Christian churches in , he defended also the idea that demons did have power and could appear before people who called upon them, creating illusions; but he commonly referred to magicians and not to witches when speaking about people who could create illusions, saying they were heretics who were using the Devil&#x27;s power to do it, and when speaking on witches, he used the term &quot;mentally ill&quot;.

Moreover, Weyer did not only write the catalogue of demons , but also gave their description and the conjurations to invoke them in the appropriate hour and in the name of God and the Trinity, not to create illusions but to oblige them to do the conjurer&#x27;s will, as well as advice on how to avoid certain perils and tricks if the demon was reluctant to do what he was commanded or a liar. In addition, he wanted to abolish the prosecution of witches, and when speaking on those who invoke demons (which he called &quot;spirits&quot;) he carefully used the word &quot;exorcist&quot;.

Weyer never denied the existence of the Devil and a huge number of other demons of high and low order. His work was an inspiration for other occultists and demonologists, including an anonymous author who wrote the (The Lesser Key of Solomon). There were many editions of his books (written in Latin), especially , and several adaptations in English, including Reginald Scot&#x27;s &quot;Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot; (1584).

Weyer&#x27;s appeal for clemency for those accused of the crime of witchcraft was opposed later in the sixteenth century by the Swiss physician Thomas Erastus, the French legal theorist Jean Bodin and King James VI of Scotland.

== Tributes ==
The church of Tecklenburg displays a plaque in memory of Weyer and in 1884 the town erected a tower in his honor, the . The Dutch human rights organization for health workers is named the Johannes Wier Foundation after him. Alongside his tutor, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, he appears as a character in the video game &quot;&quot;.

Kurt Baschwitz, a pioneer in communication studies and mass psychology, dedicated most of the content of his first Dutch monography on witchcraft and witch trials (1948) to the merits of Weyer. Later he extended this work to his German magnum opus, which discussed methods of fighting attempts at mass delusion (1963).

==Family==
Johan was the son of Agnes Rhordam and Theodorus (Dirk) Wier, a merchant of hops, coal and slate, who was a of Grave in the 1520s. Dirk and Agnes Wier came from Zeeland and were closely acquainted with Maximiliaan van Egmond and Françoise de Lannoy, the future in-laws of William the Silent. Johan had two known siblings, Arnold Wier and the mystic Mathijs Wier (c.1520–c.1560). In Arnhem, he married Judith Wintgens, with whom he had at least five children. After Judith&#x27;s death he married Henriette Holst. Johan&#x27;s oldest son, Diederik Wier, became a jurist and diplomat, who in 1566-7, while employed by Willem IV van den Bergh, was involved in the &quot;petitions of grievances about the suppression of heresy&quot; by the Dutch nobility to Philip II of Spain, the rejection of which led to the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

==Name==
Weyer signed all his correspondence with &quot;Johannes Wier&quot; or occasionally with &quot;Piscinarius&quot;. His parents and children carried the name &quot;Wier&quot; as well, and in 1884 his memorial in Germany was still named &quot; rather than &quot;. Nevertheless, since the 20th century the name &quot;Johann Weyer&quot; has become standard in German and English-language scholarship. The use of &quot;Weyer&quot; may stem from Carl Binz&#x27;s 1896 monograph &quot;, who in 1885 had already given a lecture &quot;, in which he, apparently unaware of Weyer&#x27;s Zeeland origin, claimed that and &quot;Wier&quot; was merely a dialect pronunciation of Weyer.

James Hackett built her at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and she was launched on 15 August 1799. She was one of the original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized. The name &quot;Congress&quot; was among ten names submitted to President George Washington by Secretary of War Timothy Pickering in March 1795 for the frigates that were to be constructed.Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy&#x27;s capital ships, and so &quot;Congress&quot; and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than the standard frigates of the period.

Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the Quasi War with France and to defeat the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War. During the War of 1812 she made several extended length cruises in company with her sister ship and captured, or assisted in the capture of twenty British merchant ships. At the end of 1813, due to a lack of materials to repair her, she was placed in ordinary for the remainder of the war. In 1815 she returned to service for the Second Barbary War and made patrols through 1816. In the 1820s she helped suppress piracy in the West Indies, made several voyages to South America, and was the first U.S. warship to visit China. &quot;Congress&quot; spent her last ten years of service as a receiving ship until ordered broken up in 1834.

==Construction==
In 1785 Barbary pirates, most notably from Algiers, began to seize American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794. The act provided funds to construct six frigates, but included a clause that if peace terms were agreed to with Algiers, the construction of the ships would be halted.

Joshua Humphreys&#x27; design was unusual for the time, involving a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys&#x27; design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states in the size of their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a ship of the line. However, Congress was a scaled-down version of his more famous designs for Constitution, United States and President, being closer in size to the standard European frigates of the day, and mounting the usual armament of 18-pounder guns.

&quot;Congress&quot; was given her name by President George Washington after a principle of the United States Constitution. Her keel was laid down by 12 December 1795 at a shipyard in Kittery, Maine (then a district of Massachusetts). James Hackett was charged with her construction and Captain James Sever served as a superintendent. Her construction proceeded slowly and was completely suspended when in March 1796, a peace treaty was signed with Algiers. &quot;Congress&quot; remained at the shipyard, incomplete, until relations with France deteriorated in 1798 with the start of the Quasi-War. At the request of then President John Adams, funds were approved on 16 July to complete her construction.

===Armament===


The Naval Act of 1794 had specified 36-gun frigates. However, &quot;Congress&quot; and her sister-ship were re-rated to 38s because of their large dimensions, being in length and in width.

The &quot;ratings&quot; by number of guns were meant only as an approximation, and &quot;Congress&quot; often carried up to 48 guns. Ships of this era had no permanent battery of guns such as modern Navy ships carry. The guns and cannons were designed to be completely portable and often were exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer outfitted armaments to their liking, taking into consideration factors such as the overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, the armaments on ships would change often during their careers, and records of the changes were not generally kept.

During her first cruise in the Quasi-War against France, &quot;Congress&quot; was noted to be armed with a battery of forty guns consisting of twenty-eight and twelve . For her patrols during the War of 1812, she was armed with a battery of forty-four guns consisting of twenty-four 18 pounders and twenty .

==Quasi-War==
&quot;Congress&quot; launched on 15 August 1799 under the command of Captain Sever. After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set off on her maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with &quot;Essex&quot; to escort merchant ships to the East Indies. Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures. Without the full support of the rigging, all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing the ship&#x27;s Forth Lieutenant trying to repair the main mast. She was away from the convoy at the time, &quot;Essex&quot; had lost sight of her, probably because of the dismasting, and was located at () at the time.

The crew rigged an emergency sail, accomplished by 22 January, and limped back to the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs, arriving off Hampton Roads on 24 February. While there, some of Sever&#x27;s junior officers announced that they had no confidence in his ability as a commanding officer. A Court of Inquiry was held on 26 April 1800 on board , and Captain Sever was cleared of any wrongdoing and remained in command of &quot;Congress&quot;, though many of his crew soon transferred out to . Remaining in port for six months while her masts and rigging were repaired, she finally sailed again on 26 July for the West Indies. &quot;Congress&quot; made routine patrols escorting American merchant ships and seeking out French ships to capture. On two occasions she almost ran aground; first while pursuing a French privateer, she ran into shallow water where large rocks were seen near the surface. Although their exact depth was not determined, Sever immediately abandoned pursuit of the privateer and changed course towards deeper waters. Her second close call occurred off the coast of the Caicos Islands, when during the night she drifted close to the reefs. At daybreak her predicament was discovered by the lookouts. On 29 August 1800, she recaptured the American merchant brig &quot;Experiment&quot; captured by privateer &quot;Bayonnnese&quot; on 26 August. On 2 October she spotted HMS Ticiphone with a brig following her, her prize under tow. Capt. Sever decided to cut between the two ships and didn&#x27;t notice there was a towline running between them until it was too late to avoid an accident. Sever sent an immediate letter of apology to Capt. John Davie.

A peace treaty with France was ratified on 3 February 1801 and &quot;Congress&quot; returned to Boston by 3 April. In accordance with an act of Congress passed on 3 March and signed by President John Adams, thirteen frigates then currently in service were to be retained. Seven of those frigates, including &quot;Congress&quot;, were to be placed in ordinary. En route to the Washington Navy Yard, she passed Mount Vernon on her way up the Potomac and Captain Sever ordered her sails lowered, flag at half mast, and a 13-gun salute fired to honor the recently deceased George Washington. &quot;Congress&quot; decommissioned at Washington along with and .

==First Barbary War==
During the United States&#x27; preoccupation with France during the Quasi-War, troubles with the Barbary States were suppressed by the payment of tribute to ensure that American merchant ships were not harassed and seized. In 1801 Yusuf Karamanli of Tripoli, dissatisfied with the amount of tribute he was receiving in comparison to Algiers, demanded an immediate payment of $250,000. In response, Thomas Jefferson sent a squadron of frigates to protect American merchant ships in the Mediterranean and pursue peace with the Barbary States.

The first squadron, under the command of Richard Dale in , was instructed to escort merchant ships through the Mediterranean and negotiate with leaders of the Barbary States. A second squadron was assembled under the command of Richard Valentine Morris in however, the performance of Morris&#x27;s squadron was so poor that he was recalled and subsequently dismissed from the Navy in 1803. A third squadron was assembled under the command of Edward Preble in and by mid-1804 they had successfully fought the Battle of Tripoli Harbor.

On 21 March, 1804 The Secretary of the Navy ordered Lt. Cassin, supervisor of the Washington Navy Yard, to prepare her for sea.
President Jefferson reinforced Preble&#x27;s squadron in April and ordered four frigates to sail as soon as possible. &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot;, &quot;Constellation&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; were placed under the direction of Commodore Samuel Barron. &quot;Congress&quot; was captained by John Rodgers and two months were spent preparing the squadron for the voyage. She sailed from Alexandria, Virginia on 28 May, 1804. She arrived at Hampton Roads on 8 May. They departed in late June and arrived at Gibraltar on 12 August. &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;Essex&quot; were immediately sent to patrol off the coast of Tangier and when they returned to Gibraltar two weeks later, &quot;Congress&quot; continued on to Tripoli.

&quot;Congress&quot;, accompanied by &quot;Constellation&quot;, assumed blockade duties of Tripoli and captured one &quot;xebec&quot; before sailing for Malta on 25 October for repairs. On 6 November Rodgers assumed command of &quot;Constitution&quot; and in his place, Stephen Decatur assumed command of &quot;Congress&quot;. The next recorded activity of &quot;Congress&quot; is in early July 1805 when she was sent in company with to blockade Tunisia. They were joined on the 23rd by additional U.S. Navy vessels. In early September, &quot;Congress&quot; carried the Tunisian ambassador back to Washington DC. Afterward, placed in ordinary at the Washington Navy Yard, she served as a classroom for midshipmen training through 1807.

==War of 1812==


In 1811 &quot;Congress&quot; required extensive repairs before recommissioning with Captain John Rogers in command. She performed routine patrols early in 1812 before war was declared on 18 June. Captain John Smith assumed the command of her on 11 July 1812 and took her to join the squadron of Commodore Rodgers, where she sailed in company with , , &quot;President&quot; and .

Almost immediately Rogers was informed by a passing American merchant ship of a fleet of British merchantmen en route to Britain from Jamaica. &quot;Congress&quot; sailed along in pursuit, but was interrupted when &quot;President&quot; began pursuing HMS &quot;Belvidera&quot; on 23 June. &quot;Congress&quot; trailed behind &quot;President&quot; during the chase and fired her bowchasers at the escaping &quot;Belvidera&quot;. Unable to capture &quot;Belvidera&quot;, the squadron returned to the pursuit of the Jamaican fleet. On 1 July they began to follow a trail of coconut shells and orange peels the Jamaican fleet had left behind them. Sailing to within one day&#x27;s journey of the English Channel, the squadron never sighted the convoy and Rodgers called off the pursuit on the 13th. During their return trip to Boston, &quot;Congress&quot; assisted in the capture of seven merchant ships, including the recapture of an American vessel.

Making her second cruise against the British with &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Congress&quot; sailed from Boston on 8 October. On the 31st of that month, both ships began to pursue , which was escorting two merchant ships. &quot;Galatea&quot; and her charges were chased for about three hours, during which &quot;Congress&quot; captured the merchant ship &quot;Argo&quot;. In the meantime, &quot;President&quot; kept after &quot;Galatea&quot; but lost sight of her as darkness fell. &quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;President&quot; remained together during November but they did not find a single ship to capture. On their return to the United States they passed north of Bermuda, proceeded towards the Virginia capes, and arrived back in Boston on 31 December. During their entire time at sea, the two frigates captured nine prizes.

&quot;Congress&quot; and &quot;President&quot; were blockaded in Boston by the Royal Navy until they slipped through the blockade on 30 April 1813 and put to sea for their third cruise of the war. On 2 May they pursued but she outran them both and escaped. &quot;Congress&quot; parted company with &quot;President&quot; on the 8th and patrolled off the Cape Verde Islands and the coast of Brazil. She only captured four small British merchant ships during this period and returned to the Portsmouth Navy Yard for repairs in late 1813. By this time of the war, materials and personnel were being diverted to the Great Lakes, which created a shortage of resources necessary to repair her. Due to the amount of repairs she needed, it was decided instead to place her in ordinary, where she stayed for the remainder of the war.

Louis F. Middlebrook in Vol. LXIII, October 1927 of Essex Institute Historical Collections listing following prizes taken by her under the command of Captain John Smith:November 1, 1812, off Western Islands, the British whaler , 10 guns and 26 men, with a cargo of oil and whalebone, bound for London, and ordered to the United States.May 19, 1813, in Lat. 28 N., Long. 42 W., the British brig &quot;Jean&quot;, 10 guns and 17 men, with a cargo of copper, hides, etc., bound to Greenock. After taking out the copper, the brig was burned.May 22, 1813, in Lat. 24 N., Long. 40 W., the British brig &quot;Diana&quot;, 10 guns and 14 men, with a cargo of copper and hides bound to London, and sent into Barbadoes with the prisoners, after throwing overboard her cargo.October 25, 1813, in Lat. 19 N., Long. 40 W., the British ship &quot;Rose&quot;, of 182 tons, crew of 12 men, with a cargo of wine and potatoes. Burned. All of her crew voluntarily enlisted in the service of the United States.December 5, 1813, in the North Atlantic, the British brig &quot;Atlantic&quot;, crew of 12 men and a cargo of sugar and cotton from the West Indies to Cork. This brig was sent into Boston.

==Second Barbary War==
Soon after the United States declared war against Britain in 1812, Algiers took advantage of the United States&#x27; preoccupation with Britain and began intercepting American merchant ships in the Mediterranean. On 2 March 1815, at the request of President James Madison, Congress declared war on Algiers. Work preparing two American squadrons promptly began—one at Boston under Commodore William Bainbridge, and one at New York under Commodore Steven Decatur.

Captain Charles Morris assumed command of &quot;Congress&quot; and assigned to the squadron under Bainbridge. After repairs and refitting, she transported the Minister to Holland William Eustis to his new post. &quot;Congress&quot; departed in June and after a few weeks at Holland, sailed for the Mediterranean and arrived at Cartagena, Spain in early August joining Bainbridge&#x27;s squadron. By the time of &quot;Congress&quot;″s arrival, however, Commodore Decatur had already secured a peace treaty with Algiers.

&quot;Congress&quot;, , and sailed in company with Bainbridge&#x27;s flagship —the first commissioned ship of the line of the U.S. Navy—as a show of force off Algiers. The squadron subsequently made appearances off Tripoli and Tunis and arrived at Gibraltar in early October. From there, &quot;Congress&quot; and many other ships were ordered back to the United States. She arrived at Newport, Rhode Island, remained there shortly, and proceeded to Boston where she decommissioned in December and assigned to ordinary.

==Later career==

In June 1816 Charles Morris again commanded &quot;Congress&quot; and began preparations for a cruise to the Pacific Coast of the United States. His objective was taking possession of Fort Astoria from the British and conducting inquiries at various ports along the coast to further improve commercial trade. These plans were canceled, however, when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a Spanish Navy vessel in the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, Morris commanded a squadron of ships in the Gulf to ensure that American merchant commerce in the area would continue unmolested.

&quot;Congress&quot; arrived in the Gulf of Mexico in December 1816 and made patrols through July 1817 performing duties that Morris described as &quot;tedious and uninteresting&quot;. From there she sailed for Haiti where Morris and an agent of the United States negotiated a settlement with Henri Christophe over the case of a captured vessel. Afterward, &quot;Congress&quot; sailed for Venezuela to observe and gather information regarding the ongoing Venezuelan War of Independence. She arrived about 21 August and visited the Venezuelan city of Barcelona soon after.

Upon return to the Norfolk Navy Yard later the same year, Morris requested relief as commander due to failing health and Arthur Sinclair assumed command. Sinclair began preparing for a return voyage to South America carrying a diplomatic contingent to assure various South American countries of the United States&#x27; intention to remain neutral in their conflicts with Spain for independence. The diplomats included Caesar A. Rodney, John Graham, Theodorick Bland, Henry Brackenridge, William Reed, and Thomas Rodney. &quot;Congress&quot; departed on 4 December and returned to Norfolk in July 1818.

Early in 1819 &quot;Congress&quot; made a voyage under the command of Captain John D. Henley to China, becoming the first U.S. warship to visit that country. She returned to the United States in May 1821. Shortly afterward, pirates in the West Indies began seizing American merchant ships and in early 1822, she served as the flagship of Commodore James Biddle. She is recorded as collecting prisoners from the captured pirate ship &quot;Bandara D&#x27;Sangare&quot; on 24 July of that year. Her next recorded activity is returning to Norfolk in April 1823 where Biddle immediately prepared for a voyage to Spain and Argentina to deliver the newly appointed Ministers, Hugh Nelson and Caesar A. Rodney respectively.

Extensive modifications were required to the berth deck of &quot;Congress&quot; in order to accommodate Rodney&#x27;s wife and eleven children. Additionally, Rodney&#x27;s household goods and furniture, described by Biddle as &quot;enough to fill a large merchant ship,&quot; were loaded into her hold that required much of the ships stores to be relocated. She departed from Wilmington, Delaware, on 8 June and arrived at Gibraltar where Hugh Nelson disembarked for Spain. On 18 September &quot;Congress&quot; arrived at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where Rodney hired his own merchant ship to carry his family the rest of the distance to Buenos Aires. &quot;Congress&quot; subsequently returned to Norfolk on 17 December.

After her return, &quot;Congress&quot; served as a receiving ship; being moved between the Norfolk and Washington Navy Yards under tow as needed. She remained on this duty for the next ten years until a survey of her condition was performed in 1834, and found unfit for repair, she was broken up the same year.

<text>Panay Gulf is an extension of the Sulu Sea, reaching between the islands of Panay and Negros in the Philippines. The gulf contains the island-province of Guimaras and extends into the Iloilo Strait, between Panay and Guimaras, and into Guimaras Strait, between Guimaras and Negros. Guimaras Strait connects Panay Gulf with the Visayan Sea.

The Port of Iloilo is the busiest port on the gulf, which is a major route used by ships plying the areas between Iloilo City, Bacolod, and Zamboanga further to the south.

The Panay Landing during World War II occurred in Panay Gulf.

<text>Peter Binsfeld (alternate spelling Peter of Binsfeld, lat. Petrus Binsfeldius; c. 1540 – 1598 or 1603) was a German auxiliary bishop and theologian.

Peter, a son of a farmer and craftsman, was born in the village of Binsfeld in the rural Eifel region, located in the modern state of Rhineland-Palatinate; he died in Trier as a victim of the bubonic plague. Binsfeld grew up in the predominantly Catholic environment of the Eifel region.

==Education and career==
Considered by a local abbot to be a very gifted boy, Peter Binsfeld was sent to Rome for study.

After his studies, Binsfeld returned to his home region and became an important personality in the anti-Protestant Catholic activities of the late 16th century. He was elected Auxiliary bishop of Trier and became a well-known writer on theology, who achieved notoriety as one of the most prominent witch-hunters of his time. Binsfeld was one of the main drivers of the Trier witch trials that ravaged the area under the dominion of Archbishop Johann von Schönenberg between 1581-93. Binsfeld wrote the influential treatise &quot;De confessionibus maleficorum et sagarum&quot; (&#x27;Of the Confessions of Warlocks and Witches&#x27;), translated into several languages (Trier, 1589). This work discussed the confessions of alleged witches, and claimed that even if such confessions were produced by torture, they should still be believed. He also encouraged denouncements.

He thought that girls under age twelve and boys under age fourteen could not be considered guilty of practising witchcraft, but due to the precocity of some children the law should not be completely strict. This point of view can be considered as moderate, taking into account that some tribunals had condemned children between two and five years of age to be burnt at the stake.

Contrary to other authors of the time, Binsfeld doubted the ability of shapeshifting and the validity of the diabolical mark.

In 1589, Binsfield published an influential list of demons and their associated sins, including the demons associated with the Seven Deadly Sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (greed), Asmodeus (lust), Leviathan (envy), Beelzebub (gluttony), Satan (wrath) and Belphegor (sloth).

<text>The oilbird (Steatornis caripensis), locally known as the &#x27;, is a bird species found in the northern areas of South America including the Caribbean island of Trinidad. It is the only living species in the genus Steatornis&quot;&quot;&#x27;, the family Steatornithidae, and the order Steatornithiformes. Nesting in colonies in caves, oilbirds are nocturnal feeders on the fruits of the oil palm and tropical laurels. They are the only nocturnal flying fruit-eating birds in the world (the kākāpō, also nocturnal, is flightless). They forage at night, with specially adapted eyesight. However, they navigate by echolocation in the same way as bats, one of the few birds to do so. They produce a high-pitched clicking sound of around 2 kHz that is audible to humans.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
Oilbirds are related to the nightjars and have sometimes been placed with these in the order Caprimulgiformes. However, the nightjars and their relatives are insectivores while the oilbird is a specialist fructivore, and it is sufficiently distinctive to be placed in a family (Steatornithidae) and suborder (Steatornithes) of its own. Some research indicates that it should even be considered a distinct order (Steatornithiformes).

The specific name &quot;caripensis&quot; means &#x27;of Caripe&#x27;, and the generic name &quot;Steatornis&quot; means &#x27;fat bird&#x27;, in reference to the fatness of the chicks. The oilbird is called a or in Spanish, both terms being of indigenous origin. In Trinidad it was sometimes called (French for &#x27;little devil&#x27;), presumably referring to its loud cries, which have been likened to those of tortured men. The common name &quot;oilbird&quot; comes from the fact that in the past chicks were captured and boiled down in order to make oil.

The fossil record of the family suggests that they were once more widely distributed around the globe. The first fossil oilbird was described by Storrs Olson in 1987 from a fossil found in the Green River Formation in Wyoming. The species, &quot;Prefica nivea&quot;, was probably not adapted to hovering flight or living in caves, unlike the oilbird. Some of the same families and genera of plants the present day oilbird feeds on have been found in the Green River Formation, suggesting that prehistoric species may have eaten the same fruit and spread the same seeds. Another species from the Upper Eocene has been discovered in France.

==Description==
This is a large, slim bird at , with a wing span of . It has a flattened, powerfully hooked, beak surrounded by deep chestnut rictal bristles up to long. The adult weighs but the chicks can weigh considerably more, at up to , when their parents feed them a good deal of fruit before they fly. The feathers of the oilbird are soft like those of many nightbirds, but not as soft as those of owls or nightjars, as they do not need to be silent like predatory species. The oilbird is mainly reddish-brown with white spots on the nape and wings. Lower parts are cinnamon-buff with white diamond-shaped spots edged in black, these spots start small towards the throat and get larger towards the back. The stiff tail feathers are a rich brown spotted with white on either side.

The feet are small and almost useless, other than for clinging to vertical surfaces. The long wings have evolved to make it capable of hovering and twisting flight, which enables it to navigate through restricted areas of its caves. For example, the wings have deep wingtip slotting, like New World vultures, to reduce the stalling speed, and the wings have a low aspect ratio and low wing-loading, all to make the oilbird capable of flying at low speeds.

The eyes of oilbirds are highly adapted to nocturnal foraging. The eyes are small, but the pupils are relatively large, allowing the highest light-gathering capacity of any bird (f-number of 1.07). The retina is dominated by rod cells, 1,000,000 rods per mm2, the highest density of any vertebrate eye, which are organised in layers, an arrangement unique among birds but shared by deep-sea fish. They have low numbers of cone cells, and the whole arrangement would allow them to capture more light in low light conditions but probably have poor vision in daylight.

Although they have specially adapted vision to forage by sight, they are among the few birds known to supplement sight by echolocation in sufficiently poor light conditions, using a series of sharp audible clicks for this purpose. The only other birds known to do this are some species of swift. 

In addition to clicks used for echolocation, oilbirds also produce a variety of harsh screams while in their caves. Entering a cave with a light especially provokes these raucous calls; they also may be heard as the birds prepare to emerge from a cave at dusk.

==Distribution and habitat==

The oilbird ranges from Guyana and the island of Trinidad to Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil. They range from sea-level to . The species has highly specific habitat requirements, needing both caves to breed in and roost in frequently, and forest containing fruiting trees. Where suitable caves are absent, oilbirds will roost and breed in narrow gorges and grottos with suitable rock shelves.

One such colony in Ecuador held a population of a hundred birds in a canyon with ledges protected by vegetation. Some smaller caves and gorges are used only for roosting. While it was once thought that oilbirds always or nearly always roosted in caves, canyons or gullies, researchers placing GPS trackers on non-breeding birds found that they regularly roost in trees in the forest as well as in caves.

It is a seasonal migrant across some of its range, moving from its breeding caves in search of fruit trees. It has occurred as a rare vagrant to Costa Rica, Panama and Aruba. The Guácharo Cave (Oilbird Cave), in the mountainous Caripe district of northern Monagas, Venezuela, is where Alexander von Humboldt first studied the species.

==Behaviour==
Oilbirds are nocturnal. During the day the birds rest on cave ledges and leave at night to find fruit outside the cave. It was once thought that oilbirds only roosted in caves, and indeed never saw daylight, but studies using GPS/acceleration loggers found that non-breeding birds only roosted in caves or other rock shelters one night in three, the other nights roosting in trees.

The scientists responsible for the discovery also found that birds roosting in caves were highly active through the night, whereas birds roosting in the forest were far less active. They hypothesised that each environment carried costs; birds roosting in the forest were more vulnerable to predators and birds roosting in caves expended considerable energy competing with rivals and defending nesting and roosting ledges.

===Breeding===

Oilbirds are colonial cave nesters. The nest is a heap of droppings, usually above water—either a stream or the sea—on which 2–4 glossy white eggs are laid which soon become stained brown. These are rounded but with a distinctly pointed smaller end and average by . The become very fat before fledging, weighing around a third more than the adult birds.

==Status and conservation==
The Guácharo Cave was Venezuela&#x27;s first national monument and is the centerpiece of a national park; according to some estimates there may be 15,000 or more birds living there. Colombia also has a national park named after its &quot;Cueva de los Guácharos&quot;, near the southern border with Ecuador. Oilbirds have been reported in various other places along the Andean mountain chain, including near Ecuador&#x27;s Cueva de los Tayos and in Brazil: they are known to dwell as far south as the Carrasco National Park in Bolivia. Dunston Cave, at the Asa Wright Nature Centre in Trinidad, is home to about 200 nesting pairs. The species is classified as &#x27;Least Concern&#x27; by the IUCN red list as of October 2016, despite a decreasing population.

<text>Steatornithidae is an family of birds containing a single extant species, the oilbird. It also contains the extinct genus &quot;Euronyctibius&quot;.

Steatornithidae is currently considered the only member of the order Steatornithiformes, however, in the past, it was classified in the order Caprimulgiformes, along with all other members of Strisores. Before that, it was part of a paraphyletic Caprimulgiformes consisting of the nocturnal strisoreans.

<text>Sporgery is the disruptive act of posting a flood of articles to a Usenet newsgroup, with the article headers falsified so that they appear to have been posted by others. The word is a portmanteau of &quot;spam&quot; and &quot;forgery&quot;, coined by German software developer, and critic of Scientology, Tilman Hausherr.

Sporgery resembles IRC flooding, which is also intended to disrupt a forum. However, sporgery is not merely disruptive but also deceptive or libellous because it involves falsifying the headers of objectionable posts so they appear to originate from newsgroup regulars. The purpose is not merely to jam the forum, but also to sully the reputations of its regular users by falsely signing their names to offensive posts.

According to internet security company ESET, sporgery was one of the vulnerabilities of the Usenet model which &quot;probably contributed to a decline in [its] general use&quot;.

==Origins in alt.religion.scientology==

The word &quot;sporgery&quot; was coined in the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, an Internet newsgroup where people discuss the controversial belief system of Scientology. One of the various actions of the &quot;war&quot; between Scientology and the Internet involved various individuals who had posted more than a million forged newsgroup articles to the newsgroup, using the message headers (valid names and e-mail addresses) of articles written by Scientology critics and other legitimate posters, and appending to those headers the bodies of other articles harvested from racist newsgroups. The result was to flood the newsgroup with over a million forged articles that made the other posters appear to be hateful &quot;racist bigots&quot;. Critics accused Scientology of planning and conducting the spam flood, though the organization denied this.

The apparent intent of this attack was to render the newsgroup useless for discussion and criticism of Scientology. Another purpose may have been to lower the reputation of the posters so that people would not take their criticisms of Scientology seriously.

At the peak of this attack, the attackers had six computers posting sporgeries into the newsgroup, dumping into USENET an average of 170 megabytes in 44,075 articles every month. From October 1998 to September 1999, 1,462,390,911 sporgery bytes were detected: that figure does not include what was canceled (deleted from USENET) before it could propagate. Just before the sporgery attack ended, sporgery posts were responsible for over 90% of the newsgroup&#x27;s traffic.

To accomplish the sporgery attack, the spammers used several methods to acquire Internet access. Open NNTP servers were used when available, to such an extent that a great many had to be closed by their owners. When open NNTP servers subsequently became scarce, open proxies were used. These proxies allowed Scientology partisans to use someone else&#x27;s computer hardware to sporge. Because default security policies in many proxy server products at the time (late 1990s) were lax, many such proxies were available for abuse. Since that time, open proxies have become the most popular resource for other spammers to abuse, eclipsing open relays and other insecure hosts.

The third method used to acquire newsgroup posting access, and the method used the most, was to use volunteers to go out and buy Internet dialup access from an Internet service provider using a false name and address, and using cash or a money order. These agents were given a large amount of cash and air fare to fly to another city, specifically to acquire Internet access for later use in sporging. Tory Bezazian was one such volunteer. She later left Scientology and publicly confessed to performing this task, and disclosed the names of the Scientology staff members who she said were in charge of the sporgery project.

The sporgery attack against alt.religion.scientology ended a few months after the name and address of one of the perpetrators was acquired by one of the victims, at which time the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation got involved. No indictments were made, nor were there any arrests.

==Other sporgery attacks==
Since the emergence of this technique of disrupting a newsgroup, a few other groups have been targeted this way. One, &quot;news.admin.net-abuse.email,&quot; is used for discussion of spamming and other email abuse problems. A person or persons using the pseudonym &quot;Hipcrime&quot; have attacked this and other groups with sporgeries, usually nonsense or Dissociated Press text posted under random names of legitimate posters. Sporgery is also common in warez newsgroups.

<text>Potoos (family Nyctibiidae) are a group of birds related to the nightjars and frogmouths. They are sometimes called poor-me-ones, after their haunting calls. The family Nyctibiidae was formerly included with the nightjars in the order Caprimulgiformes but is now placed in a separate order, Nyctibiiformes. There are seven species in two genera in tropical Central and South America. Fossil evidence indicates that they also inhabited Europe during the Paleogene.

Potoos are nocturnal insectivores that lack the bristles around the mouth found in the true nightjars. They hunt from a perch like a shrike or flycatcher. During the day they perch upright on tree stumps, camouflaged to look like part of the stump. The single spotted egg is laid directly on the top of a stump.

In Argentina, they are known as kakuy or cacuy from Quechua meaning &#x27;to remain&#x27;. In Bolivia they are called &quot;guajojo&quot;, for the sound of their call. In Brazil and Paraguay, they are called urutau from Guaraní &quot;guyra&quot; &#x27;bird&#x27; and &quot;tau&quot; &#x27;ghost&#x27;.

==Evolution and taxonomy==

The potoos today are exclusively found in the Americas, but they apparently had a much more widespread distribution in the past. Fossil remains of potoos dating from the Eocene have been found in Germany. A complete skeleton of the genus &quot;Paraprefica&quot; has been found in Messel, Germany. It had skull and leg features similar to those of modern potoos, suggesting that it may be an early close relative of the modern potoos. Because the only fossils other than these ancient ones that have been found are recent ones of extinct species, it is unknown if the family once had a global distribution which has contracted, or if the distribution of the family was originally restricted to Europe and has shifted to the Americas.

A 1996 study of the mitochondrial DNA of the potoos supported the monophyly of the family although it did not support the previous assumption that it was closely related to the oilbirds. The study also found a great deal of genetic divergence between the species, suggesting that these species are themselves very old. The level of divergence is the highest of any genus of birds, being more typical of the divergence between genera or even families. The northern potoo was for a long time considered to be the same species as the common potoo, but the two species have now been separated on the basis of their calls. In spite of this there is no morphological way to separate the two species.

The family Nyctibiidae was introduced (as Nyctibie) in 1853 by the French naturalists Jean-Charles Chenu and Œillet des Murs. Prior to this, its species were classified in the Caprimulgidae.

=== Species ===
The family Nyctibiidae contains seven species in two genera:
* Family Nyctibiidae 
** Subfamily Nyctibiinae 
*** Genus &quot;Phyllaemulor&quot; 
**** Rufous potoo, &quot;Phyllaemulor bracteatus&quot; (
*** Genus &quot;Nyctibius&quot; 
**** Great potoo, &quot;Nyctibius grandis&quot; 
**** Long-tailed potoo, &quot;Nyctibius aethereus&quot; 
**** Northern potoo, &quot;Nyctibius jamaicensis&quot; 
**** Common potoo or lesser potoo, &quot;Nyctibius griseus&quot; 
**** Andean potoo, &quot;Nyctibius maculosus&quot; 
**** White-winged potoo, &quot;Nyctibius leucopterus&quot; 
Prior to 2018, &quot;Nyctibius&quot; was considered the only extant genus within the Nyctibiidae; however, a study that year found a deep divergence between the rufous potoo and all other species in the genus, leading it to be described in the new genus &quot;Phyllaemulor&quot; and expanding the number of genera within the family. This was followed by the International Ornithological Congress in 2022.

In addition, the fossil genus &quot;Paraprefica&quot;, the only member of the extinct subfamily Parapreficinae, is known from the Eocene of Germany (the Messel pit), marking the earliest fossil evidence of potoos. The fossil genus &quot;Euronyctibius&quot;, from the Oligocene of France, was formerly considered a potoo, but analysis supports it instead being a close relative of the oilbird (family Steatornithidae).

==Description==
The potoos are a highly conservative family in appearance, with all the species closely resembling one another; species accounts in ornithological literature remark on their unusual appearance. Potoos range from in length. They resemble upright sitting nightjars, a closely related family (Caprimulgidae). They also resemble the frogmouths of Australasia, which are stockier and have much heavier bills. They have proportionally large heads for their body size and long wings and tails. The large head is dominated by a massive broad bill and enormous eyes. In the treatment of the family in the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;, Cohn-Haft describes the potoos as &quot;little more than a flying mouth and eyes&quot;. The bill, while large and broad, is also short, barely projecting past the face. It is delicate, but has a unique &quot;tooth&quot; on the cutting edge of the upper mandible that may assist in foraging. Unlike the closely related nightjars, the potoos lack rictal bristles around the mouth. The legs and feet are weak and used only for perching.

The eyes are large, even larger than those of nightjars. As in many species of nocturnal birds, they reflect the light of flashlights. Their eyes, which could be conspicuous to potential predators during the day, have unusual slits in the lids, which allow potoos to sense movement even when their eyes are closed. Their plumage is cryptic, helping them blend into the branches on which they spend their days.

==Distribution and habitat==
The potoos have a Neotropical distribution. They range from Mexico to Argentina, with the greatest diversity occurring in the Amazon Basin, which holds five species. They are found in every Central and South American country. They also occur on three Caribbean islands: Jamaica, Hispaniola and Tobago. The potoos are generally highly sedentary, although there are occasional reports of vagrants, particularly species that have traveled on ships. All species occur in humid forests, although a few species also occur in drier forests.

==Behavior==
The potoos are highly nocturnal and generally do not fly during the day. They spend the day perched on branches with the eyes half closed. With their cryptic plumage they resemble stumps, and should they detect potential danger they adopt a &quot;freeze&quot; position which even more closely resembles a broken branch. The transition between perching and the freeze position is gradual and hardly perceptible to the observer.

The English zoologist Hugh Cott, describing &quot;Nyctibius griseus&quot; as &quot;this wonderful bird&quot;, writes that it &quot;habitually selects the top of an upright stump as a receptacle for its egg, which usually occupies a small hollow just, and only just, large enough to contain it ... the stump selected had thrown up a new leader just below the point of fracture ... and the birds sat facing this in such a way that when viewed from behind they came into line and blended with the grey stem.&quot;

===Food and feeding===
Potoos feed at dusk and at night on flying insects. Their typical foraging technique is to perch on a branch and occasionally fly out in the manner of a flycatcher in order to snatch a passing insect. They occasionally fly to vegetation to glean an insect off it before returning to their perch, but they do not attempt to obtain prey from the ground. Beetles form a large part of their diet, but they also take moths, grasshoppers and termites. One northern potoo was found with a small bird in its stomach as well. Having caught an insect, potoos swallow it whole without beating or crushing it.

===Breeding===

Potoos are monogamous breeders and both parents share responsibilities for incubating the egg and raising the chick. The family does not construct a nest of any kind, instead laying the single egg on a depression in a branch or at the top of a rotten stump. The egg is white with purple-brown spots. One parent, often the male, incubates the egg during the day, then the duties are shared during the night. Changeovers to relieve incubating parents and feed chicks are infrequent to minimise attention to the nest, as potoos are entirely reliant on camouflage to protect themselves and their nesting site from predators. The chick hatches about one month after laying and the nestling phase is two months, a considerable length of time for a landbird. The plumage of nestling potoos is white and once they are too large to hide under their parents they adopt the same freeze position as their parents, resembling clumps of fungus.

===Defense===
The behaviors described above suggest that the common potoo adopts different defensive strategies to suit its circumstances. For a lone potoo, or a brooding adult with a potential predator close to the nest, the bird attempts to avoid detection by remaining motionless and relying on camouflage. If ineffective, the potoo breaks cover and attempts to intimidate the predator by opening its beak and eyes wide open while vocalizing or simply flies out of reach. Nocturnal predators rely less on vision for locating prey therefore a different strategy may be required at night.

<doc id="262030" wikidata="Q221737" url="?curid=262030" title="Tim Henman">
<text>Timothy Henry Henman (born 6 September 1974) is a British former professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 4 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) during the early 2000s. Henman won 15 career ATP Tour titles (eleven in singles and four in doubles), including the 2003 Paris Masters. A serve-and-volley player, he was the first British man to reach the singles semifinals of Wimbledon since Roger Taylor in the 1970s. Henman reached six major semifinals, and earned a 40–14 win-loss record with the Great Britain Davis Cup team.

Henman was the British No. 1 player in 1996 and again from 1999 to 2005. He is one of the most successful British players of the Open Era, winning $11,635,542 prize money. In the 2004 New Year Honours, he was appointed an OBE.

Henman started playing tennis before the age of three, and began systematic training in the Slater Squad at eleven. After suffering a serious injury which affected him for the better part of two years, he began touring internationally as a junior and achieved some successes. He rose quickly up the ATP rankings, and by 1996 had reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. For most of his career, Henman was considered a grass court specialist, reaching four Wimbledon semifinals in the five years between 1998 and 2002. He also achieved considerable success on hard courts early in his career, with his first title on the top tier ATP tour won in Sydney with a straight sets win over Carlos Moya. He became comfortable on clay only later in his career, when in 2004 he reached the semifinals of the French Open. Henman retired from professional tennis in late 2007, but remains active on the ATP Champions Tour (a tour for former professional tennis players).

== Early life ==
Henman was born in Oxford, Oxfordshire, as the youngest of a family of three boys. Henman&#x27;s father Anthony, a solicitor, was accomplished at various sports, including tennis, hockey and squash. His mother Jane, a dress designer, played Junior Wimbledon and introduced Tim and his elder brothers, Michael and Richard, to tennis as soon as they could walk on the family&#x27;s grass tennis court. His great-grandfather played at Wimbledon. His maternal grandfather, Henry Billington, played at Wimbledon between 1948 and 1951, and he represented Britain in the Davis Cup in 1948, 1950 and 1951. 

In 1901 his maternal great-grandmother, Ellen Stanwell-Brown, was reputedly the first woman to serve overarm at Wimbledon. His maternal grandmother, Susan Billington, appeared regularly at Wimbledon in the 1950s, playing mixed doubles on Centre Court with her husband Henry, reaching the third round of the ladies&#x27; doubles in 1951, 1955 and 1956.

Henman grew up in Weston-on-the-Green, Oxfordshire, a village between Oxford and Bicester with a population of around 500. At home, the family owned a grass tennis court in their back garden. Henman began playing tennis before the age of three with a shortened squash racket. At this stage, he was already teaching himself how to serve and volley. At an early stage in his life, Henman decided if he did not succeed in tennis, he would become a golfer instead.

Henman attended the Longbridge School for boys between the ages of five and seven, and was enrolled in the private Dragon School in Oxford from seven to 11. He excelled in all sports but was always best at tennis. But Henman was small for his age, a factor which would bode against him in the future. In 1985, he was appointed the school&#x27;s captain of tennis and led the school&#x27;s tennis team to win 21 out of 27 matches. He remains to this day the only pupil who has won both the school&#x27;s junior and senior tennis tournaments in the same year. From the age of eight until his introduction to the Slater Squad, Henman received coaching from the David Lloyd Tennis Centre, where he was given personal lessons by former professional player Onny Parun from New Zealand. In retrospect, Parun stated that Henman&#x27;s greatest strength &quot;had always been his head.&quot; David Lloyd noticed the same mental toughness and was impressed.

He left the Dragon School after he attained a scholarship for Reed&#x27;s School in Cobham, Surrey. Henman received the scholarship after a physical test: to run until you dropped. Henman, along with Marc Moreso and David Loosemore, did not drop, and was given a scholarship. At this point in his life, Lloyd persuaded Henman&#x27;s parents to allow him to pursue a tennis career. In retrospect, Lloyd notes, Henman&#x27;s parents understood what many don&#x27;t: &quot;you can always go back to higher education at 22 or 23 but that that is far too late to start a serious tennis career.&quot; 

Henman was picked up by the Slater Squad, a group funded by financier Jim Slater, at the age of 11. The main goal of the Slater Squad was to pick and coach young players from the ages of nine or ten, instead of 11 and 12 as the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) did. The original intake for the squad was eight players between the ages of eight and 11. In addition to Tim, the squad consisted of Jamie Delgado, Gary Le Pla, Paul Jessop, James Bailey, Adrian Blackman, James Davidson and Marc Moreso. In the squad, Henman worked on tennis three hours a day: two hours playing tennis and receiving advice from Donald Watt, and the last hour on gymnastics and learning about the game. In contrast to popular belief, Henman was not considered the best of the bunch, and Sue Barker, the British 1976 French Open Women&#x27;s champion, judged that there was &quot;nothing particularly special in his game in those days&quot;. She notes, however, that while Henman did not have the natural skills of a tennis player, he was &quot;a hard worker&quot;. None of his fellow players in the Slater Squad saw Henman as a potential British number one, with most believing Marc Moreso to be the group&#x27;s brightest hope. Not long after becoming a member of the Slater Squad, Henman was diagnosed with osteochondritis, a bone disease. He was unable to play tennis for six months, and it was two years before he could return to tournaments. Luckily for Henman, Slater kept funding him while he was recuperating, because of insistence from Lloyd who believed in Henman&#x27;s tennis abilities.

At Reed&#x27;s School he passed ten GCSE exams, but failed chemistry. Outside of school, he worked in Anji&#x27;s emporium in order to save money for a new racquet. As Henman notes in retrospect, &quot;I passed the others with a few As, a few Bs and a few Cs. It was nothing dazzling by any means, but I got by.&quot; At the age of 16, Henman told his mother that it was impossible for him to retain his good grades while keeping up in the tennis world. In 1990 he dropped out of school altogether and focused on becoming a singles player, though Lloyd and the leadership of the Slater Squad had confidence in him as a doubles player, not singles. On the statistics that were available to them, Henman had managed to win five doubles tournaments but only two singles tournaments. But Henman disagreed with the Slater Squad leadership and began playing for the LTA in 1991. At the age of 17, Henman toured South America for eight weeks.

== Personal life ==
On 11 December 1999, Henman married his longtime girlfriend, TV producer Lucy Heald, in Hampshire. They have three daughters, Rose Elizabeth (born 19 October 2002), Olivia Susan (born 15 December 2004), and Grace (born 14 September 2007). Having lived in Barnes, southwest London, the family moved in 2003 to a Grade 2 listed property in Aston Tirrold, south Oxfordshire. Henman occasionally smoked cigarettes during his tennis career. He is a supporter of Oxford United.

His father died on 3 May 2024 from blood cancer.

== Tennis career ==

=== Junior tour ===
During his first tour year in 1991, Henman fared badly. He won the first round in the New South Wales Championship against Andrew Turner, 6–1, 6–3, but lost in the second round to Corrado Borroni 5–7, 1–6. He was defeated by Australian Michael Hill in the first round of the 1991 Australian Open junior class, 7–5, 3–6, 5–7. At the National Championships the same year, he reached the third round, but was defeated 6–1, 6–2 by Andrew Richardson. His performance in doubles matches was markedly better. Henman reached the quarter-finals in the New South Wales Championship with Richardson, and won the Midland Bank Junior Championship in doubles with Jamie Delgado, an associate from the Slater Squad days.

1992 began well, with Henman reaching the finals in Nottingham after defeating Delgado in straight sets in the semi-final. But Henman was defeated in the final by top-seed Mark Schofield, and in the junior French Open by Björn Jacob in three sets, 6–7, 6–1, 9–7. He was defeated in the first round of the Wimbledon junior by Mexican clay specialist Enrique Abaroa in straight sets; 6–2, 6–1. However, things improved dramatically from then on, and in the National Junior Championships he reached the semi-finals without dropping a single set. In the semi-finals Henman met Schofield, and defeated him in four sets; 2–6, 6–3, 7–6, 6–2. Henman met Nick Baglin in the final, and won the match 3–6, 7–5, 6–4, 6–4. In 1992 he turned 18, and Henman began his tennis career in the senior satellite tournaments.

=== Professional career ===

==== 1993–1995: early years ====

From July 1992 to July 1993, Henman grew six inches to six feet one, and went from seven stones to nine stones in weight. This would prove important for his career, as he acknowledged: &quot;As a junior I had pretty good technique. Now I&#x27;ve got the strength and reach, and on the serve that has helped tremendously.&quot; Henman was ranked 774th in the world at the beginning of 1993, but by July he had come close to the top 600. In July, Henman received a wildcard to participate in the ATP Challenger tournament in Bristol, England. In the first round, he defeated Colombian Miguel Tobón, ranked 257th, in straight sets, 6–0, 6–3. In the second round he met the Frenchman Éric Winogradsky and defeated him also in straight sets, 7–6, 6–3. Henman was defeated in the quarter-final by British player Chris Bailey, 6–2, 6–1. By November Henman&#x27;s rank had increased to 415th. Henman&#x27;s next tournament was the Volkswagen National Championships in Telford, England; he reached the quarter-final but lost to top-ranked British male player Jeremy Bates, 7–5, 7–6. As 1993 drew to a close, Henman played one last tournament in Israel, which he won.

He started the 1994 season with the four-legged Indian satellite circuit; there he won 18 singles matches in a row. Henman was fairly successful at the British Satellite Masters in Croydon, and by the end of the tournament he was ranked 222nd in the world. Encouraged by his success in the satellite circuit, Henman tried his luck at the ATP tour. Henman travelled to the Far East with Bates, and qualified for his first ATP tournament in April, at the Japan Tennis Championship. In his first round he defeated Kelly Jones, 6–2, 6–3, in the second round he defeated Darren Cahill, 6–2, 7–5 and in the third round Henman was defeated by Pete Sampras, 6–1, 6–2. From this performance Henman increased his ranking to 184th. His success in the Japan Open was followed by a failure to qualify at the Hong Kong Open. Because of this failure, he ended the Far East tour by entering a number of satellite tournaments. Henman entered the Nagoya Open, and defeated eighth seed Eyal Ran in the first round, but lost in the second round to Gouichi Motomura. At the Manila Open, another satellite tournament, Henman reached the final but was defeated by fifth seed Michael Tebbutt, 2–6, 2–6.

After Manila he returned to Europe. In his first Grand Slam bid, Henman failed to qualify in the 1994 French Open, losing the first qualifier round to Australian Wayne Arthurs. His next tournament was the Annenheim Open in Austria, where he lost in the first round to Canadian Sébastien Lareau in straight sets, 6–3, 6–2. However, not all was bad, and Henman, ranked 161st at the time, received a wildcard to qualify for the Stella Artois Championship. In the first round Henman defeated Swedish Peter Lundgren, 7–5, 7–6, but in the second round he succumbed to the eventual champion American Todd Martin, 6–4, 6–4. Henman received a wildcard for the Manchester Open, where he lost in the first round to American Alex O&#x27;Brien, and the Wimbledon Championship, the first Grand Slam he had ever played (he failed to qualify to Wimbledon in 1993). At Wimbledon, Henman lost in the first round to German David Prinosil in four sets, 6–4, 3–6, 2–6, 2–6. His early defeat in Wimbledon forced Henman into short period of obscurity in the satellite circuit. Henman reached the semi-finals at the Bristol Open and the fourth round at the Winnetka Open (in Illinois).

By September Henman was ranked 146th, and in the same month he returned to the Far East. His first tournament in the Far East was the Seoul Open. Henman lost in the second round to Korean Kim Nam-hoon, who was ranked outside the top 700. At the Singapore Challenger, he reached the quarterfinals and lost to fellow Brit Chris Wilkinson. He was forced to retire in the third set against Wilkinson when he fell and received a blow to his leg. When he returned to England not long after the tournament, it was revealed that Henman had broken his ankle in three places and would not play another tournament until February 1995. In fact, he was not fully recovered until May. While injured, his ranking went from 146th to 272nd in the world. That year&#x27;s grass season would prove highly successful for Henman; he reached the semi-finals at the Annenheim Open, later at the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships he reached the second round after defeating German Martin Sinner, and in Nottingham he reached the quarter-finals, his first quarter-final in the ATP tour. His success in these tournaments increased his ranking from 272nd to 219th. To make matters better for Henman, he won his first match ever in a Grand Slam event at the Wimbledon Championship over Kenyan Paul Wekesa in straight sets, 7–6, 6–0, 6–4. However, Henman&#x27;s winning streak did not last long, and in the second round he met Sampras, and was defeated 6–2, 6–3, 7–6. Two days later he partnered Jeremy Bates in the first round of the doubles at Wimbledon but the pair became the first players in the Open era to be defaulted at Wimbledon after Henman accidentally hit a ballgirl on the side of head with a ball, having lashed out with his racket in frustration after losing a point to a net cord in the fourth set tie-break of their match against Jeff Tarango and Henrik Holm. Because he hit the ball in anger, the referee Alan Mills ruled that this was an automatic disqualification for unsportsmanlike conduct. He was very apologetic about the incident, presenting the girl with a bunch of flowers. The rest of the grass season was fairly successful for Henman, he appeared at the Manchester Open and reached the semi-final at the Newcastle Open. At the end of the grass season, Henman&#x27;s rank had risen to 150th in the world.

After the grass season, Henman headed for the United States. He participated in the RCA Championships and defeated 16th seed Frenchmen Cédric Pioline, the 1993 US Open finalist, in straight sets. He lost the following round, but was later able to qualify for the US Open. In the first round, Henman defeated Spanish Juan Albert Viloca in four sets, 6–3, 4–6, 6–3, 6–2. In the second round, Henman was defeated by American Jared Palmer in four sets, 4–6, 7–6, 3–6, 1–6. Henman&#x27;s 1995 end-of-year ranking was 95.

==== 1996–2000: breakthrough ====

Henman climbed up the rankings very quickly. In 1994, he was among the top 200 players in the world; by 1995, among the top 100; and by 1996, he had made it into the top 30 and won a medal at the Atlanta Olympics. He was the UK&#x27;s highest-ranked player that year, and won the &quot;Most Improved Player&quot; trophy at the ATP awards. He was subsequently elected to the ATP Tour Player Council and went on to win his first championship in January 1997. In March of that year, he underwent surgery on his elbow which kept him out of action for two months.

Henman came to the attention of the wider tennis world in 1996 when he came from match point down, saving two successive match points with aces when serving at 3–5 and 15/40, and then breaking his opponent&#x27;s serve twice in a row to win the final set 7–5 and beat reigning French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the first round at Wimbledon, going on to reach the quarter finals before losing to Todd Martin. A few weeks later he was to reach the men&#x27;s doubles final at the 1996 Summer Olympics in partnership with Neil Broad, losing to No. 1 seeds Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to receive the silver medal. By the time he reached the last 16 at the US Open later in the year, he was firmly established as a top player.

He won his first ATP Tour title in January 1997, beating Carlos Moyá at the Sydney International event. He was seeded 14th at Wimbledon, and again reached the quarter-final, defeating reigning champion and 4th seed Richard Krajicek in the fourth round before falling to 1991 champion Michael Stich. In 1998 he went one better, reaching the semi-final for the first time, by which time he was ranked as one of the top 10 ATP players.

Henman came close to reaching the final on a number of occasions, losing in the semi-finals to the eventual champion in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002. The first two of those semi-final losses were to Pete Sampras; in 2001 he lost to Goran Ivanišević, a former two-time finalist; in 2002 he lost to Lleyton Hewitt, ranked number one in the world at the time. In 2000 Henman reached the fourth round at Wimbledon; and in 1996, 1997, 2003 and 2004 he lost in the quarter-finals.

One of the tournaments in which he has been most successful is Queen&#x27;s Club. He reached the final in 1999, where he lost to Pete Sampras, and went on to reach the final again in 2001 and 2002, where both times he lost to Lleyton Hewitt. Based on that success he was expected, at least within England, to be the first man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a major for Britain – which in the end he never managed, Wimbledon 2001 being the closest that he ever came to reaching a final. He became well known for the Henman fist, which would become his trademark on winning a point.

==== 2001–2004: career peak ====
Henman started the 2001 ATP season with a ranking of tenth in the world. At the Adelaide International Henman lost in the semi-finals to Nicolás Massú. His next tournament was the Australian Open; Henman had wins over Hicham Arazi, Nicolás Lapentti, and Wayne Arthurs, but lost to Patrick Rafter in the fourth round in straight sets. He then won the Copenhagen Open, dispatching Andreas Vinciguerra in two sets. Henman then lost in the second round of the Rotterdam Open. Rotterdam was followed by a defeat in the Scottsdale Open. In March, Henman reached the third round at Indian Wells, where he lost to Nicolás Lapentti in straight sets. The hard court season wrapped up with the Miami Masters where Henman lost in round two to Fabrice Santoro.

By the beginning of the clay season in April, Henman&#x27;s ranking had slipped from 10th to 12th in the world. He reached the second round of the Estoril Open, the quarter-finals of Monte-Carlo, round two in Rome, and lost in round one at the Hamburg Masters. At the French Open Henman had wins over Tomas Behrend and Sjeng Schalken, but lost to Guillermo Cañas in five sets in round three. At the end of the clay season, Henman&#x27;s ranking had risen back up to 11th.

On the grass at Queen&#x27;s Club Championships Henman reached the final, where he was defeated in straight sets by Australian Lleyton Hewitt. Many commentators believed Henman had a chance to win that year&#x27;s Wimbledon with several top-seeds being defeated early in the tournament. Henman came through the first three rounds with ease, winning over Artem Derepasko, Martin Lee, and Sjeng Schalken. However, it took five sets to defeat the 22nd American seed Todd Martin in round four. In the quarter-finals Henman beat a young Roger Federer in four tough sets, the latter having defeated Henman&#x27;s longtime nemesis Sampras in the fourth round in the only tour match that Sampras and Federer would ever play. In his semi-final Henman met wildcard entrant, Goran Ivanišević where Ivanišević eventually managed to win in five sets in a match that spanned 3 days because of numerous rain delays. Henman had come back from losing the first set and played some stunning tennis – including crushing Ivanišević in the third set 6–0 – to take the lead by 2 sets to 1 before rain first stopped play. The players returned the following day but Henman couldn&#x27;t recapture his form from the Friday and lost the fourth set in a tie break. Henman had got as close as 2 points from victory but serve was with his opponent and he was not able to hang on. Only 5 games into the deciding set, rain fell again and the players were forced to wait it out overnight to finish the epic encounter. When the pair finally returned on Sunday, Ivanišević was able to wrap up the final set and dash the English player&#x27;s dream of reaching a Wimbledon final.

In August, Henman only reached the second round in the Canada Masters but bounced back and made it to the semi-finals of the Cincinnati Masters. There he lost to Gustavo Kuerten in three sets. His next tournament was nearly as successful, with Henman reaching the quarter-finals at the RCA Championship. Henman lost in the quarter-finals, again to Kuerten in three sets. At the US Open he reached the third round; Henman defeated Vacek and Fernando Meligeni, but was upset by Xavier Malisse in five sets. Near the end of the season, Henman won the Swiss Indoors, by defeating the previous runner-up Roger Federer in straight sets.

In 2002, Henman reached the 4th round at the Australian Open and the semi-finals at Wimbledon for the last time in his career, losing this time to Lleyton Hewitt: for the fourth time, his conqueror in the semi-finals went on to win the tournament. He was defeated in the second round of the French Open, and the third round of the US Open. At the ATP tour, Henman was the runner-up at three finals; at one ATP Masters Series, at one ATP 500 Series and at one normal ATP tournament. Henman did not participate in the 2003 Australian Open, reached the third round in the French Open, his best so far, reached the quarter-finals at the Wimbledon Championship and lost in the first round at the US Open to eventual champion Andy Roddick. He reached two ATP finals in 2003, one of them being the Paris Masters, winning both of them—his victory at the 2003 Paris Masters would be his only victory at an ATP Masters tour event.

In 2004, Henman failed to reach the fourth round of the Australian Open and failed to reach the semi-finals at the Wimbledon Championships. However, he reached, to the surprise of commentators, the semi-finals of the French Open and later, the semi-finals of the US Open. His ATP tour was not as successful, but he managed to reach the finals of the Indian Wells, where he was defeated by world No. 1 Roger Federer in two sets, 3–6, 3–6. 2004 would be the last time Henman participated in the Tennis Masters Cup (a tournament between the eight best players of the world). 2004 would prove Henman&#x27;s last successful year as a tennis player; he failed to reach beyond the third round in any of the Grand Slams from 2005 until his retirement in 2007.

At the Davis Cup World Group Play-off against Austria, Henman and Greg Rusedski played all five rubbers on the Austrian clay, but were beaten 3–2. Henman now decided to withdraw from the Davis Cup to concentrate on his own career.

==== 2005–2007: decline ====
His first tournament in 2005 was the Australian Open. Henman defeated Frenchmen Cyril Saulnier in four sets, 6–1, 6–2, 4–6, 6–3, and defeated Romanian Victor Hănescu in three sets, 7–5, 6–1, 6–4, but lost to the 28th seed Russian Nikolay Davydenko in straight sets; 4–6, 2–6, 2–6. The next tournament was the Rotterdam Open where he reached the third round, being defeated by Croatian Mario Ančić, 5–7, 4–6. He did not fare much better at the Dubai Open, and lost in the third round to Croatian Ivan Ljubičić, 5–7, 4–6. Henman&#x27;s next tournament was the first ATP Masters Series event of the year; at the Indian Wells he reached the quarterfinals after receiving a bye (meaning he could skip the first round). He lost in the quarter-finals to Argentinian Guillermo Cañas, 6–7, 5–7. At the Miami Masters Henman again lost in the quarter-finals, this time to Swiss world no. 1 Roger Federer in straight sets, 4–6, 2–6.

At Henman&#x27;s first clay tournament of 2005, the Monte-Carlo Masters, he lost in the first round to Argentinian Mariano Zabaleta, 4–6, 6–4, 2–6. Henman improved his clay record that year by reaching the third round at both the Italian Open and the Hamburg Masters, but he disappointed his fans by being defeated by Peruvian Luis Horna in the second round of the French Open in four sets, 5–7, 7–6, 3–6, 4–6. In contrast to the clay season, the grass season began well, with Henman reaching the quarter-finals at the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships, losing to Swedish Thomas Johansson, 4–6, 4–6. However, after defeating Jarkko Nieminen in the first round of the Wimbledon Championship, he lost in the second round to Russian Dmitry Tursunov in five sets, 6–3, 2–6, 6–3, 3–6, 6–8. His hard court season was not much better; Henman was defeated in the first or second round in all the remaining tournaments he participated in that year. At the US Open he lost to Spaniard Fernando Verdasco in straight sets, 4–6, 2–6, 2–6. At his last match of the year, Henman was beaten by Britain&#x27;s rising tennis star Andy Murray in the first round in three sets, 3–6, 7–5, 7–6.

His opening tournament of 2006 was the Qatar Open, where he lost in the second round to Tommy Haas 2–6, 6–7 and 7–5 in tie-break. In that year&#x27;s Australian Open he was defeated in the first round by Russian Dmitry Tursunov, 7–5, 3–6, 4–6, 5–7. His early defeat in the Australian Open was followed by success in the Zagreb Open; Henman reached the semi-finals, but was defeated by Stefan Koubek, 3–6, 6–3, 2–6. His success in Zagreb was met by failure at the Rotterdam Open, where he was beaten in the second round by future world no. 1 Novak Djokovic in three sets, 7–5, 3–6, 4–6. At the Dubai Open Henman reached the quarter-finals, but lost the match to the Spanish world no. 2 Rafael Nadal in straight sets; 6–7 (1–7 in tie break), 1–6. Henman was defeated in the second round of Indian Wells by up-and-comer Tomáš Berdych in two sets, 4–6, 4–6. Henman ended an eight-match losing streak against Lleyton Hewitt on 25 March 2006, with a 7–6, 6–3 victory at the Miami Masters tournament, but lost in the third round to unseeded German Simon Greul in three sets; 6–0, 1–6, 5–7. 

He was defeated in the first round of the Monte-Carlo Masters by Argentinian world no. 8 Gastón Gaudio, 1–6, 3–6. At the Italian Open Henman managed to reach the third round, but lost to Nadal, 2–6, 2–6. His success in the Italian Open was met with a defeat in the second round of the French Open by Dmitry Tursunov in four sets; 3–6, 2–6, 6–4, 4–6. His run at the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships was far more successful, with Henman losing to Lleyton Hewitt 6–3, 3–6, 6–2 in the semi-finals.

Henman was unseeded at Wimbledon in 2006 for the first time in a number of years after his world ranking slipped down to number 62. At that Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to eventual champion Federer, 6–4, 6–0, 6–2, after a five-set victory over Robin Söderling of Sweden in the first round. At the US Open, Henman reached the second round where he was defeated by Roger Federer, 3–6, 4–6, 5–7. Following his failure at the US Open, Henman played two tournaments in the far east. Starting in Bangkok, Henman reached the quarter-finals where he lost to Paradorn Srichaphan 6–7, 6–4, 7–6. Henman then reached his first final since 2004 at the AIG Open in Tokyo, losing to Roger Federer, 6–3, 6–3. Although Henman was scheduled to play in both Basel &amp; Paris at the end of the 2006 season, he lost in the second round in Basel against the rising Swiss star Stanislas Wawrinka 2–6, 7–6, 6–4. He twisted a knee; he did not retire but resorted to a less mobile game that saw Wawrinka win.

On Henman&#x27;s last practice session before departing for the Australian Open at the start of 2007, having recovered from his knee injury, he injured his hamstring which forced him to withdraw from the tournament. He returned in time to enter Masters Series events in Indian Wells and Miami after withdrawing from Rotterdam and Zagreb but lost in the first round in both of them. Henman&#x27;s poor luck with injury and form continued into the 2007 clay court season with first round losses to Juan Carlos Ferrero, 5–7, 2–6 in Monaco, Nicolás Almagro, 5–7, 1–6 in Rome and a poor showing against 18-year-old grand slam debutant Ernests Gulbis, 4–6, 3–6, 2–6 in the French Open. Henman&#x27;s clay-court season ended without a set won. His grass court season got underway on 12 June 2007 at Queens Club, but was put to an abrupt end by Croatian wildcard entry Marin Čilić. However, he ended the day with a doubles victory with partner Lleyton Hewitt over Australian Jordan Kerr and Austrian Alexander Peya. An early loss at a grass court event in Nottingham was followed up with a poor showing at Wimbledon, with Henman losing in the second round to Feliciano López in five sets. Henman played three more tournaments before retiring; at his last Grand Slam appearance ever, he lost in the second round of the US Open to Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets; 6–7, 6–2, 5–7, 4–6.

== Retirement and post-playing career==
Henman announced at a press conference on 23 August 2007 that he would retire from tennis after playing in the US Open and Britain&#x27;s Davis Cup tie against Croatia in September 2007.

Henman defeated his rival Dmitry Tursunov (who had won five of their six previous matches) in the first round of the US Open, 6–4, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, in what many had assumed would be his final Grand Slam match. His actual final match was in the next round on 31 August 2007, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 6–7(2–7), 6–2, 5–7, 4–6. Henman seemed sluggish compared to his first-round match, he served for the first set but could not close it out and lost the tiebreaker.

Henman played his final match in the Davis Cup tie against Croatia on 22 September 2007. The doubles match with Jamie Murray was played on Court 1 at Wimbledon which they won, 4–6, 6–4, 7–6, 7–5. The match put Great Britain in an unassailable 3–0 lead and back in the World Group, with the doubles win being added to singles wins the previous day from Henman and Andy Murray. After the match Henman told Sue Barker in an interview on BBC Television and in front of the Court 1 crowd, &quot;It&#x27;s occasions like this and fans like this that I will miss so much&quot;.

At the time of his retirement, Henman had already committed to playing a Charity Exhibition at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall during the Seniors Tennis Event The Blackrock Masters in December 2007. Henman&#x27;s opponent was veteran Swede and former Wimbledon Champion Stefan Edberg, Tim won the pro-set 8–4.

Henman became part of the commentary team for the BBC coverage of the 2008 Wimbledon Championships and has remained there since.

Henman took part in a test event for the adoption of the centre court roof in May 2009, playing mixed doubles with Kim Clijsters against husband and wife team Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf.

Finally he became a member of the AELTC board and became an important member of the Wimbledon organisation. He created his own foundation, called The Tim Henman Foundation, which is to help disadvantaged children.

== Equipment ==
Henman&#x27;s clothing was manufactured by Adidas and he wore Adidas Equipment Barricade shoes. He used Slazenger Pro Braided racquets.

<text>The frogmouths (Podargidae) are a group of nocturnal birds related to owlet-nightjars, swifts, and hummingbirds. Species in the group are distributed in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms.

==Biology==
They are named for their large flattened hooked bill and huge frog-like gape, which they use to capture insects. The three &quot;Podargus&quot; species are large frogmouths restricted to Australia and New Guinea, that have massive flat broad bills. They are known to take larger prey, such as small vertebrates (frogs, mice, etc.), which are sometimes beaten against a stone before swallowing. The ten &quot;Batrachostomus&quot; frogmouths are found in tropical Asia. They have smaller, more rounded bills and are predominantly insectivorous. Both &quot;Podargus&quot; and &quot;Batrachostomus&quot; have bristles around the base of the bill, and &quot;Batrachostomus&quot; has other, longer bristles which may exist to protect the eyes from insect prey. In April 2007, a new species of frogmouth was described from the Solomon Islands and placed in a newly established genus, &quot;Rigidipenna&quot;.

Their flight is weak. They rest horizontally on branches during the day, camouflaged by their cryptic plumage. Through convergent evolution as night hunters, they resemble owls, with large front-facing eyes.

Up to three white eggs are laid in the fork of a branch, and are incubated by the female at night and the male in the day.

==Taxonomy==
DNA-DNA hybridisation studies had suggested that the two frogmouth groups may not be as closely related as previously thought, and that the Asian species may be separable as a new family, the Batrachostomidae. Although frogmouths were formerly included in the order Caprimulgiformes, a 2019 study estimated the divergence between &quot;Podargus&quot; and &quot;Batrachostomus&quot; to between 30 and 50 mya and forming a clade well separated from the nightjars and being a sister group of the swifts, hummingbirds, and owlet-nightjars. The name Podargiformes proposed in 1918 by Gregory Mathews was reinstated for the clade.

== In culture ==
In a journal article published in April 2021, researchers Katja Thömmes and Gregor Hayn-Leichsenring from the Experimental Aesthetics group at the University Hospital Jena, Germany, found the frogmouth to be the most &quot;instagrammable&quot; bird species. Using an algorithm to analyze the aesthetic appeal of more than 27,000 bird photographs on Instagram, they found that photos depicting frogmouths received the highest number of likes relative to the posts&#x27; exposure to users. The journal article was picked up by several news outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

<text>Jorge Armando Arce Armenta (; born July 27, 1979), best known as Jorge Arce, is a Mexican former professional boxer who competed from 1996 to 2014. He is a multiple-time world champion, and the second boxer from Mexico to win world titles in four weight divisions (after Érik Morales, who first achieved the feat two months prior). In a storied career, Arce held the WBO light flyweight title from 1998 to 1999; the WBC and lineal light flyweight titles from 2002 to 2004; the WBO super flyweight title in 2010; the WBO junior featherweight title in 2011; and the WBO bantamweight title from 2011 to 2012. Additionally he held the WBC interim flyweight title from 2005 to 2006, the WBA interim super flyweight title from 2008 to 2009, and challenged once for the WBC featherweight title in his final fight in 2014.

Arce remains a favorite fighter among boxing fans and is also the older brother of title contender Francisco Arce Armenta. Arce&#x27;s trademark ring entrance featured him wearing a black cowboy hat (earning him the nickname &quot;The Mexican Cowboy&quot;) and sucking a cherry lollipop.

==Professional career==
===Early years at light flyweight===
Arce turned pro at the age of 16, winning his first four fights. He lost to future champion Omar Romero and drew with Gabriel Munoz in back-to-back fights in the summer of 1996, but then won 10 straight bouts and a pair of regional belts before losing on points to veteran (and future IBF Light Flyweight Champion) Jose Victor Burgos on December 12, 1997.

He recovered from that setback with four straight wins, earning his first world title shot on December 5, 1998 against Juan Domingo Córdoba for the WBO Light Flyweight title. Arce won the fight and became a world champion at the age of 19.

After making one successful defense of his title, Arce drew a big-money fight in Tijuana against three-time former champion Michael Carbajal on July 31, 1999. Arce was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards after 10 rounds, but in the 11th, the veteran Carbajal connected with a stunning right hand and captured the crown via a technical knockout, as Arce was unable to continue.

After a four-month layoff, Arce returned to the ring and won a WBO regional belt as he scored 7 consecutive wins while working his way back up the rankings for another title shot. That came on October 20, 2001, when he defeated Juanito Rubillar for the Interim WBC version of the Light Flyweight title. Nine months later, he beat Yo-Sam Choi, the reigning Lineal and WBC light flyweight champion who had been out with an injury, to take full distinction. He held the title until the summer of 2005 before relinquishing it to move up in weight. In his first defense, he defeated Augustin Lara. In 2003, he successfully defended his title three times against Ernesto Castro, Lee Marvin Sandoval, and Melchor Cob Castro.

Towards the end of 2003, he participated in the Televisa version of Big Brother, the Big Brother V.I.P. show that put celebrities together. He arrived in third place, then went training for his next defense, against former world champion Joma Gamboa on January 10 of the following year. Arce invited his &quot;Big Brother&quot; celebrity friends to the fight with Gamboa, his first fight of 2004, which he won by a second-round knockout. But during and after the fight, chaos ensued. One of his friends, actress Arleth Gonzalez, was kicked off her chair by another person. And Verónica Castro was pursued by the press when she was trying to leave the fight site, taking her more than two hours to get to the site&#x27;s parking lot.

On April 24, 2004, Arce successfully defended his title in a rematch against former champ Melchor Cob Castro in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas. Arce had beaten Castro in May 2003, but the fight was called off after six rounds due to a clash of heads which injured Arce. The fight went to the scorecards and Arce won a narrow, but controversial, decision. He left no doubt in the rematch, knocking Castro out in the fifth round.

On September 4 of that same year, he retained the title with a twelve-round decision in a rematch with Rubillar. The fight caused some controversy afterwards, when Rubillar&#x27;s manager accused the fight&#x27;s judges of robbing his fighter, going on to offer Arce 100,000 US$ for a rematch, which would be held in the Philippines.

Arce moved on to defend his title for a seventh time on December 18, defeating Juan Centeno by a third-round TKO. He then decided to try his luck in the flyweight (112-pound) weight division.

===Flyweight===
On March 19, 2005, Arce stopped Hussein Hussein in the 10th round of a fight for the right to challenge Pongsaklek Wonjongkam for his WBC Flyweight title. He later relinquished his light flyweight crown and was matched by the WBC with Angel Priolo on July 30 for their interim title after Wonjongkam suffered an injury. Arce scored a third-round TKO win in the fight, held in La Paz, Mexico.

While waiting to fight Wongjongkam, Arce stayed busy by rematching Hussein on October 8 in Las Vegas. He retained his Interim WBC title with a second-round knockout.

On December 16, 2005, Arce defeated former two-time champion Adonis Rivas by 10th round tko. In his next bout, Arce defeated Rivas in a rematch.

On April 8, 2006, Arce took on the well regarded, former WBA Minimumweight and Light Flyweight Champion Rosendo Alvarez of Nicaragua, knocking Alvarez out in the sixth round. It was the 4th successful defense of his Interim Flyweight title.

===Super flyweight===
On September 23, 2006, he moved up to the super flyweight division where he defeated former Light Flyweight Champion Masibulele &quot;Hawk&quot; Makepula by fourth-round knockout (which, according to the HBO commentators, he had predicted earlier). On January 27, 2007, he defeated Argentinian Julio Ler in a 12-round decision, thus earning the WBC #1 super-flyweight ranking.

On April 14, 2007, he lost a 12-round unanimous decision to WBC Super Flyweight Champion Cristian Mijares in San Antonio, Texas. Mijares won the fight by a wide margin, with the official judges scoring the match 119–109, 118–110, 117–111, all in favor of Mijares.

Arce rebounded from the loss by defeating future champion Tomás Rojas by 6th-round technical knockout. On December 1, 2007, Arce defeated former Flyweight Champion Medgoen Singsurat by technical knockout in the first round.

On May 17, 2008, in a very close fight, Arce (49–4–1, 37 KOs) edged Devid Lookmahanak of Thailand (18–2, 9 KOs) with a majority decision in the main event at the Plaza Monumental Aguascalientes in Aguascalientes, Mexico. With a sold-out crowd of 18,000 fans cheering him on, Arce had to dig deep and work hard to pull past the once-beaten Lookmahanak, who turned out to be a very game southpaw and rarely took a step back. The difference in the fight, which also gave Arce the win, was a knockdown in the seventh round. The scores were 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114. Without the extra point for the knockdown, the fight would have been scored a draw. The bout was an eliminator for a shot at the WBC Super Flyweight title. Arce moves on to a rematch with Cristian Mijares, who earlier captured the WBA&#x27;s version of the title with a points win over Alexander Muñoz.

On September 15, 2008, Arce won the Interim WBA Super Flyweight title from holder Rafael Concepción.

Arce blasted former champion Isidro García, on November 1, 2008, via (48 seconds of the) 4th round technical knockout for a super flyweight belt. He improved to 51–4–1, with 38 wins inside the distance, while Garcia, who has lost 3 of his last 4 fights, was down to 25–6–2.

On February 7, 2009, Arce was defeated by Undisputed Super Flyweight Champion Vic Darchinyan.

Arce fought Simphiwe Nongqayi on September 15, 2009 for the IBF Super Flyweight title which was recently vacated by Darchinyan. However, he ended losing by unanimous decision.

Arce defeated Indonesian Angky Angkota on January 30, 2010, winning the vacant WBO Super Flyweight title. Prior to the bout, Arce stated that he would retire from boxing if he would have lost.

===Bantamweight===
On April 24, 2010, Arce jumped to the bantamweight division to fight fellow Mexican Cecilio Santos (24–13–3; 14 KO) at the Centro de Usos Multiples in Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, Mexico. Arce defeated his opponent by KO in the 7th round, improving his record to 54–6–1. This was not his first fight as a bantamweight: he already fought once in the weight class in 2007.

Arce was scheduled to fight Eric Morel (42–2; 21 KO) of Puerto Rico on June 26, 2010 at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, United States with the Interim WBO Bantamweight title at stake. The Los Mochis native withdrew from the fight a few weeks in advance due to a cut he received while in training.

In his next fight, on July 31, 2010, Arce took on fellow Mexican and former champion Martín &quot;El Gallo&quot; Castillo at the Palenque de la Feria in Tepic, Nayarit, Mexico. The Los Mochis native won the bout by KO in the first round.

===Super bantamweight===
On May 7, 2011, as a heavy underdog, he beat a then undefeated WBO Super Bantamweight Champion, Wilfredo Vazquez, Jr. of Puerto Rico by twelfth-round technical knockout. He avenged his prior loss to former champion Simphiwe Nongqayi in defense of his title.

===Bantamweight===
Arce moved down to the bantamweight division to face Angky Angkotta in a rematch for the vacant WBO bantamweight title. He defeated Angkotta by unanimous decision.

===Return to super bantamweight===
On February 18, 2012, he defeated former champion Lorenzo Parra. In his next fight, he faced future featherweight title holder Jesus Rojas. Arce dropped Rojas in the opening round, however, the fight ended in a no-contest in the 2nd round after Rojas delivered a series of fowls rendering Arce unable to continue. 

He then moved up to the featherweight division and defeated former champion Mauricio Martínez.

On December 15, 2012, Arce fought WBO Super Bantamweight champion Nonito Donaire. He suffered a defeat on the third round via knockout. After losing to Donaire, Arce announced his retirement. 

===Featherweight===
Arce announced his return to the ring a year later in the featherweight division. After scoring three consecutive wins, he challenged WBC World Featherweight champion Jhonny Gonzalez, however, he was defeated by 11th round TKO. He retired after the bout.

==Life outside of boxing==
Arce has gained some popularity outside the ring as well, acting in various Televisa comedy sketches, and participating in Adal Ramones&#x27;s show&#x27;s dancing contest, &quot;Bailando por un Sueño&quot;, where he and a fellow contestant arrived in eighth place out of nine couples. He has also done boxing commentary for TV Azteca.

<text>Mammography (also called mastography; DICOM modality: MG) is the process of using low-energy X-rays (usually around 30 kVp) to examine the human breast for diagnosis and screening. The goal of mammography is the early detection of breast cancer, typically through detection of characteristic masses, microcalcifications, asymmetries, and distortions.

As with all X-rays, mammograms use doses of ionizing radiation to create images. These images are then analyzed for abnormal findings. It is usual to employ lower-energy X-rays, typically Mo (K-shell X-ray energies of 17.5 and 19.6 keV) and Rh (20.2 and 22.7 keV) than those used for radiography of bones. Mammography may be 2D or 3D (tomosynthesis), depending on the available equipment or purpose of the examination. Ultrasound, ductography, positron emission mammography (PEM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are adjuncts to mammography. Ultrasound is typically used for further evaluation of masses found on mammography or palpable masses that may or may not be seen on mammograms. Ductograms are still used in some institutions for evaluation of bloody nipple discharge when the mammogram is non-diagnostic. MRI can be useful for the screening of high-risk patients, for further evaluation of questionable findings or symptoms, as well as for pre-surgical evaluation of patients with known breast cancer, in order to detect additional lesions that might change the surgical approach (for example, from breast-conserving lumpectomy to mastectomy).

In 2023, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued a draft recommendation statement that all women should receive a screening mammography every two years from age 40 to 74. The American College of Radiology, Society of Breast Imaging, and American Cancer Society recommend yearly screening mammography starting at age 40. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (2012) and the European Cancer Observatory (2011) recommend mammography every 2 to 3 years between ages 50 and 69. These task force reports point out that in addition to unnecessary surgery and anxiety, the risks of more frequent mammograms include a small but significant increase in breast cancer induced by radiation. Additionally, mammograms should not be performed with increased frequency in patients undergoing breast surgery, including breast enlargement, mastopexy, and breast reduction.

== Types ==

===Digital===
Digital mammography is a specialized form of mammography that uses digital receptors and computers instead of X-ray film to help examine breast tissue for breast cancer. The electrical signals can be read on computer screens, permitting more manipulation of images to allow radiologists to view the results more clearly. The standard digital mammography is &quot;full field&quot; (FFDM), in which the entire breast is imaged in a single view. Digital mammography can also include the use of &quot;spot views&quot;, in which a paddle is used to further compress areas of concern.

Digital mammography is also utilized in stereotactic biopsy. Breast biopsy may also be performed using a different modality, such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

While radiologists had hoped for more marked improvement, the effectiveness of digital mammography was found comparable to traditional X-ray methods in 2004, though there may be reduced radiation with the technique and it may lead to fewer retests. Specifically, it performs no better than film for post-menopausal women, who represent more than three-quarters of women with breast cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against digital mammography over basic film mammography for breast cancer screening.

Digital mammography is a NASA spin-off, utilizing technology developed for the Hubble Space Telescope. As of 2022, over 99% of certified mammography centers in the United States screening centers use digital mammography. Globally, systems by Fujifilm Corporation are the most widely used. In the United States, GE&#x27;s digital imaging units typically cost US$300,000 to $500,000, far more than film-based imaging systems. Costs may decline as GE begins to compete with the less expensive Fuji systems.

=== 3D mammography ===
Three-dimensional mammography, also known as digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), tomosynthesis, and 3D breast imaging, is a mammogram technology that creates a 3D view of the breast using X-rays from different angles. Supplementing standard 2D mammography with DBT has been shown to improve cancer detection. Cost effectiveness is unclear as of 2016. Another concern is that it more than doubles the radiation exposure.

=== Photon counting ===
Photon-counting mammography was introduced commercially in 2003 and was shown to reduce the X-ray dose to the patient by approximately 40% compared to conventional methods while maintaining image quality at an equal or higher level. The technology was subsequently developed to enable spectral imaging with the possibility to further improve image quality, to distinguish between different tissue types, and to measure breast density.

=== Galactography ===
A galactography (or breast ductography) is a now infrequently used type of mammography used to visualize the milk ducts. Prior to the mammography itself, a radiopaque substance is injected into the duct system. This test is indicated when nipple discharge exists.

== Medical uses ==

Mammography can detect cancer early when it’s most treatable and can be treated less invasively (thereby helping to preserve quality of life).

According to National Cancer Institute data, since mammography screening became widespread in the mid-1980s, the U.S. breast cancer death rate, unchanged for the previous 50 years, has dropped well over 30 percent. In European countries like Denmark and Sweden, where mammography screening programs are more organized, the breast cancer death rate has been cut almost in half over the last 20 years.

Mammography screening cuts the risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half. A recent study published in &quot;Cancer&quot; showed that more than 70 percent of the women who died from breast cancer in their 40s at major Harvard teaching hospitals were among the 20 percent of women who were not being screened. Some scientific studies have shown that the most lives are saved by screening beginning at age 40.

A recent study in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; shows that early detection of breast cancer – as with mammography – significantly improves breast cancer survival.

The benefits of mammography screening at decreasing breast cancer mortality in randomized trials are not found in observational studies performed long after implementation of breast cancer screening programs (for instance, Bleyer et al.)

== When to start screening ==
In 2014, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Institutes of Health reported the occurrence rates of breast cancer based on 1000 women in different age groups. In the 40–44 age group, the incidence was 1.5 and in the 45–49 age group, the incidence was 2.3. In the older age groups, the incidence was 2.7 in the 50–54 age group and 3.2 in the 55–59 age group.

While screening between ages 40 and 50 is somewhat controversial, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that there is a benefit in terms of early detection. Currently, the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American College of Radiology, and the Society of Breast Imaging encourage annual mammograms beginning at age 40.

The National Cancer Institute encourages mammograms every one to two years for women ages 40 to 49. In 2023, United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) revised the recommendation that women and transgender men undergo biennial mammograms starting at the age of 40, rather than the previously suggested age of 50. This adjustment is prompted by the increasing incidence of breast cancer in the 40 to 49 age group over the past decade.

In contrast, the American College of Physicians, a large internal medicine group, has recently encouraged individualized screening plans as opposed to wholesale biannual screening of women aged 40 to 49. The American Cancer Society recommendations for women at average risk for breast cancer is a yearly mammogram from age 45 to 54 with an optional yearly mammogram from age 40 to 44.

== Screening for high-risk population ==
Women who are at high risk for early-onset breast cancer have separate recommendations for screening. These include those who:

* Have a known &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene mutation.
* Have a 1st-degree relative (parent, brother, sister, or child), 2nd-degree relative (aunts, uncles, nieces, or grandparents), or 3rd-degree relative with a known &quot;BRCA1&quot; or &quot;BRCA2&quot; gene mutation.
* Have a lifetime risk of breast cancer &gt;20% according to risk assessment tools
* History of radiation therapy to chest between 10 and 30 years of age
* Have or has a 1st-degree relative with a genetic syndrome including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome

The American College of Radiology recommends these individuals to get annual mammography starting at the age of 30. Those with a history of chest radiation therapy before age 30 should start annually at age 25 of 8 years after their latest therapy (whichever is latest). The American Cancer Society also recommends women at high risk should get a mammogram and breast MRI every year beginning at age 30 or an age recommended by their healthcare provider.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) advocates screening for women who possess a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or have a first-degree relative with such a mutation, even in the absence of the patient being tested for BRCA1/2 mutations. For women at high risk, NCCN recommends undergoing an annual mammogram and breast MRI between the ages of 25 and 40, considering the specific gene mutation type or the youngest age of breast cancer occurrence in the family. Additionally, NCCN suggests that high-risk women undergo clinical breast exams every 6 to 12 months starting at age 25. These individuals should also engage in discussions with healthcare providers to assess the advantages and disadvantages of 3D mammography and acquire knowledge on detecting changes in their breasts.

== Adverse effects ==

=== Radiation ===
The radiation exposure associated with mammography is a potential risk of screening, which appears to be greater in younger women. In scans where women receive 0.25–20 Gray (Gy) of radiation, they have more of an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. A study of radiation risk from mammography concluded that for women 40 years of age and older, the risk of radiation-induced breast cancer was minuscule, particularly compared with the potential benefit of mammographic screening, with a benefit-to-risk ratio of 48.5 lives saved for each life lost due to radiation exposure. This also correlates to a decrease in breast cancer mortality rates by 24%.

===Pain===
The mammography procedure can be painful. Reported pain rates range from 6–76%, with 23–95% experiencing pain or discomfort. Experiencing pain is a significant predictor in women not re-attending screening. There are few proven interventions to reduce pain in mammography, but evidence suggests that giving women information about the mammography procedure prior to it taking place may reduce the pain and discomfort experienced. Furthermore, research has found that standardised compression levels can help to reduce patients&#x27; pain while still allowing for optimal diagnostic images to be produced.

== Procedure ==
During the procedure, the breast is compressed using a dedicated mammography unit. Parallel-plate compression evens out the thickness of breast tissue to increase image quality by reducing the thickness of tissue that X-rays must penetrate, decreasing the amount of scattered radiation (scatter degrades image quality), reducing the required radiation dose, and holding the breast still (preventing motion blur). In screening mammography, both head-to-foot (craniocaudal, CC) view and angled side-view (mediolateral oblique, MLO) images of the breast are taken. Diagnostic mammography may include these and other views, including geometrically magnified and spot-compressed views of the particular area of concern. Deodorant, talcum powder or lotion may show up on the X-ray as calcium spots, so women are discouraged from applying them on the day of their exam. There are two types of mammogram studies: screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms. Screening mammograms, consisting of four standard X-ray images, are performed yearly on patients who present with no symptoms. Diagnostic mammograms are reserved for patients with breast symptoms (such as palpable lumps, breast pain, skin changes, nipple changes, or nipple discharge), as follow-up for probably benign findings (coded BI-RADS 3), or for further evaluation of abnormal findings seen on their screening mammograms. Diagnostic mammograms may also performed on patients with personal or family histories of breast cancer. Patients with breast implants and other stable benign surgical histories generally do not require diagnostic mammograms.

Until some years ago, mammography was typically performed with screen-film cassettes. Today, mammography is undergoing transition to digital detectors, known as digital mammography or Full Field Digital Mammography (FFDM). The first FFDM system was approved by the FDA in the U.S. in 2000. This progress is occurring some years later than in general radiology. This is due to several factors:
# The higher spatial resolution demands of mammography
# Significantly increased expense of the equipment
# Concern by the FDA that digital mammography equipment demonstrate that it is at least as good as screen-film mammography at detecting breast cancers without increasing dose or the number of women recalled for further evaluation.

As of March 1, 2010, 62% of facilities in the United States and its territories have at least one FFDM unit. (The FDA includes computed radiography units in this figure.)

Tomosynthesis, otherwise known as 3D mammography, was first introduced in clinical trials in 2008 and has been Medicare-approved in the United States since 2015. As of 2023, 3D mammography has become widely available in the US and has been shown to have improved sensitivity and specificity over 2D mammography.

Mammograms are either looked at by one (single reading) or two (double reading) trained professionals: these film readers are generally radiologists, but may also be radiographers, radiotherapists, or breast clinicians (non-radiologist physicians specializing in breast disease). 

Double reading significantly improves the sensitivity and specificity of the procedure, and is standard practice in the United Kingdom, but not in the United States as it is not reimbursed by Medicare or private health insurance. This is despite multiple trials showing increased accuracy of detection and improved patient outcomes for both morbidity and mortality when double reading is employed. Clinical decision support systems may be used with digital mammography (or digitized images from analogue mammography), but studies suggest these approaches do not significantly improve performance or provide only a small improvement.

=== Interpretation of results ===
==== BI-RADS ====
Stratification for breast cancer risk on a mammogram is based on a reporting system known as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), developed by the American College of Radiology in 1993. It has five general categories of findings: mass, asymmetry, architectural distortion, calcifications, and associated features.

The use of language with BI-RADS is extremely precise, with a limited set of permissible adjectives for lesion margins, shape and internal density, each of which carries a different prognostic significance. Margins of a lesion, for example, can only be described as &quot;circumscribed&quot;, &quot;obscured&quot;, &quot;micropapillary&quot;, &quot;indistinct&quot; or &quot;stellate&quot;. Similarly, shape can only be &quot;round&quot;, &quot;oval&quot; or &quot;irregular&quot;. Each of these agreed upon adjectives is referred to as a &quot;descriptor&quot; in the BI-RADS lexicon, with specific positive and negative predictive values for breast cancer with each word. Additionally, each BI-RADS category corresponds with a probability of cancer. This fastiduous attention to semantics with BI-RADS allows for standardization of cancer detection across different treatment centers and imaging modalities. 

After describing the findings, the radiologist provides a final assessment ranging from 0 to 6:

* BI-RADS 0 indicates an incomplete assessment which needs additional imaging.
* BI-RADS 1 &amp; 2 indicate a negative and benign screen mammogram respectively.
* BI-RADS 3 indicates probably benign.
* BI-RADS 4 indicates suspicious for malignancy.
* BI-RADS 5 indicates highly suggestive of malignancy.
* BI-RADS 6 is for biopsy-proven breast cancer.

BI-RADS 3, 4 and 5 assessments on screening mammograms require further investigation with a second &quot;diagnostic&quot; study. The latter is a more detailed mammogram that allows dedicated attention to the abnormal finding with additional maneuvers such as magnification, rolling of breast tissue or exaggerated positioning. There may also be imaging with ultrasound at this time, which carries its own parallel BI-RADS lexicon. Suspicious lesions are then biopsied with local anesthesia or proceed straight to surgery depending on their staging. Biopsy can be done with the help of x-rays or ultrasound, depending on which imaging modality shows the lesion best.

In the UK mammograms are scored on a scale from 1–5 (1 = normal, 2 = benign, 3 = indeterminate, 4 = suspicious of malignancy, 5 = malignant). Evidence suggests that accounting for genetic risk, factors improve breast cancer risk prediction.

==History==
As a medical procedure that induces ionizing radiation, the origin of mammography can be traced to the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen in 1895.

In 1913, German surgeon Albert Salomon performed a mammography study on 3,000 mastectomies, comparing X-rays of the breasts to the actual removed tissue, observing specifically microcalcifications. By doing so, he was able to establish the difference as seen on an X-ray image between cancerous and non-cancerous tumors in the breast. Salomon&#x27;s mammographs provided substantial information about the spread of tumors and their borders.

In 1930, American physician and radiologist Stafford L. Warren published &quot;A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast&quot;, a study where he produced stereoscopic X-rays images to track changes in breast tissue as a result of pregnancy and mastitis. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases.

As early as 1937, Jacob Gershon-Cohen developed a form a mammography for a diagnostic of breast cancer at earlier stages to improve survival rates. In 1949, Raul Leborgne sparked renewed enthusiasm for mammography by emphasizing the importance of technical proficiency in patient positioning and the adoption of specific radiological parameters. He played a pioneering role in elevating imaging quality while placing particular emphasis on distinguishing between benign and malignant calcifications. In the early 1950s, Uruguayan radiologist Raul Leborgne developed the breast compression technique to produce better quality images, and described the differences between benign and malign microcalcifications.

In 1956, Gershon-Cohen conducted clinical trails on over 1,000 asymptomatic women at the Albert Einstein Medical Center on his screening technique, and the same year, Robert Egan at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center combined a technique of low kVp with high mA and single emulsion films developed by Kodak to devise a method of screening mammography. He published these results in 1959 in a paper, subsequently vulgarized in a 1964 book called &quot;Mammography&quot;. The &quot;Egan technique&quot;, as it became known, enabled physicians to detect calcification in breast tissue; of the 245 breast cancers that were confirmed by biopsy among 1,000 patients, Egan and his colleagues at M.D. Anderson were able to identify 238 cases by using his method, 19 of which were in patients whose physical examinations had revealed no breast pathology.

Use of mammography as a screening technique spread clinically after a 1966 study demonstrating the impact of mammograms on mortality and treatment led by Philip Strax. This study, based in New York, was the first large-scale randomized controlled trial of mammography screening.

In 1985, László Tabár and colleagues documented findings from mammographic screening involving 134,867 women aged 40 to 79. Using a single mediolateral oblique image, they reported a 31% reduction in mortality. Dr. Tabár has since written many publications promoting mammography in the areas of epidemiology, screening, early diagnosis, and clinical-radiological-pathological correlation.

== Arguments against screening mammography ==
The use of mammography as a screening tool for the detection of early breast cancer in otherwise healthy women without symptoms is seen by some as controversial.

Keen and Keen indicated that repeated mammography starting at age fifty saves about 1.8 lives over 15 years for every 1,000 women screened. This result has to be weighed against the adverse effects of errors in diagnosis, over-treatment, and radiation exposure.

The Cochrane analysis of screening indicates that it is &quot;not clear whether screening does more good than harm&quot;. According to their analysis, 1 in 2,000 women will have her life prolonged by 10 years of screening, while 10 healthy women will undergo unnecessary breast cancer treatment. Additionally, 200 women will experience significant psychological stress due to false positive results.

The Cochrane Collaboration (2013) concluded after ten years that trials with adequate randomization did not find an effect of mammography screening on total cancer mortality, including breast cancer. The authors of this Cochrane review write: &quot;If we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and over-treatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2,000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings.&quot; The authors conclude that the time has come to re-assess whether universal mammography screening should be recommended for any age group. They state that universal screening may not be reasonable. The Nordic Cochrane Collection updated research in 2012 and stated that advances in diagnosis and treatment make mammography screening less effective today, rendering it &quot;no longer effective&quot;. They conclude that &quot;it therefore no longer seems reasonable to attend&quot; for breast cancer screening at any age, and warn of misleading information on the internet.

Newman posits that screening mammography does not reduce death overall, but causes significant harm by inflicting cancer scare and unnecessary surgical interventions. The Nordic Cochrane Collection notes that advances in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer may make breast cancer screening no longer effective in decreasing death from breast cancer, and therefore no longer recommend routine screening for healthy women as the risks might outweigh the benefits.

Of every 1,000 U.S. women who are screened, about 7% will be called back for a diagnostic session (although some studies estimate the number to be closer to 10% to 15%). About 10% of those who are called back will be referred for a biopsy. Of the 10% referred for biopsy, about 3.5% will have cancer and 6.5% will not. Of the 3.5% who have cancer, about 2 will have an early stage cancer that will be cured after treatment.

Mammography may also produce false negatives. Estimates of the numbers of cancers missed by mammography are usually around 20%. Reasons for not seeing the cancer include observer error, but more frequently it is because the cancer is hidden by other dense tissue in the breast, and even after retrospective review of the mammogram the cancer cannot be seen. Furthermore, one form of breast cancer, lobular cancer, has a growth pattern that produces shadows on the mammogram that are indistinguishable from normal breast tissue.

=== Mortality ===
The Cochrane Collaboration states that the best quality evidence does not demonstrate a reduction in mortality or a reduction in mortality from all types of cancer from screening mammography.

The Canadian Task Force found that for women ages 50 to 69, screening 720 women once every 2 to 3 years for 11 years would prevent one death from breast cancer. For women ages 40 to 49, 2,100 women would need to be screened at the same frequency and period to prevent a single death from breast cancer.

Women whose breast cancer was detected by screening mammography before the appearance of a lump or other symptoms commonly assume that the mammogram &quot;saved their lives&quot;. In practice, the vast majority of these women received no practical benefit from the mammogram. There are four categories of cancers found by mammography:
# Cancers that are so easily treated that a later detection would have produced the same rate of cure (women would have lived even without mammography).
# Cancers so aggressive that even early detection is too late to benefit the patient (women who die despite detection by mammography).
# Cancers that would have receded on their own or are so slow-growing that the woman would die of other causes before the cancer produced symptoms (mammography results in over-diagnosis and over-treatment of this class).
# A small number of breast cancers that are detected by screening mammography and whose treatment outcome improves as a result of earlier detection.

Only 3% to 13% of breast cancers detected by screening mammography will fall into this last category. Clinical trial data suggests that 1 woman per 1,000 healthy women screened over 10 years falls into this category. Screening mammography produces no benefit to any of the remaining 87% to 97% of women. The probability of a woman falling into any of the above four categories varies with age.

A 2016 review for the United States Preventive Services Task Force found that mammography was associated with an 8%-33% decrease in breast cancer mortality in different age groups, but that this decrease was not statistically significant at the age groups of 39–49 and 70–74. The same review found that mammography significantly decreased the risk of advanced cancer among women aged 50 and older by 38%, but among those aged 39 to 49 the risk reduction was a non-significant 2%. The USPSTF made their review based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCT) studying breast cancer in women between the ages of 40-49.

=== False positives ===
The goal of any screening procedure is to examine a large population of patients and find the small number most likely to have a serious condition. These patients are then referred for further, usually more invasive, testing. Thus a screening exam is not intended to be definitive; rather it is intended to have sufficient sensitivity to detect a useful proportion of cancers. The cost of higher sensitivity is a larger number of results that would be regarded as suspicious in patients without disease. This is true of mammography. The patients without disease who are called back for further testing from a screening session (about 7%) are sometimes referred to as &quot;false positives&quot;. There is a trade-off between the number of patients with disease found and the much larger number of patients without disease that must be re-screened.

Research shows that false-positive mammograms may affect women&#x27;s well-being and behavior. Some women who receive false-positive results may be more likely to return for routine screening or perform breast self-examinations more frequently. However, some women who receive false-positive results become anxious, worried, and distressed about the possibility of having breast cancer, feelings that can last for many years.

False positives also mean greater expense, both for the individual and for the screening program. Since follow-up screening is typically much more expensive than initial screening, more false positives (that must receive follow-up) means that fewer women may be screened for a given amount of money. Thus as sensitivity increases, a screening program will cost more or be confined to screening a smaller number of women.

=== Overdiagnosis ===
The central harm of mammographic breast cancer screening is overdiagnosis: the detection of abnormalities that meet the pathologic definition of cancer but will never progress to cause symptoms or death. Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a researcher at Dartmouth College, states that &quot;screen-detected breast and prostate cancer survivors are more likely to have been over-diagnosed than actually helped by the test.&quot; Estimates of overdiagnosis associated with mammography have ranged from 1% to 54%. In 2009, Peter C. Gotzsche and Karsten Juhl Jørgensen reviewed the literature and found that 1 in 3 cases of breast cancer detected in a population offered mammographic screening is over-diagnosed. In contrast, a 2012 panel convened by the national cancer director for England and Cancer Research UK concluded that 1 in 5 cases of breast cancer diagnosed among women who have undergone breast cancer screening are over-diagnosed. This means an over-diagnosis rate of 129 women per 10,000 invited to screening. A recent systematic review of 30 studies found that screening mammography for breast cancer among women aged 40 years and older was 12.6%.

=== False negatives ===
Mammograms also have a rate of missed tumors, or &quot;false negatives&quot;. Accurate data regarding the number of false negatives are very difficult to obtain because mastectomies cannot be performed on every woman who has had a mammogram to determine the false negative rate. Estimates of the false negative rate depend on close follow-up of a large number of patients for many years. This is difficult in practice because many women do not return for regular mammography making it impossible to know if they ever developed a cancer. In his book &quot;The Politics of Cancer&quot;, Dr. Samuel S. Epstein claims that in women ages 40 to 49, one in four cancers are missed at each mammography. Researchers have found that breast tissue is denser among younger women, making it difficult to detect tumors. For this reason, false negatives are twice as likely to occur in pre-menopausal mammograms (Prate). This is why the screening program in the UK does not start calling women for screening mammograms until age 50.

The importance of these missed cancers is not clear, particularly if the woman is getting yearly mammograms. Research on a closely related situation has shown that small cancers that are not acted upon immediately, but are observed over periods of several years, will have good outcomes. A group of 3,184 women had mammograms that were formally classified as &quot;probably benign&quot;. This classification is for patients who are not clearly normal but have some area of minor concern. This results not in the patient being biopsied, but rather in having early follow up mammography every six months for three years to determine whether there has been any change in status. Of these 3,184 women, 17 (0.5%) did have cancers. Most importantly, when the diagnosis was finally made, they were all still stage 0 or 1, the earliest stages. Five years after treatment, none of these 17 women had evidence of re-occurrence. Thus, small early cancers, even though not acted on immediately, were still reliably curable.

=== Cost-effectiveness ===
Breast cancer imposes a significant economic strain on communities, with the expense of treating stages three and four in the United States in 2017 amounting to approximately $127,000. While early diagnosis and screening methods are important in reducing the death rates, the cost-benefit of breast cancer screening using mammography has been unclear. A recent systematic review of three studies held in Spain, Denmark, and the United States from 2000-2019 found that digital mammography is not cost-beneficial for the healthcare system when compared to other screening methods. Therefore, increasing its frequency may cause higher costs on the healthcare system. While there may be a lack of evidence, it is suggested that digital mammography be performed every two years for ages over 50.

=== Arguments against the USPSTF recommendations ===
As the USPSTF recommendations are so influential, changing mammography screenings from 50 to 40 years of age has significant implications to public health. The major concerns regarding this update is whether breast cancer mortality has truly been increasing and if there is new evidence that the benefits of mammography are increasing.

According to National Vital Statistics System, mortality from breast cancer has been steadily decreasing in the United States from 2018 to 2021. There have also been no new randomized trials of screening mammography for women in their 40s since the previous USPSTF recommendation was made. In addition, the 8 most recent randomized trials for this age group revealed no significant effect. Instead, the USPSTF used statistical models to estimate what would happen if the starting age were lowered, assuming that screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality by 25%. This found that screening 1,000 women from 40–74 years of age, instead of 50-74, would cause 1-2 fewer breast cancer deaths per 1,000 women screened over a lifetime.

Approximately 75 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history of breast cancer or other factors that put them at high risk for developing the disease (so screening only high-risk women misses majority of cancers). An analysis by Hendrick and Helvie, published in the &quot;American Journal of Roentgenology&quot;, showed that if USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines were followed, approximately 6,500 additional women each year in the U.S. would die from breast cancer.

The largest (Hellquist et al) and longest running (Tabar et al) breast cancer screening studies in history re-confirmed that regular mammography screening cut breast cancer deaths by roughly a third in all women ages 40 and over (including women ages 40–49). This renders the USPSTF calculations off by half. They used a 15% mortality reduction to calculate how many women needed to be invited to be screened to save a life. With the now re-confirmed 29% (or up) figure, the number to be screened using the USPSTF formula is half of their estimate and well within what they considered acceptable by their formula.

== Society and culture ==

=== Attendance ===
Many factors affect how many people attend breast cancer screenings. For example, people from minority ethnic communities are also less likely to attend cancer screening. In the UK, women of South Asian heritage are the least likely to attend breast cancer screening. Research is still needed to identify specific barriers for the different South Asian communities. For example, a study showed that British-Pakistani women faced cultural and language barriers and were not aware that breast screening takes place in a female-only environment.

People with mental illnesses are also less likely to attend cancer screening appointments. In Northern Ireland women with mental health problems were shown to be less likely to attend screening for breast cancer, than women without. The lower attendance numbers remained the same even when marital status and social deprivation were taken into account.

==Regulation==
Mammography facilities in the United States and its territories (including military bases) are subject to the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA). The act requires annual inspections and accreditation every three years through an FDA-approved body. Facilities found deficient during the inspection or accreditation process can be barred from performing mammograms until corrective action has been verified or, in extreme cases, can be required to notify past patients that their exams were sub-standard and should not be relied upon.

At this time, MQSA applies only to traditional mammography and not to related scans, such as breast ultrasound, stereotactic breast biopsy, or breast MRI.

As of September 10, 2024, the MQSA requires that all patients be notified of their breast density (&quot;dense&quot; or &quot;not dense&quot;) in their mammogram reports.

== Research ==

=== Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms ===
Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) programs have been developed to utilize features from screening mammography images to predict breast cancer risk. A systematic review of 16 retrospective study designs comparing median maximum AUC found that artificial intelligence had a comparable or better accuracy (AUC = 0.72) of predicting breast cancer than clinical risk factors alone (AUC = 0.61), suggesting a transition from clinical risk factor-based to AI image-based risk models may lead to more accurate and personalized risk-based screening approaches.

Another study of 32 published papers involving 23,804 mammograms and various machine learning methods (CNN, ANN, and SVM) found promising results in the ability to assist clinicians in large-scale population-based breast cancer screening programs.

== Alternative examination methods ==
For patients who do not want to undergo mammography, MRI and also breast computed tomography (also called breast CT) offer a painless alternative. Whether the respective method is suitable depends on the clinical picture; it is decided by the physician.

<text>In materials science, superplasticity is a state in which solid crystalline material is deformed well beyond its usual breaking point, usually over about 400% during tensile deformation. Such a state is usually achieved at high homologous temperature. Examples of superplastic materials are some fine-grained metals and ceramics. Other non-crystalline materials (amorphous) such as silica glass (&quot;molten glass&quot;) and polymers also deform similarly, but are not called superplastic, because they are not crystalline; rather, their deformation is often described as Newtonian fluid. Superplastically deformed material gets thinner in a very uniform manner, rather than forming a &quot;neck&quot; (a local narrowing) that leads to fracture. Also, the formation of microvoids, which is another cause of early fracture, is inhibited.
Superplasticity must not be confused with superelasticity.

== Historical developments of superplasticity ==
Some evidence of superplastic-like flow in metals has been found in some artifacts, such as in Wootz steels in ancient India, even though superplasticity was first scientific recognition in the twentieth century in the report on 163% elongation in brass by Bengough in 1912. Later, Jenkins&#x27; higher elongation of 300% in Cd–Zn and Pb–Sn alloys in 1928. However, those works did not go further to set a new phenomenon of mechanical properties of materials. Until the work of Pearson was published in 1934, a significant elongation of 1950% was found in Pb–Sn eutectic alloy. It was easy to become the most extensive elongation report in scientific investigation at this time. There was no further interest in superplasticity in the Western World for more than 25 years after Pearson&#x27;s effort. Later, Bochvar and Sviderskaya continued superplasticity in the Soviet Union with many publications on Zn–Al alloys. A research institute focused on superplasticity, the Institute of Metals Superplasticity Problems, was established in 1985 in Ufa City, Russia. This institute has remained the only global institute to work exclusively to research in superplasticity. The interest in superplasticity rose in 1982 when the first major international conference on &#x27;Superplasticity in Structural Materials, edited by Paton and Hamilton, was held in San Diego. From there, numerous investigations have been published with considerable results. Superplasticity is now the background for superplastic deformation forming as an essential aerospace application technique. 

== Conditions ==
In metals and ceramics, requirements for it being superplastic include a fine grain size (less than approximately 10 micrometers) and an operating temperature that is often from above a half absolute melting point. Several studies have found superplasticity in coarse-grain materials. However, the scientific community has agreed the grain size threshold at 10 micrometers is the precondition for activating superplasticity. Generally, grain growth at high-temperature, therefore maintaining the fine grain size structure at homologous temperature, is the main challenge in superplasticity research. The typical microstructure strategy uses a fine dispersion of thermally stable particles, which pin the grain boundaries and maintain the fine grain structure at the high temperatures and existence of multiple phases required for superplastic deformation. The alloy&#x27;s most typical microstructure for superplasticity is eutectic or eutectoid structure, as found in Sn-Pb, or Zn-Alloy alloys. 
Those materials that meet these parameters must still have a strain rate sensitivity (a measurement of the way the stress on a material reacts to changes in strain rate) of &gt;0.3 to be considered superplastic. The ideal strain rate sensitivity is 0.5, typically found in micro duplex alloys.

== Mechanism ==
The mechanisms of superplasticity in metals are determined as the Grain Boundary Sliding (GBS). However, the grain boundary sliding (GBS) can lead to the stress concentration at the triple junction or the grain boundary of the hard phases. Therefore, the GBS in polycrystal structured materials must be accompanied by other accommodation processes such as diffusion or dislocation. The diffusion models proposed by Ashby and Verall explain a gradual change in grain shapes to maintain the compatibility between the grains during the deformation. The changes in grain shape are operated by diffusion. The grain boundary migrates to form an equiaxed shape with a new orientation compared to the original grains. The dislocation model is explained as the stress concentration by GBS will be relaxed by dislocation motion in the blocking grains. The dislocation piles up, and the climb would allow another dislocation to be emitted. The further detail in dislocation model is still under debate, with several proposed by Crossman and Ashby, Langdon, and Gifkins model.

== High strain Rate Superplasticity ==
In general, superplasticity often occurs at a slow strain rate, in order of 10−4 s−1, and can be energy-consuming. In addition, prolonged time exposed to high-operation temperature also degraded the mechanical properties of materials. There is a strong demand to increase the strain rate in superplastic deformation to the order of 10−2 s−1, called High strain Rate Superplasticity (HSRS). Increment of strain rate in superplastic deformation is generally achieved by reduction of grain size in the ultrafine range from 100 to less than 500 ums. Further grain refinement to nanocrystalline structure with grain size less than 100 nm is ineffective in raising the deformation rate or improving ductility. The most common grain refinement process for HSRS research uses Severe Plastic Deformation (SPD). SPD can fabricate exceptional grain refinement to the sub-micrometer or even the nanometer range. Among many SPD techniques, the two most widely used techniques are equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and high-pressure torsion (HPT). Besides producing the ultrafine grain size, these techniques also provide a high fraction of high-angle boundaries. These high-angle grain boundaries are a specific benefit to increase the strain rates of deformation. Of the importance of grain refinement processing to superplasticity research, ECAP and HPT have been devoted to mainstream positions in superplasticity studies in metals.

== Advantages of superplastic forming ==

The process offers a range of important benefits, from both the design and production aspects. To begin with there is the ability to form components with double curvature and smooth contours from single sheet in one operation, with exceptional dimensional accuracy and surface finish, and none of the &quot;spring back&quot; associated with cold forming techniques. Because only single surface tools are employed, lead times are short and prototyping is both rapid and easy, because a range of sheet alloy thicknesses can be tested on the same tool.

== Forming techniques ==

There are three forming techniques currently in use to exploit these advantages. The method chosen depends upon design and performance criteria such as size, shape, and alloy characteristics.

=== Cavity forming ===

A graphite-coated blank is put into a heated hydraulic press. Air pressure is then used to force the sheet into close contact with the mould. At the beginning, the blank is brought into contact with the die cavity, hindering the forming process by the blank/die interface friction. Thus, the contact areas divide the single bulge into a number of bulges, which are undergoing a free bulging process. The procedure allows the production of parts with relatively exact outer contours. This forming process is suitable for the manufacturing of parts with smooth, convex surfaces.

=== Bubble forming ===

A graphite coated blank is clamped over a &#x27;tray&#x27; containing a heated male mould. Air pressure forces the metal into close contact with the mould. The difference between this and the female forming process is that the mould is, as stated, male and the metal is forced over the protruding form. For the female forming the mould is female and the metal is forced into the cavity.
The tooling consists of two pressure Chambers and a counter punch, which is linearly displaceable. Similar to the cavity forming technology, at the process beginning, the firmly clamped blank is bulged by gas pressure.

The second phase of the process involves the material being formed over the punch surface by applying a pressure against the previous forming direction. Due to a better material use, which is caused by process conditions, blanks with a smaller initial thickness compared to cavity forming can be used. Thus, the bubble forming technology is particularly suitable for parts with high forming depths.

=== Diaphragm forming ===

A graphite coated blank is placed into a heated press. Air pressure is used to force the metal into a bubble shape before the male mold is pushed into the underside of the bubble to make an initial impression. Air pressure is then used from the other direction to final form the metal around the male mould. This process has long cycle times because the superplastic strain rates are low. Product also suffers from poor creep performance due to the small grain sizes and there can be cavitation porosity in some alloys. Surface texture is generally good however. With dedicated tooling, dies and machines are costly. The main advantage of the process is that it can be used to produce large complex components in one operation. This can be useful for keeping the mass down and avoiding the need for assembly work, a particular advantage for aerospace products. For example, the diaphragm-forming method (DFM) can be used to reduce the tensile flow stress generated in a specific alloy matrix composite during deformation.

== Aluminium and aluminium based alloys ==

Superplastically formed (SPF) aluminium alloys have the ability to be stretched to several times their original size without failure when heated to between 470 and 520 °C. These dilute alloys containing zirconium, later known by the trade name SUPRAL, were heavily cold worked to sheet and dynamically crystallized to a fine stable grain size, typically 4–5 μm, during the initial stages of hot deformation. Also superplastic forming is a net-shape processing technology that dramatically decreases fabrication and assembly costs by reducing the number of parts and the assembly requirements. Using SPF technology, it was anticipated that a 50% manufacturing cost reduction can be achieved for many aircraft assemblies, such as the nose cone and nose barrel assemblies. Other spin-offs include weight reduction, elimination of thousands of fasteners, elimination of complex featuring and a significant reduction in the number of parts. The breakthrough for superplastic Al-Cu alloys was made by Stowell, Watts and Grimes in 1969 when the first of several dilute aluminium alloys (Al-6% Cu-0.5%Zr) was rendered superplastic with the introduction of relatively high levels of zirconium in solution using specialized casting techniques and subsequent electrical treatment to create extremely fine precipitates.

=== Commercial alloys ===

Some commercial alloys have been thermo-mechanically processed to develop superplasticity. The main effort has been on the Al 7000 series alloys, Al-Li alloys, Al-based metal-matrix composites, and mechanically alloyed materials.

=== Aluminium alloy composites ===
Aluminium alloy and its composites have wide applications in automotive industries. At room temperature, composites usually have higher strength compared to its component alloy. At high temperature, aluminium alloy reinforced by particles or whiskers such as , , and SiC can have tensile elongation more than 700%. The composites are often fabricated by powder metallurgy to ensure fine grain sizes and the good dispersion of reinforcements. The grain size that allows the optimal superplastic deformation to happen is usually 0.5~1 μm, less than the requirement of conventional superplasticity. Just like other superplastic materials, the strain rate sensitivity m is larger than 0.3, indicating good resistance against local necking phenomenon. A few aluminium alloy composites such as 6061 series and 2024 series have shown high strain rate superplasticity, which happens in a much higher strain rate regime than other superplastic materials. This property makes aluminium alloy composites potentially suitable for superplastic forming because the whole process can be done in a short time, saving time and energy.

==== Deformation mechanism for aluminium alloy composites ====
The most common deformation mechanism in aluminium alloy composites is grain boundary sliding (GBS), which is often accompanied by atom/dislocation diffusion to accommodate deformation. The GBS mechanism model predicts a strain rate sensitivity of 0.3, which agrees with most of the superplastic aluminium alloy composites. Grain boundary sliding requires the rotation or migration of very fine grains at relatively high temperature. Therefore, the refinement of grain size and the prevention of grain growth at high temperature is of importance.

The very high temperature (close to melting point) is also said to be related to another mechanism, interfacial sliding, because at high temperatures, partial liquids appear in the matrix. The viscosity of the liquid plays the main role to accommodate the sliding of adjacent grain boundaries. The cavitation and stress concentration caused by the addition of second phase reinforcements are inhibited by the flow of liquid phase. However, too much liquid leads to voids thus deteriorating the stability of the materials. So temperature close to but not exceeding too much the initial melting point is often the optimal temperature. The partial melting could lead to the formation of filaments at the fracture surface, which can be observed under scanning electron microscope. The morphology and chemistry of reinforcements also have influence on the superplasticity of some composites. But no single criterion has yet been proposed to predict their influences.

==== Methods to improve superplasticity ====
A few ways have been suggested to optimize the superplastic deformation of aluminium alloy composites, which are also indicative for other materials:

# Good dispersion of reinforcements. This is also important for room-temperature performance. 
# Refine the grain size of the matrix. The refinement creates more grains that can slide over each other at high temperature, facilitating the grain boundary sliding mechanism. This also implies a higher optimal strain rate. The trend of increase in strain rate has been observed in materials of finer grain sizes. Severe plastic deformation like equal-channel angular pressing has been reported to be able to achieve ultra-fine grained materials.
# Appropriately choosing the temperature and the strain rate. Some composites have to be heated close to melting, which might have opposite effects on other composites.

== Titanium and titanium based alloys ==

In the aerospace industry, Titanium alloys such as Ti–6Al–4V find extensive use in aerospace applications, not only because of their specific high temperature strength, but also because a large number of these alloys exhibit superplastic behavior. Superplastic sheet thermoforming has been identified as a standard processing route for the production of complex shapes, especially and are amenable to superplastic forming (SPF). However, in these alloys the additions of vanadium make them considerably expensive and so, there is a need for developing superplastic titanium alloys with cheaper alloying additions. The Ti-Al-Mn alloy could be such a candidate material. This alloy shows significant post-uniform deformation at ambient and near-ambient temperatures.

=== Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy ===

Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy is currently being used for aero engine components as well as other aerospace applications by forming through a conventional route that is typically cost, labour and equipment intensive. The Ti-Al-Mn alloy is a candidate material for aerospace applications. However, there is virtually little or no information available on its superplastic forming behaviour. In this study, the high temperature superplastic bulge forming of the alloy was studied and the superplastic forming capabilities are demonstrated.

=== The bulging process ===

The gas pressure bulging of metal sheets has become an important forming method. As the bulging process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. Many studies were made to obtain the dome height with respect to the forming time useful to the process designer for the selection of initial blank thickness as well as non-uniform thinning in the dome after forming.

=== Case study ===

The Ti-Al-Mn (OT4-1) alloy was available in the form of a 1 mm thick cold-rolled sheet. The chemical composition of the alloy. A 35-ton hydraulic press was used for the superplastic bulge forming of a hemisphere. A die set-up was fabricated and assembled with the piping system enabling not only the inert gas flushing of the die- assembly prior to forming, but also for the forming of components under reverse pressure, if needed. The schematic diagram of the superplastic forming set-up used for bulge forming with all necessary attachments and the photograph of the top (left) and bottom (right) die for SPF.

A circular sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was cut from the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank was placed on the die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), fitted at the bottom of the die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 °C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 °C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa. As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and thinning factor. Post deformation micro-structural studies were conducted on the formed components in order to analyze the microstructure in terms of grain growth, grain elongation, cavitations, etc.

==== Results and discussions ====

The microstructure of the as-received material with a two-dimensional grain size of 14 μm is shown in Fig. 8. The grain size was determined using the linear intercept method in both the longitudinal and transverse directions of the rolled sheet.

Successful superplastic forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K and argon gas forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 MPa. A maximum time limit of 250 minutes was given for the complete forming of the hemispheres. This cut-off time of 250 minutes was given for practical reasons. Fig. 9 shows a photo-graph of the blank (specimen) and a bulge formed component (temperature of 1123 K and a forming gas pressure of 0.6 MPa).

The forming times of successfully formed components at different forming temperatures and pressures. From the travel of the LVDT fitted at the bottom of the die (which measured the bulge height/depth) an estimate of the rate of forming was obtained. It was seen that the rate of forming was rapid initially and decreased gradually for all the temperature and pressure ranges as reported in Table 2. At a particular temperature, the forming time reduced as the forming pressure was increased. Similarly at a given forming pressure, forming time decreased with an increase in temperature.

The thickness of the bulge profile was measured at 7 points including the periphery (base) and pole. These points were selected by taking the line between centre of the hemisphere and base point as reference and offsetting by 15° until the pole point was reached. Hence the points 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 subtend an angle of 15°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 75° respectively with the base of the hemisphere as shown in Fig. 10. The thickness was measured at each of these points on the bulge profile by using an ultrasonic technique. The thickness values for each of the successfully formed hemispherical components.

Fig. 11 shows the pole thickness of fully formed hemispheres as a function of forming pressure at different temperatures. At a particular temperature the pole thickness reduced as the forming pressure was increased. For all the cases studied the pole thickness lay in the range of about 0.3 to 0.4 mm from the original blank thickness of 1 mm.

The thickness strain formula_1, where formula_2 is the local thickness and formula_3 is the initial thickness, was calculated at different locations for all the successfully formed components. For a particular pressure the thickness strain reduced as the forming temperature was increased. Fig. 12 shows the thickness strain, formula_1 as a function of position along the dome cross section in case of a component formed at 1123 K at a forming pressure of 0.6 MPa.

The post-formed microstructure revealed that there was no significant change in grain size. Fig. 13 shows the microstructure of the bulge formed component at the base and the pole for a component formed at a temperature of 1148 K and forming pressure of 0.6 MPa. These microstructures show no significant change in grain size.

==== Conclusion ====

The high temperature deformation behaviour and superplastic forming capability of a Ti-Al-Mn alloy was studied. Successful forming of 90 mm diameter hemispheres using the superplastic route were carried out at the temperature range of 1098 to 1223 K and forming pressure range of 0.2 to 0.8 MPa. The following conclusions could be drawn:
# The forming time decreased steeply when the gas pressure or temperature was increased. The rate of forming was initially high, but reduced progressively with time.
# At a particular temperature the pole thickness reduced as the forming pressure was increased. For all the cases studied the pole thickness lay in the range of about 0.3 to 0.4 mm from the original blank thickness of 1.0 mm.
# The thinning factor and thickness strain increased as one moved from the periphery to the pole. The post-formed microstructures show no significant change in grain size.

== Iron and steel ==

Mostly on non-qualified materials, such as austenitic steel of the Fe-Mn-Al alloy, which has some of the specific material parameters closely related to microstructural mechanisms. These parameters are used as indicators of material superplastic potentiality. The material was submitted to hot tensile testing, within a temperature range from 600 °C to 1000 °C and strain-rates varying from 10−6 to 1 s−1. The strain rate sensitivity parameter (m) and observed maximum elongation until rupture (εr) could be determined and also obtained from the hot tensile test.

=== Fe with Mn and Al alloys ===

The experiments stated a possibility of superplastic behaviour in a Fe-Mn-Al alloy within a temperature range from 700 °C to 900 °C with grain size around 3 μm (ASTM grain size 12) and average strain rate sensitivity of m ~ 0.54, as well as a maximum elongation at rupture around 600%.

=== Fe with Al and Ti alloys ===

The superplastic behaviour of Fe-28Al, Fe-28Al-2Ti and Fe-28Al-4Ti alloys has been investigated by tensile testing, optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Tensile tests were performed at 700–900 °C under a strain rate range of about 10−5 to 10−2/s. The maximum strain rate sensitivity index m was found to be 0.5 and the largest elongation reached 620%. In Fe3Al and Fe Al alloys with grain sizes of 100 to 600μm exhibit all deformation characteristics of conventional fine grain size superplastic alloys.

However, superplastic behaviour was found in large-grained iron aluminides without the usual requisites for superplasticity of a fine grain size and grain boundary sliding. Metallographic examinations have shown that the average grain size of large-grained iron aluminides decreased during superplastic deformation.

== Ceramics ==

=== The properties of ceramics ===

The properties of ceramic materials, like all materials, are dictated by the types of atoms present, the types of bonding between the atoms, and the way the atoms are packed together. This is known as the atomic scale structure. Most ceramics are made up of two or more elements. This is called a compound. For example, alumina (), is a compound made up of aluminium atoms and oxygen atoms.

The atoms in ceramic materials are held together by a chemical bond. The two most common chemical bonds for ceramic materials are covalent and ionic. For metals, the chemical bond is called the metallic bond. The bonding of atoms together is much stronger in covalent and ionic bonding than in metallic. That is why, generally speaking, metals are ductile and ceramics are brittle. Due to ceramic materials wide range of properties, they are used for a multitude of applications. In general, most ceramics are:
* hard
* wear-resistant
* brittle
* refractory
* thermal insulators
* electrical insulator
* nonmagnetic
* oxidation resistant
* prone to thermal shock
* good chemical stability

High-strain-rate superplasticity has been observed in aluminium-based and magnesium-based alloys. But for ceramic materials, superplastic deformation has been restricted to low strain rates for most oxides, and nitrides with the presence of cavities leading to premature failure. Here we show that a composite ceramic material consisting of tetragonal zirconium oxide, magnesium aluminates spinal and alpha-alumina phase exhibit superplasticity at strain rates up to 1.0 s−1. The composite also exhibits a large tensile elongation, exceeding 1050% or a strain rate of 0.4 s−1.
Superplastic metals and ceramics have the ability to deform over 100% without fracturing, permitting net-shape forming at high temperatures. These intriguing materials deform primarily by grain boundary sliding, a process accelerated with a fine grain size. However, most ceramics that start with a fine grain size experience rapid grain growth during high temperature deformation, rendering them unsuitable for extended superplastic forming. One can limit grain growth using a minor second phase (Zener pinning) or by making a ceramic with three phases, where grain to grain contact of the same phase is minimized. A research on fine grain three phase alumina-mullite()-zirconia, with approximately equal volume fractions of the three phases, demonstrates that superplastic strain rates as high as 10−2/sec at 1500 °C can be reached. These high strain rates put ceramic superplastic forming into the realm of commercial feasibility.

=== Cavitations ===

Superplastic forming will only work if cavitations don&#x27;t occur during grain boundary sliding, those cavitations leaving either diffusion accommodation or dislocation generation as mechanisms for accommodating grain boundary sliding. The applied stresses during ceramic superplastic forming are moderate, usually 20–50 MPa, usually not high enough to generate dislocations in single crystals, so that should rule out dislocation accommodation. Some unusual and unique features of these three phase superplastic ceramics will be revealed, however, indicating that superplastic ceramics may have a lot more in common with metals than previously thought.

=== Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline ===

Yttrium oxide is used as the stabilizer. This material is predominantly tetragonal in structure. Y-TZP has the highest flexural strength of all the zirconia based materials. The fine grain size of Y-TZP lends itself to be used in cutting tools where a very sharp edge can be achieved and maintained due to its high wear resistance. It is considered to be the first true polycrystalline ceramic shown to be superplastic with a 3-mol %
Y-TZP (3Y-TZP), which is now considered to be the model ceramic system.
The fine grade size leads to a very dense, non-porous ceramic with excellent mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, impact toughness, thermal shock resistance and very low thermal conductivity. Due to its characteristics Y-TZP is used in wear parts, cutting tools and thermal barrier coatings.

=== Grain size ===

Superplastic properties of 3Y-TZP is greatly affected by grain size as displaced in Fig. 3, elongation to failure decreases and flow strength increases while grain size increases. A study was made on the dependence of flow stress on grain size, the result –in summary- shows that the flow stress approximately depends on the grain size squared:
:formula_5

Where:
:formula_6 is the flow stress.
:d is the instantaneous grain size.

== Alumina () ==

Alumina is probably one of the most widely used structural ceramics, but superplasticity is difficult to obtain in alumina, as a result of rapid anisotropic grain growth during high-temperature deformation.
Regardless of which, several studies have been performed on superplasticity in doped, fine-grain .Demonstrated that the grain size of containing 500-ppm MgO can be further refined by adding various dopants, such as , , and . A grain size of about 0.66 μm was obtained in a 500-ppm -doped . As a result of this fine grain size, the exhibits a rupture elongation of 65% at 1450 °C under an applied stress of 20 MPa.

<text>Khaosai Galaxy (, born, 15 May 1959) is a Thai former professional boxer and Muay Thai fighter who competed between 1980 and 1991. He held the WBA super-flyweight title between November 1984 and December 1991. He is listed #19 on &quot;Ring&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time and named him the 43rd greatest fighter of the past 80 years in 2002. As of 2022, BoxRec rates him as the best Thai boxer of all time, pound for pound.

==Muay Thai career==
Khaosai was born as Sura Saenkham () in Phetchabun Province, Northern Thailand. He was a Muay Thai fighter in the early 1980s, and took the professional name Galaxy from a restaurant and nightclub owned by his manager&#x27;s friend. Khaosai had tremendous punching power, particularly in his soon-to-be legendary left hand. On the advice of his manager and trainer, he switched to Marquis of Queensbury style and began training as a western style boxer.

In Muay Thai his ring names were Daoden Muangsithep () and Khaosai Wangchomphu. ()

He credited his mother as the first trainer, because she was fond of boxing and Muay Thai. Due to he and his twin brother Khaokor Galaxy were born during the time that Pone Kingpetch, the first Thai world champion, was becoming famous.

His mother would wake them up at 4.00 a.m. for a run before school, along with supporting everything for the twins to fight. Unfortunately, she died before he became world champion.

==Boxing style==
Lacking the amateur boxing experience common to most Western professional boxers, Khaosai&#x27;s skills originally were limited, and he relied on toughness and his fearsome punching power to win. His southpaw style was based on closing his opponent and firing his left hand whenever he saw an opening. His right hand was used mainly to judge the distance for his left.

As he gained experience, Khaosai began to develop into a more refined boxer, learning combination punching to complement his deadly left. His favorite punch, a straight left to the midsection, translates roughly as &quot;the left hand that drills intestines.&quot;
Incredibly strong, he was never out-muscled, while opponents who tried the traditional stick-and-move techniques found he had quick feet and was able to block their movements.

==Professional boxing career==
Khaosai began his international style boxing career in December 1980. He won all of his first six fights, which earned him a shot at the Thailand bantamweight (118-pound) title on 1981 against Sakda Saksuree. He lost on a points decision. It was to be the last fight he would ever lose in the ring.

Khaosai won his next three fights and claimed the Thai bantamweight title in 1982. He won 15 consecutive fights by knockout and climbed in the world rankings to become super-flyweight WBA world champion Jiro Watanabe&#x27;s mandatory challenger by the summer of 1984.

When Watanabe failed to defend his title against Khaosai, the WBA stripped him and matched Khaosai against undefeated Eusebio Espinal for the vacant championship on 1984. Khaosai knocked out Espinal in the sixth round, beginning the longest title reign in his division&#x27;s history.

Khaosai defended his WBA title 19 times over the next seven years, winning 16 of his title fights by knockouts. In the mid-1980s, when world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson was in his prime and scoring knockouts over everyone, boxing fans nicknamed Khaosai &quot;The Thai Tyson&quot; for knockout wins.

Khaosai fought only once outside of Asia, when he defended his title in 1986 against unbeaten (and future WBA bantamweight titleholder) Israel Contreras in Curaçao. He had two title fights in Kōbe, Japan, one in South Korea and one at Bung Karno Stadium, Indonesia. The rest were in Thailand, where he often fought for purses in excess of $100,000 in front of huge crowds. That, plus the fact that few top fighters anywhere were willing to challenge Khaosai, made him relatively unknown in the West.

In 1988, his twin younger brother, fighting under the name Kaokhor Galaxy, captured the WBA bantamweight title, making the Galaxy brothers (Saenkham brothers) the first twins to ever be world boxing champions.
==Retirement==
He fought for the last time on December 22, 1991 in Bangkok, beating Armando Castro over 12 rounds. A few weeks later, he announced his retirement with a record of 47 wins against only one defeat, and never attempted a comeback.

==Life after boxing==
Not long after his retirement to the boxing profession, Khaosai chose to take part in the Thai entertainment industry. He first took a shot at the music industry, releasing a single, &quot;Khob Khun Krub&quot;, meaning &quot;Thank You&quot;, then began taking part in TV series and movies, particularly comedies. His first role as an actor occurred during the TV series &quot;Poot Mae Nam Khong&quot; (1992 version), which was then followed by &quot;Mon Rak Luk Thung&quot; (1995 version), &quot;The Legend of Suriyothai&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; (2004) etc. In 2005, while he was taking part in a film, he was punched in the face by a drunken fan, who wished to obtain Khaosai&#x27;s shirt for collection but was denied. The incident made frontline news, which displayed a photo of Khaosai, with a bandage on his face but smiling and standing next to the drunk man.

In 2006, he starred in a music video for a song by fellow boxers Somluck Kamsing and Samart Payakaroon. In the video, Khaosai portrayed a shy man being approached by a young woman.

After retirement, he married the Japanese Yumiko Ota, whose he had met during a trip for his second fight with Kenji Matsumura in Kōbe, Japan in 1989. The couple lived together for only one year, and later divorced.

He later married a Buriram woman, Sureerat &quot;Fah&quot; Saenkham (née Niwesram). They had no children together, but Khaosai chose to take his wife&#x27;s nephew as a stepchild.

In March 2013, he made news again when he unexpectedly was married again, this time to Wannapa &quot;Nung&quot; Kamboonsri, before obtaining a legal divorce from his previous wife. The same year, he became a father for the first time at the age of 54, when his wife safely delivered a daughter. In 2016, his wife delivered a second daughter by the end of the year.

Currently, he owns two Muay Thai gyms, one located in Bangkok and another in Phuket. He was a trainer for Denkaosan Kaovichit in the fight against Takefumi Sakata which took place by the end of 2008 in Yokohama, Japan. (Denkaosan knocked his opponent out by the second round, becoming the next WBA flyweight champion).

Besides boxing and entertainment, Khaosai has also flirted with politics. During the 2007 Thai general election, he was a candidate in the party-list of the Puea Pandin Party, but lost. Additionally, during the 2011 Thai general election, he became a candidate on behalf of the Chartthaipattana Party for his native Phetchabun 2nd district, but lost with only 8,485 votes.

==Legacy==
He was selected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1999 and remains a well known boxer throughout Thailand.

Every time he fought, there was a saying that traffic in Bangkok was good, because everyone rushed home to see him on TV.

<doc id="262047" wikidata="Q956565" url="?curid=262047" title="Stolin">
<text>Stolin (; ; ; ; ) is a town in Brest Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Stolin District, the largest district in the region. Stolin is located from the Belarus–Ukraine border. As of 2024, it has a population of 13,785.

Stolin is a border city that hosts many Ukrainians on market days. Russian is spoken commonly here, but villagers prefer their own dialects that are akin partly to the Belarusian language, partly the Ukrainian language.

==History==

Stolin is located at the heart of the Polesia region on the Horyn River, at the crossroads of two important routes, one leading northwards to Pinsk, two others eastwards to Davyd-Haradok and Turov, that are now in Belarus, southwards to Sarny and Kyiv, that are now in Ukraine.

Archaeological evidence suggests that the area which Stolin now occupies, was settled as far back as the 12th century AD. The first mention of Stolin dates to 1555. There are three stories regarding the origins of the name &quot;Stolin&quot;. The first refers to a group of local fisherman who cast their fishing nets into a lake a pulled out 100 fish or Sto [100 in &quot;Russian&quot;] &quot;Leeni&quot; [a type of local fish]. The second story refers to a ferry-boat which sunk in the river and required 100 men with 100 ropes to drag it out [100 lines in &quot;Russian&quot;]. The third refers to twelve brothers who ruled over seven nearby cities and chose what became Stolin as their meeting place and capital city, hence the name may be a derivation of stol (table)&gt; Stolny Gorod (capital city).

Stolin was occupied by the Germans from July 1941 to 1944. In August 1941, many Jewish refugees – especially women and children – from the nearby town of David-Gorodok came to Stolin. A ghetto was created in May 1942, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. About 7,000 Jews lived in this small and unhealthy area, along the Bank River. The liquidation of the ghetto was conducted on September 11, 1942, by a squadron of German cavalry, the local police and the SD. The shooting took place near the airfield, in a large ditch.

==International relations==
Stolin is twinned with:
