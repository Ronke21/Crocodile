<text>Corning is a city in Steuben County, New York, United States, on the Chemung River. The population was 10,551 at the 2020 census. It is named for Erastus Corning, an Albany financier and railroad executive who was an investor in the company that developed the community. The city is best known as the headquarters of Fortune 500 company Corning Incorporated, formerly Corning Glass Works, a manufacturer of glass and ceramic products for industrial, scientific and technical uses. Corning is roughly equidistant from New York City and Toronto, being about from both.

== Overview ==

The city of Corning is situated at the western edge of the town of Corning and in the southeast part of Steuben County.

It is also home to the Corning Museum of Glass, which houses one of the world&#x27;s most comprehensive collections of glass objects from antiquity to the present. The museum houses the Rakow Library, one of the world&#x27;s major glass research centers.

The city&#x27;s other major cultural attraction is the Rockwell Museum. It contains an important collection of Western American painting and sculpture assembled over the past 40 years by Robert F. and Hertha Rockwell. The city has been cited several times by &quot;American Style&quot; magazine as one of the top twenty-five small city arts destinations in the U.S. – most recently in June 2010. Many of the cultural events and historic landmarks in the city are in Corning&#x27;s Gaffer District.

Corning Country Club annually hosted the Corning Classic, a stop on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, from 1979 to 2009. The city has commercial air service available at Elmira/Corning Regional Airport in the nearby town of Big Flats.

Corning is also home to the 2006 New York State Class A high school football champions.

In 2006, the city council approved public water fluoridation. In 2007, a petition was launched to ban this practice by local resident Kirk Huttleston which eventually became known as Proposition 1. Proposition 1 passed the ban by a close vote of 1,287 to 1,222, according to unofficial results, leading to a full ban on public water fluoridation in 2008.

In 2013, Rand McNally&#x27;s list of best small towns in America named Corning the &quot;Most Fun&quot; town out of all the list&#x27;s finalists.

== History ==

The first settlement in the town of Corning was made near the site of the future city in 1796. The community was incorporated as a village in 1848. Corning was incorporated as a city in 1890. As the glass industry developed, Corning became known as the &quot;Crystal City&quot; which was supported by companies such as Hawkes, Sinclair, and Hunt - which produced some of the finest American Brilliant Period cut glass between 1880 and 1915.

The Corning area&#x27;s first real industry was lumber. The first settlers used the area&#x27;s river systems to transport logs and finished lumber in fleets downstream to buyers. This gave rise to large mills which helped to develop the area. Rafting of lumber began to wane as timber was depleted. At one time the mills of the Corning area were reputed to be among the biggest in the world. After the lumber was depleted the great mills moved north to new forests.

East, across the Chemung River from Corning, lies Gibson, the site of a feeder canal for the Chemung Canal system. Some of Corning&#x27;s early prosperity came from the feeder canal system exposure. Canal cargoes from Corning included soft coal, timber, tobacco, grain, and whiskey. From April 22 to December 11, 1850, the canal season that year, the newspaper reported that 1,116 boats left the port of Corning. Tolls for the year totaled $54,060.39. Among items shipped were 46,572,400 pounds of coal. The canal&#x27;s best peacetime year was 1854 when 270,978 tons of freight were hauled. The Civil War brought an abnormal amount of business, with a peak of 307,151 tons hauled in one year.

After the Civil War, an industrial boom occurred in the region. Ingersoll Rand opened during this period in Painted Post, just north of Corning.

Corning became a railroad town in the 1880s, many smaller railroad lines busily weaving webs of tracks connecting the major trunk line to smaller communities. In 1912, the Corning train wreck three miles east of Corning in Gibson left 39 dead.

The Jenning&#x27;s Tavern, Corning Armory, Market Street Historic District, Southside Historic District, World War Memorial Library, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===The flood of 1972===
The flood of 1972 was a major event for the area. On June 22, 1972, the storm that had been Hurricane Agnes struck the Southern Tier of New York. The storm combined with a storm system from Ohio to drop six to eight inches (203 mm) of rain in the Chemung River basin. This ultimately overwhelmed the flood control systems of the time, and the Chemung River broke through the dam system on Friday, June 23 at 4:00 a.m. By 9:00 a.m. the river crested and began to recede. In the Corning area, eighteen people were killed and untold millions of dollars of damage was incurred. The river receded within hours, leaving mud which can still be found in basements of homes and businesses in Corning, and there is a section of the Corning Museum of Glass that indicates on the wall how high the flood waters rose.

== Geography ==
Just upstream from Corning, the Cohocton River and the Tioga River merge to form the Chemung River which flows through downtown. The river was an important source of power in the early history, and is part of the attractiveness of the region today.

The river is prone to floods, as rain water runs off quickly from the steep hillsides of the area. In 1972 the remnants of Hurricane Agnes dropped fifteen or more inches of rain in the area within a short time causing extensive flooding. Eighteen people were killed in the immediate Corning-Painted Post area. The entire downtown area was flooded, with severe damage. Flooding is now controlled by a system of dams upstream from Corning.

I-86 (the Southern Tier Expressway), NY 17, NY 352, NY 414, and NY 415 are major highways connecting in Corning. County Road 40 leads into the city from the south and County Road 41 from the north. I-99 and US 15 proceeds southward from Painted Post, west of Corning.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.3 square miles (8.5 km2), of which, 3.1 square miles (8.1 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.4 km2) of it (5.18%) is water.

<text>Wayland is a village in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 1,865 at the 2010 census.

The Village of Wayland is in the northern part of the Town of Wayland, near the northern border of Steuben County.

== History ==

The village was incorporated in 1877. The village grew after it was selected as a station on the Erie Railroad.

==Geography==
Wayland is located at (42.568131, -77.591854).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.0 square mile (2.7 km2), all land.

Wayland is in the northwestern part of the county, near the border of Livingston County and just north of Interstate 390 at the junction of NY-15, NY-21 and NY-63. County Road 93 also leads into the village from the north.

Wayland is the northern terminal of the B&amp;H Rail Corporation&#x27;s Painted Post-to-Wayland railroad line: the surviving portion of the Delaware. Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad Main Line between Binghamton and Buffalo.

Wayland was formerly located on the New York City (Hoboken)-to-Buffalo Main Line of the Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western Railroad and on the New York City (Jersey City)-to-Rochester Main Line of the Erie Railroad. Both of these routes were abandoned and partially or fully-dismantled through Wayland by order of the United States Interstate Commerce Commission, upon application of the owning railroads. Upon the 1960 merger of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the Erie Railroad, the new Erie Lackawanna Railroad 
obtained the ability to abandon the Groveland-Wayland portion of its former DL&amp;W Buffalo-Hoboken, NJ mainline, thus eliminating a steep southbound (railroad east) grade that had operationally tormented the DL&amp;W for 81 years (since 1882). The EL rerouted its combined Buffalo-Hoboken operation to the Erie Buffalo-Hoboken mainline, via Hornell, when the former DL&amp;W track was lifted in 1963.

==Demographics==

<text>Wayland is a town in Steuben County, New York, United States. The population was 3,733 at the 2020 census.

The Town of Wayland contains a village called Wayland. The town is in the northern part of the county, northwest of Bath.

== History ==
The region was first settled by European Americans around 1806, after the Revolutionary War. In historic times, for centuries it had been territory inhabited by the Seneca Native Americans, one of the powerful five tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy.

The town was formed in 1848 from the Towns of Cohocton and Dansville. Part of Wayland was used to form the Town of Fremont in 1854.

The Rowe House is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

On August 30, 1943, the Lackawanna Limited wreck, occurred when the &quot;Lackawanna Limited&quot;, flagship passenger train of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad sideswiped a local freight that had not cleared into a siding, killing 29 people near the Gunlocke chair factory.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 39.5 square miles (102.4 km2), of which 39.0 square miles (101.1 km2) is land and 0.5 square mile (1.3 km2) (1.31%) is water.

The northern and part of the western town lines form the border of Livingston County.

New York State Route 21 is a north-south highway in the town and intersects New York State Route 15 and New York State Route 63 in the village of Wayland. Interstate 390 crosses the town from west to east.

Wayland is the northern terminus of the B&amp;H Rail Corp.&#x27;s Gang Mills–Wayland Line. Prior to 1956, it was linked to Rochester directly by rail and, prior to 1964, it was directly linked to Buffalo by rail. Both of these connections were removed by order of the ICC following application by the owning railroads. As the Erie Lackawanna Railway&#x27;s former Lackawanna mainline from Buffalo had a steep grade eastbound from 
Groveland to Perkinsville that was easily bypassed by the former Erie mainline via Hornell, with far easier grades, the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad mainline trackage between Groveland and Wayland was abandoned and torn-up in late 1963.

The Woodcroftery factory, which made wooden bowls and other wooden items, was located at Park St. and 2nd Ave.

<doc id="260080" wikidata="Q3461796" url="?curid=260080" title="Babylon (village), New York">
<text>Babylon is a village within the Town of Babylon in Suffolk County, New York. The population was 12,188 at the 2020 census. It is located approximately from New York City at the Queens border and approximately from Manhattan.

Its official name is The Incorporated Village of Babylon. It is commonly referred to as Babylon Village, to distinguish it from the Town of Babylon, of which it is a part.

==History==
What is now Babylon Town and Village was originally part of Huntington Town and known as Huntington South. Lightly settled from 1689, its main industry, in common with much of the area along Great South Bay and South Oyster Bay (both actually lagoons), was the harvesting of salt hay, which was used as cattle feed and bedding.

When a coherent community grew up in the area by 1803, prominent local citizens sought to adopt a new name. An influential local lady, Mrs. Conklin, was used to living inland in what is now considered Dix Hills and was at unease with the home site that her grandchildren would be raised in. The bible-reading Mrs. Conklin compared the new hamlet to the biblical city of &quot;Babylon&quot; and proposed that name in apparent defiance of the area&#x27;s rather bawdy reputation as a stop-over place for travelers on Long Island&#x27;s south shore. Her son Nat was appalled by the use of an &quot;unholy&quot; name. The family legend states she replied: &quot;But it will be a &quot;new&quot; Babylon.&quot; The name stuck, despite some effort to change it. The adjacent part of Islip, an effective extension of Babylon, was originally considered as part of Babylon, or as East Babylon, but today is the hamlet of West Islip.

===Revolutionary War through the War of 1812===
Babylon had already been settled, as Huntington South, prior to hostilities with the British in the Revolutionary War. The First Presbyterian Church of Islip and Huntington South, as it was then known, was established in 1730. Though the church would later be split into two separate Huntington South and Islip churches in 1857 (the former to be renamed the First Presbyterian Church of Babylon after 1872). However, long before this split, the First Presbyterian Church held services in the original wooden church until 1778 when British soldiers tore down the structure. The wood from the first church was taken west to Hempstead to construct a barracks for British troops. This event was more recent history when, on the eve of the War of 1812, Joshua Hartt gave an impassioned sermon encouraging the young men to defend the United States and prepare for a &quot;righteous war.&quot;

Babylon supplied several heroes of the Revolutionary war and War of 1812, some of whom, like continental soldier David Smith who served under George Washington, are buried in the old Babylon Cemetery. Perhaps most prominent was Joel Cook, a veteran of both wars. Citizens of Babylon first honored Captain Joel Cook with a monument unveiled in 1908. Captain Cook served throughout the duration of the Revolutionary War and commanded a Company in the War of 1812. Other prominent veterans of the War of 1812 include members of the Sammis and Cooper families. Both of these families are remembered by street names in the Village today.

In July 1814, survivors of the Battle of Valparaiso were led by Captain David Porter through the Fire Island Inlet (which would have been a very difficult task using simply oars) and up to Babylon via Sumpawams Creek. Villagers were shocked to see armed sailors heading into town, and it took time to convince some of the more prominent citizens that Captain Porter was not a British agent. To convince Stephen B. Nichols, Captain Porter even offered him his cutlass and proposed to surrender to him if Nichols truly felt he was the enemy. Once thoroughly convinced of his commission as a US naval officer, villagers provided Captain Porter and his men with a carriage and horses to take them to the Brooklyn Naval Yard. It was there that Captain Porter first shared the news of the fight at Valparaiso, over four months after the engagement.

===Hotels; gateway to Fire Island===
Babylon soon became the primary gateway to the nearby barrier beaches, including Fire Island, a position it held until the building of the current Captree Causeways allowing automobile access to the beaches nearest the Babylon shore. Beachgoers arriving by train or coach, or staying at local hotels typically took the Babylon Railroad, originally a horsecar line and later a trolley, to the Babylon Dock for ferries to Oak Island, Muncie Island, and Fire Island destinations.

As now, the epitome of the luxury lifestyle was summering on the ocean. This led many affluent individuals and families to reside at Babylon&#x27;s seaside resorts, both on the mainland and on barrier beach islands. Muncie Island, (was just north of Oak Beach, island was depleted for the construction of Ocean Parkway) was host to one of the most elite sanatoriums and nearby Saltaire was host to the Surf Hotel offering several hundred rooms to guests. Guests of the Surf would take the rail road to Babylon&#x27;s trolley and then cross the bay by a ferry. Off Robins Avenue at Stone Dock was the South Shore Inn and Watson House on Fire Island Avenue was famed to be &quot;L.I.&#x27;s most luxurious hotel&quot; when it was built. Those of even greater wealth would have homes or compounds built on the shore or barrier beach islands for vacationing. Stage stop hotels include the La Grange Inn, previously used as a catering hall, and now a West Islip Historical Museum, and is actually adjacent West Islip.

Some of Babylon&#x27;s hotels included:
* American Hotel, Main Street and Fire Island Avenue
* The Argyle, Argyle Park, Main Street
* Boynes Hotel, at steamboat dock
* East End Hotel, Main Street and Cooper Street (burned in 1982)
* La Grange Inn, South Country Road, (West Islip), ***NOW CLOSED***
* St. James West Main Street
* Sherman House, East Main Street
* South Shore Inn, Robbins Avenue
* Surf Hotel, Fire Island, east of the lighthouse
* Watson House, Fire Island Avenue

===Argyle Hotel &amp; Park===

The famous Argyle Hotel in Babylon was one of many built in the late 19th century to accommodate wealthy summer visitors from New York City. It was constructed in 1882 by August Belmont, the LIRR and resort entrepreneur on the former estate of Brooklyn railroad magnate Electus B. Litchfield. Financing was provided by a syndicate headed by Long Island Rail Road President, Austin Corbin. The grounds, which included a large millpond, Blythebourne Lake became renamed Argyle Lake, for one of the hotel&#x27;s largest investors and town aristocrat, the heir to the Dukedom of Argyll. The renaming gave the Hotel &amp; Park a more genteel English flavor yet the hotel proved a bad venture: it was near the end of the era of such projects, it was built much too large with 350 rooms, and so was rarely more than one-third filled. After about a decade of disuse, it was finally demolished in 1904, with some of the material from the structure being used to build homes west of the lake in the neighborhood now known as Argyle Park. In 1921, the land that is now the Argyle Park was donated for passive recreation to the Village of Babylon, by J. Stanley Foster, Esq. This park is still popular, drawing substantial numbers of visitors from outside the community for fishing, strolling, playing on the children&#x27;s playground, and winter ice skating (including a lighted area for night skating).

===Effingham Park/Hawley&#x27;s Lake Park===

Effingham Park was the site of the Old Mill on what is now the Babylon Village-West Islip border and South Country Road, now Montauk Highway (Main Street in Babylon). The old mill is claimed to be the first permanent structure in the Village area and was constructed for Judge Garrett Montfort and operated by the Oakley family for approximately 100 years. Nathaniel Conklin also owned the mill and in its final years, ownership was in the hands of David Ricketts, the second mayor of the Village. Ricketts used the mill as a toy whip factory which he later relocated to George Street. At one point, a bridge was used to carry Main Street over the overflows connection to Sumpwams Creek.

The park belonged to the estate of Effingham Sutton that later came into the ownership of Edwin Hawley, a U.S. railroad tycoon. Hawley demolished the Old Mill and parts of Sutton&#x27;s Estate to erect an even more opulent estate including guest cottages, staff housing, and stables. Hawley turned the overflow from the Old Mill into a waterfall that matched and, some claim, exceeded the splendor of the still-existent Argyle Falls at Argyle Memorial Park. In addition to the falls, there were two bridges crossing the north side and mid-northeast side of the lake in many old postcards and photographs. The north side bridge was likely the bridge that carried George Street over the stream feeding Hawley&#x27;s Pond, before New York Highway 231 was put through the area.

The Hawley Estate was gated off from the public with hedges and grand ornate estate fencing so that the public rarely saw its vast luxuries and amenities. In the late 1960s the site of Hawley&#x27;s Pond was in a rundown state, being unkempt and dilapidated. When Route 231 was being built, Hawley&#x27;s Lake Park lost all hope of being repaired and restored to its former glory: the routes northern and southern terminus were run directly through the estate. Some sources even claim that the lake was made considerably smaller and was partially filled in during the expressway&#x27;s construction. Today, Hawley&#x27;s Lake Park is an unused resource due mostly for its lack of parking and lack of village concern. The aging grand falls were replaced with a more modern, less ornate and less attractive setup. The Babylon Beautification Society tries from time to time to maintain the site, although no plan has proved considerably successful. Since there is no parking at the site, and because access to families that might otherwise want to use it is constrained by the necessity of crossing active highway lanes, the current status of the site has remained unchanged. Between the park and the Lake Drives in West Islip and the northern terminus of Route 231 is a small group of ponds also belonging to the former Effingham Park. This portion is no longer designated as park property, and is accessible to the homes on Lake Drive South and Lake Drive North. The overflow pool from Hawley&#x27;s Fall opens into two tunnels beneath Main Street that drain into Sumpawams River, known locally as East Creek, and eventually into Great South Bay.

===Baseball and African-American history===

Many of the black service personnel of the Argyle Hotel formed a baseball team, the Babylon Black Panthers, said to be the first black professional baseball team. The team so dominated local white teams that Walter Cook, a New Jersey promoter, put up the money to have them travel and play as the &quot;Cuban Giants.&quot; Calling black ballplayers (or ballplayers in &quot;white&quot; professional clubs in that era who seemed too dark to be Caucasian) &quot;Cuban&quot; was a common practice through World War II. There were no Cubans in the &quot;Cuban Giants&quot;.

The team went on to become the &quot;world colored champions&quot; of 1887 and 1888, and spawned imitators.

Babylon Village today has three baseball fields for the high school, little league and adult play, and the high school team is named the &quot;Babylon Panthers&quot;. The Babylon Panthers varsity baseball team won Long Island championships in 2005-2006, 2012, 2023 and the New York State championship in 2007. The village also has one of Long Island&#x27;s older continuous African-American communities, of which the employees of the Argyle are said to have formed the core. This community still maintains two of the village&#x27;s 12 churches, the &quot;Ebenezer Baptist Church&quot; and the &quot;Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church&quot;, both on Cooper Street.

Another prominent African-American, the film actress Thelma (Butterfly) McQueen, moved with her family from her birthplace of Tampa, Florida to live on Cottage Row in Babylon, where she went on to graduate from Babylon High School and then pursued her acting career before later attending several universities and attaining a degree in political science. Cottage Row still exists but no longer has any housing on it, falling prey to parking space for business district stores.

===Hurricane Sandy===
Many Babylon village residences and businesses suffered major flood and wind damage from Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012, with most of the damage occurring south of Montauk Highway (Main Street) close to the Great South Bay. This particular area experienced storm surge as high as twelve feet during the storm. Damage caused by Sandy displaced dozens of families in Babylon for several months and even years.
==Description==
Babylon today is part suburban bedroom community, part small-town, and has a substantial shopping and business district.

Today the village is best known for its restaurants and shops, and hosts shopping events during the fall as well as a popular crafts fair.

The non-profit James Street Players theatre group is one of the earliest on Long Island. Known best for bringing affordable live theater to Babylon Village since 1967.

A statue of Robert Moses was erected in front of the Village Hall on Main Street (Montauk Highway) in 2003.

===Housing stock and neighborhoods===

The commercial and housing stock in Babylon reflects its longevity as a community. Because of the 140-year presence of the railroad, and its earlier status as a way station on Montauk Highway, originally the only through highway on Long Island&#x27;s south shore, most of the core of Babylon dates to the era from before the American Civil War to World War I. As a result, there is a mix of building styles, including pre-Civil War, colonial, Victorian, and more recent designs. Nearer the shore, much of the housing was originally summer properties, including mansions and estates, cottages and bungalows: the latter two, virtually all now winterized. As far as large formal mansions and estates, most have been razed, yet one of the last remaining estates in Babylon, and presumably the towns smallest is the Long Island Yacht Club, built by E.W. Howell Co. of Babylon, NY in 1927 at a cost of $26.500.00.

Areas of large old homes and less formal mansions exist in a number of areas, including on Fire Island Avenue, Crescent Avenue and Thompson Avenue on Sumpawam&#x27;s Neck, the area in between West Creek (Carll&#x27;s River) and East Creek (Sumpawams River), the main body of the village between Main Street and the Bay.

Because of this history, and the general unavailability of large tracts of building land, Babylon Village has very few tract houses or developments. Some of the few areas developed after World War II reflected the conversion of remaining farms and remains of large estates and mansions. These areas generally contain 1950s-style ranch houses, but there are some characteristic Long Island split level homes and high ranches.

Areas of large new homes are on formerly undeveloped or reclaimed former wetlands developed during the late 1940s through 1970s, including on Lucinda and Peninsula Drives, with estate-like homes such as that of Bret Saberhagen until 2001. Most of the affluent homes built in these new areas were large ranch houses, popular in the time of building, but much less favored today. In the last decade and continuing to the present, many of these houses have been expanded by adding a story and changing their style to more colonial appearance.

Babylon Village has also experienced the modern phenomenon in which small sound houses on desirable lots have been purchased and torn down by affluent recent purchasers and replaced with houses as large as zoning will permit, meaning that the new home builder has paid the price of a home just to obtain the lot.

===Public schools===
Most of the residents of the Village of Babylon are served by the Babylon Union Free School District (UFSD). Since the school district lines are not coextensive with the village boundaries, as is common on Long Island, some residents of Babylon Village are in the West Babylon UFSD and, conversely, some residents of West Babylon go to the village schools, as well as residents of Oak Island, Oak Beach, Gilgo, West Gilgo, and Captree Island across the Great South Bay.

As of the 2010-2011 School Year, the Babylon Union Free School District had 1,788 students. The racial demographics were 0% Native American or Alaska Native, 4% non-Hispanic black or African-American, 8% Hispanic or Latino, 84% non-Hispanic white, 3% Asian or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander and 0% multiracial. 9% of students were eligible for free lunch, 3% for reduced-price lunch, and 1% of students were Limited English Proficient. 10.7% of students were classified as &quot;Special Ed&quot;.

The school district had a graduation rate of 94%, and 1% of students did not complete school. 96% of graduates received a Regents Diploma and 67% received a Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation. Of the 2011 completers, 75% planned to move on to 4-year College, 19% to 2-year College, 0% to Other Post-Secondary, 0% to the Military, 4% to Employment, 0% to Adult Services, 2% had other known post-secondary plans, and 0% had no known post-secondary plan.

The district currently has three schools:
* Babylon Elementary School, serves all students in grades K-2;
* Babylon Grade School, serves all students in grades 3-6. Both of these schools are on a single large campus running east from Ralph Avenue between Park Avenue and Beverly Road;
* Babylon Junior-Senior High School, serves grades 7 and up in the original, but modernized and expanded High School building on North Carll Avenue between South Railroad Avenue and Grove Place, opposite the Babylon Railroad Station.

Babylon Village children who live in the West Babylon School District (all of Babylon Village west of Route 109 and all of Little East Neck south of Cambridge Drive) are served by these schools:
* John F. Kennedy Elementary School &quot;or&quot; South Bay School, both on the same campus west of Great East Neck Road, grades K-5;
* West Babylon Junior High School, serves students in grades 6-8, located at Old Farmingdale Road and Little East Neck Road;
* West Babylon High School, serves students in grades 9-12, at the junction of Route 109 (Babylon-Farmingdale Road) and Great East Neck Road.

The poet Walt Whitman, forced to find work after the Great Fire of New York in 1835 devastated the printing and publishing industry, took work at a number of Long Island &quot;country schools.&quot; Among them was West Babylon&#x27;s school, located midway between Little East Neck and Great East Neck Roads, just west of the current village boundary, and now occupied by a supermarket, where he taught in the winter of 1836-37.

==Transportation==

Babylon is served by several transit options. The Babylon station is the terminal for the Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, and is also served by the Montauk Branch. Therefore, passengers utilizing the Babylon station can travel to both the westernmost and easternmost stations on Long Island, making the village ideal for commuters. The average weekday commute from Babylon station to New York City&#x27;s Penn Station ranges (roughly) from 55 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes, depending on train schedules and station stops.

The train station is also a hub for several buses run by Suffolk County Transit:

* 2: Amityville LIRR station - Patchogue LIRR station
* 3: Babylon LIRR station - Walt Whitman Shops
* 5: Babylon LIRR station - Smith Haven Mall
* 10: Amityville LIRR station - Babylon LIRR station
* 15: Babylon LIRR station - Robert Moses State Park (summer service only)

<text>The Village of East Hampton is a village in Suffolk County, New York. It is located in the town of East Hampton on the South Fork of eastern Long Island. The population was 1,083 at the time of the 2010 census, 251 less than in the year 2000. It is a center of the summer resort and upscale locality at the East End of Long Island known as The Hamptons and is generally considered one of the area&#x27;s two most prestigious communities. The Mayor of East Hampton Village is Jerry Larsen, elected on September 15, 2020.

== History ==
===17th century===

The village of Easthampton was founded in 1648 by Puritan farmers who worshipped as Presbyterians. The community was based on farming, with some fishing and whaling. Whales that washed up on the beach were butchered, and whales were hunted offshore with rowboats sometimes manned by Montauk Indians. The lack of a good harbor in East Hampton, however, resulted in Sag Harbor becoming a whaling center which sent ships to the Pacific.

The land had been purchased in 1648 by the governors of Connecticut Colony and New Haven Colony from the Montauk Indians, in large part for small drills to make wampum, their traditional industry; hunting and fishing rights were retained. It was then sold for about £30 to settlers, some from Lynn and Salem, Massachusetts, who had not found room for their herds in Massachusetts Bay Colony. The original name for the village was Maidstone, from a village in Kent where some of the settlers may have originated. Each original settler was allotted a village lot of several acres and rights in common to surrounding lands which were regulated by the town government. The area was transferred to the jurisdiction of New York in 1664.

In large part, early settlers in East Hampton were unacquainted with one another. A great deal of jockeying for position resulted, which took the form of legal proceedings conducted by the town government. Summaries of these proceedings were recorded by the town clerk and form the major resource for historians studying East Hampton during the 17th Century; there are few other written records such as diaries.

The witchcraft accusation against Elizabeth Garlick began in East Hampton.

===19th century===

In the late 19th century, after extension of the railway to Bridgehampton in 1870 by predecessors of the Long Island Rail Road, visitors began to summer, at first in boarding houses on Main Street, then in &quot;cottages,&quot; which sometimes were substantial estates, built on former farms and pastures in the village. Shingle style architecture was popular from the 1880s. By the early 1890s the prices being commanded for cottage sites, as high as $10 thousand an acre, were the object of comment by the editors of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The Montauk Branch of the railroad was extended through East Hampton to Montauk in 1895.

===20th century===
It was during the 1910s and 20s that most luxury estates were built by the very wealthy, mostly in the Eastern Plain, a previously undeveloped agricultural area. The privately circulated &quot;Blue Book of the Hamptons&quot; informed, and continues to inform, fashionable residents as to who is who. The Great Depression and World War II resulted in a lull, but full-scale building of cottages resumed in the 1950s and some of the large estates began to be broken up. By 1968 the exclusive character of the &quot;Summer Colony&quot; had become so diluted by the merely rich that the column of that name in &quot;The East Hampton Star&quot; was discontinued.

The quaint windmills and other sights were favored by artists and art students from the 1890s. It became an artists&#x27; colony in the mid-20th century, popularized by the Abstract Expressionists.

===21st century===
As of the 21st century the Hamptons are a fashionable, if crowded and expensive, weekend destination during the summer season. According to Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty:

History and surviving historic sites are detailed in &quot;Village of East Hampton Multiple Area&quot;, a New York State study.

=== Political ===
On September 15, 2020 the retired Chief of Police Jerry Larsen was elected Mayor in a landslide victory under the Newtown Party political platform to revitalize the downtown and rebuild the village&#x27;s infrastructure. His running mates Chris Minardi and Sandra Melendez Esq. became Trustees of the Village of East Hampton.

On June 21, 2022 the NewTown Party captured two more seats on the Village Board of Trustees for a 5-0 majority easily defeating the incumbent Arthur &quot;Tiger&quot; Graham.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which are land, while , or 2.82% of the total area, is water.

The village gained some territory and lost some territory between the 1990 census and the 2000 census. The neighborhood near Georgica Pond, a tidal pond on the west side of the village is notable for its fashionable residences and high-profile residents.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,334 people, 635 households, and 337 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 1,745 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the village was 93.10% White, 1.42% Black or African American, 0.15% Native American, 1.87% Asian, 1.87% from other races, and 1.57% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.92% of the population.

There were 635 households, out of which 16.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 42.2% were married couples living together, 6.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.9% were non-families. 36.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 18.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.07 and the average family size was 2.68.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 14.4% under the age of 18, 4.5% from 18 to 24, 22.6% from 25 to 44, 31.3% from 45 to 64, and 27.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 52 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.6 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $56,607, and the median income for a family was $62,500. Males had a median income of $41,181 versus $37,083 for females. The per capita income for the village was $51,316. About 5.5% of families and 8.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 13.2% of those under age 18 and 5.8% of those age 65 or older.

== Beaches ==
Parking access to the Atlantic Ocean beaches within the village of East Hampton is severely restricted from May 1 to September 30. In 2006 there were only 2,600 permits available for non-residents with a charge of $250. Residents can always get parking permits.

East Hampton&#x27;s beaches are highly regarded because of their clean white sands, the fact they&#x27;re relatively accessible and because there is minimal development along the beach, which is strictly residential. Parking space at the village beaches is limited, which prevents crowding. Parking is prohibited on neighboring streets. There is no law that restricts people from accessing the beaches via bike, foot or being dropped off.

The beaches of East Hampton Village (from west to east):
*Georgica – This beach adjoining Georgica Pond is popular with surfers because of currents around its controversial groynes. The beach has bathroom facilities.
*Main Beach – The beach is the only one with a pavilion where one can get food; it also has a limited number of lockers available to residents.
*Wiborg Beach – Has a parking lot, and is right next to Maidstone Club. It does not have a lifeguard.
*Egypt Lane Beach – This beach is sometimes incorrectly called Maidstone Beach because of its close proximity to the headquarters of the Maidstone Golf Club. The true Maidstone Beach is on the bay outside the village in the town of East Hampton. Main, Wiborg and Egypt Lane are immediately next to the Maidstone Golf Club.
*Two Mile Hollow – This beach has the second-largest parking lot of the village beaches.

==Regulations==
The size of homes that can be built in East Hampton is regulated. The point is to ensure that new construction is more or less compatible with size of the lot it is constructed on and the neighborhood it is located in.

==Law enforcement==

Law enforcement in East Hampton is the responsibility of the East Hampton Village Police Department, chosen in 2009 for New York State accredited status. The department is located within the town of East Hampton, in Suffolk County. It is headed by Chief of Police Mike Tracey, and staffed by 24 full-time officers, three part -time officers, 17 public safety dispatchers, two full time and 17 part – time paramedics. The department has both a uniformed and detective division.

The police department building is part of the Municipal Emergency Building, located at One Cedar Street in East Hampton.

<text>Islip ( ) is a town in Suffolk County, New York, United States, on the South Shore of Long Island. The population was 339,938 at the time of the 2020 census, making it the fourth most populous city or town in the New York metropolitan area. The Town of Islip also contains a smaller, unincorporated hamlet and census-designated place named Islip.

== History ==
Matthias Nicoll relocated to New York from Islip, Northamptonshire, England, in 1664.
His son, William Nicoll, became a royal patentee of the east end of what is now the Town of Islip, and his domain reached from East Islip to Bayport and included Sayville, West Sayville, Oakdale, Great River, Islip Terrace, Central Islip, Hauppauge, Holbrook, Bohemia, Brentwood, Holtsville, and a portion of Ronkonkoma. All of this land was bought from Winne-quaheagh, Sachem (chief) of Connetquot in 1683. The yearly fee paid to Governor Thomas Dongan of New York was five bushels of quality winter wheat or 25 shillings. Other early land patentees were Andrew Gibb (Islip Hamlet), John Mowbray (Bay Shore, originally Awixa), Stephan Van Cortlandt (Sagtikos Manor), and Thomas Willets (West Islip).

By 1710, the colonial government passed an act to enable the precinct of Islip in the County of Suffolk to elect two assessors, a collector, a constable and a supervisor. The people had a voice. Growth, however, remained at a standstill until the Revolutionary War ended when, in the 17 years that followed, there was more progress than in the 50 years preceding. This activity was partly due to the impact of American shipping.

By 1825, it was necessary to install a Fire Island light across the Great South Bay and regular ferry service between Bay Shore and Fire Island began in 1862. In 1867[?] the Long Island Rail Road came to Islip and the first depot was built. People were discovering Islip and the tourist trade soon took hold.

Tourism brought much wealth into the area and business sprung up to service the hotels that began to dot the landscape. Some of those tourists stayed on and built summer homes, thus the vacationers and the town seemed to enjoy a mutual prosperity. But the old guard was changing. Early in the 20th century, diesel-powered ferries replaced the whale boats while housing developments and small manufacturing firms sprang up on the sites of old farms. Like the rest of the country, Islip and all of Long Island suffered during the Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression. When the veterans returned home from World War II, there was a housing shortage in New York City, but a rebirth on Long Island. Within a decade following the end of the war, Islip began to turn from a bucolic farming community into a bustling suburb, becoming what was once described as a &quot;bedroom&quot; of New York City. The influx of people was tremendous - from 71,000 in 1950 to 280,000 in 1970. Then, as growth continued eastward on Long Island, the pace in Islip slowed.

In 1987, the 430 tons of ash that resulted from incineration of the cargo of the &quot;Mobro 4000&quot; &quot;Garbage Barge&quot; was added to the landfill in Islip. In response to the garbage barge incident, the Town of Islip developed Keep Islip Clean, WRAP, and other environmentally friendly initiatives to help bolster its image. These acts resulted in one of the first comprehensive recycling programs in the United States.

==Geography==
Islip is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the south, Babylon to the west (at approximately Route 231), Smithtown to the north (at approximately the Long Island Expressway), and Brookhaven to the east (at approximately Nicolls Road). It also shares a small border with Huntington to the northwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (36.61%) is water.

The town includes part of Fire Island, Jones Beach Island, and Captree Island, which are separated from Long Island by the Great South Bay.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Islip has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;), with some maritime influence, or under the threshold a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;); it is part of USDA hardiness zone 7a. The normal average monthly temperature ranges from in January to in July; on average, there are 16.3 afternoons where the temperature remains at or below freezing and 8.3 afternoons with a high at or above annually; the last year to not reach the latter mark was 2014. Temperatures below or above are rare, and were last seen respectively on January 7, 2018, at and July 22, 2011, at . The record low is , set on February 13, 1967, while the record high is , set on July 3, 1966.

Precipitation averages annually, and is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, though March and April are the wettest months in terms of total precipitation. Snowfall averages per year, falling almost entirely from November to April.

On August 12 and 13, 2014, a new 24-hour precipitation record for the state of New York was set at , including in 9 minutes during the morning of August 12. This caused flooding on the Southern State Parkway, Sunrise Highway and other area thoroughfares.
==Government==
Islip is governed by a Town Supervisor, a position which is similar to that of a Mayor, and four council members. The council is elected on an at-large basis. Additionally, a Town Clerk and Receiver of Taxes are both duly elected. All of the elected officials serve staggered four year terms. Elections are held on odd years, except when special elections are held pursuant to state law. The current supervisor is Angie Carpenter, a Republican, who was formerly the Suffolk County Treasurer. Carpenter succeeded Tom Croci after he was elected to the New York State Senate in 2015.

The town board has jurisdiction over governmental affairs within the town&#x27;s boundaries, excluding incorporated villages which have their own local governments. Such things include passing a budget and enacting new laws.

The town had a long history of control by the Republican Party; punctuated by two years in 1967. In 1969, the Republicans returned to local power for another 38 years until the 2007 elections gave the Democrats control of the town board. In 2006, Republican Supervisor Peter McGowan resigned due to charges of misuse of campaign funds. In the ensuing special election Phil Nolan, a Democrat, won the supervisor seat. The next year in 2007 Supervisor Nolan ran for his first full term in office with running mates John Edwards and Gene Parrington. All three were elected town-wide and the three Democrats took control of the Town Board for the first time since 1967.

In 2009, new voter registration skewed slightly towards the Democratic Party for the first time in the history of the Town of Islip.

In the 2009 elections, Islip Republicans gained one seat with the election of former News 12 personality Trish Bergin, and the re-election of Councilman Steven Flotteron; leaving the Democrats with a one-seat majority.

The 2011 election witnessed the continued comeback of the Republican Party in Islip. Tom Croci, a veteran running in his first election, led an energized campaign that upset incumbent Supervisor Nolan. In addition, the rest of the Republican ticket was swept into office. Anthony Senft Jr. and John Cochrane Jr. became councilmen, replacing Gene Parrington and John Edwards. Olga Murray became Town Clerk, and Alexis Weik became Receiver of Taxes.

In 2018, four residents sued the town for violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by maintaining a discriminatory at-large council system. One-third of Islip&#x27;s population is Hispanic, but only one person of color has ever been elected to a town seat. As part of the settlement reached in 2020, the at-large system will be abolished and replaced by four council districts by 2023.

<doc id="260090" wikidata="Q11703248" url="?curid=260090" title="Riverhead (CDP), New York">
<text>Riverhead is a census-designated place (CDP) roughly corresponding to the hamlet by the same name located in the Town of Riverhead in Suffolk County, on Long Island, in New York, United States. The CDP&#x27;s population was 13,299 at the 2010 census.

Situated at the mouth of the Peconic River, which empties into Peconic Bay where the North and South Forks of Long Island split, the town of Riverhead (of which the CDP is a part) is the official county seat of Suffolk County. In the 1960s, most of the county offices moved to the CDP of Hauppauge in the towns of Islip and Smithtown in the more populous western half of the county—a move which still spurs attempts for the town of Riverhead to lead the way for the secession of eastern Long Island towns to form Peconic County.

==History==
The hamlet began with the Suffolk County Court House, a 1727 structure built to serve both the North and South Forks. Since that year, Riverhead has served as the seat of Suffolk County, and still contains the primary courts of the region.

Riverhead&#x27;s downtown area formed as an active commercial hub during the 19th century. In the beginning of the 20th century, the community saw an influx of Polish immigrants, as did the rest of the town. This led to the creation of Polish Town, where the popular Polish Town Fair is held annually. The downtown experienced urban blight during the mid-20th century, but recovered as of the beginning of the 21st century.

==Geography==

<text>Riverhead is a town in Suffolk County, New York, United States, on the north shore of Long Island. Since 1727, Riverhead has been the county seat of Suffolk County, though most county offices are in Hauppauge. As of the 2020 census, the population was 35,902. The town rests on the mouth of the Peconic River, from which it derives its name. The smaller hamlet of Riverhead lies within it, and is the town&#x27;s principal economic center. The town is 166 miles (267 km) southwest of Boston via the Orient Point-New London Ferry, and is 76 miles (123 km) northeast of New York City.

In the beginning of the 20th century, the town saw an influx of Polish immigrants. This led to the creation of Polish Town, a section of the Town and County seat where the popular Polish Town Fair is held annually.

Riverhead is the agricultural apex of Long Island, with 20,000 of the 35,000 acres of the island&#x27;s farmland located within the town. The town is also home to four separate beaches which are open year round. Iron Pier, Wading River, and Reeves Beach each offer boating access for residents and visitors alike.

== History ==

European colonists purchased the &quot;Southold land&quot; from the local Algonquian-speaking Native Americans and Shinnecock Indian Nation in 1649. An additional portion was purchased from Col. William Smith and divided among settlers in 1742.

The town of Riverhead was created in 1792 as part of new jurisdictions after the American Revolution. The New York State Legislature divided it from the town of Southold, New York, which lies to the north and east. Riverhead was separated at the behest of its inhabitants, who &quot;represented to the Legislature that their town is so long that it is very inconvenient for them [people of western regions of Southold] to attend at town meetings, and also to transact the other necessary business of the said town, and have prayed that the same may be divided into two towns&quot;. The poor western sections of Southold, with no harbor and little commerce, were thus divided. On March 13, 1792, the Legislature passed a bill splitting off this section under the name River Head. The new enclave&#x27;s first town meeting was scheduled to be held April 3, 1792.

River Head was named the county seat of Suffolk County (called a &quot;county town&quot; at the time), and its name was later combined as Riverhead.

By 1902, its approximate population was 2,500.

<text>Shelter Island is an island town in eastern Suffolk County, New York, United States, near the eastern end of Long Island. The population was 3,253 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

The island was long inhabited by indigenous peoples, related to those who lived north of Long Island Sound. At the time of European encounter, it was occupied by the Manhanset tribe, an Algonquian-speaking people related to the Pequot and other Algonquians of New England. The original name of the island, used by the Manhanset Indians, is Manhansack-aha-quash-awamock, which literally translates to &quot;Island sheltered by islands.&quot;

===Early settlers===

Shelter Island was included in the original Plymouth Company land grant made by James I of England in 1620. On April 22, 1636, Charles I of England, told that the colony had not made any settlements yet on Long Island, gave the island to William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling. The grant gave Alexander all of Long Island and adjacent islands. Alexander gave James Farret power to act as his agent and attorney in colonizing Long Island. In reward Farret was allowed to choose for his personal use. Farret chose Shelter Island and Robin&#x27;s Island for his use. Farret in turn sold the islands to Stephen Goodyear, one of the founders of the New Haven Colony.

In 1651 Goodyear sold the island to a group of Barbados sugar merchants for 1,600 pounds of sugar. Nathaniel Sylvester (1610–1680), one of the merchants, was the island’s first white settler. He was among a number of English merchants who had lived and worked in Rotterdam (where he was born) before going to Barbados. His connections there and with the Netherlands helped him establish a far-flung trading enterprise. On March 23, 1652, he made the purchase official by agreement with Youghco (called Poggatticut), the sachem of the Manhanset tribe. The other owners, Sylvester’s brother Constant, and Thomas Middleton, never came to Long Island. In 1673 Nathaniel Sylvester claimed ownership of Shelter Island, Fishers Island, and other parts of Long Island. By that time the Manhansett had declined in number and power.

In 1652 Sylvester constructed a house on the island for his 17-year-old bride, Grissel (also spelled Grizzel) Brinley from London. Her mother was Anna (Wase) Brinley and her father Thomas Brinley had been an auditor in the court of King Charles I. With the Revolution he had lost his position; Grissel had gone to the colony with her older sister Anne, who had married William Coddington, the governor of the Rhode Island colony. Archeological research in the 21st century has revealed there may have been two early house complexes. The Sylvesters had eleven surviving children. The more elaborate manor house, which survives today, was built in 1733 by a Sylvester grandson.

The Sylvester estate was developed as a large provisioning plantation. It raised food crops, as well as livestock for slaughter, sending casks of preserved meats and other supplies to Barbados. Labor was provided by a multicultural force of enslaved American Indians, enslaved Africans and English indentured servants. Sylvester and his associates were part of the Triangle Trade between the American colonies (including the Caribbean), Africa and England. His descendants continued to use slaves on the plantation into the 19th century. An estimated 200 black people are buried at the Negro Burying Ground on the North Peninsula.

The Sylvesters gave shelter to many persecuted Quakers. Sylvester Manor stands today, just off New York State Route 114, and is controlled by Sylvester descendants. All but about 24 acres of the original thousands of acres have gone into other hands.

Following the death in 1680 of Nathaniel Sylvester, Shelter Island was divided between his two sons, Giles and Nathaniel II. In 1695, William Nicoll, a resident of Islip, bought from Giles the area now called Mashomack Nature Preserve. Three years later, in 1698, another newcomer, George Havens, bought from Nathaniel II. This parcel comprises what today is the Center; it stretched south to South Ferry and west to West Neck Creek. Over time these estates and parcels were split and divided by marriage and purchase, so that by the early 18th century, 20 families lived on Shelter Island. By order of the Provincial Government, the Town of Shelter Island was established in 1730. The community developed from there.

===Colonial era===
James Nicoll Havens, a member of the New York Provincial Congress, built a home on the island in 1743. He was the first town supervisor on the island. His former home is now owned by the local historical society.

Jonathan Nicoll Havens (1757–1799), born on Shelter Island, was a member of the First Continental Congress in 1774. He also served in New York’s delegation that in 1788 approved the federal constitution. Mashomack Forest (today Mashomack Nature Preserve) was owned by the Nicolls family for 230 years. Nicolls Creek was named for that family. A few Manhanset still lived in the wooded Sachem’s Neck area up until the 1790s.

Shelter Island had brushes with early Colonial military activity:
* The British shipped hay from Hay Beach during the American Revolution.
* The schooner &quot;Paragon&quot; was built on the island at Lord’s Shipyard, located on West Neck Creek. In 1804 the ship under Capt. Sam Lord successfully ran a British blockade during the Napoleonic Wars.
* During the War of 1812, the British ransacked numerous homes on the island.

The first ferryboat to serve the island was run by the Boisseau family at Stearns Point, nearby Crescent Beach. The North Ferry began service to Greenport in 1868. Throughout the 19th century, the island continued as a base for fishermen in the surrounding waters. Fish processing plants sent their products across the country.

===Shelter Island Heights established===

Shelter Island Heights was developed in 1871 as a summer resort for camp meetings, after a group of Brooklyn businessmen purchased the Frederick Chase estate for this purpose. It was developed by the Shelter Island Grove and Camp Meeting Association of the Methodist Episcopal Church. For eight years, the camp meetings took place on the island, before moving to Jamesport. During this time, Robert Morris Copeland designed the Union Chapel, built in 1875. In 1984 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

Shelter Island Heights in total was a planned development by Copeland. The houses were designed in classic American styles: Stick-Eastlake, Queen Anne Style, and Colonial Revival. During the eight years from 1872 to 1880, when camp meetings were held here, about 70 summer cottages were built in the Heights. By 1890 the district was well-defined architecturally; the residences have not changed much since then. Shelter Island Heights was listed in 1993 as an Historical District on both the NRHP and the New York State Register of Historic Places.

At the turn of the 20th century, fish processing plants still operated on the island. One was located at the end of Burns Road, another on Big Ram Island, off what is today Tuthill Road. Some summer residents traveled here by steam ferries from New York City.

White Hill is located above the North Ferry landing in Shelter Island Heights. The Prospect Hotel was built on the hill. After it burned down, it was rebuilt, but was destroyed a second time by fire in 1942. Today the land where the hotel was located is a town park.

===Growth after 1900===

Francis Marion Smith (1846–1931) was known as the &quot;Borax King&quot; for his mining successes. Smith and his family bought a home on the island in 1892. He expanded it to more than 30 rooms and called his estate &quot;Presdeleau&quot; (French for &quot;by the water&quot;). By 1906 he owned more than on the south side of the island. Smith Cove and Smith Street were named for him. Smith shipped in deer from California to hunt in his &quot;deer park&quot;; their descendants roam some areas of the island. The remains of his estate are reinforced concrete retaining walls and a &quot;Japanese&quot; footbridge from the garden, built by Ernest L. Ransome about 1898, behind Merkle Lane.

Another 19th-century millionaire who had an estate on Shelter Island was Artemas Ward (1848–1925), a pioneer in mass-market advertising. Ward made millions of dollars by monopolizing all advertising on New York City elevated trains, subways, and streetcars. Ward had a large estate on the south side of the island. Ward wrote a biography of his great-grandfather, Major General Artemas Ward (1727–1800), a commander in the American Revolutionary War. After years of being tied up in court, the vestiges of Ward’s original estate in the Shorewood section of the Island (including a manor house, formal Italian gardens, and a concrete water tower) have been renovated. In the case of the manor house, it has been partially &quot;deconstructed&quot; to restore an earlier version.

Following World War I, development slowly crept onto the island. Summer camps were started in the 1920s, including Camp Quinipet, a United Methodist Church camp and retreat center on Rocky Point Road. On West Neck Harbor, developers Albert and Fred Dickerson built houses for what is today called Montclair Colony. Homes were built on Silver Beach, Ram Island, and Hilo Farms.

Following the Depression, some of the summer cottages were abandoned or left to rot. Recovery was slow. It was not until after World War II that summer residents started returning in larger numbers. During the 1950s a farm cooperative grew lima beans on the island. This was the last of commercial farming on Shelter Island.

In the 1960s and 1970s, more families started to move to Shelter Island as year-round residents. The Gerard family owned the property at Sachem’s Neck that had belonged to the Nicoll family for more than 200 years, and later to financier Otto Kahn. Developers eyed the . The land was purchased in January 1980 by the Nature Conservancy to preserve it as a nature park in perpetuity; half of the funds to buy the forest were raised on the island to create Mashomack Preserve.

There are still numerous Shelter Island residents with family roots dating to families here at the time of the American Revolution. Some summer residents are fifth-generation seasonal visitors.

==Geography==
Shelter Island is nestled between the North and South Forks of Long Island. It is surrounded on three sides by Shelter Island Sound and on the fourth side by Gardiners Bay. It can be reached via ferry from Greenport to the north (an approximately eight-minute trip) or from North Haven to the south (an approximately five-minute trip). The two ferry crossings are connected by New York State Route 114, which crosses the island.

Shelter Island is around in size. Vast tracts are protected wetlands, a nature preserve marshland. Nearly one-third of the island is owned by The Nature Conservancy to be preserved in a wild state. The Preserve has four nature and bird-watching trails, varying in length from to , as well as a barrier-free Braille trail for the visually impaired.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Shelter Island has a total area of , of which is land and (57.49%) is water.

* Dering Harbor, on the north side of the island.

===Neighborhoods (unincorporated)===
* Harbor View, on the west side of the island overlooking West Neck Harbor, is made up of homes built since the 1950s. Originally part of a large egg farm called &quot;Cackle Hill,” the property featured two homes. First, The manor house, which still sits adjacent to Harbor View community on about 17 acres. The second, a smaller farm house, stood on the top of cackle bluff and was removed before development of the community. The farm raised chickens and Lima beans. &quot;Residents&quot;: Several children of the original developers still own homes or properties in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is significant in the early queer rights movement. Several early residents of the neighborhood were queer rights activists, most of whom died in the AIDS epidemic.
* Shelter Island, the hamlet of Shelter Island, located on the south side.
* Shelter Island Heights, on the north side of the island. The Heights was developed as a Methodist Campground in the late 1800s. A private community, it is governed by the Shelter Island Heights Property Owners Corporation, which owns the roads and the North Ferry Company. The Heights was designated on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1993. The Victorian architecture includes 141 contributing buildings and one contributing structure.
* Silver Beach, on a peninsula on the southwest side of the island, overlooks breezy Peconic Bay to the west and West Neck Harbor to the east. Residents of Silver Beach Homeowners Association collectively own several large tracts of undeveloped property, including an 18-acre wooded preserve in the center of the peninsula that is maintained as a bird sanctuary and the access point to Shell Beach, which has a large, protected Piping Plover nesting site. Development on Silver Beach began in the post-World War II era, and many of the homes there are small cottages typical of the time, though some have been expanded.
* Westmoreland, on the west side of the island, was built as a private camp retreat. It is home to one of the Island&#x27;s few remaining equestrian farms and has a private airstrip. The home of the late New York Governor Hugh Carey is on Westmoreland, as is the summer home of comedian Louis C.K.
* Nostrand Parkway runs along the west coast of the island, facing the open waters of Peconic Bay. Several prominent older homes there date to a development in the late 1800s known as West Neck Park. The main road, Nostrand Parkway, takes its name from the developer of West Neck Park.

<text>Smithtown is a town in Suffolk County, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island. It is part of the New York metropolitan area. The population was 116,296 at the 2020 Census.

The census-designated place (CDP) of Smithtown lies within the town&#x27;s borders.

==History==
 The land that would become the town was originally owned by the Nissequogue Native Americans.
===Local legend===
An oft-repeated but apocryphal story has it that, after rescuing a Native American chief&#x27;s abducted daughter, Richard Smith was told that the chief would grant title to all of the land Smith could encircle in one day while riding a bull. Smith chose to ride the bull on the longest day of the year (summer solstice) 1665, to enable him to ride longer &quot;in one day.&quot; The land he acquired in this way is said to approximate the current town&#x27;s borders. A large statue of Smith&#x27;s bull, known as Whisper, pays homage to the legend at the fork of Jericho Turnpike (New York State Route 25) and St. Johnland Road (New York State Route 25A).

===Actual founding===
According to local historians, the bull story is a myth. It was actually English settler Lion Gardiner who had helped rescue the daughter of Nissequogue Grand Sachem Wyandanch, after she was kidnapped by rival Narragansetts. Smith, who lived in nearby Setauket, was a friend of Gardiner; it was at Smith&#x27;s house where the Nissequogue princess was returned to Wyandanch. The Grand Sachem awarded a large tract of land to Gardiner as a gesture of gratitude. In 1663 Gardiner sold the Nissequogue lands to Smith. Two years later, colonial Governor Richard Nicolls recognized the sale by awarding Smith “The Nicolls Patent of 1665,” which formally ratified Smith&#x27;s claim to the land. Thus, 1665 is considered the founding date of the town.

Smithtown was originally known as &quot;Smithfield&quot;.

The border between Smithtown and the town of Huntington is partially defined by Bread and Cheese Hollow Road (Suffolk County Road 4), so named after Bread and Cheese hollow, which according to legend is where Smith stopped on his ride to have a lunch of bread and cheese. The road is reputed to follow part of his original ride. The border between Smithtown and Huntington was also the site of Fort Salonga, a British fort that was the site of a battle of the American Revolution during 1781.
The Smithtown hamlet of Nesconset was the home of Spaceplex, an indoor amusement park and arcade that was falsely accused of being the abduction site in the Katie Beers kidnapping case in 1992.

===350th anniversary===
The town celebrated its 350th anniversary with the unveiling of a new statue of founder Richard Smith, in front of an office building at the intersection of Main Street and Route 111.

==Geography==
Smithtown is bounded by Long Island Sound to the north, Islip to the south, Brookhaven to the east, and Huntington to the west.

==Government and politics==
The present town hall and seat of the town was built in 1912 on Main Street in Smithtown.

In 2015 the town hall was dedicated and renamed after former Supervisor Patrick R. Vecchio.

Smithtown is led by a Town Supervisor and a four-member Town Council, elected town-wide with each serving four year terms. Elections are held in odd-numbered years, with two of the councilmembers being up for re-election each year.

The current Supervisor is Edward Wehrheim who has been Town Supervisor since 2018. His predecessor, Patrick Vecchio was in office for forty years, the longest elected town supervisor in the history of the United States. Elected as a Democrat during a special election, Vecchio switched parties in 1993 in an attempt to run for County Executive. Although defeated in the primary by Robert Gaffney, Vecchio remained a Republican until his death in 2019. He is the longest serving town supervisor in all of New York State. Vecchio ran in 2013 against former Councilman Robert Creighton, of the Conservative Party. Supervisor Vecchio won the Republican Primary against Councilman Creighton and then later defeated the Councilman in the General Election 45-30%. The Democratic candidate, Steven Snair received 25% of the vote. Councilman Creighton was later ousted in 2015 by Lisa Inzerillo. In the 2017 Republican primary, then-Councilman Ed Wehrheim received about forty votes more than Vecchio. The race was too close to call and a recount was demanded by Vecchio. Following the recount a week later, Wehrheim was declared the winner, nearly doubling his lead. Vecchio conceded the race the same day saying &quot;“All good things come to an end.&quot; On November 7, 2017, Ed Wehrheim defeated William Holst in the election for the town&#x27;s next supervisor. Wehrheim succeeded Vecchio on January 1, 2018. On January 10, 2018, Thomas Lohmann was appointed to the seat vacated by Wehrheim&#x27;s election.

The Town of Smithtown has always been dominated by Republicans at all levels of government. This one-party domination has often led to infighting between factions of the Republican Party in Smithtown with the most recent between Supervisor Vecchio and Smithtown Republican Party Chairman William Ellis. In recent times the Republican party has dominated the Town Board; the last Democratic Town Supervisor being Mr. Vecchio. The most Republican areas for Smithtown are its three incorporated villages, Nissequogue, Head of the Harbor, and the Branch, along with the hamlets of Smithtown and Kings Park. The weakest areas for the Republican party in Smithtown is the edges of the Town in the hamlets of Commack and Hauppauge. In 2016, Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by a margin of 25 percent. Democratic County Executive Steve Bellone has won the town, in two of his three runs for that office.

In addition to presidential politics, the Town of Smithtown is also the power bases of many State and County elected officials. The former New York State Senate Majority Leader John J. Flanagan had the bulk of his district located in Smithtown. Current Republican Comptroller John M. Kennedy, Jr., along with his wife, Suffolk County Legislator Leslie Kennedy both reside in Nesconset.

Former Supervisor Vecchio died on April 6, 2019, at the age of 88.

<doc id="260096" wikidata="Q3826291" url="?curid=260096" title="Southampton (village), New York">
<text>Southampton is an incorporated village in the Town of Southampton in Suffolk County, on the South Fork of Long Island, in New York, United States. The population was 4,550 at the 2020 census, an increase of 46.3% from the 2010 census a decade earlier.

The Incorporated Village of Southampton serves as the Town Seat of the Town of Southampton, and is the oldest and largest of communities in the summer colony known as The Hamptons.

== History ==
Southampton, settled in 1640 and incorporated as a village in 1894, historically began with a small group of English settlers who set sail from Lynn, Massachusetts, and landed on June 12, 1640, at what is now known as Conscience Point. It is the oldest English settlement in the state of New York and is named after the English Earl of Southampton.

The Shinnecock tribe welcomed the arrival of the white settlers in 1640 and not only gave them land to live on, &quot;Olde Towne&quot;, but also shared with the settlers their knowledge of planting corn and fertilizing it with fish, growing crops, digging clams and scallops from nearby bays and trapping game. During the 18th and 19th centuries, fishing, farming (especially potatoes and the local sweet corn) and duck raising were the predominant industries.

The early settlers, with the help of a resident Shinnecock Indian guide, were led over an old woodland trail that is now North Sea Road to an ideal spot for their first settlement. There, at the head of what today is Old Town Pond, they constructed their first homes. The Shinnecock Reservation, established in 1701, is one of the oldest Native American reservations in the United States.

A property called the Halsey House was a homestead by pioneer Thomas Halsey in 1640. A rare &quot;first period&quot; house was built in 1660 when Main Street, in the pioneer hamlet of Southampton, was first laid out. Its owner, Thomas Halsey, was one of the original families who bought property from the Shinnecocks in 1640. It is one of the oldest English-type frame houses in the state.

===Summer Colony===
Theodore Gaillard Thomas, a New York City physician is regarded at the founder of the resort community, also termed the Summer Colony, of Southampton. He convinced a number of his wealthy clients about the beauty and potential restorative nature of the rural environment of Southampton. His efforts to develop this resort community began in 1863. He proved very successful at establishing what grew into a very prominent and affluent community of summer residents. Thomas and his friends ultimately established many of the leading institutions in Southampton including the St. Andrews Dune Church, the Shinnecock Golf Club, the Meadow Club, the Southampton Beach Club and The Parrish Art Museum (now located in Water Mill, NY).

Over time, several of the other villages and hamlets in what has become called the Hamptons increasingly became a haven for affluent summer season vacationers. Southampton Village, which hosted the earliest summer community of socially prominent residents and was arguably the center for upper class Americans, grew larger and faster than the others. Southampton has served as home to members of the Ford, Du Pont, Morgan, Atterbury, Woolworth and Eisenhower families.

===21st century===
Southampton Village is regarded as one of the premier summer resort areas in the country. The community of summer residents occupy the top echelon of American social, political and financial circles.

Accordingly, real estate is extremely expensive in the village. The Estate Section, which contains the majority of the homes for the very affluent residents, lies directly north of the Atlantic oceanfront and extends to Hill Street. Particular streets of note in the area include Ox Pasture Road, Halsey Neck Lane, Coopers Neck Lane, First Neck Lane, and South Main Street. The homes around Lake Agawam, referred to by Thomas as &quot;the very center of our Summer Colony&quot;, are particularly noteworthy for their architectural pedigree and historical provenance.

The oceanfront roads—Gin Lane and Meadow Lane—are generally the most expensive roads in the village. Meadow Lane in particular has been called Billionaire Lane, and cited as having among the most expensive residential real estate in the country.

Other areas in the village house the relatively large population of year-round residents. These neighborhoods extend from Hill Street northwards to Route 27, east to the hamlet of Water Mill, and west to the area of Tuckahoe in Southampton Town.

The Shinnecock Indian Reservation borders the village on its southwestern border. Shinnecock Hills Golf Club one of the oldest and most prestigious golf courses in the country, borders the village on its northwest corner. The Art Village, a summer art school started by William Merritt Chase and funded by early residents of the Southampton Summer Colony, is still in existence, though now it is entirely private residences; no arts education is conducted in the Art Village any more.

There are several working farms and agricultural preserves in the village. Most of those properties are located in the Estate Section, particularly in the Wickapogue Road Historic District.

Southampton Village boasts well regarded ocean beaches including Cooper&#x27;s Beach, which was voted #3 in a recent national poll. In 2010, it was listed as &quot;America&#x27;s top beach&quot;, according to the annual list of the best American beaches compiled by Stephen Leatherman, AKA Dr. Beach.

<text>Southampton, officially the Town of Southampton, is a town in southeastern Suffolk County, New York, partly on the South Fork of Long Island. As of the 2020 U.S. census, the town had a population of 69,036. Southampton is included in the stretch of shoreline prominently known as the Hamptons.

Stony Brook University has a campus in Southampton.

==History==
The town was founded in 1640, when settlers from Lynn, Massachusetts, established residence on lands obtained from local Shinnecock Indian Nation. The first settlers included eight men, one woman, and a boy who came ashore at Conscience Point. These men were Thomas Halsey, Edward Howell, Edmond Farrington, Allen Bread, Edmund Needham, Abraham Pierson the Elder, Thomas Sayre, Josiah Stanborough, George Welbe, Henry Walton and Job Sayre. By July 7, 1640, they had determined the town boundaries. During the next few years (1640–43), Southampton gained another 43 families; there are now thousands of people in Southampton.

From 1644, the colonists established an organized whale fishery, significant in the history of whaling as the first in New England. They chased pilot whales (&quot;blackfish&quot;) onto the shelving beaches for slaughter, a sort of dolphin drive hunting. They also processed drift whales they found on shore. They observed the Native Americans&#x27; hunting techniques, improved on their weapons and boats, and then went out to ocean hunting.

The first meeting house was on a hill that is the site of the current Southampton Hospital. The town&#x27;s oldest existent house is the Halsey House at 249 Main Street, which was built by Thomas Halsey, one of the first Englishmen to trade with the Shinnecocks.
Southampton has 47 public and private cemeteries, not including Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, which is claimed as an Indian burial ground that is no longer in active use. Southampton is named after the port city of Southampton in Hampshire, England.

Southampton operates an official historical web site. The site shows the locations of over 100 points of interest, historic markers, and historic districts as well as over 1500 photos.

===Native American land claim===
In 2005, the Shinnecock Indian Nation filed a lawsuit against the state seeking the return of 3,500 acres (14 km2) in Southampton near the tribe&#x27;s reservation, and billions of dollars in reparations for damages suffered by colonial land grabs. The disputed property includes the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, which Shinnecock say is the location of tribe burial grounds. The tribe challenged the state legislatures&#x27; approval of an 1859 sale of the 3,500 acres of tribal land. The tribe alleged this broke the terms of a 1,000-year-lease signed by Southampton colonial officials and the tribe in 1703. The suit charged that in 1859, a group of powerful New York investors conspired to break the lease by sending the state Legislature a fraudulent petition from a number of Shinnecock tribal members. Although other tribal members immediately protested that the petition was a forgery, the legislature approved the sale of 3,500 acres (14 km2) of tribal land. In 2006, the court ruled against the tribe finding the lawsuit was barred by laches.

<text>Southold is a census-designated place (CDP) that generally corresponds to the hamlet by the same name in the Town of Southold in Suffolk County, New York, United States. The CDP population was 5,748 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

Southold was the first English settlement in the future New York State, though this is partially due to a historical technicality—the territory of New Netherland was still owned by the Dutch at the time, but Southold lay in a part of Long Island that was part of Connecticut at the time and was later ceded in a legal dispute.

English Puritans from New Haven, Connecticut, settled in Southold on October 21, 1640. Under the leadership of the Reverend John Youngs, with Peter Hallock (after lots were drawn, the first to step ashore), the settlement consisted of the families of Barnabas Horton, John Budd, John Conklin, William Wells, John Tuthill, Thomas Mapes, Richard Terry, Matthias Corwin, Robert Akerly, Zachariah Corey and Isaac Arnold. The land had been purchased in the summer of 1640 from an Indian tribe, the Corchaugs. The Indian name of what became Southold was &quot;Yenicott&quot;.

Southold was to remain under the jurisdiction of New Haven until 1662, and of Connecticut until 1674. When the colony of New York was handed over to the Dutch in 1673, the eastern towns, including Southold, Easthampton and Southampton, refused to submit; the Dutch attempted to force the matter by arms, and the colonists of the towns repelled them, with assistance from Connecticut. When New York became English again in 1674, these eastern towns preferred to stay part of Connecticut, and Connecticut agreed, but the government of James, Duke of York, forced the matter. New York Governor Sir Edmund Andros threatened to eliminate the residents&#x27; rights to land if they did not yield, which they did by 1676. This is largely a result of the Duke of York&#x27;s grudge against Connecticut, as New Haven had hidden three of the judges who sentenced the Duke&#x27;s father, King Charles I, to death in 1649.

The name Southold is believed by some to be a misspelling of Southwold, which is a coastal town in the corresponding English county of Suffolk. This claim is debatable, but John Youngs was born and brought up in Southwold. Also within the New York hamlet is an area known as Reydon Shores. Reydon is the adjoining village to Southwold in England and was the home of John Youngs&#x27; wife. An alternative explanation is that the name refers to a &quot;holding&quot; to the south of New Haven, from whence the original settlers hailed. Many of the hamlet&#x27;s older structures are included in the Southold Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

<text>The Town of Southold is one of ten towns in Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is located in the northeastern tip of the county, on the North Fork of Long Island. The population was 23,732 at the 2020 census. The town contains a hamlet, also named Southold, which was settled in 1640.

==History==
Algonquian-speaking tribes, related to those in New England across Long Island Sound, lived in eastern Long Island before European colonization. The western portion of the island was inhabited by bands of Lenape, whose language was also one of the Algonquian languages.

In surrounding areas, the Dutch colonists had established early settlements to the northwest: on the upper Hudson River was Fort Orange, founded in 1615 (later renamed Albany by the English); and New Amsterdam (later renamed Manhattan) in 1625. Lion Gardiner established a manor on Gardiners Island in East Hampton in 1639. Just across from Long Island, the Connecticut Colony, or Connecticut River Colony, was established in 1636. The Puritans established New Haven Colony separately in 1638, even though it was largely surrounded by Connecticut Colony. New Haven Colony was a theocracy, governed only by church members.

English Puritans from New Haven Colony settled in Southold on October 21, 1640. They had purchased the land in the summer of 1640 from the group of Indians related to the Pequot of New England, who lived in the territory they called &quot;Corchaug&quot; (now Cutchogue). Settlers spelled the Indian name of what became Southold as &quot;Yennicott&quot;. In most histories Southold is reported as the first English settlement on Long Island in the future New York State. Under the leadership of the Reverend John Youngs, with Peter Hallock, the settlement consisted of the families of Barnabas Horton, John Budd, John Conklin, John Swazy, William Wells, John Tuthill, and Matthias Corwin.

In 1650, the Treaty of Hartford established a boundary between Dutch and English claims roughly through Oyster Bay on the North Shore. The Dutch colony was the western part of Long Island, and the English dominated the east. The population of Southold at that point was about 180. The harbor at Greenport, on the North Fork, became important in trade, fishing, and whaling, because it rarely froze over. Settlers developed the interior land for agricultural purposes.

Both New Haven Colony and Connecticut Colony had sought to establish Southold as a theocracy. The New Haven Colony did not permit other churches to operate at all, while the Connecticut Colony allowed freedom of religion. New Haven supervised Southold until 1662, when New Haven towns began shifting their allegiance to the surrounding Connecticut Colony. By 1664, New Haven colonists all had decided to join Connecticut, and the New Haven colony ceased to exist. Southold was supervised by the Connecticut Colony until 1674.

When the Dutch took control of the colony of New York in 1673, the English-settled eastern towns, including Southold, East Hampton, and Southampton, refused to submit; the Dutch attempted to force the matter by arms, and the colonists of the towns repelled them, with assistance from Connecticut. When New York was retaken by the English in 1674, these eastern towns preferred to stay part of Connecticut. Although Connecticut agreed, the government of James, Duke of York forced the matter for them to be part of the Province of New York. Governor Sir Edmund Andros threatened to eliminate the residents&#x27; rights to land if they did not yield, which they did by 1676. The Duke of York had a grudge against Connecticut. New Haven had hidden three of the judges who sentenced his father King Charles I to death in 1649.

The town called as its second minister Rev. Joshua Hobart, a Harvard graduate from Hingham, Massachusetts, and son of Rev. Peter Hobart. The latter was the founding minister of Old Ship Church, the nation&#x27;s oldest church in continuous use. Rev. Joshua Hobart was installed in 1674 and served until his death in 1717, when he was 88 years old. Rev. Hobart&#x27;s brother Josiah was one of the earliest settlers and initial trustees of East Hampton, Long Island, as well as High Sheriff of Suffolk County.

The name Southold is believed to be an elision of Southwold, a coastal town in the corresponding English county of Suffolk. John Youngs, the minister who was one of the founders of the Town, was born and brought up in Southwold, England. Youngs was a member of St. Margaret&#x27;s Church in nearby Reydon. Within the Town&#x27;s limits is an area known as Reydon Shores, perhaps a reference to the Reydon, England known by Youngs. The Town&#x27;s name also may refer to a &quot;holding&quot; to the south [of New Haven]), from whence the original settlers hailed.

In the meantime, the population of Southold grew from 180 in 1650 to 880 by 1698.

In the late 19th century, the Long Island Rail Road extended its line on the North Shore to Greenport. This enabled summer vacationers to travel to the destination by train. Due to the light on the North Fork from water on both sides, the area attracted many artists, including William Merritt Chase.

The area was agricultural, and long dominated by for potato farming. In the late 20th century, large areas of the North Fork were redeveloped as vineyards. This area of Long Island has developed a respectable wine industry. In November 1994, the village of Greenport voted to abolish its police department and contract with the Southold Town Police for law enforcement.

<text>Callicoon is a hamlet and census-designated place in the Town of Delaware, Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 206 at the 2020 census.

Callicoon is in the western part of the county in the Town of Delaware and along the Delaware River.

==History==

Callicoon got its name from Dutch hunters who settled in the location in the 1600s. Because of the population of wild turkeys in the area, they named the community &quot;Kollikoonkill&quot; which translates into &quot;Wild Turkey Creek&quot;. In addition to animal abundance, the area was a source for lumber and a transport center with the Delaware River offering access to coastal cities to the south and east. In the 1840s, the Erie Railroad added to transportation by passing through along the banks of the Delaware River to link the Great Lakes with the East Coast. Because of the train station&#x27;s vital central location, the community was renamed &quot;Callicoon Depot&quot;.

In 1888, a major fire destroyed much of Callicoon&#x27;s business district. The town quickly rebuilt, but lost much of its architectural history prior to the late 19th century. The community&#x27;s economy also became badly damaged when railroad travel gave way to the automobile. The last scheduled passenger train left Callicoon on November 27, 1966. By the late 1960s, tourism took over as the main industry as campgrounds and canoes drew a new generation of visitors. Campgrounds and canoe liveries, followed by bed and breakfast inns, drew a new generation of vacationers. The Villa Roma Resort and Conference Center also opened, increasing the number of vacationers to the area. Additionally, the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River was created in 1978 to protect the land of the scenic valley, maintain quality of the Delaware River and enforce environmental sensitivity in the area.

The recently formed Sullivan West Central School District still owns the school building in Callicoon, but has left it vacant.

Callicoon is the location of the Delaware Valley Job Corps Center, a job training facility located since 1979 in the former St. Joseph&#x27;s Seraphic Seminary.

<text>Liberty is a town in Sullivan County, New York, United States. The population was 10,159 at the 2020 census. The village is bisected by NY 52 and NY 55, and is crossed by NY 17.

== History ==

The town of Liberty area is credited with providing 303 men who fought in the Revolution. Liberty was carved originally from the then large township of Lumberland and was itself at this time so large that it included the present Towns of Callicoon and Fremont. The Town today covers 85 square miles.

When the first settlers came to this area, known as the Blue Mountain country, they settled to the Northwest of the present village at the existing Revonah Lake formerly known as Broadhead Pond. The early settlers came here from Connecticut and some of the oldest remains left in the Town are the laid up stones in the outlet of Revonah Lake which were probably placed there in 1797 for the purpose of building the first sawmill in the area.

As the land was cleared of the dense dark hemlock forest that the early settlers found, the area went through various stages of development. After the farms were cleared one of the earlier forms of industry to be established was the tanneries which ran through the Civil War era. Following this, the dairy farming came into its own, to be followed by the taking in of “summer boarders” which gradually led to the founding of the large hotels: the Wawonda, Liberty House and many others.

It was along about 1900 that the large Loomis Sanatorium was established for the care of TB or tubercular patients and Liberty in general went through another stage of its development which lasted until other cures beside the fresh air and rest were found.

It was also early in the century that the Workmen&#x27;s Circle, a leading Jewish fraternal order, built a sanatorium east of Liberty: the property now occupied by the County Home and Infirmary and also the site of the Social Service Buildings.

Then, the town in general fell back to its dependency upon the tourists and its so-called summer season. Being blessed with an abundance of rural beauty and nearness to the metropolitan area provides many advantages in this respect.

As the years went by, and different settlements began to develop, they eventually became the Village and Hamlets that we know today. Some of the old settlements either changed their names or were lost in the ways of progress. Doubtenville, Glen Cove, Egypt and Red Brick are just a few of the lost communities.

Still remaining within the confines of the Town of Liberty today are the Village of Liberty and the smaller hamlets of Ferndale, Parksville, Swan Lake and White Sulphur Springs.

The Village of Liberty, incorporated on September 17, 1870, is by far the largest of the Town&#x27;s communities, being located at the crossroads of the Quickway (Route 17) and State Highway Route 52.

Liberty can boast of its tanneries, of the old Liberty Normal Institute, established in 1847, its famous Coaching Day Parades, and its hotels of the 1900 era. The Liberty House was the greatest and was the site of many Lincoln Dinners and reunions of the Grand Army of the Republic.

Of the smaller hamlets, Parksville is the only one to maintain its original name. Even before the formation of the Town of Liberty there were people in this area. The Martins and the Halls were early settlers, arriving in 1804. At a later date the Parks family came to the area and proved to be extremely active and productive and through their efforts came the name Parksville; otherwise, it more than likely would have been known as “Martinsville.”

White Sulphur Springs was originally called Robertsonville, being named for Bradley Robertson, who left Connecticut and settled in the area in 1809, and later fought in the war of 1812.

The Hamlet has always been a rural area. At one time it was surrounded by many small dairy farms and had a cheese factory operating within its bounds.

In the 1890s and early 1900s it was doing a thriving hotel and Boarding House business. It was during this period of time that a large hotel, called the White Sulphur Springs House was built. The hotel took its name from the Sulphur Spring whose waters were supposed to have medicinal benefits which were obtainable either by drinking or bathing in it.

In December, 1890 Robertsonville officially changed its name to White Sulphur Springs, no doubt to further help the promotion of the tourist trade.

In later years many additional hotels were constructed in the Hamlet and the business flourished in the summer for many years.

Ferndale, originally known as Liberty Falls, was settled by Roswell Russell in 1807. During the Civil War era, it had thriving tanneries within its confines. The tall brick chimney of one of the tanneries stood until sometime in the 1950s, when it was taken down for its bricks.

The name was changed from Liberty Falls to Ferndale by the NYO&amp;W Railway because of a mix up of the mails.

The name Ferndale covers a much larger area than the hamlet itself.

Ferndale is credited with having the Grossinger Resort Hotel within its boundaries. This large layout all started by the Grossinger family taking in a few summer boarders to help meet expenses in 1914.

Swan Lake originally called Stevensville, was named after the Stevens brothers, who built a large sole leather tannery there. The tannery was in existence until about 1873.

Since the 1880s, the Swan Lake area has been noted for its hotel and tourist industry. Many of the local farm girls found jobs there in the early 1900s. The lake has always had an abundance of fish and brings sportsmen into the area.

Alden S. Swan arrived there from New York about 1895 and by the time of his death in 1917 owned much of the land and all of the lake. The name was changed to Swan Lake in January 1927. The Swan estate was purchased by Siegel and Kretchmer, and the Siegels went on to build the Commodore and Stevensville Hotels: the latter developing into a large, sprawling hotel run by the Dinnerstein family.

Liberty was a mainstay, with Grossinger&#x27;s Hotel and several other Borscht Belt attractions, but, once their doors closed, so ended the lifestyle which made Liberty desirable to tourism.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 80.7 square miles (209.0 km2), of which 79.6 square miles (206.2 km2) is land and 1.1 square miles (2.8 km2) (1.36%) is water.

==History==
The first permanent settlers arrived around 1791. This area was called Brown&#x27;s Settlement and was part of the Town of Berkshire until it was organized as the &quot;Town of Westville&quot; in 1823. In 1824, the town changed its name to &quot;Newark,&quot; at the suggestion of a settler from New Jersey, but then changed the name to Newark Valley in 1862, to avoid conflict with the name of a village in Wayne County.

One of the earliest settlers was Richard Sarles (1753-1849), a native of Bedford (town), New York and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War whose descendants share a common heritage albeit with various spelling permutations (Searles, Sarles, Sarlls). The area where he settled was known as Searlestown, between Newark Valley (village), New York and Flemingville Owego, New York, and the cemetery where he and over two dozen Newark Valley relatives and descendants are buried bears that same name.

The Belcher-Holden Farm, Bement-Billings House, Blewer Farm, Daniel Chamberlain House, Morris Clinton House, Farrand-Pierson House, Lipe Farm, Maple Lawn Farm, John Settle Farm, Wade Farm, West Newark Congregational Church and Cemetery, and West Newark School House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Parks and recreation==
There are three parks and recreation areas which are located in either the town or village of Newark Valley.

*Alexander Park - The park was built and donated by Don Alexander in the early 1960s. It continues to be a peaceful tract of land with a serene lake located west of the Newark Valley Middle School. Many community service groups come to utilize this park and help with the upkeep of maintenance.
*Trout Ponds - This beautiful Victorian park was built in 1869 by Mr. Waring who wanted to breed trout, provide a recreation area for the public, and provide a place to build custom fly rods. In its heyday, travelers flocked in masses from the Southern Central Railroad as far as Scranton, Pa, and Syracuse, NY for outdoor family parties and picnicking. Public usage declined toward the turn of the century and New York State took possession to run this park solely as trout breeding. In the 1950s, the village of Newark Valley bought this parcel of land for one dollar from New York State. This family park is still in use for the community to enjoy picnics and reunions.
*Bement-Billings Farmstead - The Farmstead is currently owned and operated by the Newark Valley Historical Society. It is a living history site that interprets the period c.1810. The Farmstead was established by Asa Bement, one of the first settlers who came to Northern Tioga County in 1791. The house was donated by Mrs. Myrtie Louise Billings Hills in 1976 to the newly formed Historical Society. Outbuildings include an English threshing barn, an outhouse, a sap house, a blacksmith shop, a small barn and a farmer&#x27;s workshop. The Society currently has . The Farmstead is open to the public on weekends from the first weekend in July until the Apple Festival, the first weekend in October. School tours are often conducted in May and June. The Apple Festival is its largest fundraiser.
*Newark Valley Community Center - Formerly known as the Newark Valley United Church of Christ, this building has been reshaped into a spot for the community to gather for events such as karaoke and craft fairs. The space is open to being rented out for family events, birthday parties, and other social gatherings. As of 2024, the Newark Valley Community Center is still being renovated and refurbished by volunteering students from Newark Valley High School&#x27;s Interact Club and community members.

<text>Owego is a town in Tioga County, New York, United States. The population was 18,728 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from the Iroquois word &quot;Ahwaga&quot;, meaning &quot;where the valley widens&quot;.

Owego is in the southeastern corner of the county, west of Binghamton. The village of Owego is in the western part of the town.

== History ==
The town was first settled around 1786. The original town of Owego was created at the time Tioga County was formed in 1791. This original town was reduced by formation of later towns in the county. The town&#x27;s name is a derivative of the Iroquois word &quot;ahwaga&quot;, which means &quot;where the valley widens&quot;. This name came from the vast floods that run into the valley when the winter snows melt, which caused several deaths a year.

The current town of Owego was formed as the town of Tioga in 1800 from the town of Union (now in Broome County).

Confusion over the location of the village of Owego caused the legislature to have the towns of Owego and Tioga switch names in 1813 so that Owego village was within the same-named town.

The Hiawatha Farm, Waits Methodist Episcopal Church and Cemetery, and Vesper Cliff are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

The Susquehanna River flows across the town, dividing it into two parts. Owego Creek flows into the Susquehanna at Owego village and marks the western town line.

===Transportation===
The Southern Tier Expressway (New York State Route 17) crosses the town on the river&#x27;s south bank. New York State Route 17C follows the river along the north bank. New York State Route 38 and New York State Route 96 converge north of Owego village.

Until the 1960s, the Erie Lackawanna Railroad operated passenger trains through Owego, for trips from Buffalo to Hoboken, New Jersey: the &quot;Phoebe Snow&quot;, ending in 1966; the overnight &quot;New York Mail&quot;/ &quot;Owl&quot;, ending in 1967; and the Lake Cities between Chicago and Hoboken, which was the last EL passenger train through Owego on January 6, 1970.

From evidence discovered &quot;circa&quot; 1850, the St. Francis Native Americans appear to have used the town for hunting and making tools in the past.
This border area between Vermont and New York was, for a long period, not clearly under control of either state. Arrivals from New England settled here, hoping to gain the benefits of New England in areas such as land ownership and voting rights. Early settlers arrived before 1770, but the state line was not established until 1790, leaving settlers in this town within New York State.

The town was founded in 1780.

Early agricultural efforts included dairy herds and sheep raising.

Extensive slate deposits were located in 1846 in nearby Fair Haven, and in 1850 more slate deposits were found in Middle Granville. The first Granville slate quarries opened around 1853. The first slate deposits had been located in 1839 and were used for local construction.

==Geography==
The eastern town line is the border of Vermont (Rutland County).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 56.1 square miles (145.4 km2), of which 56.1 square miles (145.2 km2) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.05%) is water.

Residents voted in favor, 192 to 49, of dissolving the Village of Salem on August 5, 2014. A final dissolution plan was adopted and passed on April 16, 2015. The village officially dissolved on March 31, 2016. It should be classified as a census-designated place by the U.S. Census Bureau within the next couple years. All government activities previously managed by the village are now handled by the Town of Salem.

<doc id="260160" wikidata="Q387692" url="?curid=260160" title="Great Britain road numbering scheme">
<text>In Great Britain, there is a numbering scheme used to classify and identify all roads. Each road is given a single letter (representing a category) and a subsequent number (between one and four digits). Though this scheme was introduced merely to simplify funding allocations, it soon became used on maps and as a method of navigation. There are two sub-schemes in use: one for motorways, and another for non-motorway roads.

While some of Great Britain&#x27;s major roads form part of the international E-road network, no E-routes are signposted in the United Kingdom. Due to changes in local road designation, in some cases roads are numbered out of zone. There are also instances where two unrelated roads have been given exactly the same number; for example, the Leicester Ring Road and a road in Cumbria are both designated A594.

This scheme applies only to England, Scotland and Wales; a separate system using similar conventions is used in Northern Ireland, as well as outside the United Kingdom in the Isle of Man, Jersey and British Overseas Territories.

== History ==
Work on classification began in 1913. The Road Board had been established in 1909 to administer Vehicle Excise Duty - money raised by taxation to pay for new road construction and for repair of damage done to existing roads by the growing number of motorists. As the Board needed to work out which roads should be funded, upgraded or replaced, its secretary, William Rees Jeffreys, appointed Henry Maybury, one of the Board&#x27;s senior engineers, to devise a classification system and then assign numbers to the highways for identification purposes. The work was interrupted by the First World War. It did not resume until the Ministry of Transport was formed in 1919 and given authority to classify highways and to allocate funding for road maintenance, authority for which was granted by section 17 (2) of the Ministry of Transport Act 1919. A classification system was created in 1922, under which important routes connecting large population centres, or for through traffic, were designated as Class I, and roads of lesser importance were designated as Class II. The definitive list of those roads was published on 1 April 1923, following consultations with local authorities. Government funding towards the repairs of these roads were set at 60% for the former and 50% for the latter.

Shortly after this, the numbers started to appear in road atlases and on signs on the roads themselves, making them a tool for motorists in addition to their use for determining funding. The numbers of the roads changed quite frequently during the early years of the system, because it was a period of rapid expansion of the network and some numbered routes did not follow the most usual routes taken. The Trunk Roads Act 1936 gave the Ministry direct control of major routes and a new classification system was created to identify these routes. Originally, those numbers beginning in T were to be made public, but that was eventually deemed unnecessary.

With the introduction of motorways in the late 1950s, a new classification of &quot;M&quot; was introduced. In many cases the motorways duplicated existing stretches of A road, which therefore lost much of their significance and were in some cases renumbered. There was no consistent approach to the renumbering – some A roads retained their existing number as non-primary roads (e.g. the A40 running alongside the M40), others were given &quot;less significant&quot; numbers (e.g. the A34 in Warwickshire became the A3400 after the M40 was built), and the remainder were downgraded to B or unclassified roads (e.g. the A38, which was replaced by the M5 between Tiverton and Exeter). Occasionally, the new motorway would take the name of the old A road rather than having its own number. The most notable example of that is the A1(M).

== Zoning system ==
=== Non-motorway ===
In England and Wales the road numbering system for all-purpose (i.e. non-motorway) roads is based on a radial pattern centred on London. In Scotland the same scheme is centred on Edinburgh. In both cases the main single-digit roads normally define the zone boundaries. The exception is between Zones 1 and 2, where the River Thames defines the boundary so that all of Kent is in 
Zone 2.

* Zone 1: North of the Thames, east of the A1 covering much of North London, Essex, Cambridgeshire, East Anglia, Lincolnshire, parts of Yorkshire, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, Northumberland, parts of the Scottish Borders, East Lothian and on up to Edinburgh
* Zone 2: South of the Thames, east of the A3 covering most of South London, part of Surrey, Sussex and Kent
* Zone 3: North/West of the A3, south of the A4 covering part of Surrey, Hampshire (excluding Portsmouth), the Isle of Wight and South West England
* Zone 4: North of the A4, south/west of the A5 covering the south and West Midlands, Oxfordshire, Bristol, Gloucestershire, Buckinghamshire and south, west and Mid Wales.
* Zone 5: North/East of the A5, west of the A6, south of the Solway Firth/Eden Estuary covering North Wales, North Midlands, western Leicestershire, Cheshire, Cumbria and western Lancashire. In Central London, the A40 (Holborn Viaduct, Holborn, High Holborn and Oxford Street) provides a border between the 4 and 5 zones east of Marble Arch. The original A5 (now renumbered A5183) also provides such a border, and north of St Albans the original A6 (now renumbered A1081) provides an Eastern border.
* Zone 6: East of the A6 and A7, west of the A1 covering eastern Lancashire, North East England, Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, eastern Leicestershire and Rutland, and the Scottish Borders and Lothians. Between St Albans and Luton, the original A6 (now renumbered A1081) provides the Western border of the 6-zone.
* Zone 7: North of the Solway Firth/Eden Estuary, west of the A7, south of the A8 covering Dumfries and Galloway, Ayrshire and Central Scotland, including Glasgow south of the Clyde.
* Zone 8: North of the A8, west of the A9 covering northern Glasgow, Argyll and Bute, Highland and the Western Isles
* Zone 9: North of the A8, east of the A9 covering Fife, North East Scotland, Orkney and Shetland

The first digit in the number of any road should be the number of the furthest-anticlockwise zone entered by that road. For example, the A38 road, a trunk road running from Bodmin to Mansfield starts in Zone 3, and is therefore numbered with an A3x number, even though it passes through Zones 4 and 5 to end in Zone 6. Additionally, the A1 in Newcastle upon Tyne has moved twice. Originally along the Great North Road, it then moved to the Tyne Tunnel, causing some of the roads in Zone 1 to lie in Zone 6. The designated A1 later moved to the western bypass around the city, and roads between the two found themselves back in Zone 1. For the most part the roads affected retained their original numbers throughout.

Elsewhere when single-digit roads were bypassed, roads were often re-numbered in keeping with the original zone boundaries.

A few roads are anomalously numbered.

=== Motorways ===

Motorways first came to Britain over three decades after the advent of the A-road numbering event, and as a result required a new numbering system. They were given an M prefix, and in England and Wales a numbering system of their own not coterminous with that of the A-road network, though based on the same principle of zones. Running clockwise from the M1 the zones were defined for Zones 1 to 4 based on the proposed M2, M3 and M4 motorways. The M5 and M6 numbers were reserved for the other two planned long distance motorways. The Preston Bypass, the UK&#x27;s first motorway section, should have been numbered A6(M) under the scheme decided upon, but it was decided to keep the number M6 as had already been applied. The first full-length motorway in the UK was the M1 motorway.

Shorter motorways typically take their numbers from a parent motorway in contravention of the zone system, explaining the apparently anomalous numbers of the M48 and M49 motorways as spurs of the M4, and M271 and M275 motorways as those of the M27.
This numbering system was devised in 1958–59 by the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, and applied only in England and Wales. It was decided to reserve the numbers 7, 8 &amp; 9 for Scotland. In Scotland, where roads were the responsibility of the Scottish Office (Scottish Government after 1999), the decision was taken to adopt a scheme whereby motorways took the numbers of the all-purpose routes they replaced. As a result, there is no M7 (as no motorway follows the A7), and when the A90 was re-routed to replace the A85 south of Perth, the short M85 became part of the M90.

== A roads ==
=== Single-digit A roads ===
In England and Wales, the six single-digit numbers reflect the traditionally most important radial routes coming out of London, Starting with the A1 which heads due north, numbers were allocated sequentially in a clockwise direction, thus:
* A1 London to Edinburgh (also known as the Great North Road), most of the road is bypassed by the M1 and many sections have been upgraded to A1(M).
* A2 London to Dover (the southern part of Watling Street, also known as the Dover Road).
* A3 London to Portsmouth (also known as the Portsmouth Road).
* A4 London to Avonmouth (also known as the Great West Road or the Bath Road), although this route is not used as a long-distance road since the completion of the M4.
* A5 London to Holyhead (the Northern part of Watling Street).
* A6 Luton to Carlisle (The A6 originally started in Barnet on the old A1. When the A1 was moved onto the Barnet Bypass in the 1950s, the A6 was cut back to the A1/A1(M) junction (later A1/M25 junction). Further renumbering in the St Albans area means that it now starts in Luton town centre. The old route is numbered as A1081).

Similarly, in Scotland, important roads radiating from Edinburgh have single-digit numbers, thus:
* A7 Edinburgh to Carlisle, although the M74 and M8 motorways now form the primary link.
* A8 Edinburgh to Greenock, which formerly linked Edinburgh to Glasgow, now has a gap, where it is replaced by the M8.
* A9 Falkirk to Scrabster. Originally Edinburgh to Inverness, the A9 was extended to John o&#x27; Groats via Wick on 16 May 1935, and later cut back at the southern end because of the construction of the main runway at Edinburgh Airport on top of it. As such, the route from Edinburgh is now replaced by the M9 (with the M90 across the Queensferry Crossing as an alternative to Perth). On 1 April 1997, the A9 was diverted to Thurso and Scrabster at the northern end.

While these routes remain the basis for the numbering of the A road network, they are no longer necessarily major roads, having been bypassed by motorways or other changes to the road network.

=== Other A roads ===
These radials are supplemented by two-digit codes which are routes that &quot;may&quot; be slightly less important, but may still be classified as trunk routes, although many of these routes have lost a lot of their significance due to motorway bypasses, or the upgrading of other A-roads (such as the A38 (M)). These routes are not all centred on London, but as far as possible follow the general principle that their number locates them radially clockwise from the associated single digit route. For example, the A10 (London to King&#x27;s Lynn) is the first main route clockwise from the A1, the A11 (London to Norwich) is the next, then the A12 (London to Lowestoft) and the A13 (London to Shoeburyness); the next radial is the A2, followed by the A20 (London to Dover), and so on. These roads have been numbered either outwards from or clockwise around their respective hubs, depending on their alignment.

The system continues to three and four digit numbers which further split and criss-cross the radials. Lower numbers originate closer to London than higher numbered ones. As roads have been improved since the scheme commenced, some roads with 3 or 4 digit numbers have increased in significance, for example the A127, A1079 and A414. New routes have also been allocated 3 or 4 digit numbers, for example the Edinburgh City Bypass is the A720.

The Major Road Network is a proposed classification of major local-authority controlled A roads that the government committed to implementing in 2017, with the aim of better targeting road funding.

=== Lists of A roads ===
*Zone 1 A roads
*Zone 2 A roads
*Zone 3 A roads
*Zone 4 A roads
*Zone 5 A roads
*Zone 6 A roads
*Zone 7 A roads
*Zone 8 A roads
*Zone 9 A roads

=== Trunk roads and primary routes ===

Some A roads are designated trunk roads, which implies that central government rather than local government has responsibility for them. A more recent classification is that of primary routes, the category of recommended routes for long-distance traffic. Primary routes include both trunk and non-trunk roads.

=== Motorway sections ===
Some sections of A roads have been improved to the same standard as motorways, but do not completely replace the existing road; they form a higher standard part of the route for those which are not excluded. These sections retain the same number but are suffixed with (M), for example the A1(M) and A404(M). There have been occasions where this designation has been used to indicate motorway bypasses of an existing road, but the original retains the A road designation, for example A3(M), A329(M), A38(M), A48(M) and A627(M).

== B roads ==

B roads are numbered distributor roads, which have lower traffic densities than the main trunk roads, or A roads. This classification has nothing to do with the width or quality of the physical road, and B roads can range from dual carriageways to single track roads with passing places. B roads follow the same numbering scheme as A roads, but almost always have 3- and 4-digit designations. Many 3-digit B roads outside the London area are former A roads which have been downgraded owing to new road construction; others may link smaller settlements to A roads.

=== B roads in Devon ===
B roads in the county of Devon have further sub-classifications according to their accessibility. This is due to the rural nature of Devon&#x27;s topology making some roads unsuitable for certain types of vehicle.

The classification is denoted by the colour of the sign border and direction arrow, and can be summarised as follows:
* Blue - roads suitable for cars, minibuses and light goods vehicles excluding caravans
* Brown - roads that are only suitable for cars and other light traffic
* White - roads recommended for local traffic only

=== Lists of B roads ===

*Zone 1 B roads
*Zone 2 B roads
*Zone 3 B roads
*Zone 4 B roads
*Zone 5 B roads
*Zone 6 B roads
*Zone 7 B roads
*Zone 8 B roads
*Zone 9 B roads

== Other classifications ==

=== Unclassified roads ===
Roads and lanes with yet lower traffic densities are designated as &quot;unclassified&quot; roads commonly using C, D and U prefixes but, while these are numbered, in general this is done for use by the local authorities who are responsible for maintaining them and the non-unique numbering is in a local series which usually does not appear on road signs; use of local numbers on signs in England is &quot;not advised&quot;. Exceptions to this are known in the forms of numbers on signs and past use of prefixes H and V on signs in Milton Keynes where main roads have a regular grid system. These designations are used when planning officers deal with certain planning applications, including the creation of a new vehicular access onto a highway. The letter Q is used for many important unclassified roads in Fife.

===Cycleways===
In London, Cycleways are using the C prefix and marked using pale green signs. There are also some CS prefixes for Cycle Superhighways, marked using magenta signs, but these are being phased out.

=== E-roads ===
Despite numerous large roads in Great Britain being part of the International E-road network, no road that forms part of this network is signposted as such and only the road&#x27;s national designation is shown. The same is true in Northern Ireland.

<text>Macedon is a town in Wayne County, New York, United States. The population was 9,148 at the 2010 census.

The Town of Macedon is named after the birthplace of Alexander the Great, in Ancient Macedonia. It is located in the southwest corner of Wayne County and contains a hamlet also named Macedon, formerly an incorporated village. The town is east of Rochester and west of Syracuse.

==Etymology==
Macedon took its name from the ancient Greek Kingdom of Macedon. The toponym Macedon is derived itself from the ancient Greek adjective μακεδνός (&quot;makednós&quot;), meaning &quot;tall&quot;, possibly descriptive of the inhabitants of Macedon. It has the same root as the adjective μακρός (&quot;makros&quot;), meaning &quot;long&quot; or &quot;tall&quot; in Ancient Greek. The name is originally believed to have meant either &quot;highlanders&quot;, &quot;the tall ones&quot;, or &quot;high grown men&quot;.

==History==
Prior to early settlement, the area in and around Macedon was home to the Seneca Nation, a tribe member in the Iroquois League.

The town land was acquired for settlement in 1788 from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase. The first settlers, Webb and Hannah Harwood, arrived in 1789.

The construction and completion of the Erie Canal from 1817 to 1825 brought many new settlers to the area. The town of Macedon was incorporated during the canal construction in 1823, from what had been the western half of the Town of Palmyra. The opening of the Erie Canal led to the forming of new port communities like Wayneport and the Village of Macedon, with the latter centered on Lock 30.

Remnants of the former Enlarged Erie Canal Lock 60 (also called the Lower Macedon Lock) are located along the canal trail off Quaker Road, just east of the Village of Macedon. It was built in 1841 as a single-chamber lock, but doubled in 1874. The lock had a lift of to the west. It was abandoned in 1914. The site is currently maintained as a park. Nearby are the remains of Erie Canal Change Bridge #39 (also called Gallup&#x27;s Bridge), located just west of the intersection of O&#x27;Neil and Quaker roads. A change bridge allowed towpaths to switch from one side of the canal to the other. The bridge was constructed in 1881 and had an iron lattice truss with a wooden floor. Only the foundations are still in place.

The Macedon Academy, open from 1841 to 1902, set a standard for education excellence of the era. The academy provided an intermediate level of education, between the district school level and college.

Part of Company B, 160th New York Volunteer Infantry, was raised in Macedon during the American Civil War. At the time, the town had a population of only a little over 2,500.

The J. and E. Baker Cobblestone Farmstead and Charles Bullis House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The town is part of the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor.

Macedon is bordered by the towns of Walworth to the north, Palmyra to the east, Farmington (Ontario County) to the south, and Perinton (Monroe County) to the west.

An East-West auxiliary branch of NY 31, New York State Route 31F and New York State Route 350 intersect east–west New York State Route 31 at Macedon hamlet.

==Demographics==

<text>Palmyra () is a village in Wayne County, New York, United States. The population was 3,536 at the 2010 census. The village, along with the town, is named after Palmyra in present-day Syria.

The village is in the Town of Palmyra. The village is east of Rochester.

==History==

The village was originally called &quot;Swift&#x27;s Landing&quot; after founder John Swift in 1790, and was incorporated as Palmyra in 1827. By 1900, the village had become a railroad and industrial center. Palmyra was a large part of the underground railroad during times of slavery; it is reported to have helped over 2,000 fugitive slaves escape into Canada.

Palmyra claims to be the only city or village in the U.S. to have four churches at a four corner intersection facing each other. It is one of ten places in the world that has four churches on the four corners of two intersecting highways. The &quot;four corners&quot; churches are at the intersection of New York State Route 21 and New York State Route 31.

The Palmyra Village Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. It includes the previously listed Market Street Historic District, East Main Street Commercial Historic District, and Zion Episcopal Church.

Palmyra is part of the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor. Erie Canal Lock 29 is behind Palmyra-Macedon Aqueduct Park, just off N.Y. Route 31. It was built around 1914, and has a lift of 16 feet (4.88 m) to the west. Nearby are the remains of the Palmyra Aqueduct (built 1857), also known as Mud Creek Aqueduct. Before the Erie Canal was re-routed, it crossed the top of aqueduct over Ganargua Creek. The former Erie Canal Change Bridge #35 (also called Aldrich Bridge), is at Palmyra-Macedon Aqueduct Park. A change bridge allowed towpaths to switch from one side of the canal to the other. It was first constructed in 1858. The bridge was sold to a local farm in 1915, but later salvaged after flooding in 1996 and reconstructed eight years later at the park.

===Place in early Latter-Day Saint History===
In 1830 the village was the site of the first publication of the Book of Mormon at the printing press of local publisher E. B. Grandin. Many other events in the early history of the Latter Day Saint movement took place in the village and town. The Book of Mormon Historic Publication Site has been maintained by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since 1978 as a tourist destination and was restored and rededicated in 1998.

===2013 Downtown fire===
On May 3, 2013, a fire started by alleged arson destroyed three historic Main Street buildings dating to the village&#x27;s Erie Canal era, and water from the firefighting response damaged a fourth. The buildings were condemned on May 7 and were demolished that summer. The buildings had survived proposed demolition during the urban renewal era of the 1960s. Business owner Mark Crane rebuilt his &quot;Mark&#x27;s Pizzeria&quot; over several of the building sites, leaving one open for an outdoor seating area.

<text>Palmyra () is a town in southwestern Wayne County, New York, United States. The population was 7,975 at the 2010 census. The town is named after the ancient city Palmyra in Syria.

The town contains a village also named Palmyra. The town is about southeast of Rochester, New York.

==History==
The prehistoric Adena culture left mounds in the area.

Palmyra was part of the Phelps and Gorham Purchase.

The Town of Palmyra, originally called &quot;Swift&#x27;s Landing&quot; after its founder John Swift and &quot;District of Tolland,&quot; was created in 1789. The sole local encounter between natives and white settlers that resulted in deaths occurred that same year. The present name was adopted in 1796, reportedly to impress a new school teacher. There were almost one thousand people in the town in 1800.

The Erie Canal was completed up to Palmyra in 1822, although the canal was not completed to its western terminus until 1825. Palmyra is part of the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor.

In 1823, the Town of Macedon was formed from part of Palmyra&#x27;s territory as part of the creation of Wayne County from Ontario County.

=== Birth of Latter Day Saint movement ===
Palmyra is the birthplace of the Latter Day Saint movement. Founder Joseph Smith, whose family lived on a farm that straddled the line between Palmyra and Manchester, said he had been visited by God and Jesus Christ in 1820, an event known as the First Vision. In 1830 the Book of Mormon was first published in the village of Palmyra by E.B. Grandin, in the present Book of Mormon Historic Publication Site. Beginning in the early 20th century, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began buying and restoring many of the properties in the area associated with early church history. In 1997 the Smiths&#x27; log cabin was rebuilt on its original site and in 2000 the church built the Palmyra New York Temple on a portion of the former Smith farm.

==Geography==

The Erie Canal passes across the county, through the Village of Palmyra. The multi-use, recreational Erie Canal Heritage Trail continues along the towpath of the Erie Canal as well.

The south town line is the border of Ontario County.

New York State Route 21 (north-south) intersects New York State Route 31 (east-west) in Palmyra village.

==Education==
The Palmyra-Macedon High School, Palmyra-Macedon Middle School and Palmyra-Macedon Primary School are all located within Palmyra.

The Palmyra Community Library is a Board of Regents chartered library that serves the public with a collection of books, magazines, videos, audiobooks, video games, and local references that may be borrowed or viewed. The library also hosts a variety of community events year round. Free wireless internet and computer access are available on site.

In 2011, the library moved to its current location in the renovated Garlock Packing Company Building. The move was prompted by a need to expand on site resources, increase seating, and add community gathering spaces.

The village area was part of the Iroquois Confederacy&#x27;s territory. Specifically, this was territory of the Onondaga nation for many years. They camped at lake edge, where they could fish. They hunted in the interior woods. After the American Revolution, in which the Onondagas and most Iroquois tribes had allied with Great Britain, they were forced to cede their lands to New York as part of the peace settlement (Treaty of Fort Stanwix). Migrating with Loyalists after Britain&#x27;s defeat, the tribes relocated to Upper Canada across Lake Ontario, where the British government made some allotments for their reservations.

The first European-American settler arrived at what became Sodus in 1809, as part of the great postwar migration of settlers from New England into western New York. The village was incorporated in 1917.

<text>Sodus is a town in Wayne County, New York, United States. The population was 8,384 at the 2010 census. The town takes its name from a native word for the bay in the eastern part of the town: &quot;Assorodus,&quot; meaning &quot;silvery water.&quot;

The Town of Sodus is on the north border of the county and is midway between Rochester and Syracuse.

==History==

The Town of Sodus was formed in 1789 from the older &quot;District of Sodus&quot; while still part of Ontario County. The town&#x27;s Adam territory was substantially reduced by the formation of newer towns in the county: Williamson (1802) and Lyons (1811).

The town contains a village also named Sodus and another named Sodus Point. Sodus Point was settled around 1794 because of a road constructed from Palmyra, but the first settlers did not arrive at the Village of Sodus until about 1809.

In 1813, the British attacked and burned the village of Sodus Point.

A lighthouse was erected in 1825 to mark the shoreline.

Members of the Shakers settled in the early town, but moved away, when they believed Sodus was becoming too worldly. 
Sodus claims to be the birthplace of Arbor Day, a holiday established by the efforts of Sodus Center native Edward C. Delano.

A Heluva Good! Country Store was located near the hamlet of Wallington. The cheese packaging plant in Sodus and the Heluva Good! Country Store both closed on June 26, 2015. The company is a subsidiary of HP Hood LLC, headquartered in Lynnfield, Massachusetts.

The Preston-Gaylord Cobblestone Farmhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

The northern border of Sodus is Lake Ontario. Sodus Bay, a bay of Lake Ontario is partly in the town.

Sodus is a town on the northern boundary of the United States, and Canada is on the opposite shore of Lake Ontario.

<doc id="260171" wikidata="Q27884" url="?curid=260171" title="Markup (business)">
<text>Markup (or price spread) is the difference between the selling price of a good or service and its cost. It is often expressed as a percentage over the cost. A markup is added into the total cost incurred by the producer of a good or service in order to cover the costs of doing business and create a profit. The total cost reflects the total amount of both fixed and variable expenses to produce and distribute a product. Markup can be expressed as the fixed amount or as a percentage of the total cost or selling price. Retail markup is commonly calculated as the difference between wholesale price and retail price, as a percentage of wholesale. Other methods are also used.

==Price determination==

===Profit===
*Assume: Sale price is 2500, Product cost is 1800
:Profit = Sale price − Cost
:700 = 2500 − 1800

===Markup===
Below shows markup as a percentage of the cost added to the cost to create a new total (i.e. cost plus).

*Cost × (1 + Markup) = Sale price
:or solved for Markup = (Sale price / Cost) − 1
:or solved for Markup = (Sale price − Cost) / Cost

*Assume the sale price is $1.99 and the cost is $1.40
:Markup = ($1.99 / 1.40) − 1 = 42%
:or Markup = ($1.99 − $1.40) / $1.40 = 42%

*To convert from markup to profit margin:
:Sale price − Cost = Sale price × Profit margin
:therefore Profit Margin = (Sale price − Cost) / Sale price
:Margin = 1 − (1 / (Markup + 1))
:or Margin = Markup/(Markup + 1)
:Margin = 1 − (1 / (1 + 0.42)) = 29.5%
:or Margin = ($1.99 − $1.40) / $1.99 = 29.6%

A different method of calculating markup is based on percentage of selling price. This method eliminates the two-step process above and incorporates the ability of discount pricing.

*For instance cost of an item is 75.00 with 25% markup discount.
:75.00/(1 − .25) = 75.00/.75 = 100.00

Comparing the two methods for discounting:
*75.00 × (1 + .25) = 93.75 sale price with a 25% discount
:93.75 × (1 − .25) = 93.75 × .75 = 70.31(25) 
:cost was 75.00 and if sold for 70.31 both the markup and the discount is 25%

*75.00 /(1 − .25) = 100.00 sale price with a 25% discount
:100.00 × (1 − .25) = 100.00 × .75 = 75.00
:cost was 75.00 and if sold for 75.00 both the profit margin and the discount is 25%

These examples show the difference between adding a percentage of a number to a number and asking of what number is this number X% of. If the markup has to include more than just profit, such as overhead, it can be included as such:
*cost × 1.25 = sale price

or

*cost / .75 = sale price

===Aggregate supply framework===
P = (1+μ) W. Where μ is the markup over costs. This is the pricing equation.

W = F(u,z) Pe . This is the wage setting relation. u is unemployment which negatively affects wages and z the catch all variable positively affects wages.

:Sub the wage setting into the price setting to get the aggregate supply curve.

P = Pe(1+μ) F(u,z). This is the aggregate supply curve. Where the price is determined by expected price, unemployment and z the catch all variable.

The first white colonist settlement began around 1807. Native Americans settled the land many years before. 
The Town of Wolcott was formed 1807 from the Town of Junius in Seneca County, New York before the creation of Wayne County, but the town was not completely organized until 1810. The land on which the town was formed on was previously inhabited by Cayuga and Onondaga Native Americans, who were exiled for siding with the British by Revolutionary War troops led by General Anthony Wayne and subsequently displaced by white European colonists, but who have been free to return for well over a century.

The town was later reduced in size by the formation of new towns in the county: Butler, Huron, and Rose, all in 1826.

The discovery of iron ore in the county led to the smelting operation at Wolcott furnace north of Wolcott village from 1821 to 1869.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 40.2 square miles (104.0 km2), of which, 39.3 square miles (101.8 km2) of it is land and 0.9 square miles (2.2 km2) of it (2.14%) is water.

The town&#x27;s north border is Lake Ontario, and the east town line is Cayuga County.

The Clinton Formation of red hematite led to the early iron production industry in the town and county.

<text>Bedford is an incorporated town in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 17,309 at the 2020 census.

Bedford is located in the northeastern part of Westchester County and contains the three hamlets of Bedford Hills, Bedford, and Katonah.

==History==
The town of Bedford was founded on December 23, 1680, when 22 Puritans from Stamford, Connecticut, purchased a tract of land three miles square known as the &quot;Hopp Ground&quot; from Chief Katonah and several other Native Americans for coats, blankets, wampum and cloth.

Bedford was made a part of Connecticut in 1697 when a patent fixed the boundaries as a six-mile square. Only when King William III of England issued a royal decree in 1700 settling a boundary dispute did Bedford become part of New York.

The town served as the county seat of Westchester County during the American Revolutionary War after the Battle of White Plains, until Bedford was burned by the British in July 1779. British forces led by Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton burned the town leaving only one structure standing in the town. After the Revolution, Bedford was made one of two seats of county government, alternating with White Plains, until 1870. Westchester County&#x27;s oldest government building is the Court House in Bedford village, which was built in 1787 and renovated in the 1960s.

Stepping Stones - Historic Home of Bill &amp; Lois Wilson (respective cofounders of Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon Family Groups), Bedford Village Historic District, Caramoor Center for Music and the Arts, Palmer-Lewis Estate and The Woodpile are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 5.70%, is water. The town is bordered to the west by Mount Kisco and the town of New Castle, to the south by Armonk in the town of North Castle, to the north by Lewisboro and to the east by Pound Ridge.

The Cross River Reservoir is situated on the northern portion of the town. The town is part of the Croton River watershed. The northern portion of the Byram Lake Reservoir is situated on the southern limits of the town.

The Mianus River runs throughout the town of Bedford. The northernmost point of the river is also located in the town. The river originates in a series of small ponds in Armonk and flows north into the town of Bedford. The river flows north along Greenwich Road and begins to turn just south of the Bedford Village Town Park before crossing Greenwich Road. The river reaches its northernmost point at the entrance of Middle Patent Road. The river then runs south and enters the Mianus River Gorge Preserve which is located in the town of Bedford. The river flows south through the entirety of the Mianus River Gorge Preserve and eventually leaves the town and enters Stamford, Connecticut.

==Landmarks==
In the hamlet of Katonah are two national historic landmarks, which are &quot;Stepping Stones - Historic Home of Bill &amp; Lois Wilson&quot; (home of the Alcoholics Anonymous co-founders; &quot;Bill W.&quot;, who died in 1971 and &quot;Lois W.&quot;, who died in 1988) and &quot;John Jay Homestead&quot;, home of one of the United States Founding Fathers and first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Some minor landmarks are centered on Bedford Green in the Town of Bedford&#x27;s Hamlet of &quot;Bedford&quot;, a small patch of green space at the center of the Bedford Village Historic District (along Route 22), including the former court house, the oldest government building in Westchester County and now a museum. There is a small graveyard dating back to the founding of the town; the old one-room stone schoolhouse; and a few colonial-era houses, still lived in, which are kept painted white with black or green shutters.
The Bedford Free Library is located in Bedford on the village green. Along with the branches in Bedford Hills and Katonah, the Bedford Free Library is part of the Westchester Library System.

<text>Eastchester is a town in southern Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was over 34,641 at the 2020 United States census over 32,363 at the 2010 census. There are two villages within the town: Bronxville and Tuckahoe. The town contains a census-designated place also named Eastchester, which is the whole town of Eastchester excluding Bronxville and Tuckahoe.

==History==
The town that is now called Eastchester began settlement in 1664 when ten families migrated from Fairfield, Connecticut. Thomas Pell, who at that time also owned the territory that is now New Rochelle and Pelham, granted a deed to the group to &quot;settle down at Hutchinsons&#x27;,&quot; where the home of Anne Hutchinson had stood some twenty years before. The ten original families were shortly joined by another 26.

Laws for the region were established the following year, in 1665, under an agreement called the &quot;Eastchester Covenant&quot;. The covenant was a rare document for this period. It contained 26 provisions, including such items as education of children, disposition and upkeep of property, and support of a minister.

Confirmation of their 1664 land patent was granted by Governor Richard Nicolls in 1666 after the occupation of the area by the English. A controversy arose in 1700 when the settlers signed a deed with the Native Americans. The tract of land involved was known as &quot;Long Reach&quot; because of its odd geographical makeup. The sites included are the present Bronxville, Tuckahoe, and a section of northwest Mount Vernon. The dispute over the ownership of the land involved the towns of New Rochelle, Westchester and the Pell family. When a decision was reached in favor of Eastchester, England&#x27;s Queen Anne granted a second patent in 1708.

Eastchester was a farming community at the outbreak of the American Revolution. Although no major battles were fought here, as the heart of the Neutral Ground it saw constant fighting for over 13 years, being harassed by both sides as well as by the cowboys and skinners (the guerrillas of the day). Eastchester&#x27;s rural makeup began to change with the coming of the railroad in the 1840s. An area of of land was incorporated as the village of Mount Vernon in 1853 by a group of New York businessmen; the village of Bronxville was incorporated in 1898; and the village of Tuckahoe in 1903. Today, Eastchester is bounded by Scarsdale on the north, New Rochelle on the east, Yonkers on the west, and Mount Vernon on the south. The town covers approximately five square miles, including Bronxville and Tuckahoe.

Babe Ruth was a member of Leewood Country Club.

The Marble Schoolhouse and Tuckahoe High School are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1899, the University system of New York State granted a charter to the Waverly Union School, located in present day Eastchester (called Upper Tuckahoe at the time), which housed grades kindergarten through twelve. This charter marks the beginnings of the Eastchester Union Free District. Waverly was the center of the Eastchester educational community, until Eastchester High School was completed in 1927. Waverly continued to serve as an elementary school until 1983. In 1990, it was refurbished and opened as the Waverly Early Childhood Center.
The Wilmot School near the corner of White Plains Road and Wilmot Road was a K-8 school that serviced the north end of town after 1909. When the Greenvale elementary school was erected in 1936, the Wilmot School was converted into Eastchester&#x27;s Town Hall. In 1964, the clubhouse of the Oak Ridge Country Club was converted into the present Town Hall, and the Wilmot School was torn down. The Cooper School, located in the northern end of town, was an elementary school built in the 1920s. It was demolished in 1980 and the land sold to a private housing developer. The original schoolyard lives on as Cooper Field, leased to the town of Eastchester at the rate of one dollar per year. The park is also referred to as Vaccaro Park, as it was originally donated by Carmela Vaccaro the matriarch of one of the largest and longest standing families in Eastchester. The Anne Hutchinson School, another elementary school, was built in 1953, and additional classrooms constructed several years later. A primary wing was built at the Greenvale School in the 1950s.

<text>Mamaroneck is a village in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 18,929 at the 2010 census. , its population was an estimated 19,131. It is located partially within the town of Mamaroneck and partially within the town of Rye. The portion in Rye is unofficially called &quot;Rye Neck&quot;. The Rye Neck Union Free School District contains the Rye Neck portion of Mamaroneck and part of the city of Rye.

==History==
Originally, the farming community of Mamaroneck was located on two sides of the Mamaroneck River. In the 1890s, the two areas surrounding the river were joined into one commercial village, Mamaroneck, which was incorporated in 1895. The eastern side of the village lies in the town of Rye and is known as Rye Neck. Some controversy surrounded the incorporation of the village, but the State Appellate Court approved the village&#x27;s election status. The population of Mamaroneck village in 1895 was 1,500.

Along with the other shore communities of Westchester, Mamaroneck was at one time the location of summer residences for wealthy families from New York City. Summer residence neighborhoods included Greenhaven, Orienta and Shore Acres. The local railroad from New York City (now Metro-North) began to serve the village in 1848. Currently, the village of Mamaroneck is a commuter town for individuals working in Manhattan. A harbor on the Long Island Sound supports facilities for pleasure boating and is the location of Harbor Island Park, a large public park with beach and sporting facilities.

The main commercial streets in Mamaroneck are the Boston Post Road (U.S. Route 1) and Mamaroneck Avenue, the site of several annual parades. Local industry is centered on Fenimore Road.

Other areas of the town include Heathcote Hill, overlooking the harbor, Harbor Heights (the heights) to the northeast, Old Rye Neck (settled in the 1880s), Rye Neck (settled in the 1920s and 1930s), Orienta, and Washingtonville, better known as &quot;The Flats&quot;, due to the flat, low-lying topography of the area.

<text>Mamaroneck ( ), is a town in Westchester County, New York, United States.

The population was 31,758 at the 2020 United States census over 29,156 at the 2010 census. There are two villages contained within the town: Larchmont and the Village of Mamaroneck (part of which is located in the adjacent town of Rye). The majority of the town&#x27;s land area is not within either village, constituting an unincorporated area, although a majority of the population lives within the villages. Legally, the unincorporated section and the villages constitute the town as a political and governmental subdivision of New York State. The town is led by a town board, composed of five town board members, which includes the town supervisor, Jaine Elkind Eney.

Much of the unincorporated section of the town receives its mail via the Larchmont Post Office and thereby has a Larchmont address.

== History ==

The area that is now the town in Mamaroneck was purchased from the Weckquaesgeek Wappaquewam on behalf of Manhatahan &quot;another proprietors&quot; and &quot;by the consent of the other Indians,&quot; on September 23, 1661, by an Englishman named John Richbell who was a resident of Oyster Bay LI.

During the American Revolutionary War in 1776, a British loyalist, William Lounsbery, was attacked and killed by a group of revolutionaries led by John Flood. Several other skirmishes occurred that year between loyalists and revolutionaries.

The New York Legislature created Mamaroneck as a town on March 7, 1788. The Town of Mamaroneck is divided into three parts: the Village of Larchmont, an unincorporated area, and the Village of Mamaroneck, the rest of that village being in the town of Rye.

This three-part division occurred in the 1890s to meet the growing demand for municipal services that the town could not provide. By definition at the time, a town could only provide basic government functions such as organizing and supervising elections, administering judicial functions, and constructing and maintaining highways.

During the 1890s, parts of the town of Mamaroneck that were situated closest to the water thrived. Larchmont Manor, with its beaches along Long Island Sound, had become well known as a summer resort for families from New York City, and people were beginning to live there year-round.

A large part of the town&#x27;s population lived northeast of the Manor near Mamaroneck Harbor, the commercial center of town, where fishing, shipping, and manufacturing could be found. As the population of these two areas expanded, the residents soon found the need for adequate water supply, sewage disposal, garbage collection, sidewalks, and improved street lighting, police and fire protection.

In 1891, residents of Larchmont Manor obtained a charter from the Legislature under which they incorporated their section of town into a village. Four years later, residents of the most developed and populated sections of the towns of Mamaroneck and Rye voted to incorporate as the Village of Mamaroneck.

The Mamaroneck River serves as the boundary separating the towns of Mamaroneck and Rye. While residents of the two villages were now able to receive municipal services, not enough people resided in the unincorporated remainder of the town of Mamaroneck to be included in either village.

In the early 1920s, Mamaroneck was a center of movie‐making. According to the New York Times, &quot;In those days the area was less the “East Coast Hollywood” than Hollywood was “the West Coast Mamaroneck.” The town boasted a distinction to which few communities could lay claim: a silent‐screen‐era movie studio.&quot; A former employee of D.W. Griffith&#x27;s studio on Orienta, said &quot;“In those days we&#x27;d get people like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin visiting. Even Mr. Rockefeller Sr., would come up from the city to see Mr. Griffith at the studio. I&#x27;m not fooling when I say Mamaroneck was more exciting than Hollywood back then.”

After World War I, the unincorporated section of the town grew sufficiently that the State Legislature granted the town government the local powers to provide local services it had previously granted to the villages by charter.

In 1921, the course at Winged Foot Golf Club was constructed and opened in June 1923. The golf club has been host to a number of professional tournaments, including the 1997 PGA Championship and the 1929, 1959, 1974, 1984, 2006, and 2020 U.S. Open.

The Town of Mamaroneck introduced New York&#x27;s first vegetable-oil-powered garbage truck in 2008.

==History==

Frederick Philipse bought the area that presently constitutes the Town of Ossining from the Sint Sinck Indians in 1685. The Sint Sinck are members of the Wappinger Confederacy, who inhabited the land east of Hudson River between what is now Tarrytown and Croton. His manor extended from Spuyten Duyvil Creek on the border between present-day Manhattan and the Bronx to the Croton River. The last Lord of the Manor, Frederick III, was a Loyalist in the American Revolutionary War who fled to England, so the State of New York confiscated the manor in 1779.

In 1838 Benjamin Brandreth built a manufacturing facility for his &quot;Vegetable Universal Pills&quot;, which became one of the most successful patent medicines in the United States. Brandreth&#x27;s firm was at one point the nation&#x27;s leading proprietary advertiser. He was president of the village for many years.

Due to Ossining&#x27;s history, some of its structures are on the National Register of Historic Places, and the downtown shopping area is listed as the Downtown Ossining Historic District. In addition, the Sparta neighborhood has been designated a local historic district. Ossining&#x27;s role in New York&#x27;s heritage has been recognized by its inclusion, as one of only 14 areas, in an Urban Cultural Park System designed to attract visitors to the state. Also on the National Register of Historic Places are the Richard Austin House, Brandreth Pill Factory, First Baptist Church of Ossining, Highland Cottage, St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church and Rectory, and Washington School.

==Etymology==
Until 1901, the village was known as Sing Sing. It changed its name to avoid the stigma of association with Sing Sing Correctional Facility, which is still Ossining&#x27;s largest employer.

==Transportation==

The Ossining train station provides commuter rail service to Grand Central Terminal in New York City or Croton-Harmon and Poughkeepsie via the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line. The Bee-Line Bus System provides bus service to Ossining on routes 11, 13, 14, and 19. NY Waterway also operates a ferry between Ossining and Haverstraw in Rockland County during the rush hours.

No interstate highways exist within Ossining. The closest example of a federal highway that runs through the village is US 9, along Highland Avenue and Albany Post Road. NY 133 begins at US 9, running along Croton Avenue, and NY 134 begins at that road along Dale Avenue. Part of NY 9A, along the Briarcliff–Peekskill Parkway runs through the eastern edge of the village.

==Education==
Ossining has several public schools, operated by Ossining Union Free School District, and three nearby parochial schools. In 2000, Ossining High School was among the United States&#x27; highest performing schools.

Ossining has two nearby college campuses. A Westchester Community College campus exists in Ossining; in nearby Briarcliff Manor, there is also a Pace University campus.

===Ossining Public Library===
The Ossining Public Library, originally chartered in 1893 as the Sing Sing Public Library, serves the residents of the Village and Town of Ossining. The current library collections include 110,000 books, 25,000 non-print items, and 300 newspaper and magazine titles. As a charter member of the 38-member Westchester Library System, the Ossining Public Library offers its patrons access to the more than one million holdings of the other county libraries. A $15.8-million building program was started in 2005 to replace the 1960s-era facility with a new building. The new Ossining Public Library opened in March 2007 and added many new or enhanced services, including over 50 public Internet terminals, a 250-seat theater, an art gallery, and the county&#x27;s first radio frequency (RFID) circulation system.

The main reading room of Ossining&#x27;s library is named in honor of longtime Ossining resident, Pulitzer Prize–winning author John Cheever. When Cheever died, the flags on Ossining&#x27;s public buildings were lowered for 10 days.

==Notable buildings==
Ossining is known as the home of the Sing Sing Correctional Facility, one of the most well-known prisons in America.

Ossining is also the home of the worldwide Maryknoll Catholic missions, as well as the site of the Crotonville Institute, the famous General Electric leadership training facility, founded in 1956.

==In fiction==
In seasons 1–3 of AMC&#x27;s TV series &quot;Mad Men&quot;, Ossining is home to lead character Don Draper and his family. It remains the home of his ex-wife Betty and their children through much of season 4, until they move to Rye.

In FX&#x27;s &quot;The Shield&quot;, transfer to Ossining is offered to an inmate in exchange for testimony, stated as &quot;Safe and sound in Ossining, New York&quot; as opposed to referencing the town&#x27;s original name of Sing Sing which might have jeopardized the deal.

<text>Ossining ( ) is a town located along the Hudson River in Westchester County, New York. The population was 40,061 at the time of the 2020 census. It contains two villages, the Village of Ossining and part of Briarcliff Manor, the rest of which is located in the Town of Mount Pleasant.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (26.43%) is water.

Ossining is bounded on the west by the Hudson River and on the north by the Croton River.

== History ==

In 1685, Frederick Philipse bought the area which presently constitutes the Town of Ossining from the Sint Sinck, a Munsee-speaking Lenape people. His Manor extended from Spuyten Duyvil Creek on the border between present-day Manhattan and the Bronx to the Croton River. The last Lord of the Manor, Frederick Philipse III, was a Loyalist in the American Revolutionary War who fled to England. The State of New York confiscated the manor in 1779.

In 1813, the village of Sing Sing was incorporated. Sing Sing Prison, now known as Sing Sing Correctional Facility, which is a maximum-security prison, opened in 1826. The prison was opened to replace the Newgate Prison, located in New York City. In 1845, the New York State Legislature created a new town out of the northern part of what had been the Town of Mount Pleasant. A local Indian authority suggested the town be named Ossinsing, a different form of the name Sing Sing. One year later the last &quot;s&quot; was removed for ease in pronunciation. In 1901, to prevent confusion of goods made in the village with Sing Sing prison-made items, local officials had the village name changed to Ossining as well.

In 1902 an area southeast of the village of Ossining, then known as Whitson&#x27;s Corners, was incorporated as the village of Briarcliff Manor.

The Jug Tavern and Scarborough Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Pelham is a suburban town in Westchester County, approximately 10 miles northeast of Midtown Manhattan. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 13,078, an increase from the 2010 census. Historically, Pelham was composed of five villages and became known as &quot;the Pelhams&quot;. Pelham currently contains two independently incorporated villages: the Villages of Pelham and Pelham Manor.

Approximately 35 minutes away from Grand Central Terminal by the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line, Pelham is home to many New York City commuters and has an active social community for its residents. The Bronx–Whitestone Bridge is approximately south of the town. It is also northeast of LaGuardia Airport and north of John F. Kennedy International Airport.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of . It is directly north of the New York City borough of the Bronx, and borders Eastchester, New Rochelle, and Mount Vernon.

== History ==

In 1654, Thomas Pell bought the area within the present-day town from the Siwanoy Indians. He named his manor &quot;Pelham&quot; in honor of his tutor, Pelham Burton.

The Town of Pelham was part of Westchester County when it was established by the post-Revolution New York State legislature in 1788. It included all of City Island and present-day Pelham Bay Park east of the Hutchinson River. In 1889, the town was incorporated at its current boundaries. In 1891, the village of Pelham Manor incorporated. In 1896, the village of North Pelham and the village of Pelham incorporated. In 1975, the villages of North Pelham and Pelham merged, forming the present village of Pelham.

The Village of Pelham and the Village of Pelham Manor share several services such as school and recreational activities. There is a grassroots movement to continue the consolidation of services in order to reduce taxes. Given the differences in debt levels, tax rates, population and tax base such a consolidation has been opposed by many Pelham Manor residents. Such a merger is unlikely under current conditions.

For many years after 1916, Pelham was the headquarters of the Sanborn Map Company, which produced Sanborn maps.

The Pelham Picture House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.

The book, &quot;The Haunted History of Pelham, New York&quot;, documents the history of Pelham and the region, including ghost stories.

Pelham Town is within the Pelham Union Free School District.

Pelham is home to four elementary schools (two located in each village), one middle school, and one high school. The elementary schools are Hutchinson, Colonial, Siwanoy, and Prospect Hill. Pelham Middle School and Pelham Memorial High School gather students for all of Pelham. These are all part of the Pelham Union Free School District. There are also several private and religious based schools. Since 1948 (and as of 1997), New York City has paid the district to educate children who live in Bronx Manor, as doing so is less expensive than sending school buses there.

== Religion ==

===St. Catharine&#x27;s Catholic Church===
St. Catharine&#x27;s was originally a mission church of St Gabriel&#x27;s parish in New Rochelle. In July 1896 a frame church was built in the newly incorporated village of Pelham on land donated by Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Farrell. In December 1897 St. Catharine&#x27;s became a separate parish with Rev. Francis P. McNichol as first pastor. A school was established in 1904, staffed by the Sisters of St. Francis. At the end of the school year in 1983 St. Catharine&#x27;s School closed bringing to an end 75 years of Catholic education in the parish. The school building was converted to a Parish Center to provide space for Religious Education classes, parish activities and groups to meet. A new church was dedicated in 1909.

In 1936 W. T. Grant, who owned a chain of five-and-ten cent stores, gave property in Pelham Manor to St. Catharine&#x27;s to serve as a separate “mission”. The mission evolved to become Our Lady of Perpetual Help parish, with its own church building. In 2014 it was announced that the two parishes would merge, with the newer, larger Our Lady of Perpetual Help building designated as the parish church. However, St. Catharine&#x27;s Church in the Village of Pelham was retained as a worship center.

==Transportation==
The Bee-Line Bus System provides bus service to Pelham.

On Amtrak, Pelham is located closest to the New Rochelle station (&quot;NRO&quot;) on the Northeast Corridor. On Metro-North Railroad, the Pelham station is within Fare Zone 12 on the New Haven Line. Pelham is also about 28 minutes from Grand Central Terminal.

<doc id="260184" wikidata="Q1379757" url="?curid=260184" title="Rye, New York">
<text>Rye is a coastal city in Westchester County, New York, United States, located near New York City and within the New York City metropolitan area. It is separate from the Town of Rye, which has more land area than the city. The City of Rye, formerly the Village of Rye, was part of the Town until it received its charter as a city in 1942, making it the youngest city in the State of New York. Its population density for its 5.85 square miles of land is roughly 2,729.76/sq mi.

Rye is notable for its waterfront which covers 60 percent of the city&#x27;s six square miles and is governed by a waterfront act instituted in 1991. Located in the city are two National Historic Landmarks: the Boston Post Road Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1993 and it is the only National Historic Landmark District in all of Westchester County; its centerpiece is the Jay Estate, the childhood home and final resting place of John Jay, a Founding Father and the first Chief Justice of the United States.

Playland, a historic amusement park designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987, is also located in Rye. Playland features one of the oldest wooden roller coasters in the Northeast, the Dragon Coaster.

== History ==
Rye was once a part of Fairfield County, Connecticut, belonging to the Sachem Ponus, of the Ponus Wekuwuhm, Canaan Parish, and was probably named for that chieftain, &quot;Peningoe Neck&quot;.

It was founded in 1660 by three men: Thomas Studwell, Peter Disbrow and John Coe. Later landowners included John Budd and family.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries it was a haven for wealthy Manhattanites who traveled by coach or boat to escape the city heat. Its location on Long Island Sound and numerous beaches also appealed to visitors with more moderate means who gravitated for short stays at cottages and waterfront hotels.

It has an extraordinary inventory of buildings with architectural distinction that help visually articulate specific neighborhoods and districts.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Rye is &quot;situated in the eastern part of central Westchester County on Long Island Sound. The western border of the City generally parallels Beaver Swamp Brook, while the eastern border is formed by Milton Harbor and the Sound. Blind Brook traverses the City from the northwest corner of Rye to Milton Harbor at the southern end.&quot;

===Rock and wetlands===

The geology and hydrology of Rye is characterized by a significant quantity of rock, marshes and wetlands which makes the city both desirably scenic but also challenging for developers.

Rye&#x27;s bedrock is predominantly constituted of Fordham gneiss and Harrison diorite also known as Byram Black granite.

According to Rye&#x27;s 1985 Master Plan, &quot;Rye contains a variety of environmentally significant areas. Numerous tidal and freshwater wetlands are found near the waterfront and brooks. The Milton Harbor area (including the Marshlands Conservancy and Rye Golf Club), Disbrow Park and the Manursing area contain the most extensive wetlands in the City. In addition, substantial areas near the Sound, Milton Harbor, Blind Brook and Beaver Swamp Brook are within the 100 year flood hazard area, and thus subject to potential flooding.&quot; According to the City of Rye, &quot;Considerable acreage of these important natural resources has been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, polluting and other acts inconsistent with the natural uses of such areas. Remaining wetlands are in jeopardy of being lost, despoiled or impaired by such acts contrary to the public safety and welfare.&quot; As a result,
the city has charged itself with the responsibility of &quot;preventing the despoilation and destruction of wetlands and watercourses while taking into account varying ecological, economic, recreational and aesthetic values. Activities that may damage wetlands or watercourses should be located on upland sites in such a manner as not to degrade these systems.&quot;

In 2017, Rye resident and then New York State Senator George Latimer noted that wetlands maps for the area have not been updated in over 20 years 

===Flooding===
Flooding has long been an issue in Rye as in other coastal towns with water coming in from Long Island Sound. The Blind Brook watershed is also a source of that flooding with significant deluges recorded in the neighborhood of Indian Village after four days of rain in October 1975.

Three major weather events in just five years produced catastrophic damage in the town.
* Following major flooding in March 2007, the April 2007 nor&#x27;easter six weeks later left some homes in Rye with over five feet of floodwater.
* In 2011, the after effects of Hurricane Irene in August and Hurricane Maria in September included swelling of Blind Brook and submersion of private and commercial properties including the Rye Nature Center, Indian Village, the Rye High football field, businesses on Purchase Street and homes on Milton and Highland Roads.
* Storm surges from Hurricane Sandy in 2012 resulted in evacuations of many coastal residences and facilities including the Milton firehouse.

The city&#x27;s response to these recurring hazards was to apply for funding through the NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program. Rye received $3,000,000 to safeguard the city against future flooding threats, upgrade its infrastructure for resiliency, identify stormwater mitigation solutions, and protect historic buildings and natural wetlands.

Starting on September 1, 2021, Rye experienced another substantial flooding event. The storm lasted two days and caused significant damage to municipal facilities, businesses and residences. Areas around Indian Village and other sections of the city that had previously flooded during Hurricane Irene were under 8–9 feet of water. Other areas around the town normally not affected by flooding were also affected. Prior to the flooding event, Rye had undergone approximately five inches of rainfall from Hurricane Henri. Two weeks later, the remnants Hurricane Ida dropped another 8–9 inches of rain in the area within a 12-hour period.
Hurricane Ida remnants caused flooding in Rye nearly 10 years to the day from Hurricane Irene.
===Archaeological significance and notable Indigenous sites===
As of 2010, seventy-five percent of the acreage in Rye or the equivalent of 3,954 acres had been determined to be archaeologically sensitive with many Indigenous and First Nations contact sites. At least two villages have been determined to have existed, one on Manursing Island and the other on today&#x27;s Milton Point.

The presence of Indigenous people&#x27;s activities has been noted in numerous locations where implements and bones were unearthed, including an &quot;ancient Indian burial ground, site of the present Playland Casino&quot; together with discoveries of artifacts along the shoreline, pottery, skeletons and relics along Milton Road, Disbrow Park and throughout today&#x27;s Boston Post Road Historic District including Marshlands Conservancy.

The presence of Indigenous people in Rye was more recently documented in a 2012 Phase IA archaeological investigation commissioned by Westchester County in connection with the construction of a bike path along the Playland Parkway in Rye. Within just one mile of the project site, the report noted a dozen archeologically sensitive areas. The publication included supporting data from files in the repositories of NYOPRHP and the NY State Museum; it further highlighted the existence of shell middens, evidence of camp sites and at least two burial grounds. One of these documented sites included the Blind Brook. Additional findings have been made at the Jay Estate in archaeological digs conducted by Dr. Eugene Boesch and submitted to the NY State Cultural Resource Information System (CRIS).

===Neighborhoods===

Complaints about departure from its core mission of “inspiring greater understanding through body, mind, spirit and community” have mired the &quot;nonsectarian spiritual and educational center&quot; in controversy repeatedly since 1996 when the organization&#x27;s $2.2 million endowment was completely depleted.

* Jay Estate – 23 acre park with gardens operated by the Jay Heritage Center. Restoration of the Jay Mansion (1838) overlooking Long Island Sound was an official project of the Save America&#x27;s Treasures Program. The Jay Mansion is the oldest National Historic Landmark (NHL) structure in New York State with a geothermal heating and cooling pump system and the first in Westchester County to have such an energy efficient system. Member site of the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area. It is also listed on Westchester County&#x27;s African American Heritage Trail.

Its wooden roller coaster, the Dragon Coaster, built in 1929, is one of the last roller coaster rides built by engineer Frederick Church that is still operating. The Derby Racer, also built by Church, is one of only three rides of its kind remaining in the world. Glenn Close&#x27;s and Ellen Latzen&#x27;s characters ride the roller coaster in the 1980s thriller film, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;. Airplane Coaster, Church&#x27;s most acclaimed coaster, was removed in 1957. Playland is also the setting for several key scenes in the 1988 comedy film &quot;Big&quot;, starring Tom Hanks

==Government==
===Planning and zoning===
Planning and zoning oversight is vested in several branches of the Rye government including several volunteer staffed committees like the Planning Commission, the Architectural Review Board, the Sustainability Committee, the Conservation Committee and the Landmarks Committee to name a few.

====Master plan (1985)====
The city&#x27;s current Master Plan guides the planning process. Also known as a Comprehensive plan, it was authored 39 years ago with an expectation that it would be updated again in 2000. Attempts to revise the 1985 document with community input as recommended in NY State&#x27;s Statute on Comprehensive Planning were made in 2016 and 2017. The review, which was aimed to reflect current conditions of growth and forecast future changes, was not completed. As of 2018, Rye lagged behind almost all of the 43 municipalities in Westchester County in updating this &quot;serious document&quot;.

Failure to modernize the 1985 Master Plan on that schedule has produced concerns from residents about the lack of community consensus, lack of informed and coordinated regulation of development and the subsequent impacts including increased flooding and a higher than expected volume of teardowns. Other concerns include threats to historical resources, cultural resources, natural resources, sensitive coastal and environmental areas and numerous other negative repercussions on neighborhood character. Previous Master Plans for Rye were created in 1929, 1945, and in 1963.

====Local Waterfront Revitalization Plan (1991)====
Rye is a coastal community with numerous sensitive wetlands and watercourses. In 1991, the City of Rye adopted a comprehensive plan to further regulate land and water usage to protect and preserve these fragile resources.

====Sustainability plan (2013)====
In 2010, spurred by disastrous flooding events in 2007 and other environmental concerns, the Rye Sustainability Committee (RSC) was formed and tasked with creating a plan to inform best environmental and land stewardship practices for the city. A sustainability plan was formally adopted in December 2013

The annual Rye-Harrison football game has been played for more than 80 years and is a top high school football rivalry in Westchester County. Rye High School&#x27;s mascot is the &quot;Garnets&quot; a name given due to the abundance of the precious gem found during the school&#x27;s construction.

<text>Rye is a town in Westchester County, New York, United States. The population was 49,613 at the 2020 United States census over 45,928 at the 2010 census. It is a separate municipality from the city of Rye. The Town of Rye contains two villages – Port Chester and Rye Brook – and the Rye Neck section of the village of Mamaroneck (the remainder of the village of Mamaroneck is in the town of Mamaroneck). Port Chester, Rye Brook and Rye Neck comprise the entire area of the town of Rye.

==History==

The town of Rye has its original roots on Manursing Island. On June 29, 1660, three settlers living in &quot;Grenege&quot; (now known as Greenwich, Connecticut), Thomas Studwell, John Coe, and Peter Disbrow, purchased Manursing Island (called Menussing by the Indians) from the Mohegan Indians. A tract of land lying between the Byram River and Blind Brook was sold by the Indians to Peter Disbrow on May 22, 1661. That year the four men were joined by John Budd, an original settler of Long Island (Southold) and, previously, New Haven. The four men bought additional lands from the Indians on June 2, 1662. The four men are regarded as the founders of Rye. Another settler, John Horton, purchased some additional lands. By 1662, the town of Hastings had 12 proprietors: Thomas Studwell, John Brondig, William Odell, Thomas Applebe, Philip Galpin, Richard Fowler, William Odell, Peter Disbrow, John Coe, Samuel Allen, Thomas Studwell and John Budd. A neighboring town named Hastings was merged into Rye in the 1660s, no later than 1666, as a 1666 sale of house by John Budd to a George Kniffen of Stratford for 37 pounds, ten shillings, was noted as having been conducted &quot;by agreement of the men of Hastings, now called Rye.&quot; (Rye and Hastings are adjacent towns in East Sussex, England.)

Connecticut and New York both claimed the area, but in these early days, the colonists considered themselves to be under the protection of Connecticut. Connecticut formally ceded Rye to New York in 1683 as part of a boundary agreement, cementing the Connecticut Panhandle.

John Budd, who in 1663 was selected by the colonists to be its representative to the government of Connecticut, had purchased a large portion of land west of Blind Brook, an area called Apawquammis by the Indians, for the sum of eighty pounds sterling on November 8, 1661, one of three major land purchases by Budd from the Indians in the area that month. In 1666, Budd purchased yet another large parcel. By this time, other colonists had grown concerned at the size of Budd&#x27;s holdings, and Budd&#x27;s willingness to &quot;settle people upon it&quot;, which they regarded as &quot;extreamely prejuditial to the towne&quot; of Rye. On October 2, 1668, nine inhabitants of Rye, apparently led by Peter Disbrow, petitioned the governor in Hartford to force Budd to sell some of his holdings to them. The petition failed, and Budd continued selling tracts to new settlers, as did his descendants. One such sale, in 1745, of was from another John Budd, a grandson of the founder, to Peter Jay, father of John Jay, subsequently the president of the Continental Congress, co-author with Alexander Hamilton and James Madison of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, and Chief Justice of the United States, among other major distinctions.

The town grew and developed Poningo Neck, the current business district of the city of Rye, and finally the Saw Pit area, known today as Port Chester. Original roads, including the Post Road, King Street, and Grace Church Street, are some of the oldest roads, then carriage paths, that led residents in and out of the area.

The Rye Town Park-Bathing Complex and Oakland Beach, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003, is located in city of Rye but is accessible for residents of the town and its villages.

<text>Tiverton is a town in Newport County, Rhode Island, United States. The population was 16,359 at the 2020 census.

== Geography ==
Tiverton is located on the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay, across the Sakonnet River from Aquidneck Island (also known as the Island of Rhode Island). Together with the adjacent town of Little Compton, the area is disconnected from the rest of the state of Rhode Island. The northern portion of the town is located on Mount Hope Bay.

Much of the town is located along a granite ridge which runs in a north–south direction, rising approximately 170 feet in elevation from the bay. A large section of exposed granite can be observed at the highway cut for Route 24, near the Main Road interchange.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Tiverton has a total area of , of which is land and ; 19.16%) is water.

The northern portion of greater Tiverton is also known as North Tiverton.

At times, Tiverton has been considered a part of the South Coast region of Massachusetts despite the town residing entirely within Rhode Island. By its most literal definition, the South Coast encompasses the geographic area of Massachusetts that borders Buzzards Bay (excluding the Elizabeth Islands, Bourne and Falmouth), Mount Hope Bay and the Sakonnet River. It has been argued that Little Compton and Tiverton share more in common with the regional identities of the South Coast communities of Westport, Dartmouth and Fall River than the rest of Newport County.

== History ==
===Early===
Tiverton was incorporated by English colonists in 1694 within Bristol County in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. As well as being part of Old Dartmouth. In 1746, in the final settlement of a long colonial boundary dispute between Rhode Island and Massachusetts, Tiverton—together with its fellow towns along the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay, Barrington, Bristol and Little Compton, and the town of Cumberland, to the north of Providence—were annexed to Rhode Island by Royal Decree. Tiverton was incorporated as a town in 1747. Until that year, Tiverton also controlled the area of East Freetown, Massachusetts, as an outpost. The boundary settlement of 1746 had put East Freetown in Massachusetts, and in 1747 it was purchased by Freetown.

Men from the Tiverton outpost took part in the Battle of Freetown, on May 25, 1778, during the Revolutionary War. On the 31st of that month, a party of about 150 British regulars of the 22nd Regiment under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell attacked the town. &quot;Rivington&#x27;s Gazette &quot;reported that the British were making a preemptive attack based on intelligence that the American militia at Tiverton was preparing an attack against them. However, another report in the &quot;New Hampshire Gazette&quot; stated the militia was waiting in prepared defensive positions. The result of this skirmish was two British killed, several more wounded, and some fire damage to the lower mill in Tiverton. None of the militiamen were wounded or killed.

For about three years during the war, December 1776 – October 1779, the island of Rhode Island, now known as Aquidneck Island, was occupied by the British. During this time, Tiverton was a refuge for Americans fleeing this occupation, and a mustering place for colonial forces gathering to drive out the British. The British occupying forces were eventually withdrawn strategically, as General Clinton marshaled his forces for the 1780 British invasion of South Carolina.)

In its early days, Tiverton was chiefly a farming community with some fishing and boat construction. Until 1900 the manufacture of menhaden oil, a fish derivative, was one of the primary industrial pursuits. Cotton and woolen mills were established as early as 1811, when Colonel Joseph Durfee established a spinning mill at Cook Pond, in what it now the city of Fall River, Massachusetts.

In 1856, the northern part of the town was set apart from Tiverton, and renamed Fall River, Rhode Island, by the Rhode Island General Assembly. On March 1, 1862, in a case between the states that reached the United States Supreme Court, both Fall Rivers were made part of Massachusetts and the state boundary was placed in its current location near State Avenue.

Mark&#x27;s Stadium is a former soccer stadium located in North Tiverton, Rhode Island. During the 1920s and early 1930s, it was the home of Fall River F.C., one of the era&#x27;s most successful soccer teams. It is one of the earliest examples of a soccer-specific stadium in the United States. After the demise of the &#x27;Marksmen&#x27;, the stadium was used as a home ground by other local teams, most notably Fall River F.C. (1932) and Ponta Delgada S.C.

===Recent events===
In July 1997 the National Weather Service (NWS) based in Taunton, Massachusetts established a cooperative weather station in the Stone Bridge Village section of town. Named Tiverton-2SW, this station serves as an official meteorological recording station for the town of Tiverton. Data from Tiverton-2SW is collected by the NWS in Taunton, Massachusetts as well as the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina.

As of 2006, retail shops are the major employers in the town. Since the mid-20th century, Tiverton has grown as a summer resort and residential area, and as a suburb of Fall River, Massachusetts. During the 1960s, Route 24 was constructed through the northern part of the town, connecting Tiverton with Newport, Rhode Island via the Sakonnet River Bridge.

In 2002, contaminated soil, including some soil that was blue, was discovered in the Bay Street neighborhood of Tiverton. In 2003, private property testing began. Contaminants including arsenic, lead, cyanide, and more were found at levels above residential exposure guidelines. Residents have been prohibited from digging in the soil. ENACT (Environmental Neighborhood Awareness Committee of Tiverton) advocates on behalf of the community. Property values in the neighborhood have plummeted due to the contamination and the moratorium on digging soil, which meant that residents of this neighborhood have lost their home equity. One of ENACT&#x27;s successes has been the passage of legislation to create the Environmentally Contaminated Home Ownership (ECHO) loan program, which provides loans for people whose home equity has been sharply reduced due to contamination. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) has been involved in developing work plans to treat the contamination.

On September 1, 2018, the Tiverton Casino Hotel (now Bally&#x27;s Tiverton) was opened to the public, after Twin River Worldwide Holdings closed the Newport Grand Casino and moved its gaming license to the new facility.

=== Beaches ===
The two beaches in Tiverton are Fogland Beach and Grinnell&#x27;s Beach. Both beaches are located on the Sakonnet River. Strong cool breezes blow throughout the year.

Fogland Beach has lifeguards, and also can be used for fishing, walking, and wildlife/nature observation. It is popular destination for windsurfing and kite-surfing with rentals being available. The town also offers kayaking and paddleboarding programs through a local company.

Grinnell&#x27;s Beach provides an excellent windsurfing area, and a view of the Sakonnet River and Portsmouth shoreline. Amenities include changing rooms, showers and shaded seating.

In June 2015 a new 24,000 square foot building was opened, incorporating a meeting hall, teen room, cafe, children&#x27;s library, and public courtyard spaces. The new building, designed by Union Studio architects, features a clock tower and gabled ends. The new library received an AIA Rhode Island Design Award for Merit in 2018.

A branch, the Union Public Library located at 3832 Main Road and part of the Tiverton Four Corners Historic District, has operated on that site almost continuously since 1820, although the current Early Victorian building dates from 1868. A paid staff member is assisted by volunteers from the Union Public Library Association to provide a reading room and library services.

<text>Westerly is a town on the southwestern coastline of Washington County, Rhode Island, United States, first settled by English colonists in 1661, and incorporated as a municipality in 1669. The Town of Westerly is a beachfront community on the south shore of the state with a population of 23,359 as of the 2020 census. The western and northern borders of Westerly are defined by a natural border of the Pawcatuck River, with the bordering town of Hopkinton defined by the Pawcatuck River, while holding a straight border to the east with Charlestown.

The Pawcatuck River flows on the western border of Westerly, and was once renowned for its own species of Westerly salmon, three of which are displayed on the town&#x27;s official seal. The Pawcatuck River flows from inland, emptying into Little Narragansett Bay. It also serves as the boundary between Westerly and Pawcatuck, Connecticut. Three large salt ponds lie along the coast, with sand bars of white sand such as the Misquamicut State Beach. From west to east, these ponds are Maschaug Pond, Winnapaug Pond, and Quonochontaug Pond.

Westerly becomes a notable tourist destination during the summer months when the population nearly doubles. Its well-known beaches include Weekapaug Beach, Westerly Town Beach, Misquamicut State Beach, East Beach, and Watch Hill Beach. The Town of Westerly was known historically for local important granite mining and stone-cutting industry, which ran until the quarries stopped operating in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;seewesterly/flagship&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Early History and European settlement ===
It is believed that Aboriginal people arrived in Rhode Island 5,000 years ago, based on sites located in what is now Washington County. Westerly would be known as Misquamicut, home to the Narragansett people up until 1637, when the English had build an outpost, forcing the Narragansett people out of the region by 1661, allowing for the permanent settlement on the coast line. The English village was the home of Elder John Crandall (–1676), one of Westerly&#x27;s founding fathers. Crandall settled in Westerly in 1661, and the early history of Westerly contains many references to him and his sons.

The Town of Westerly was founded on May 13, 1669 on the eastern shore of Pawcatuck River. There was no defined border between Connecticut and Rhode Island until 1720. It is believed that Westerly was named for the settlement&#x27;s location respective to Rhode Island&#x27;s geography, being the westernmost town in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. On May 18, 1669, the newly founded Town of Westerly in the southwest portion of the colony would host its first official town meeting with four elected officers to manage the town, alongside a town clerk.

In 1738, the Town of Charlestown was partitioned off from Westerly, encompassing modern day land of both Charlestown and Richmond, while Hopkinton would remain a part of the Town of Westerly until being partitioned off 19 years later as its own town. Bradford, a village built in 1732, following the partition of Hopkinton, would remain shared between both Hopkinton and Westerly with the Bradford Village Historic District. slavery had existed in the small town of Westerly by the wealthy.

=== Revolutionary War and Post-revolution ===

Physician, American Revolution general, and Rhode Island Supreme Court justice Dr. Joshua Babcock was born in Westerly. Rhode Island Governor and Chief Justice Samuel Ward also lived here for many years. During the American Revolution, Westerly did not play any major battles compared to the nearby Battle of Newport, which happened in Rhode Island. Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Ward Jr was a resident of Westerly, Rhode Island, commanding the 1st Rhode Island Regiment in the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778.

Slavery became illegal in the new State of Rhode Island in the 1770s to 1780s, with in 1784, the State of Rhode Island passed the Gradual Emancipation Act, stating: “children born to slave mothers were to be considered freeborn citizens.&quot; However, children of former slaves were forced to work as apprentices until the age of 21, and their earning given to their mothers’ owners.

In the early 1800s, prior to the War of 1812, Westerly had become a shipbuilding center under U.S. Navy Officer Oliver Perry, having built Gunboats.
In 1834, the Crumb Quarry, began operations, the first quarry in Westerly, to produce Westerly White and Blue granite.&lt;ref name=&quot;ssBh/smith-granite&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Westerly area was known for its historically important (1870-1950s) granite mining&lt;ref name=&quot;b-sHm/companies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and stone-cutting industry, which quarried a unique stone known as Westerly granite.&lt;ref name=&quot;b-sHm/granite&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This pinkish granite has been used in buildings in several states on the eastern seaboard. Its quarries produced blue granite, in addition to pinks and reds. The Smith Granite Company employed many granite cutting craftsmen and was one of the town&#x27;s major employers until the quarries stopped operating in the 1950s. Hundreds of examples of their work can be seen on the battlefields of Gettysburg and in city squares, municipal buildings, cemeteries throughout the United States, and even the Georgia State Capitol.

The four trolley lines of the Groton and Stonington Street Railway, Norwich and Westerly Railway, Pawtucket Valley Street Railway, and the Ashaway and Westerly Railway converged in Westerly and shared track between the railroad station and Dixon House Square downtown. The lines were built in the 1890s and 1900s and ran until the 1920s.

===20th Century===
In 1912, the Westerly Town Hall and Courthouse was built, designed by William Walker &amp; Son in the Academic Revival style, replacing the old town hall. Following the new town halls creation, the district of Pleasant View would be renamed to the Misquamicut in 1928, the original native name of the Westerly region, nearly 260 years after the Town of Westerly was founded. Following the creation of the new town hall, a grass strip would be built by the United States Navy in the 1920s, but would not be activated as an registered airport until the 1930s, when it was registered Westerly State Airport in December of 1939 by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, which would become one of one of six airports managed by the RIAC. The airport continued to serve under the U.S. Navy, allowing for practicing ariel war maneuvers, serving into the 1940s during World War II. On August 2, 1945, a Grumman F6F Hellcat piloted by Ensign Walter G. Davies took off from Runway 32 at the Westerly Auxiliary Naval Air Station, but lost all power and flipped on the runway during emergency landing. The aircraft was deemed a total loss, but there were no injuries or fatalities. 

Westerly in 1938 would be struck by the 1938 New England Hurricane, causing severe damage, with the village of Napatree Point being completely destroyed, with buildings being sent into Little Narragansett Bay, and Sandy Point being disconnected from the rest of Napatree to where it remains today. Misquamicut, Galilee, Jerusalem, Green Hill, and Quonochontaug being heavily destroyed, and a storm surge of 12 to 15ft tall along the coast of Rhode Island. Many factories, mines, houses, and more structures collapsed during the hurricane, and the New Haven and Hartford Railroad was damaged, shutting down transport to Westerly, RI. Following this, Westerly would be struck again 6 years later in 1944, and again in 1954 by major hurricanes. 

In 1966, the Guild Guitar Company, founded in 1952 by Alfred Dronge in New York City, moved production to Westerly, and continued to make their well-respected archtop, acoustic, and solid body guitars there. The Westerly Town Charter, which approved the right to maintain and preserve self-government to the Town of Westerly was approved by the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations on November 5, 1968, and become effective July 1, 1969.

On November 7, 1977, the Potter Hill Mill on the Pawtucket River had caught fire. Built in 1843, Mill had units from Ashaway, Rhode Island being the first to respond, and then Westerly Fire Department arrival. The mill was significantly damaged leading to its collapse, with 75 units on scene, and no injuries reported. Many years following this incident in 2020, the Town of Westerly was given $100,000 in a grant from the NOAA Restoration Center, matched by the Town of Westerly, and other sources, to study fish migration improvements, and flood mitigation improvement, continuing into 2024 with Westerly stating on the town website: &quot;Addressing the dam and the old mill building will eliminate public safety hazards and significantly increase recreation for the community.&quot;

=== 21st Century ===
In 2012, Hurricane Sandy left beaches along the Westerly shoreline devastated and nearly unrecognizable, including Misquamicut. Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee stated that Misquamicut, a village of Westerly Rhode Island, was the New Jersey of Rhode Island, referring to the amount of damage that was received in the State of New Jersey, to the amount of damage received by Misquamicut. The damages caused by Hurricane Sandy caused $11.3 million in damages, with almost 100,000 power outages reported in Rhode Island. 

In December of 2019, a shooting happened at the Babcock Village, in which three women ended up shot. The police identified the shooter, and two surviving victims. The shooting was done by 66-year old Joseph Giachello, who was found dead in his room after taking the life of 47-year old Julie Cardinal, the manager of the complex. During this shooting, all the schools in Westerly managed by Westerly Public Schools were put into lockdown, although Westerly Public Schools stated: “there is no verifiable threat to any of the buildings.”

==== The Covid Pandemic (2020-2023) ====

==History==
The village of Middlebury grew as one of Addison County&#x27;s early industrial centers, due to the presence of a significant waterfall on Otter Creek. The area around the falls developed as the center of industry, with mills lining the river in the Frog Hollow area (Mill Street), where the 1840 Stone Mill is one of the only survivors of that past. It also became a major stop on north–south stagecoach routes, running between Burlington and Rutland. The town green is located directly on this historic route (now United States Route 7), and features important examples of civic and religious architecture. The local Congregational Church, built 1806–09, is the oldest in the county, and is a fine example of Federal period architecture. Also impressive are the Middlebury Inn, built 1826 and restyled later in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Middlebury College was founded in 1800, and its campus is located just southwest of the village center. Another important educational milestone was the 1814 founding by Emma Willard of a private school for women, located in her house on South Main Street.
