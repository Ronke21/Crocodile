<text>Middlebury is the shire town (county seat) of Addison County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,152. Middlebury is home to Middlebury College and the Henry Sheldon Museum of Vermont History and the adjacent hardware store. 

==History==

One of the New Hampshire Grants, Middlebury was chartered by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth on November 2, 1761. The name &quot;Middlebury&quot; came from its location between the towns of Salisbury and New Haven. It was awarded to John Evarts and 62 others. The French and Indian Wars ended in 1763; the first settlers arrived in 1766. John Chipman was the first to clear his land, Lot Seven. During the Revolutionary War, much of the town was burned in Carleton&#x27;s Raid on November 6, 1778. After the war concluded in 1783, settlers returned to rebuild homes, clear forests and establish farms. The principal crops were grains and hay.
Landowners vied for the lucrative honor of having the village center grow on their properties. A survey dispute with Salisbury led to the forfeiture of Gamaliel Painter&#x27;s farm to that town, and his transition from farming to developing Middlebury Village near his and Abisha Washburn&#x27;s mill, together with other mills that surrounded the Otter Creek falls. Industries would include a cotton factory, sawmill, gristmill, pail factory, paper mill, woolen factory, iron foundry, and marble quarry. The Rutland &amp; Burlington Railroad first arrived on September 1, 1849. Around 1830, Middlebury was the second-largest town in Vermont.

Middlebury College, one of the United States&#x27; elite liberal arts colleges, was founded in 1800. It is a member of the NESCAC. In the summer, the town plays host to the annual Middlebury College Language Schools, as well as the college&#x27;s Bread Loaf Writers&#x27; Conference, the oldest surviving conference of its kind in the nation.

On January 2, 1838, a group of &quot;Patriote&quot; refugees from the Lower Canada Rebellion met in Middlebury to plan their future course of action. It was attended by two major &quot;Patriote&quot; leaders, Louis-Joseph Papineau and Robert Nelson, but they were not able to agree on a unified plan.

On October 22, 2007, central Middlebury was evacuated for a short time because of a train derailment; the Middlebury Union Middle School served as the evacuation headquarters.

Today, as the largest town by population in Addison County, Middlebury serves as the commercial and business center for the region. Downtown hosts a three-screen movie theater, the post office, and two historic inns, as well as many shops and restaurants. There is considerable development along U.S. Route 7 heading south of town, including two supermarkets, two drugstores, most of the town&#x27;s gas stations, and several fast-food spots. Of note is Middlebury&#x27;s A&amp;W, Vermont&#x27;s only remaining car-hop restaurant and a popular spot with both locals and Middlebury College students.

==Geography==
Middlebury is located near the center of Addison County in western Vermont. The town is drained by Otter Creek, which flows from south to north along the western edge of the town, with the falls at the center of the village. The Middlebury River flows west to Otter Creek out of the mountains. Chipman Hill, a hill of glacial till, rises above the village just to the northeast. Foothills of the Green Mountains border the town to the east, with the Champlain Valley to the west.

Middlebury is crossed by U.S. Route 7, Vermont Route 23, Vermont Route 30, Vermont Route 116, and Vermont Route 125. It is bordered by the towns of New Haven and Bristol to the north, Ripton to the east, Cornwall and Weybridge to the west, and Salisbury to the south. A new bridge over Otter Creek connecting Cross Street to Bakery Lane opened in November 2010 to serve as a shortcut and alleviate traffic through downtown. The village of East Middlebury is located in the southern part of the town, east of U.S. Route 7.

<text>Arlington is a town in Bennington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,457 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The town of Arlington was chartered July 28, 1761, by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth, as part of the New Hampshire Grants. In 1777, Arlington became the first capital of the Vermont Republic.

Among the first settlers in Arlington were Captain Jehiel Hawley and his family, who had settled there by 1764. They were Anglicans and had fled Roxbury, Connecticut, because of the oppressive requirements of the established Congregational church. At a Proprietor&#x27;s meeting in 1764, the town voted to give of land to any man who would set up a gristmill in what is now East Arlington. This offer was accepted by Remember Baker (first cousin of Ethan Allen), who built a grist and sawmill.

In the years leading up to the American Revolution, both New York and New Hampshire laid claim to lands comprising current-day Vermont. The Province of New York began to grant land in 1765, lagging New Hampshire by four years. Arlington was, for the most part, settled by Anglicans from Roxbury, Newtown, and Milford, Connecticut, with ownership rights derived from the New Hampshire Grants.

When settlers with New York grants arrived, conflicts ensued. Among other things, the residents of Arlington relied on the militancy of Ethan Allen to discourage those touting New York grants. Ethan Allen and his group were known by their friends as the Green Mountain Boys. They were relatively effective in promoting the cause of New Hampshire grantees, although legal ownership was not settled monetarily for many years.

Several members of the Green Mountain Boys lived in Arlington before the American Revolution, including Thomas Chittenden, Seth Warner and Remember Baker, who was the first town clerk. Gideon Hard, a congressman from New York, was born in Arlington. During the American Revolutionary War, the Patriot soldiers of the Green Mountain Boys rallied against Loyalist opposition in the town. British Loyalist citizens in Arlington, united under the leadership of Dr. Samuel Adams, organized an independent military unit, Adams&#x27; Rangers, to support the British war effort in the region. In 1777, Adams&#x27; men saw action, fighting for British General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga in the Province of New York and were soundly defeated.

<text>Bennington is a town in Bennington County, Vermont, United States. It is one of two shire towns (county seats) of the county, the other being Manchester. As of the 2020 US Census, the population was 15,333. Bennington is the most populous town in southern Vermont, the second-largest town in Vermont (after Colchester) and the sixth-largest municipality in the state.

The town is home to the Bennington Battle Monument, which is the tallest human-made structure in the state of Vermont. The town has a long history of manufacturing, primarily within wood processing. The town is also recognized nationally for its pottery, iron, and textiles.

==History==

First of the New Hampshire Grants, Bennington was chartered on January 3, 1749, by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth and named in his honor. It was granted to William Williams and 61 others, mostly from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, making the town the oldest to be chartered in Vermont and outside of what is now New Hampshire, though Brattleboro had been settled earlier as a fort. The town was first settled in 1761 by four families from Hardwick and two from Amherst, Massachusetts. They were led by Capt. Samuel Robinson, who camped in the river valley on his return from the French and Indian War.

Prior to the arrival of colonists, the land belonged to the Western Abenaki of the Wabanaki Confederacy. These peoples were indigenous to Ndakinna—most of what is now northern New England, southern Quebec, and the southern Canadian Maritimes.

There are three historic districts within the town today: Old Bennington, Downtown Bennington and North Bennington. Of these, Old Bennington is the original settlement, dating back to 1761, when Congregational Separatists arrived from Connecticut and from Amherst and Hardwick, Massachusetts. In the early 1800s, Downtown Bennington started developing, and by 1854 the county&#x27;s population had reached 18,589.

===Battle of Bennington===

The town is known in particular for the Battle of Bennington, which took place during the Revolutionary War. Although the battle took place approximately to the west in what is now the state of New York, an ammunition storage building located in Bennington was an important strategic target. On August 16, 1777, Gen. John Stark&#x27;s 1,500-strong New Hampshire Militia defeated 800 German (Hessian) mercenaries, local Loyalists, Canadians and Indians under the command of German Lt. Col. Friedrich Baum. German reinforcements under the command of Lt. Col. Heinrich von Breymann looked set to reverse the outcome, but were prevented by the arrival of Seth Warner&#x27;s Green Mountain Boys, the Vermont militia founded by Ethan Allen.

In 1891, the Bennington Battle Monument was opened. The monument is a stone obelisk that is the tallest human-made structure in Vermont. It is a popular tourist attraction.

==Geography==
Bennington is located in southwestern Bennington County at .

To the west is New York State; Pownal is to the south; Shaftsbury is to the north; and Woodford is to the east.

Located in the southwesternmost portion of Vermont, it is geographically closer to the capital cities of Albany, New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Concord, New Hampshire than to its own state capital, Montpelier.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.59%, is water. Bennington is drained by the Walloomsac River and its tributaries, flowing to the Hoosic and then the Hudson River. The town is located along the western edge of the Green Mountains, including Bald Mountain, which occupies the northeastern edge of town. (Its summit is just over the town line in Woodford.) In the southwest part of town is Mount Anthony, part of the Taconic Range.

===Climate===

Bennington experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and warm to hot, humid summers. Snowfall can vary greatly from year to year. The town can experience snowfall as early as October and as late as April, and the surrounding high country can receive snow as late as May. Nor&#x27;easters, accompanied by high winds, often dump heavy snow on the town during the winter, and accumulations of one foot of snow or greater are not uncommon when these storms move through the area. One such storm dumped very wet, heavy snow on October 4, 1987, catching many residents off guard, because it occurred quite early in that year&#x27;s fall season. The storm resulted in many downed trees and power lines, due in part to that year&#x27;s fall foliage still being intact. Abundant sunshine, along with heavy showers and thunderstorms, are frequent during the summer months. Although tornadoes seldom occur there, an F2 tornado did hit North Bennington on May 31, 1998, during an extremely rare tornado outbreak in the region.

The record high is , reached on July 6, 1931; July 24, 1933; August 15 and 24, 1947; August 27, 1948; and July 18, 1953. The record low is , set on January 31, 1948. July is typically the wettest month, and February the driest.

Bennington lies in USDA plant hardiness zone 5a.

===Big box bylaw===
In January 2005, the Select Board proposed a big box bylaw, primarily in response to Wal-Mart&#x27;s plans to raze its existing outlet and replace it with a Supercenter. The potential negative impact on the town&#x27;s local economy, the low wages paid by Wal-Mart to its employees, and controversies associated with Wal-Mart in general were cited as reasons in support of the bylaw. The bylaw called for a cap on big box stores. In addition, any retailer wishing to build a store greater than of aggregate store space would be required to submit and pay for an evaluation known as a Community Impact Study to the Select Board for approval. Residents voted against the initial proposal in April 2005. However, the Select Board passed a new bylaw on August 1, 2005, that went into effect August 22.

<text>Manchester is an incorporated village in the town of Manchester, Bennington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 783 at the 2020 census.

The village center, located in the vicinity of Vermont Route 7A, Union Street and Taconic Avenue, was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Manchester Village Historic District in 1984.

==History==
Manchester Village was first settled in 1761. Through the middle of the 19th century, Manchester was primarily a crossroads village and the site of several taverns and inns. The village&#x27;s first inn was built in 1769 on the property that is now the site of the Equinox House. Settlement was slow until after the American Revolutionary War, when the area received an influx of settlers, as Vermont temporarily became the fastest growing U.S. state. In the 19th century, the village was overtaken in economic importance by the growth of Manchester Center, and the village was developed and promoted by Charles F. Orvis (founder of the Orvis mail-order business, still based in Manchester) as a summer resort destination for New Yorkers. The village is one of the first places in New England that was promoted and developed as a summer resort community.

==Geography==

<text>Manchester is a town in, and one of two shire towns (county seats) of, Bennington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 4,484 at the 2020 census.

Manchester Village, an incorporated village, and Manchester Center, are settlement centers within the town. Manchester has become a tourist destination, especially for those from New York and Connecticut, offering visitors factory outlet stores of national chain retailers as well as many locally owned businesses and restaurants.

==History==
The town was one of several chartered in 1761 by Benning Wentworth, colonial governor of New Hampshire. It was his custom to name new towns after prominent English aristocrats of the day, hoping they might adopt a patronly interest in their namesakes. Wentworth named Manchester for Robert Montagu, 3rd Duke of Manchester. First settled in 1764, the town was laid out in 1784. The land was better suited for grazing than tillage, so by 1839 about 6,000 sheep roamed the pastures and hillsides.

Other industries came to include iron mines, marble quarries and mills, and lumber companies. The arrival of the railroad from industrialized centers like New York City brought tourists, drawn by Manchester&#x27;s historic architecture and beautiful setting among mountains. Following the Civil War, the town developed into an affluent resort area, which it remains today.

Between 1812 and 1819, Manchester was made famous by the Boorn–Colvin case, called &quot;America&#x27;s first wrongful conviction murder case&quot;, the subject of several books and still studied today.

Orvis is a family-owned retail and mail-order business specializing in high-end fly fishing, hunting and sporting goods. Founded in Manchester in 1856 by Charles F. Orvis to sell fishing tackle, it is the oldest mail-order retailer in the United States.

Jake Burton Carpenter, founder of Burton Snowboards, perfected snowboard design in his garage in Manchester. The company operated out of Manchester until 1992, when it relocated to Burlington. Nearby Stratton Mountain was among the first ski resorts to allow snowboarding.

The town has three distinct state-recognized historic districts—the Depot district located on Highland Avenue and Elm Street, Bonnet Street, just north of Main Street, and Main Street itself.

==Geography==
Manchester is located in north-central Bennington County, lying between the Green Mountains to the east and the Taconic Range to the west. Equinox Mountain, the highest summit in the Taconics, with an elevation of , is in the western part of the town. Manchester is drained by the Batten Kill, Lye Brook, Munson Brook, Bromley Brook, and Bourn Brook. The Lye Brook Falls Hiking Trail, which leads to one of the highest waterfalls in Vermont, is a popular local attraction.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.29%, is water.

Of all households 30.5% were made up of individuals, and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.26 and the average family size was 2.81.

The population distribution by age for Manchester was 23.1% under the age of 18, 4.0% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 28.8% from 45 to 64, and 19.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 87.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.3 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $47,196, and the median income for a family was $59,191. Males had a median income of $36,453 versus $26,017 for females.

==Transportation==
Manchester is crossed by four highways, including one Super-2 freeway. They are:

* U.S. Route 7 (Exit 4 serves the town)
* Historic VT Route 7A
* Vermont Route 30
* Vermont Route 11
Green Mountain Community Network&#x27;s Orange Line bus and MVRTD &quot;The Bus&quot; Manchester-Rutland Connector serve the town with public transit commuter connections to Bennington and Rutland, respectively. The closest major airport is Albany International Airport in New York, although three daily round trip flights from Rutland to Boston are available via Cape Air from Rutland – Southern Vermont Regional Airport. Greyhound, the national intercity bus system, also serves Manchester through Premier Coach&#x27;s Vermont Translines with an intercity bus connection between Burlington, Vermont and Albany, New York.

===Rail===

Manchester has several Amtrak passenger train connections within a one-hour drive. 
* Rutland station to the north, the closest, served by the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;
* Bellows Falls station to the east, served by the &quot;Vermonter&quot;
* Fort Edward station to the west, served by the &quot;Adirondack&quot; and &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;

VTrans and NYSDOT have shown interest in restoring passenger train service to Manchester on a new Amtrak route between Albany and Burlington via Rutland, also linking up nearby Mechanicville, New York and North Bennington, Vermont. The new train would share much of its route with the &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot;, likely running beyond Albany to New York City. As of 2021, the idea is listed simply as a &quot;potential initiative&quot; in the Vermont Rail Plan.

==Notable attractions==
Hildene, the summer home of Robert Todd Lincoln and Mary Lincoln, is a mansion in the Georgian Revival style completed in 1905 that is located southwest of Manchester Center. Robert Lincoln, the only child of President Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln to survive into adulthood, served as Secretary of War to Presidents Garfield and Arthur, was appointed Minister (Ambassador) to Great Britain during the administration of President Benjamin Harrison, and later became general counsel and then president of the Pullman Company. The Hildene house and surrounding grounds are open to the public.

Also located in Manchester, at the base of Mount Equinox, is the Southern Vermont Arts Center (SVAC). In addition to hosting art exhibitions from its permanent collections and of visiting collections in its gallery facilities, SVAC conducts educational programs and provides facilities for performances and events in the arts. The permanent collection at SVAC includes the work of such regional artists as Ogden Pleissner, Jay Hall Conaway, Reginald Marsh, Guy Pene du Bois, Lorenzo Hatch, Luigi Lucioni, Arthur Gibbs Burton, and Robert Strong Woodward.

==Media==
Like the rest of Bennington County, Manchester lies in the Albany–Schenectady–Troy television and radio media market.
Manchester is home to alternative rock radio station WEQX&#x27;s studios. Their broadcast tower is on the summit of Equinox Mountain, from which their callsign derives, enabling their signal to reach the northern and eastern Capital Region of New York&#x27;s radio market area, while also being able to reach the remainder of southern Vermont, western Massachusetts, and southwestern New Hampshire.
WVNK 91.1 FM, a VPR partner station, is also licensed to Manchester. 

Print news is carried in the &quot;Manchester Journal&quot; and &quot;Bennington Banner&quot;.

<doc id="260216" wikidata="Q1016601" url="?curid=260216" title="Jericho, Vermont">
<text>Jericho is a town in Chittenden County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 5,104. The town was named after the ancient city of Jericho.

== History ==
Ira Allen and Remember Baker began surveying the town of Jericho in 1773 for the Onion River Land Company. The Browns were the first European family to settle in Jericho, in 1774, building a cabin near the Browns River.

In 1776, a detachment of the Continental Army was sent to garrison a blockhouse in Jericho along the Onion (Winooski) River. The garrison soon retreated back to Fort Ticonderoga within weeks of their arrival due to fears of British advance south from Canada. The officers involved, including Matthew Lyon, were tried and convicted by court-martial for cowardice and disobeying orders to maintain the post. The location of the Jericho blockhouse is believed to have been along River Road near the intersection with Skunk Hollow.

In 1780 the Brown family was taken captive by a war party of British-allied Mohawks returning to Canada following the Royalton Raid.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.45%, is water.

The town of Jericho has a connection with the neighboring town of Underhill. The area has four distinct village areas. The historic Old Red Mill, home of the Jericho Historical Society, stands in Jericho village (also known as Jericho Corners) on Route 15 in the northwest part of the town, an area that extends from the Browns River crossing eastward to the post office and the Jericho Elementary School. Jericho Corners is the location of the Galusha House, home of Truman Galusha, a brick Federal-style house built in 1790 and like Jericho&#x27;s Old Red Mill, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Jericho&#x27;s second village, Jericho Center, on Browns Trace, is home to several historic buildings, churches, and Jericho Center Country Store, Vermont&#x27;s oldest continuously running general store. The Jericho Center Village has a village green, or &quot;Common&quot;, a typical park-like center of a Vermont village, surrounded by historic buildings.

Half of the Underhill Flats area on Route 15 is within Jericho. This area features the multi-use Mills Riverside Park and two general stores (Jolley &amp; Jacob&#x27;s).

Underhill Center in the town of Underhill has one general store, as well as St. Thomas Catholic Church, a small postal office, and access to Underhill State Park.

Jericho is home to the Chittenden East Wolverines of the Northern Vermont Youth Football League, Cub Scout Pack 620, and one of Vermont&#x27;s oldest and largest Boy Scout troops, Troop 627.

The two towns share the Underhill-Jericho Fire Department.

<text>Saint Albans, commonly abbreviated as St. Albans, is a town in Franklin County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 6,988. The town completely surrounds St. Albans City, which is a separate municipality.

==History==
The town was named for St Albans in England. That city was named for the Early Christian English saint and protomartyr.

On October 19, 1864, St. Albans was the site of the St. Albans Raid, the northernmost Confederate land action of the American Civil War. The Confederates conducted a cavalry raid and bank robbery from across the border with Quebec, Canada.

The town of St. Albans and the city of St. Albans were not separated until 1902. References to &quot;St. Albans&quot; prior to this date generally refer to the town center, which now belongs to the city. The town was incorporated in 1859, and the city in 1902.

At times after the civil war, Irish men seeking independence for Ireland, made what are known as the Fenian raids on Canada. At least two took place in 1866, and others in 1870–1871. Men were recruited from New York City to St. Albans, Vermont. Henri Le Caron was serving as a secret agent of the British government during this time, but also held the position of &quot;Inspector-General of the Irish Republican Army&quot;. He asserted that he distributed fifteen thousand stands of arms and almost three million rounds of ammunition to the men preparing for the raids, which took place in April 1870. Forewarned, United States General George Meade, captured much of these munitions as they arrived. Many of the raiders never made it across the Canadian border. They seemed most successful in causing support to increase for the Canadian Confederation, as Canadians believed they needed to be unified in defense.

By the 1890s, the town of St. Albans had become the butter capital of the world; it had 1,000 farms and 15,000 cows.

Pilot Amelia Earhart was said to have flown here May 22, 1934. This may have been related to promotion for her line of clothing for active wear, which she began that year.

The lake monster &quot;Champ&quot; was allegedly sighted and photographed near St. Albans. The creature in Lake Champlain was ostensibly given in 1609 by French explorer Samuel de Champlain, the founder of Quebec City and the lake&#x27;s namesake, who is supposed to have been the first white man to record spotting &quot;Champ&quot; as he was fighting the Iroquois on the bank of the lake. However, in actuality no such sighting was recorded, and it has since been traced back to a 1970 article.

<text>St. Albans is the only city in and the seat of Franklin County, Vermont, United States. At the 2020 census, the city population was 6,877. St. Albans City is completely surrounded by St. Albans Town, which is a separate municipality. The city is located in Northwestern Vermont, 29 miles north of Burlington, Vermont&#x27;s most populous city, which is located in Chittenden County.

==History==

One of the New Hampshire grants, St. Albans was chartered by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth on August 17, 1763, to Stephen Pomeroy and 63 others. Named after St Albans, Hertfordshire, England, it was first settled during the Revolution by Jesse Welden. The war delayed further settlement until 1785, when other pioneers began to arrive from lower New England.

Farmers found the rich, dark loam suitable for cultivation, as well as for the raising of cattle, horses and sheep. Butter and cheese were produced in great quantities. St. Albans also became known as &quot; The Rail City,&quot; home to a major depot, operations center and repair shop of the Vermont and Canada Railroad. When the village was incorporated in 1859, it had an iron foundry, a manufacturer of freight cars, and a large number of mechanic shops.

The northernmost engagement of the Civil War, known as the St. Albans Raid, occurred here on October 19, 1864.

In 1869 the Congrégation de Notre Dame, founded in Montreal, Quebec, in the 17th century, established Villa Barlow Convent and St. Mary High School in St. Albans.

In 1902, the City of St. Albans was incorporated, comprising two square miles (518 hectares) within the town of St. Albans. Today it is a tourist destination noted for its Victorian and Craftsman style architecture. Much of this was built during the railroad era, when more than 200 trains passed through daily.

St. Albans is a research focus for genealogists, as European immigrants heading for the United States would sometimes land in Canada at Halifax, Nova Scotia or Montreal, Quebec, then take a train through the border crossing to this city. Some persons traveled to other parts of Vermont, New York or points west. The National Archives (NARA) lists for St. Albans cover the period 1895–1954.

==Culture==
In late April St. Albans hosts the annual Vermont Maple Festival. The festival includes various food-related contests, as well as the Sap Run, a footrace from Swanton, to the north. It was home to the Vermont Voltage, a semi-professional men&#x27;s soccer team, which folded in 2014.

<text>Swanton is a town in Franklin County, Vermont, United States. The population was 6,701 at the 2020 census. The town includes the village of Swanton.

==History==
The town of Swanton was chartered in 1763 as one of the New Hampshire Grants by Benning Wentworth, the governor of the Province of New Hampshire. It was named for Captain William Swanton, an officer in the British Army who had traveled through the area during the French and Indian War.

There were French land grants in the area beginning in 1734, and small French settlements including a Catholic mission in what is now Swanton from as early as 1740, when settlers in Quebec used a water route from Quebec City and Montreal to reach the banks of the Missisquoi River near what are now known as Swanton Falls.

None of the original grantees who received the charter from Governor Wentworth settled or resided in Swanton, opting instead to sell or trade their shares. Because of its proximity to the border with New France, and later the Province of Quebec, it was not populated by anyone from the British colonies in the 1760s and 1770s, the newly independent United States in the 1770s and 1780s, or the Vermont Republic in the early 1780s. As late as 1786, Ira Allen owned 59 of the original 64 shares.

In 2013, human artifacts dating from 7,000 years ago were found near the Missisquoi River, including a Neville-type stone object that might have been attached to a spear.

==Geography==
Swanton is located in western Franklin County, bordered on the west by Lake Champlain and Grand Isle County. The town limits extend northwest to the Canada–United States border within Missisquoi Bay, west of Highgate. St. Albans, the Franklin County seat, is to the south.

Interstate 89 and U.S. Route 7 run more or less parallel in a north-south direction through the town, with US 7 passing through the village of Swanton and I-89 providing access from Exit 21 just east of the village. Vermont Route 78 crosses US 7 in the center of Swanton village, leading east to Enosburg Falls and west across Lake Champlain to Alburg. Vermont Route 36 leads west from Swanton village to Lake Champlain, then turns south along the shore to St. Albans Bay. Vermont Route 207 runs north-south across the town east of I-89, connecting Highgate Center to the north with St. Albans to the south. Vermont Route 105 crosses the east end of the town, leading northeast to Enosburg Falls and southwest to St. Albans.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 22.11%, is water.

The village of Swanton is in the north-central part of the town, and the community of Fonda is in the south-central part. Both communities are along US 7. A large portion of the Missisquoi National Wildlife Refuge, where the Missisquoi River enters Lake Champlain, is in the northwestern part of the town.

== Local organizations ==
The Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi, also known as the Mississquoi Abenaki Tribe, a state-recognized tribe that claims descent from Missisquoi people, is based in Swanton. This organization is not federally recognized as a Native American tribe.

== Swans ==

In 1961, Queen Elizabeth II gifted a pair of her Royal Swans to the Town of Swanton at their annual Summer Festival. Swanton Chamber of Commerce members named the swans Sam (for Uncle Sam) and Betty (for Queen Elizabeth). The idea for the swans came from a summer visitor to the area, Harry Gibbons, who worked in public relations for the International Air Transport Authority of Montreal. He presented his idea to the Chamber and a letter of request was sent to Buckingham Palace. The request was granted and the swans were sent from Hickling Broad, Norfolk, England through the Smallburgh Rural District Council which includes the village of Swanton Abbott.

&quot;The swans were caught during the annual &quot;swan-upping&quot; outing held by members of England&#x27;s ancient guilds, who mark the Queen&#x27;s swans with a nick on the beak to separate them from their less exalted brethren.&quot;
The swans were presented to Vermont Governor F. Ray Keyser by a representative of the Canadian Government at a ceremony attended by dignitaries from both sides of the border.

Before summer 2016, the swans died of old age. After a gap of two years, a new set of swans (still named Sam and Betty) were secured and placed in their home in Village Green Park, surrounded by a black fence. The new swans are not related to, or descended from, the originals, but they are still called the Royal Swans.

<text>Alburgh is a village within the town of the same name in Grand Isle County, Vermont, United States. The population was 571 at the 2020 census. The town&#x27;s name came from the person primarily responsible for chartering the community, Ira Allen.

== History ==
The town in which this village is located was chartered in 1781 as &quot;Alburgh&quot;. The town&#x27;s name was changed in 1891 to &quot;Alburg&quot; by recommendation of the United States Board on Geographic Names, so it was that name adopted by Alburg Village when it was incorporated in 1917. By vote of village residents and approval by the Vermont Department of Libraries (in its capacity as the authority on Vermont place names), in 2006 its name reverted to the original spelling of Alburgh. As an incorporated village, it is administered by a publicly elected board of trustees.

<text>Alburgh (formerly Alburg) is a town in Grand Isle County, Vermont, United States, founded in 1781 by Ira Allen. The population was 2,106 at the 2020 United States Census. Alburgh is on the Alburgh Tongue, a peninsula extending from Canada into Lake Champlain, and lies on the only road-based route across Lake Champlain to New York state north of Addison, Vermont.

==Name spelling change==
The original name of the town, &quot;Alburgh&quot;, was changed to &quot;Alburg&quot; in 1891 by recommendation of the United States Board on Geographic Names. The board recommended that all municipality names ending in &quot;-burgh&quot; be revised to end in &quot;-burg&quot; for the sake of standardization. In April 2006, the Vermont Department of Libraries (in its capacity as the authority on Vermont place names) approved the town&#x27;s request to change its name from Alburg back to Alburgh after a majority vote on town meeting day.

== European settlement of Alburgh Tongue and founding of Alburgh ==
A two-league strip between Missisquoi Bay and the Chambly River (now the Richelieu River) north of the Alburgh tongue was granted by Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Charles de la Boische, Marquis de Beauharnois, and Intendant of New France Gilles Hocquart to Seigneur François Foucault on April 3, 1733 (ratified by the King of France April 6, 1734). Other seigneuries (in particular the seigneurie de la Fontaine to the south) were granted but were not settled. Janvrin Dufresne surveyed the land for the government and submitted his report on June 14, 1737, that the seigneuries were not settled. Foucault thence resubmitted his application to the land in March 1739 (requesting an extension of one league to the south), having established Missiskouy (Missiquoi) Village with six inhabitants. On May 10, 1741, the seigneuries were deemed forfeited for lack of settlement; on May 1, 1743, Foucault&#x27;s application was accepted (ratified by the King on March 25, 1745). In 1744, Foucault petitioned to extend his seigneurie over the entire peninsula to a total length of five leagues and including the former seigneurie de la Fontaine; the petition was granted November 1, 1744. By 1747, however, the peninsula had been abandoned by any European settlers.

In 1763 at the end of the French and Indian War, New France was ceded to Great Britain. General James Murray purchased the lands including Foucault&#x27;s seigneurie, and his nephew Richard Murray granted a 99-year lease of the seigneurie to Colonel Henry Caldwell in 1774.

Alburgh was charted February 23, 1781, by Ira Allen and 64 others. Allen paid for the charting, and the name of the town is probably derived from &quot;Allensburgh&quot;.

In 1781 Allen was part of the commission that negotiated the Vermont–New York boundary, placing the Alburgh Tongue in Vermont. In 1783 the Canada–United States border was established at the 45th parallel north, making the Vermonter claims to the land undisputed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 38.69%, are water.

Alburgh is one of only six non-island locations in the 48 contiguous states not directly connected to them by land, the others being nearby Province Point, Vermont; Point Roberts, Washington; Elm Point, Minnesota; the Northwest Angle in Minnesota; and an unnamed point in North Dakota. However, there are bridges to Rouses Point, New York, (U.S. Route 2) and Swanton, Vermont, as well as to North Hero island to the southeast. This makes Alburgh not practically an exclave, unlike the other locations not connected to the United States by land. Isle La Motte lies to the southwest. Alburgh Dunes State Park has one of the most natural and longest beaches on Lake Champlain.

<text>Cambridge is a town in Lamoille County, Vermont, United States. The population was 3,839 at the 2020 United States Census. Cambridge includes the villages of Jeffersonville and Cambridge.

==History==
Granted on November 7, 1780, Cambridge was chartered on August 13, 1781, to Samuel Robinson, John Fassett Jr., Jonathan Frost and 64 others. It was first settled in 1783 by John Safford from Piermont, New Hampshire. The valleys proved good but rough, best for grazing livestock. By 1839, the town had about 7,000 sheep. The Lamoille River offered water power for watermills. Industries included one woolen factory, one tannery, and one gristmill, plus several sawmills and cabinet shops.

Cambridge and neighboring Johnson were together known as the King&#x27;s College Tract, being created by Lieutenant Governor Cadwallader Colden by authority of King George III in 1764. The King&#x27;s College Tract was reserved for the eventual establishment of a university on the site. The place name &quot;Cambridge&quot; suggests the University of Cambridge in England. Johnson, the other town in the King&#x27;s College Grant, was named for William Samuel Johnson.

Both the St. Johnsbury &amp; Lake Champlain Railroad and the Burlington &amp; Lamoille Railroad passed through the town. The former is now the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail.

==Geography==
Cambridge is in western Lamoille County, bordered to the northwest by Franklin County and to the southwest by Chittenden County. The village of Jeffersonville is in the center of the town, and the village of Cambridge is in the west. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.78%, are water. Cambridge is drained by the Lamoille River, which flows from east to west across the center of the town, passing through the north sides of Jeffersonville and Cambridge villages. Two main tributaries of the Lamoille drain the southern part of the town: the Brewster River originates in Smugglers Notch at the crest of the Green Mountains in the southernmost part of the town and flows north to Jeffersonville, while the Seymour River originates in Underhill and flows north to Cambridge village.

The town is crossed by Vermont Route 15, Vermont Route 104, Vermont Route 108 and Vermont Route 109. VT-15 leads southwest to Winooski, next to Burlington, and southeast to Morrisville. VT-104 leads northwest to St. Albans, while VT-108 leads north to Enosburg Falls and south through Smugglers Notch to Stowe. VT-109 leads northeast to Belvidere. (All distances are measured from Jeffersonville.)

==Economy==
The largest employer in the town is Smugglers&#x27; Notch Resort.

==Villages and bygone villages==
* Garfield is located in the northeast corner of Hyde Park. In the late 1800s, Garfield was a village with a store, a post office (added in 1890), a school, and two sawmills. In 1922 the sawmill owned by Charles William Manning (1864–1946) burned down and he decided not to replace it, causing the loss of many jobs. Residents began to leave Garfield. Eventually their abandoned farms reverted to wilderness. The area remains thickly wooded and sparsely developed to this day. It is best known as the Morrisville turnoff point for the Green River Reservoir State Park.
* Hyde Park village is in the southern part of town, on a hill rising above the north bank of the Lamoille River
* North Hyde Park is in the northwest corner of the town, along the Gihon River. Part of the settled area extends west into the town of Johnson.

<text>Newbury is a town in Orange County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,293 at the 2020 census. Newbury includes the villages of Newbury, Center Newbury, West Newbury, South Newbury, Boltonville, Peach Four Corners, and Wells River.

==History==
Located at the Great Oxbow of the Connecticut River, with vast tracts of beautiful and fertile intervale, the area was a favorite of the Indians. Rivers teemed with salmon and brooks with trout. Prior to European settlement, the Newbury area was the location of a village called Cowass or Cowassuck of the Pennacook tribe. Cowass in Abenaki is &quot;Coo-ash-auke,&quot; meaning &quot;place of pine trees,&quot; and was a general name these people gave to the upper Connecticut River Valley and Lakes region. In 1704 the Pennacook at Cowass kept several captives from the Deerfield Raid in the village, including Stephen Williams who was kept with Sachem George Tahanto The area was first settled by English colonists in 1762 by Samuel Sleeper and family. One of the New Hampshire grants, Newbury was chartered by Governor Benning Wentworth on March 18, 1763, to Jacob Bayley and 74 others, some from Newbury, Massachusetts.

The town served as the southern terminus of the Bayley Hazen Military Road, begun by Bayley in 1760 and then continued until 1779 by Colonel Moses Hazen. Meanwhile, pioneer farmers had to carry their grain 60 miles (97 kilometers) by canoe to Charlestown, New Hampshire to get it ground into flour. By 1859, when the population was 2,984, Newbury had two gristmills, in addition to a paper mill and steam mill to manufacture mackerel kits. The principal industry, however, along the alluvial meadows was raising beef cattle and sheep, and the production of wool and dairy goods. The Connecticut &amp; Passumpsic Rivers Railroad opened on November 6, 1848, to the village of Wells River. It developed as an adjunct of the railway town across the Connecticut River at Woodsville, the once bustling village within Haverhill, New Hampshire.

In the summer of 1913 a large fire destroyed 21 buildings in Newbury, including a church, the public school, the hotel and a number of businesses and residences. Only a change of the wind saved the balance of the town since there was no fire department at that time.

In 1958, Newbury gained widespread notoriety after an unpopular farmer disappeared. The discovery of his bound body in the river three months later led to his death being described as a &quot;lynching&quot; by newspapers along the East Coast. Two suspects were acquitted, and the crime was never solved.

Boston University, one of New England&#x27;s largest universities, traces its roots to the establishment of the Newbury Biblical Institute, a Methodist school founded in Newbury, Vermont in 1839.

<text>Barton is a village located near the center of the town of Barton, in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 690 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In the 19th century, the village was the economic center of the county. Prior to incorporation, the village had been known as &quot;Barton Mills.&quot; Tourists from Boston and New York arrived by train and could register in one of three major hotels. The village was incorporated on November 21, 1874.

Fire permanently reshaped the village, starting with the 1883 destruction of the building on the site now occupied by the Pierce Building. The hotels were destroyed, mostly by fire, in 1967 and 1971. The Pierce Block was built in 1885 and is still being used for commercial purposes, one of the few business buildings to survive the multitude of fires that the village has experienced. In 1889, a waterworks was constructed using May Pond. Presumably sewage disposal was constructed concurrently. Water was needed to extinguish fires. Villagers had long been frustrated by their inability to quench fires with existing cisterns, which were replaced by fire hydrants.

In 1895, the village constructed a hydroelectric plant on the Clyde River in West Charleston.

An Indian burial ground was discovered during the excavation for the new Barton Academy in 1907. There is no record of what happened to those artifacts.

In 1907, a ballpark with 200 seats in the grandstand was constructed at the corner of Park and Elm Streets. A professional village team played there and won the professional state championship over rival Orleans in 1908.

There was heavy flooding in 1927 which severely damaged the village.

A fire on August 11, 1938, destroyed three business blocks. The fire ruined any hope of an industrial revival. The Orleans County Monitor commented that it dealt an &quot;irreparable injury to a community struggling to maintain its position as a secondary business and trade center in Vermont.&quot;

Fires consumed buildings housing a butter tub factory (2 fires prior to 1916), the Opera House (1929), a cheese factory (1954), and the Monitor building (1968).

In the late 1970s, the federal and state governments stopped the village from dumping raw sewage into the Barton River. Barton&#x27;s new treatment plant cost $3.6 million, 90% of which was paid for by state and federal governments. The village was not able to separate out its old storm sewers from the sewage system. This has caused subsequent problems during rainstorms.

The village contains three places on the National Register of Historic Places:
#Crystal Lake Falls Historic District (August 7, 1994)
#Crystal Lake State Park listed August 30, 2005
#King Block — 117 High Street (added July 20, 2002)

An article in the local paper inventoried businesses that had been closed with no expectation of reopening, these included 7 gas stations, an automobile franchise, and two restaurants. One of the problems it cited was the highest water and sewage rates in the county.

==Government==
In 2009, the village spent $474,557 on village operations alone, not including solely owned utilities.

The village maintains its own water system, obtaining water from Pensioner Pond (in Charleston), with , May Pond with , and the Barton Reservoir. The system serves 370 customers. Water rates are $10.61/; sewer rates are $16.90/.
The rates are higher than surrounding towns because of the use of ground water rather than a well.

In 2013, a user consuming of water monthly would pay about 3 cents per gallon.

In 2010, the village received two grants totaling over $3.3 million, and two loans totaling over $1 million to upgrade its sewer and storm drainage system.

The 2010 budget for the water department was $214,348. The budget for the waste water department was $318,657.

Estimated annual consumption of water for 2015 ranged from for 284 current users.

===Education===
The village and surrounding area supports a graded school. In 2005, there were 171 students. 57.9% get free or reduced lunch. The effective spending per pupil was $11,197 in 2008. The average in Vermont was $11,548.

<doc id="260240" wikidata="Q1542306" url="?curid=260240" title="38th Annual Grammy Awards">
<text>The 38th Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 28, 1996, at Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles. The awards recognized accomplishments by musicians from the previous year. Alanis Morissette was the main recipient, being awarded four trophies, including Album of the Year. Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men opened the show with their Record of the Year nominated &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;.

The ceremony was controversial for its unexpected snub of Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Daydream&quot; album, which proved to be one of the bestselling and most acclaimed albums of 1995. When the Grammy Award nominees were announced, and &quot;Daydream&quot; was nominated for six different awards, critics began raving how it would be &quot;cleaning up&quot; that year. Carey, being a multiple award nominee, was one of the headlining performers. Together with Boyz II Men, she sang a live rendition of &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, to a very positive response. The album had lost all of its six nominations, shocking most critics who branded it the &quot;album of the year&quot;. Carey did not perform again until the 2006 ceremony, when she was nominated for eight awards (winning three) for &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot;.

The ceremony is also significant for Tupac Shakur introducing Peter Criss, Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons, and Paul Stanley of Kiss for the first time in full makeup and costume since 1979. Shakur said &quot;And I&#x27;ve seen just about everything now,&quot; in response to seeing Kiss walk on stage to announce the nominees for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocal. 

Also Michael Jacksonʼs 1995 HIStory Album received 6 nominations respectively winning one for Best Music Video , Short form for Scream .

<doc id="260241" wikidata="Q1868852" url="?curid=260241" title="Barton, Vermont">
<text>Barton is a town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,872 at the 2020 census. The town includes two incorporated villages, Barton and Orleans. Approximately a quarter of the town&#x27;s population lives in each of the villages, and approximately half lives outside the villages. Only four other towns in the state contain two incorporated villages.

The  Nulhegan Abenaki Tribe, a state-recognized tribe, is headquartered here.

==History==
The Abenaki and their ancestors had been in this area for 12,000 years. They were part of the large Wabanaki confederacy of related Algonguian-speaking peoples that extended into what is now Canada. In 2011 and 2012 the state of Vermont officially recognized four Abenaki tribes. The Nulhegan Abenaki Tribe has its headquarters in Barton.

Early European traders and colonists were French. Anglo-Americans began to enter the area later in the 18th century. Both groups pushed the Abenaki aside when they wanted the land, and the natives suffered high mortality due to new infectious diseases.

France and England continued their European competition in North America, including in wars of the early 18th century. There was frequent raiding by each group of colonists and their Native American allies between their settlements, leading to a brisk trade in ransomed captives.

The French and Indian War was the North American front of the Seven Years&#x27; War later in the century. In the latter warfare, Rogers&#x27; Rangers attacked Saint-Francis, Quebec in 1759, but were forced to retreat. They came through this area, splitting their forces before reaching Barton. One group followed the Barton River south to the falls at the outlet of Crystal Lake, where they caught fish to eat. They continued south over the summit into the Passumpsic River Valley.

After the American Revolutionary War and independence, Barton was chartered on October 20, 1789. The land was granted in lieu of pay to 60 Revolutionary War veterans, mainly from Rhode Island. They included Admiral John Paul Jones, General William Barton after whom the town was named, and Ira Allen. Prior to formal chartering, the town had been known as &quot;Providence.&quot;

From 1791 to 1793 Timothy Hinman built what is now called the Hinman Settler Road, linking Barton south to Greensboro and north through Brownington to Derby and Canada. The early Anglo-American settlers of Barton found wigwams, in a decayed condition, quite numerous in the vicinity of the outlet of Barton pond. They realized that this had been a favorite camping ground of the Abenaki. They noted that Foosah, an Abenaki, said that he had killed 27 moose, besides large numbers of beaver and otter, near this pond in the winter of 1783–1784.

On June 6, 1810, the body of water known today as Runaway Pond flooded the Barton River Valley, resulting in widespread destruction. Its effects can still be seen today. In 1824, voters decided to fund education for all children, establishing public schools. A private academy started operating in 1852 with 107 students. This was the forerunner of Barton Academy.

Railroad construction reached Barton in 1858. The first train arrived in 1863. As each new railroad terminus was built, the stagecoaches used them as well. The stage ran north from Barton, from what is now the junction of State Road 58 and US 5, to connect with the Hinman Settler Road. It came from Glover and ran up Barton Hill, over what is now Maple Hill Road, and on to what is now the Orleans Country Club; from there it went to Brownington.

Fred Kimball opposed slavery and became an agent on the Underground Railroad before the Civil War, assisting refugee slaves from the South to reach freedom in Vermont or pass into Canada. Some of the refugees wanted to get as far as possible from slave catchers, who became more aggressive as bounties were increased after the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act.

Some 182 men from the town volunteered to fight in the Civil War. By 1863, enthusiasm for the war had waned, and Congress passed legislation to start a draft of soldiers. Individuals were allowed to buy their way out of the draft for $300, a steep sum for many men at the time, or find a substitute, usually paying a bounty of $100. Barton&#x27;s quota was 14. Of the 14 men originally drafted, seven bought their way out, and six obtained a substitute. One served.

The town had a total of seven granite quarries, which were a mainstay of the economy. Around 1900, a granite quarry was located on the east side of Crystal Lake. Steamboats carried stone by barges across the lake. In winter, barges were slid across on the ice.

In 1907 excavation for the new Barton Academy revealed an Abenaki burying ground. There is no record of what happened to the artifacts that were discovered in the graves.

Increasing steadily, Barton&#x27;s population reached a peak of 3,506 people in 1920. In 1921, the town put on a large pageant celebrating its 125th anniversary. A professional choreographer and playwright was hired. 300 townspeople performed, and they were watched by 4,500 paying spectators, a record audience for the county at the time. The investment of $1,000 was recouped. The festival area was afterwards known as Pageant Park, which is now owned by the Barton village.

Following the outbreak of World War II, the Portland Pipeline company built a crude oil pipeline to Montreal, Canada from Portland, Maine in 1941. It wanted to avoid the risk of U-Boat attacks that resulted from shipping by sea. In 2005, the portion of the line that passes through Barton town was evaluated and taxed at $2,277,000.

The last one-room schools stopped operation in the late 1950s. In 1964, a candlepin bowling alley was opened. Up to ten community leagues used the facility. It closed in 2000 after some legal problems.

In 1967, the school districts found that their high schools, Barton Academy and Orleans High School, were too small to accommodate current needs. They converted them to elementary school use and built a new facility, Lake Region Union High School.

On February 14, 2016, the temperature dropped to . The high for the day was . There had been insufficient snow to insulate homes against the cold, and a life-threatening emergency developed after electric power failed.

Exterior electrical generators could not be started due to the cold. Plumbing froze and burst in many houses.

===South Barton===
The unincorporated village of South Barton, sometimes called Kimball Station, no longer exists. It was located near the Wheeler Mountain Road south of Crystal Lake on present-day Route 5.

In 1858, Barton (and Orleans County) obtained a triangular piece of land from Sheffield which included all of May Pond, the entire area south of Crystal Lake, and the village of South Barton. In 1861, the village of South Barton had its own post office, and, in 1874, its own railroad depot. In the early 1930s, 30 students attended its one-room schoolhouse.

Its main industry was logging. The village foundered because it lacked electric power, which the other two villages in town had aggressively pursued getting installed. South Barton tried to rely on steam power, but by the early 1940s, the village was no longer viable. Its post office closed in 1947. Three industries operated successively in the same location: the Orleans and Caledonia Steam Mill Company, Willoughby Wood and Lumber Company, and US Bobbin and Shuttle Company. Eventually the relocation of the latter to New York state took enough jobs that remaining residents left the village.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 44.9 square miles (116.3 km2), of which 43.7 square miles (113.1 km2) is land and 1.3 square miles (3.3 km2) (2.81%) is water. Barton averages above sea level (ASL).

The principal rock is calciferous mica schist. About two miles (3 km) from the Irasburg line, and parallel with it, there is a narrow vein of hornblende schist the whole length of the town. In the eastern corner, covering an area of several square miles, the rocks are a mixture of granite, syenite, and protogine. Iron has been found in small quantities, and some traces of gold.

The highest peak in Barton is Barton Mountain – ASL. May Hill is high.

The Orleans County Fair has been held in the town nearly every August since 1867. It was first held at the site later developed as the Orleans Country Club. It moved to the Barton Fairgrounds, separately owned, in 1868. The fourteenth fair was held in 1903, suggesting skipped years. One year Lowell Thomas, a noted explorer, was the master of ceremonies. In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt campaigned for President here.

For many years, the fair featured harness racing, which was popular in New England. In 2009, a state record for the mile was broken at 1:56.2.

Edward Hoagland wrote an essay, &quot;Americana, etc.&quot;, a paean to the Fair of 1969. His praise of girlie shows aroused an uproar among some residents, and resulted in these being shut down as part of the attractions.

The fair continues in the 21st century. In 2011, a Guinness World Record was set when 301 Cadillacs were in the same parade on the opening day of the Fair; they far surpassed the 103 needed to beat the prior record.

<text>Newport is a town in Orleans County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,526 at the 2020 census. The town is referred to by the United States Postal Service and the media as Newport Center, the name of the main settlement of the town. Newport is also the name of the neighboring city of Newport.

==History==
Newport was formed on October 26, 1781, and chartered under the name of Duncansboro, to George Duncan, Nathan Fisk, and 63 others on October 30, 1802. Amos Sawyer, Enos Bartlett, James C. Adams were the first town selectman. Amos Sawyer was also the first Town Clerk. These were among the first settlers of Duncansboro. The name was altered from Duncansboro to Newport, October 30, 1816.

The first clearing, which began where Newport Center is now, was made by H. &amp; A. Adams and D. &amp; S. Meacham. Here they constructed a dam and put up a waterwheel sawmill on Mud Creek. Amos Sawyer, a carpenter by trade, built a home nearby. Two other settlements were established in the town: South Newport and Pickeral Point, later renamed to Lake Bridge (named for its location at the head of Lake Memphremagog). By the late 19th century, the Boston and Maine and Central Vermont railroads were routed through Lake Bridge and the small village experienced a population boom. In 1868, the Lake Bridge settlement was incorporated as the &quot;Village of Newport&quot;. The main town village, Newport Center, was also incorporated in 1908.

In 1917, the Village of Newport separated from the Town of Newport and merged with the Village of West Derby (in the town of Derby) to form the City of Newport. In 1931, by special acts of the General Assembly, the Village of Newport Center consolidated with the Town of Newport, with its former responsibilities automatically assumed by the town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 43.5 square miles (112.6 km2), of which 41.7 square miles (108.0 km2) is land and 1.8 square miles (4.6 km2) (4.07%) is water.

The unincorporated village of Newport Center is located roughly in the geographic center of town. The town also contains a smaller, secondary settlement, South Newport, located in the southern part of town.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,511 people, 587 households, and 436 families residing in the town. The population density was 36.2 people per square mile (14.0/km2). There were 746 housing units at an average density of 17.9/sq mi (6.9/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.35% White, 0.26% Black or African American, 0.73% Native American, 0.26% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, and 1.32% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.53% of the population.

There were 587 households, out of which 33.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.0% were married couples living together, 7.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.6% were non-families. 19.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.57 and the average family size was 2.93.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 26.5% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 27.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 102.4 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $34,758, and the median income for a family was $43,828. Males had a median income of $28,063 versus $21,389 for females. The per capita income for the town was $17,677. About 10.1% of families and 12.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.1% of those under age 18 and 4.1% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Newport is the only city in, and the shire town of, Orleans County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 4,455. The city contains the second-largest population of any municipality in the county (only neighboring Derby is larger), and has the smallest geographic area. It is the second-smallest city by population in Vermont. Newport is also the name of neighboring Newport Town.

Newport was founded by European Americans as a settlement in 1793 and was first called Pickerel Point. It was the place where Rogers&#x27; Rangers retreated in 1759 after a French and Indian War incursion into Canada. In the 19th century, the village was stimulated by construction of the railroad in 1863, during the American Civil War. The lumbering firm Prouty &amp; Miller operated here from 1865. Long after the post-war Reconstruction era, the village was the site for a Reunion Society of Vermont Officers in 1891. Newport has two public schools, one private school, and a branch of the Community College of Vermont. As of the 2010 census, there were 4,589 people.

==History==
=== Early ===
In 1753, during the French and Indian War, an Abenaki band took English captive John Stark by canoe down Lake Memphremagog and came ashore at the site where the city of Newport later developed. Allies of the French during this war, they had captured Stark in a raid. They held him until his family and community raised a ransom. They then returned him to his home in New Hampshire. Given the warfare on the border with Canada, both sides took captives for ransom beginning in the late 17th century. Business was brisk at the time of Queen Anne and other English rulers.

Newport as a settlement was founded in 1793, after the American Revolutionary War. The village was first called Pickeral Point, but later renamed as Lake Bridge for its location at the head of Lake Memphremagog.

In 1816, part of the former town of Salem was annexed to the Town of Newport; it was absorbed into what was then a village.

The railroad was constructed to Newport in 1863. In 1868, the Lake Bridge settlement was incorporated as the Village of Newport. It became a busy lumber town. The lumbering firm of Prouty &amp; Miller was started in 1865.

In 1932, during the Great Depression, the city operated a poor farm for the indigent, who worked for their board.

=== Transportation ===
The &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; steam excursion/ferry boat started operating in 1867. It stopped operations in 1917. This steamboat is used as Newport&#x27;s logo.

In 1868, a livery stable started operating behind a hotel, several blocks from the railway station, which opened in 1863. At its peak, its owner kept 100 horses there.

By the late 19th century, the Boston &amp; Maine and Central Vermont railroads were routed through Lake Bridge. The small village expanded because of increased connections to outside markets and ease of transportation; it attracted more residents. By the late 20th century, railroad passenger traffic had declined because people relied on individual vehicles; the last passenger train left Newport in 1965.

In 1917, the city paved Main Street. By the summer of 1930, traffic on the street had increased to 4,000 motor vehicles a day.

The city sold its airport to the state of Vermont in the 1970s.

=== Military ===
Rogers&#x27; Rangers, a Vermont militia, were forced to retreat through the county following their attack on Saint-Francis, Quebec in 1759, during the French and Indian War. To confound their pursuers, they split up on the east shore of Lake Memphremagog. One group followed the Clyde River east. Another followed the Barton River south.

In the early 19th century, the women of pioneer Calvin Arnold&#x27;s household refused to continue to live there. It was located near what is now Clyde Pond, and subject to raids by Indians.

During the American Civil War, the city had a scare when they received news of the St. Albans Raid. They thought these raids might repeat throughout the state, particularly at the south end of the lake. The militia was turned out. The ferry from Magog was met with determined-looking armed men, much to the captain&#x27;s surprise, who had heard nothing about the raid. Armed Norwich University students were shipped in by train. Nothing happened and everyone was sent home after a few days.

In 1891, the American Civil War Reunion Society of Vermont Officers held its annual reunion in Newport.

In August 1942, a single-engine Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) training plane crashed into the lake near the west shore and the city, killing the pilot, the only occupant.

=== Architecture ===
In 1873, the Bellevue Hotel was built to accommodate 75; later it expanded to hold 100 guests. It was renamed as the Newport House by 1891. It was demolished in 1973. The Memphremagog Hotel burned in 1907.

The Newport Wharf Light was a tower built on Lake Memphremagog in 1879. It has since been demolished.

The current county courthouse was built in 1886. That was the year that the legislature moved the shire town here. In 1879, the Field Opera House and Clock Tower was constructed. In 1896, it was destroyed by fire. The municipal building was later constructed at this site.

Lane&#x27;s Opera House was constructed in 1892. It burned in 1923.

The Goodrich Memorial Library was built in 1899. The parochial Sacred Heart School was opened in 1904 as part of the Burlington Roman Catholic Diocese School District. It closed in the fall of 2007 because of falling enrollment.

In 1917, the city of Newport was formed from portions of the towns of Newport (former village of Newport) and Derby (former village of West Derby). It was organized on March 5, 1918. The four elementary schools were named after the section of the city they were in: East, West, and South schools. Newport High was across from the West School. There were 60 businesses downtown; east, west and south had an additional 40 businesses.

The current federal courthouse was built in 1904. At the time, it included the United States post office, which has since relocated to a more modern facility.

The city was once divided into at least five neighborhoods: Chief-O, Stove-Pipe City, Skunk Hollow, French Village, and Batesville. Most of these names are not used in the 21st century. Batesville was the section around Prouty Bay. Skunk Hollow was in the valley west of Western Avenue.

=== Business ===

The lumbering firm Prouty &amp; Miller, started in 1865. It operated for more than 100 years, closing in the 1980s.

The Frost Veneer Mill, located on Prouty Bay, was once a primary employer in the Batesville neighborhood.

Between 1936 and 1953, the International Club in Newport had the largest dance floor in New England. . It could hold 2,000 dancers. Notable national performers entertained here while en route between the larger cities of Boston and Montreal, traveling on the Boston &amp; Maine trains. They included: Louis Armstrong, Charlie Barnet, Les Brown, Cab Calloway, Rosemary Clooney, the Dorsey Brothers, Jimmy and Tommy; Stan Kenton, Kay Kyser, Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Tony Pastor, and Louis Prima.

In 2003, the Newport-headquartered Citizens Utility was sold. Its assets and operations were divided between Great Bay Hydro and Vermont Electric Cooperative. The Vermont Teddy Bear Company once had a plant within the city. A Columbia Forest Products plant employed about 100 workers. A local subsidiary of an international ski clothing manufacturer once employed 30 workers. It closed in 2011.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (20.87%) is water. The city surrounds the southern shore of Lake Memphremagog. Three of the four major rivers in the county empty into the lake here: the Clyde, Barton, and the Black.

Newport borders the towns of Coventry to the south, Newport to the west, and Derby to the north and east.

* U.S. Route 5 – connects the city with the town of Coventry to the south, and the town of Derby to the north and east
* VT Route 105 – connects the city with the Town of Newport, and the town of Derby (concurrent with route 5)
* VT Route 191 – &quot;Access Road&quot;, connects I-91, Exit 27, to the city of Newport

U.S. Route 5 and VT Route 105 are concurrent through much of their routes through the city.

Interstate 91 is the nearest interstate highway, and runs through the neighboring town of Derby. Two exits (for VT Route 191 and for US 5/VT 105) provide access to Newport.

The city has six stoplights, which is most of the stoplights in the county. Five are on Route 5.

====Major bridges====
There are three major bridges over the South Bay of Lake Memphremagog, two of which connect two parts of the city, the former village of Newport with the former village of West Derby. Those two are the bridge on Route 5, and the &quot;Long Bridge&quot; connecting Route 5 to Mt. Vernon Street. Plans are underway to replace this latter bridge starting in 2012. It will cost about $5.26 million. The state will pay 90%; the city, the remainder.

The final bridge is the trestle for the railway.

====Local community public and private transportation====
RCT (Rural Community Transportation), a non-profit organization, runs out of Saint Johnsbury and serves Caledonia, Essex, and Orleans counties. For general use, there are four buses north and south during the week from west Newport city to Derby, and two buses each way on Saturday. There is no bus fare. 

====Railroads====

The city was once a junction for the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Alouette&quot; and &quot;Red Wing&quot; trains splitting northwest to Montreal on the Canadian Pacific Railway and other &quot;Red Wing&quot; sections joining the New Haven Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; and going directly north on Quebec Central Railway tracks to Sherbrooke, Quebec and Quebec City. Trains went south on Boston and Maine tracks towards New York City and on B&amp;M tracks also towards Boston via Concord, New Hampshire. The &quot;Connecticut Yankee&quot; was the last strictly north–south international train, and it stopped going north across the border in the mid-1950s.

<text>Brandon is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 4,129.

==History==
On October 20, 1761, the town of Neshobe was chartered to Capt. Josiah Powers. In October 1784, the name of the town was changed to Brandon by an act of the legislature.
Brandon is a study in early American architecture and Vermont history. When the first settlers came to the area in the mid-1770s, they established the village of Neshobe. The area was rich in natural resources with excellent farmland along the rivers and abundant supplies of timber and minerals. The town flourished during the 1800s with several industries relying on the key resources of waterpower, iron ore and marble. The coming of the railroad in 1849 enabled the manufacture and shipping of iron-based products such as the Howe scale, as well as Brandon paints, wood products and marble.

During its century of rapid growth, Brandon Village evolved a unique village plan. The historic Crown Point military road came through Brandon to connect Lake Champlain to the Atlantic coast. In the ensuing decades, government and individuals developed commercial streets at the core which radiated out from the greens lined with residences leading to farms, mines and quarries in the town. Pearl and Park streets were laid out to be suitable for militia training, resulting in broad, tree-shaded streets with deep front yards.

Statesman Stephen A. Douglas was born in Brandon, and his birthplace is now the Brandon Museum as well as the town&#x27;s Visitor Center. Douglas returned in 1860 to inform a crowd that Brandon was a good place to be born and leave.

Thomas Davenport, proclaimed by some to have invented the electric motor, was born and lived in Brandon.

As the early industries began to decline, dairying, stock breeding and tourism became increasingly important and ensured the economic survival of Brandon in the 20th century. The establishment of the Brandon Training School in 1915 was a significant event, providing many employment opportunities for area residents. At its height, the Training School served over 600 Vermont residents. Changes in policy and social service practices led to closing the facility in November 1993. The campus, now called Park Village, is used for a variety of purposes including residential, industrial, and institutional uses.

Brandon&#x27;s historic downtown, with its entire core of 243 buildings, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Brandon High School closed in 1961 when Otter Valley Union High School opened. The time that Brandon High School closed was during a wave of consolidation that swept rural areas during the second half of the 20th century. There have since been efforts to convert the old school building into apartments or condominiums.

<text>Fair Haven is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States. The population was 2,736 at the 2020 census. Within the town is located the census-designated place of Fair Haven. The town is noted for its late 19th century residential and commercial architecture.

==History==
Fair Haven was chartered on October 27, 1779, to Ebenezer Allen and 76 associates, and first settled the same year. The township originally included West Haven, which was set off on October 20, 1792. The post office at Fair Haven was established in 1797. In 1783, Colonel Matthew Lyon moved to Fair Haven and began building mills at the falls on the Castleton River. His enterprises included a gristmill, sawmill and papermill, in addition to a forge, as well as a newspaper, the &quot;Fair Haven Gazette&quot;. This began Fair Haven&#x27;s legacy as a small, prosperous mill town, which by 1859 included a marble mill, rolling mill, nail factory, papermill producing wallpaper, three sawmills, a wagon shop, a machine shop, two blacksmith shops, and two shoe shops.
The quarrying and manufacture of slate began in 1846. Fair Haven would develop extensive quarries for the stone, believed at the time to be inexhaustible, which was supplied to cities along the Atlantic coast and in the West. Some of it was made into the framed, book-sized writing slates that students of the time used. On April 7, 1880, a very small area of Fair Haven was transferred to New York due to a change in the course in the Poultney River. The area transferred was west of the &quot;middle of the deepest channel&quot; of the river.

<text>Poultney is a town in Rutland County in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Vermont. New York state is on its western border. Castleton, Vermont, is on its northern border. Poultney was home to Green Mountain College, a private liberal arts college that closed in 2019. The Village of Poultney is entirely within the town. The town population was 3,020 at the 2020 census.

==History==
One of the New Hampshire Grants, Poultney was charted on September 21, 1761, by Benning Wentworth, Royal Governor of New Hampshire, and named for William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath, a British politician and orator.

Poultney was first settled by Thomas Ashley and Ebenezer Allen. Ashley married Zeruiah Richards, and Allen married Lydia Richards, both daughters of Zebulon Richards of Windham County, Connecticut. Ashley and Allen established themselves in a cabin near the Poultney River on February 15, 1771. Allen brought his family with him, and a son born to his wife Lydia in 1772 was the first white child born in Poultney. Ashley built a shanty and planted corn before bringing his family to Poultney—he returned with his family in the fall of 1771. Six of Ashley’s brothers followed him to Poultney during the next two years, and several members of the Richards family were also early settlers.

The town grew slowly at first because of the unresolved conflict between New York and New Hampshire over land ownership in Vermont. The Great List of Freemen in Poultney in 1781 contains the names of only 88 men. Most of the early settlers of the town came from Connecticut and Massachusetts.

All but one of the males in Poultney were supporters of the American Revolution, and most served in the army at various times during the American Revolutionary War. In 1777, Poultney was threatened with invasion by the British, and the men of Poultney left to answer the call to arms. The women and children of Poultney fled the town on July 8, 1777, in the face of Gen. John Burgoyne’s army which was advancing from the north. Most families returned to their former Massachusetts and Connecticut houses during this period of unrest. After Burgoyne’s defeat, the villagers returned to Poultney during spring of the following year.

Ebenezer Allen left Poultney in March 1783 for South Hero where he once again was the first settler in wilderness. Thomas Ashley remained in the house he built in Poultney until his death in 1810. He was a justice of the peace and a representative to the Vermont General Assembly six times between 1787 and 1801.
A grist mill was built in 1777, and the village grew up around this mill. There are many buildings of historic interest in East Poultney. Among these are the Eagle Tavern dating to 1780, the Federal style Baptist church built in 1805 by master builder Elisha Scott, and the 1823 Horace Greeley House.

East Poultney was the original home of Heman Allen, brother of Ebenezer Allen and cousin of Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen. Horace Greeley, founder of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, and George Jones, co-founder of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, both lived in East Poultney in the late 1820s. Greeley served an apprenticeship at the &quot;Northern Spectator&quot; newspaper owned by Amos Bliss from 1826 to 1830. The green and nearby streets look very similar to the way they were in the 1800s.

In the last half of the 19th century slate became a major export from the region. This attracted immigrants from many countries including Wales. Lack of social mobility, experience in processing slate, and a depressed economy in Wales encouraged many Welsh slate workers to come to the Poultney region. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many of the Welsh last name in the area are pronounced using the original Welsh pronunciation. The choir at Green Mountain College was said to have the only fully Welsh repertoire in the United States.

The East Poultney Historic District and the Poultney Village Historic District are both listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Among historical buildings located there are the Union Academy dating to 1791, the Melodeon Factory built in 1840, and the 1896 Victorian school house.

Poultney shares Lake St. Catherine (about ) with the town of Wells. Poultney lies in a slate belt, where slate roofing, tiles, and building blocks are mined and milled.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.94%, is water. Situated to the west of the Taconic Mountains, Poultney is drained by the Poultney River, a tributary of Lake Champlain.

The town is crossed by Vermont Route 30, Vermont Route 31, and Vermont Route 140. The village of Poultney is located entirely within the town.

<text>West Rutland is the central village and a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of West Rutland, Rutland County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 1,898, out of 2,214 in the entire town of West Rutland.

The CDP is in central Rutland County, in the southern part of the town. It sits in a valley on the east side of the Taconic Mountains, drained to the east by the Clarendon River, a tributary of Otter Creek, and to the west by the Castleton River, a tributary of the Poultney River. Both sets of rivers eventually flow to Lake Champlain.

U.S. Route 4, a four-lane expressway, passes south of the village center, with access from Exit 6. Route 4 leads east to U.S. Route 7 on the south side of Rutland and west to Fair Haven. Vermont Route 4A, former US 4, is Main Street through West Rutland; it leads east to downtown Rutland and west to Castleton. Vermont Route 133 (Clarendon Avenue) leads south from the center of West Rutland to Middletown Springs.

<text>Barre ( ) is a town in Washington County, Vermont, United States. The population was 7,923 at the 2020 census, making it the 3rd largest municipality in Washington County and the 16th largest municipality in Vermont. Popularly referred to as &quot;Barre Town&quot;, the town of Barre almost completely surrounds &quot;Barre City&quot;, which is a separate municipality. The original town now known as Barre was first chartered in 1780 as the Town of Wildersburgh. In 1793 the name Wildersburgh was unpopular with the inhabitants and the name of the town was changed to Barre. In 1895 the City of Barre was incorporated and separated from the town of Barre, and both continue to exist as separate municipalities.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 30.7 square miles (79.5 km2), of which 30.6 square miles (79.4 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.1 km2) (0.16%) is water. Barre is the self-proclaimed &quot;Granite Center of the World&quot;. Initially established with the discovery of vast granite deposits at Millstone Hill soon after the War of 1812, the granite industry and the town itself saw a boom with the arrival of the railroad. The fame of this vast deposit of granite, which some geologists say is long, wide and deep, soon spread to Europe and Canada. Large numbers of people migrated to Barre from Italy, Scotland, Spain, Scandinavia, Greece, Lebanon, Canada, and a number of other countries. The population increased from 2,060 in 1880, to 6,790 in 1890, to 10,000 in 1894. Millstone Hill and the nearby Barre Town Forest are now the site of a recreational, wooded trail network, where the mining holes and grout piles are still peppered throughout.

==Government==
Barre Town is represented by Francis &quot;Topper&quot; McFaun (R) and Robert LaClair (R) in the Washington-2 district of the Vermont House of Representatives. It is represented by Ann Cummings (D-Montpelier), Anthony Pollina (P-Middlesex) and Andrew Perchlik (D-Montpelier) in the Washington district of the Vermont Senate.

===Local government===

All governmental authority of the Town rests with the citizens of the Town, who exercise their powers in Town meeting and/or Town elections, and to whom the elected and appointed officers of the Town are ultimately responsible.

Three members shall be elected for terms of three years, and two members shall be elected for terms of two years. The Selectboard shall discharge all the duties conferred or imposed upon selectboards by law, including the duties of sewer commissioners, Board of Liquor Commissioners, Local Board of Health, and any similar ex officio duties. The Town Manager is the Chief Administrative Officer of the Town and he or she is appointed by the Selectboard.

<doc id="260258" wikidata="Q26071" url="?curid=260258" title="Barre (city), Vermont">
<text>Barre ( ) is the most populous city in Washington County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the municipal population was 8,491. Popularly referred to as &quot;Barre City&quot;, it is almost completely surrounded by &quot;Barre Town&quot;, which is a separate municipality.

Barre is often twinned with the nearby Vermont state capital of Montpelier in local media and businesses. It is the main city in the Barre-Montpelier micropolitan area, which has nearly 60,000 residents and is Vermont&#x27;s third largest metropolitan area after those of Burlington and Rutland. Barre is also Vermont&#x27;s fifth largest city.

==History==

On November 6, 1780, the land was granted to William Williams and 64 others. Originally called Wildersburgh, it included what is today both the town and city of Barre. It was first settled in 1788 by John Goldsbury and Samuel Rodgers, together with their families. But dissatisfied with the name Wildersburgh, citizens renamed the town after Isaac Barré, a champion of the American Colonies. In 1895, within the town was set off and incorporated as the separate city. &quot;In 1780 a tract of 19,900 acres of land in Vermont was chartered under the name of &quot;Wildersburgh&quot; to a number of proprietors. At a town-meeting of the inhabitants of this tract held in September, 1793, it was agreed that a house of worship should be erected, and it was voted that the man who would give the most towards building the same should have the right to name the township. Ezekiel Dodge Wheeler bid £62, and was permitted to name the township &quot;Barre&quot;—for Barre, Massachusetts, whence some of the settlers of the new township had emigrated.&quot;

===Granite industry===

Barre is the self-proclaimed &quot;Granite Center of the World&quot;. Initially established with the discovery of vast granite deposits at Millstone Hill soon after the War of 1812, the granite industry and the city itself saw a boom with the arrival of the railroad. The fame of this vast deposit of granite, which some geologists say is long, wide and deep, soon spread to Europe and Canada. Large numbers of people migrated to Barre from Italy, Scotland, Spain, Scandinavia, Greece, Lebanon, Canada, and a number of other countries. The population increased from 2,060 in 1880, to 6,790 in 1890, to 10,000 in 1894. By the turn of the century, Barre was noted as the state&#x27;s most diverse city.

Millstone Hill is now the site of a recreational, wooded trail network, where the mining holes and grout piles are still peppered throughout.

The Italian immigrants in particular brought a radical, largely anarchist labor movement to Barre. In the 1920s and 1930s, a number of granite strikes roiled the city; some disputes concerned wages, but workers increasingly mobilized to address health and hazard in the quarries and &quot;sheds.&quot; The strike of 1922, arguably fought to a draw, raised ethnic tensions; French Canadians were painted as strikebreakers. The Quarry Workers&#x27; International Union of North America was based in Barre. They were originally affiliated with the Socialist Labor Party before affiliating with the Industrial Workers of the World, and in 1916 and in 1929 the city elected a Socialist Party candidate as mayor of Barre. The old Socialist Labor Party Hall is still standing and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

&quot;Barre Gray&quot; granite is sought after worldwide for its fine grain, even texture, and superior weather resistance. Many sculpture artists prefer it for outdoor sculpture. In 1936 the granite quarry in Barre carved out a 35-ton cross from one section of stone in the quarry.

Hope Cemetery in Barre displays extensive examples of the sculptors&#x27; art.

==Government==
The mayor of Barre is Thomas Lauzon. Barre City has a &quot;Council-Manager&quot; form of government, and mayors serve two-year terms, with nonpartisan elections held in March. The city is divided into three wards, and each ward elects two members of the city council. Councilors serve staggered two-year terms, so one council seat from each ward is up for election every March.

Barre City also elects a full-time city clerk and treasurer. The current Clerk and Treasurer is Cheryl Metivier. The city of Barre employs a full-time city manager. Nicolas Storellicastro currently holds this position.

==Sports==
A Premier Basketball League (PBL) team, the Vermont Frost Heaves, played its games in Barre at the Barre Auditorium and at the Memorial Auditorium in Burlington, Vermont. The team was originally owned by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Alexander Wolff. A local group later assumed ownership and operated the Heaves until the team ceased operations in late 2010 and subjected its players to a dispersal draft.

The Vermont Mountaineers, a collegiate summer baseball team which belongs to the New England Collegiate Baseball League, plays its home games at nearby Montpelier Recreation Field.

The quarter-mile, high-banked Thunder Road International Speedbowl is the premier motorsports venue in the state and associated with notable NASCAR figures Ken Squier and Dave Moody. Vermont Governor Phil Scott often participates in the track&#x27;s &quot;Governor&#x27;s Cup 150&quot; among other events. Thunder Road is also frequented by the American Canadian Tour late-model series of New England, New York, and southeastern Canada. The track, which is located in Barre Town, was built in 1958 and has been in operation since 1960.

<text>Northfield is a town in Washington County, Vermont, United States. The town lies in a valley within the Green Mountains and has been home to Norwich University since 1866. It contains the village of Northfield, where over half of the population lives. The town&#x27;s total population was 5,918 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Northfield was chartered in 1781. The community was named after Northfield, Massachusetts.

Northfield, was settled between 1785 and the 1820s by Yankees from Connecticut, Massachusetts, and older Vermont towns. The period saw the development of four distinct villages: South Village, Center Village, Factory Village, and Northfield Falls. South Village, with numerous small businesses, became the first to have a distinct identity. Center Village followed, where the first post office, town clerk’s office, and churches were established, coming to serve as Northfield&#x27;s social and political center. Factory Village (now the village of Northfield), named for the woolen mill, developed next. Lastly, Northfield Falls thrived by the late 1820s.

Initially centered around farming and barter, Northfield&#x27;s economic activities diversified. Potash production thrived until about 1814, after which Elijah Paine&#x27;s woolen mill became a major employer. Wool prices declined in the 1840s, but Charles Paine, Elijah Paine&#x27;s son and president of the Vermont Central Railroad constructed the railroad through town and established its headquarters in Northfield. Hundreds worked for the line. In 1852, the railroad changed ownership and gradually moved to St. Albans, causing the town&#x27;s population to decline.

The arrival of the railroad in the 1840s transformed Factory Village into the local hub. Residents began to demand improved infrastructure and services, and petitioned the legislature to establish a separate Village of Northfield. This led to the incorporation of the Village of Northfield on November 14, 1855.

Slate quarrying provided a temporary economic boost in the 1860s and 1870s. Norwich University relocated to Northfield in 1866. In 1889, the first granite shed was built. More were constructed, and by the outbreak of World War I, over 525 people were employed in the granite sheds. Later, the granite industry faced challenges, leading to closures, and by 1954, only the Rock of Ages plant was left. The last plant, Cetrangolo Finishing Works, was closed in 1999.

<text>Brattleboro (), originally Brattleborough, is a town in Windham County, Vermont, United States, located about north of the Massachusetts state line at the confluence of Vermont&#x27;s West River and the Connecticut River. With a 2022 Census population of 12,106, it is the most populous municipality abutting Vermont&#x27;s eastern border with New Hampshire, which is the Connecticut River.

The town has been important to the history of Vermont, acting as a gateway for trade on both the Connecticut River and subsequent road and train infrastructure. Moreover the Whetstone Brook allowed the development of several mill industries that relied on water power. The town rose to national and international recognition because of several major industries in the town during the 19th century: several bookbinding companies, including Brattleboro Typographic Company which produced bibles, and Estey Organ, one of the largest manufacturers of pipe organs in the world. Both industries shrank in the early 20th century, relying more on its role as a economic hub for more rural communities and Vermont&#x27;s tourism industry.

There are satellite campuses of two colleges in Brattleboro: Community College of Vermont, and Vermont Technical College. Located in Brattleboro are the New England Center for Circus Arts, Vermont Jazz Center, and the Brattleboro Retreat, a mental health and addictions hospital. Notable annual events include Strolling of the Heifers and the Brattleboro Literary Festival.

==History==
===Indigenous people===
The location was called Wantastegok or &quot;Wantastiquet&quot; by the indigenous Sokoki band of Abenaki that resided in the area before settlement by Europeans.

===Frontier fort===

To defend the Massachusetts Bay Colony against Chief Gray Lock and others during Dummer&#x27;s War, the Massachusetts General Court voted on December 27, 1723, to build a blockhouse and stockade on the Connecticut River near the site of what would later become known as Brattleboro. Lieutenant-governor William Dummer signed the measure, and construction of Fort Dummer began on February 3, 1724. It was completed before summer. On October 11 of that year, the French attacked the fort and killed some soldiers. In 1725, Dummer&#x27;s War ended.

By 1728, and in subsequent peaceful periods, the fort served as a trading post for commerce among the colonial settlers and the Indians. But violence flared up from time to time throughout the first half of the 18th century. In 1744, what became known as King George&#x27;s War broke out, lasting until 1748. During this period a small body of British colonial troops were posted at the fort, but after 1750 this was considered unnecessary.

Although the area was originally part of the Equivalent Lands, the township became one of the New Hampshire grants, and was chartered (founded) as such on December 26, 1753, by Governor Benning Wentworth. It was named Brattleborough, after Brigadier-General William Brattle, Jr. of Boston, a military officer, cleric, slaveholder as well as a principal proprietor. Ironically, there is no record that Brattle ever visited the locality, and settlement activities remained tentative until after the 1763 Treaty of Paris, when France abandoned their claims to Vermont, part of the region which they had called New France.

Hostilities having ceased, Brattleboro developed quickly in peacetime, and soon was second to no other settlement in the state for business and wealth. In 1771, Stephen Greenleaf opened Vermont&#x27;s first store in the east village, and in 1784, a post office was established. A bridge was built across the Connecticut River to Hinsdale, New Hampshire, in 1804.

In 1834, the Brattleboro Retreat, then called the Vermont Asylum for the Insane, was established through a generous bequest by Anna Marsh of Hinsdale, New Hampshire. In 1844, the Brattleboro Hydropathic Establishment was opened by Robert Wesselhoeft; this was the third &quot;water cure&quot; establishment in the country, utilizing waters from a spring near the current downtown fire station. Until the water cure closed in 1871, the town was widely known as a curative health resort.

Other industries began to appear in the town under the initiation of the businessman John Holbrook, who initiated firms like the Brattleboro Typographic Company. These businesses initiated a decade of very successful printing industry in the town.

===Mill town===
Whetstone Falls, very close to where Brattleboro&#x27;s Whetstone Brook flows into the Connecticut River, was a handy source of water power for watermills, initially a sawmill and a gristmill. By 1859, when the population had reached 3,816, Brattleboro had a woolen textile mill, a paper mill, a manufacturer of papermaking machinery, a factory making melodeons, two machine shops, a flour mill, a carriage factory, and four printing establishments. Connected by the Vermont &amp; Massachusetts Railroad and the Vermont Valley Railroad, the town prospered as a regional center for trade in commodities including grain, lumber, turpentine, tallow and pork. In 1888, the spelling of the town&#x27;s name was shortened to Brattleboro.

The Estey Organ company, the largest organ manufacturer in the United States, operated in Brattleboro for about a century beginning in 1852. The company&#x27;s main factory was located southwest of downtown Brattleboro, on the south side of Whetstone Brook between Birge and Organ Streets. At its height, the complex had more than 20 buildings, many of which were interconnected by raised walkways and covered bridges. One of the buildings now houses the Estey Organ Museum. The entire surviving complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, both for its architecture, and for having been a major economic force in Brattleboro for many years.

In 1871, Thomas P. James, &quot;The Spirit Pen of Dickens&quot;, a printer by trade, moved to Brattleboro, where he took a job at The Vermont Farmer and Record. James claimed that the departed spirit of Charles Dickens had given him a communication during at a seance on Oak Street. According to James, Dickens&#x27; spirit conveyed that he had chosen James to write down the end of &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, which Dickens had not completed before he died. Dickens&#x27; spirit also supposedly told James that it was fine if James made a profit from the book. The book was printed by the same company that owned the Springfield Union, which was the paper that published the first news about James&#x27; claims, as well as excerpts from the new chapters of the novel. Newspaper editors from papers around New England who had employed James denounced the entire affair as a well-planned advertising hoax. The book became a sensation, being reviewed in the New York Times and widely promoted in spiritualist magazines of the day. James published the novel on October 31, 1873, and reported that he sold 30,000 copies of it. James left Brattleboro in 1879, abandoning his third wife, and moving to Watertown, Massachusetts, with his fourth wife Lizzie Plummer, a member of the wealthy Salisbury family with ties to Brattleboro&#x27;s printing and paper making industries.

British author Rudyard Kipling settled in Brattleboro after marrying a young Brattleboro woman, Carrie Balestier, in 1892. The couple built a home called Naulakha, just over the town line to the north in neighboring Dummerston. Kipling wrote &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; and other works there. He also wrote about local life in the early 1890s: heavy snowfalls, ox-teams drawing sledges, and people in the small towns beset with what he called a &quot;terrifying intimacy&quot; about each other&#x27;s lives. He recorded the death of men who had left, going to seek their fortunes in the cities or out west, and the consequent loneliness and depression in the lives of local women; the long length of the workday for farmers, even in winter, often for lack of help; and the abandonment of farms.

The first person to receive a U.S. Social Security benefit check, issued on January 31, 1940, was Ida May Fuller from Brattleboro.

On May 12, 1950, auctioneer Emma Bailey held her first auction in Brattleboro, selling a rocking chair for $2.50. She was the first American woman auctioneer, and later became the first woman admitted to the National Auctioneers Association.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 32.5 square miles (84.0 km2), of which 32.0 square miles (82.9 km2) is land and 0.5 square mile (1.2 km2, 1.42%) is water. Brattleboro is drained by the West River, Ames Hill Brook and Whetstone Brook. The town is in the Connecticut River Valley, and its eastern boundary (and the Vermont state line) is the western bank of the Connecticut River. Hills and mountains surround the town.

===Climate===

Brattleboro experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers. The town can experience snowfall as early as November and as late as April, and in the adjacent mountains and high country as late as May. Nor&#x27;easters often come with the potential of dumping a foot or more of snow on Brattleboro when they move through; such storms are not uncommon during the winter months. Summers are warm to hot and generally humid, with abundant sunshine and heavy showers and thunderstorms associated with passing cold fronts. Tornadoes are rare.

The record high is , set in 1955, and the record low is , set in 1958. In terms of average annual precipitation, May is typically the wettest month, and February is the driest. Brattleboro averages of snow annually.

Brattleboro lies in USDA plant hardiness zone 5a.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2010, there were 12,046 people, 5,364 households, and 2,880 families residing in the town. Almost all of the population is concentrated in two census-designated places identified in the town: Brattleboro and West Brattleboro. The results of recent censuses indicate very little change in the overall number of people living in the town. Despite this, Brattleboro remains the most populous town along Vermont&#x27;s eastern border.

The population density of the town was 375.3 people per square mile (144.9/km2). There were 5,686 housing units at an average density of 177.7 per square mile (68.6/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 92.1% White, 1.9% Black or African American, 0.3% Native American, 2.2% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.6% from other races, and 2.8% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.7% of the population.

There were 5,364 households, out of which 27.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.8% were married couples living together, 12.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.3% were non-families. 37.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.15 and the average family size was 2.84.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 22.3% under the age of 18, 6.6% from 18 to 24, 29.2% from 25 to 44, 25.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.6% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 84.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 79.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $31,997, and the median income for a family was $44,267. Males had a median income of $31,001 versus $25,329 for females. The per capita income for the town was $19,554. About 9.2% of families and 13.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.0% of those under age 18 and 9.2% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
Both a commercial and touristic gateway for the state of Vermont, Brattleboro is the first major town one encounters crossing northward by automobile from Massachusetts on Interstate 91, and is accessed via Vermont exits 1, 2, and 3 from that thoroughfare. It offers a mix of a rural atmosphere and urban amenities including a number of lodging establishments. Brattleboro also hosts art galleries, stores, and performance spaces, mostly located in the downtown area.

The majority of jobs based in Brattleboro are in the Health Care and Social Assistance sector, followed by Manufacturing, Government, and Retail Trade.

In 2007, after meeting qualifying criteria, the local Selectboard passed a resolution designating Brattleboro a Fair Trade Town, becoming the second Fair Trade certified town in the nation after Media, Pennsylvania.

C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, the northeast&#x27;s largest regional food distributor, made its headquarters here until 2005, when they moved their administrative offices to Keene, New Hampshire; however, because of close proximity to Interstate 91, C&amp;S still operates a large shipping and warehouse facility in Brattleboro near I-91&#x27;s Exit 3.

Ehrmann Commonwealth Dairy is headquartered in Brattleboro and operates a dairy processing facility in the town that opened in 2011.

New Chapter, an organic vitamin and supplement maker is headquartered in Brattleboro.

===Development===

The town&#x27;s densely populated center is located near Vermont&#x27;s lowest elevation point in the Connecticut river valley. Because of the surrounding steep hills there is very little flat land, and many of its buildings and houses are situated on steep hillsides, necessarily closely bunched together. This concentrated topography and population density have helped to create a semi-urban, cosmopolitan atmosphere in the downtown.

Since the 1950s, additional construction and development have expanded outside the concentrated downtown area; in the west, south, and north of the township. The southeast quarter of the town, near to and abutting the riverbank, is where its population has historically been the densest, and is composed largely of one- or two-family houses, with apartment buildings such as &quot;triple deckers&quot; interspersed among them. Commercial and industrial operations are concentrated along the north-south Canal Street (Route 5) artery. The town&#x27;s high school and the Regional Career Center are also located in this section, as is Fort Dummer State Park, which is named after the first European settlers&#x27; 1724 stockade. The original Fort&#x27;s site, however, was flooded in the early 20th century by a flood-control and hydro-electric dam built just downstream in Vernon, Vermont. An historical marker is located near the Fort&#x27;s now-underwater site, on the west bank of the Connecticut River on Vernon Road (VT Route 142), at the corner of Cotton Mill Hill.

The western section of town, built up around Vermont&#x27;s east-west Route 9, was formally designated a village in 2005. It is mostly lower-density residential in character, and features the state&#x27;s largest mobile home park and several planned housing developments and subdivisions. Away from the Route 9 conduit, other parts of western Brattleboro and some areas north of the West River have a decidedly rural character, with dirt roads, sparse housing, wooded Green Mountains foothills, and the last few farms left in the town following the 1970s&#x27; decline of the dairy industry. At its peak, the immediate Brattleboro area had over 170 farms; there are now less than a dozen remaining.

The section of Brattleboro north of the West River, formerly farmland, was mostly subdivided and developed during the 1960s and 1970s following the construction of Interstate 91, which runs north-south through the town. The area has little residential development and is dominated by larger commercial and industrial establishments and suburban-style shopping areas along Putney Road, including seven chain hotels and motels located within a short distance of each other.

Brattleboro is also the headquarters of the Holstein/Friesian Cattle Association, which houses and maintains the worldwide registries for those two breeds.

==Arts and culture==


Brooks Memorial Library houses a town historical archive, fine art paintings, and sculptures.

Brattleboro has a thriving arts community. It was listed in John Villani&#x27;s book &quot;The 100 Best Small Art Towns in America&quot;, in which it was ranked #9 among &#x27;arts towns&#x27; with a population of 30,000 or less.

On the first Friday of every month, an event known as &quot;Gallery Walk&quot; is held, during which galleries, artists, arts organizations, and stores display new art works or hold performances. Included in the organizations that participate are the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center, the Hooker-Dunham Theater and Gallery, the In-Sight Photography Project, River Gallery School, Through the Music, and the Windham Art Gallery. Gallery Walk is a mid-1990s creation of, and continues to be sponsored by, the Arts Council of Windham County.

Other arts organizations in Brattleboro include the Brattleboro Music Center, the Vermont Theatre Company, the New England Youth Theater, the Brattleboro Women&#x27;s Chorus, the New England Center for Circus Arts (NECCA), the Vermont Performance Lab, and the Vermont Jazz Center.

==Parks and recreation==
The town operates and maintains the Gibson-Aiken Center, a large recreation and community activities facility, located downtown on Main Street, along with a number of parks and outdoor recreation centers, including Living Memorial Park, whose features include an outdoor swimming pool and a municipal skiing facility. There are bicycle lanes on Putney Road in the northern portion of town, on Guilford Street near Living Memorial Park, and on a short segment of Western Avenue in West Brattleboro. Open during the summer months, Fort Dummer State Park is named for, and located near, the original site of a Dummer&#x27;s War-era stockade. The state park consists of 218 acres of protected forest, featuring hiking trails and a State campground, just south of the population center on wooded hills overlooking the Connecticut River.

Brattleboro sees a substantial seasonal influx of recreational skiers and snowboarders, many of them bound for the resorts at nearby Mount Snow and Stratton, but it is also a winter sports destination in and of itself. The town played an important role in the development and popularization of the skiing industry as a winter sport, with pioneering Brattleboro native and Dartmouth College alumnus Fred Harris, founder of the Dartmouth Outing Club (1909–1910), also establishing the Brattleboro Outing Club (in 1922), contributing to the first North American use of motor-driven ski lifts, and building the Harris Hill olympic-scale ski jumping facility, the site of international competitions every February that still attract daring ski-jumping athletes from all over the world.

==Government==
Brattleboro employs a representative town meeting local government, wherein its citizens are represented at-large by a Selectboard of five members, and by several dozen town representatives elected from three municipal districts. The Selectboard, meeting on average every week or two, is considered part of the &#x27;executive branch&#x27; of town government; its five members being elected to fill three one-year positions and two three-year positions. In turn, the Selectboard hires and supervises a full-time town manager. The town&#x27;s three districts also each elect a representative to the Vermont House of Representatives.

===State and federal representation===
Brattleboro is represented at the national level by U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch, and by Congresswoman Becca Balint, who also represents Vermont&#x27;s entire at-large federal congressional district.

At the state level in Montpelier:

*Sen. Wendy Harrison (D)
*Sen. Nader Hashim (D)
*Rep. Mollie Burke (P/D)
*Rep. Emilie Kornheiser (D)
*Rep. Tristan Toleno (D)

===Ballot initiatives===
*Brattleboro voted in support of a measure calling on the town&#x27;s police force to arrest and indict President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in March 2008. The vote was 2012–1795.
*In March 2017, Brattleboro voted in support of a ban on grocery store plastic bags by a 3 to 1 margin.

==Education==

Brattleboro has a diverse mix of public and private primary, secondary and post-secondary schools and career centers. Sub-campuses of the Community College of Vermont and Vermont Technical College are located in Brattleboro; in the downtown&#x27;s newly renovated Brooks House. Brattleboro was also home to the New England Academic Center of Union Institute and University, housed in the Marlboro College Graduate Center building.

SIT Graduate Institute, formerly known as the School for International Training, is a private higher education institution in northern Brattleboro. An outgrowth of The Experiment in International Living, which was founded in 1932 in nearby Putney, Vermont, the Graduate Institute offers master&#x27;s degrees in several internationally oriented concentrations. Its students and faculty hail from all regions of the globe, giving Brattleboro a decidedly eclectic and international flair, and its notable alumni include native Vermonter and 1997 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jody Williams.

Brattleboro currently has three public K–6 elementary schools. They are:
*Green Street School
*Oak Grove School
*Academy School

There is one public middle school, the Brattleboro Area Middle School (BAMS), and one public high school, the Brattleboro Union High School (BUHS). The Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, which oversees the public school system in the southeastern corner of Windham County, also administers a dedicated vocational education unit, the Windham Regional Career Center. Oak Meadow, a K–12 homeschool curriculum provider and distance learning school is also based out of downtown Brattleboro.

==Media==

===Print===
The town is home to the &quot;Brattleboro Reformer&quot; (est. 1876 as the &#x27;Windham County Democrat&#x27;), a daily newspaper with a weekday circulation of just over 10,000, and &quot;The Commons&quot;, a non-profit community weekly newspaper. The &quot;Parent Express&quot;, a community newspaper, circulates in Brattleboro; Keene, New Hampshire; and throughout Windham County, Vermont, and Cheshire County, New Hampshire. Local news is also carried in the &quot;Keene Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Rutland Herald&quot;.

* WTSA-FM 96.7 (hot adult contemporary)
* WVEW-LP 107.7 (community-supported low power station)

====AM====

* WTSA 1450

===Television===
Brattleboro is not reached by terrestrial broadcast television due to the surrounding mountains, in addition to being just far enough away from major cities like Boston, Springfield, and Albany. However, as of October 2022, like the rest of Vermont except Bennington County, it is considered part of the television market. Comcast and Consolidated Communications are the major suppliers of cable television programming for Brattleboro. Local stations offered on Comcast include most major Burlington-area stations, as well as WMUR-TV (ABC) and WEKW-TV (NHPTV) from New Hampshire; and WGBY-TV from Springfield, Massachusetts.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Roads and highways====

Brattleboro is crossed by six highways, including one Interstate highway. They are:

* Interstate 91
* U.S. Route 5 (&quot;Connecticut River Byway&quot;)
* Vermont Route 9 (&quot;Molly Stark Trail&quot;)
* Vermont Route 30
* Vermont Route 119
* Vermont Route 142

Vermont Route 9 runs from the New York border with Vermont, west of Bennington, traverses the southern backbone of the Green Mountains well west of Brattleboro, and eventually arrives in the heart of Brattleboro&#x27;s downtown as High Street. Its other local names are The Molly Stark Trail, &quot;Marlboro Road&quot;, &quot;Western Avenue&quot;, &quot;Main Street&quot;, and &quot;Putney Road&quot;. It meets I-91 at a partial cloverleaf interchange (from where it is Exit 2 from the Interstate), then as it advances eastward into downtown, it overlaps U.S. Route 5 at the intersection of Main and High Streets. The road then runs north with &quot;Main Street&quot; into &quot;Putney Road&quot; then to the traffic circle at Interstate 91&#x27;s Exit 3 (connected to that highway via a trumpet interchange westward from this roundabout), where it diverges from Route 5 and runs eastward into New Hampshire, becoming New Hampshire Route 9.

U.S. Route 5 enters Brattleboro at its border with the town of Guilford and runs north-south, through downtown, eventually exiting Brattleboro at its northern border with the town of Dummerston. Route 5&#x27;s local names are &quot;Canal Street&quot;, &quot;Main Street&quot;, and &quot;Putney Road&quot;. Southbound, Route 5 detours along Park Place and part of Linden Street, as part of a one-way &#x27;traffic triangle&#x27; at the north end of Main Street. Route 5, designated throughout Vermont as the Connecticut River Byway, is the only scenic byway in Vermont to receive national byway status.

Scenic Vermont Route 30 has its southern terminus in Brattleboro at the intersection of Park Place and Linden Street. From this point, it runs for about 12 miles on a very gently graded roadbed along the West River&#x27;s southern bank, affording a stunning vista and connecting Brattleboro with picturesque New England towns and recreational areas elsewhere in Windham County and Vermont. Its wide riverside paved shoulder makes it a favorite cycling route. Route 30 exits Brattleboro at its border with Dummerston and continues northwest along the West River. Its local names within Brattleboro are &quot;Linden Street&quot; and &quot;West River Road&quot;.

Interstate 91, originating in Connecticut and terminating at the Canada–U.S. border, runs north-south through town, arcing westward around the town center. Its first three Vermont exits are in Brattleboro: Exit 1 serves the southern part of town, Exit 2 serves the western section of town connecting to local ski areas via Route 9, and Exit 3 serves the northern section of town and neighboring southwest New Hampshire. I-91&#x27;s majestic twin-structure West River Bridge is, as of 2015, being rebuilt with a completely new design.

Vermont Route 119 begins at a 5-way intersection, four road directions and one parking lot entrance, with U.S. Route 5 and VT Route 142. Route 119&#x27;s local name within Brattleboro is &quot;Bridge Street&quot;. It continues east with an at-grade crossing of the New England Central Railroad just before crossing into New Hampshire over the Connecticut River, whose border lies just from the road&#x27;s western end.

Vermont Route 142 begins at the same junction with Route 5 and Route 119 mentioned above, continuing southward, closely paralleling the New England Central Railroad for much of its length within town. Its local names are &quot;Vernon Street&quot; and &quot;Vernon Road&quot;, as it continues southward into the town of Vernon and eventually into Massachusetts.

====Rail====
Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, operates its &quot;Vermonter&quot; service daily through Brattleboro, connecting the town by rail with Washington, D.C., and St. Albans, Vermont, and many stations in between. Brattleboro was recently part of a $70 million re-alignment of the &quot;Vermonter&quot;&#x27;s route to the old &quot;Montrealer&quot; route, restoring passenger rail service between Brattleboro and the western Massachusetts cities of Northampton and Greenfield. Recent upgrades to railroad tracks in Massachusetts and Connecticut, to the south, have significantly reduced rail travel time to New York and points south.

====Bus====
Southeast Vermont Transit, doing business as the MOOver and consisting of the former Current and Brattleboro BeeLine bus operations, operates 3 local bus routes around Brattleboro that also serve Guilford and Hinsdale, New Hampshire on weekdays and Saturday non-holidays. They also operated commuter bus routes between Brattleboro, Bellows Falls (weekdays) and Wilmington (everyday).

Greyhound also stops in Brattleboro.

====Air====
The closest small-craft airports to Brattleboro are the Deerfield Valley Regional Airport in West Dover to the west, and Dillant-Hopkins Airport in Keene, New Hampshire, to the east. The closest airports (both within north of the town) offering regularly-scheduled domestic commercial flights include Lebanon Municipal Airport in West Lebanon, New Hampshire, and the Rutland – Southern Vermont Regional Airport, close to Rutland. Both airports feature daily Cape Air flights to and from Boston and White Plains, New York. The closest airports with regularly-scheduled domestic and international flights are Bradley International Airport to the south, Manchester-Boston Regional Airport to the east, and Albany International Airport to the west, all of them less than two hours&#x27; driving distance from the town.

===Fire department===
The town of Brattleboro is protected by the Brattleboro Fire Department, founded in 1831 and located on Elliot Street in the downtown business district. There is also a sub-station in West Brattleboro.

===Police===
Brattleboro and West Brattleboro are serviced by the Brattleboro Police Department.

The Windham County Sheriff&#x27;s Department provides prisoner transport and serves civil documents across Brattleboro and the rest of Windham County.

The Vermont State Police have a substation in Westminster and also serve the town.

===Health care===
*Brattleboro is home to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, a 61-bed community hospital serving southeastern Vermont since 1904. As of 2014, the hospital has 137 primary care and specialist physicians on its staff.
*Golden Cross Ambulance provides EMT and ambulance service for Brattleboro, as well as Cheshire County, New Hampshire.
*Brattleboro is also home to the Brattleboro Retreat, a large private, non-profit psychiatric hospital founded in 1834. The Retreat, as it is known locally, was one of the first acute mental health care facilities founded in the United States. It is the third largest employer in the town, and 45th largest in Vermont, with a workforce of about 400 as of 2013.
*Health Care and Rehabilitation Services of Vermont (HCRS) provides Brattleboro, and the rest of Windham and Windsor counties in Vermont, with outpatient services for mental health, substance abuse and developmental disabilities. The agency is headquartered in Springfield and also has other satellite offices elsewhere in Vermont in Bellows Falls, Windsor and White River Junction.

===Utilities===
Brattleboro&#x27;s electricity is supplied by Green Mountain Power. Brattleboro&#x27;s surface water supply is the Pleasant Valley Reservoir, which the Pleasant Valley Water Plant siphons through Brattleboro at a daily average of 1.0 to 1.5 million gallons per day. Also, backup water pumps are adjacent to West River Road just north of the Brattleboro Retreat.

Cable television in Brattleboro is provided by Comcast. Comcast and Consolidated Communications also provide the town with landline phone and high speed Internet service.

<text>Newfane is the shire town (county seat) of Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 1,645 at the 2020 census. The town includes the villages of Newfane, Williamsville, and South Newfane.

==History==
One of the New Hampshire grants, the town was chartered on June 19, 1753, by Governor Benning Wentworth, who named it Fane after John Fane, the 7th Earl of Westmoreland. But hostilities during the French and Indian War prevented its settlement. Because a first town meeting was not held within the required five years, the charter was deemed null and void. So Wentworth issued an entirely new charter on November 3, 1761, as New Fane. The town was settled in 1766 by families from Worcester County, Massachusetts. Newfane became the shire town of the county before 1812. A village was built atop Newfane Hill, including the county buildings. But because of winter travel difficulties, it was relocated to the flatland below in 1825, until 1882 called Fayetteville after the Marquis de Lafayette.

The town has a diversified terrain, with both high hills and deep valleys. Farmers found good soil for cultivation on the intervales, and for grazing livestock on the uplands. Various streams provided water power for mills, and by 1859 industries included manufacturers of both leather and linseed oil, two flour mills, two lumber mills, and a large carriage factory. As a result, Newfane became prosperous during the 19th century, when it built the Federal, Greek Revival and Victorian architecture that today makes it a tourist destination.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 40.4 square miles (104.6 km2), of which 40.2 square miles (104.2 km2) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.4 km2) (0.35%) is water. The West and Rock rivers flow through the town.

Newfane is crossed by Vermont Route 30.

The West River in Newfane yielded the largest gold nugget ever found in New England, at 6.5oz. 

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 1,680 people, 693 households, and 464 families residing in the town. The population density was 41.7 people per square mile (16.1/km2).

The racial makeup of the town was 98.10% White, 0.18% Black or African American, 0.30% Native American, 0.12% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 0.06% from other races, and 1.13% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.95% of the population.

There were 693 households, out of which 31.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.1% were married couples living together, 6.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.0% were non-families. 24.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

<text>Westminster is a village in Windham County, Vermont, United States. The population was 287 at the 2020 census. Most of the village is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as the Westminster Village Historic District.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. The village is centered on the junction of U.S. Route 5 with School and Grout Streets, and extends mainly along US 5. Its western end is roughly Metcalf Drive and Cox Street, and its eastern end is the old cemetery. On School Street, the district extends north at least as far as Thompson Road.

==History==
Westminster, located in the southeastern part of Vermont, was the first town to be chartered, in 1736 by the Province of Massachusetts Bay. The layout of the village center took place in 1736–1737, and initially called for an unusually broad Main Street (now US 5). The basic plan for the village today still shows elements of this plan, with a still-broad main road layout (reduced in width in 1781 after the original plan was deemed too wide), and in the placement of municipal and civic buildings. The town hall, for example, is built on the foundation of the 18th century colonial meeting house, retaining its exterior dimensions.

Because Westminster was in an area disputed by several colonial governments, it had a second charter issued by the Province of New Hampshire in 1740, only to have that charter invalidated by a crown decision awarding the Vermont area to the Province of New York in 1764. This territorial dispute culminated in the formation of Vermont as a separate state, but not without bloodshed. Two men were fatally wounded in the Westminster massacre on March 13, 1775, in a dispute between supporters of the New York claim (led by the local New York-appointed sheriff), and a group of anti-New Yorkers occupying the courthouse. This event was significant in leading to the eventual declaration of the Vermont Republic in 1777, and its admission to the Union as a separate state in 1793. Westminster was one of the seats of the republic&#x27;s legislature, and served as a county seat until 1787.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 276 people, 118 households, and 78 families residing in the village. The population density was 209.1 people per square mile (80.7/km2). There were 124 housing units at an average density of 93.9/sq mi (36.3/km2). The racial makeup of the village was 100.00% White.

There were 118 households, out of which 28.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.6% were married couples living together, 7.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 33.1% were non-families. 25.4% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.34 and the average family size was 2.85.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 20.3% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 21.0% from 25 to 44, 33.3% from 45 to 64, and 15.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 84.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.4 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $47,969, and the median income for a family was $54,643. Males had a median income of $30,833 versus $26,375 for females. The per capita income for the village was $22,261. None of the families and 2.7% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and 5.1% of those over 64.

When the British government recognized the Province of New York&#x27;s claims to what is now Vermont, New York moved its Court of Common Pleas for Cumberland County to Westminster in 1772. It was the site of the Westminster massacre in March 1775, in which two men were killed attempting to prevent New York provincial officials from exerting their authority over the area in the long-running dispute over the New Hampshire Grants. On January 15, 1777, a group of Vermonters met in the Westminster courthouse to declare the independence of the Republic of New Connecticut (later renamed the Republic of Vermont).

<text>Ludlow is an incorporated village within the town of Ludlow, Windsor County, Vermont, United States. It is sometimes called Ludlow Village, to distinguish it from the surrounding town of the same name. The population was 773 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Ludlow Woolen Mills is a prominent feature of the village and its history. The mill was first built for woolen manufacture in 1834 and operated until 1837, when the business failed in the economic panic of that year. After sitting vacant for a time, it was sold and had resumed operation by 1853. The mill complex, by then including a machine shop, sawmill, and boardinghouse, changed hands again in 1856 and 1864. The original building, which was five stories tall, burned in 1865 and was rebuilt as the three-story brick building that remains today. By 1885 it was known as the &quot;Ludlow Woolen Company&quot; and included sections for spinning, carding, weaving, dressing, finishing and dyeing wool. In 1899, it employed 130 people and produced 150,000 yards of wool cloth annually. Early in the 20th century the mill took the name &quot;Verd Mont Mills Company&quot;, but later it was called the &quot;Gaymont Woolen Mill&quot;. General Electric acquired it in 1952 and retained ownership until 1976.

Black River Academy was chartered in Ludlow in 1835 and operated as a school, serving as the Town of Ludlow&#x27;s public high school until 1938, when a new school was built. The original academy building burned early in the school&#x27;s history, and the school operated in a church for 44 years until a new school building was built in 1888. Notable alumni of the Black River Academy include U.S. President Calvin Coolidge; Rotary founder Paul P. Harris; John Garibaldi Sargent, who was U.S. Attorney General during Coolidge&#x27;s presidency; and Vermont governor William W. Stickney. After the school closed, the Richardsonian school building was used for a time and run by Harriet Fife Bostock as a convalescent home. Since 1972 it has housed the Black River Academy Museum and Historical Society, a museum of local history.

Part of the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 as the Ludlow Village Historic District. The district includes 26 contributing properties over an area of . The district is located along a section of Main Street (Vermont Route 103) and Depot Street and includes the former Ludlow Woolen Mills (now housing a condominium and several retail businesses), post office, meeting hall, Black River Academy, fire house, and several churches, businesses, and residences.

The area streets specifically recognized by APA are North and South Park Streets, one block of Elm Street between Pleasant and Central streets; and two blocks of Central Street between Pleasant, North Park, and South Park streets. Woodstock itself is built in early 19th century New England architecture. Near the center of Woodstock is &quot;The Green&quot;, which is used for weekly farmer markets in the summer and autumn. Woodstock is a quaint New England town with a historic and lively atmosphere perfect for exploring on foot.

<text>Woodstock is the shire town (county seat) of Windsor County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 3,005. It includes the villages of Woodstock, South Woodstock, Taftsville, and West Woodstock.

==History==

Chartered by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth on July 10, 1761, the town was a New Hampshire grant to David Page and 61 others. It was named after Woodstock in Oxfordshire, England, as a homage to both Blenheim Palace and its owner, George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough. The town was first settled in 1768 by James Sanderson and his family. In 1776, Joab Hoisington built a gristmill, followed by a sawmill, on the south branch of the Ottauquechee River. The town was incorporated in 1837.

Although the Revolution slowed settlement, Woodstock developed rapidly once the war ended in 1783. The Vermont General Assembly met here in 1807 before moving the next year to the new capital at Montpelier. Waterfalls in the Ottauquechee River provided water power to operate mills. Factories made scythes and axes, carding machines, and woolens. There was a machine shop and gunsmith shop. Manufacturers also produced furniture, wooden wares, window sashes and blinds. Carriages, horse harnesses, saddles, luggage trunks and leather goods were also manufactured. By 1859, the population was 3,041. The Woodstock Railroad opened to White River Junction on September 29, 1875, carrying freight and tourists. The Woodstock Inn opened in 1892.

The Industrial Revolution helped the town grow prosperous. The economy is now largely driven by tourism. Woodstock has the 20th highest per-capita income of Vermont towns as reported by the United States Census, and a high percentage of homes owned by non-residents. The town&#x27;s central square, called the Green, is bordered by restored late Georgian, Federal Style, and Greek Revival houses. The cost of real estate in the district adjoining the Green is among the highest in the state. The seasonal presence of wealthy second-home owners from cities such as Boston and New York has contributed to the town&#x27;s economic vitality and livelihood, while at the same time diminished its accessibility to native Vermonters.

The town maintains a free (paid for through taxation) community wi-fi internet service that covers most of the village of Woodstock, dubbed &quot;Wireless Woodstock&quot;.

==Layout and design==

In his &quot;City Life: Urban Expectations in a New World&quot;, Canadian author and architect Witold Rybczynski extensively analyzes the layout of the town and the informal and unwritten rules which determined it. According to Rybczynski:

The author goes on to explicate some of the informal rules, such as that buildings stand close to the sidewalk, in the case of businesses, or ten to fourteen feet behind for homes; that plots are generally deep and narrow, keeping street frontages roughly equivalent; commercial buildings stand side by side, with only important buildings with a public function—the library or courthouse, for instance—being free-standing objects. Rybczynsk points out that there is no zoning in Woodstock, and &quot;buildings with different functions sat—and still sit today—side by side on the same streets&quot;, with practical exceptions such as the slaughterhouse and the gasworks.

The Rockefellers have had an enormous impact on the overall character of the town as it exists today. They helped preserve the 19th century architecture and the rural feel. In the late 1960s they tore down the landmark Woodstock Inn, a Victorian treasure reconstructed in 1892 from the old Eagle Hotel, which served as a center point for the town, and built a charming neo-colonial edifice farther back from the street. Laurance and Mary French Rockefeller also had the village&#x27;s power lines buried underground. To protect their ridgeline views, the town adopted an ordinance creating a Scenic Ridgeline District in order to protect the aesthetics and the views of the town. It was updated in 2007.

Woodstock was named &quot;The Prettiest Small Town in America&quot; by the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; magazine, and in 2011, North and South Park Street and one block of Elm Street won an award for great streetscape by the American Planning Association&#x27;s &quot;Great Places in America&quot; program. APA looks at street form and composition, street character and personality and the overall street environment and sustainable practices.

<text>Ashland is a city in Ashland and Bayfield counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It is the county seat of Ashland County. The city is a port on Lake Superior, near the head of Chequamegon Bay. The population was 7,908 at the 2020 census, all of whom resided in the Ashland County portion of the city. The unpopulated Bayfield County portion is in the city&#x27;s southwest, bordered by the easternmost part of the Town of Eileen.

The junction of US Highway 2 (US 2) and Wisconsin Highway 13 (WIS 13) is located at this city. It is the home of Northland College, Northwood Technical College, and the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute.

== History ==
=== Pre-settlement ===
Eight Native American nations have lived on Chequamegon Bay. Later settlers included European explorers, missionaries and fur traders, and more recently, Yankees from the eastern United States who platted and developed the lands, railroaders, shippers, loggers, entrepreneurs, and other settlers. Four flags have flown over the area around Ashland from colonial to contemporary times: Spanish, French, English and American.

The area was part of the United States&#x27; Northwest Territory. This region was divided into four successive territories for administration before becoming part of the state of Wisconsin: Indiana Territory, Michigan Territory, Illinois Territory, and Wisconsin Territory.

About the time Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World in the late 15th century, the Ojibwe people came to the land they called &quot;Sha-ga-waun-il-ong&quot;. This term has been translated numerous ways: &quot;lowlands&quot;, the &quot;needle&quot;, &quot;the region of shallow water&quot;, and where &quot;there are large extended breakers&quot;. Each is descriptive and suitably accurate. The Ojibwe stayed on Chequamegon Point for nearly a century before leaving. They settled first on Madeline Island and then moved to the Sault Ste. Marie region.

French fur traders Pierre d&#x27;Esprit, le Sieur Radisson and Medard Chouart, le Sieur des Groseilliers were the first Europeans of record to visit Chequamegon Bay. They arrived in 1659 and built what has been called the first European dwelling place in what is now Wisconsin. A historical marker noting this is located at Maslowski Beach on US 2 on the west end of Ashland. The monument was erected in 1929 by the Old Settlers Club.

The Ojibwe heartily welcomed the Frenchmen. Five years later, Father Claude-Jean Allouez arrived. A Jesuit missionary, he brought the first word of Christianity to Wisconsin&#x27;s shores. Allouez built a chapel not far from the stockade erected by Radisson and Groseillier; he worked and lived at the Bay until 1669.

=== Settlement ===

In 1854, Ohioans Asaph Whittlesey and George Kilborn set out from La Pointe to explore the head of Chequamegon Bay. Whittlesey built a × cabin in Ashland. His wife, Lucy, and daughter, Eugenia, joined him in August and prepared to winter in their new home. Signs of settlement soon began to take place. The first community dance was held at their house. The Reverend L.H. Wheeler preached the first sermon on the first Independence Day that was observed there. This village was the location of the first post office and polling place for county offices. Sunday school was also conducted on the premises.

The Milwaukee, Lakeshore and Western Railroad platted the city in 1885, as railroad construction moved westward. Local landowner Martin Beaser named the settlement Ashland after Kentucky statesman Henry Clay’s residence. Previous names for the area included Bay City, Saint Mark (for Saint Mark&#x27;s Basilica), and Whittlesey, the latter in honor of initial postmaster Adolph Whittlesey.

In the nineteenth century, immigrants to the area included many individuals and families from Germany and northern Europe, as shown by the numerous Lutheran churches in town. Some were initially attracted to agriculture or jobs in the mining industry.

=== Tar and feather attacks during World War I ===
During the last year of World War I, from March–October 1918, six recorded incidents of vigilantism took place in the Ashland area, committed against men of German descent, who were suspected of pro-German sympathies.

In Ashland mobs of masked men abducted individuals at night from their homes, driving each to secluded areas where the men were tarred and feathered. A group identifying as the Knights of Liberty claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying in a letter to a local paper, &quot;We have no purpose to do injustice to any man, but we do feel that any treasonable and seditious acts, or utterances, demand prompt punishment. These cases must not be allowed to run indefinitely, without anything being done. We want action and we want it now.&quot;

Victims included:
* Professor E. A. Schimler, abducted, tarred and feathered on March 31, 1918. Born in Germany, Schimler taught French at local Northland College. He was unable to identify any of his assailants.
* Bartender Adolph Anton, taken from his home on April 9, and stripped, tarred and feathered for his suspected &quot;pro-Germanism&quot;. Anton claimed to recognize two of the men, Ephraim Gay and George Buchanan, who were arrested, pleaded not guilty, and released on their own recognizance. A municipal judge dismissed the cases at the preliminary hearing in July. Anton left Ashland, moving to Gary, Indiana.
* William Landraint, 62, was seized in front of a downtown hotel by a mob of fifty men who put a bag over his head, handcuffed him, and drove him to the country, where he was tarred and feathered. Of German birth, Landraint was a deputy tax assessor who had been forced out of his job because of prejudice and suspected disloyalty. Despite dozens of witnesses to the kidnapping by unmasked men, none claimed to know any of the participants. Landraint later asked for police protection after receiving a threatening letter. He soon left town for St. Paul, Minnesota.
* In early June 1918 Emil Kunze went to Ashland police headquarters to report hearing men outside his home conspiring to tar and feather him for his alleged pro-Germanism. He asked for permission to sleep in the jail. He later quit his truck driving job and left town.
* In early July 1918 farmer Martin Johnson of nearby Sweden, Wisconsin, was visited at his home by men asking assistance in locating a nearby fishing stream. Once away from the house, they drove Johnson to a secluded area, and stripped, tarred and feathered him.
* On October 25, 1918, John Oestrycher, a farmer living eight miles outside Ashland, was tarred and feathered for not buying Liberty Bonds and for being &quot;pro-German&quot;.

Governor Emanuel Philipp expressed his indignation over these incidents, as well as reports of local ethnic Germans receiving threatening letters. He directed state Attorney General Spencer Haven to launch an inquiry. His investigator found the local citizenry uncooperative, including John C. Chapple, editor of the &quot;Ashland Daily Press&quot; and campaign manager for Roy P. Wilcox, a Republican candidate for governor proclaiming his own patriotism. The inquiry found the community generally satisfied with the treatment of the first victims. Haven expressed frustration at the local court, which refused to adjourn to allow the securing of evidence, and at the district attorney, who dismissed the first two cases for lack of said evidence. Haven threatened to send a company of the state guard to maintain law and order in the area. Ultimately no one was convicted for any of the attacks. Two months after the world war ended, newspapers reported that the local Knights of Liberty had disbanded. The &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; reported that more than 800 men in Ashland County belonged to the order.

=== Ore dock ===
The harbor of Ashland was dominated by the massive Wisconsin Central Railway (later Soo Line) ore dock, built in 1916 to load iron ore mined in the area into freighters bound for industrial ports in the Midwest, such as Ashtabula, Ohio, where steel was produced. The last of what had once been many such docks, the concrete structure was high and wide. In 1925 the dock was extended to ; it was last used to ship ore in 1965.

In 2007 the Wisconsin Trust for Historic Preservation named it one of the &quot;10 most endangered historic buildings in Wisconsin&quot;, a list intended to stir preservation efforts. The main concrete structure and trestle had slowly deteriorated since the early 1970s because of lack of maintenance and the effects of the environment. A structural inspection completed in 2006 and 2007 concluded that the ore dock had become structurally unsafe and was an imminent safety hazard. On May 14, 2009, the Ashland Planning Commission granted Canadian National Railway approval for demolition of the dock. All material on the ore dock was removed, down to the concrete base. This was completed in 2013.

The base of the ore dock remains. The city took ownership of it from Canadian National Railway in May 2014. It is working with a consultant group to design a redevelopment plan for the base of the dock.
