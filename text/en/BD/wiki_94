<text>The oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) is a large pelagic requiem shark inhabiting tropical and warm temperate seas. It has a stocky body with long, white-tipped, rounded fins. The species is typically solitary, though they may gather in large numbers at food concentrations. Bony fish and cephalopods are the main components of its diet and females give live birth.

Though slow-moving, the shark is opportunistic and aggressive, and is reputed to be dangerous to shipwreck survivors. The IUCN Red List considers the species to be critically endangered. Recent studies show steeply declining populations as they are harvested for their fins and meat. As with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range.

==Taxonomy==
The oceanic whitetip shark, or lesser white shark, was described in 1831 by naturalist René-Primevère Lesson, who named the shark &quot;Carcharhinus maou&quot;. It was next described by Cuban Felipe Poey in 1861 as &quot;Squalus longimanus&quot;. The name &quot;Pterolamiops longimanus&quot; has also been used. The species epithet &#x27; refers to the size of its pectoral fins (&#x27; means &quot;long hands&quot; in Latin). The oceanic whitetip shark is called many things in English: Brown Milbert&#x27;s sand bar shark, brown shark, shipwreck shark, nigano shark, oceanic white-tipped whaler, and whitetip shark.

The rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published description has priority; therefore, the valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be &quot;Carcharhinus maou&quot;. However, Lesson&#x27;s name remained forgotten for so long that &quot;Carcharhinus longimanus&quot; remains widely accepted.

==Distribution and habitat==
This shark is found worldwide between 45°N and 43°S latitude. It lives in deep, open oceans, with a temperature greater than , It prefers water temperatures above , and up to but can also be found in waters as cool as but avoids temperatures lower than this. It was once extremely common and widely distributed, and still inhabits a wide band around the globe; however, recent studies suggest that its numbers have drastically declined.

The shark spends most of its time in the upper layer of the ocean—to a depth of —and prefers off-shore, deep-ocean areas. According to longline capture data, increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks. It is sometimes found close to land, in waters as shallow as only deep, mainly around oceanic islands and narrow continental shelves.

==Description==
&quot;C. longimanus&quot;″ most distinguishing characteristics are its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger than most other shark species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark&#x27;s snout is rounded and its eyes are circular, with nictitating membranes.

The oceanic whitetip shark is a robust, large-bodied shark. The largest specimen ever caught measured at more than in length, though they usually grow up to in length and in weight. However, the all-tackle record listed by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) is for a long individual, suggesting that weight is likely much more in larger individuals. The female is typically larger than the male by . In the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s, the mean weight of oceanic whitetip sharks was . In the 1990s, the sharks of the species from the same area averaged only .

The species is grey-bronze dorsally and white ventrally. As its name suggests, most of its fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic and caudal) have white tips. Along with white tips, the fins may be mottled, and young specimens can have black marks. A saddle-like patch may be apparent between first and second dorsal fins. The shark has two kinds of teeth. Those in the mandible (lower jaw) are thinner with a serrated tip. Between 13 and 15 teeth are on either side of the jaw. The teeth in the upper jaw are triangular, but much larger and wider with entirely serrated edges—14 or 15 occur along each side. The denticles are nearly flat and wide, typically have between five and seven ridges. There is little overlap between them, revealing some skin.

==Behaviour==
The oceanic whitetip is typically solitary, though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful. It swims during the day and night. The oceanic whitetip is usually solitary and slow-moving, and tends to cruise near the top of the water column, in open water. During summer, when the water surface is warmer, oceanic whitetips tend to swim more quickly and at deeper depths. They have been observed to breach out of the water.

The species feeds mainly on pelagic cephalopods, like squid, and bony fish, such as lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, mahi-mahi, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. However, its diet can be far more varied and less selective—it is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, seabirds, gastropods, crustaceans, and marine mammal carcasses. Its feeding methods include swimming through schools of frenzied tuna with an open mouth, waiting for the fish to swim in before biting down; when whaling formerly took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were the most common scavengers of floating carcasses. Whitetips commonly compete for food with silky sharks, explaining its comparatively leisurely swimming style combined with aggressive displays. They are known to trail pilot whales since they both feed on squid.

Pilot fish, dolphinfish, and remora may follow these sharks. Evidence in the form of sucker scars on the skin of an individual filmed off Hawaii indicate that the species may also dive deep enough to battle with giant squid. Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as &quot;sea dogs&quot; and the oceanic whitetip, the most common ship-following shark. Groups often form when individuals converge on a food source. They are recorded to segregate by both sex and size. They commonly get into feeding frenzies. Oceanic whitetips gather in large numbers off Cat Island, Bahamas from winter to spring, due to the abundance of large bony fish.

==Life cycle==

Mating and birthing seems to occur in early summer in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and southwest Indian Ocean, although females captured in the Pacific have been found with embryos year round, suggesting a longer mating season there. The shark is viviparous—embryos develop &quot;in utero&quot; and are fed by a placental sac. Its gestation period lasts nine months to one year. In the northwest Atlantic, shark pups are born long while off South Africa, birth length is long. In the Pacific Ocean, newborns average long, and number two to fourteen per litter.

In one population off Brazil, sharks were recorded to grow an average of in one year, reducing to per year up to four years and then in their fifth year. Both sexes reached maturity at between the ages of six and seven and continued to grow at per year. The average length of maturity for sharks averages in the greater equatorial and southwestern Atlantic is for females and for males. In the Pacific, sharks appear to mature at four to five years. One oceanic whitetip shark was estimated to have lived 22 years.

==Interactions with humans==

Oceanographic researcher Jacques Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip as &quot;the most dangerous of all sharks&quot;. Author and big-game fisherman Ernest Hemingway depicted them as aggressive opportunists that attacked the catch of fishermen in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;. After the USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was torpedoed on 30 July 1945, some sailors who survived the sinking reportedly died from exposure to the elements and some may have died from shark bites. According to survivor accounts published in several books about sharks and shark attacks, potentially hundreds of the &quot;Indianapolis&quot; crew were eventually killed by sharks before a plane spotted them on the fifth day after the sinking. Oceanic whitetips are believed to have been responsible for most if not all of those attacks. Also during World War II, the RMS &quot;Nova Scotia&quot;, a steamship carrying about 1,000 people near South Africa, was sunk by a German submarine. One hundred and ninety-two people survived; many deaths were attributed to the whitetip. Subsequently, the species is recorded to have attacked 21 people between 1955 and 2020, including nine divers, eight swimmers, two fishermen, one shipwrecked person and one fallen pilot. Five of these attacks were fatal.

In Egypt in 2010, one oceanic whitetip was implicated in several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh, resulting in one death and four injuries to humans. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. In October 2019, an oceanic whitetip shark brutally attacked a female snorkeler off Mo&#x27;orea, French Polynesia, but the person survived. Based on eyewitness reports and examinations of the bites, the shark appears to have been acting like a predator attacking prey.

The oceanic whitetip has been kept in captivity. Among five recorded captive oceanic whitetips, the three with time records all lived for more than a year in captivity. One of these, a female in Monterey Bay Aquarium&#x27;s Outer-Bay exhibit, lived for more than three years before dying in 2003, during which it grew . The two remaining lack a time record, but grew about during their time in captivity.

==Conservation status==

As of 2019, the IUCN Red List list the oceanic whitetip shark as critically endangered, as their numbers appear to have decreased in every ocean region they inhabit. While their total global population is unknown, they are estimated to have declined by around 98 percent &quot;with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (61.2 years)&quot;.

In 1969, Lineaweaver and Backus wrote of the oceanic whitetip: &quot;[it is] extraordinarily abundant, perhaps the most abundant large animal, large being over 100 pounds [45 kg], on the face of the earth&quot;. A study focusing on the northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, using a mix of data from US pelagic longline surveys from the mid-1950s and observations from the late 1990s, estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99.3% over this period. However, changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates. According to a January 2021 study in &quot;Nature&quot; which studied 31 species of sharks and rays, the number of these species found in open oceans had dropped by 71 per cent in around 50 years. The oceanic whitetip was included in the study.

Oceanic whitetip sharks are mainly threatened by fisheries, sometimes intentional but usually bycatch. They are victims of longlines, hook-lines, gillnets and trawls. The sharks are used for their fins and meat. It is eaten fresh, smoked, dried, and salted and its skin made into leather. Bycatching of oceanic whitetip sharks may be reduced by removing hooks from longliners when they are in shallow water. Sharks may also be threatened by pollution. Those in the northwest Atlantic have been found to accumulate high amounts of mercury.

In March 2013, the oceanic whitetip was added to Appendix II of CITES meaning the species (including parts and derivatives) require CITES permits for international trade. On 30 January 2018, NOAA Fisheries published a final rule to list the oceanic whitetip shark as a threatened species under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) (83 FR 4153). From 3 January 2013, the shark was fully protected in New Zealand territorial waters under the Wildlife Act 1953. The New Zealand Department of Conservation has classified the oceanic whitetip shark as &quot;Migrant&quot; with the qualifier &quot;Secure Overseas&quot; under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

<text>On the World Wide Web, a link farm is any group of websites that all hyperlink to other sites in the group for the purpose of increasing SEO rankings. In graph theoretic terms, a link farm is a clique. Although some link farms can be created by hand, most are created through automated programs and services. A link farm is a form of spamming the index of a web search engine (sometimes called spamdexing). Other link exchange systems are designed to allow individual websites to selectively exchange links with other relevant websites, and are not considered a form of spamdexing.

Search engines require ways to confirm page relevancy. A known method is to examine for one-way links coming directly from relevant websites. The process of building links should not be confused with being listed on link farms, as the latter requires reciprocal return links, which often renders the overall backlink advantage useless. This is due to oscillation, causing confusion over which is the vendor site and which is the promoting site.

==History==
Link farms were first developed by search engine optimizers (SEOs) in 1999 to take advantage of the Inktomi search engine&#x27;s dependence upon link popularity. Although link popularity is used by some search engines to help establish a ranking order for search results, the Inktomi engine at the time maintained two indexes. Search results were produced from the primary index, which was limited to approximately 100 million listings. Pages with few inbound links fell out of the Inktomi index on a monthly basis.

Inktomi was targeted for manipulation through link farms because it was then used by several independent but popular search engines. Yahoo!, then the most popular search service, also used Inktomi results to supplement its directory search feature. The link farms helped stabilize listings, primarily for online business Websites that had few natural links from larger, more stable sites in the Inktomi index.

Link farm exchanges were at first handled on an informal basis, but several service companies were founded to provide automated registration, categorization, and link page updates to member Websites.

When the Google search engine became popular, search engine optimizers learned that Google&#x27;s ranking algorithm depended in part on a link-weighting scheme called PageRank. Rather than simply count all inbound links equally, the PageRank algorithm determines that some links may be more valuable than others, and therefore assigns them more weight than others. Link farming was adapted to help increase the PageRank of member pages.

However, the link farms became susceptible to manipulation by unscrupulous webmasters who joined the services, received inbound linkage, and then found ways to hide their outbound links or to avoid posting any links on their sites at all. Link farm managers had to implement quality controls and monitor member compliance with their rules to ensure fairness.

Alternative link farm products emerged, particularly link-finding software that identified potential reciprocal link partners, sent them template-based emails offering to exchange links, and created directory-like link pages for Websites, in the hope of building their link popularity and PageRank. These link farms are sometimes considered a spamdexing strategy.

Search engines countered the link farm movement by identifying specific attributes associated with link farm pages and filtering those pages from indexing and search results. In some cases, entire domains were removed from the search engine indexes in order to prevent them from influencing search results.

==Blog network==
A private blog network (PBN) is a group of blogs that are owned by the same entity. A blog network can either be a group of loosely connected blogs, or a group of blogs that are owned by the same company. The purpose of such a network is usually to promote other sites outside the network and therefore increase the search engine rankings or advertising revenue generated from online advertising on the sites the PBN links to.

In September 2014, Google targeted private blog networks (PBNs) with manual action ranking penalties. This served to dissuade search engine optimization and online marketers from using PBNs to increase their online rankings. The &quot;thin content&quot; warnings are closely tied to Panda which focuses on thin content and on-page quality. PBNs have a history of being targeted by Google and therefore may not be the safest option. Since Google is on the search for blog networks, they are not always linked together. In fact, interlinking your blogs could help Google, and a single exposed blog could reveal the whole blog network by looking at the outbound links.

A blog network may also refer to a central website, such as WordPress, where a user creates an account and is then able to use their own blog. The created blog forms part of a network because it uses either a subdomain or a subfolder of the main domain, although in all other ways it can be entirely autonomous. This is also known as a hosted blog platform and usually uses the free WordPress Multisite software.

Hosted blog networks are also known as Web 2.0 networks, since they became more popular with the rise of the second phase of web development.

<doc id="270233" wikidata="Q1486424" url="?curid=270233" title="GPE Palmtop Environment">
<text>GPE (a recursive acronym for GPE Palmtop Environment) is a graphical user interface environment for handheld computers, such as palmtops and personal digital assistants (PDAs), running some Linux kernel-based operating system. GPE is a complete environment of software components and applications which makes it possible to use a Linux handheld for tasks such as personal information management (PIM), audio playback, email, and web browsing.

GPE is free and open-source software, subject to the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) or the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

==Supported devices==

GPE is bundled with embedded Linux distributions targeting the following platforms:

* Sharp Zaurus
* Hewlett-Packard iPAQ
* Hewlett-Packard Jornada 72x
* Siemens AG SIMpad SL4

In addition, GPE maintainers and the open source community are developing ports for additional devices:

* GamePark Holdings GP2x
* Nokia 770
* Nokia N800
* Palm TX
* Palm Treo 650
* HTC Universal
* HTC Typhoon
* HTC Tornado
* HTC Wizard
* HTC Apache

On February 5, 2007, The GPE project announced GPE Phone Edition, a new variant of GPE developed for mobile phones.

==Software components==
GPE does not have any of the GNOME Core Applications, but instead software was written from scratch, tailored to the embedded environment. GPE is based on GTK+, and because GTK+ did not gain support for Wayland until versions 3.10, GPE uses X11 as its windowing system, e.g. with the combination X.Org Server/Matchbox.

The project provides an infrastructure for easy and powerful application development by providing core software such as shared libraries, database schemata, and building on available technology including SQLite, D-BUS, GStreamer and several of the more common standards defined by freedesktop.org.

One of the major goals of the GPE project is to encourage people to work on free software for mobile devices and to experiment with writing a GUI for embedded devices. Some of the applications already developed for GPE include:

* &quot;GPE-Contacts&quot; - A contacts manager 
* &quot;GPE-Calendar&quot; - The calendar application 
* &quot;GPE-Edit&quot; - A simple text editor 
* &quot;GPE-Filemanager&quot; - A file manager with MIME type and remote access support 
* &quot;GPE-Gallery&quot; - Small and easy to use image viewer 
* &quot;GPE-Games&quot; - A small collection of tiny games 
* &quot;GPE-Mini-Browser&quot; - A CSS and JavaScript compatible compact web browser 
* &quot;GPE-Sketchbook&quot; - Create notes and sketches 
* &quot;GPE-Soundbite&quot; - A voice memo tool
* &quot;GPE-ToDo&quot; - A task list manager
* &quot;GPE-Timesheet&quot; - Track time spend on tasks
* &quot;Starling&quot; - A GStreamer based audio player

GPE&#x27;s PIM applications (GPE-Contacts, GPE-Calendar, GPE-ToDo) can be synchronized with their desktop and web counterparts (such as Novell Evolution, Mozilla Sunbird and Google Calendar) through the use of &quot;GPE-Syncd&quot; and the OpenSync framework.

GPE also contains a number of GUI utilities for configuring 802.11 Wireless LAN, Bluetooth, IrDA, Firewall, ALSA, Package Management, among others.

A mobile push e-mail client based on the Tinymail framework is in development.

==Linux distributions==
GPE can be found as a primary environment in the following embedded Linux distributions:

* OpenEmbedded (ex OpenZaurus)
* Ångström
* Familiar Linux

Though it may not be as highly supported as the distributions listed above, GPE is also available through package management utilities in the following distributions:

* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Internet Tablet OS

==Controversy==

There are ongoing controversies surrounding the GPE project regarding a change of hosting service, ownership of an IRC channel, and a trademark dispute.

===Web hosting===

Serious issues first began developing over a proposed change of hosting service. GPE had been hosted at Handhelds.org since April 2002. Some of GPE&#x27;s developers suggested, and later followed through with, a move to Linuxtogo.org by October 2006. Handhelds.org responded by removing the user accounts of the departing developers, and any links or reference to the new GPE Linuxtogo.org location on the original GPE Handhelds.org site.

===Trademark===

George France, has filed for trademark registration with the USPTO for GPE, in addition to OPIE and Ipkg as of March 6, 2007. On June 25, 2007, the USPTO declined to accept a screenshot of the Handhelds.org GPE website as proof of Handhelds.org&#x27;s ownership, and in addition requested a better specimen for a “GPE product”. Handhelds.org, and OSI board member Russ Nelson, assert that the GPE project was given over to Handhelds.org for public development.

The GPE developers working at Linuxtogo.org maintain that they represent the active GPE project, and Handhelds.org was only a hosting provider. Furthermore, they point out that the GPE project existed before it was hosted on Handhelds.org.

The USPTO issued a final rejection regarding the GPE trademark on February 27, 2008. George France amended the application (removing references to GNU and Linux). The GPE trademark was officially published for opposition June 3, 2008.

Despite George France&#x27;s impending personal GPE trademark, the core GPE development team at Linuxtogo.org has abandoned much of the Handhelds.org GPE infrastructure. Linuxtogo.org developers have switched GPE to a new bootloader and replaced IPKG with OPKG, and made major changes to the GPE gui applications.

The Trademark of GPE was registered to George France on Aug 19, 2008 by the USPTO.

<doc id="270244" wikidata="Q334376" url="?curid=270244" title="Margo MacDonald">
<text>Margo Symington MacDonald (&quot;née&quot; Aitken; 19 April 1943 – 4 April 2014) was a Scottish politician, teacher and broadcaster. She was the Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Govan from 1973 to 1974 and was Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party from 1974 to 1979. She later served as an SNP and then Independent Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Lothian from 1999 until her death.

==Background==
Margo Symington Aitken was born in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, and grew up in and around East Kilbride, one of three siblings.

Her mother, Jean, was a nurse, and her father, Robert, was described as a &quot;very cruel&quot; man from whom her mother separated when Margo was 12 years old. She was educated at Hamilton Academy, and trained as a teacher of physical education at Dunfermline College of Physical Education immediately after leaving school.

==Family==
She married her first husband, Peter MacDonald, in 1965, and they ran a Blantyre pub, the Barnhill Tavern (known locally as The Hoolet&#x27;s Nest), together. The MacDonalds had two daughters, Petra and Zoe, before the marriage ended in divorce.

Her second marriage was to politician and columnist Jim Sillars, whom she married in 1981. Sillars went on to win the 1988 Glasgow Govan by-election for the SNP. Petra MacDonald married Craig Reid of the Proclaimers; the Reids have four children.

==Parliamentary career==
A committed and vocal supporter of Scottish independence, MacDonald entered parliamentary politics by winning the 1973 Glasgow Govan by-election as an SNP candidate at 30 years old. There were &quot;scenes of near-hysteria by supporters&quot; as she was declared the winner in what had, until then, been a Labour stronghold. Her election, during the last months of the Conservative Heath government, &quot;overturned the theory that the SNP can thrive only [...] when a Labour Government is in office&quot;.

She has alleged that her election to the House of Commons was followed by KGB and CIA agents taking her for lunch while posing as journalists, and believed the SNP was infiltrated during the 1970s by MI5 agents worried booming North Sea oil revenues could lead to independence.

She failed to retain her seat in the following general election of February 1974, but became Deputy Leader of the SNP that year. At a December 1974 National Council meeting, MacDonald criticised the SNP for failing to win seats from Labour in industrial Scotland and urged the party to move to the left to compete. She had already been selected as the SNP candidate in Hamilton when the death of the MP led to the 1978 Hamilton by-election, which she lost. At the 1979 general election she was an unsuccessful candidate in Glasgow Shettleston.

A staunch left-winger, she was one of three prominent spokespersons for the socialist 79 Group, which ultimately resulted in her failure to be re-elected as Deputy Leader at the party&#x27;s 1979 conference. In 1982, Margo resigned from the SNP in protest of the 79 Group&#x27;s proscription. She began to establish herself as a forceful and respected presenter of various radio and television programmes, including the short-lived &quot;Colour Supplement&quot; for Radio 4 in the mid-1980s. She contributed regularly to Scottish newspapers including the &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; near the end of her life.

By the mid-1990s, she had returned to the SNP and in 1999 she was elected to the Scottish Parliament, representing the Lothians. She earned a high media profile by her outspoken views on a number of issues, including sex workers&#x27; rights and MSPs&#x27; salaries. She quickly established herself as a rebel within the party, and was disciplined in 2000 for missing a parliamentary vote without permission and briefing a Sunday newspaper against party policy. Meanwhile, she lost influence with the party leadership, firstly under Alex Salmond and then John Swinney, for being in the SNP Fundamentalist mould and having supported Alex Neil in the party leadership election in 2000.

In 2002, MacDonald was ranked fifth on the SNP list for Lothians for the 2003 Parliament election, effectively ending her chances of being re-elected as an SNP MSP. In response, there were a spate of resignations from the party, and MacDonald decided to instead stand as an independent. For this, she was officially expelled from the SNP on 28 January 2003. Her diagnosis with Parkinson&#x27;s disease became public knowledge at this time, ostensibly in an effort to diminish her electoral prospects. MacDonald, who had known about the diagnosis for six years, said it had been leaked to the press by &quot;forces of darkness&quot; in the SNP, but a spokesperson insisted that the leak did not come from within the party.

She was re-elected as an independent MSP at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, and again in 2007 and 2011. After her 2007 re-election MacDonald stood to become Presiding Officer, but lost the ballot to Alex Fergusson. During her time in parliament as an independent politician, she championed controversial causes, including the legalisation of assisted suicide.

In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, MacDonald asked the UK&#x27;s Security Service for assurances they would not interfere in the referendum process, suggesting that the security services &quot;have people in the SNP&quot;.

==Death==
MacDonald died at her home in Edinburgh on 4 April 2014, aged 70. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, according to the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998, her seat was left vacant until the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. Shortly after her death, it was confirmed that political leaders would pay tribute to her at a special session of the parliament.

==&quot;My Right to Die&quot;==
In July 2008, MacDonald co-operated with BBC Scotland in the making of a documentary about assisted dying. As someone with Parkinson&#x27;s, MacDonald had long been a campaigner for assisted dying, saying that 

In the programme, MacDonald travelled around Scotland and met fellow &quot;sufferers&quot; and investigated the pros and cons of assisted dying, later stating that

<text>Anthony George Banks (born 27 March 1950) is an English musician primarily known as the keyboardist and founding member of the rock band Genesis. Banks is also a prolific solo artist, releasing six solo studio albums that range through progressive rock, pop, and classical music.

Banks co-founded Genesis in 1967 while studying at Charterhouse. He was their keyboardist and one of their principal songwriters and lyricists. He became a frequent user of the Hammond T-102 organ, Mellotron, ARP Pro Soloist and Yamaha CP-70 piano. In the band&#x27;s earliest years Banks would play acoustic guitar for some of the mellow and pastoral songs.

In 2010, Banks was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis. In 2011, he was included on MusicRadar&#x27;s list of the 27 greatest keyboard players of all time. In 2015, he was named &quot;Prog God&quot; at the Progressive Music Awards.

==Early life==
Anthony George Banks was born on 27 March 1950 in East Hoathly with Halland, East Sussex as the youngest of five children. He cites his mother, a pianist, as being particularly into music, and first listened to classical music albums that she owned from around six before he moved to musical theatre compositions by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Banks&#x27;s elder brother introduced him to a wider variety, naming &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; sung by Frankie Laine as one of the songs, and said, &quot;By 1961, and for the next five to six years, I was music mad!&quot; Banks started piano lessons at school at eight with the headmaster&#x27;s wife, but did not enjoy tuition at first because he was &quot;quite forced into it&quot; by his parents until he grew to enjoy it. He considered himself an average piano player, and learned to play pieces by Sergei Rachmaninoff and Maurice Ravel, his two favourite piano composers, by ear. At 13, he began lessons with an unsuitable teacher who made him lose interest in classical music, but he then started to play songs by ear that he heard on the radio. Months later, he acquired a new piano teacher who sparked his interest in classical compositions once more, which became a deciding factor for Banks&#x27;s decision to pursue a career in music. In addition to the piano, Banks taught himself to play the guitar.

At seven, Banks began six years of study at Boarzell Preparatory School, a boarding school in Hurst Green. In September 1963, Banks began study at Charterhouse School, a private school in Godalming, Surrey. He studied classical piano as an extracurricular subject. Shortly after his arrival he befriended fellow pupil and future Genesis bandmate Peter Gabriel, initially over their general distaste for the school&#x27;s environment. They went on to play in Garden Wall, a school band with drummer Chris Stewart. In early 1967, they merged with guitarists Mike Rutherford and Anthony Phillips, two members of Anon, another school band, to record a series of demos which led to the formation of their new band Genesis.

Banks originally planned to study mathematics in higher education. After leaving Charterhouse, Banks began studying chemistry at Sussex University but soon switched to physics and philosophy. After a year at Sussex, he took a leave of absence in 1969 to explore a career with Genesis since the group had split but decided to reform and become a full-time professional band. Banks never returned to the university.

==Career==
===1967–2007: Genesis===
Banks&#x27;s elaborate arrangements and keyboard solos (such as the piano introduction to &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; and the instrumental sections of &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;, &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;, and &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;) helped to establish Genesis&#x27;s sound. In addition to playing keyboards, Banks contributed (along with Anthony Phillips, Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford) to Genesis&#x27;s 12-string acoustic passages in songs such as &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, &quot;Entangled&quot;, &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;, and the beginning part of &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;. Banks also was an occasional back-up vocalist and sang lead vocal on part of &quot;Shepherd&quot;, a song from 1970 which was only released on the &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot; boxed set. Though Genesis&#x27;s practice was to write songs as a group, Banks would on occasion bring to the group a completed song and not allow the other members to add anything to it, starting with &quot;Time Table&quot; on &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972). Notable Banks-penned Genesis songs include the minor hit &quot;Many Too Many&quot; and the anthemic ballad &quot;Afterglow&quot;, which remained a popular coda to the Banks-driven medleys that the group played during live shows for years.

Initially Banks played only piano and backing vocals with Genesis, but by the time of &quot;Trespass&quot; (1970) he had expanded his keyboards repertoire to include Hammond organ and Mellotron. According to Phillips, Banks had an especially difficult time adapting to the organ, which he called &quot;a box of tricks&quot;. Banks said he found both the Hammond organ and Mellotron rather limited once he got a handle on them, and acquiring more advanced synthesizers such as the ARP Pro Soloist (which he first used on the 1973 album &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;) opened up a wide range of possibilities for him.

Original lead singer Peter Gabriel was both Banks&#x27;s best friend within Genesis and the member he feuded with most frequently. Gabriel recalled, &quot;We were used to having this passive-aggressive tone to rehearsals and, although Tony and I were best friends, we would often be at loggerheads about the music. He was a lot more nervous back then and not at ease within himself. ... Without question, we were passionate about creating something great, but I think we were also both awkward buggers, so it was a personality thing as well.&quot;

In 1997, Banks turned down an invitation to play on Steve Hackett&#x27;s solo album &quot;Genesis Revisited&quot; as he disliked going over past material and an appearance would have added confusion to the fact that Genesis were close to putting out &quot;Calling All Stations&quot;.

After Genesis split in 1998, Banks&#x27;s career stagnated, and he considered retirement from music. It was during this time that he began composing, titling an early piece &quot;Black Down&quot; which led to his decision to pursue orchestra composition.

===1978–present: Solo projects===
====Rock albums====
Banks first thought of making a solo album in 1975, following Gabriel&#x27;s departure from Genesis. He had a group of songs in development at the time which were used on &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; (1976), their first album recorded without Gabriel, including &quot;Mad Man Moon&quot; and sections of &quot;Entangled&quot; and &quot;Ripples&quot;.

In 1979, after Genesis had entered a break in activity, Banks and Rutherford travelled to Polar Studios in Stockholm and recorded their first studio albums. Banks&#x27;s album, &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot;, was released first in October of that year. It was originally meant to be based on and titled after the short story &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes, and Banks had written a complete set of lyrics for the story, but shelved the idea after he was made aware of an upcoming musical about the book. In addition to keyboards Banks played the guitar and bass as he wanted the album to be &quot;As personal as possible&quot;. He enlisted Kim Beacon of String Driven Thing as vocalist.

In June 1983, Banks released his second studio album, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. It remains his only album to feature him as lead vocalist on all of the songs, a role he considered after recording guide vocals for Phil Collins to sing for &quot;Me and Sarah Jane&quot; and &quot;Keep It Dark&quot; on the Genesis album &quot;Abacab&quot; (1981). Banks has employed guest vocalists on his solo albums; these have included Fish, Nik Kershaw, Toyah Willcox, Jack Hues and Jim Diamond.

In 1988, Banks recorded a pop and rock-oriented album under the group identity Bankstatement, featuring guitarist and co-producer Steve Hillage and singers Alistair Gordon and Jayney Klimek, plus additional musicians. Banks felt inspired to pursue the project having witnessed Rutherford enjoy the success of his own group, Mike + the Mechanics. Their eponymously-titled album was released in 1989. Banks also performed lead vocals on the song &quot;Big Man.&quot;

Banks released his fourth studio album, &quot;Still&quot;, in April 1991 featuring Fish and Nik Kershaw. In contrast to his previous use of one or two vocalists on an album, he chose a greater number for &quot;Still&quot; as he saw little point in restricting himself and selected different people for tracks they suited best. As on the previous album, Banks took the lead vocal on one track (Hero For an Hour)

Banks formed his second group project outside Genesis in 1994. He initially wanted to name the band Incognito, but found out there was another group with the name and chose Strictly Inc. It featured him with Wang Chung vocalist Jack Hues, and their eponymously-titled album saw a UK release in September 1995.

In 2004, after recording his classical album &quot;Seven&quot;, Banks expressed an interest in recording another rock solo album but decided that the environment was becoming increasingly difficult in terms of securing a deal; yet the likelihood of it solely being an independent or online release did appeal to him. He added: &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to prove anything. I haven&#x27;t got to convince anybody. I don&#x27;t have to worry about reviews or anything like that. You are just doing it for people who are familiar with what you are doing&quot;.

====Film scores====
In 1978, Banks and Rutherford were asked by musician and producer Rupert Hine to write music for the horror film &quot;The Shout&quot; (1978), after David Bowie was originally booked but failed to attend sessions. Hine recommended Genesis, and organised recording in a church without Collins as he was unavailable at short notice. The main theme that they developed was later featured on &quot;From the Undertow&quot; on Banks&#x27;s solo album &quot;A Curious Feeling&quot;.

Banks&#x27;s first major film score was for the 1983 loose remake &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1983), for director Michael Winner. The soundtrack was released in April 1983 on Atlantic Records.

Around 1983, Banks was asked by director Peter Hyams to score the soundtrack to &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact&quot; (1984), the sequel to the popular science fiction film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), having liked his work for &quot;The Shout&quot;. However, the &quot;masses&quot; of music Banks had written was poorly received by Hyams which led to his departure from the project, leaving Banks disappointed. With months to spare, Banks accepted the job of scoring another science fiction film, &quot;Lorca and the Outlaws&quot; (1984), which came with no salary. Its low budget prevented Banks from using a professional studio, so he wrote the music using his own 16-track machine.

His next soundtrack was the drama film &quot;Quicksilver&quot; (1986). Banks recalled the directors were more supportive towards him and the process went smoothly, but disliked their demand for more straightforward songs on the soundtrack in order to have a hit single that they could release. Among the tracks recorded was &quot;Shortcut to Somewhere&quot;, a collaboration with Marillion singer Fish, which became the only single from Banks&#x27;s solo career to chart in the UK when it reached number 75.

Selections of music written for &quot;Lorca and the Outlaws&quot; and &quot;Quicksilver&quot; were later released on Banks&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Soundtracks&quot; (1986).

====Classical albums====
Banks became interested in the music of Gustav Mahler after hearing it in the film &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1971). He also cites Dmitri Shostakovich and Erik Satie as composers whose music he has enjoyed. He identifies Symphony No. 4 in A minor and Symphony No. 7 in C major by Jean Sibelius, and Symphony No. 5 in D major by Ralph Vaughan Williams as favourite pieces. Critics have noted that Vaughan Williams and film composer John Barry are notable influences on his own orchestral compositions. Banks has acknowledged similarities in style between his orchestral works and those of Vaughan Williams, Sibelius and Barry.

In March 2004, Banks released his fourth studio album, and first of entirely classical music, entitled &quot;Seven: A Suite for Orchestra&quot; on Naxos Records. He had the idea for the album around six years prior to starting working on it, and felt encouraged after hearing the orchestral arrangements of his compositions for the soundtrack to &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;. It features seven compositions performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra with Banks on the piano for three tracks with conductor Mike Dixon.

On 26 March 2012, Banks&#x27;s second classical album was released (also on Naxos), entitled &quot;Six Pieces for Orchestra&quot;, performed by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Paul Englishby. Tracks are: &quot;Siren&quot; featuring Martin Robertson on alto saxophone, &quot;Still Waters&quot;, &quot;Blade&quot; with Charlie Siem on violin, &quot;Wild Pilgrimage&quot;, &quot;The Oracle&quot; and &quot;City of Gold&quot;.

Banks&#x27;s third classical music album, &quot;Five&quot;, was released in February 2018. As he related in the album&#x27;s booklet, &quot;In 2013, I was approached to write a piece for the following year&#x27;s Cheltenham Music Festival, which I readily agreed to as this seemed a good opportunity for me to have one of my orchestral pieces played live, which had not happened before...since then I have written more music, creating this suite...&quot;. It features five pieces performed by The Czech National Symphony Orchestra and Choir conducted by Nick Ingman, and Banks on piano and celeste.

Other recent projects includes writing music for operatic tenor John Potter and to a Shakespeare sonnet.

==Reception==
Music historian Wayne Studer has referred to Banks as &quot;the most tasteful keyboardist of prog rock.&quot; Scott Solida of MusicRadar also described him as &quot;tasteful and often restrained&quot;, whose &quot;playing was always in service to the song.&quot; Solida added, &quot;Banks exhibited a sense of arrangement and purpose so often missing in the excesses of his peers.&quot; In 2018, Philip Wilding of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; described Banks as &quot;the most overlooked solo artist from Genesis&quot;.

Banks has pioneered many unique keyboard and synthesizer sounds throughout his career; one of his achievements was the technique of using the trigger output of a Linn LM-1 drum machine to have the hi-hat pattern trigger an ARP Quadra synthesizer, creating such parts as the pulsating drum sound in &quot;Mama&quot; (from 1983&#x27;s &quot;Genesis&quot;) and &quot;By You&quot; on &quot;The Fugitive&quot; (1983). Another unique synth technique was used on the track &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; from the 1981 album &quot;Abacab&quot;; a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 was programmed with a few sounds, and the patches were switched manually (via the panel preset tabs) while he played.

Known for his lack of flamboyance on stage, Banks did wear a snorkel for performances of &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; on the &quot;Abacab&quot; tour.

== Instruments ==
Banks, who has played the piano for many years, achieved a distinctive sound by running all of his keyboards (as well as his 12-string guitar) into a mixing board and then running the signal output of the board into a Leslie speaker This can clearly be heard on everything Banks plays on the &quot;Genesis Live&quot; album.

Banks&#x27;s earliest setup included a Hammond L-100 organ, a Hohner Pianet N and a Mellotron MkII, all of which (as well as grand piano) are first heard on the &quot;Trespass&quot; album. Banks used the Pianet as both a substitute for a grand piano, and also as a lead instrument, with the use of a fuzz box (also homemade, similar to the Fender Blender). He would often duel with Hackett&#x27;s guitar, as heard on tracks like &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot;, and &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;. Banks in 1974 switched from his Pianet to an RMI 368 Electra Piano and Harpsichord, which was soon integrated into the sound of Genesis, as first heard at various points on &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974) album. It was often effected with the homemade fuzz box and an MXR Phase 100 – later these pedals were inserted in the panel of the Electra Piano.
In 1978, the RMI was replaced with the Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano.

The first synthesizer used by Banks was the monophonic ARP Pro Soloist, which Banks first acquired in 1973 along with a Hammond T-102 and a Mellotron M400 for the &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; album, replacing the Hammond L122 and the Mellotron MkII. With the release of the &quot;Trick of the Tail&quot; album in 1976 and onward, Banks made use of the ARP 2600, a semi-modular synthesizer. On 1978&#x27;s &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; the Polymoog (one of the first polyphonic synthesizers) was integrated into Banks&#x27; expansive array, which enabled more expressive and highly layered &quot;colorful&quot; textures along with his unique use of MXR Phase 100 and Boss CE-1 Chorus effects pedals on the Hammond T-102 organ. During this time, he also added a Roland RS-202 string and brass synthesizer to mainly replace the Mellotron, though not used live. He also briefly used a Fender Rhodes electric piano. He also acquired a Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano, which, when put through a Boss chorus, would become a signature part of Banks&#x27; 1970&#x27;s - 80&#x27;s sound.

He used this technique all the way up to &quot;Duke&quot; in 1980, when he made a major overhaul of his rig, dropping the ARP 2600, the ARP Pro-Soloist, the Mellotron and the RS-202 in favour of a Yamaha CS-80, a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, an ARP Quadra and a Roland VP-330. On &quot;Abacab&quot; in 1981, the organ was no longer featured; organ sounds were emulated using a Sequential Circuits Prophet 10 synthesizer through the Boss CE-1. For the album &quot;Genesis&quot; in 1983, he replaced the Polymoog with an E-mu Emulator digital sampler. He also added a NED Synclavier II, which also has had prominent features in Banks&#x27; career, such as on &quot;Home by the Sea&quot;. His final changes in this rig were replacing the E-mu Emulator with an E-mu Emulator II+ and the Roland VP-330 with a Yamaha DX7 for &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;. Since the &quot;We Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1991) album, Banks has favoured Roland and Korg synthesizers, such as Roland JD-800 and Korg Wavestation.

Evolving technology and sampling has allowed him to use a smaller rig of 4 or 3 keyboards with an array of rack mounted synth modules to emulate many of the earlier sounds. His concert rigs since &quot;When in Rome 2007&quot; include Korg Wavestation and Roland A-90 keyboard acting as MIDI controllers for rack mounted Korg Wavestation SR, Roland JD-990, Yamaha TX7, E-mu Proteus I and II, and E-mu EIV, as well as Korg OASYS as a master keyboard.

== Personal life ==
Banks married Margaret McBain on 29 July 1972. They had a one-day honeymoon as Banks was too busy with finishing the Genesis album &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. Banks said: &quot;The band felt sorry for me so they paid for her to come on the next tour&quot;. The couple has two children.

<text>Double Data Rate 2 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR2 SDRAM) is a double data rate (DDR) synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) interface. It is a JEDEC standard (JESD79-2); first published in September 2003. DDR2 succeeded the original DDR SDRAM specification, and was itself succeeded by DDR3 SDRAM in 2007. DDR2 DIMMs are neither forward compatible with DDR3 nor backward compatible with DDR.

In addition to double pumping the data bus as in DDR SDRAM (transferring data on the rising and falling edges of the bus clock signal), DDR2 allows higher bus speed and requires lower power by running the internal clock at half the speed of the data bus. The two factors combine to produce a total of four data transfers per internal clock cycle.

Since the DDR2 internal clock runs at half the DDR external clock rate, DDR2 memory operating at the same external data bus clock rate as DDR results in DDR2 being able to provide the same bandwidth but with better latency. Alternatively, DDR2 memory operating at twice the external data bus clock rate as DDR may provide twice the bandwidth with the same latency. The best-rated DDR2 memory modules are at least twice as fast as the best-rated DDR memory modules.
The maximum capacity on commercially available DDR2 DIMMs is 8GB, but chipset support and availability for those DIMMs is sparse and more common 2GB per DIMM are used.

== History ==
DDR2 SDRAM was first produced by Samsung in 2001. In 2003, the JEDEC standards organization presented Samsung with its Technical Recognition Award for the company&#x27;s efforts in developing and standardizing DDR2.

DDR2 was officially introduced in the second quarter of 2003 at two initial clock rates: 200 MHz (referred to as PC2-3200) and 266 MHz (PC2-4200). Both performed worse than the original DDR specification due to higher latency, which made total access times longer. However, the original DDR technology tops out at a clock rate around 200 MHz (400 MT/s). Higher performance DDR chips exist, but JEDEC has stated that they will not be standardized. These chips are mostly standard DDR chips that have been tested and rated to be capable of operation at higher clock rates by the manufacturer. Such chips draw significantly more power than slower-clocked chips, but usually offered little or no improvement in real-world performance, unless bandwidth dependent tasks such as integrated graphics rendering are used. DDR2 started to become competitive against the older DDR standard by the end of 2004, as modules with lower latencies became available.

== Specification ==

=== Overview ===


The key difference between DDR2 and DDR SDRAM is the increase in prefetch length. In DDR SDRAM, the prefetch length was two bits for every bit in a word; whereas it is four bits in DDR2 SDRAM. During an access, four bits were read or written to or from a four-bit-deep prefetch queue. This queue received or transmitted its data over the data bus in two data bus clock cycles (each clock cycle transferred two bits of data). Increasing the prefetch length allowed DDR2 SDRAM to double the rate at which data could be transferred over the data bus without a corresponding doubling in the rate at which the DRAM array could be accessed. DDR2 SDRAM was designed with such a scheme to avoid an excessive increase in power consumption.

DDR2&#x27;s bus frequency is boosted by electrical interface improvements, on-die termination, prefetch buffers and off-chip drivers. However, latency is greatly increased as a trade-off. The DDR2 prefetch buffer is four bits deep, whereas it is two bits deep for DDR. While DDR SDRAM has typical read latencies of between two and three bus cycles, DDR2 may have read latencies between three and nine cycles, although the typical range is between four and six. Thus, DDR2 memory must be operated at twice the data rate to achieve the same latency.

Another cost of the increased bandwidth is the requirement that the chips are packaged in a more expensive and difficult to assemble BGA package as compared to the TSSOP package of the previous memory generations such as DDR SDRAM and SDR SDRAM. This packaging change was necessary to maintain signal integrity at higher bus speeds.

Power savings are achieved primarily due to an improved manufacturing process through die shrinkage, resulting in a drop in operating voltage (1.8 V compared to DDR&#x27;s 2.5 V). The lower memory clock frequency may also enable power reductions in applications that do not require the highest available data rates.

According to JEDEC the maximum recommended voltage is 1.9 volts and should be considered the absolute maximum when memory stability is an issue (such as in servers or other mission critical devices). In addition, JEDEC states that memory modules must withstand up to 2.3 volts before incurring permanent damage (although they may not actually function correctly at that level).

=== Chips and modules ===
For use in computers, DDR2 SDRAM is supplied in DIMMs with 240 pins and a single locating notch. Laptop DDR2 SO-DIMMs have 200 pins and often come identified by an additional S in their designation. DIMMs are identified by their peak transfer capacity (often called bandwidth).


* &quot;Some manufacturers label their DDR2 modules as PC2-4300, PC2-5400 or PC2-8600 instead of the respective names suggested by JEDEC. At least one manufacturer has reported this reflects successful testing at a higher-than-standard data rate whilst others simply round up for the name.&quot;

Note: DDR2-xxx denotes data transfer rate, and describes raw DDR chips, whereas PC2-xxxx denotes theoretical bandwidth (with the last two digits truncated), and is used to describe assembled DIMMs. Bandwidth is calculated by taking transfers per second and multiplying by eight. This is because DDR2 memory modules transfer data on a bus that is 64 data bits wide, and since a byte comprises 8 bits, this equates to 8 bytes of data per transfer.
In addition to bandwidth and capacity variants, modules can:

# Optionally implement ECC, which is an extra data byte lane used for correcting minor errors and detecting major errors for better reliability. Modules with ECC are identified by an additional ECC in their designation. PC2-4200 ECC is a PC2-4200 module with ECC. An additional &quot;P&quot; can be added at the end of the designation, P standing for parity (ex : PC2-5300P).
# Be &quot;registered&quot; (&quot;buffered&quot;), which improves signal integrity (and hence potentially clock rates and physical slot capacity) by electrically buffering the signals at a cost of an extra clock of increased latency. Those modules are identified by an additional R in their designation, whereas non-registered (a.k.a. &quot;unbuffered&quot;) RAM &quot;may be&quot; identified by an additional U in the designation. PC2-4200R is a registered PC2-4200 module, PC2-4200R ECC is the same module but with additional ECC. 
# Be aware fully buffered modules, which are designated by F or FB do not have the same notch position as other classes. Fully buffered modules cannot be used with motherboards that are made for registered modules, and the different notch position physically prevents their insertion.

Note: 
* Registered and un-buffered SDRAM generally cannot be mixed on the same channel.
* The highest-rated DDR2 modules in 2009 operate at 533 MHz (1066 MT/s), compared to the highest-rated DDR modules operating at 200 MHz (400 MT/s). At the same time, the CAS latency of 11.2 ns = 6 / (bus clock rate) for the best PC2-8500 modules is comparable to that of 10 ns = 4 / (bus clock rate) for the best PC-3200 modules.

=== Backward compatibility ===
DDR2 DIMMs are not backward compatible with DDR DIMMs. The notch on DDR2 DIMMs is in a different position from DDR DIMMs, and the pin density is higher than DDR DIMMs in desktops. DDR2 is a 240-pin module, DDR is a 184-pin module. Notebooks have 200-pin SO-DIMMs for DDR and DDR2; however, the notch on DDR2 modules is in a slightly different position than on DDR modules.

Higher-speed DDR2 DIMMs can be mixed with lower-speed DDR2 DIMMs, although the memory controller will operate all DIMMs at same speed as the lowest-speed DIMM present.

== Relation to GDDR memory ==
GDDR2, a form of GDDR SDRAM, was developed by Samsung and introduced in July 2002. The first commercial product to claim using the &quot;DDR2&quot; technology was the Nvidia GeForce FX 5800 graphics card. However, this GDDR2 memory used on graphics cards is not DDR2 per se, but rather an early midpoint between DDR and DDR2 technologies. Using &quot;DDR2&quot; to refer to GDDR2 is a colloquial misnomer. In particular, the performance-enhancing doubling of the I/O clock rate is missing. It had severe overheating issues due to the nominal DDR voltages. ATI has since designed the GDDR technology further into GDDR3, which is based on DDR2 SDRAM, though with several additions suited for graphics cards.

GDDR3 was commonly used in graphics cards and some tablet PCs. However, further confusion has been added to the mix with the appearance of budget and mid-range graphics cards which claim to use &quot;GDDR2&quot;. These cards actually use standard DDR2 chips designed for use as main system memory although operating with higher latencies to achieve higher clock rates. These chips cannot achieve the clock rates of GDDR3 but are inexpensive and fast enough to be used as memory on mid-range cards.

<text>Tetrazene is a chemical compound with the molecular formula H2NN=NNH2. It is a colorless explosive material. An analogue is the organosilicon derivative (tms)2NN=NN(tms)2 where tms is trimethylsilyl. Isomeric with tetrazine is ammonium azide.

Tetrazene explosive, commonly known simply as tetrazene, is used for sensitization of priming compositions.

==Properties==
Tetrazene has eleven isomers. The most stable of these is the straight-chain 2-tetrazene (H2N-N=N-NH2), having a standard heat of formation at 301.3 kJ/mol. The eleven isomers can be arranged into three groups: straight-chain tetrazenes, four-membered cyclotetrazane, and three-membered cyclotriazanes. Each straight-chain tetrazene isomer possesses one N=N double bond and two N-N single bonds. Tautomerizations do occur between the isomers. The ionic compound ammonium azide is also a constitutional isomer of tetrazene.

==Organometallic derivatives==
A variety of coordination complexes are known for R2N42- (R = methyl, benzyl).

<text>Yaddo is an artists&#x27; community located on a estate in Saratoga Springs, New York. Its mission is &quot;to nurture the creative process by providing an opportunity for artists to work without interruption in a supportive environment.&quot; On March 11, 2013 it was designated a National Historic Landmark.

It offers residencies to artists working in choreography, film, literature, musical composition, painting, performance art, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video. Collectively, artists who have worked at Yaddo have won 82 Pulitzer Prizes, 34 MacArthur Fellowships, 70 National Book Awards, 24 National Book Critics Circle Awards, 108 Rome Prizes, 49 Whiting Writers&#x27; Awards, a Nobel Prize (Saul Bellow, who won the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976), at least one Man Booker Prize (Alan Hollinghurst, 2004) and countless other honors. Yaddo is included in the Union Avenue Historic District.

==History==
The estate was purchased in 1881 by the financier Spencer Trask and his wife, the writer Katrina Trask. The first mansion on the property burned down in 1891, and the Trasks then built the current house. Yaddo is a neologism invented by one of the Trask children and was meant to rhyme with &quot;shadow&quot;.

===Artists&#x27; colony===

In 1900, after the premature deaths of the Trasks&#x27; four children, Spencer Trask decided to turn the estate into an artists&#x27; retreat as a gift to his wife. He did this with the financial assistance of philanthropist George Foster Peabody. The first artists arrived in 1926. The success of Yaddo encouraged Spencer and Katrina later to donate land for a working women&#x27;s retreat center as well, known as Wiawaka Holiday House, at the request of Mary Wiltsie Fuller. At least in its early years, Yaddo was funded by profits from the Bowling Green Offices Building in Manhattan, in which Spencer Trask was extensively involved.

In 1949 during the McCarthy Era, a news story accurately accused writer Agnes Smedley of spying for the Soviet Union. Smedley had traveled with Mao Zedong to report on the Chinese Communist Revolution and, beginning in 1943, had spent five years at Yaddo. Poet Robert Lowell pushed the Board of Directors to oust Yaddo&#x27;s director, Elizabeth Ames, who was being questioned by the FBI. Ames was eventually exonerated of all charges but learned from the investigation that her assistant Mary Townsend was an FBI informant. Ames remained director until her retirement in 1969, having overseen the Yaddo community from its creation in 1924. Ames was succeeded by Newman E. Waite who served as president from 1969 until 1977 when Curtis Harnack assumed the position.

Literary critic and eventual Yaddo board member Louis Kronenberger wrote in his memoir that to call Yaddo &quot;a mixture of some of the most attractive, enjoyable, generous-minded people and of others who were weird, megalomaniac, intransigent, pugnacious is only to say that it has housed and nourished most of the finest talents in the arts of the past forty-odd years—the immensely fruitful years of Elizabeth Ames&#x27;s directorship.&quot;

=== Recent years ===
In May 2005, vandals, using paintball guns, damaged two of the Four Seasons statues, the Poet&#x27;s Bench, a fountain, and pathways with blue paint. Repairs cost $1,400. In 2018, Yaddo elected photographer Peter Kayafas and novelist Janice Y.K. Lee as co-chairs of its board of directors.

Yaddo has received large contributions from Spencer Trask &amp; Company and Kevin Kimberlin, the firm&#x27;s current chairman. Novelist Patricia Highsmith bequeathed her estate, valued at $3 million, to the community.

== Facilities and gardens ==

Yaddo&#x27;s gardens are modeled after the classical Italian gardens the Trasks had visited in Europe. The Four Seasons statues were acquired and installed in the garden in 1909. There are many statues and sculptures located within the estate, including a sundial that bears the inscription, &quot;Hours fly, Flowers die, New days, New ways, Pass by, Love stays.&quot; While visitors are not admitted to the main mansion or artists&#x27; residences, they may visit the gardens.

== In popular culture==
Jonathan Ames&#x27; book &quot;Wake Up Sir!&quot; (2004) is partially set at Yaddo.

&quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot; (1941), a novel by 1930s Yaddo resident Kenneth Fearing, takes place in Demarest Hall, an art colony modeled after Yaddo.

In &quot;You&quot; season 1, episode 8: &quot;You Got Me Babe&quot;, Blythe helps Beck focus on writing and break through writer&#x27;s block by disconnecting Beck from her cellphone and the Internet, and setting up Beck&#x27;s apartment to make her &quot;own Yaddo&quot;.

Yaddo is mentioned repeatedly throughout the Theresa Rebeck play &quot;Seminar&quot;.

In the 2018 Netflix comedy-drama &quot;Private Life&quot;, aspiring writer Sadie (played by Kayli Carter) gets the opportunity to spend a month at Yaddo to focus on refining her writing skills. It is also repeatedly mentioned and referenced throughout the movie, e.g. by a coffee mug showing the Yaddo name on it. A few scenes of the movie are set at Yaddo&#x27;s location as well.

Mentioned in the Showtime series &quot;The Affair&quot; season 2, episode 11 where Noah Solloway&#x27;s agent offers to set him up at Yaddo to write his second novel.

<text>Dio Chrysostom (; &quot;Dion Chrysostomos&quot;), Dio of Prusa or Cocceianus Dio (c. 40 – c. 115 AD), was a Greek orator, writer, philosopher and historian of the Roman Empire in the 1st century AD. Eighty of his &quot;Discourses&quot; (or &quot;Orations&quot;; ) are extant, as well as a few letters, a mock essay &quot;Encomium on Hair&quot;, and a few other fragments. His sobriquet &quot;Chrysostom&quot; comes from the Greek , which literally means &quot;golden-mouthed&quot;.

==Life==
He was born at Prusa (now Bursa), in the Roman province of Bithynia (now part of northwestern Turkey). His father, Pasicrates, seems to have bestowed great care on his son Dio&#x27;s education. At first he lived in Prusa, where he held important offices, composed speeches and other rhetorical and sophistical essays, and studied philosophy. The Stoic and Platonist philosophies, however, appear to have had the greatest charms for him, particularly the stoicism of Musonius Rufus.

He went to Rome during Vespasian&#x27;s reign (69–79 AD), by which time he seems to have got married and had a child. He became a critic of the Emperor Domitian, who banished him from Rome, Italy, and Bithynia in 82 for advising one of the Emperor&#x27;s conspiring relatives. He claims that, on the advice of the Delphic oracle, he put on the clothes of a beggar, and with nothing in his pocket but a copy of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; and Demosthenes&#x27;s &quot;On the False Embassy&quot;, he lived the life of a Cynic philosopher, undertaking a journey to the countries in the north and east of the Roman empire. He thus visited Thrace, Mysia, Scythia, and the country of the Getae, giving orations.

He was a friend of Nerva, and when Domitian was murdered in 96 AD, Dio used his influence with the army stationed on the frontier in favour of Nerva. Under Emperor Nerva&#x27;s reign, his exile was ended, and he was able to return home to Prusa. He adopted the surname Cocceianus, reflecting Nerva&#x27;s &quot;nomen&quot;, Cocceius. Dio addressed his four &quot;Orations on Kingship&quot; to Nerva&#x27;s successor, Trajan, and appears to have known the Emperor personally, claiming &quot;I am perhaps as well acquainted with your character as anyone.&quot; He knew Apollonius of Tyana and Euphrates of Tyre. In his later life Dio had considerable status in Prusa, and Pliny the Younger reports that he was involved in a lawsuit about a civic building project around 111. He probably died a few years later.

==Writings==
Dio Chrysostom was part of the Second Sophistic school of Greek philosophers which reached its peak in the early 2nd century during the Antonine period. He was considered one of the most eminent of the Greek rhetoricians and sophists by the ancients who wrote about him, such as Philostratus, Synesius, and Photius. This is confirmed by the eighty orations of his which are still extant, and which were the only ones known in the time of Photius. These orations appear to be written versions of his oral teaching, and are like essays on political, moral, and philosophical subjects. They include four orations on Kingship addressed to Trajan on the virtues of a sovereign; four on the character of Diogenes of Sinope, on the troubles to which men expose themselves by deserting the path of Nature, and on the difficulties which a sovereign has to encounter; essays on slavery and freedom; on the means of attaining eminence as an orator; political discourses addressed to various towns which he sometimes praises and sometimes blames, but always with moderation and wisdom; on subjects of ethics and practical philosophy, which he treats in a popular and attractive manner; and lastly, orations on mythical subjects and show-speeches. He argued strongly against permitting prostitution. Two orations of his (37 and 64) are now assigned to Favorinus. Besides the eighty orations we have fragments of fifteen others, and there are extant also five letters under Dio&#x27;s name.

He wrote many other philosophical and historical works, none of which survives. One of these works, Getica, was on the Getae, which the Suda incorrectly attributes to Dio Cassius.

<doc id="270359" wikidata="Q945042" url="?curid=270359" title="Oscar Levant">
<text>Oscar Levant (December 27, 1906August 14, 1972) was an American concert pianist, composer, conductor, author, radio game show panelist, television talk show host, comedian, and actor. He had roles in the films &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945), &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949), &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), and &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953). He was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 for recordings featuring his piano performances. He was portrayed by Sean Hayes in the Broadway play &quot;Good Night, Oscar&quot;, written by Doug Wright.
Levant appeared as himself in the Gershwin biopic &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945).

==Early life==
Levant was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, in 1906, to Orthodox Jewish Max, a watchmaker, and Annie, who emigrated from Russia. Levant&#x27;s parents were married by his maternal grandfather, who was a rabbi.

Levant moved to New York in 1922. He began studying under Zygmunt Stojowski. In 1925, Levant appeared with Ben Bernie in a short sound film, &quot;Ben Bernie and All the Lads&quot;, made in New York City with the De Forest Phonofilm sound-on-film system. In the 1920s, Levant recorded with the Ben Bernie Orchestra.

==Career==

Levant traveled to Hollywood in 1928, where his career took a turn for the better. During his stay, he met and became friends with George Gershwin. From 1929 to 1948, Levant composed the music for more than twenty movies. During this period, he also wrote or co-wrote numerous popular songs that made the hit parade, the most noteworthy being &quot;Blame It on My Youth&quot; (1934), now considered a standard.
Levant began composing seriously around 1932. He studied under Arnold Schoenberg and impressed Schoenberg sufficiently to be offered an assistantship (which he turned down, considering himself unqualified). These formal studies led to a request by Aaron Copland to play at the Yaddo Festival of contemporary American music on April 30 of that year. Successful, Levant began composing a new orchestral work, a sinfonietta.

Levant made his debut as a music conductor in 1938 on Broadway, filling in for his brother Harry in sixty-five performances of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s &quot;The Fabulous Invalid&quot;. In 1939, he was again working on Broadway as composer and conductor of &quot;The American Way&quot;, another Kaufman and Hart production. He was a talented pianist and was well known for his recorded works of Gershwin, and numerous classical composers. During a time in the 1940s, he was the highest paid concert pianist in the United States.

Also, at this time, Levant was becoming known to American audiences as one of the regular panelists on the radio quiz show &quot;Information Please&quot;. Originally scheduled as a guest panelist, Levant proved so quick-witted and popular that he became a regular fixture on the show in the late-1930s and 1940s, along with fellow panelists Franklin P. Adams and John Kieran and moderator Clifton Fadiman. &quot;Mr. Levant,&quot; as he was always called, was often challenged with musical questions, and he impressed audiences with his depth of knowledge and facility with a joke. Kieran praised Levant as having a &quot;positive genius for making offhand cutting remarks that couldn&#x27;t have been sharper if he&#x27;d honed them a week in his mind. Oscar was always good for a bright response edged with acid.&quot; Examples include &quot;I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin,&quot; &quot;I think a lot of [conductor/composer Leonard] Bernstein—but not as much as he does,&quot; and (after Marilyn converted to Judaism when she married playwright Arthur Miller), &quot;Now that Marilyn Monroe is kosher, Arthur Miller can eat her.” 
Levant appeared in feature films, starting from the 1920s until the mid-50s, often playing a pianist or composer. He had supporting roles in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musicals &quot;The Barkleys of Broadway&quot; (1949), starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), starring Gene Kelly; and &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), starring Astaire and Cyd Charisse. Oscar Levant regularly appeared on NBC radio&#x27;s &quot;Kraft Music Hall&quot;, starring singer Al Jolson. He not only accompanied Jolson on the piano with classical and popular songs, but often joked and ad-libbed with Jolson and his guests. This included comedy sketches. Their individual ties to George Gershwin—Jolson introduced Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Swanee&quot;—undoubtedly had much to do with their rapport. Both Levant and Jolson appeared as themselves in the Gershwin biopic &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945).

In the early 1950s, Levant was an occasional panelist on the NBC radio and television game show &quot;Who Said That?&quot;. Levant hosted a talk show on KCOP-TV in Los Angeles from 1958 -1960, &quot;The Oscar Levant Show&quot;, which was later syndicated. It featured his piano playing along with monologues and interviews with guests such as Fred Astaire and Linus Pauling. Full recordings of only two shows are known to have survived, one with Astaire, who paid to have a kinescope recording of the broadcast made so that he could assess his performance.

==Personal life ==
Levant married actress Barbara Woodell in 1932. The couple divorced in 1933. In 1939, Levant married singer and actress June Gale; they had three daughters, Marcia, Lorna, and Amanda.

Levant talked publicly about his neuroses and hypochondria. Levant became addicted to prescription drugs and was committed to psychiatric hospitals by his wife.

==Death==

In August 1972, Levant died of a heart attack at his Beverly Hills, California, home at the age of 65. Levant&#x27;s body was discovered by his wife, June, when she called to him for an interview with Candice Bergen, who was then working as a photojournalist. Bergen had shot photos of Levant on a previous visit, one of which was published in her memoir, &quot;Knock Wood&quot;.

Levant is interred in the Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
Actor John Garfield used Levant as a model when creating the character of troubled genius Mickey Borden in the 1938 film &quot;Four Daughters&quot;. Levant was the inspiration for the neurotic, womanizing pianist Henry Orient in Nora Johnson&#x27;s novel &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964).

In April 2023, a play about Levant&#x27;s life written by Pulitzer Prize winner Doug Wright premiered on Broadway. The play, &quot;Good Night, Oscar,&quot; premiered at the Belasco Theatre and starred Sean Hayes, who received a Tony Award for &quot;Best Actor in a Play&quot; for his performance. &quot;Good Night, Oscar&quot; was a fictionalized version of a true event in Levant&#x27;s life, when he was given a four-hour furlough from a psychiatric hospital to allow him to appear on a TV game show (in the play it&#x27;s portrayed as&quot;The Tonight Show.&quot;)

<doc id="270381" wikidata="Q152357" url="?curid=270381" title="Red hair">
<text>Red hair, also known as ginger hair, is a human hair color found in 2–6% of people of Northern or Northwestern European ancestry and lesser frequency in other populations. It is most common in individuals homozygous for a recessive allele on chromosome 16 that produces an altered version of the MC1R protein.

Red hair varies in hue from a deep burgundy or bright copper, or auburn, to burnt orange or red-orange to strawberry blond. Characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin, it is typically associated with fair skin color, lighter eye color, freckles, and sensitivity to ultraviolet light.

Cultural reactions to red hair have been varied. The term &quot;redhead&quot; has been in use since at least 1510, while the term &quot;ginger&quot; is sometimes used, especially in Britain and Ireland, to describe a person with red hair.

The origin of red hair can be traced to Central Asia, caused by a mutation in the MC1R gene.

==Geographic distribution==
===Modern===
====Northern and Northwestern Europe====
Red hair is most commonly found at the northern and western fringes of Europe; it is centred around populations in the British Isles and is particularly associated with the Celtic nations.

Ireland has the highest number of red-haired people per capita in the world, with the percentage of those with red hair at around 10%.

Great Britain also has a high percentage of people with red hair. In Scotland, around 6% of the population has red hair, with the highest concentration of red head carriers in the world found in Edinburgh, making it the red head capital of the world. In 1907, the largest ever study of hair colour in Scotland, which analysed over 500,000 people, found the percentage of Scots with red hair to be 5.3%. A 1956 study of hair colour among British Army recruits also found high levels of red hair in Wales and in the Scottish border counties of England.

====Eastern Europe====
Byzantine writers Jordanes and Procopius described the early Slavic peoples as having ruddy hair and skin tone. Later by the 10th century, Southern Slavic populations would have darker hair and skin tone, as the Slavs assimilated the indigenous inhabitants of the Balkans, including Greek and Illyrian peoples.

In the late 18th century, ethnographers considered the Udmurt people of the Volga Region in Russia to be &quot;the most red-headed men in the world&quot;. The Volga region still has one of the highest percentages of red-headed people.

Red hair is also found amongst the Ashkenazi Jewish populations. In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards. The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia.

====Southern Europe====
In Italy, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.57% of the total population, without variation in frequency across the different regions of the country. In Sardinia, red hair is found at a frequency of 0.24% of the population. In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. In European culture, before the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition, all those with red hair were identified as Jewish.

====North Africa and Mediterranean====
The Berber populations of Morocco and northern Algeria have occasional redheads. Red hair frequency is especially significant among the Riffians from Morocco and Kabyles from Algeria, respectively.

====Asia (all regions)====

In Asia, red hair can be found among some peoples of Afghan, Arab, Iranian, East Indians, Mongolian, Turkic, Miao, and Hmong descent.

Several preserved samples of human hair have been obtained from an Iron Age cemetery in Khakassia, South Siberia. Many of the hair samples appear red in color, and one skull from the cemetery had a preserved red moustache.
Ancient human remains described as having red or auburn hair have been discovered in various parts of Asia, including the Tarim mummies of Xinjiang, China. In Chinese sources, ancient Kyrgyz people were described as fair-skinned, green- or blue-eyed and red-haired people with a mixture of European and East Asian features. In the Book of Wei, Chinese author Wei Shou notes that Liu Yuan was over tall and had red strands of hair in his long beard. The ethnic Miao people of China are recorded with red hair. According to F.M Savina of the Paris Foreign Missionary Society, the appearance of the Miao was &quot;pale yellow in complexion, almost white, their hair is often light or dark brown, sometimes even red or corn-silk blond, and a few even have pale blue eyes&quot;. A phenotype study of Hmong people show they are sometimes born with red hair.

The Kipchak people were a Turkic ethnic group from Central Asia who served in the Golden Horde military forces after being conquered by the Mongols. In the Chinese historical document &quot;Kang mu&quot;, the Kipchak people are described as red haired and blue-eyed.

====Americas, Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa====

Reddish-brown (auburn) hair is also found among some Polynesians, and is especially common in some tribes and family groups. In Polynesian culture, reddish hair has traditionally been seen as a sign of descent from high-ranking ancestors and a mark of rulership. Emigration from Europe has increased the population of red haired humans in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

===Historical===
Several accounts by Greek writers mention redheaded people. A fragment by the poet Xenophanes describes the Thracians as blue-eyed and red-haired. The ancient Budini and Sarmatians are also reported by some classical Greek authors to be blue-eyed and red-haired. It was once believed that Sarmatians owed their name to their red hair, but this claim was later debunked.

In Asia, red or auburn hair has been found among the ancient Tocharians, who occupied the Tarim Basin in what is now the northwesternmost province of China. Tarim mummies have been found with red hair dating to the 2nd millennium BC.

In certain Biblical accounts, Hebrew and Israelite individuals were described as having ruddy hair. For example, Esau and David (Gen. 25:25; 1 Sam. 16:12, 17:42.), are described as &quot;admoni&quot;, meaning red or ruddy.

==Biochemistry and genetics==
The pigment pheomelanin gives red hair its distinctive color. Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.

The genetics of red hair appear to be associated with the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), which is found on chromosome 16. In 1995, Valverde, et al. identified alleles on MC1R associated with red hair. The number of alleles linked to red hair has since been expanded by other authors, and these variants are now identified as the RHC (&quot;red hair colour&quot;) alleles. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant within the RHC. Red hair is also associated with fair skin color because the MC1R mutation also results in low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important vitamin D can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer. The MC1R variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is difficult or impossible to tan. Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun&#x27;s ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, freckles are a common, but not universal, feature of red-haired people.

Red hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes, then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal recessive. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be carriers for the gene and have a redheaded child.

Genetic studies of dizygotic (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not sufficient, for red hair production.

===Genetics===
The alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, Asp294His, and Arg142His on MC1R are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype. The gene &quot;HCL2&quot; on chromosome 4 may also be related to red hair. There are at least 8 genetic differences associated with red hair color.

In species other than primates, red hair has different genetic origins and mechanisms.

===Beards===
The genes responsible for red hair can express themselves to different extents in different people. One consequence of this is that a number of people
 have both dark hair and red beards. This may reflect the presence of a single copy of the MC1R gene, leading to differential expression in the beard versus the scalp hair. However, some red-bearded people lack MC1R genes.

===Evolution===
====Origins====
Red hair is the rarest natural hair color in humans. The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents rickets in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of vitamin D production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin. In 2000, Harding &quot;et al.&quot; concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm pale skin. However, in Northern Europe this does not happen, so redheads can become more common through genetic drift.

Estimates on the original occurrence of the currently active gene for red hair vary from 20,000 to 100,000 years ago.

A DNA study has concluded that some Neanderthals also had red hair, although the mutation responsible for this differs from that which causes red hair in modern humans.

====Extinction hoax====
A 2007 report in &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;, which cited the &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine and unnamed &quot;geneticists&quot;, said that red hair is likely to die out in the near future. Other blogs and news sources ran similar stories that attributed the research to the magazine or the &quot;Oxford Hair Foundation&quot;. However, a HowStuffWorks article says that the foundation was funded by hair-dye maker Procter &amp; Gamble, and that other experts had dismissed the research as either lacking in evidence or simply bogus. The &quot;National Geographic&quot; article in fact states, &quot;while redheads may decline, the potential for red isn&#x27;t going away&quot;.

Red hair is caused by a relatively rare recessive allele, the expression of which can skip generations. It is not likely to disappear at any time in the foreseeable future.

==Medical implications of the red hair gene==
===Melanoma===

Melanin in the skin aids UV tolerance through sun tanning, but fair-skinned persons lack the levels of melanin needed to prevent UV-induced DNA-damage. Studies have shown that red hair alleles in MC1R increase freckling and decrease tanning ability. It has been found that Europeans who are heterozygous for red hair exhibit increased sensitivity to UV radiation.

Red hair and its relationship to UV sensitivity are of interest to many melanoma researchers. Sunshine can both be good and bad for a person&#x27;s health and the different alleles on MC1R represent these adaptations. It also has been shown that individuals with pale skin are highly susceptible to a variety of skin cancers such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma.

===Pain tolerance and injury===

Two studies have demonstrated that people with red hair have different sensitivity to pain to people with other hair colors. One study found that women with red hair are slightly more sensitive to thermal pain (associated with naturally occurring low vitamin K levels) and that lidocaine was significantly less effective in reducing pain. Another study concluded that redheads are less sensitive to pain from multiple modalities, including noxious stimuli such as electrically induced pain.

Researchers have found that people with red hair require greater amounts of anesthetic. Another study showed women with gene variants associated with red hair had a greater analgesic response to the painkiller pentazocine than do either women of other hair colors or men of any hair color. A follow-up study by the same group showed that men and women with red hair had a greater analgesic response to morphine-6-glucuronide. However, a later study of 468 healthy adult patients found no significant difference in recovery times, pain scores, or quality of recovery in those with red hair compared with dark hair in either men or women.

The unexpected relationship of hair color to pain tolerance appears to exist because redheads have a mutation in a hormone receptor that can apparently respond to at least two types of hormones: the pigmentation-driving melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and the pain-relieving endorphins (both derive from the same precursor molecule, POMC, and are structurally similar). Specifically, redheads have a mutated melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene that produces an altered receptor for MSH. Melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment in skin and hair, use the MC1R to recognize and respond to MSH from the anterior pituitary gland. Melanocyte-stimulating hormones normally stimulates melanocytes to make black eumelanin, but if the melanocytes have a mutated receptor, they will make reddish pheomelanin instead. MC1R also occurs in the brain, where it is one of a large set of POMC-related receptors that are apparently involved not only in responding to MSH, but also in responses to endorphins and possibly other POMC-derived hormones. Though the details are not clearly understood, it appears that there is some crosstalk between the POMC hormones that may explain the link between red hair and pain tolerance.

There is little or no evidence to support the belief that people with red hair have a higher chance than people with other hair colors to hemorrhage or suffer other bleeding complications. One study, however, reports a link between red hair and a higher rate of bruising.

==Red hair of pathological origin==
Most red hair is caused by the MC1R gene and is non-pathological. However, in rare cases red hair can be associated with disease or genetic disorders:
* In cases of severe malnutrition, normally dark human hair may turn red or blonde. The condition, part of a syndrome known as kwashiorkor, is a sign of critical starvation caused chiefly by protein deficiency, and is common during periods of famine.
* One variety of albinism (Type 3, a.k.a. albinism), sometimes seen in Africans and inhabitants of New Guinea, results in red hair and red-colored skin.
* Red hair is found on people lacking pro-opiomelanocortin.

There have also been rare reports of scalp or beard hair spontaneously turning partially red, with no identified pathological cause.

==Culture==

In various times and cultures, red hair has been prized, feared, and ridiculed.

=== Media, fashion and art ===
Queen Elizabeth I of England was a redhead, and during the Elizabethan era in England, red hair was fashionable for women. In modern times, red hair is subject to fashion trends; celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Alyson Hannigan, Marcia Cross, Christina Hendricks, Emma Stone and Geri Halliwell can boost sales of red hair dye.

Sometimes, red hair darkens as people get older, becoming a more brownish color or losing some of its vividness. This leads some to associate red hair with youthfulness, a quality that is generally considered desirable. In several countries such as India, Iran, Bangladesh and Pakistan, henna and saffron are used on hair to give it a bright red appearance.

Many painters have exhibited a fascination with red hair. The hair color &quot;Titian&quot; takes its name from the artist Titian, who often painted women with red hair. Early Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; depicts the mythological goddess Venus as a redhead. Other painters notable for their redheads include the Pre-Raphaelites, Edmund Leighton, Modigliani, and Gustav Klimt.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot; (1891) involves a man who is asked to become a member of a mysterious group of red-headed people. The 1943 film &quot;DuBarry Was a Lady&quot; featured red-heads Lucille Ball and Red Skelton in Technicolor.

Notable comic book characters with red hair include Jean Grey, Red Sonja, Mystique, and Poison Ivy.

A book of photographs of red haired people was published in 2020, &quot;Gingers&quot; by Kieran Dodds (2020).

=== Red hair festivals ===
There has been an annual Redhead Day festival in the Netherlands that attracts red-haired participants from around the world. The festival was held in Breda, a city in the south east of the Netherlands, prior to 2019, when it moved to Tilburg. It attracts participants from over 80 countries. The international event began in 2005, when Dutch painter Bart Rouwenhorst decided he wanted to paint 15 redheads.

The Irish Redhead Convention, held in late August in County Cork since 2011, claims to be a global celebration and attracts people from several continents. The celebrations include crowning the ginger King and Queen, competitions for the best red eyebrows and most freckles per square inch, orchestral concerts and carrot throwing competitions.

A smaller red-hair day festival is held since 2013 by the UK&#x27;s Anti-Bullying Alliance in London, with the aim of instilling pride in having red-hair.

Since 2014, a red-hair event is held in Israel, at Kibbutz Gezer (Carrot), for the local Israeli red hair community, including both Ashkenazi and Mizrahi red-heads. However, the number of attendees has to be restricted due to the risk of rocket attacks, leading to anger in the red-hair community. The organizers state; &quot;The event is a good thing for many redheads, who had been embarrassed about being redheads before.&quot;

The first and only festival for red heads in the United States was launched in 2015. Held in Highwood, Illinois, Redhead Days draws participants from across the United States.

A festival to celebrate the red-haired people is held annually in Izhevsk (Russia), the capital of Udmurtia, since 2004.

MC1R Magazine is a publication for red-haired people worldwide, based in Hamburg, Germany.

=== Religious and mythological traditions ===

In ancient Egypt, red hair was associated with the deity Set, as well as Ramesses II.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Achilles&#x27; hair is described as (), usually translated as blonde, or golden but sometimes as red or tawny. His son Neoptolemus also bears the name Pyrrhus, a possible reference to his own red hair.

The Norse god Thor is usually described as having red hair.

The Hebrew word usually translated &quot;ruddy&quot; or &quot;reddish-brown&quot; (&quot;admoni&quot; , from the root &quot;ADM&quot; , see also Adam and Edom) was used to describe both Esau and David.

Early artistic representations of Mary Magdalene usually depict her as having long flowing red hair, although a description of her hair color was never mentioned in the Bible, and it is possible the color is an effect caused by pigment degradation in the ancient paint.

Judas Iscariot is also represented with red hair in Spanish culture and in the works of William Shakespeare, reinforcing the negative stereotype.

=== The name &quot;Rory&quot; ===

The mainly masculine given name &quot;Rory&quot; – a name of Goidelic origin, which is an anglicisation of the /Ruaidhrí/Ruaidhrígh/Raidhrígh, and Manx: Rauree which is common to the Irish, Highland Scots and their diasporas – means &quot;red-haired king&quot;, from &quot;ruadh&quot; (&quot;red-haired&quot; or &quot;rusty&quot;) and &quot;rígh&quot; (&quot;king&quot;). However, present bearers of the name are by no means all red-haired themselves.

== Prejudice and discrimination against redheads ==
===Beliefs concerning temperament===
A common belief about redheads is that they have fiery tempers and sharp tongues. In &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, a character says of Anne Shirley, the redheaded heroine, that &quot;her temper matches her hair&quot;, while in &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, Holden Caulfield remarks that &quot;People with red hair are supposed to get mad very easily, but Allie [his dead brother] never did, and he had very red hair.&quot;

During the early stages of modern medicine, red hair was thought to be a sign of a temperament. In the Indian medicinal practice of Ayurveda, redheads are seen as most likely to have a Pitta temperament.

Another belief is that redheads are highly sexed; for example, Jonathan Swift satirizes redhead stereotypes in part four of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, &quot;A Voyage to the Country of the Houyhnhnms,&quot; when he writes that: &quot;It is observed that the red-haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity.&quot; Swift goes on to write that &quot;neither was the hair of this brute [a Yahoo] of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular) but black as a sloe&quot;. Such beliefs were given a veneer of scientific credibility in the 19th century by Cesare Lombroso and Guglielmo Ferrero. They concluded that red hair was associated with crimes of lust, and claimed that 48% of &quot;criminal women&quot; were redheads.

==== Medieval beliefs ====
Theophilus Presbyter describes how the blood of a red-haired young man is necessary to create gold from copper, in a mixture with the ashes of a basilisk.

According to Montague Summers, red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch, werewolf or vampire during the Middle Ages:

==== Medieval antisemitism ====

During the Spanish Inquisition, people of red hair were identified as Jewish and isolated for persecution. In medieval Italy and Spain, red hair was associated with the heretical nature of Jews and their rejection of Jesus, and thus Judas Iscariot was commonly depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. Writers from Shakespeare to Dickens would identify Jewish characters by giving them red hair, such as the villainous Jewish characters Shylock and Fagin. The antisemitic association persisted into modern times in Soviet Russia. The medieval prejudice against red-hair may have derived from the ancient biblical tradition, in relation to biblical figures such as Esau and King David. The ancient historian Josephus would mistranslate the Hebrew Torah to describe the more positive figure of King David as &#x27;golden haired&#x27;, in contrast to the negative figure of Esau, even though the original Hebrew Torah implies that both King David and Esau had &#x27;fiery red hair&#x27;.

==== Modern-day discrimination ====

In his 1885 book &quot;I Say No&quot;, Wilkie Collins wrote &quot;The prejudice against habitual silence, among the lower order of the people, is almost as inveterate as the prejudice against red hair.&quot;

In his 1895 memoir and history &quot;The Gurneys of Earlham&quot;, Augustus John Cuthbert Hare described an incident of harassment:
&quot;The second son, John, was born in 1750. As a boy he had bright red hair, and it is amusingly recorded that one day in the streets of Norwich a number of boys followed him, pointing to his red locks and saying, &quot;Look at that boy; he&#x27;s got a bonfire on the top of his head,&quot; and that John Gurney was so disgusted that he went to a barber&#x27;s, had his head shaved, and went home in a wig. He grew up, however, a remarkably attractive-looking young man.&quot;

In British English, the word &quot;ginger&quot; is sometimes used to describe red-headed people (at times in an insulting manner), with terms such as &quot;gingerphobia&quot; and &quot;gingerism&quot; used by the British media. It is roughly the color of dried, powdered ginger root. In Britain, redheads are also sometimes referred to disparagingly as &quot;carrot tops&quot; and &quot;carrot heads&quot; (the comedian &quot;Carrot Top&quot; uses this stage name). &quot;Gingerism&quot; has been compared to racism, although this is widely disputed, and bodies such as the UK Commission for Racial Equality do not monitor cases of discrimination and hate crimes against redheads.

Nonetheless, individuals and families in Britain are targeted for harassment and violence because of their hair colour. In 2003, a 20-year-old was stabbed in the back for &quot;being ginger&quot;. In 2007, a UK woman won an award from a tribunal after being sexually harassed and receiving abuse because of her red hair; in the same year, a family in Newcastle upon Tyne, was forced to move twice after being targeted for abuse and hate crimes on account of their red hair. In May 2009, a schoolboy committed suicide after being bullied for having red hair. In 2013, a fourteen-year-old boy in Lincoln had his right arm broken and his head stamped on by three men who attacked him &quot;just because he had red hair&quot;; the three men were subsequently jailed for a combined total of ten years and one month for the attack. 
This prejudice has been satirised on a number of TV shows. English comedian Catherine Tate (herself a redhead) appeared as a red-haired character in a running sketch of her series &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;. The sketch saw fictional character Sandra Kemp, who was forced to seek solace in a refuge for ginger people because she had been ostracised from society. The British comedy &quot;Bo&#x27; Selecta!&quot; (starring redhead Leigh Francis) featured a spoof documentary which involved a caricature of Mick Hucknall presenting a show in which celebrities (played by themselves) dyed their hair red for a day and went about daily life being insulted by people; Hucknall, who says that he has repeatedly faced prejudice or been described as ugly on account of his hair colour, argues that Gingerism should be described as a form of racism. Comedian Tim Minchin, himself a redhead, also covered the topic in his song &quot;Prejudice&quot;.

The pejorative use of the word &quot;ginger&quot; and related discrimination was used to illustrate a point about racism and prejudice in the &quot;Ginger Kids&quot;, &quot;Le Petit Tourette&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Jersey Thing&quot; and &quot;Fatbeard&quot; episodes of &quot;South Park&quot;.

Film and television programmes often portray school bullies as having red hair. However, children with red hair are often themselves targeted by bullies; &quot;Somebody with ginger hair will stand out from the crowd,&quot; says anti-bullying expert Louise Burfitt-Dons.

In Australian slang, redheads are often nicknamed &quot;Blue&quot; or &quot;Bluey&quot;. More recently, they have been referred to as &quot;rangas&quot; (a word derived from the red-haired ape, the orangutan), sometimes with derogatory connotations. The word &quot;rufus&quot; (a variant of rufous, a reddish-brown color) has been used in both Australian and British slang to refer to red-headed people.

In November 2008, social networking website Facebook received criticism after a &quot;Kick a Ginger&quot; group, which aimed to establish a &quot;National Kick a Ginger Day&quot; on 20 November, acquired almost 5,000 members. A 14-year-old boy from Vancouver who ran the Facebook group was subjected to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for possible hate crimes.

In December 2009 British supermarket chain Tesco withdrew a Christmas card which had the image of a child with red hair sitting on the lap of Father Christmas, and the words: &quot;Santa loves all kids. Even ginger ones&quot; after customers complained the card was offensive.

In October 2010, Harriet Harman, the former Equality Minister in the British government under Labour, faced accusations of prejudice after she described the red-haired Treasury secretary Danny Alexander as a &quot;ginger rodent&quot;. Alexander responded to the insult by stating that he was &quot;proud to be ginger&quot;. Harman was subsequently forced to apologise for the comment, after facing criticism for prejudice against a minority group.

In September 2011, Cryos International, one of the world&#x27;s largest sperm banks, announced that it would no longer accept donations from red-haired men due to low demand from women seeking artificial insemination.

==== Use of term in Singapore and Malaysia ====
The term &quot;ang mo&quot; () in Hokkien (Min Nan) Chinese, meaning &quot;red-haired&quot;, is used in Malaysia and Singapore, although it refers to all white people, never exclusively people with red hair. The epithet is sometimes rendered as &quot;ang mo kui&quot; () meaning &quot;red-haired devil&quot;, similar to the Cantonese term &quot;gweilo&quot; (&quot;foreign devil&quot;). Thus it is viewed as racist and derogatory by some people. Others, however, maintain it is acceptable. Despite this ambiguity, it is a widely used term. It appears, for instance, in Singaporean newspapers such as &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, and in television programmes and films.

The Chinese characters for &quot;ang mo&quot; are the same as those in the historical Japanese term &quot;Kōmō&quot; (), which was used during the Edo period (1603–1868) as an epithet for Dutch or Northern European people. It primarily referred to Dutch traders who were the only Europeans allowed to trade with Japan during &quot;Sakoku&quot;, its 200-year period of isolation.

The historic fortress Fort Santo Domingo in Tamsui, Taiwan was nicknamed in Taiwanese Hokkien .

<text>The Anti-Comintern Pact, officially the Agreement against the Communist International was an anti-communist pact concluded between Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan on 25 November 1936 and was directed against the Communist International (Comintern). It was signed by German ambassador-at-large Joachim von Ribbentrop and Japanese ambassador to Germany Kintomo Mushanokōji. Italy joined in 1937 (earlier it had signed the Italo-Soviet Pact directed partly against Hitler), but it was legally recognized as an original signatory by the terms of its entry. Spain and Hungary joined in 1939. Other countries joined during World War II.

The Japanese signatories had hoped that the Anti-Comintern Pact would effectively be an alliance against the Soviet Union, which was how the Soviets perceived it. There was also a secret additional protocol which specified a joint German-Japanese policy specifically aimed against the Soviet Union.

After August 1939, Japan distanced itself from Germany as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The Anti-Comintern Pact was followed by the September 1940 Tripartite Pact, which identified the United States as the primary threat rather than the Soviet Union (although in theory applying to the Soviets as well), however by December 1941 this too was virtually inoperative. The Anti-Comintern Pact was subsequently renewed in November 1941 and saw the entry of several new members into the pact. The Nazi regime saw signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact as a &quot;litmus test of loyalty&quot;.

The Anti-Comintern Pact ceased to exist with the end of World War II.

The &quot;Anti-Komintern&quot;, officially the &quot;Gesamtverband Deutscher antikommunistischer Vereinigungen&quot; (abbr. GDAV, &#x27;general association of German anti-communist federations&#x27;), was a German agency established by Joseph Goebbels in 1933. Its activities covered a wide range of operations designed to denounce communism in general and the Soviet Union in particular, push antisemitic propaganda and garner domestic and international support for Nazi policy. It was placed under the leadership Dr. Adolf Ehrt de]. Under Ehrt&#x27;s leadership, the Comintern was denounced as &#x27;godless&#x27; in reference to its atheism. Beginning in July 1936, the Spanish Civil War became a main focus for the Anti-Komintern&#x27;s publications.

One of the Anti-Komintern&#x27;s most significant outputs was the 1936 international release &quot;Der Weltbolschewismus&quot;, in which it connected various anti-communist and anti-semitic conspiracy theories for the consumption of the international audience. The book was not released in Germany itself to avoid conflict between the book&#x27;s varied accounts with German state propaganda.

==== Anglo-German Naval Agreement ====
On 18 June 1935, the United Kingdom and Germany signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, which came as a surprise to the Japanese. This marked the beginning of a series of attempts by Adolf Hitler to improve relations between the two countries. In Hitler&#x27;s mind, a positive relationship towards the United Kingdom would weaken Britain&#x27;s allies France and Italy (at that point still a German rival) and contain the Soviet Union. Hitler would later also send Ribbentrop to London with the specific task of securing British membership in the Anti-Comintern Pact during his 1936–1938 tenure as German ambassador to the United Kingdom, declaring British accession into the pact as his &#x27;greatest wish&#x27;.

In Japan, the treaty was viewed with suspicion. Mushanokōji on 4 July 1935 in an embassy meeting stated his opinion that it would be unwise for Japan to rush into an alliance with Germany, as he (correctly) interpreted the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as a German attempt to ally the UK. The United States and Britain had been hostile towards Japan ever since the Mukden Incident of 1931, and Mushanokōji feared that Japan might isolate itself if Germany ended up choosing a partnership with Britain over a partnership with Japan.

==== Competing authorities and ideologies in German foreign policy ====

The execution of German foreign policy was nominally left to Konstantin von Neurath&#x27;s foreign ministry, but Joachim von Ribbentrop headed the semi-autonomous &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, created in late 1934, where he could carry out Hitler&#x27;s personal foreign policy requests independently from foreign ministry consent. This created a rivalry between the two services. While Hitler favored Ribbentrop as his personal foreign policy champion, he at least initially maintained Neurath&#x27;s staff of career diplomats to maximize his government&#x27;s diplomatic legitimacy abroad. Hiroshi Ōshima, Japanese military attaché in Berlin and the single most important individual on the Japanese side of the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s negotiations, interpreted the German foreign service structure as one where the power structure was such that &quot;it was only Hitler and Ribbentrop who decided foreign policy, and that it was therefore of no use to talk to their subordinates&quot;. Ōshima thus attempted to get any important step of the negotiations to Ribbentrop&#x27;s or Hitler&#x27;s desks directly.

While Ribbentrop was Hitler&#x27;s personal diplomat of choice, his personal view on geostrategic diplomacy varied quite distinctly from Hitler&#x27;s during the late 1930s. Whereas Hitler favored a friendly policy towards Britain to eliminate the Soviet Union, Ribbentrop saw the western allies as Germany&#x27;s main enemy and designed much of German foreign policy, including the Anti-Comintern Pact, with the goal to contain the British Empire in mind as well. When it came to Japan, Ribbentrop believed that the Japanese focus on the Soviet Union as its main antagonist could be redirected towards the United Kingdom also, thus enabling Japan to be a partner in Ribbentrop&#x27;s anti-British coalition.

German alignment with Japan, against the wishes of the traditionally sinophile German foreign service and German public at large, began at the end of 1933.

==== German-Soviet interwar treaties ====
During the time of the Weimar Republic, the German government had made major treaties with the USSR, including the 1922 Treaty of Rapallo and the 1926 Treaty of Berlin.

Germany was already agitating against the Soviet Union in 1935 when after a previous German–Polish declaration of non-aggression, through Hermann Goring proposed a military alliance with Poland against the Soviet Union, but this was rejected. Germany made later approaches to Poland nevertheless.

In a note on the day of the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, 25 November 1936, Ribbentrop informed Mushanokōji that the German government viewed these two treaties&#x27; terms as void under the secret additional protocol. Mushanokōji replied on the same day, expressing the Japanese government&#x27;s &quot;sincere satisfaction&quot; with the German stance. This had been partially a result of the Japanese government&#x27;s insistence, most notably in a request on 24 July 1936, to clarify the treaty&#x27;s implications for past bilateral treaties between either party and the Soviet Union.

==== Racial Equality Proposal of 1919, Washington Naval Conference of 1922 ====
Japan had fought in the Great War on the side of the victorious Entente Powers. However, as part of the Washington Naval Conference of 1922, the United States and United Kingdom successfully managed to both limit Japan&#x27;s naval forces by treaty and to force Japan to surrender her gains in China made during World War I. While there were some advantages for Tokyo gained during the conference – it was granted parity with USA and UK in the Pacific Ocean and was entitled to build a navy that would outmatch the French and Italian navies, as well as being recognized as the world&#x27;s only non-western colonial power – the treaty was unpopular in Japan. Japanese nationalists, as well as the Imperial Japanese Navy, denounced the treaty&#x27;s restrictive aspects.

Culturally, the 1922 Washington Treaty was viewed as yet another betrayal by the Western powers, after the Japanese proposals for guaranteed racial equality under the League of Nations had been rejected in 1919. This perception of national humiliation was further accelerated by the economic downturn that Japan experienced in the 1920s, exemplified by the 1927 financial panic in Japan (Shōwa financial crisis), which had also caused political instability and the fall of the first cabinet of Reijirō Wakatsuki, and by the 1929 Great Depression. German historian Bernd Martin dubbed the Washington Naval Conference the &quot;Japanese &#x27;Versailles&#x27;.&quot;

==== Japanese societal militarization and aggression against China ====
The Mukden Incident of 18 September 1931 began the period of Japanese aggression in Asia between 1931 and 1945, sometimes called the &quot;Fifteen Years War&quot;.

The diplomatic reaction of the European great powers to Japan&#x27;s attack against China was insufficient to stop the Japanese advance, despite continued Chinese appeals to the League of Nations. This attack, which had no central order from Tokyo precede it and was rather an autonomous decision by the Kwantung Army leadership, was kept confined to North East China by the Japanese commanders in the hopes that this would be enough to keep European responses lukewarm and thus further Japanese advances. This estimation proved to be accurate, and the United Kingdom in particular was more than happy to let Japan proceed in Manchuria as long as British interests in southern and central China remained undisturbed. Even after the Shanghai Incident of 28 January 1932, the British attitude remained on the whole friendly to the Japanese cause and indifferent towards Chinese pleas for assistance. Among the few exceptions to this were British efforts to bring about peace in the city of Shanghai itself, where the UK had direct economic interests.

The Japanese Pacification of Manchukuo on the other hand was viewed in Britain as a positive development that ultimately would help to disperse bandit activity. In February 1932, the Japanese established a puppet state in North East China, the Empire of Manchukuo, nominally headed by Puyi, the dethroned last emperor of the Qing dynasty (r. 1908–1912, 1917).

Following the Lytton Report, which laid the blame for the conflict in Manchuria firmly at the feet of the Japanese, Sir John Simon, the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom, failed to condemn Japan in his speech on 7 December 1932, and subsequently earned the favor of Japanese politicians such as Yōsuke Matsuoka, who viewed the lackluster British response as further encouragement for the Japanese course in China. Japan left the League of Nations as a result of the Lytton Report in February 1933.

The Tanggu Truce ended the hostilities in Manchuria, but Japanese ambition in China was not yet satisfied. Between 1933 and 1936, Japanese foreign minister Kōki Hirota pursued the , the &#x27;friendly diplomacy of Hirota&#x27;. Summed up by the Amau Doctrine of 1934, Japan viewed itself as the protective power of all of East Asia, mirroring the role of the United States in the Americas under the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. This posturing was again permitted by the European great powers, and Neville Chamberlain even attempted to negotiate an Anglo-Japanese non-aggression pact to improve British relations with Japan in 1934. In secret, Hirota&#x27;s foreign policy leadership set an array of highly ambitious goals for Japan&#x27;s diplomacy. This included an industrial buildup in Manchukuo, the acquisition of resources from North China via subjugation, conquest of the western Pacific and South East Asia, and preparations for a war against the Soviet Union.The Japanese army in October 1934 published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Essence of National Defense and Proposals to Strengthen It&quot;, going directly against the attempt of diplomatic reconciliation that was at the same time (at least half-heartedly) attempted by the civilian government in Tokyo (named &quot;Shidehara diplomacy&quot; after former Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara). The pamphlet demanded a complete subjugation of all aspects of foreign and domestic policy to the all-encompassing question of &quot;national defense&quot; and the nation&#x27;s preparation for total war. It further denounced &quot;cooperative diplomacy&quot;, lauded the Japanese decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, and called upon Japan to accept its fate and to formulate a great plan for the next 100 years.

The military subsequently continued its practice of publishing pamphlets with overt political content without prior coordination with the civilian government. In November 1936, about the time of the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s conclusion, the army pamphlet &quot;Perfecting the Army&#x27;s Preparedness and the Spirit Required&quot; advocated strengthening the army and openly called for the reform of the civilian government and the reform of the Japanese state to better suit the military&#x27;s goals.

==== Domestic power struggles about Japanese foreign policy ====
The Japanese imperial state&#x27;s system was dubbed &quot;a cone without vertex&quot; by Japanese historian Ken Ishida. The Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) and the Japanese foreign ministry each had its own agenda with regards as to how Japan should orient its foreign policy. The Japanese system, highly traditional and based around the spiritual and socio-cultural value of Emperor Hirohito, also involved the imperial court, which served as a buffer between these three rival groups and the Emperor at the top, which allowed Hirohito to escape direct political responsibilities for any failures and setbacks that the system might produce.

==== Japanese–Soviet fishery treaty negotiations and border disputes ====
At the time of the negotiations for the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Japanese government was also in negotiations with the Soviet government over fishing rights in the Sea of Japan. As the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s secret additional protocol between Germany and Japan against the USSR was to forbid political treaties by either state with the Soviet Union without the express consent of the other party to the Anti-Comintern Pact, Japanese ambassador Mushanokōji was concerned whether the Pact would result in consequences for the Japanese-Soviet negotiations. He inquired about it in a letter to Ribbentrop after the signing of the treaty on 25 November, and also mentioned the issue of border questions between Japanese-controlled Manchukuo and the USSR. Ribbentrop confirmed the German government&#x27;s assent that Japan was autonomous and free to proceed in the matters mentioned by Mushanokōji his reply on the same day.

=== Ideological similarities and contradictions between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan ===

The Anti-Comintern Pact was more of a statement than an actual political commitment, and the statement was one of mutual ideological alignment and diplomatic attachment to one another. Both countries shared examples of very politically significant racial ideologies, with Alfred Rosenberg in Germany and Shūmei Ōkawa in Japan becoming the leading racialist ideologues. Whereas Rosenberg enjoyed government backing and was a central party figure after the Nazis&#x27; rise to power in 1933, Ōkawa&#x27;s audience was more limited. Ōkawa found his main support base with young nationalistic military officers, particularly those in the Kwantung Army, the military unit that instigated Japan&#x27;s initial invasion of North East China in 1931. Ōkawa&#x27;s work was in late 1936 furthered by Takeo Nimiya&#x27;s influential foreign policy pamphlet &quot;The Unique Principles Guiding Japanese Diplomacy&quot;, in which Takeo laid out a vision of a long-term orientation of Japanese diplomacy around a racially justified expansionist policy based on traditional Japanese spiritual values rather than western-style imperialism. Nimiya&#x27;s pamphlet was especially popular with young bureaucrats and students who were about to enter Japanese state politics in the late 1930s and early 1940s.The two countries shared a common ideological antagonist in the communism, which was extensively covered in the German and Japanese media and perceived as a real threat of subversion among German and Japanese political elites. As a result of Japanese reservations about an outright military alliance, the Anti-Comintern Pact was conceptualized as an anti-communist agreement rather than an outright military alliance. However, the Japanese military establishment was concerned about the growth of Soviet military strength, and Japanese military attachés in Europe had held conferences about the potential threat coming specifically from the USSR as early as 1929 to discuss potential countermeasures. The Japanese government on 8 August 1936 issued an internal document that specifically justified the German-Japanese alliance as a response to the growing threat that the Soviet Union posed in Asia and the close parallels between Japanese and German interests regarding the USSR. This document also revealed intentions to include other European, Islamic and Asian countries in the anti-Soviet pact and specifically named Poland as a potential candidate for pact membership.

Both the Japanese and German movements shared an aversion towards the League of Nations, and both countries left the League during the year 1933. The two countries shared a similar list of diplomatic adversaries: The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

While the German and Japanese racial ideologies of the supposed superiority of the Aryan race and the Yamato race, respectively, showed parallels, these parallels should logically have made the alliance less likely, as the two countries&#x27; fascisms viewed each other as racially inferior. In fact, Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; specifically names the Japanese as an example of a racial grouping on the second out of three cultural tiers, a step down from the Aryan race on the top. To prevent diplomatic complications as a result of German racial thought, German racist propaganda in the state-controlled press was directed away from the topic of the Japanese people so as to not irritate Japan.

=== Seventh World Congress of the Comintern ===
At the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern in July 1935, following the advice of Georgi Dimitrov to the Soviet government that had resulted from Dimitrov&#x27;s experiences in France and Austria during 1934, the Communist International drastically changed the course that communist parties were advised to take in democratic systems. Instead of viewing the democratic and fascist parties as politically allied (&quot;social fascism&quot;), the communist movements were encouraged to ally with leftist and centrist forces (the policy of the &quot;popular front&quot;) in order to prevent the rightists from gaining ground.

Diplomatically, the Seventh World Congress also brought on the &#x27;collective security&#x27; policy in the Soviet Union, wherein the USSR would attempt to align with the western democracies to counteract the fascist regimes. The Seventh World Congress specifically declared fascist Germany and Japan, next to Poland, to be among the world&#x27;s chief instigators of war.

This declaration accelerated Ribbentrop&#x27;s efforts to secure a German-Japanese alliance against the USSR, or at least a promise of non-support for the Soviet Union in case of a war between one of the countries against it. This change in Comintern policy also made it urgent for the European fascists to prevent the strengthening of leftist popular fronts against them.

=== Role of China in German-Japanese relations ===
The Republic of China was an important partner to the Germans, but a bitter enemy of the Japanese Empire, as Japan had invaded Manchuria in 1931. Although Ribbentrop hoped to involve both China and Japan in his anti-communist bloc, the continued hostilities and eventual outbreak of war made the ambivalent German position, including the Sino-German military cooperation and the status of Alexander von Falkenhausen and other military advisors to Chiang Kai-shek, a serious concern to both of the Asian states. Furthermore, China was the biggest trade partner for German businesses in Asia. China was also favored by the German military establishment and the armament industry, as the Chinese military was an important customer for German arms manufacturers and heavy industry. Chinese exports to Germany, including deliveries of tin and tungsten, were also seen as vital.

During his time as Japanese ambassador to Germany, Mushanokōji made it one of his goals to undermine German-Chinese economic and diplomatic relations. Within Germany&#x27;s foreign service, Ribbentrop favored cooperation with Japan, whereas Neurath preferred alignment with China.

One of the major questions in the German foreign service in regards to Germany&#x27;s diplomatic ambivalence between China and Japan was the recognition of the Japanese puppet state in Manchukuo, installed after the 1931 Japanese invasion of North East China. A recognition of Manchukuo, as suggested by German ambassador in Tokyo Herbert von Dirksen beginning in early 1934, would have clearly presented a German statement in favor of Japanese expansionism and would have disturbed Germany&#x27;s Chinese partners. As a result of the possible irritation of the Chinese government and the potential misgivings of the Soviet government about the potential perception of an attempted encirclement by a German-Japanese entente, such a recognition of Manchukuo was initially opposed by Neurath and the foreign ministry. In response to his initial request to recognize Manchukuo, Dirksen was instructed to avoid &quot;any close relations with Japan which might lay [Germany] open to being suspected of wishing to render assistance against Russia&quot;. This German caution towards any offense cast against the Soviet Union resulted from the impression in Berlin that Japan during the year 1934 was under serious threat of diplomatic and military encirclement. Specifically, Dirksen was also instructed to pay close attention to any signs of a potential war between Japan and the USSR, which the Germans assumed the Soviet Union would probably receive the aid of the western democracies if it were to break out, although this potential war was not perceived as immediately imminent. Regardless, the German foreign service sought at all costs to avoid entanglement in such a conflict.

For their part, the Japanese political and military establishments were by 1934 also less than certain about the usefulness of the new Hitler government in Germany, which Tokyo assumed would attempt to maintain a peaceful relationship with the Soviet Union and avoid any open alignment with Moscow&#x27;s enemies. The distrust that Japan felt was partially caused by the close relationship between Germany and China, which in turn was perceived as an ally of the Soviet Union against Japan.

After the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s signing, Falkenhausen was recalled to Germany against his will after Japanese pressure in 1938. China eventually declared war on Germany and Italy, along with Japan, on 9 December 1941, in the aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American entry into World War II, citing German and Italian support for Japanese aggression as the reason.

=== Instability in France ===
The domestic situation in the French Third Republic was unstable. This provided the opportunity for France&#x27;s rivals, especially Germany, to expand their influence, while at the same time weakening France&#x27;s European partners, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia.

The cabinet of Léon Blum, supported by France&#x27;s popular front, had taken the reins in June 1936. The social instability and political violence within France made the French government careful and ineffective in applying France&#x27;s otherwise extensive diplomatic and military power. Hitler, who expected France&#x27;s popular front to result in a situation similar to the Spanish Civil War, openly announced to the French ambassador on 6 October 1936 that a communist takeover in France would not be treated by Germany as a domestic affair.

In French foreign policy, the 1934 German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact had caused concerns about the stability of the French alliance system in eastern Europe, leading to a French realignment towards the Soviet Union that resulted in the 1936 Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance.

=== German, Italian and Soviet involvement in the Spanish Civil War ===
The Spanish Civil War, in which Germany supported the Nationalists and the Soviet Union the Republicans, reinforced the urgency in the mind of the German leadership to create some sort of anti-Soviet military arrangement to counteract a potential aggression by the Soviet Union. The Spanish nationalists also received aid from Mussolini&#x27;s Italy (Corpo Truppe Volontarie), but the Italian attitude to a potential anti-communist or anti-Soviet agreement was initially the opposite of the German position: the Italians viewed the signing of an anti-communist treaty as superfluous, as Italy&#x27;s anti-communist commitment was in the Italian viewpoint sufficiently proven in their support for the Spanish nationalists.

The Spanish Civil War was viewed by the Germans as concrete proof that the teachings of the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, which had been specifically aimed against Germany (and Japan), were indeed affecting geopolitics.

== Creation ==

=== Early designs by &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot; and Hiroshi Ōshima ===

After the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the Seventh World Congress, the German &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot; envisioned in October 1935 an anti-communist diplomatic system that might involve both the Empire of Japan and the Republic of China. This idea had support on the Japanese side by Hiroshi Ōshima, then the military attaché for Japan in Berlin, although Ōshima was more concerned with a Japanese subjugation of China rather than with an equal Japanese-Chinese alliance against the Soviet Union. The Nationalist government in China was unwilling to make deals with Japan as long as the Japanese occupation of Manchuria persisted, so Ōshima and Ribbentrop drafted a bilateral treaty between Germany and Japan.

Originally, the treaty was scheduled for November 1935, and invitations were to be extended to China, the United Kingdom, Italy and Poland. However, the German military and diplomatic leadership stalled the treaty&#x27;s realization, as they feared a breakdown in the German relations with China. Furthermore, foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath was jealous of Ribbentrop&#x27;s exalted position in foreign policy outside of the ministry&#x27;s control.

While the initial designs for the pact came from &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, Hiroshi Ōshima, who would himself become Japan&#x27;s ambassador to Germany in 1938–1939 and 1941–1945, became very influential in the pact&#x27;s outline on the Japanese side. While the government in Tokyo was not particularly proactive in the pact&#x27;s creation, Ōshima and the staff of the Japanese embassy in Berlin were. When Mushanokōji stated his suspicions of the German intentions to the embassy personnel on 4 July 1935, Ōshima was the main source of disagreement within the staff.

Regardless, Mushanokōji ended up making the recommendation to the Japanese government to only pursue an alliance with German insofar as it did not lead to the deterioration of Japanese relations with the United Kingdom and United States. Ōshima was a staunch anti-communist and veteran of the Japanese intervention in Siberia, and used his good connections within Germany, among others to Wilhelm Canaris of the &quot;Abwehr,&quot; to, without authorization from ambassador Mushanokōji, further his pro-German and anti-Soviet agenda within the embassy. Initially disgusted with the military and political weakness of the Weimar Republic when he first arrived in Germany in 1922, he became an admirer of Adolf Hitler following the National Socialists&#x27; rise to power in 1933, and concluded that &quot;there were things in the new Germany which were worthy of serious consideration&quot;. Ōshima was aided by the fact he spoke the German language with a high degree of fluency.

His positive predispositions towards the NSDAP government made him useful in the anti-Soviet designs of the Imperial Japanese Army, which aimed to envelop the Soviet Union through an alliance with Germany, eventually planning to strike into Siberia to secure its natural resources for Japan (Hokushin-ron). Ōshima&#x27;s instructions from the high command were to investigate the German government&#x27;s stability, the future of the German military, and the state of German-Soviet military and diplomatic relations.

Ōshima followed his assignment diligently, and the high frequency of his visits to and inspections of the German military establishment was noted even by the American military attaché Hugh W. Rowan, one of whose tasks was to observe Japanese covert activity in Berlin. Rowan was soon convinced that Ōshima was &quot;being given access to important technical information in possession of the German army&quot;. The threat posed by the Soviet Union remained Ōshima&#x27;s principal concern, and he aggressively sought out all German information on Soviet military strength he could attain. His aforementioned relationship with Canaris of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; was also largely based on the prospect of a potential German-Japanese intelligence service cooperation against the Soviet Union. By 1937, he would also forge close contacts with Wilhelm Keitel, the later Chief of OKW.One of Ōshima&#x27;s old associates from the time of the Weimar Republic, Friedrich Wilhelm Hack de], had by 1934 joined the new &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop.&quot; Hack served as the networker between Ōshima, Canaris and German minister of defense Werner von Blomberg, organizing meetings in Freiburg, starting in early 1935. Hack was instrumental in establishing personal contacts for Ōshima and was the most important link between Ōshima and Joachim von Ribbentrop, whom Ōshima viewed as the single most important person on the German side after Hitler himself. Ōshima first met with Ribbentrop in March 1935. Ribbentrop reported to Hitler, according to his (Ribbentrop&#x27;s) testimony at Nuremberg, that he &#x27;personally had certain connections with Japanese persons&#x27;. Historian Carl Boyd interprets this as a reference to the contact with Ōshima established via Hack. With Hitler&#x27;s tentative approval (Hitler was uncertain of Ōshima&#x27;s authority and wanted Ribbentrop to ascertain the opinions of the higher-ups in the Japanese military establishment), negotiations between Ōshima and Ribbentrop went into full swing in fall of 1935.

=== Negotiations ===

==== 1935 ====

Starting with the meetings in October, which at some point involved Hitler himself, Ōshima presented his idea of a promise of mutual assistance in case of an attack on one of the two countries by the Soviet Union. At this point, Ōshima&#x27;s telegrams to the Japanese army were enthusiastic about the diplomatic potential of the negotiations, up to and including the possibility of an open German-Japanese military alliance, even though both sides were more immediately comfortable at that point with a less impactful agreement to not aid the Soviet Union in case of a Soviet war against the other party. Such a &#x27;no aid&#x27;-agreement was easier to fit into each country&#x27;s respective grand strategies. Ōshima&#x27;s extensive involvement was essential to the formation of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but was also the source of some discomfort among the Japanese military and diplomatic leaderships, as Ōshima had far overextended his military assignment with his unauthorized diplomatic cooperation with Ribbentrop and even Hitler himself. But instead of the severe punishment that a junior officer like Ōshima might have otherwise received for his reckless dealings with a foreign head of government, Ōshima&#x27;s advance was acknowledged positively by the Japanese hyper-militarists, who were sympathetic to Hitler&#x27;s policies and impressed by Ōshima&#x27;s successes.

In late October 1935, the chief of the Japanese army&#x27;s general staff, Prince Kan&#x27;in Kotohito, signalled that the army was positively disposed towards a pact with Germany. Kotohito had been a close associate of Hiroshi Ōshima&#x27;s father Ken&#x27;ichi Ōshima, Japan&#x27;s Minister of the Army in 1916–1918, and was thus positively predisposed towards Hiroshi Ōshima&#x27;s activity in Europe, and likely one of Ōshima&#x27;s protectors in the question of Ōshima overstepping his initial assignments.

Kotohito assigned a general staff intelligence officer, Tadaichi Wakamatsu, with a mission in Berlin that involved ascertaining the German attitude towards a German-Japanese agreement directed against the Soviet Union. Meetings between Wakamatsu, Ōshima and Blomberg in November and December 1935 achieved little, although Wakamatsu signalled the general willingness of the Japanese army to negotiate a treaty with Germany. He was sceptical of the &quot;Dienststelle&#x27;s&quot; semi-official status within the German foreign service.

However, the IJA in principle remained open to the idea, and Wakamatsu left Germany for Japan in December 1935 with the understanding that both sides would seek government approval for the pact. Wakamatsu and Kotohito were overall unprepared to deal with the remarkable progress that Ōshima reported in his messages and the potential magnitude of the resulting German-Japanese treaty.

Near the end of 1935, Soviet Red Army intelligence intercepted several secret telegrams between Ōshima and the Japanese General Staff. This information was forwarded to the Soviet embassy in Japan, from which the American embassy also heard news of the ongoing secret negotiations between Germany and Japan. This marked the first time that the Soviet Union is confirmed to have received word of the ongoing negotiations of the Anti-Comintern Pact.

==== 1936 ====
The inconsistencies between the German foreign ministry and &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot; showed themselves again in the course of the negotiations. Dirksen, ambassador in Tokyo, was informed about the ongoing talks not by the German foreign service, but instead by the Japanese General Staff. German foreign minister Konstantin von Neurath, when informed about the situation by Hitler, argued against the creation of a German-Japanese pact. Firstly, he was concerned with Sino-German relations and thought Japan less important to Germany than China, and secondly, he wanted to avoid having foreign policy authority slip away from the foreign ministry towards &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, where he saw Ribbentrop as a rival to his own position. In Japan, the matter was stalled, as the important documents got lost between January and February 1936 in the bureaucratic apparatus of the Japanese foreign ministry, as they were discarded by low-ranking officials before reaching foreign minister Kōki Hirota or his deputy Mamoru Shigemitsu.

Only in March 1936, following the turmoil in Japan related to the failed military coup of February 26 and the German Remilitarization of the Rhineland did the matter reach the new foreign minister Hachirō Arita, who discussed it with the ambassador to Germany Mushanokōji, who was in Japan at that time, and several high-ranking army officials. In that meeting, Chief of Military Affairs Ryoki Machijiri was the only one in favor of an outright military alliance between Germany and Japan, whereas Arita, Shigemitsu, Hisaichi Terauchi and Mushanokōji favored the more careful way of an agreement specifically aimed against the Comintern. However, they overestimated their own authority in Berlin, where Ōshima was still the main negotiation partner for the Germans and personally unwilling to give up any of his newfound diplomatic importance to officials of the foreign ministry. To prevent a clash with the Japanese army, of which Ōshima as a military attaché was technically the subordinate of, rather than the foreign ministry, Arita and Mushanokōji had to carefully weave a new position. While favoring the Anti-Comintern version of the agreement, they still gave Ōshima as a representative of the military the ability to negotiate a full alliance. Mushanokōji was instructed to take a passive stance towards the Germans and let them initiate negotiations, as to not appear as if the Japanese foreign ministry was making a leap forward.

On the German side, the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 27 March 1936 increased the demand for a strong partner in the Soviet Union&#x27;s rear to prevent complete encirclement. Furthermore, Hitler hoped that France&#x27;s allegiance to the Soviet Union might drive the anti-communist British government into a deal with Germany if Germany only made a strong enough gesture against communism. As such, negotiations resumed on 23 October 1936 and the pact was finalized and signed on 25 November of the same year. The treaty between France and the USSR, as well as the increased cooperation between communists and socialists that had resulted from the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, allowed the communist PCF to double its votes in the 1936 elections in France. With infighting on the political left in Europe reduced, it became more urgent for the German government to reassess its position. On the same day that Ribbentrop and Mushanokōji initialed a draft agreement (23 October), Neurath signed a secret nine-point protocol with his Italian counterpart, Galeazzo Ciano.

However, the German diplomatic ambivalence between the ideological proximity and military potential of Japan and the economic value of China continued, and Neurath remained in favor of German alignment with China. In April 1936, Germany signed a major commercial treaty with China and gave them a credit of 100,000,000 marks for China to purchase German industrial and other products. It was Hitler himself who, unbeknownst to Neurath and the foreign ministry, began to reassess the importance of China and Japan in German foreign relations over the course of the summer of 1936. Hitler sanctioned new negotiations with the Japanese.

Later that year, when German military attaché in Tokyo Eugen Ott temporarily returned to Germany to attend army maneuvers, he expressed his optimism about the Japanese army&#x27;s willingness to conclude the pact to Hitler.

Terauchi in May 1936 informed Ōshima that the army was yielding control of the negotiations to the foreign ministry in order to restore harmony between the two factions, but unofficially, Ōshima would remain Japan&#x27;s key negotiator and Mushanokōji&#x27;s role would be more ceremonial. In July, Mushanokōji requested a draft of the proposed treaty from &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, which was drawn up by one of the &quot;Dienststelle&quot;&#x27;s East Asian specialists, Dr. Hermann von Raumer. But instead of taking this draft immediately to Mushanokōji, Raumer, who probably acted on Ribbentrop&#x27;s instructions, first presented it to Ōshima, who was attending the Bayreuth Festival at the time. On 22 July, Ōshima, Ribbentrop, Raumer and Hitler met in Bayreuth, where Hitler made some personal edits to Raumer&#x27;s draft. Only then was the draft shown to ambassador Mushanokōji.

=== Japanese objections and final adjustments ===
This initial draft signed off on by Hitler appears to be lost to history, as the Japanese ambassador made some changes to it that were intended, according to Shigenori Tōgō&#x27;s testimony at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, to make it less &#x27;propagandistic&#x27; and more &#x27;business-like&#x27;. Tōgō, acting on behalf of Arita, who was once again Japanese foreign minister, wanted to scrap all of Hitler&#x27;s envisioned military provisions. Because Hitler&#x27;s draft was lost, it is impossible to say what these were, but from the context, it seems likely that they were both a defensive as well as an offensive alliance against the Soviet Union, because Tōgō, when he was unable to have all military provisions scrapped outright, instead took the position that any such provisions should be purely defensive, implying that they were offensive as well at some point. On 24 July 1936, the Japanese government after some deliberation formally requested that the Anti-Comintern Pact should be limited only to an intelligence and information exchange as to avoid unnecessary diplomatic complications with the Soviet Union. The Japanese government also specifically requested to avoid any direct alliance and to instead only require consultation in case of attack, even in the secret protocol. Furthermore, the Japanese government requested clarification to make any obligation in case of a war of one of the parties against the Soviet Union specifically defensive (to avoid being drawn into a German offensive war against the USSR at an inopportune time), and to avoid specifically naming the Soviet Union in the treaty, even in the secret protocol. The first two requests made their way into the final version of the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the third did not. The Soviet Union&#x27;s name was only avoided in the public parts of the treaty, and the secret protocol of the finalized Anti-Comintern Pact still specifically referred to the USSR.

Additionally, the Japanese government also requested clarification on the prohibition on bilateral treaties with the Soviet Union without former consent, fearing that the wording of the treaty would allow Germany to maintain existing bilateral treaties with the USSR, including the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) and the Treaty of Berlin (1926). Specifically the latter treaty, which was a German-Soviet neutrality pact that had been upheld even by the anti-communist Nazis, was viewed in Japan as contradictory to the proposed terms of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The German government viewed the Anti-Comintern Pact as sufficient to override the terms of the Treaty of Berlin, and the Japanese government was satisfied with this explanation as long as it was attached to the treaty as a secret appendix.

The Japanese government in its internal memoranda also stressed the vital necessity to avoid a deterioration of Anglo-Japanese relations as a result of the pact. There was a hope in Japan that the Anti-Comintern Pact could appeal to anti-communist circles in the United Kingdom and mend the two countries&#x27; relationship. After the pact&#x27;s conclusion, this would prove to be a miscalculation.

Ōshima, in a final act of insubordination to the foreign ministry, suggested to Hitler that the foreign ministry&#x27;s objections could be salvaged if the anti-Soviet clauses of the treaty were added to the agreement in secret. Eventually, the foreign ministry yielded to the army&#x27;s pressure, and agreed to a secret military addendum to the pact. On 16 August 1936, Ribbentrop informed Hitler that negotiations with ambassador Mushanokōji and with Ōshima had resulted in the ambassador&#x27;s declaration that the Japanese government was willing in principle to approve the agreement. In a note to Hitler, Ribbentrop commented on the Japanese government&#x27;s aversion to and the Japanese army&#x27;s support for publication of the treaty

However, some minor adjustments were still made between August and October, when the pact was formally initialed. Its length was reduced to 5 years, down from 10 as had originally been planned. And, against Ōshima&#x27;s and Hitler&#x27;s hopes, the military leadership in Japan insisted that the military provisions could be only defensive and not offensive, even if agreed upon in a secret addendum. The military leadership was concerned that, if Japan was caught in a war against China, an offensive clause to the treaty would diplomatically force Japan into a war against the Soviet Union that it was militarily unwilling to fight. As a result, the first article of the secret additional protocol spoke specifically of &quot;unprovoked attack&quot; by the Soviet Union and had no offensive provisions.

On the other hand, the Japanese side was unable to gain the upper hand on the topic of the pact&#x27;s publication, which was advocated for by the Germans and which Japan had attempted to avoid. Furthermore, the secret protocol remained explicitly aimed at the Soviet Union, something that the Japanese had felt was an ineffective provision.

The treaty draft was finalized on 23 October 1936.

=== Approval by the Japanese Privy Council and by Adolf Hitler ===
The Anti-Comintern Pact required the approval of the Privy Council of Japan to allow Japanese accession to the treaty. Prime Minister Hirota had expressed his personal relief upon hearing the treaty draft&#x27;s conclusion on 23 October 1936, and compared the achievement of the IJA in its advancement of the Anti-Comintern Pact to the IJN&#x27;s success in forging the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. The elder Japanese statesman Saionji Kinmochi, last of the genrō, had disagreed with the Japanese government&#x27;s diplomatic step and denounced the Anti-Comintern Pact as exclusively useful to Germany and as without benefit for Japan. Kinmochi instead would have preferred a diplomatic course more in line with Japanese public opinion and geography, both of which made a positive relationship with UK and USA desirable. However, Kinmochi&#x27;s critical stance remained unheard in the Privy Council.

In the view of the proponents of the treaty within Japan, spearheaded by the IJA, Japan was militarily threatened by the Soviet Union&#x27;s meddling in China, just as Germany was threatened by Soviet support for France and Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, both countries feared subversion by communist forces. This, as a result, made Germany and Japan natural allies against the Soviet Union and the Comintern. The opponents, who gathered around the IJN, cited the likelihood that the Anti-Comintern Pact would increase rather than decrease the threat posed by the USSR and that there would be considerable domestic resistance against the agreement. Ultimately, the supporters won out in the discussions that took place on 13 November and 18 November, and the Privy Council gave the treaty its unanimous support on 25 November 1936.

On the German side, all that was required for German accession to the pact was Hitler&#x27;s approval, which was given quickly, and subsequently supported by a wave of anti-communist propaganda in the state-controlled German press.

== Signing ==
The treaty, which outlined a joint German and Japanese policy to counteract the activities of the Communist Internationale, was initially to be in force for five years, until November 1941. Two additional protocols were signed, one of which was public. The other, which was specifically aimed against the Soviet Union, was secret. The treaty was signed in the offices of &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot; rather than the German foreign ministry. Ribbentrop, in his Nuremberg testimony, attributed this to Hitler&#x27;s desire to avoid the usage of official channels of German politics for what Ribbentrop referred to as an &quot;ideological question&quot; rather than a political one.

=== Texts of the Anti-Comintern Pact and its protocols ===

==== Main agreement ====
The full text was considered in its original form in both the German and Japanese versions, and the date was specified in both countries&#x27; versions as 25 November 1936 as well as 25 November in the 11th year of the Shōwa period. The agreement bears the signatures of German ambassador-at-large Ribbentrop and Japanese ambassador to Germany Mushanokōji. The initial length of the treaty was specified to be five years. This reduced length was one of the concessions made after the objections of the Japanese foreign ministry to the initial Bayreuth draft of the treaty, in which the treaty was at first supposed to have a duration of ten years.
In the first article of the treaty, Germany and Japan agreed to share information about Comintern activities and to plan their operations against such activities jointly. In the second article, the two parties opened the possibility of extending the pact to other countries &quot;whose domestic peace is endangered by the disruptive activities of the Communist Internationale&quot;. Such invitations to third parties would be undertaken jointly and after the expressed consent by both parties. German state media referred to this provision of endangerment by Comintern disruption when, among other examples, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; recounted various communist activities in Hungary and Manchukuo as the reason for the two countries to join the pact in February 1939.

==== Protocol supplement ====
A supplementary protocol was signed along with the agreement on the same day, 25 November 1936/Shōwa 11. Just like the main agreement, it bears the signatures of Ribbentrop and Mushanokōji.

In the first article, German and Japan agreed to have their competent authorities &quot;closely co-operate in the exchange of reports on the activities of [...] and on measures of information and defense against&quot; the Comintern. The two contracting parties also agreed, in the second article, to have their competent authorities &quot;within the framework of the existing law [...] take stringent measures against those who at home or abroad work on direct or indirect duty&quot; of the Comintern.

==== Secret additional protocol ====
In addition to the main treaty and the public additional protocol (&quot;Protocol Supplement&quot;), there was also another additional protocol on 25 November 1936/Shōwa 11, this one kept in strict secrecy from the public, which specifically dealt with the establishment of Germany&#x27;s and Japan&#x27;s military and diplomatic partnership against the Soviet Union. While the Soviet Union was alluded to with the public protocol&#x27;s references to Comintern activity, the secret additional protocol is the only one where the USSR is actually mentioned by name. Just like the main agreement and the public additional protocol, the secret additional protocol was signed by Ribbentrop and Mushanokōji.

The latter protocol&#x27;s secrecy was agreed upon in a separate document signed by both Ribbentrop and Mushanokōji, in which the two states created the option to inform third parties about the contents of the secret agreement with mutual consent. Ambassador Mushanokōji informed Japanese foreign minister Hachirō Arita of the successful conclusion of negotiations later on in the day.

The secret additional protocol reveals the true intention of the Anti-Comintern Pact. Rather than a vague ideological crackdown on the alleged overreach of communist activists, it was a specific defensive alliance direct particularly against the Soviet Union as a country.

Due to its covert nature, the secret additional protocol remained exclusive between Germany and Japan, whereas other countries joined only the two public clauses of the treaty. Starting with Italy, the other countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact did not sign the secret additional protocol.

=== Reactions ===
To the international community, the Anti-Comintern Pact signalled the beginning of the German-Japanese partnership, as it marked the first formal alliance between the two countries.

==== China ====
The Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan was a direct threat to China, which relied on German military assistance against the threat of the imminent Japanese invasion. The German foreign ministry, which had been opposed to &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&#x27;s&quot; alignment with Japan, made significant efforts to reassure China of German assistance. This lasted until the outbreak of hostilities between Japan and China in July 1937, after which Germany, keeping with Ribbentrop&#x27;s agenda, aligned clearly with Japan, including the German compliance with Japanese requests to recall the military mission of Alexander von Falkenhausen.

==== France ====
In France, the Anti-Comintern Pact, especially after Italy&#x27;s entry, was viewed as a German power grab in Eastern Europe, particularly to the detriment of Czechoslovakia and Poland.

==== Germany ====
The German public was informed of the treaty&#x27;s entry into legislation by the German &quot;Reichsgesetzblatt&quot; in 1937. Ribbentrop justified the Anti-Comintern Pact as a joint German-Japanese act to defend western civilization. The existence of the secret additional protocol and the treaty&#x27;s anti-Soviet nature was denied in Nazi Germany even after the beginning of the German-Soviet War in 1941.

The German government launched a pro-Japanese publicity campaign to improve the general opinion of the German public about Japan. This was part of the German government&#x27;s attempt to forge a tighter cultural relationship.

==== Italy ====
The Italian government, which had still viewed Germany as a potential rival well into the year 1935, had initially abstained from the negotiations of the Anti-Comintern Pact. But starting with the 1936 October Protocols, Germany and Italy had begun a diplomatic rapprochement against the backdrop of the Italian war in Ethiopia and the resulting failure of the Italian Stresa Front with the UK and France. Still, Italy was keen to, at least initially, avoid the implication that it would soon adhere to the Anti-Comintern Pact itself, even though Ribbentrop heavily implied that &quot;Italy will hoist the anti-Bolshevist banner in the south&quot; soon after the pact&#x27;s creation. Hitler shared that same impression. Italy would end up joining the pact in November 1937.

==== Japan ====

The Japanese public as a whole did not receive the Anti-Comintern Pact with any particular enthusiasm. In the aftermath of the agreement, the influx of national socialist ideology into Japanese society after the alignment with Germany caused an increase in antisemitism in Japan. The Japanese press, less restricted than its German counterpart, was even partially critical of the pact&#x27;s apparently sudden and rushed conclusion (the negotiations had been kept in strict secrecy from the public until the pact&#x27;s publication), and there were doubts in the newspapers&#x27; opinion pieces about the willingness of Germany to sacrifice its soldiers in the case of a war between Japan and the Soviet Union.

In Tokyo, the government was reluctant to attract any unwanted international antagonists, while it remained focussed on its aims in mainland China. As such, the government had been initially cautious, reluctant to cause a diplomatic incident with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, but eventually saw itself driven into the treaty when the Soviet Union signed a Mutual Assistance Pact with the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic in March 1936. However, despite the government&#x27;s scepticism, the Privy Council had given its unanimous consent.

As a result of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the military influence within the government was strengthened. The Japanese government, in response to the upsurge of antisemitism that resulted from the influx of European-style national socialist ideology into Japanese society, began using antisemitic imagery in its media campaigns, particularly those directed against western-style capitalism. Prime Minister Hirota called Germany Japan&#x27;s foremost diplomatic partner after the treaty, but stressed that the Anti-Comintern Pact did not imply ideological support for Germany&#x27;s domestic policy.

The IJA, which traditionally was an admirer and imitator of German military systems, which employed hundreds of German military experts and advisors by the 1920s, and sent Japanese army hopefuls to Germany for study, was the treaty&#x27;s main proponent. Prince Kotohito had signalled the army&#x27;s positive predisposition towards Ōshima&#x27;s efforts in Berlin. The IJA was closely aligned with its German counterpart and a strong proponent of a joint Japanese-German action against the Soviet Union.

The IJN, by contrast, was among the treaty&#x27;s greatest critics. While the IJN officer class was not necessarily denouncing the pact, its usefulness was seen as very limited. The IJN view of the naval situation was one where Japan had an inferior naval force to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, both of whom were furthermore inclined to cooperate with each other to counteract the Japanese presence if necessary. By contrast, Germany (and later Italy) would be of almost no help to alleviate an Anglo-American naval blockade or aid the Japanese naval efforts in the Pacific. The Japanese navy would have preferred to avoid the treaty if that meant a better relationship with the United States and the United Kingdom as a result.

==== Soviet Union ====
Publicly, the Soviet government attempted to downplay the significance of the pact. However the Anti-Comintern Pact was seen internally as a clear sign of an attempted encirclement by Germany and Japan. In a political note to the Hungarian government in January 1939, Soviet foreign minister Maxim Litvinov called the Anti-Comintern Pact a &quot;political instrument mainly in the hands of the Japanese, who had hostile intentions against the Soviet Union&quot;. Litvinov had also, in speaking to the All-Union Congress of Soviets on 26 November, cast doubt on the completeness of the treaty as presented to the public, declaring it to be &quot;only a camouflage for another agreement which was simultaneously discussed&quot;.

Soviet diplomats quickly came to the same opinion that had been implied by Litvinov on 26 November: the Anti-Comintern Pact was specifically directed against the USSR. Soviet ambassador in Tokyo Konstantin Yurenev believed (correctly) that the pact, behind its facade, contained military provisions against the Soviet Union. Yurenev had even contacted Japanese foreign minister Arita before the pact&#x27;s publication, on 16 November and 20 November. While Arita had on the first request dodged the issue by pointing to the fact that the negotiations were only concerned with the Comintern and not the Soviet Union, he did not respond to the latter contact by Yurenev, in which the ambassador accused the Japanese foreign service of holding secret negotiations with Germany specifically aimed against the USSR.

The Anti-Comintern Pact politically accelerated the downward trend of the Soviet Union&#x27;s trade relations with Japan. Alarmed by the Anti-Comintern Pact, the USSR had cut down sales to and purchases from Japan: in 1939, Japanese imports from European Russia were the lowest since 1914 and exports to European Russia the lowest since 1926, whereas Japanese imports from Asiatic Russia were the lowest since 1887 and exports to Asiatic Russia the lowest since 1914. The Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s restrictive policy towards bilateral treaties between Japan and the USSR without German consent made this downward spiral hard to fix. Only after the German-Soviet Pact of 1939 and the subsequent decrease of Japanese trust in Germany did the mutual political and economic attitude improve.

==== United Kingdom ====
The United Kingdom also saw its colonial empire in Asia and eventually Africa threatened by the Japanese and later also the Italian alliance with Germany. This view was not completely unjustified in the context of the Axis Powers&#x27; navies, as the naval high commands of Germany, Italy and Japan mainly aimed their common considerations against the United Kingdom, not the Soviet Union. In the House of Commons, the Anti-Comintern Pact became a subject of debate multiple times. The British armed forces were concerned about a potential military conflict with Germany and Japan, and this feeling was escalated upon Italian accession to the agreement.

==== United States ====
In the United States, the German-Japanese agreement was viewed as an indication that Germany might follow Japan&#x27;s path of satisfying territorial claims with military action, as Japan had done in Manchuria in 1931. In a September 1937 report to the Treasury (after the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War), it was argued that the long-term consequence of a Japanese victory in China would result in other &quot;dissatisfied&quot; powers, such as Germany and Italy, seeking the fulfillment of their objectives in military endeavors of their own. The American armed forces were concerned about the prospect of Japan gaining military allies in the form of Germany and later Italy, as that posed a potential threat to the American War Plan Orange.

In 1937, American ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew analyzed the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s anti-communist rhetoric as a mere banner for &quot;have-not&quot; countries to unite under while in truth aiming primarily against the British Empire&#x27;s global dominance.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, U.S. president from 1933 to 1945, shared French concerns about the safety of Poland and Czechoslovakia. Roosevelt believed that the pact contained secret clauses outlining an alliance that was both defensive and offensive, and that it divided the world into spheres of influence for each of the signatories. Eventually, the USS Panay incident of 1937 resulted in the President&#x27;s attempt to break the Anti-Comintern Pact by appeasing Germany and Italy with the goal of isolating Japan from its allies to hinder its progress in China.

Cordell Hull noted in his memoirs that &quot;[n]othing could have been more logical and natural than an alliance of Berlin and Tokyo&quot;, citing shared values of militarism, conquest and disregard for international treaties as the reason for his conclusion.

== Expansion and adaptations ==
The Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s original provisions had included a specific provision that allowed Germany and Japan to jointly invite additional members into the pact. In Japan, the Anti-Comintern Pact was seen as possibly groundbreaking in freeing the country from its international isolation and to acquire new diplomatic and military partners. Countries whose membership Japan was interested in included the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and especially Poland.

=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===

The Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan met its first trial when Japan and China, both of whom were important partners with Germany, went to war. The Second Sino-Japanese War, provoked by the Japanese forces through the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, forced Germany to reassess the balance of its economic relationship with China and its ideological and military alignment with Japan. It was evident that Germany would have to abandon one of its partners in favor of the other, and made the decision to favor Japan over China, although Hitler himself had as late as 1936 personally still assured the Chinese ambassador that Germany would maintain the two countries&#x27; important relationship.

While Germany&#x27;s policy in regards to the war between Japan and China was one of strict neutrality, it made no particular effort, diplomatic or otherwise, to stop the Japanese aggression against China. The German government and foreign service still remained privately critical of the Japanese course of action. When Japanese ambassador to Germany Mushanokōji explained to state secretary Ernst von Weizsäcker that the Japanese invasion of China kept in the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact in its attempt to vanquish Chinese communism, Weizsäcker dismissed Mushanokōji&#x27;s explanation on the basis of the German view that the Japanese action would foster rather than stifle the growth of communism in China. Weizsäcker, in his notes with regards to this conversation with Mushanokōji, expressed the fear that the Japanese aggression could lead directly to an alliance between the Soviet Union and China.

=== Entry of Italy ===
On 6 November 1937, Italy joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Italy&#x27;s decision was a reaction to the failure of the Stresa Front, the Franco-British initiative of 1935 designed to keep Germany from extending beyond its present borders. In particular, both nations tried to block &quot;German expansionism&quot;, especially the annexation of Austria, which the fascist government in Rome also wanted to prevent at that time.

Distrustful relations and Benito Mussolini&#x27;s own expansionism furthered the distance between Italy and the two Allied Powers. Italy invaded Ethiopia in October 1935, in an act of unprovoked aggression that was a breach of the League of Nations policy. Although the attempted Hoare–Laval Pact, designed by its British and French drafters to allow Italy to retain most of its war goals and to maintain the Stresa Front, had failed to gain support, the League of Nations had discredited itself. After the League eventually punished Italian expansionism with economic sanctions, this broke the Stresa Front and resulted in the necessity for Italy to search for a new partner. As a result, Italy was diplomatically driven away from the Stresa Front with the Allies and towards the Pact of Steel with Germany. Italy&#x27;s accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact completed the diplomatic triangle between Germany, Italy and Japan later formalized in the Tripartite Pact that was colloquially known as the &quot;Axis Powers,&quot; inspired by the term used by Benito Mussolini in reference to the German-Italian relationship on 1 November 1936.

Italy&#x27;s accession into the pact was a trade-off, in which Mussolini agreed to Hitler&#x27;s goals of Austrian annexation. Italy had been invited to the pact as early as the original German-Japanese agreement in November 1936, but was at the time uninterested in the largely symbolic gesture, as the Italian government believed that its anti-communist attitude was sufficiently represented by the Italian presence in the Spanish Civil War. Italian membership had been considered by Ribbentrop during the earliest drafting stages of the agreement in October 1935. German-Italian rapprochement did not fully begin until October 1936, when the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany and Japan was already nearing its enactment.

Galeazzo Ciano, Italy&#x27;s foreign minister, was apprehensive about the potential loss of influence for Italy in South East Europe that a close alignment with Germany and the subsequent German entry into the Balkans would entail. The Italian stance towards a &quot;Third Europe&quot; or &quot;Horizontal Axis&quot;, the idea of a power bloc in Eastern Europe that rejected both German and Soviet influence, was not necessarily negative. It was this ambivalence in Italian foreign policy that initially hindered a full Italian alignment with Germany.

By 1937, the Italian interest in the pact had changed, as the Mussolini administration desired to have its own military alliance with Japan and felt that accession to the agreement would be the easiest way to forge the triangular alliance with Germany and Japan that the Italian government desired. Ciano commented in his diary on 2 November 1937 that the pact, while anti-communist in name, was instead &quot;clearly anti-British&quot;. The protocol of Italy&#x27;s entry was signed on 6 November 1937.

It should be pointed out that, as a result of the phrasing of the treaty, Italy was, from a purely legal argument, required to only adhere to the main text and the public supplementary protocol, but not to the secret protocol that had the specific military directives against the Soviet Union.

In reaction to the Italian accession to the pact, the British government saw the traditional British dominance in the Mediterranean (Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, and Egypt (Suez Canal)) threatened by a potentially resurgent Italy backed with German industrial and military power. Robert Vansittart, a prominent critic of the British Appeasement policy under Neville Chamberlain, warned that Italy, with its recent acquisitions in the war against Ethiopia, threatened a pincer movement against Egypt and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and that Mussolini, due to his personality, could not be deterred even by Italy&#x27;s economic instability from a potential military adventure against the United Kingdom.

=== Attempts to develop the pact into a military alliance ===
After the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact and especially after Italy&#x27;s entry, Ribbentrop continued his efforts to form it into a full military alliance. This mirrored the thoughts of Ribbentrop, Raumer, Ōshima and Hitler during the treaty&#x27;s creation, as the original draft that Hitler signed off on in Bayreuth had likely included military terms that were explicitly both defensive as well as offensive. This was prevented by the intervention of Japanese diplomats around Shigenori Tōgō.

After the pact&#x27;s conclusion, Ribbentrop&#x27;s efforts to transform it into a military alliance continued, although his agenda was driven by the concern with war against the western allies, whereas Hitler&#x27;s main primary concern had been to eliminate the Soviet Union. Ribbentrop in his function as German ambassador to the United Kingdom recommended to Hitler in his report of 28 December 1937 and his final conclusions of 2 January 1938 the creation of a strong anti-British alliance with the ability to threaten the United Kingdom in a way that would either compel it to stay neutral or in the case of war be able to defeat it.

Ribbentrop&#x27;s political power within the German foreign service grew massively when he was named foreign minister as a replacement for Konstantin von Neurath on 4 February 1938. This was part of the reshuffle of army, air force and foreign service caused by the dismissal of Werner von Blomberg and Werner von Fritsch. In this military-political purge, Hitler removed twelve generals (not counting Blomberg and Fritsch) and reassigned 51 other military posts. The removal of Neurath, Fritsch and Blomberg marked the elimination of large parts of the &#x27;moderate&#x27; faction in the cabinet Hitler, where as the &#x27;extremists&#x27; remained: Goebbels, Hess, Rosenberg and Ribbentrop.

The May Crisis of 1938, when there was a perception of aggressive German troop movements against Czechoslovakia, brought with it strong diplomatic reactions from France and Britain that went contrary to the established Appeasement policy. As a result, Ribbentrop renewed his pressure on Hitler to formalize the Anti-Comintern Pact into a full military alliance for the case of war against the United Kingdom and France. He eventually also gained the support of Bernardo Attolico, Italian ambassador to Germany, for the idea.

In early January 1939, Ribbentrop was certain of his progress in transforming the pact into an alliance. Mussolini, who had by now given up his attempts at Italian diplomatic ambivalence between the United Kingdom and Germany and fully committed to Italian alliance with Germany, gave his agreement as well. Mussolini also advocated to even expand this prospective alliance to include Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania.
Henceforth, from January 1939 onward, Italy and Germany cooperated on their draft of a military alliance, but Japan was cautious to commit. While the political lobby of the Japanese army was generally in favor of the conclusion of a military alliance with Germany, particularly in order to contain the Soviet Union, the Japanese navy continued to view the prospect of an alliance with Germany as of no particular use for Japan&#x27;s naval strategic position and as a potential diplomatic and economic blunder, as Japan&#x27;s navy alone would not be sufficient to hold off British and American naval forces if an alliance with Germany would lead Japan into war with either of the Anglo-American powers, thus cutting off Japan, dependent on vital shipping routes.

The overall Japanese attitude, still anti-Soviet rather than anti-British, did not fit with the German and Italian designs to openly antagonize the United Kingdom. The Japanese foreign service did not wish to be drawn into a war between the nations of Western Europe and as a result aimed to differentiate between the Axis Powers&#x27; designs against the UK and those against the USSR. Ribbentrop&#x27;s designs were thus rejected by the Japanese delegates, who insisted on the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s initial anti-communist designs and were unwilling to see an anti-British component added to it.

Eventually, Japanese caution led Ribbentrop to settle for only a bilateral alliance rather than the trilateral one he had hoped for, and the Pact of Steel was signed between Germany and Italy on 22 May 1939. The Pact of Steel&#x27;s capabilities were commented on by Ciano as &quot;real dynamite&quot;. The Pact of Steel enabled Germany to proceed in its aggressive posturing against Poland, as this issue did not necessarily require Japanese consent or support, but Ribbentrop also desired to expand the Pact of Steel and include Japan in it. However, Japanese stalling tactics continued, and Germany wanted to eliminate the Soviet Union as a potential factor in its war against Poland.

As a result, Ribbentrop started seriously pondering a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; with the USSR on the question of Eastern Europe&#x27;s future. This would mark a complete betrayal of the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s provision to not make bilateral treaties with the Soviet Union without Japanese consent, but Germany proceeded nonetheless. In May 1939, Ribbentrop instructed Friedrich-Werner Graf von der Schulenburg to initiate a German-Soviet rapprochement on the basis that the newly forged Pact of Steel marked a turn in Germany&#x27;s foreign policy, away from anti-Soviet towards anti-British and anti-French diplomacy. Ribbentrop also promised to redirect Japanese anti-Soviet foreign policy into a state where Japan and the USSR would no longer have to stand in rivalry.

At this stage, Ribbentrop also started envisioning a bloc of four, where the Soviet Union would be included with Germany, Italy and Japan to form a quadripartite faction against British influence. This marked a complete deviation from Nazi policy, particularly the Hitlerian goal of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, and was one of the many iterations of Ribbentrop&#x27;s all-encompassing foreign political goal of containing by all possible means the influence of the United Kingdom. This &quot;Euro-Asiatic bloc of four&quot;, as historian Wolfgang Michalka calls it, ultimately failed because of the differences between Germany, the Soviet Union and Japan. Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939.

=== Entry of Hungary and Manchukuo ===
Hungary joined the agreement on 24 February 1939. It received the invitation to the pact on 13 January, after the Hungarian foreign minister István Csáky announced on 12 January that Hungary would accept an invitation if it were to receive one. It was the first member with some independence outside of the big three, and it was subsequently the first country to be denied first-class status among the pact&#x27;s members, thus establishing the division between Germany, Italy and Japan as the leading nations of the pact and the remaining countries as their subordinates. This superior status of the three leading countries was later formalized in the extension of the pact on 25 November 1941.

The pact proved unpopular in Hungary, particularly as Hungary&#x27;s long-standing ally Poland became Germany&#x27;s target. In his memoirs, Hungary&#x27;s strongman Miklós Horthy would later complain that Germany had unduly involved itself in Hungarian domestic affairs even before Hungary&#x27;s accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, and that German media had no place to insist that Hungary had a &#x27;bill to pay&#x27; after profiting from German diplomatic intervention on her behalf during the First Vienna Award. However, the German archives show that a clear &quot;quid pro quo&quot; had been made between Germany and Hungary: in exchange for the German support for Hungarian territorial expansion into southern Slovakia and Carpatho-Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister Kálmán Darányi specifically promised Hungary would leave the League of Nations and join the Anti-Comintern Pact.

Another country that joined the pact on 24 February 1939 was the Japanese-established Empire of Manchukuo. Manchukuo received the invitation on 16 January and the accession protocol was signed in Changchun on 24 February.

The entry of Hungary and Manchukuo was celebrated by the German state-controlled &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; as the &quot;growth of the front against bolshevism&quot; and the &quot;consolidation of a world order&quot;.

=== Entry of Spain ===
Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spain joined the pact on 27 March 1939, the same day that the surrender of the Spanish Republicans at the end of the Siege of Madrid brought about the end of the Spanish Civil War. The accelerated addition of Spain to the Anti-Comintern Pact, with the goal to counteract British influence in Spain, had been pursued by German, Italian and Japanese politicians since at least January 1939. It was specified by German State Secretary Weizsäcker that the invitation to Spain should only come from Germany, Italy, and Japan, but not from Hungary.

The Spanish side delayed the accession to the pact, as the Franco leadership feared intervention by the Allied powers on the Republican side should the Nationalists side with the Axis before the war&#x27;s conclusion. Franco&#x27;s foreign minister, Jordana, accordingly stalled Spain&#x27;s entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact until the end of the Spanish Civil War.

Spain&#x27;s membership in the pact was proof of Spanish alignment with the European fascists, and the nationalist success in the Spanish Civil War became a justification for the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s continued activity and as a confirmation of the pact&#x27;s value.

In the British House of Commons, Spain&#x27;s entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact was viewed with suspicion, particularly in regards to the safety of Gibraltar and by extension Malta, British Egypt and Mandatory Palestine. The British government, after nationalist victory had become obvious, had attempted to quickly improve relations with the new government in Madrid, but the progress on Anglo-Spanish relations received a setback with the Spanish entry into the pact.

France, although nominally also interested in positive relations with the falangists as seen in the Bérard-Jordana Agreement of 25 February 1939, made even less headway than the British. After Spanish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact, there was a Spanish military buildup in colonial Morocco, and the Franco government further worsened tensions by refusing to allow the re-entry of refugees that had fled the country in the closing days of the Spanish Civil War.

=== Other considerations, 1938–1939 ===
A candidate for membership in the eyes of the Axis Powers was the Second Polish Republic. Poland had cooperated with Germany on the occupations of Czechoslovak territory after the Munich Agreement and seemed like an approachable partner, but the German offers of a Polish membership in the pact were tied to a return of Danzig to Germany, something that Poland was unwilling to accept out of concern for its access to the sea and its policy of equal diplomatic distance between Germany and the Soviet Union.

In January 1939, the Axis Powers were courting the Stojadinović government in Yugoslavia to attempt to induce Yugoslavia to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The attempts failed when Stojadinović&#x27;s government fell on 5 February 1939 and Stojadinović was replaced with Dragiša Cvetković as Prime Minister, which came as a surprise to the Axis Powers, who had believed Stojadinović was secure in office. While there were hopes among the Axis that Stojadinović might return to power, this failed to materialize.

In February 1939, the German military leadership, independent from the foreign ministry, increased the pressure on Bulgaria to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Georg Thomas explained to the Bulgarian delegation during negotiations regarding German armament loans to Bulgaria that such loans could only be extended if Bulgaria made a clear political showing of alignment to Germany in form of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact. Weizsäcker complained to the Wehrmacht high command about this incident. Thomas subsequently claimed to Weizsäcker that he was acting on the direct orders of Hermann Göring. In a subsequent conversation between the Bulgarian delegate and Weizsäcker, it was made clear that Bulgaria was not prepared to join the Anti-Comintern Pact at that time. Bulgaria would not join the agreement until 25 November 1941.

In the run up to the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia in the rump territories of Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovak accession into the Anti-Comintern Pact was part of the numerous demands Hitler made on the Czechs as a pretext to justify the invasion after the inevitable non-compliance.

=== Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact ===

The pact&#x27;s legitimacy was undermined when Germany blatantly broke it by secretly negotiating the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviet Union. During the negotiations between Ribbentrop and Stalin in Moscow in August 1939, just a few weeks before the outbreak of World War II, the Anti-Comintern Pact proved only a small obstacle. Ribbentrop told Stalin that the Anti-Comintern Pact had been aimed against the western democracies, not the Soviet Union.

Stalin accepted this for the sake of his country&#x27;s diplomatic goals, and there were jokes made among the German public that the Soviet Union would end up joining the Anti-Comintern Pact itself. Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov had not made the Anti-Comintern Pact an issue during the negotiations with Ribbentrop and German ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg.

==== Reactions within the Anti-Comintern Pact ====

===== Italy =====
On the backdrop of the preparations for World War II, the Italian reaction to Germany&#x27;s actions was ambivalent. The Italian population&#x27;s pre-existing anti-German and anti-war sentiments were not helped at all by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, but Mussolini&#x27;s personal opinion was more divided. Mussolini, although sometimes of the opinion that neutrality was preferable, felt compelled by personal loyalty, fear of Hitler&#x27;s disapproval, as well as the prospect of easy war spoils, that Italy should stand by Germany&#x27;s side, especially if an Allied act of appeasement in Poland could result in a swift Italian victory in Yugoslavia. Italian involvement in the war was opposed by an anti-war faction in the Italian government around Ciano, who attempted to prevent Italy&#x27;s entry into World War II and to break the alliance between Germany and Italy, to which Mussolini at times carefully agreed if a long enough time frame was given to dissolve the alliance.

The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact confirmed numerous suspicions that the Italian public, already unenthusiastic about any diplomatic alliance with Germany, had about the Germans. This diplomatic betrayal, combined with the eventual defeat of the Axis Powers in World War II, fuelled widespread germanophobia in Italian literature and popular culture in the immediate aftermath of World War II.

===== Japan =====

In the Japanese view, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was a violation of the Anti-Comintern Pact, as Germany had not revealed its negotiations with the USSR to Japan. Subsequently, the Japanese sought to settle the Soviet–Japanese Border War and abandoned any territorial aspirations against the Soviet Union. Japan had mainly intended the Anti-Comintern Pact to be directed against the Soviet Union rather than the United Kingdom, whereas the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact made it clear that the Germans, at least in 1939, were willing to aid the Soviets to the detriment of the western democracies. In response to this drastic German change in foreign policy and the Japanese defeat at Soviet hands in the border conflicts, the Hiranuma administration resigned.

Japanese Emperor Hirohito instructed the subsequent government, led by the Prime Minister Nobuyuki Abe, to be more cooperative towards the United Kingdom and the United States.

Ribbentrop attempted to win Japanese support for his &quot;bloc of four&quot; with Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union. The German foreign minister argued that if Tokyo and Moscow were to form a military coalition together with Berlin and Rome, Japan would be free to turn its attention to the potential acquisition of European colonies in South East Asia. However, the ideological barriers were too great for comfort for the Japanese leadership, and Ribbentrop failed to compel them into an alliance with the Soviet Union. He had also put himself forward as a negotiator between Japan and the USSR, but was once again cold-shouldered by both as they began to pragmatically wrap up their differences bilaterally and without German oversight. As a result of the diplomatic shakeup, Japan retreated out of Ribbentrop&#x27;s anti-British designs. Ribbentrop&#x27;s pro-Japanese diplomacy, which he had pursued in spite of the German foreign ministry&#x27;s initial favorability towards China since 1934, was now met with the largest diplomatic distance between Germany and Japan since the Nazis&#x27; rise to power.

In the aftermath of the Japanese change of attitude towards a war against the Soviet Union, Soviet-Japanese economic relations improved. Shikao Matsumisha of the Commercial Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Office and Soviet foreign minister Molotov signaled mutual interest in an improvement of Japanese–Soviet trade relations in October 1939. The two countries agreed to more permanently settle the ongoing question of Japanese fishing in Soviet waters and the payments for the Chinese Eastern Railway in Manchukuo. The Soviet Union promised that significant amounts of the money received as part of these deals would be invested back into the purchase of Japanese goods.

The Japanese intelligence agencies and foreign service, which had previously supported separatism among the Soviet Union&#x27;s ethnic minorities, also restricted their activities in this field as a result of the Soviet-Japanese rapprochement.

Starting with the German-Soviet War, the Japanese loss of interest in war with the USSR had the consequence that Japan was unwilling to open up a second front against the Soviet Union to relieve German efforts, as Japan interpreted Germany&#x27;s aggression as an insufficient reason to trigger the treaty. As a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, there was a significant cooling of German-Japanese relations between late 1939 and the summer of 1940, but after Germany&#x27;s victories in 1940, the elimination of the French and Dutch colonial powers caused Japan, interested in the acquisition of the colonies in question, to approach Germany again.

== During World War II ==
All further additions to the Anti-Comintern Pact were after 1 September 1939 and thus during World War II. The supposed purpose of the pact, as a defensive coalition against communism to counteract the potential of Soviet aggression, became outdated when most of its European member states became engaged in the German-Soviet War.

=== Effect of German military victories in the &quot;Westfeldzug&quot; ===

In March 1940, Joachim von Ribbentrop once again set about mobilizing Italy, the Soviet Union and especially Japan for his vision of a four-power coalition against the British Empire. In June 1940, the overwhelming German victories in the (&quot;Western Campaign&quot;) saw the defeat of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. With French Indochina and the Dutch East Indies now effectively defenseless, the Tokyo government now felt enticed to once again diplomatically approach Germany, which it had previously distanced itself from after the German &quot;quid pro quo&quot; with the USSR. The Germans had also won some support with the Japanese ambassadors in Berlin and Rome, Hiroshi Ōshima and Toshio Shiratori, who were swayed by Germany&#x27;s successes in the Polish campaign and started supporting Ribbentrop&#x27;s diplomatic agenda.
Japan, concerned that Germany might actually take the side of France and the Netherlands, possibly then reshaped to be German vassal states, in the colonial question, sought to assure Germany&#x27;s support for a Japanese annexation of French and Dutch colonies in South East Asia. Ribbentrop was indeed willing to support such Japanese annexations, which had been part of his initial idea regarding the four-power pact&#x27;s advantages from the Japanese perspective. He painted Japanese acquisitions in East Asia as preparations for a world order where all of Afro-Eurasia would be divided between Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union.

Again, Ribbentrop thus tried to realize his vision of a four-power coalition directed against the United Kingdom. With France eliminated and the Battle of Britain going in Britain&#x27;s favor, it became more and more clear that the United Kingdom, although on the back foot, would neither seek a truce nor be knocked out by German invasion. As a result, the role of the still neutral United States and the American support for the UK became more and more important for the conduct of Germany&#x27;s war effort. Ribbentrop still deluded himself that cooperation with the Soviet Union could be permanent or at least last until the war with the United Kingdom had concluded. This opinion was not shared by Adolf Hitler, who still viewed the &#x27;Jewish-Bolshevist&#x27; Soviet Union as Germany&#x27;s inevitable final enemy.

=== Tripartite Pact===

Differences between Germany and Japan, including the Japanese war in China, economic differences, and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, led to a growing distance between Germany and Japan. Germany&#x27;s victories over the European allies in 1940 led to a desire for a reconciliation between the parties. This came to pass as part of the Tripartite Pact of 27 September 1940. However, the Japanese distrust in the German partner remained, and Japan avoided entanglement in Germany&#x27;s eventual war against the Soviet Union to fully focus on its own struggle in China. In the Tripartite Pact, the Germans and Italians recognized the Japanese leadership in East Asia, and Japan conversely recognized German and Italian leadership in Europe.

=== Extension of the pact ===
The Anti-Comintern Pact was scheduled to be renewed on 25 November 1941, as its five-year lifespan since 25 November 1936 was about to run out. One of Germany&#x27;s primary aims was to keep Japan close and to encourage Japan to intervene in the German-Soviet War on Germany&#x27;s side, but Japan refused to do so for the rest of the war. The Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, signed in April 1941, would hold up until August 1945, when the Soviet Union violated the pact and invaded Japanese Manchuria.

The convention of the various signatories between 24 and 25 November 1941 in Berlin that led to the renewal of the pact was described by Ciano in his diaries as affirmation of the Germans as &quot;masters of the house&quot; within the Axis Powers. Attendants included Galeazzo Ciano of Italy, Serrano Suñer of Spain, László Bárdossy of Hungary and Mihai Antonescu of Romania, among others.

The extension protocol was signed on 25 November 1941 and bears the signatures of representatives of the six previous signatories: Ribbentrop (Germany), Ōshima (Japan), Ciano (Italy), Bárdossy (Hungary), Lü Yiwen (Manchukuo), and Suñer (Spain).

The previous signatories rejoined the pact.

In addition, several new countries that had not done so before 25 November 1941 joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. China under Wang Jingwei submitted its signature ahead of time on 22 November 1941, the other countries submitted theirs on the day of signing, the 25th.

* Nanjing China

The reaction to the extension in the German state-controlled press, unlike with the previous protocol, was very cold towards Japan and instead emphasized the sacrifices and successes of the European Axis against the Soviet Union in the German-Soviet War. This would not change significantly until 7 December 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

==== Bulgaria ====
Bulgaria had been a country that was stuck between its own expansionist ambitions in the Balkans for which it relied on Italian and German military assistance and diplomatic support, while also trying to avoid major entanglement in Axis operations. Its leader Boris III, hailed as a &quot;liberator czar&quot; and a unifier of lost Bulgarian territories, could only achieve this status due to the military support of the Axis armies, but was intent in 1941 on avoiding Bulgarian involvement in the German-Soviet War on the Eastern Front. This was successful and Bulgarian troops did not participate in Operation Barbarossa, but the permanence of Bulgaria&#x27;s territorial claims remained completely at the mercy of the Axis Powers, as Germany in particular was hesitant to view any territorial settlement in the Balkans after the Axis victories over Greece and Yugoslavia as final. As a result, Bulgaria was forced to please the German partner as much as possible while avoiding the final step of open hostilities against the Soviet Union.

As part of this pro-German position, Bulgaria was essentially forced into membership in the Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1941. Soon after, on 13 December, the country declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. Bulgaria tried to maintain neutrality towards the Soviet Union until the end, but after Romania switched sides in favor of the Allies and allowed the Red Army to pass through Romanian territory to invade Bulgaria, the 1944 Bulgarian coup d&#x27;état paved the way to the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria. Tsar Simeon II&#x27;s regents were executed.

==== Croatia ====
Croatia, Germany&#x27;s most important partner on the Balkans during the anti-partisan campaigns, had been created in 1941 following the German occupation of Yugoslavia. It joined the Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1941. Such an accession was done with the goal to legitimize the Croatian state and make it look more independent, but also to take a clear stand against the Soviet Union.

==== Denmark ====
Denmark had, along with Norway, been occupied by Germany in the wake of Operation Weserübung that started on 9 April 1940. The government in Copenhagen responded to the German assault by having the Danish army stand down and accepting what was framed by Germany as protective occupation. The Danish decision was vastly different from the Norwegian one, as the government in Oslo chose to fight rather than to surrender, and as a result, the German occupation of Denmark was among the lightest of any of the German occupations in Europe.

Still, any notion of Danish independence was merely a sham for the purpose of foreign propaganda, and the German authorities watched their Danish counterparts closely. While there was a considerable spectrum of sympathy for the German cause among the Danish public, most Danish civilians resented their occupiers and the German military authorities doubted Danish compliance and loyalty. German attempts to improve their standing in public opinion in Denmark, through measures such as the establishment of the Danish-German Society with Peter Knutzen as chairman, were unsuccessful.

The Danish government requested four key exemptions specific to Denmark.

* Denmark takes up no military obligations.
* Anti-communist action in Denmark should be limited to police operations.
* The treaty should be limited to Danish territory.
* Denmark will remain neutral in World War II.

The Germans, somewhat unhappy with these requests, moved them into a secret addendum as a compromise, making Denmark appear as a full member of the pact from the outside. This damaged the international reputation of the Danish civilian government among the Allies.

==== Finland ====
In Finland, the status of the country during the Second World War remains controversial into the modern day, as historians debate whether Finland was a full member of the Axis Powers or was, as was claimed by the wartime Finnish government, just in a state of co-belligerence (, ) with Germany in the shared Finnish-German struggle against the Soviet Union. Finnish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941, alongside other elements such as the Finland&#x27;s explicit acknowledgement of having been an ally of &quot;Hitlerite Germany&quot; in the 1947 Peace Treaty, form the case in favour of arguing that Finland was part of the Axis Powers.

==== Nanjing China ====
The &quot;Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China,&quot; also referred to as &quot;China-Nanjing&quot; or the Wang Jingwei regime, a Japanese puppet state established in Nanjing by the defeated Nationalist Party politician Wang Jingwei in March 1940, joined the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941. It had submitted its signature to the treaty ahead of time, on 22 November.

==== Romania ====
Romania was Germany&#x27;s most militarily important partner in the war against the Soviet Union, but its German partners had done little to actively earn that loyalty. Germany had in quick succession overseen three territorial losses in Romania, when it first awarded the Bessarabia region to the Soviet Union in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, then granted large parts of the Transylvania region to Hungary as part of the Second Vienna Award, and finally approved of Bulgarian territorial gains in the Dobruja region as part of the Treaty of Craiova. Romania, under the leadership of the fascist Iron Guard, thus had its main enemies not only in the Soviet Union, but also among the ranks of the Axis Powers, especially in the form of Hungary. Still, the Iron Guard, which had before the territorial losses advocated a pro-German position, now viewed alignment with Germany as the only way to avoid another German intervention against Romania and in favor of Hungary. The Romanian participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941 thus arose out of the necessity to please the German partner and to further the Romanian campaign against the Soviet Union, to hopefully regain Bessarabia, and to make territorial acquisitions in Soviet Ukraine.

==== Slovakia ====
Slovakia, established in 1939 after the German-instigated dissolution of Czechoslovakia, joined the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941.

== Suggested memberships ==
Between 1936 and 1945, the Axis Powers used the Anti-Comintern Pact as a diplomatic tool to increase their political and diplomatic leverage, but were often unsuccessful.

=== Argentina, Brazil, and Chile ===

There were efforts by Germany to involve the South American (&quot;ABC States&quot;), consisting of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, into the pact.

Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas had established the new November 1937 constitution of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; under the pretext of communist insurgency, and Brazil was thus considered the prime entry point for the Anti-Comintern Pact in South America. The Brazilian government promised that its domestic anti-communist conviction would continue, but declined entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact on the basis that it did not wish to diplomatically offend the United Kingdom or the United States. However, Brazilian minister showed interest in German help for a Brazilian Anti-Comintern Exhibition similar to the ones that had already been held in Germany.

=== China ===
China was part of Ribbentrop&#x27;s vision for the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1935, and had been courted by both Germany and Japan to join the Anti-Comintern Pact as early as 1936. By late 1935, Wang Jingwei was in favor of joining the pact, but Chiang Kai-shek was careful not to offend the Soviet Union, which was China&#x27;s only potential partner in case of a Japanese attack.

After serious consideration, the Chiang administration refused. They were unwilling to align with Japan without a retreat of Japanese forces from China. Such a retreat was rejected by Japan, which meant that China was unwilling to offend the Soviet Union, the only major power that would be able to effectively aid them in the case of a war against Japan. This war became reality in the following year. On 3 November 1938, Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe in a public broadcast offered peace terms that included Chinese accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact.

Between December 1939 and March 1940, preliminary peace talks were carried out under the Japanese &quot;Kiri Project&quot;. The drafted terms involved Chinese accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Chinese government stalled for time and did not give a definitive answer to the proposal. By 7 September, the Japanese side declared further negotiation useless and &quot;Kiri Project&quot; was terminated on 8 October 1940. Another attempt at exploratory peace talks was made by for the Chinese side, who had two delegates with Yōsuke Matsuoka in Tokyo on 12 October 1940. Their proposal for peace between Japan and China and the unification of the Wang and Chiang governments also included the entry of the unified Chinese state into the Anti-Comintern Pact.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
Czechoslovakia&#x27;s accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact was part of the German demands in the run-up to the establishment of the Protectorate. These demands were designed by Germany to be rejected.

=== Netherlands ===
The Netherlands were a candidate of choice for the Japanese for inclusion in the Anti-Comintern Pact.&quot;&quot; Japanese ambassador Iwao Yamaguchi hoped that Dutch concerns about the situation in China and the potential dissent of the ethnic Chinese inhabitants of the Dutch East Indies, as well as communist insurgents in the colony, would lead the Dutch government to attempt to stabilize the relationship with Japan through accession to the pact.

Yamaguchi contacted the Dutch foreign minister Andries Cornelis Dirk de Graeff about the matter on 12 October 1936, but the Dutch government saw itself bound by public opinion to reject any diplomatic alignment with Japan, and De Graeff pointed out that communist activity in the Dutch East Indies was not an imminent threat. However, he was willing to at least negotiate an intelligence exchange with Japan for the purpose of anti-communist activity in Asia. A second meeting on 24 October 1936 saw De Graeff outline that only the Dutch East Indies should be included in any intelligence exchange, whereas Yamaguchi hoped to include the Dutch mainland for the purpose of thwarting Comintern operations in Amsterdam (and covertly influencing the Dutch newspapers to be less critical of Japan in their reporting). The following day, 25 October 1936, Tony Lovink contacted Yamaguchi about a potential Dutch policy in which not only communism but all political ideologies in the Dutch East Indies could be suppressed and supervised in cooperation with the Japanese. This was the first of many signs that the Dutch government was not greatly concerned about fighting communism, but was much rather concerned with suppressing the Indonesian independence movement in the Dutch East Indies.&quot;&quot;

Although the Netherlands remained interested in secretive intelligence exchanges, the Dutch government was hesitant to officially undertake a diplomatic alignment with Japan, caused by the fear of domestic and diplomatic backlash.&quot;&quot;

=== Norway ===
As part of the German occupation of Norway and Norway&#x27;s collaborationist Quisling regime, the accession of Quisling Norway to the Anti-Comintern Pact was discussed, most notably in the German (&quot;Memorandum Regarding the Reorganization of Norway&quot;), issued in Oslo on 10 February 1942.&quot;&quot;

=== Poland ===
In 1935, Poland had been one of the countries that Ribbentrop had hoped to induce to join the pact.&#x27; Poland was also a very desired partner in Japan, which viewed Germany and Poland as rather close because of their 1934 Non-Aggression Pact and which viewed Poland as very committed in its anti-communist and anti-Soviet stances.&#x27;

When Ribbentrop and Neurath were in contact with Józef Lipski and Józef Beck about German-Polish anti-communist cooperation, Beck rejected a Polish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact as impractical.&#x27; The Polish entry into the Anti-Comintern Pact was part of the eight-point plan presented to Poland by Joachim von Ribbentrop.&#x27;&#x27; Poland rejected this proposal. The reasons for Poland&#x27;s rejection of the proposal were the Polish desire for a diplomatic equidistance between Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as military concerns about encroaching encirclement by Germany after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.&#x27;

=== Portugal ===
Portugal was of interest as a possible member state, especially after Spain joined. As one of the only three countries to have voted against the Soviet Union&#x27;s entry into the League of Nations on 18 September 1934 (in addition to the Netherlands and Switzerland), it had a well-established anti-Soviet record. However, its economic dependency on and long-standing diplomatic alliance with the United Kingdom made Portugal unlikely to accept an invitation to the Anti-Comintern Pact in the eyes of Oswald Baron von Hoyningen-Huene, the German ambassador to Portugal 1934–1945.&quot;&quot;

=== United Kingdom ===
British membership was part of Ribbentrop&#x27;s original design for the Anti-Comintern Pact in October 1935.&#x27; When Joachim von Ribbentrop became ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1936, Hitler made clear to him that it was his &#x27;greatest wish&#x27; to welcome Britain into the Anti-Comintern Pact. Ribbentrop was sceptical of Hitler&#x27;s ambition, but placed some hope in King Edward VIII, who Ribbentrop perceived to be friendly to Germany.&#x27;&quot;&quot; When asked on 15 November 1937 whether the British government had received an invitation to the Anti-Comintern Pact, Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Robert Gascoyne-Cecil answered that no such invitation had taken place.

=== Yugoslavia ===
Yugoslavia was Axis-friendly during the tenure of Milan Stojadinović as Prime Minister, and Germany and Italy were optimistic about its accession in January 1939.&#x27; Stojadinović was however ousted in February 1939, and the subsequent Cvetković administration was more cautious and non-aligned.&#x27; The Cvetković administration, pressured by the diplomatic alignment of Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria with the Axis Powers, joined the Anti-Comintern Pact&#x27;s successor, the Tripartite Pact, on 25 March 1941. Dušan Simović, in response, Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état on 27 March, cancelling Yugoslavia&#x27;s entry into the Tripartite Pact. In response, the Axis Powers initiated the invasion of Yugoslavia on 6 April.&quot;&quot;

== Legacy ==
The Anti-Comintern Pact ended up playing a significant role at the Nuremberg trials and was specifically mentioned in the verdict that sentenced Joachim von Ribbentrop to death.&quot;&quot;

=== Historical reception and historiography ===

American historian Paul W. Schroeder, professor emeritus of the University of Illinois, interprets the Anti-Comintern Pact in his 1958 book &quot;The Axis Alliance and Japanese-American Relations 1941&quot; as a diplomatic statement by Germany and Japan that had no actual military value and was &quot;hardly dangerous in itself&quot;.&#x27; Schroeder also comments on the rather loose German-Japanese ties that resulted from the pact,&#x27; as well as the lack of German and Japanese commitment towards the agreement.&#x27; Schroeder&#x27;s conclusion ultimately sees in the Anti-Comintern Pact a continuation of a pattern in Japanese foreign policy since the 1890s in which Japan was opportunistic in grasping at chances at expansion, as in the First Sino-Japanese War 1894, the Russo-Japanese War 1904 and the twenty-one demands of 1915.&#x27;
Ruth Henig, British historian and later politician for the Labour Party, noted in her 1985 book &quot;The Origins of the Second World War 1933–1941&quot; the agreement&#x27;s ideological component, in that the Anti-Comintern pact underlined the &quot;onward march of fascism&quot; in order &quot;to combat the spread of communist regimes&quot;, but pointed out that a real threat from the pact also came to the liberal democratic United Kingdom.&#x27; In a 2001 contribution to &quot;The Paris Peace Conference, 1919: Peace Without Victory&quot;, Henig also notes that the public in Germany, Italy, Japan and even the United Kingdom itself was largely uninterested in foreign policy and the assurance of international peace, and that those few individuals who took an active interest in global affairs often did so chauvinistically and nationalistically. Henig also commented that the interwar period 1918–1939 was marked by the breakup of old alliances (like the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the Stresa Front).&#x27;
As part of the German Bundeswehr&#x27;s Military History Research Office&#x27;s series &quot;Germany and the Second World War&quot;, German military historian Manfred Messerschmidt states in the first volume, &quot;The Build-up of German Aggression&quot; (1990), that the Anti-Comintern Pact, just like the Axis Powers as a whole, was just a &quot;patching together of divergent political interests&quot;. Messerschmidt also comments on Hitler&#x27;s ambivalence between including either Italy or the United Kingdom in the pact.&#x27; In regards to the role of Japan, Messerschmidt, like Schroeder, sees the Anti-Comintern Pact as a continuation of established Japanese policy, but also notes that Japan&#x27;s internal political apparatus was so divided between the interests of the Japanese army, navy and government that almost by definition no action by the Tokyo leadership could be seen as any sort of unified opinion of the entire Japanese establishment. Messerschmidt also disagrees with the notion that Italy&#x27;s accession to the pact necessarily gave it an anti-British thrust, but that Italian accession established a basis of the treaty in the first place. The interests of Germany and Japan were too different and the Japanese position after the beginning of the war against China in 1937 too weak to pose a threat to any enemy, Soviet Union or United Kingdom. As a result, Messerschmidt disagrees with the idea that the pact went from anti-Soviet to anti-British on the basis that it effectively already stopped being anti-Soviet as soon as Japan invaded China in June 1937, not when Italy joined the agreement in November of that same year.&#x27;

However, Messerschmidt does agree that Hitler&#x27;s support for Japan, which followed from Ribbentrop&#x27;s agenda in the far east, was destined to hurt Anglo-German relations, whether Hitler intended it or not. The actions that Germany took that favored Japan and disfavored China included the cessation of aid deliveries to the Chiang government, the recall of advisors from China and open declarations of political support for Japanese actions starting in October 1937. All of these actions, according to Messerschmidt&#x27;s argument, were bound to offend the pro-Chinese position of the United Kingdom.&quot;&quot;
In his biography of Adolf Hitler, British historian Sir Ian Kershaw wrote in 2000 that Hitler&#x27;s approval for the Anti-Comintern Pact marked the diplomatic union of &quot;the two most militaristic, expansionist powers in the world&quot;, but that &quot;[t]he pact was more important for its symbolism than for its actual provisions&quot;.&#x27; Kershaw in his interpretation of the power structures within Nazi Germany is a proponent of the &quot;working towards the Führer&quot; thesis, in which, while Hitler was the guiding ideological figure in the German state whose favor all political actors within the German government (in case of the Anti-Comintern Pact: Ribbentrop) attempted to win, the dictator was in fact rather uninvolved in day-to-day governmental matters.&#x27;

<text>Lingayen Gulf is a large gulf on northwestern Luzon in the Philippines, stretching . It is framed by the provinces of Pangasinan and La Union and sits between the Zambales Mountains and the Cordillera Central. The Agno River and the Balili River drain into Lingayen Gulf.

==Geography==

The gulf has numerous islands, the most famous of which are in the Hundred Islands National Park. This tourist attraction features 123 islands, the majority of which are small in size. The largest island is Cabarruyan Island, which constitutes the municipality of Anda, Pangasinan, followed by Santiago Island at the mouth of the Gulf.

The shore from Labrador to San Fabian is characterized by a long grey-sand beach. Other well-known beaches are at Bonuan-Tondaligan, Bolinao and San Fernando City. The waters of Lingayen Gulf are murky due to its sandy bottom. Coral reefs were all but destroyed by dynamite fishing, although efforts are made to restore some, especially inside the Hundred Islands National Park.

A number of cities are found along the gulf&#x27;s coast such as Dagupan and Alaminos in Pangasinan, and San Fernando City, the capital of La Union. Lingayen, the capital of Pangasinan, also lies on the shores of the gulf.

===River sources===
The gulf has five major river sources. Flowing from the province of Pangasinan in the south are the Agno, Dagupan and Angalacan-Bued rivers. From the east in the province of La Union flow the Aringay and Bauang rivers.

==History==

During World War II, Lingayen Gulf proved a strategically important theatre of war between American and Japanese forces. On 22 December 1941, the Japanese 14th Army under Lieutenant General Masaharu Homma landed on the eastern part of the gulf at San Fernando City, Bauang, Santiago, Caba, Aringay, Agoo, and Santo Tomas, where they engaged in a number of relatively minor skirmishes with the defenders, a poorly equipped contingent of predominantly Filipino and American troops, and managed to successfully invade and occupy the gulf. Following the defeat, the next day General MacArthur issued the order to retreat from Luzon and withdraw to Bataan. For the next three years, the gulf remained under Japanese occupation prior to the Lingayen Gulf landings.

At 09:30 on 9 January 1945, the U.S. 6th Army conducted an amphibious landing on the gulf, following a devastating naval bombardment, with 68,000 troops landing on the first day alone, and a total of 203,608 in following landings along a beachhead, stretching from Sual, Lingayen, and Dagupan (XIV Corps) in the west, and San Fabian (I Corps) into the east.

Despite the Americans&#x27; success in driving out the Japanese army encamped at the gulf, the Americans suffered relatively heavy losses, particularly on their convoys due to Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; suicide attacks. From 13 December 1944 through 13 January 1945, a total of 24 ships were sunk and 67 damaged by &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes, including the battleships and (accidentally hit by friendly fire), the heavy cruiser USS Louisville, the light cruiser , and the minesweepers and .

Following the amphibious landings, Lingayen Gulf was turned into a vast supply depot for the rest of the war to support the American and Filipino assaults on Manila and the rest of Luzon, and from there to Okinawa.

===Commemoration===
On January 9, 2008, Gov. Amado Espino Jr. and Vice Gov. Marlyn Primicias-Agabas established an annual commemoration to honor the war veterans. The resolution named January 9 as Pangasinan Veterans&#x27; Day. On the 63rd anniversary of the Lingayen Gulf landings, President Fidel Ramos (a West Point graduate) appealed to U.S. President George W. Bush on behalf of 24,000 surviving war veterans to pass two legislative bills pending since 1968 in the U.S. House of Representatives — the Filipino Veterans’ Equity Act of 2006 and the Filipino Veterans’ Equity of 2005 sponsored by former Senator Daniel Inouye.

==Economy==
Fishing and salt-making are the primary industries on Lingayen Gulf. In fact, the name Pangasinan literally means &quot;place where salt is made&quot;. Salt is collected from seawater through evaporation, leaving the crystalline salt behind.

Lingayen Gulf is also home to the 1200 megawatt Sual Power Station, the Philippines largest coal power plant.

<text>Human hair color is the pigmentation of human hair follicles and shafts due to two types of melanin: eumelanin and pheomelanin. Generally, the more melanin present, the darker the hair. Its tone depends on the ratio of black or brown eumelanin to yellow or red pheomelanin. Melanin levels can vary over time, causing a person&#x27;s hair color to change, and one person can have hair follicles of more than one color. Some hair colors are associated with some ethnic groups because of the observed higher frequency of particular hair colors within their geographical region, e.g. straight, dark hair amongst East Asians, Southeast Asians, Polynesians, some Central Asians, and Native Americans; a large variety of dark, fair, curly, straight, wavy or bushy amongst Europeans, West Asians, some Central Asians, and North Africans; and curly, dark, and uniquely helical hair amongst Sub Saharan Africans. Bright red hair is found in some European populations, and hair turns gray, white, or &quot;silver&quot; with age. 

==Genetics and biochemistry of hair color==

The full genetic basis of hair color is complex and not fully understood. Regulatory DNA is believed to be closely involved in pigmentation in humans in general, and a 2011 study by Branicki et al. identified 13 DNA variations across 11 different genes that could be used to predict hair color.

Two types of pigment give hair its color, black-brown eumelanin and reddish-brown/reddish-yellow pheomelanin, synthesized by melanocytes. Inside the melanocytes, tyrosine is converted into L-DOPA and then L-dopaquinone, which in turn is formed into pheomelanin or eumelanin.

Different hair color phenotypes arise primarily as a result of varying ratios of these two pigments in the human population, although Europeans show the greatest range in pigmentation overall. In addition, other genetic and environmental factors can affect hair color in humans; for instance, mutations in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene can lead to red or auburn hair, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation can damage hair and alter its pigmentation. Ultraviolet radiation (UV radiation) triggers greater synthesis of several compounds, including pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), α-MSH, and ACTH, the result being increased eumelanin production. UV radiation most commonly comes from the sun, and thus populations from places closer to the equator tend to have darker hair, because eumelanin is generally more photoprotective than pheomelanin.

Pheomelanin colors hair orange and red. Eumelanin, which has two subtypes of black or brown, determines the darkness of the hair color; more black eumelanin leads to blacker hair and more brown eumelanin to browner hair. All human hair has some amount of both pigments. Over 95% of melanin content in black and brown hair is eumelanin. Pheomelanin is generally found in elevated concentrations in blond and red hair, representing about one-third of total melanin content. If there is no black eumelanin, the result is strawberry blond. Blond hair results from small amounts of brown eumelanin with no black eumelanin.

==Natural hair colors==

Natural hair color can be black, brown, blonde and red.

===Color shade scale===

The Fischer–Saller scale, named after Eugen Fischer and Karl Saller is used in physical anthropology and medicine to determine the shades of hair color. The scale uses the following designations: A (very light blond), B to E (light blond), F to L (blond), M to O (dark blond), P to T (light brown to brown), U to Y (dark brown to black) and Roman numerals I to IV (red) and V to VI (red-blond).

===Black hair===

Black hair or jet black hair is the darkest hair color. It has large amounts of eumelanin and is denser than other hair colors and is the commonly seen hair color in Asia and Africa due the fact that the people in these regions tend to have lower levels of tyrosinase in their bodies. Black eumelanin secretion causes the hair to turn black, which indicates that the MC1R is in the active state. Jet black hair, the darkest shade will not have a warm, neutral tone but a sheen which can seem almost blue, like the iridescence of a raven&#x27;s wing; hence, sometimes referred to as raven-black. Jet black hair appears to have reflective silver color in bright sunlight.

===Brown hair===
Brown hair is the second most common human hair color, after black. Brown hair is characterized by higher levels of eumelanin and lower levels of pheomelanin. Of the two types of eumelanin (black and brown), brown-haired people have brown eumelanin; they also usually have medium-thick strands of hair. Brown-haired girls or women of European, West Asian or North African descent are often known as brunettes.
Chestnut hair is a hair color which is a reddish shade of brown hair. In contrast to auburn hair, the reddish shade of chestnut is darker. Chestnut hair is common among the native peoples of Northern, Central, Western, and Eastern Europe and is also found in Asia Minor, West Asia and North Africa.

===Auburn hair===

Auburn hair ranges along a spectrum of light to dark red-brown shades. The chemicals which cause auburn hair are eumelanin (brown) and pheomelanin (red), with a higher proportion of red-causing pheomelanin than is found in average brown hair. It is most commonly found in individuals of Northern and Western European descent, but is extant in West and Central Asia and North Africa also. It can also be the result of a mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor gene.

===Red hair===

Red hair ranges from light strawberry blond shades to titian, copper, and completely red. Red hair has the highest amounts of pheomelanin, around 67%, and usually low levels of eumelanin. At 1–2% of the west Eurasian population, it is the least common hair color in the world. It is most prominently found in the British Isles and in Udmurtia. Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads; 13 percent of the population has red hair and approximately 40 percent carry the recessive redhead gene. Red hair can also occur in Southern Europe, West Asia, North Africa and Central Asia. 

===Blond hair===

Blond (sometimes &quot;blonde&quot; for women) hair ranges from pale white (platinum blond) to dark gold blond. Strawberry blond, a mixture of blond and red hair, is a much rarer type containing the most pheomelanin. Blond hair can have almost any proportion of pheomelanin and eumelanin, but has only small amounts of both. More pheomelanin creates a more golden or strawberry blond color, and more eumelanin creates an ash or sandy blond color. Blond hair is most commonly found in Northern and Northeastern Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe and also among West Asians and North Africans at lower frequencies. Studies in 2012 showed that naturally blond hair of Melanesians is caused by a recessive mutation in tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1). In the Solomon Islands, 26% of the population carry the gene; however, it is absent outside of Oceania.

===Gray and white hair===

Gray or white hair is not caused by a true gray or white pigment, but is due to a lack of pigmentation and melanin. The clear hairs appear as gray or white because of the way light is reflected from the hairs. Gray hair color typically occurs naturally as people age (see aging or achromotrichia below).

Marie Antoinette syndrome is a proposed phenomenon in which sudden whitening is caused by stress. It has been found that some hairs can become colored again when stress is reduced.

==Conditions affecting hair color==
===Aging or achromotrichia===

Children born with some hair colors may find it gradually darkens as they grow. Many blond, light brown, or red haired infants experience this. This is caused by genes being turned on and off during early childhood and puberty.

Changes in hair color typically occur naturally as people age, eventually turning the hair gray and then white. This is called achromotrichia. Achromotrichia normally begins in the early to mid-twenties in men and late twenties in women. More than 60 percent of Americans have some gray hair by age 40. The age at which graying begins seems almost entirely due to genetics. Sometimes people are born with gray hair because they inherit the trait.

The order in which graying happens is usually: nose hair, hair on the head, beard, body hair, eyebrows.

==Hair coloring==
Hair color can be changed by a chemical process. Hair coloring is classed as &quot;permanent&quot; or &quot;semi-permanent&quot;.

Permanent hair color means that the hair&#x27;s structure has been chemically altered until it is eventually cut away. This does not mean that the synthetic color will remain permanently. During the process, the natural color is removed, one or more shades, and synthetic color has been put in its place. All pigments wash out of the cuticle. Natural color stays in much longer and artificial will fade the fastest (depending on the color molecules and the form of the dye pigments).

Permanent hair color gives the most flexibility because it can make hair lighter or darker as well as changing tone and color, but there are negatives. Constant (monthly or six-weekly) maintenance is essential to match new hair growing in to the rest of the hair, and to remedy fading. A one-color permanent dye creates a flat, uniform color across the whole head, which can look unnatural and harsh, especially in a fair shade. To combat this, the modern trend is to use multiple colors—usually one color as a base with added highlights or lowlights in other shades.

Semi-permanent color washes out over a period of time—typically four to six weeks, so root regrowth is less noticeable. The final color of each strand is affected by its original color and porosity, so there will be subtle variations in color across the head—more natural and less harsh than a permanent dye. However, this means that gray and white hair will not dye to the same color as the rest of the head (in fact, some white hair will not absorb the color at all). A few gray and white hairs will blend in visually, but semi-permanent dye alone will not usually give the desired result where there is a lot of gray or white hair present. Sometimes a mixture of dyes is used while hair is greying: semi-permanent as a base color, with permanent highlights.

Semi-permanent hair color cannot lighten hair. Hair can only be lightened using chemical lighteners, such as bleach. Bleaching is always permanent because it removes the natural pigment.

&quot;Rinses&quot; are a form of temporary hair color, usually applied to hair during a shampoo and washed out again the next time the hair is washed.

<doc id="270455" wikidata="Q662534" url="?curid=270455" title="Earl of Winchilsea">
<text>Earl of Winchilsea is a title in the Peerage of England. It has been held by the Finch-Hatton family of Kent, and united with the title of Earl of Nottingham under a single holder since 1729. 

The Finch family is believed to be descended from Henry FitzHerbert, Lord Chamberlain to Henry I (r. 1100–1135).
The name change to Finch came in the 1350s after marriage to an heiress of the Finch family.
The Herbert family of Wales, Earls of Aylesford, Earls of Pembroke, share common ancestry but bear differenced arms.

A later member of the family, Sir William Finch, was knighted in 1513.
His son Sir Thomas Finch (died 1563), was also knighted for his share in suppressing Sir Thomas Wyatt&#x27;s insurrection against Queen Mary I, and was the son-in-law of Sir Thomas Moyle, some of whose lands Finch&#x27;s wife inherited.
Thomas&#x27;s eldest son Moyle Finch represented Weymouth, Kent and Winchelsea in the House of Commons.
In 1611 he was created a baronet, of Eastwell in the County of Kent.

In 1660 the 3rd Earl of Winchilsea was created Baron FitzHerbert of Eastwell, Kent, in recompense for his efficient aid in the Restoration of the Monarchy.

==History==
Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet of Eastwell, married Elizabeth Heneage, only daughter of Sir Thomas Heneage (1532–1595), Vice-Chamberlain of the Household to Queen Elizabeth I.
After Sir Moyle&#x27;s death in 1614, Elizabeth and her sons made considerable efforts to have the family&#x27;s status elevated.
On 8 July 1623, Elizabeth was raised to the Peerage of England as Viscountess Maidstone, and on 12 July 1628 she was further honoured when she was made Countess of Winchilsea.
Lady Winchilsea and Sir Moyle Finch&#x27;s youngest son, the Hon. Sir Heneage Finch, served as Speaker of the House of Commons and was the father of Heneage Finch, who was the Lord Chancellor of England and created Earl of Nottingham in 1681.

Sir Moyle Finch was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Theophilus, the 2nd Baronet (1573–1619).
He sat as Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth but died childless circa 1619.
He was succeeded by his younger brother Thomas, the 3rd Baronet.
He represented Winchelsea and Kent in the House of Commons.
In 1634, he also succeeded his mother as the second Earl of Winchilsea.

The third Earl, son of the second, supported the Restoration in 1660 and was thanked for his efforts the same year when he was created Baron FitzHerbert of Eastwell, in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England.

The third earl&#x27;s eldest son, William Finch, Viscount Maidstone, predeceased his father, but his son Charles succeeded as fourth Earl.
He served as President of the Board of Trade and as Lord Lieutenant of Kent.
His wife Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea, was a well-known poet.

The fourth Earl had no children and the titles passed to his uncle, Heneage Finch, 5th Earl of Winchilsea.
He had earlier represented Hythe in Parliament.

The fifth Earl was also childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, John Finch, 6th Earl of Winchilsea.
He never married, and on his death in 1729 the Barony of FitzHerbert of Eastwell became extinct.The remaining titles passed to his second cousin, Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, who became the 7th Earl of Winchilsea as well (see below for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was the eldest son of The Lord Chancellor of England, Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham.
He was a noted statesman and served as First Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Secretary of State for the Northern Department and as Lord President of the Council.

His son the 8th Earl of Winchilsea was also a politician and held office as First Lord of the Admiralty and as Lord President of the Council. 
The 8th Earl was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the 9th Earl, son of the Hon. William Finch, second son of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham.
The 9th Earl was Lord Lieutenant of Rutland for many years and was also an influential figure in the history of cricket.

The 9th Earl died unmarried and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the 10th Earl, son of George Finch-Hatton (1747–1823) (who had assumed the additional surname of Hatton), son of the Hon. Edward Finch, fifth son of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, and his wife the Hon. Anne Hatton, who was the daughter of Christopher Hatton, 1st Viscount Hatton (see the Viscount Hatton) and a relation of the famous Sir Christopher Hatton.
The 10th Earl is famous for his duel with the Duke of Wellington, who was Prime Minister at the time.
The duel, which was over the issue of Catholic emancipation and related to insulting remarks made by the Earl, took place at Battersea Fields on 21 March 1829.
Both men deliberately aimed wide and Winchilsea apologised.

His son the 11th Earl had represented Northamptonshire North in Parliament as a Tory.
He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his half-brother, the 12th Earl, who had sat briefly as Conservative Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire South and for Spalding.
He was succeeded by his younger brother, the 13th Earl. , the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the 17th Earl of Winchilsea and 12th Earl of Nottingham (the title having descended from father to son), who succeeded in 1999.

=== Other members ===
The Hon. Sir Heneage Finch was the third and youngest son of Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet and the Countess of Winchilsea. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons from 1625 to 1628. His son was Heneage Finch, later 1st Earl of Nottingham, was a prominent lawyer and politician and served as Lord Chancellor of England from 1675 to 1682.
He was created a baronet, of Raunston in the County of Buckingham, in the Baronetage of England in 1660 and in 1673 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Finch of Daventry in the County of Northampton.
In 1681, he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Nottingham, also in the Peerage of England.
He was succeeded by his son, Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, who in 1729 succeeded his second cousin as the 7th Earl of Winchilsea. See above for further history of the titles.

Several other members of the Finch family have also gained distinction. John Finch, 1st Baron Finch of Fordwich, was the son of Sir Henry Finch, younger brother of Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet of Eastwell. Later the Hon. Heneage Finch, younger brother of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, was made the 1st Earl of Aylesford in 1714.

The Hon. Edward Finch, the fifth son of the 1st Earl of Nottingham, was a composer and sat as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University.
He later took holy orders and served as Prebendary of York and Canterbury.
The Hon. Edward Finch-Hatton, fifth son of the 2nd Earl of Nottingham, sat as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University from 1727 to 1768. 

The Hon. Denys Finch Hatton, brother of the 14th Earl and nephew to Harold Heneage, moved to East Africa and became a noted pilot and hunter, and a close friend of writer Karen Blixen.
In the award winning film &quot;Out of Africa&quot; he was famously portrayed by Robert Redford opposite Meryl Streep. 

The Hon. Harold Heneage Finch-Hatton, fourth son of the 10th Earl, represented Newark in the House of Commons and later wrote books about Australia. The town of Finch Hatton, Queensland in Australia is believed to be named after him. 

The earldom of 1628 is sometimes written &quot;Winchelsea&quot;, after the modern spelling of the town (and Cinque Port) in East Sussex.

==Family seat and motto==
The ancestral family seat of Earls of Winchilsea was at Eastwell Park old manor house, until the last 6th Earl of Winchilsea died in 1729, then the title and estate was inherited by his second cousin, Daniel Finch, the 2nd Earl of Nottingham who also become 7th Earl of Winchilsea.The 7th Earl of Winchilsea and 2nd Earl of Nottingham had previously built the magnificent Burley on the Hill house during the 1690s, the new palatial residence was built as the seat of the Earls of Nottingham. The Earl chose Burley&#x27;s location to be nearer to his wife&#x27;s family (the Hattons) at Kirby Hall. Burley would served as the family seat until the unmarried 9th Earl of Winchilsea sought and obtained an act of Parliament to break the entail of the estate, and left Burley house to his illegitimate son, George Finch, rather than to his first cousin and his son the future 10th Earl.
Then Eastwell Park became the family seat again for George William Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea, 5th Earl of Nottingham. Eastwell Manor had previously been rebuilt in 1790s by Bonomi into a substantial residence for the 10th Earl&#x27;s parents, George Finch-Hatton esq and Lady Elizabeth Murray.
The Eastwell estate, near Ashford, Kent, was lived in by the Earls of Winchilsea until the mid-1860s, when the 11th Earl had to leave the property due to financial difficulties; it was later occupied by Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, the second son of Queen Victoria. It was sold in 1890s by the 12th Earl.

Haverholme Priory was an estate in Lincolnshire, inherited by the 10th Earl from his childless aunt and uncle in law, Sir Jenison Gordon. After the Eastwell estate was let go, Haverholme Priory became the family seat for the 12th Earl and 13th Earl of Winchilsea until it was eventually sold and demolished in 1920s.The Kirby Hall estate, near Corby, Northamptonshire was inherited by Edward Finch-Hatton, through his mother Anne Hatton, Countess of Winchilsea, sole heiress to Viscount Hatton, then went to his eldest son George Finch-Hatton esq, in turned went to his son the 10th Earl and so forth. The Hatton estate is still (2024) owned by the present Earl of Winchilsea, although the palatial hall – now partially de-roofed – is no longer lived in by the family.
Kirby hall itself and the adjacent gardens are today administered by English Heritage. 

The Finch family motto is &quot;Nil conscire sibi&quot; (&quot;Conscious of no evil&quot;), the Hatton motto is &quot;Virtus tutissima cassis&quot; (&quot;Virtue is the safest helmet&quot;).

<text>Media ecology theory is the study of media, technology, and communication and how they affect human environments. The theoretical concepts were proposed by Marshall McLuhan in 1964, while the term &quot;media ecology&quot; was first formally introduced by Neil Postman in 1968.

Ecology in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society. Neil Postman states, &quot;if in biology a &#x27;medium&#x27; is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is &#x27;a technology within which a [human] culture grows.&#x27;&quot; In other words, &quot;Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving.&quot;

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and communication technology is the primary cause of social change. McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, &quot;the medium is the message&quot;, which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself. McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of &quot;traffic&quot; between the two.

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at Cambridge University, a school which pioneered modern literary criticism. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, I.A. Richards, a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan&#x27;s later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards&#x27; approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication. Richards believed that &quot;words won&#x27;t stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous&quot;. This element of Richards&#x27; perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as &quot;The Global Village&quot; and &quot;The Medium Is the Message&quot;, two of his most well-known phrases that encapsulate the theory of media ecology. 

McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, William Empson, and Harold Innis as an &quot;entrée to the study of media&quot;. However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that &quot;if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their &#x27;content&#x27; but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV&quot;. This led to the emergence of his ideas on media ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day. He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie &quot;Annie Hall&quot;.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that media ecology received, due directly to McLuhan&#x27;s role as a pop culture icon. He was an excellent debater and public speaker, but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, Neil Postman founded the Program in Media Ecology at New York University in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers. &quot;Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments – like language itself, symbolic environments within which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways.&quot;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. &quot;I don&#x27;t see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context.&quot; Postman&#x27;s media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?

=== Walter Ong ===
Walter J. Ong was a scholar with a master&#x27;s degree in English who was once a student of McLuhan at the Saint Louis University. The contributions of Ong standardized and gave credibility to the field of media ecology as worthy of academic scholarship. Ong explored the changes in human thought and consciousness in the transition from a dominant oral culture to a literate one in his book &quot;Orality and Literacy&quot;.

Ong&#x27;s studies have greatly contributed to developing the concept of media ecology. Ong has written over 450 publications, many of which focused on the relation between conscious behavior and the evolution of the media, and he received the Media Ecology Association&#x27;s Walter Benjamin Award for Outstanding Article for his paper, &quot;Digitization Ancient and Modern: Beginnings of Writing and Today&#x27;s Computers&quot;.

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within media studies for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an interdisciplinary field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments. The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems. In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by Yuri Rozhdestvensky. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education. He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used &quot;because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter&quot;. Following theorists such as Felix Guattari, Gregory Bateson, and Manuel De Landa, the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as Matthew Fuller and Jussi Parikka) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan , Postman and Harold Innis, media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of Walter Ong, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Félix Guattari, Eric Havelock, Susanne Langer, Erving Goffman, Edward T. Hall, George Herbert Mead, Margaret Mead, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Benjamin Lee Whorf, and Gregory Bateson.

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan&#x27;s media history===

Marshall McLuhan defined media as anything requiring use of the human body. Under this definition, both computers and clothing can be identified as media. When a media is introduced it is adapted to human senses so that it becomes an extension of the individual, and its capabilities influence the whole of society, leading to change. McLuhan states that there are three inventions that transformed the world: the phonetic alphabet, by virtue of its ability to make speech visible, which McLuhan argues gave rise to the discipline of rhetoric in ancient time and to the study of language and poetics, which was also known as grammar. The printing press in the nineteenth century and the telegraph led to both the modern newspaper and also to journalism as an academic pursuit. The introduction of broadcasting in the form of radio, following on the heels of mass circulation newspapers, magazines, as well as the movies, resulted in the study of mass communication. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan splits history into four periods: the Tribal Age, the Literacy Age, the Print Age, and the Electronic Age.

McLuhan states that, in order to study media effectively, one must study not only content but also the whole cultural environment in which media thrives. He argues that using a detached view allows the individual to observe the phenomenon of the whole as it operates within the environment. The effects of media - speech, writing, printing, photograph, radio or television – should be studied within the social and cultural spheres impacted by this technology. McLuhan argues that all media, regardless of content, acts on the senses and reshapes sensory balance, further reshaping the society that created it. This differs from the viewpoints of scholars such as Neil Postman, who argue that society should take a moral view of new media whether good or bad. McLuhan further notes that media introduced in the past brought gradual changes, which allowed people and society some time to adjust.

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age. To McLuhan, this was a time of community, with the ear being the dominant sense organ. With everyone able to hear at the same time, listening to someone in a group was a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this set up, McLuhan argues, everything was more immediate, more present, and fostered more passion and spontaneity.

====Literacy age====

The second age McLuhan outlines is the Literacy Age, beginning with the invention of writing. To McLuhan, this was a time of private detachment, with the eye being the dominant sense organ. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to be read over and over again. Even though people would read the same words, the act of reading made communication an individual act, leading to more independent thought. Tribes didn&#x27;t need to come together to get information anymore.

====Print age====

The third stage McLuhan describes is the Print Age, when individual media products were mass-produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book, which allowed people to carry media so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from their immediate surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, McLuhan describes the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the information age, as an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse&#x27;s invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returns people to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. McLuhan argues that being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone&#x27;s business and everyone&#x27;s business is everyone else&#x27;s. This phenomenon is called the global village.

Later scholars have described the growth of open access and open science, with their potential for highly distributed and low cost publishing reaching much larger audiences, as a potential &quot;de-professionalizing force&quot;.

==== Updating the ages ====
Robert K. Logan is professor emeritus of physics at the University of Toronto and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the Ontario College of Art and Design. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic Homo sapiens)
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or &#x27;new media&#x27;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a &quot;participatory culture&quot;. Tom Valcanis argues that this is very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple&#x27;s iPhone. &quot;If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and &#x27;mash-up&#x27; culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a &#x27;participatory culture&#x27;...&quot;

===&#x27;The medium is the message&#x27;===

&quot;The medium is the message&quot; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, traditional media is an extension of the human body, while the new media is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society. The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That&#x27;s why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.

We are accustomed to thinking the message is separate from a medium. McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlooks the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. &quot;It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&quot; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses. Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed. With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The metaphor ====
The key elements to media ecology have been largely attributed to Marshall McLuhan, who coined the statement &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. Levinson furthers McLuhan&#x27;s statement by stating that &quot;the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society&quot;. McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to media ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring. As Carlos Scolari states, &quot;the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period. There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase &quot;the medium is the message&quot;. Author Niall Stephens argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of &quot;media ecology&quot;.

Scholar Janet Sternberg has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese &quot;yin/ yang&quot; metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions that can be distinguished in the field: the &quot;yang&quot; tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on intrapersonal communication and the &quot;yin&quot; tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While general systems theory originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of Ludwig von Bertalanffy. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as &quot;one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components&quot;.

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology &quot;cross pollinate each other&quot; in that, &quot;a general system is a medium&quot; due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are &quot;quasi-deterministic&quot;.

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, &quot;A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them.&quot;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase &quot;global village&quot; to characterize an end to isolation: &quot;humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous electronic media&quot;. McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; saying, &quot;Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence&quot;.

Technology, especially electronic media in today&#x27;s age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan&#x27;s day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long-distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today&#x27;s society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.

Of note is McLuhan&#x27;s insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one&#x27;s own community. Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of &#x27;Spaceship Earth&#x27; where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural; however, the original person to coin the term &#x27;Spaceship Earth&#x27; was futurist Buckminster Fuller, who once said, &quot;I&#x27;ve often heard people say: &#x27;I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,&#x27; and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That&#x27;s all we have experienced. We&#x27;re all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth.&quot;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize globalization within society. Michael Plugh writes, &quot;[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment.&quot;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, &quot;Where literate societies exchange an &#x27;eye for an ear,&#x27; according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or &#x27;global&#x27; level.&quot;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media. Hot media is high-definition communication that demands little involvement from the audience and concentrates on one sensory organ at a time. This type of media requires no interpretation because it gives all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. Cool media is media that demands active involvement from the audience, requiring the audience to be active and provide information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.

&quot;McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear.&quot;
* &quot;Eye&quot;: left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering
* &quot;Ear:&quot; right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns

===Laws of media===
Another aspect of media ecology is the &quot;laws of media,&quot; which McLuhan outlined with his son Eric McLuhan to further explain the influence of technology on society. The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples&#x27; critical thinking skills and to prepare people for &quot;the social and physical chaos&quot; that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.

The four effects, as depicted in the tetrad of media effects are:
* &quot;Enhancement&quot;: What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* &quot;Obsolescence&quot;: What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* &quot;Retrieval&quot;: What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* &quot;Reversal&quot;: What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, &quot;pushed to the limit of its potential,&quot; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. Determinism insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language (linguistic determinism), religion (theological determinism), financial (economic determinism). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man&#x27;s technological achievements they can be classified as technological determinism. According to Postman, &quot;The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information.&quot; Postman has also stated that &quot;a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture&#x27;s politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking&quot;.

Scholars such as Michael Zimmer view McLuhan and his &quot;Medium is the Message&quot; theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan&#x27;s (1964/1994) assertion 
that &quot;the medium is the message&quot;, the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias. 

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world &quot;by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important.&quot;

Lance Strate, on the other hand, argues that McLuhan&#x27;s theories are in no way deterministic. &quot;McLuhan never actually used the term, &quot;determinism,&quot; nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, &quot;The Medium is the Message&quot;, he wrote, &quot;there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening&quot; (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p. 25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan&#x27;s position with the quote, &quot;we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us&quot;, suggesting a transactional approach to media.&quot; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as &quot;soft determinism&quot; opposed to &quot;hard determinism&quot; with the difference being that &quot;hard determinism&quot; indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas &quot;soft determinism&quot; would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Peter-Paul Verbeek argued that technologies are &quot;inherently moral agents&quot; and their development is a &quot;moral enterprise&quot;.

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology. 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include &quot;any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media&quot;. Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and modality ====
Various scholars have examined media ecology theory from different perspectives to gain a better understanding of this theory in the 21st century. Sternberg used the yin/yang metaphor as their interpretation of the theory, while Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick, among others, introduce modality as a path to expand the media ecology theory. Contributing to a modern rhetoric for contextualizing media ecology in the era of the internet, social media, and technological advancements.

Hildebrand extends the concept of &#x27;mediated mobilities&#x27;, introduced by Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, to illustrate the similarities between the fields of media ecology and mobility research and propose a &quot;Modal Medium Theory&quot; as a combination of both studies. Both fields place an emphasis on the materiality and the structure that make up the environments media is accessed through. In the modern era, this includes not only the physical machines used for communication, but also the virtual environments messages are sent through and how they affect the quality of the message sent. They also explore the relations between an entity that is sent, the medium used for delivery, and how that medium can influence the environment. Entity can refer not only to subjects, but also objects, information, or situations that are shared. She looks into the article by Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states media ecology theory is &quot;the study of media environments, the idea that technology and techniques, modes of information and codes of communication play a leading role in human affairs&quot;. Hildebrand explained that Strate&#x27;s concept of media ecology extends beyond the study of information and communication technology to include technology in a broader sense . This includes materiality and mobility of media environments, interconnecting Media Ecology with Mobility Processes. Hildebrand points out that, &quot;[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate&quot;.

Similar to media ecology, mobilities research discusses a &quot;flow&quot; that shapes the environment, and creates contact zones. Dimmick furthers this explanation with the concept of interstices as the intersection of communication environments and issues of mobility. He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of &quot;nonspace&quot; or &quot;nonplace&quot; considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.

===The medium is not the message===

McLuhan&#x27;s critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really &quot;the medium is the message&quot; is a metaphor not an equation. His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an &quot;extension of man&quot; and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.

One of McLuhan&#x27;s high-profile critics was Umberto Eco. Eco comes from background in semiotics, which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan&#x27;s assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual&#x27;s interpretation can vary. Believing this to be true Eco says, &quot;It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it.&quot; In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan&#x27;s assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete and Neil Compton as meaningless or &quot;McLuhanacy&quot;. According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, &quot;it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions.&quot; Theorists such as Jonathan Miller claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan&#x27;s willingness to back away from a &quot;probe&quot; if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily. These theorists against McLuhan&#x27;s idea, such as Raymond Rosenthal, also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims: &quot;McLuhan&#x27;s books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology.&quot; Additionally, As Lance Strate said: &quot;Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a &quot;Great Divide&quot; theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

==Research ==

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current new media has a &quot;new&quot; stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of web 2.0. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, Tim O&#x27;Reilly. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about &#x27;the widespread sense that there&#x27;s something qualitatively different about today&#x27;s Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and &#x27;mash ups&#x27;. The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a participatory culture which proves Neil Postman&#x27;s saying &quot; is not additive; it is ecological&quot;.

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which &quot;portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation&quot;. Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers. So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and media literacy in its youth. As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television. The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today&#x27;s generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today&#x27;s new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is &quot;the world&#x27;s first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible.&quot; Second, &quot;there may actually be no unified ethos&quot;. With &quot;hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces&quot;.

===Education===
In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D&#x27;Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled &quot;How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs&quot;. The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested &quot;new media&quot; such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; media at today&#x27;s standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most &quot;valued&quot; method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

Transmedia Storytelling in Education as A Practice of Media Ecology

Further expanding Media Ecology Theory into modern-day communication. Anna A. Novikova analyzes recent transmedia storytelling strategies used in education through the perspective of media ecology. In &quot;Transmedia Storytelling in Education as a Practice of Media Ecology&quot;, Novikova highlights how advancements in technology and world events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased the need for media literacy and technological skills in adapting educational processes. She suggests that McLuhan&#x27;s concepts are reflected in how transmedial storytelling helps audiences broaden their worldviews and accepted norms. Transmedial stories developed from the input of an author and the input of students creates an environment based on connections among participants in the communication process, the participants&#x27; involvement and the conceptualization of traditional values, and the creation of new values. Novikova suggests the transmedia environment is an extension of McLuhan&#x27;s statement &quot;the medium is the message&quot; and the New Media Era. She acknowledges challenges this education strategy faces, such as the risk of presenting students with too much information, reducing retention and meaning by possibly presenting the information out of context.

<text>Adam Michnik (; born 17 October 1946) is a Polish historian, essayist, former dissident, public intellectual, as well as co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Polish newspaper, .

Reared in a family of committed communists, Michnik became an opponent of Poland&#x27;s communist regime at the time of the party&#x27;s anti-Jewish purges. He was imprisoned after the 1968 March Events and again after the imposition of martial law in 1981. He has been called &quot;one of Poland&#x27;s most famous political prisoners&quot;.

Michnik played a crucial role during the Polish Round Table Talks, as a result of which the communists agreed to call elections in 1989, which were won by Solidarity. Though he has withdrawn from active politics, he has &quot;maintained an influential voice through journalism&quot;. He has received many awards and honors, including the Legion of Honour and European of the Year. He is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders. In 2022, he received the Princess of Asturias Award in the category &quot;Communication and Humanities&quot;.

==Family==
Adam Michnik was born in Warsaw, Poland, to a family of communist activists of Jewish origin. His father Ozjasz Szechter was First Secretary of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, and his mother Helena Michnik was a historian, communist activist, and children&#x27;s-book author. His step-brother on his mother&#x27;s side, Stefan Michnik, was a military judge in the 1950s, who passed sentences, including executions, in politically motivated trials of members of Polish anti-Nazi resistance fighters. Stefan Michnik (who lived in Sweden from 1968 until his death in 2021), was later formally accused of &quot;zbrodnie komunistyczne&quot; (&quot;communist crimes&quot;) by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance.

A step-brother of Adam Michnik on his father&#x27;s side, Jerzy Michnik (born 1929), settled in Israel after 1957 and then moved to New York.

==Education==
While attending primary school, he was an active member of the Polish Scouting Association (ZHP), in a troop which was led by Jacek Kuroń. During secondary school, this particular Scouting troop was banned, and Adam began to participate in meetings of the Crooked Circle Club. After its closing in 1962, with the encouragement from Jan Józef Lipski and under Adam Schaff&#x27;s protection, he founded a discussion group, &quot;Contradiction Hunters Club&quot; (Klub Poszukiwaczy Sprzeczności); he was one and the most visible leader of the left wing student opposition group, the Komandosi.

In 1964, he began to study history at Warsaw University. A year later he was suspended because he disseminated an open letter to the members of Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) among his schoolmates. Its authors, Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski appealed for a beginning of reforms which would repair the political system in Poland. In 1965, the PZPR forbade the printing of his works. In 1966, he was suspended for the second time for organizing a discussion meeting with Leszek Kołakowski, who was expelled from the PZPR several weeks earlier, for criticizing its leaders. From then on, he wrote under a pseudonym to several newspapers including &quot;Życie Gospodarcze&quot;, &quot;Więź&quot;, and &quot;Literatura&quot;.

In March 1968, he was expelled from the university for his activities during 1968 Polish political crisis. The crisis was ignited by the ban of Kazimierz Dejmek&#x27;s adaptation of Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s poetic drama &quot;Dziady&quot; (&quot;Forefathers&#x27; Eve&quot;) in the National Theatre. The play contained many anti-Russian allusions, which were greeted with enthusiastic applause by the audience. Michnik and another student, Henryk Szlajfer, recounted the situation to a correspondent of &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;whose report was then carried on Radio Free Europe&quot;. Both Michnik and Szlajfer were expelled from the university. Upon their expulsion, students organized demonstrations, which were brutally suppressed by the riot police and &quot;worker-squads&quot;.

Władysław Gomułka used Michnik&#x27;s and several other dissidents&#x27; Jewish background to wage an anti-Semitic campaign, blaming the Jews for the crisis. Michnik was arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment for &quot;acts of hooliganism&quot;.

In 1969, he was released from prison under an amnesty, but he was forbidden to continue his studies. Not until the middle of the 1970s was he allowed to continue his studies of history, which he finished in 1975 at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, under the supervision of Prof. Lech Trzeciakowski.

==Opposition==

After he was released from prison, he worked for two years as a welder at the Róża Luxemburg&#x27;s (Rosa Luxemburg) Industrial Plant and then, on the recommendation of Jacek Kuroń, he became private secretary to Antoni Słonimski.

In 1976–77 he lived in Paris. After he returned to Poland, he became involved in the activity of Workers&#x27; Defence Committee (KOR), which had already existed for a couple of months. It was one of the best known opposition organizations of the 1970s. He became one of the most active opposition activists and also one of the supporters of the Society for Educational Courses (Towarzystwo Kursów Naukowych).

Between 1977 and 1989, he was the editor or co-editor of underground newspapers published illegally, samizdat: &quot;Biuletyn Informacyjny&quot;, &quot;Zapis&quot;, and &quot;Krytyka&quot;. He was also a member of the management of one of the biggest underground publishers: NOWa.

In years 1980–1989, he was an adviser to both the Independent Self-governing trade union &quot;Solidarity&quot; (NSZZ &quot;Solidarność&quot;) in the Mazovia Region and to Foundry Workers Committee of &quot;Solidarity&quot;.

When martial law was declared in December 1981, he was an internee at first, but when he refused to sign a &quot;loyalty oath&quot; and assent to voluntarily leave the country, he was jailed and accused of an &quot;attempt to overthrow socialism&quot;. He was in jail without a verdict until 1984 because the prosecutor&#x27;s office deliberately prolonged the trial.

Adam Michnik demanded an end to the judicial proceedings against him or have his case dismissed. Meanwhile, he wanted to be granted the status of a political prisoner and began a hunger strike while in jail. In 1984, he was released from jail, under an amnesty.

He took part in an attempt to organize a strike in the Gdańsk shipyard. As a consequence, he was rearrested in 1985 and this time sentenced to three years imprisonment. He was released the following year, again under another amnesty.

==Since 1989==
In 1988, he became an adviser of Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s informal Coordination Committee, and later he became a member of the Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee. He took an active part in planning and preliminary negotiations for the Round Table Talks in 1989, in which he also participated. Adam Michnik inspired and collaborated with the editors of the &quot;Ulam Quarterly&quot;, before 1989 that journal pioneered the World Wide Web in the USA.

After the Round Table Talks, Lech Wałęsa told him to organize a big Polish national daily, which was supposed to be an &#x27;organ&#x27; of the Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee, before the upcoming elections. This newspaper, under the Round Table agreement, was (&quot;Election Newspaper&quot;) because it was supposed to appear until the end of the parliamentary election in 1989. After organizing this newspaper with journalists who worked in the &quot;Biuletyn Informacyjny&quot;, Adam Michnik became its editor-in-chief.

In the elections to the Contract Sejm on 4 June 1989 he became a member of parliament for Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee electoral register, as a candidate for the city of Bytom.

Both as a member of parliament and as editor of he actively supported Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki&#x27;s government and his candidature in the 1990 presidential election campaign against Lech Wałęsa. After the breakup of the Citizens&#x27; Committee and Mazowiecki&#x27;s failure, Michnik withdrew from his direct involvement in politics and did not run for a seat in the 1991 parliamentary election, instead focusing on editorial and journalistic activities. Under his leadership, was converted into an influential liberal daily newspaper in Poland. Based on assets, the Agora SA partnership came into existence. By May 2004, it was one of the biggest media concerns in Poland, administrating 11 monthly titles, the portal gazeta.pl, the outdoor advertising company AMS, and has shares in several radio stations. Adam Michnik does not have any shares in Agora and does not hold any office, other than chief editor, which is unusual in business in Poland. Michnik&#x27;s shares are kept by Agora.

Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki in his exposé in September 1989 began a new, so-called &quot;thick line&quot;attitude to the political history of the recent past. Michnik is a proponent and advocate of this policy.

On 27 December 2002, Adam Michnik and Paweł Smoleński revealed the so-called &quot;Rywin affair&quot; which had to be explained by a specially called parliamentary select committee.

In autumn 2004, due to health problems (he suffered from tuberculosis) he resigned from active participation in editing and passed his duties to editorial colleague Helena Łuczywo.

He is a member of the Association of Polish Writers and the Council on Foreign Relations.

Since the conservative Law and Justice party led by Jarosław Kaczyński gained power in Poland in 2015, Michnik has been a vocal critic of the new government accusing it of undermining democracy in the country stating that &quot;What we are seeing today is a gradual closing down of democracy. There is no other democracy than the liberal version. Everything else is a contradiction in terms.&quot;

In 2024, he became an expert at the &quot;European Center for Analysis and Strategies&quot; (CASE).[45]

==Quotations==
According to Canadian translator and writer Paul Wilson, Adam Michnik &quot;[holds a] core... belief... that history is not just about the past because it is constantly recurring, and not as farce, as Marx had it, but as itself:

<text>The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is a quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization in the United States founded in 1983 with the stated aim of advancing democracy worldwide and counter communist influence abroad, by promoting political and economic institutions, such as political groups, business groups, trade unions, and free markets.

The NED was created as a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation, but acts as a grant-making foundation. It is funded primarily by an annual allocation from the U.S. Congress. In addition to its grants program, the NED also supports and houses the &quot;Journal of Democracy&quot;, the World Movement for Democracy, the International Forum for Democratic Studies, the Reagan–Fascell Fellowship Program, the Network of Democracy Research Institutes, and the Center for International Media Assistance.

Upon its founding, the NED assumed several former activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. Political groups, activists, academics, and some governments have accused the NED of being an instrument of U.S. foreign policy helping to foster regime change. In February 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency cut funding to the NED by blocking disbursement from the US Department of Treasury after Elon Musk, who has been carrying out President Donald Trump&#x27;s cost-cutting agenda, called for NED to be shut down.

==History==

===Founding===
The National Security Decision Directive 77 was instrumental for the creation of Project Democracy and its offspring NED.

In a 1982 speech at the Palace of Westminster, President Ronald Reagan proposed an initiative, before the British Parliament, &quot;to foster the infrastructure of democracy – the system of a free press, unions, political parties, universities.&quot; This intersected with previously formulated plans by the American Political Foundation, an NGO supported by some members of the Republican and Democratic parties, together with scholars based at CSIS, to create a government-funded but privately run democracy promotion foundation to support democratic civil society groups and parties. The idea was strongly championed by the State Department, which argued that a non-governmental foundation would be able to support dissident groups and organizations in the Soviet Bloc, and also foster the emergence of democratic movements in US-allied dictatorships that were becoming unstable and in danger of experiencing leftist or radical revolutions, without provoking a diplomatic backlash against the US government. After some initial uncertainty over the idea from Reagan Administration hard-liners, the U.S. government, through USAID (United States Agency for International Development), contracted &quot;The American Political Foundation&quot; to study democracy promotion, which became known as &quot;The Democracy Program&quot;. The Program recommended the creation of a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation to be known as the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). NED, though non-governmental, would be funded primarily through annual appropriations from the U.S. government and subject to congressional oversight.

In 1983, the House Foreign Affairs Committee proposed legislation to provide initial funding of $31.3 million for NED as part of the &quot;State Department Authorization Act&quot; (H.R. 2915), because NED was in its beginning stages of development the appropriation was set at $18 million. Included in the legislation was $13.8 million for the Free Trade Union Institute, an affiliate of the AFL–CIO, $2.5 million for an affiliate of the National Chamber Foundation, and $5 million each for two party institutes, which was later eliminated by a vote of 267–136. The conference report on H.R. 2915 was adopted by the House on November 17, 1983, and the Senate the following day. On November 18, 1983, articles of incorporation were filed in the District of Columbia to establish the National Endowment for Democracy as a nonprofit organization.

===1980s to present===
An analysis by political scientist Sarah Bush found that while NED activity in the 1980s focused on direct challenges to autocrats by funding dissidents, opposition parties, and unions, the majority of 21st-century NED funding goes to technical programs that are less likely to challenge the status quo, with the proportion of NED funding for &quot;relatively tame programs&quot; increasing from roughly 20% of NED grants in 1986 to roughly 60% in 2009. Political scientist Lindsey A. O&#x27;Rourke writes that, &quot;Today, NED programs run in more than ninety countries. Although the number of US-backed democracy promotion programs have grown, most of today&#x27;s programs pursue less aggressive objectives than their Cold War counterparts.&quot;
In a 1991 interview with the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, NED founder Allen Weinstein said: &quot;A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.&quot;

During the 1984 Panamanian general election the American Institute for Free Labor Development and the NED provided around $20,000 in support of activists involved with Ardito Barletta&#x27;s campaign.

The NED was active in Yugoslavia before its dissolution. It arranged meetings between Yugoslav dissidents and members of the US Congress, US government officials, and members of the media. It also gave funds to Freedom House which were used to fund the Yugoslav opposition.

Since 2004, NED has granted US$8,758,300 to Uyghur groups including the World Uyghur Congress, the Uyghur Human Rights Project, the Campaign for Uyghurs and &quot;The Uyghur Transitional Justice Database Project&quot;. It has also provided extensive grants for programs pertaining to Tibet.
Between 2005 and 2012 it gave grants to the &quot;China Free Press&quot; NGO and in 2019 it gave about $643,000 to civil society programmes in Hong Kong. In response, in 2020 China imposed sanctions on NED president Carl Gershman and Michael Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House.

The NED played a role in supporting the Arab Spring of 2011. For example, the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights and individual Yemeni activist Entsar Qadhi received training and finances from the NED. In Egypt, between 2008 and 2012, it also supported Colonel Omar Afifi Soliman, an exiled police officer who opposed both Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s and Mohamed Morsi&#x27;s presidencies, as well as secularist activist Esraa Abdel-Fatah&#x27;s &quot;Egyptian Democratic Academy&quot; in 2011.

==== Second Trump administration ====
In 2025, Elon Musk criticized the NED as &quot;rife with corruption&quot; and guilty of &quot;crimes&quot;, later calling it an &quot;evil organization needs to be dissolved&quot;. He also wrote &quot;NED is a SCAM.&quot; In February 2025, Musk&#x27;s Department of Government Efficiency cut funding to the NED by blocking disbursement from the US Department of Treasury, causing significant disruptions to the organization. &quot;The Free Press&quot; believes that dismantling the NED would symbolise a momentous change in US foreign policy, undermining the idea that democratic ideals foster US global strength and influence, and that the Trump administration therefore no longer believes that promoting democracy in the world is in the national interest. On February 12, the NED informed the organizations it funds that it would suspend payments immediately. Additionally, organizations supported by NED started laying off staff and cutting expenditures.

==Funding and structure==
NED is a grant-making foundation, distributing funds to private non-governmental organizations for promoting democracy abroad in around 90 countries. Half of NED&#x27;s funding is allocated annually to four main U.S. organizations: the American Center for International Labor Solidarity (associated with the AFL–CIO), the &quot;Center for International Private Enterprise&quot; (affiliated with the USCC), the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (associated with the Democratic Party), and the International Republican Institute (formerly known as the National Republican Institute for International Affairs and affiliated with the Republican Party). The other half of NED&#x27;s funding is awarded annually to hundreds of non-governmental organizations based abroad which apply for support. In 2011, the Democratic and Republican Institutes channeled around $100 million through the NED.

===Source of funding===
The NED receives an annual appropriation from the U.S. budget (it is included in the chapter of the Department of State budget destined for the U.S. Agency for International Development-USAID) and is subject to congressional oversight even as a non-governmental organization.

From 1984 to 1990 the NED received $15–18 million of congressional funding annually, and $25–30 million from 1991 to 1993. At the time the funding came via the United States Information Agency. In 1993 the NED nearly lost its congressional funding, after the House of Representatives initially voted to abolish its funding. The funding (of $35 million, a rise from $30 million the year before) was only retained after a vigorous campaign by NED supporters.

In the financial year to the end of September 2009 NED had an income of $135.5 million, nearly all of which came from U.S. Government agencies. In addition to government funding, the NED has received funding from foundations, such as the Smith Richardson Foundation, the John M. Olin Foundation, and others. The Bradley Foundation supported the &quot;Journal of Democracy&quot; with $1.5 million during 1990–2008.

In 2018, President Donald Trump proposed to slash the NED&#x27;s funding and cut its links to the Democratic and Republican Institutes.

==Center for International Media Assistance (CIMA)==
In 2006, CIMA was founded as an initiative of the National Endowment for Democracy with encouragement from Congress and a grant from the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. CIMA promotes the work of independent media and journalists abroad, with a focus on the developing world, social media, digital media, and citizen journalism. It issued its first report, &quot;Empowering Independent Media: U.S. Efforts to Foster Free and Independent Media Around the World&quot;, in 2008, and subsequently issued other reports, including a report on digital media in conflict-prone societies and a report on mobile phone use in Africa.

== Reception ==
Writing in &quot;Slate&quot; in 2004, Brendan I. Koerner wrote that, &quot;Depending on whom you ask, the NED is either a nonprofit champion of liberty or an ideologically driven meddler in world affairs.&quot;

NED has been criticized by both the right and the left. Some on the right accuse the NED of having a pro-social democracy agenda, promoted through its labor affiliate; conversely, some on the left accuse the NED of being &quot;a rightwing initiative&quot; oriented toward Reagan&#x27;s Cold War politics. Within Latin America, critics accuse the NED of manifesting U.S. paternalism or imperialism, conversely, &quot;supporters say that it helps many groups with a social-democratic and liberal orientation across the world,&quot; providing training and support for pro-democracy groups that criticize the U.S. In a 2004 article for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Michael McFaul argues that the NED is not an instrument of U.S. foreign policy. He said he experienced the difference between the actions of US policymakers and the actions of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) while representing the NDI in Moscow during the last days of the Soviet Union: U.S. policymakers supported Mikhail Gorbachev while the NDI worked with Democratic Russia, Gorbachev&#x27;s opponents. NED has said in public statements that democracy evolves &quot;according to the needs and traditions of diverse political cultures&quot; and does not necessitate an American-style model.

In 1986, NED&#x27;s President Carl Gershman said that the NED was created because &quot;It would be terrible for democratic groups around the world to be seen as subsidized by the CIA. We saw that in the 1960s and that&#x27;s why it has been discontinued&quot;. Throughout the course of a 2010 investigation by ProPublica, Paul Steiger, the then editor in chief of the publication said that &quot;those who spearheaded creation of NED have long acknowledged it was part of an effort to move from covert to overt efforts to foster democracy&quot; and cited as evidence a 1991 interview in which then-NED president Allen Weinstein said, &quot;A lot of what we do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA.&quot;

Critics have compared the NED&#x27;s funding of Nicaraguan groups (pro-U.S. and conservative unions, political parties, student groups, business groups, and women&#x27;s associations) in the 1980s and 1990s in Nicaragua to the previous CIA effort &quot;to challenge and undermine&quot; a left-wing government in Chile. (Latin Americanist scholar William M. LeoGrande writes that the NED&#x27;s roughly $2 million funding into Nicaragua between 1984 and 1988 was the &quot;main source of overt assistance to the civic opposition,&quot; of which about half went to the anti-Sandinista newspaper &quot;La Prensa&quot;.) According to sociologist William Robinson, NED funds during the Reagan years were &quot;ultimately used for five overlapping pseudo-covert activities: leadership training for pro-American elites, promotion of pro-American educational systems and mass media, strengthening the &#x27;institutions of democracy&#x27; by funding pro-American organizations in the target state, propaganda, and the development of transnational elite networks.&quot; Criticizing these activities, Robinson wrote that &quot;U.S. policymakers claim that they are interested in process (free and fair elections) and not outcome (the results of these elections); in reality, the principal concern is outcome.&quot;

Political scientist Lindsey A. O&#x27;Rourke writes that the Reagan-era NED played a key role in U.S. efforts &quot;to promote democratic transitions in Chile, Haiti, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, and Suriname,&quot; but did so to promote the success of pro-U.S. parties, not just to promote democracy, and did not support communist or socialist opposition parties. The North American Congress on Latin America says that the NED engages in a &quot;a very particular form of low-intensity democracy chained to pro-market economics--in countries from Nicaragua to the Philippines, Ukraine to Haiti, overturning unfriendly &#x27;authoritarian&#x27; governments (many of which the United States had previously supported) and replacing them with handpicked pro-market allies.&quot;

=== Thailand and Malaysia ===
In the 2020 Thai protests, pro-government groups cited NED support for protester-sympathizing groups to assert that the US government was masterminding the protests. The United States Embassy in Bangkok formally denied allegations of funding or supporting protesters.

In August 2021, Malaysian human rights activist and Suaram adviser Kua Kia Soong criticized the opposition coalition Pakatan Harapan for accepting funding from the National Endowment of Democracy, which he described as a &quot;CIA soft power front&quot;. Citing the US track record of supporting regime change abroad and racial discrimination against Black and Asian Americans, Kua urged Malaysian civil society organizations to stop accepting funding from the NED since it undermined their legitimacy, independence, and effectiveness. Kua&#x27;s statement came after Daniel Twining, the president of the NED affiliate International Republican Institute, had made remarks in 2018 acknowledging that the NED had financially supported Malaysian opposition parties and NGOs, including Suaram since 2002 (Kua said that Suaram no longer accepts funds from NED upon realizing about the nature of NED). Following the 2018 Malaysian general election Twining had also praised the newly elected Pakatan Harapan government for freezing Chinese infrastructural investments.

===Reaction from foreign governments===
====Russia====
Russian government officials and state media have frequently regarded the NED as hostile to their country. In 2015, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti blamed NED grants for the Euromaidan mass protests that forced Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych from power. In July 2015, the Russian government declared NED to be an &quot;undesirable&quot; NGO, making the NED the first organization banned under the Russian undesirable organizations law signed two months earlier by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

====China====
During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, a Chinese newspaper accused the US of using the NED to fund pro-democracy protesters. Michael Pillsbury, a Hudson Institute foreign policy analyst and former Reagan administration official, stated that the accusation was &quot;not totally false&quot;. In 2019, the Chinese government sanctioned the NED in response to the passage by the U.S. Congress of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The Chinese government stated that the NED and CIA worked in tandem to covertly foment the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, and that NED acted as a U.S. intelligence front. NED was one of several U.S.-based NGOs sanctioned by the Chinese government; others included the Human Rights Watch, Freedom House, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute. China also already tightly restricted the activities of foreign NGOs in China, particularly since 2016, and the NGOs sanctioned by China typically do not have offices on the mainland; as a result, the sanctions were regarded as mostly symbolic. NED grant recipients in Hong Kong included labor advocacy and human rights groups such as the Solidarity Center and Justice Centre Hong Kong. The Chinese government said that the sanctioned organizations were &quot;anti-China&quot; forces that &quot;incite separatist activities for Hong Kong independence&quot;; a U.S. State Department official said that &quot;false accusations of foreign interference&quot; against U.S.-based NGOs were &quot;intended to distract from the legitimate concerns of Hongkongers.&quot; NED has denied it provided aid to protestors in 2019.

In August 2020, the Chinese government sanctioned NED chairman Carl Gershman, together with the heads of four other U.S.-based democracy and human rights organizations and six U.S. Republican lawmakers for supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement in the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. The unspecified sanctions were a tit-for-tat measure responding to the earlier sanctioning by the U.S. of 11 Hong Kong officials in response to the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law in June 2020.

In December 2020 China sanctioned the senior director of the NED, John Knaus, saying he &quot;blatantly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and grossly interferes in China&#x27;s domestic affairs&quot;.

In May 2022, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused NED of funding separatists to undermine the stability of target countries, instigating color revolutions to subvert state power, and meddling in other countries&#x27; politics.

====Other reactions====
Other governments that have objected to NED activity include Iran, Egypt, India, and Venezuela.

<text>A censer, incense burner, perfume burner or pastille burner is a vessel made for burning incense or perfume in some solid form. They vary greatly in size, form, and material of construction, and have been in use since ancient times throughout the world. They may consist of simple earthenware bowls or fire pots to intricately carved silver or gold vessels, small table top objects a few centimetres tall to as many as several metres high. Many designs use openwork to allow a flow of air. In many cultures, burning incense has spiritual and religious connotations, and this influences the design and decoration of the censer.

Often, especially in Western contexts, the term &quot;censer&quot; is used for pieces made for religious use, especially those on chains that are swung through the air to spread the incense smoke widely, while the term &quot;perfume burner&quot; is used for objects made for secular use. The original meaning of pastille was a small compressed mixture of aromatic plant material and charcoal that was lit to release the odour, and pastille-burners were designed for this, for use in the home. Pastilles were made at home until their heyday in the early 19th century, and the burners are often made in pottery or porcelain.

Some types could also be used as pomanders, where the perfume diffuses slowly by evaporation rather than burning.

==Use==

For direct-burning incense, pieces of the incense are burned by placing them directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible.

Indirect-burning incense, also called &quot;non-combustible incense&quot;, is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form, leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion. The use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions. This incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material. Finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly, while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area. The heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers.

For home use of granulated incense, small, concave charcoal briquettes are sold. One lights the corner of the briquette on fire, then places it in the censer and extinguishes the flame. After the glowing sparks traverse the entire briquette, it is ready to have incense placed on it.

For direct-burning incense, the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end. Flames on the incense are then fanned or blown out, with the incense continuing to burn without a flame on its own.

Censers made for stick incense are also available; these are simply a long, thin plate of wood, metal, or ceramic, bent up and perforated at one end to hold the incense. They serve to catch the ash of the burning incense stick.

In Taoist and Buddhist temples, the inner spaces are scented with thick coiled incense, which are either hung from the ceiling or on special stands. Worshipers at the temples light and burn sticks of incense. Individual sticks of incense are then vertically placed into individual censers.

==Chinese use==

The earliest vessels identified as censers date to the mid-fifth to late fourth centuries BCE during the Warring States period. The modern Chinese term for &quot;censer,&quot; &quot;xianglu&quot; (爐, &quot;incense burner&quot;), is a compound of &quot;xiang&quot; (&quot;incense, aromatics&quot;) and &quot;lu&quot; (, &quot;brazier; stove; furnace&quot;). Another common term is &quot;xunlu&quot; (爐, &quot;a brazier for fumigating and perfuming&quot;). Early Chinese censer designs, often crafted as a round, single-footed stemmed basin, are believed to have derived from earlier ritual bronzes, such as the &quot;dou&quot; 豆 sacrificial chalice.

Among the most celebrated early incense burner designs is the hill censer (&quot;boshanlu&quot; 博山爐), a form that became popular during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE). Some scholars believe hill censers depict a sacred mountain, such as Mount Kunlun or Mount Penglai. These elaborate vessels were designed with apertures that made rising incense smoke appear like clouds or mist swirling around a mountain peak. The Han dynasty scholar Liu Xiang (77–6 BCE) composed an inscription describing a hill censer:
&quot;I value this perfect utensil, lofty and steep as a mountain! Its top is like Hua Shan in yet its foot is a bronze plate. It contains rare perfumes, red flames and green smoke; densely ornamented are its sides, and its summit joins azure heaven. A myriad animals are depicted on it. Ah, from it sides I can see ever further than Li Lou&quot; [who had legendary eyesight].

Another popular design was the small &quot;scenting globe&quot; (&quot;xiangqiu&quot; 香球), a device similar to a pomander, but used for burning incense. The famed inventor and craftsmen, Ding Huan (1st c. BCE), is believed to have made these with gimbal supports so the censer could easily be used to fumigate or scent garments. This is described by Edward H. Schafer:
&quot;Censing baskets&quot; were globes of hollow metal, pierced with intricate floral or animal designs; within the globe, an iron cup, suspended on gimbals, contained the burning incense. They were used to perfume garments and bedclothes, and even to kill insects.
Other Chinese censers are shaped like birds or animals, sometimes designed so that the incense smoke would issue from the mouth. During the medieval period when censers were more commonly used in Buddhist and Daoist rituals&quot;,&quot; hand-held censers (&quot;shoulu&quot; 爐) fashioned with long handles were developed.

Archeologists have excavated several censers from Han era tombs that contained aromatics or ashen remains. Some of these aromatic plants have been identified as &quot;maoxiang&quot; (茅香 &quot;Imperata cylindrica, thatch grass&quot;), &quot;gaoliangjiang&quot; (高良薑 &quot;Galangal&quot;), &quot;xinyi&quot; (辛夷 &quot;Magnolia liliiflora, Mulan magnolia), and &quot;gaoben&quot; (藁本&quot;Ligusticum sinense, Chinese lovage&quot;). Scholars speculate burning these grasses &quot;may have facilitated communication with spirits&quot; during funeral ceremonies.

According to the Sinologist and historian Joseph Needham, some early Daoists adapted censers for the religious and spiritual use of cannabis. The Daoist encyclopedia &quot;Wushang Biyao&quot; (無上秘要 &quot;Supreme Secret Essentials&quot;, ca. 570 CE), recorded adding cannabis into ritual censers. The Shangqing School of Daoism provides a good example. The Shangqing scriptures were written by Yang Xi (330– ) during alleged visitations by Daoist &quot;immortals&quot;, and Needham believed Yang was &quot;aided almost certainly by cannabis&quot;. Tao Hongjing (456-536 CE), who edited the official Shangqing canon, also compiled the &quot;Mingyi bielu&quot; (名醫別錄 &quot;Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians&quot;). It noted that &quot;mabo&quot; (麻勃 &quot;cannabis flowers&quot;), &quot;are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians ([&quot;shujia&quot;] 術家) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.&quot; Needham concluded,
Thus all in all there is much reason for thinking that the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with hallucinogenic smokes, using techniques which arose directly out of liturgical observance. … At all events the incense-burner remained the centre of changes and transformations associated with worship, sacrifice, ascending perfume of sweet savour, fire, combustion, disintegration, transformation, vision, communication with spiritual beings, and assurances of immortality. &quot;Wai tan&quot; and &quot;nei tan&quot; met around the incense-burner. Might one not indeed think of it as their point of origin?
These &quot;Waidan&quot; (外丹 &quot;outer alchemy&quot;) and &quot;neidan&quot; (內丹 &quot;inner alchemy&quot;) are the primary divisions of Chinese alchemy.

During the T’ang period, incense was used by upper-class people for personal hygiene, romantic rendezvous, and deodorizing the interior of edifices. These included places of worship, dwellings, and work-spaces. Dating back to the seventh century AD, the &quot;kuanhuo&quot; (changing of fire) ceremony took place, where people would cleanse their homes with incense. However, in some parts of East Asia, incense burners were used as a way to tell time

In the Far East, incense was used as a way to tell time because it was a simple mechanism and generally not a fire hazard. Time increments were marked off on each incense stick to show how much time had passed, then placed in a ritual tripod vessel known as a &quot;ting&quot;. During imperial coronations, incense sticks would be used to tell how long the ceremony was. Other variations of incense is the spiral incense coil. The spiral incense coil was used to measure time for longer durations. One spiral equated to one night. This type of incense was mainly used by the five ‘night watches’ of the community. The length of their shifts and breaks were determined by the time increments marked off on the spirals.

Tiangong censers are used for religious reasons in China

==Middle East==


Incense burners (miqtarah in Arabic) were used in both religious and secular contexts, but were more widely utilized in palaces and houses. The earliest known examples of dish-shaped incense burners with zoomorphic designs were excavated in Ghanza, while the earliest examples of zoomorphic incense burners are from 11th-century Tajikistan. It is most likely that this practice was inspired by Hellenistic style incense burners as well as the frankincense trade present in the Arabian peninsula since the 8th century BCE.  

A wide variety of designs were used at different times and in different areas. Pottery and stone incense burners were the most common while those made of metals were reserved for the wealthy. Artisans created these incense burners with moulds or the lost-wax method. Openwork zoomorphic incense burners with lynx or lion designs were popular in the Islamic world; bronze or brass examples are found from the 11th century until the Mongol conquests of the 13th century. These were especially popular during the Seljuq period. The extensive use of lynx shape incense burners was due to the animals popularity as a hunting animal and as pet in Muslim courts. The complexity of the piece would also make it fit into a palatial setting. This style of incense burners could measure about 22 cm; others like an example in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York measures 85 cm. The surface of the object would be decorated with bands of Arabic calligraphy which would imitate a tiraz. This bands of text could include the name of the artist and the patron as well as prayers and good wishes for the owner. To insert coals and incense the head would be removed; the openwork geometric design would then allow the scented smoke to escape. Depending on the size, the incense burner could be either carried on a tray or carried by using the tail as a handle.

In mosques, incense burners do not have a liturgical use or a specific design denoted for religious context. However, they are still an important part of rituals and weddings. Other religious groups in Middle East such as the Copts and Syriacs do have ceremonial uses for incense burners.   

==Japan==

Koro (Japanese: 香炉, &quot;kōro&quot;), also a Chinese term, is a Japanese censer often used in Japanese tea ceremonies.

Examples are usually of globular form with three feet, made in pottery, Imari porcelain, Kutani ware, Kakiemon, Satsuma, enamel or bronze.
In Japan a similar censer called a is used by several Buddhist sects. The egōro is usually made of brass with a long handle and no chain. Instead of charcoal, makkō powder is poured into a depression made in a bed of ash. The makkō is lit and the incense mixture is burned on top. This method is known as Sonae-kō (Religious Burning).

==Mesoamerica==

Used domestically and ceremonially in Mesoamerica, particularly in the large Central-Mexican city of Teotihuacan (100–600 AD) and in the many kingdoms belonging to the Maya civilization, were ceramic incense burners. The most common materials for construction were Adobe, plumbate, and earthenware. These materials can be dried by the sun and were locally sourced, making them the perfect material for a Mayan craftsman. Censers vary in decoration. Some are painted using a fresco style technique or decorated with &quot;adornos&quot;, or small ceramic ornaments. These decorations usually depicted shells, beads, butterflies, flowers, and other symbols with religious significance that could to increase rainfall, agricultural abundance, fertility, wealth, good fortune or ease the transition of souls into the underworld. To identify precious materials such as jadeite and quetzal feathers, important visual markers of status, artists used colorful paints.

Used to communicate with the gods, these censers functioned for acts of religious purification. Incense would be presented to the divine being. In fact, some people were appointed the position of fire priest. Fire priests dealt with most tasks related to incense burning. Some rituals involved a feast, which would be followed by the fire priest igniting a sacred brazier in the temples. It was given to the divine beings and deities as offerings on a daily basis. The practice would end at the sound of a trumpet made from a conch shell. Another function of incense was to heal the sick. Once recuperated, the diseased would present some incense to the appropriate gods to repay them for being cured. Made up of copal (tree resin), rubber, pine, herbs, myrrh, and chewing gum, the incense produced what was described as &quot;the odor of the center of heaven.&quot;

The shape of incense burners in the Maya southern lowlands reflected religious and cultural changes over time. Some censers were used in funerals and funerary rituals, such as those depicting the Underworld Jaguar or the Night Sun God. When a king would die, ‘termination rituals’ were practiced. During these rituals, &quot;incensarios&quot; would be smashed and older temples were replaced with new ones. Mayan censers, which had a reservoir for incense on top of a vertical shaft were highly elaborate during the Classic period (600–900 AD), particularly in the kingdom of Palenque, and usually show the head of a Mayan deity. In Post-Classic Yucatán, particularly in the capital of the kingdom of Mayapan, censers were found in great numbers, often shaped as an aged priest or deity. Craftsmen produced Mayan censers in many sizes, some just a few inches in height, others, several feet tall.

==Christian use==
===Eastern churches===

====Chain censer====
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, as well as the Eastern Catholic Churches, censers (Greek: &quot;thymiateria&quot;) are similar in design to the Western thurible. This fourth chain passes through a hole the hasp and slides in order to easily raise the lid. There will often be 12 small bells attached to the chains, symbolising the preaching of the Twelve Apostles, where one of the bells has been silenced to symbolize the rebel Judas. In some traditions the censer with bells is normally used only by a bishop. Before a deacon begins a censing, he will take the censer to the priest (or the bishop, if he is present) for a blessing. The censers, charcoal and incense are kept in the diaconicon (sacristy) Entrance with the censer at Great Vespers.

The censer is used much more frequently in the Eastern churches: typically at every vespers, matins, and Divine Liturgy, as well as pannikhidas (memorial services), and other occasional offices. If a deacon is present, he typically does much of the &quot;censing;&quot; otherwise, the priest will perform the censing. Unordained servers or acolytes are permitted to prepare and carry the censer, but may not swing it during prayers. Liturgical &quot;Censing&quot; is the practice of swinging a censer suspended from chains towards something or someone, typically the Holy Eucharist, an icon or person, so that smoke from the burning incense travels in that direction. Burning incense represents the prayers of the church rising towards Heaven. One commonly sung psalm during the censing is &quot;Let my prayer arise in Thy sight as incense, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.&quot; When a deacon or priest performs a full censing of the temple (church building), he will often say Psalm 51 quietly to himself.

====Hand censer====

In addition to the chain censer described above, a &quot;hand censer&quot; (Greek: Κατσί &quot;katzi or katzion&quot;) is used on certain occasions. This device has no chains and consists of a bowl attached to a handle, often with bells attached. The lid is normally attached to the bowl with a hinge.

In Greek practice, particularly as observed on Mount Athos, during the portion of Vespers known as &quot;Lord, I cry unto Thee&quot; the ecclesiarch (sacristan) and his assistant will perform a full censing of the temple and people using hand censers.

Some churches have the practice of not using the chain censer during Holy Week, even by a priest or bishop, substituting for it the hand censer as a sign of humility, repentance and mourning over the Passion of Christ. They return to using the chain censer just before the Gospel reading at the Divine Liturgy on Great Saturday.

Some Orthodox Christians use a standing censer on their icon corner (home altar).

===Western churches===

In the Latin Church and its Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church and some other groups, the censer is often called a &quot;thurible&quot;, and used during important offices (benedictions, processions, and important Masses). A common design for a thurible is a metal container, about the size and shape of a coffee-pot, suspended on chains. The bowl contains hot coals, and the incense is placed on top of these. The thurible is then swung back and forth on its chains, spreading the fragrant smoke.

A famous thurible is the &quot;Botafumeiro&quot;, in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Suspended from the ceiling of the cathedral, the swinging of this high, 55 kilogram silver vessel is an impressive sight.

One of the explanations for the great size of the Botafumeiro is that in the early days it was used to freshen the air in the cathedral after being visited by droves of travel-weary pilgrims. It was also once believed that the incense smoke guarded against contracting the many diseases that plagued the populace in past centuries.

Some thuribles were based on an architectural motif, for example the Gozbert Censer from the Cathedral of Trier inspired by the Temple of Solomon.

== Hindu use ==

Hindus have traditionally used an earthen censer called a Dhunachi for burning incense with coal, though coconut husk is also used. The vessel has a flared shape with a curved handle and an open top. There are also brass and silver versions.

<doc id="270555" wikidata="Q144185" url="?curid=270555" title="Zahra Kazemi">
<text>Zahra &quot;Ziba&quot; Kazemi-Ahmadabadi (; 1948 – 11 July 2003) was an Iranian-Canadian freelance photojournalist. She gained notoriety for her arrest in Iran and the circumstances in which she was held by Iranian authorities, in whose custody she was killed. Kazemi&#x27;s autopsy report revealed that she had been raped and tortured by Iranian officials while she was at Evin Prison, located within the capital city of Tehran.

Although Iranian authorities insist that her death was accidental and that she died of a stroke while being interrogated, Shahram Azam, a former military staff physician who used his purported knowledge of Kazemi&#x27;s case for seeking asylum in Canada in 2004, has stated that he examined Kazemi&#x27;s body and observed that she showed obvious signs of torture, including a skull fracture, nasal fracture, signs of rape, and severe abdominal bruising.

Her death was the first time that an Iranian death in government custody attracted major international attention. Because of her dual citizenship and the circumstances of her death, she has since become an international cause célèbre. In November 2003, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression honoured Kazemi with the Tara Singh Hayer Memorial Award in recognition of her courage in defending the right to freedom of expression.

==Life and death==
Kazemi was born in Shiraz, Iran, and moved to France in 1974 to study literature and cinema at the University of Paris. With her son, Stephan Hachemi, she immigrated to Canada in 1993 and settled in Montreal, Quebec, where she later gained Canadian citizenship and became a dual citizen. She worked in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean and then more frequently in various Middle Eastern countries, including the Palestinian territories, Iraq, and Afghanistan. She visited the latter two countries both before and during the American occupation. Immediately before her traveling to Iran, Kazemi revisited Iraq, documenting the U.S. occupation. Recurrent themes in her work were the documentation of poverty, destitution, forced exile and oppression, and also the strength of women in these situations.

===Arrest===

Traveling back to her birth country using her Iranian passport, Kazemi was allowed into Iran to take photographs of the possible demonstrations that were expected to take place in Tehran in July 2003. The demonstrations took place and were effectively crushed after the sixth day by a massive deployment of security forces and paramilitary vigilantes, or &quot;plainclothesmen.&quot; Following the clampdown, an estimated 4000 students &quot;had gone missing&quot; and were thought to have been arrested for protesting and taken to Evin prison, Tehran&#x27;s political prisoner detention facility. As was customary after such events, family members of the missing gathered outside of Evin prison in the north of Tehran in hopes of learning what had happened to their children. On 23 June 2003, Kazemi drove to the prison to take pictures of these family members, possessing a government-issued press card that she thought made it permissible for her to work around Tehran, including at Evin.

According to Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian lawyer and former judge who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 and later became the main representative of Kazemi&#x27;s family at the trial over Kazemi&#x27;s death, a prison staff member saw Kazemi taking photographs and demanded that she give him her camera, as photography is prohibited in front of the prison.
Worried that officials might harass the families whose photos she had already taken, she flashed her press card and exposed the film to the light. The guard angrily yelled at her, ‘I didn&#x27;t ask you to expose your film, I told you to give me your camera’ ‘You can have the camera,’ she retorted, ‘but the film belongs to me.’ She was detained and interrogated over the next three days by police officers, prosecutors, and intelligence officials.

The Evin prison staff, whom the Kazemi family&#x27;s lawyers consider a party in the beatings that led to Kazemi&#x27;s death, say that she had been in a sensitive area, photographing parts of the prison. Several days after her arrest, hardline newspapers ran stories &quot;calling her a spy who had entered the country undercover as a journalist.&quot;

Kazemi insisted that she did not photograph any part of the prison, only the street and the demonstrators, who were family members of activist students jailed in prison.

===Death===
On 11 July 2003, nineteen days after she was arrested, Kazemi died in Iranian custody in Baghiyyatollah al-Azam Military Hospital. Two days later, Iran&#x27;s official IRNA news agency reported that Kazemi had suffered a stroke while she was being interrogated and died in hospital. This account changed to one that Kazemi had died after falling and hitting her head. On 16 July 2003, Iran&#x27;s vice-president, Mohammad Ali Abtahi, &quot;conceded that Kazemi died as a result of being beaten&quot;. Mohammad Ali Abtahi (Vice President of Legal Affairs) and Masoud Pezeshkian (Minister of Health and Medical Education) admitted that she died of a fractured skull as a result of being hit in the head. Abtahi claims that he was under a lot of pressure to take back the acknowledgment, but he resisted it.

Shirin Ebadi reports that security officials searched the house of an unnamed friend that Kazemi had been staying at and &quot;kept asking&quot; her friend about Kazemi&#x27;s &quot;‘medical condition’ and what medicines she took daily.&quot; Officials also kept Kazemi&#x27;s elderly, frail mother, who had journeyed from Shiraz to see her only child, from seeing Kazemi until they had questioned her about the medicines they insisted her daughter must be using. Kazemi&#x27;s friend told Ebadi that she later realized this meant Kazemi was dead, and the officials &quot;wanted to claim that Ziba had a preexisting condition that had simply worsened in prison.&quot;

The story did not become a major controversy until almost two years later, when Shahram Azam, a former staff physician in Iran&#x27;s Defence Ministry, released a statement saying that he examined Kazemi in hospital four days after her arrest and found obvious signs of torture, including:

*Evidence of a very brutal rape
*A skull fracture, two broken fingers, missing fingernails, a crushed big toe, and a broken nose.
*Severe abdominal bruising, swelling behind the head, and a bruised shoulder.
*Deep scratches on the neck and evidence of flogging on the legs.
One of the two Iranian intelligence agents charged with her death was acquitted in September 2003. The other agent, Mohammed Reza Aghdam-Ahmadi (محمدرضا اقدم احمدی), was charged with &quot;semi-intentional murder&quot; and his trial opened in Tehran in October 2003. In the same month, the Iranian parliament condemned Saeed Mortazavi, a Tehran prosecutor, for announcing that Kazemi had died of a stroke. On 25 July 2004, Aghdam-Ahmadi was acquitted.

==Murder trial==
Shirin Ebadi was the main representative of Kazemi&#x27;s family at the trial, and represented them at the second and third sessions of Aghdam-Ahmadi&#x27;s trial, which took place on 17–18 July 2004. In the court, Kazemi&#x27;s mother mentioned that she wanted the real murderer to be prosecuted. She also mentioned that she saw Kazemi&#x27;s body before the burial, upon which there were signs of torture.

Ebadi and the other lawyers of the family insisted in the court that they know that Kazemi was not killed by Aghdam-Ahmadi, and they need witnesses to be brought to the court to find the real murderer, who they guessed may be Mohammad Bakhshi, a high officer of the Evin prison. The list of witnesses they requested included Saeed Mortazavi, the general prosecutor of Tehran, Mohsen Armin, reformist member of the previous parliament , Jamileh Kadivar, and Mohsen Mirdamadi, Minister of Intelligence Ali Younesi, the Vice President of Legal Affairs Mohammad Ali Abtahi, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ahmad Masjedjamei, the five judges who were present during Kazemi&#x27;s interrogation, a few employees of the Evin prison, the president of the Baghiyyatollah hospital, and all of the medical staff who had signed her file. Judge Farahani denied all of the requests. The lawyers also quoted the official report of death that various parts of Kazemi&#x27;s body had been damaged and her clothes were torn and bloody, which proves that she had been tortured.

On 14 July 2004, the Iranian government rejected requests for Canadian government observers to attend the trial, despite promises and assurances by the Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and judiciary officials to the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham. The same day, Graham recalled the ambassador at Tehran, Philip MacKinnon. MacKinnon, together with the Dutch ambassador (representing the European Union) and diplomats from the British and French embassies, were later allowed to attend the 17 July trial, though not the 18 July one. Judge Farahani was quoted on 18 July as saying that &quot;(he) made a mistake yesterday. The bar is to show the world that Iran won&#x27;t bow under pressure.&quot; Hamid Reza Assefi, the spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said &quot;We hadn&#x27;t permitted an observer from the beginning. But you should ask the reason for the ban from the court, there may have been a shortage of seats.&quot; Assefi also said that since Iran does not recognize dual nationality and Kazemi was an Iranian citizen who entered the country under an Iranian passport, never having requested her citizenship to be removed, that the case was clearly an internal affair.

The trial sessions ended on 18 July, with the lawyers of the Kazemi family insisting that the time had not been enough for proofs to be given, witnesses to be brought to court, and the murderer to be identified. They also mentioned that the court didn&#x27;t pay attention to their evidence. They refused to sign the session notes. The Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister, Bill Graham, defined these events as &quot;flagrant denial of due process&quot;.

On 24 July 2003, Judge Farahani issued his judgment, clearing Aghdam-Ahmadi of the charges. He also mentioned that since the murderer has not been found, according to the Islamic sources the blood money should be paid by the government to the family. The lawyers of Kazemi&#x27;s family announced that they will appeal the case, asking for a criminal court to be established to reconsider the whole case, or completing the numerous incompletenesses of the file. They also mentioned that if the family asks, they will bring the case to the international authorities, mentioning Iran&#x27;s 1954 signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The end of July saw Iran&#x27;s judiciary adding &quot;accidental fall&quot; and &quot;hunger strike&quot; to the list of alleged causes for Kazemi&#x27;s death. They claimed that Kazemi had gone on a hunger strike voluntarily, developed low blood pressure that made her dizzy, fell, and hit her head. Detractors point out that this story does not explain her broken bones, genital injuries or skin lacerations.

==Timeline of events following Kazemi&#x27;s death==
*13 July 2003 – IRNA, Iran&#x27;s official news agency, reports that Kazemi &quot;suffered a stroke when she was subject to interrogation and died in hospital.&quot; The same day, under pressure from Canada, Iran&#x27;s president, Mohammad Khatami, orders an assembly of five ministers to investigate her death.
*16 July 2003 – Kazemi&#x27;s son, Stephan Hachemi, says he believes his mother has in fact been buried in Iran and is demanding the body be returned to Canada.
*20 July 2003 – IRNA reports that Kazemi died from a fractured skull caused by &quot;a physical attack.&quot;
*21 July 2003 – Prosecutor General Saeed Mortazavi is appointed by Iran to head an independent investigative group to look into Kazemi&#x27;s death. This appointment is immediately fiercely attacked by pro-reformist Iranian MPs, as Mortazavi had himself been accused of failing to prevent Kazemi&#x27;s death, and was widely believed to be behind a recent wave of arrests of writers and journalists. Given this controversy, the investigation appeared unlikely to mollify Canada, which was growing increasingly impatient with Iran&#x27;s unwillingness to &quot;clearly demonstrate that officials are not allowed to act with impunity&quot; (Foreign Minister Bill Graham, news conference).
*23 July 2003 – Kazemi&#x27;s body is buried in her hometown of Shiraz in Iran, supposedly according to the wishes of her mother (Ezzat Kazemi) and relatives in Iran, but contrary to the wishes of her son (Stephan Hachemi, who resides in Montreal), and Canadian officials. Canada recalls its ambassador to Iran, and discusses the possibility of sanctions against Iran. (Her mother later said that she had been put under pressure to approve of an Iranian burial.)
*25 July 2003 – The Iranian Foreign Minister echoes the words of Canadian officials almost word for word while addressing Ottawa, in reference to the death of an 18-year-old Iranian citizen (Keyvan Tabesh) in Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada, by plainclothes police officers. The shooting occurred around the same time as Ms. Kazemi&#x27;s death. He demands that Canadian officials &quot;clearly demonstrate that officials in Canada are not allowed to act with impunity, ... [and] The Islamic republic will seek through diplomatic channels clear and convincing explanations of this crime.&quot; A Port Moody police investigation later finds that the use of force in the incident was consistent with police guidelines.
*26 July 2003 – Iran announces that it has arrested five members of its security services in connection with the investigation, and gives no further details.
*30 July 2003 – Iran&#x27;s vice-president, Mohammad Ali Abtahi says that Kazemi was probably murdered by government agents.
*25 August 2003 – Two Iranian intelligence agents who had interrogated Kazemi are charged with complicity in her death. The Teheran prosecutor&#x27;s office releases a statement reading in part, &quot;The charges leveled against the interrogators, who are said to be members of the Intelligence Ministry, are announced as complicity in semi-intentional murder.&quot;
*26 July 2004 – Kazemi&#x27;s mother told the court that her daughter had been tortured, and said she was pressured into burying her daughter at her birthplace in southern Iran under duress to deny Canada the opportunity to carry out its own autopsy.
*31 March 2005 – Dr. Shahram Azam, the Iranian doctor who examined Kazemi just prior to her death, said he was shocked by the extent of her injuries, and felt she had been tortured. He reported injuries consistent with torture, such as flogging wounds on the back and missing fingernails. A female nurse told him of &quot;brutal&quot; genital injuries. Azam did not give her a vaginal examination himself as it is considered inappropriate in Iran for a male physician to examine a woman in this manner. Azam fled the country, seeking political asylum in Canada to tell his story.

==Aftermath==
In June 2005, an exhibition at the municipal Côte-Saint-Luc Library in Montreal of photos taken by Zahra Kazemi during her travels in Middle East was shut down following accusations by Jewish patrons of alleged &quot;pro-Palestinian bias&quot; for including five of her photographs on display that depicted scenes inside Palestinian refugee camps. Gallery officials proceeded to remove the five photographs while leaving the rest of the exhibition. In response, Kazemi&#x27;s son, Stephen Hachemi, called the removal of the Palestinian photographs &quot;a violation of my mother&#x27;s spirit&quot; and demanded that the library either display the entire collection or nothing at all. Eventually, the library closed the entire exhibition.

Côte Saint-Luc Mayor Robert Libman told CBC news &quot;It&#x27;s a very complicated conflict, and to create an impression where the Palestinian cause is being martyred by oppression by the Israeli government, we don&#x27;t consider that to be a fair portrait, in the future, such politically charged work won&#x27;t be displayed at the library&quot;. Critics of the decision to take down the exhibition denounced it as &quot;censorship&quot;. Naomi Klein and Aaron Maté wrote that it is &quot;part of a disturbing pattern to silence opposition to the expansionist Israeli occupation of the Occupied Territories&quot;. According to the caption that accompanied the photo exhibition, she &quot;illustrated the daily life of Palestinians and the problems they faced as they sought to preserve their land and their identity&quot; in the face of &quot;exodus, poverty, humiliation, suffering, and the ravages of war&quot;.

Her life was one of the inspirations for the popular webcomic, &quot;Zahra&#x27;s Paradise&quot;.

<text>Inner Sanctum Mystery, also known as Inner Sanctum, is a popular old-time radio program that aired from January 7, 1941, to October 5, 1952. It was created by producer Himan Brown and was based on the imprint given to the mystery novels of Simon &amp; Schuster. In all, 526 episodes were broadcast.

==Simon &amp; Schuster series==
In 1930, the first title was published in Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; mystery series: &quot;I Am Jonathan Scrivener&quot; by Claude Houghton. Although the imprint &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; also included serious drama (published with blue covers) and romance (published with red covers), for the most part it was associated with mysteries (published in green covers). Lee Wright was the editor of the series, and over the years she introduced such authors as Craig Rice, Gypsy Rose Lee, Patrick Quentin, Thomas Sterling and Anthony Boucher.

==Horror hosts==
On January 7, 1941, the &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; radio program premiered, the name licensed by Simon &amp; Schuster on condition that at the end of each broadcast the announcer would promote the latest book title published in the series. The anthology series featured stories of mystery, terror and suspense, and its tongue-in-cheek introductions were in sharp contrast to shows like &quot;Suspense&quot; and &quot;The Whistler&quot;. The early 1940s programs opened with Raymond Edward Johnson introducing himself as &quot;Your host, Raymond&quot; in a mockingly sardonic voice. A spooky melodramatic organ score (played by Lew White) punctuated Raymond&#x27;s many morbid jokes and playful puns. Raymond&#x27;s closing was an elongated &quot;Pleasant dreeeeaams, hmmmmm?&quot; His tongue-in-cheek style and ghoulish relish of his own tales became the standard for many such horror narrators to follow, such as Maurice Tarplin (on &quot;The Mysterious Traveler&quot;).

When Johnson left the series in May 1945 to serve in the Army, he was replaced by Paul McGrath, who did not keep the &quot;Raymond&quot; name and was known only as &quot;Your Host&quot; or &quot;Mr. Host&quot;. (Berry Kroeger had substituted earlier for a total of four episodes.) McGrath was a Broadway actor who turned to radio for a regular income. Beginning in 1945, Lipton Tea sponsored the series, pairing first Raymond and then McGrath with cheery commercial spokeswoman Mary Bennett (aka the &quot;Tea Lady&quot;), whose blithesome pitches for Lipton Tea contrasted sharply with the macabre themes of the stories. She primly chided the host for his trademark dark humor and creepy manner.

==The creaking door==
The program&#x27;s familiar and famed audio trademark was the eerie creaking door which opened and closed the broadcasts. Himan Brown got the idea from a door in the basement that &quot;squeaked like Hell.&quot; The door sound was actually made by a rusty desk chair. The program did originally intend to use a door, but on its first use, the door did not creak. Undaunted, Brown grabbed a nearby chair, sat in it and turned, causing a hair-raising squeak. The chair was used from then on as the sound prop. On at least one memorable occasion, a staffer innocently repaired and oiled the chair, thus forcing the sound man to mimic the squeak orally.

==Guest stars==
The stories were effective little chillers, mixing horror and humor in equal doses. Memorable episodes included &quot;Terror by Night&quot; (September 18, 1945) and an adaptation of &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; (August 3, 1941). The latter starred Boris Karloff, who was heard regularly in the first season, starring in more than 15 episodes and returning sporadically thereafter.

Other established film stars who appeared on the program in the early years included Bela Lugosi, Mary Astor, Helen Hayes, Peter Lorre, Paul Lukas, Claude Rains, Frank Sinatra, and Orson Welles. Most of the lead and supporting players were stalwarts of New York radio. These included Santos Ortega, Larry Haines, Ted Osborne, Luis van Rooten, Stefan Schnabel, Ralph Bell, Mercedes McCambridge, Berry Kroeger, Arnold Moss, Leon Janney, Myron McCormick, and Mason Adams. Players like Richard Widmark, Everett Sloane, Burgess Meredith, Agnes Moorehead, Ken Lynch, and Anne Seymour also found fame or notability in film or television.

Of more than 500 programs broadcast, only about 200 remain in circulation.

==Example program opening==
Sound effect: A door with squeaky hinges is slowly opened. Organ begins to play.

Raymond: Good evening, friends of the &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;. This is Raymond, your host. I&#x27;m glad you came tonight, because we have a very special guest of horror with us. I&#x27;d like you to meet the late Johnny Gravestone, the most celebrated member of the Inner Sanctum Ghost Society. He&#x27;s the best haunter of them all. Johnny&#x27;s the tall figure in the white sheet wearing the blue ribbon. He&#x27;s haunted everything from a palace to a telephone booth. And uh, if you&#x27;re very nice to him, he&#x27;ll be glad to consider giving your house the once-over. Who knows? He might even haunt you! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

(Commercial)

Raymond: Well, we&#x27;re about to begin our story. Oh, I forgot to warn you about the Trembliens. They&#x27;re those pesky, invisible cousins of the gremlins. They uh, you, give quick little shoves, and give the false impression that you&#x27;re trembling. If you&#x27;re being troubled by a Tremblien, just grab him by his invisible little horns and stick him into the nearest pin cushion.

==Films==

In June 1943, Universal purchased the screen rights to the series from Simon and Schuster, Inc. The &quot;Inner Sanctum Mysteries&quot; feature a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; voiceover which Edward Dein stated he incorporated into his script at Lon Chaney Jr.&#x27;s insistence. With the exception of &quot;Pillow of Death&quot;, each film is prefaced with a sequence featuring the bobbing head of actor David Hoffman staring out of a crystal ball, giving warnings to the audience about how each audience member is capable of murder.

Lon Chaney Jr. was hopeful for the series, craving diversity in his roles after Universal had placed him in various monster roles in their horror films. Pivar planned to produce two &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; mystery films a year with each film featuring Chaney and Gale Sondergaard in the lead roles. Sondergaard was dropped from the lead role shortly before the filming of &quot;Calling Dr. Death&quot;.

The films in the series are &quot;Calling Dr. Death&quot; (1943), &quot;Weird Woman&quot; (1944), &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Eyes&quot; (1944), &quot;The Frozen Ghost&quot; (1945), &quot;Strange Confession&quot; (1945) and &quot;Pillow of Death (1945).

From retrospective reviews, Kim Newman described the film series as &quot;straddling whodunnit and horror&quot; and that &quot;the films vary in quality but mostly deliver as strange entertainment.&quot; Newman found that &quot;Weird Woman&quot; was the standout film in the &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; series, being the sole entry in the series to have supernatural elements. The authors of the book &quot;Universal Horrors&quot; declared the series &quot;feeble melodramas with little to recommend them beyond their camp qualities and the morose spectacle of seeing a badly miscast Chaney struggle his way through acting assignments that were painfully beyond his depth.&quot; They concluded that the series was &quot;generally regarded by buffs and film historians as a missed cinematic opportunity.&quot;

==Television==
The 1954 syndicated television series featured Paul McGrath as the off-camera host/narrator. The TV shows were produced at the Himan Brown Production Center (now Chelsea Studios) in Manhattan.

==&quot;Pleasant dreeeeaaams, hmmmmm?&quot;==
In the 1970s, with his &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; series, Himan Brown recycled both the creaking door opening and, to a lesser extent, the manner of Raymond. The hosts were E. G. Marshall and during the final season, Tammy Grimes. When the series was rebroadcast during the late 1990s, Brown himself rerecorded the host segments and mimicked Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Pleasant dreeeeaaams, hmmmmm?&quot; for the familiar closing.

==Satires==
Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder satirized the series in &quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s fifth issue (June–July 1953) with &quot;Outer Sanctum!&quot; In the opening panels, host Ramon greets the reader: &quot;Come in, I&#x27;ve been waiting for you! I&#x27;ve been waiting for you to fix my squeaking door!... What?... You say you&#x27;re not the carpenter?... You have come to hear a story?... Very well!&quot;

In the Three Stooges short &quot;The Ghost Talks&quot;, a creaking door prompts Shemp to parody the opening narration of the program, naming it &quot;The Outer Sanctorum.&quot;

The opening of an &quot;Inner Sanctum&quot; episode was used to open one side of &quot;The Whole Burbank Catalog&quot;, a 1972 compilation album in the Warner/Reprise Loss Leaders series from Warner Bros. Records. The announcer&#x27;s jokey pun in this case concerned an author friend, specializing in best-sellers, who &quot;tried to bury [him] in one, because all the very best sellers (cellars) have corpses in them.&quot; A backwards version of the creaking door sound effect led directly into &quot;Get It On&quot; by T. Rex.

The popular British 60s radio comedy &quot;Round The Horne&quot; had occasional sketches that were influenced by the style of the show. Regular cast member Hugh Paddick would introduce the &quot;scary&quot; sketch with the words &quot;Inner Sanctum-um-um-um-um-um...&quot; – pretending to echo! This was accompanied by a warbling, quivering, high pitched tone from a Theremin played by an orchestra member. The sketches nearly always ended in confusion as the plots were deliberately circular and convoluted whilst playing up the &quot;spookiness&quot; of the part.

The 1946 Warner Brothers Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Racketeer Rabbit&quot; had Bugs enter an abandoned Victorian house (which was actually the gangsters&#x27; hideout) that had a squeaky door. Bugs said as he was entering the house, &quot;Huh? Sounds like Inner Sanctum!&quot;

<text>A captive bead ring (CBR), ball closure ring (BCR), captive hoop, or captive ball ring is a common example of body piercing jewelry.

The captive bead or ball fits into a small opening in the circle of the ring. The bead is slightly larger than this opening and has small indentations or depressions that correspond to the ring&#x27;s end-points so that it may fit snugly against them, thus completing the circuit of the ring. Often, a hole is drilled through the bead to allow easier fitting.

It uses the natural tensile or compressive strength of the metal the ring is made of, usually surgical stainless steel, niobium, or titanium, to hold the bead tightly in place. The bead or ball itself may additionally be made from coloured glass, acrylic or ceramic, or a gemstone.

This is a popular piece of body jewelry because it conveniently allows the wearer to remove the ring by simply removing the captive bead; the bead is held firmly in place so that it will not easily fall out. Additionally, because of their closed shape and rounded edges, these rings do not easily snag on clothing, hair, or furniture, making them a popular choice for piercings which are still healing. However, its circular shape means that it can drag dried lymph back into the healing piercing, meaning that barbells are seen as being preferable for certain healing piercings.</text><links>

<doc id="270578" wikidata="Q56580" url="?curid=270578" title="Digital hardcore">
<text>Digital hardcore is a fusion genre that combines hardcore punk with electronic dance music genres such as breakbeat, techno, and drum and bass while also drawing on heavy metal, industrial and noise music. It typically features fast tempos and aggressive sound samples. The style was pioneered by Alec Empire of the German band Atari Teenage Riot during the early 1990s, and often has sociological or leftist lyrical themes.

==Characteristics==
Digital hardcore music is typically fast and abrasive, combining the speed, heaviness and attitude of hardcore punk, thrash metal, and riot grrrl with electronic music such as hardcore techno, gabber, jungle, drum and bass, glitch, and industrial rock. Some bands, like Atari Teenage Riot, incorporate elements of hip-hop music, such as freestyle rap.

According to Jeff Terich of &quot;Treble Media&quot;, digital hardcore is &quot;on the verge of reaching speeds incompatible with popular music, as if the rapid acceleration of BPMs would render the idea of rhythm irrelevant or, at the very least, unpredictable. Maybe this is music for dancing; definitely this is music for screaming and breaking things.&quot;

The electric guitar (either real or sampled and usually heavily distorted) is used alongside samplers, synthesizers and drum machines. While the use of electronic instruments is a defining feature of the genre, bass guitars, electric guitars, and drum kits are optional. Vocals are more often shouted than sung by more than one member of the group. Typically, the lyrics are highly politicized and espouse left-wing or anarchist ideals. Some practitioners have been influenced by anarcho-punk.

==History==

===1990s===

The music was first defined by the band Atari Teenage Riot, who formed in Berlin, Germany in 1992. The band&#x27;s frontman, Alec Empire, coined the term &quot;digital hardcore,&quot; setting up the independent record label Digital Hardcore Recordings in 1994. German bands with a similar style began signing to the label and its underground popularity grew, with small digital hardcore festivals being held in several German cities. By the mid-1990s, a number of new record labels specializing in the genre were formed around the world. These included Gangster Toons Industries (Paris), Praxis (London), Cross Fade Enter Tainment (Hamburg), Drop Bass Network (U.S.), and Bloody Fist (Australia). Digital Hardcore Recordings also had some kinship with the Frankfurt labels Mille Plateaux and Riot Beats. Alec Empire&#x27;s work subsequently set the template for breakcore.

Other prominent digital hardcore musicians of this period include Christoph de Babalon, Cobra Killer, Sonic Subjunkies, EC8OR, Hanin Elias, Lolita Storm, Nic Endo, The Panacea, and The Mad Capsule Markets.

===2000s===
In Alec Empire&#x27;s words, &quot;Digital Hardcore went from a local, Berlin based scene to an international underground movement.&quot; The soundtrack to the film &quot;Threat&quot; included contributions from digital hardcore musicians, along with metalcore bands. James Plotkin, Dave Witte and Speedranch&#x27;s project Phantomsmasher combined digital hardcore with grindcore. Notable 21st century digital hardcore groups include Left Spine Down, Motormark, Death Spells, The Shizit, Rabbit Junk, and Fear, and Loathing in Las Vegas.

===2010s===
Digital hardcore saw less prominence in the 2010s. However, its international influence can be seen in the prominence of electronicore, a similar musical genre fusing hardcore punk and metalcore with electronica. The German band We Butter the Bread with Butter has seen commercial success employing this fusion. The term &quot;digital hardcore&quot; has largely fallen out of use, given its association with politically charged lyrics, which are not a characteristic of newer electronicore artists.

One notable digital hardcore band to come out of the 2010s was Machine Girl, especially with their 2017 album &quot;&quot;...Because I&#x27;m Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For&quot;,&quot; which combined their earlier modern breakcore style with more extreme hardcore punk vocals.

===2020s===
Coming into the 2020s, digital hardcore has seen a rise with new releases and artists, such as LustSickPuppy. Notable mainstream success within the digital hardcore genre has been seen with the British band WARGASM, whose debut EP, &quot;Explicit: The Mixxxtape&quot;, was released on 9 September 2022.

<doc id="270596" wikidata="Q651483" url="?curid=270596" title="Gag">
<text>A gag is usually an item or device designed to prevent speech, often as a restraint device to stop the subject from calling for help and keep its wearer silent. This is usually done by blocking the mouth, partially or completely, or attempting to prevent the tongue, lips, or jaw from moving in the normal patterns of speech. The more &quot;effective&quot; a gag appears to be, the more hazardous it is. For example duct tape is a fairly effective method of keeping a person&#x27;s mouth shut but can be hazardous if the subject cannot breathe freely through the nose (for example if they have the common cold). For this reason, a gagged person should never be left alone.

The use of gags is commonly depicted in soap operas and crime fiction, particularly in comics, novels and films.

Courts have been known to gag certain people, such as the civil rights activist Bobby Seale. This practice has been criticized as inhumane.

==Types of gags==

One type of gag familiar in fiction, particularly in crime comics and novels, is a suitably sized piece of cloth pulled over the subject&#x27;s mouth and tied at the back of their head. It is sometimes called the &quot;detective gag&quot; because many of its first appearances were in crime serials.

Sometimes a gag is pushed back between the victim&#x27;s front teeth into the mouth, or with a hard ball in its middle or reinforced by pushing small cloth items into the mouth. This is common in BDSM, but in practice these sorts of gag can usually be dislodged by working the jaws about and/or pushing with the tongue, and they often do not stop the victim from making a loud inarticulate noise to call for help.

Often adhesive tapes are used for improvised gags. A tape gag can cause the skin on the lips to be damaged in its removal or the adhesive can cause chemical burns or reactions.

==Other uses of the word==
The word &quot;gag&quot; has come to have various extended meanings, for example:
* Various sorts of laws and orders preventing or stopping discussion or revealing of information, e.g., a parliamentary procedure to end a debate. See gag order.
* A gag rule can be a part of court proceedings and congressional proceedings. 
* Gag (medical device), to keep the mouth open
* A gag bit is a special bit type used with horses.

==In symbolism==
* Sometimes in political cartoons, a character is shown gagged to represent that in the real world some law or rule or order is preventing him/her from speaking about some matter (see gag order).
* A gag that is specifically two stripes of red tape as an X is often used to represent censorship.

== See also ==
* Gag (BDSM), gags used for sexual purposes
* Mouth taping, sleeping with the lips taped shut
* Muzzle, devices to prevent animals from biting

<text>Alec Empire (born Alexander Wilke-Steinhof on 2 May 1972) is a German experimental electronic musician who is best known as a founding member of the band Atari Teenage Riot, as well as a solo artist, producer and DJ. He has released many albums, EPs and singles, some under aliases, and remixed over seventy tracks for various artists including Björk. He was also the driving force behind the creation of the digital hardcore genre, and founded the record labels Digital Hardcore Recordings and Eat Your Heart Out Records.

==Biography==
Wilke&#x27;s father was a working-class socialist, himself the son of a radical activist who perished in the Nazi concentration camps of World War II. His maternal grandfather, Karl Steinhof, was a self-made millionaire who patented the first domestic hand-knitting appliance during the economic boom in Germany in the 1950s.

Wilke grew up during the Cold War near the Berlin Wall, which he passed every day on his way to school. The frequent sight of patrol guards with guns influenced his outlook on life from an early age. He describes Berlin at the time as: &quot;Probably the most left radical place in Germany in the 70s, terrorists, a lot of demonstrations, and probably the first address to hear the latest American music, because of the radio shows the US soldiers brought to Berlin.&quot;

===Early influences and career===
At the age of ten, Wilke&#x27;s love of hip hop led to a vogueing career on the streets of Berlin. Later disillusioned by that genre becoming increasingly commercial, he left it behind in favour of a completely different form of musical expression. He had played guitar since the age of eight which coupled with his politically charged upbringing eventually led him to punk music; he formed his first band, Die Kinder (The Kids), at age twelve.

By sixteen, however, Wilke came to believe that the punk movement was &quot;dead&quot; (though the anti-establishment punk attitude would figure significantly in his subsequent output). After leaving Die Kinder, he began listening to classical music and experimenting with electronic instruments. He eventually became fascinated by the rave scene, and, following German reunification, frequented underground raves in East Berlin, believing his native West Berlin scene to be too commercialised. Known earlier in his career as LX Empire he produced a great deal of what he refers to as &quot;faceless DJ music&quot;. In 1991, while DJing on a beach in France with his friend Hanin Elias, he caught the attention of Ian Pooley, which led to the release of a number of 12&quot; records on the Force Inc. label.

Although Empire was a prolific producer and DJ at this time, and made a comfortable enough living, he nevertheless saw the rave scene as decadent and selfish. This angered him, as he and his friends lived in a city embroiled in politics, and the demise of communist-led governments had given rise to increased conservatism in Germany, whilst few people cared. The German neo-Nazi movement had invaded the scene, declaring trance techno &quot;true German music&quot;.

Empire retaliated by utilising samples of 1960s and 1970s funk – a predominantly black style of music – in his solo work. In order to further spread the message, he gathered like-minded individuals Hanin Elias (also a former punk) and Carl Crack (a Swazi MC) to form a band. In 1992, the trio became known as Atari Teenage Riot (ATR).

===Atari Teenage Riot and Digital Hardcore Recordings===

In Empire&#x27;s words, Atari Teenage Riot&#x27;s complex musical style was intended to &quot;destroy&quot; the &quot;simulated harmony&quot; of the mainstream electronic music, and that, besides their protest lyrics, &quot;riot sound produce riots&quot;. Empire, who is straight edge, also stated that it was a reaction to both the fashion-victimized and drug-fueled nihilism of the rave scene of the 1990s, once saying that &quot;You can&#x27;t read or do anything else while listening to our music.&quot;

ATR signed a record deal with Phonogram, a major UK label, in 1993. The two parted ways after only a couple of single releases, due to the band&#x27;s refusal to play by the label&#x27;s rules. In 1994, using the non-refundable cash advance from the deal, Empire started an independent record label that allowed its artists the freedom of expression Phonogram were unlikely to give. He named it Digital Hardcore Recordings (DHR); the direction his sound had taken came to be known as &quot;digital hardcore&quot;. That year, DHR released EPs by EC8OR, Sonic Subjunkies, and Empire himself.

While working with ATR, Empire continued steadily with his solo output. He recorded for Force Inc. under several pseudonyms, including the Detroit techno-inspired Jaguar. He also recorded several albums for Force Inc.&#x27;s experimental sub-label Mille Plateaux, including &quot;Generation Star Wars&quot; (his first full solo album) and &quot;Low on Ice&quot;, which he recorded entirely on his laptop during a three-day tour of Iceland with ATR. In 1995, ATR released their first proper album, &quot;Delete Yourself!&quot;, on DHR, and, in 1996, Empire released his first solo album for DHR, &quot;The Destroyer&quot;. In that year, Empire and Mike D signed a deal to release a number of DHR&#x27;s recordings on the Beastie Boys&#x27; Grand Royal record label in the United States.

ATR spent the next few years touring the world with artists such as Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Beck, Rage Against the Machine, the Wu-Tang Clan and Ministry, as well as headlining shows as the Digital Hardcore festival at CBGB&#x27;s in New York City in 1998, and the Queen Elizabeth Hall show in London in 1999 at the request of fan John Peel. During this time they introduced Nic Endo to their ranks as a fourth member.

All of the members found some comfort in their solo work – Empire&#x27;s output at this time would include his sole release as Nintendo Teenage Robots, and the bootleg recording &quot;Alec Empire vs. Elvis Presley&quot;, as well as remixes for the likes of The Mad Capsule Markets, Mogwai and Thurston Moore. However, ATR&#x27;s problems worsened. Onstage at one show in Seattle in 1999, Empire slashed his forearms with a razor. At another show that year in London, in which ATR supported Nine Inch Nails, the band dispensed with the usual song-based formula and delivered one long barrage of what could only be described as &quot;noise&quot;; this would later be released as &quot;Live at Brixton Academy&quot;.

By the end of 1999, Empire was mentally exhausted, Elias was pregnant and Crack was suffering from psychosis induced by prolonged drug use. The band was put on hiatus; its future was made even more doubtful following Crack&#x27;s death in 2001, and Elias&#x27; decision to leave DHR and create Fatal Recordings.

===After ATR===

Empire rebounded in 2001 when he, with assistance from Endo, recorded &quot;Intelligence and Sacrifice&quot;. The album contained two discs: the first retained the ATR formula, yet exhibited a more polished production style and lyrics of an unusually introspective nature; the second disc was an electronic instrumental album, and in contrast was more experimental. He used an all-star lineup in his first live &quot;Alec Empire&quot; show at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan: Charlie Clouser (ex-Nine Inch Nails) played synths, Masami &quot;Merzbow&quot; Akita and Gabe Serbian (The Locust) both played drums, and Endo played synths and keyboards.

Empire&#x27;s next lineup would include a guitarist, Robbie Furze, who would later record for DHR with Panic DHH. Empire also played a series of live shows performing material from the second disc of &quot;Intelligence and Sacrifice&quot;; one of these was released as &quot;The CD2 Sessions&quot; in 2003. He returned in 2005 with &quot;Futurist&quot;, which was less electronic than its predecessor and had more of a raw punk-rock sound, albeit assisted by drum machines and some processing.

Empire began 2006 by DJing at industrial pioneers Throbbing Gristle&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve party. During that year he remixed fellow Germans Rammstein (whom he once said were &quot;successful for all the wrong reasons&quot;) and New York hardcore band Most Precious Blood. He also recorded a cover version of The Monks&#x27; &quot;Monk Time&quot; for a tribute album with that band&#x27;s singer Gary Burger, and Russell Simins of Blues Explosion. &quot;Atari Teenage Riot: 1992-2000&quot;, a retrospective album, was released by DHR on 3 July 2006.

===After DHR===

In 2007, Empire announced that DHR would henceforth assume a more &quot;underground&quot; role, as his focus turned to a new label, Eat Your Heart Out Records, which he describes as &quot;the sound of New Berlin&quot;. The label&#x27;s first release was his 12&quot; single &quot;Robot L.O.V.E.&quot;, followed by an album, &quot;The Golden Foretaste of Heaven&quot;, recorded with his new production team and touring band The Hellish Vortex, released in Japan on 28 November 2007 and in Europe on 21 January 2008. The second single release, the &quot;On Fire EP&quot;, was released on 7 December. &quot;Sixteen Years of Video Material&quot;, a DVD featuring rare footage of Empire and ATR was released on German video label Monitorpop in July 2008.

In February 2017 Empire released an original soundtrack album for the German sci-fi thriller &quot;Volt&quot;.

==Style==
Alec Empire&#x27;s body of work spans a range of electronic (as well as conventionally less electronic) styles. His earlier releases for Force Inc. were influenced by the rave scene in his native Berlin, and included acid house, techno, hardcore, punk and breakbeat (all of which are evident on the &quot;SuEcide&quot; EPs and the &quot;Limited Editions 1990-1994&quot; compilation). On creating DHR his solo recordings for that label consisted largely of the digital hardcore staples of breakcore (as heard on &quot;The Destroyer&quot; album and EPs) and later experimental noise (as heard on &quot;Miss Black America&quot;), while his work during the same period for Mille Plateaux saw him experimenting with minimal techno (&quot;Pulse Code&quot;), ambient (&quot;Low on Ice&quot;) and musique concrète (&quot;Les Étoiles des Filles Mortes&quot;). His alter-egos for various labels provided outlets for dabbling in other genres such as drum and bass/jungle (DJ Mowgly), Detroit techno (Jaguar) and even chiptune music (Nintendo Teenage Robots).

After the demise of Atari Teenage Riot, Empire&#x27;s major releases for DHR sought to continue in the guitar-based, punk-influenced vein of the band. &quot;Intelligence and Sacrifice&quot; utilised live guitars, breakbeats, noise, sampled cinematic dialogue and Empire&#x27;s trademark spoken/shouted English vocals, while &quot;Futurist&quot; saw a more obvious return to his punk roots and consequently sounds as if it were largely recorded using all live instrumentation, even though it was electronically produced. The creation of the Eat Your Heart Out label saw a move to a much more electronic-sounding approach with comparatively subdued vocals over synthesized sounds and beats.
