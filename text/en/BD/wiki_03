<text>Pampanga, officially the Province of Pampanga (; ; ), is a province in Central Luzon in the Philippines. Lying on the northern shore of Manila Bay, Pampanga is bordered by Tarlac to the north, Nueva Ecija to the northeast, Bulacan to the east, Manila Bay to the central-south, Bataan to the southwest and Zambales to the west. Its capital is the City of San Fernando, the regional center of Central Luzon. Angeles City is the largest LGU, but while geographically within Pampanga, it is classified as a first-class, highly urbanized city and has been governed independently of the province since it received its charter in 1964.

The name &quot;La Pampanga&quot; was given by the Spaniards, who encountered natives living along the banks (&quot;pampáng&quot;) of the Pampanga River. Its creation in 1571 makes it the first Spanish province on Luzon Island (Cebu in Visayas is older as it was founded by the Spaniards in 1565). The town of Villa de Bacolor in the province briefly served as the Spanish colonial capital when Great Britain invaded Manila as part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. At the eve of the Philippine Revolution of 1896, Pampanga was one of eight provinces placed under martial law for rebellion against the Spanish Empire; it is thus represented on the Philippine national flag as one of the eight rays of the sun.

Pampanga is served by Clark International Airport (formerly &quot;Diosdado Macapagal International Airport&quot;), which is in Clark Freeport Zone, some north of the provincial capital. The province is home to two Philippine Air Force airbases: Basa Air Base in Floridablanca and the former United States Clark Air Base in Angeles. Due to its growing population and developments, the Clark Global City is now developed and is located in Clark Freeport Zone. In 2015, the province had 2,198,110 inhabitants, while it had 1,079,532 registered voters.

==History==
=== Spanish colonial era ===

The territorial area of old Pampanga included portions of the modern provinces of Tarlac, Bataan, Zambales, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan and Aurora; i.e. covered almost the entire Central Luzon. When the Spanish arrived at Luzon, they found Pampanga to be thickly populated with several towns and that there were 3 castles or forts protecting Pampanga. Pampanga was re-organized as a province by the Spaniards on December 11, 1571. La Provincia de La Pampanga included areas mentioned above except Tondo, along with modern provinces of Aurora and parts of Quezon (including Polillo Islands) and Rizal (Pampanga also included portions of Metro Manila, which are Novaliches and Valenzuela to be exact, which was formerly known as Polo, then towns in Bulacan). For better administration and taxation purposes, the Spanish authorities subdivided Pampanga into &quot;pueblos&quot;, which were further subdivided into districts (&quot;barrios&quot;) and in some cases into royal and private estates (&quot;encomiendas&quot;).

Due to excessive abuses committed by some &quot;encomenderos&quot;, King Philip II of Spain in 1574 prohibited the further awarding of private estates, but this decree was not fully enforced until 1620. In a report of Philippine encomiendas on June 20, 1591, Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas reported to the Crown that La Pampanga&#x27;s encomiendas were Bataan, Betis y Lubao, Macabebe, Candaba, Apalit, Calumpit, Malolos, Binto, Guiguinto, Caluya, Bulacan and Mecabayan. The encomiendas of La Pampanga at that time had eighteen thousand six hundred and eighty whole tributes.

Pampanga, which is about in area and inhabited by more than 1.5 million people, had its present borders drawn in 1873. During the Spanish regime, it was one of the richest Philippine provinces. Manila and its surrounding region were then primarily dependent on Kapampangan agricultural, fishery and forestry products as well as on the supply of skilled workers. As other Luzon provinces were created due to increases in population, some well-established Pampanga towns were lost to new emerging provinces in Central Luzon.

During the 17th century, The Dutch recruited men from Pampanga as mercenaries who served the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, known as Papangers part of the larger Mardijkers community. Their legacy can be found in North Jakarta, however, there are few traces of their descendants, except for a small community in Kampung Tugu.

The historic province of Bataan which was founded in 1754 under the administration of Spanish Governor-General Pedro Manuel Arandia, absorbed from the province of Pampanga the municipalities of Abucay, Balanga (now a city), Dinalupihan, Llana Hermosa, Orani, Orion, Pilar, and Samal. During the British occupation of Manila (1762–1764), Bacolor became the provisional Spanish colonial capital and military base. By the end of the 1700s, Pampanga had 16,604 native families and 2,641 Spanish Filipino families, and 870 Chinese Filipino families.

The old Pampanga towns of Aliaga, Cabiao, Gapan, San Antonio and San Isidro were ceded to the province of Nueva Ecija in 1848 during the term of Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria y Zaldua. The municipality of &quot;San Miguel de Mayumo&quot; of Pampanga was yielded to the province of Bulacan in the same provincial boundary configuration in 1848.

In 1860, the northern towns of Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac and Floridablanca were separated from Pampanga and were placed under the jurisdiction of a military command called &quot;Comandancia Militar de Tarlac&quot;. However, in 1873, the four latter towns were returned to Pampanga and the other five became municipalities of the newly created Province of Tarlac.

=== Japanese invasion era ===
On December 8, 1941, Japanese planes bombed Clark Air Base marking the beginning of the invasion of Pampanga. Between 1941 and 1942, occupying Japanese forces began entering Pampanga.

During the counter-insurgencies under the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1944, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas fought side by side in the province of Pampanga, attacking and retreating the Japanese Imperial forces for over three years of fighting and invasion.

The establishment of the military general headquarters and military camp bases of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from 1935 to 1946. The Philippine Constabulary was active from 1935 to 1942 and 1944 to 1946 in the province of Pampanga. During the military engagements of the anti-Japanese Imperial military operations in central Luzon from 1942 to 1945 in the province of Bataan, Bulacan, Northern Tayabas (now Aurora), Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, and Zambales, the local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas, helped the U.S. military forces fight the Imperial Japanese armed forces.

In the 1945 liberation of Pampanga, Kapampangan guerrilla fighters and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas supported combat forces from Filipino and American ground troops in attacking Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga until the end of the Second World War. Local military operations soldiers and officers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 2nd, 26th, 3rd, 32nd, 33rd, 35th, 36th and 37th Infantry Division and the Philippine Constabulary 3rd Constabulary Regiment recaptured and liberated the province of Pampanga and fought against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Battle of Pampanga.

=== Postwar Era ===
After the Second World War, operations in the main province of Pampanga was downfall insurgencies and conflicts between the Philippine Government forces and the Hukbalahap Communist rebels on 1946 to 1954 during the Hukbalahap Rebellion.

Under a 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the Philippines granted the United States a 99-year lease on several U.S. bases, including Clark Air Base. A later amendment in 1966 reduced the original 99-year term of the agreement to 25 years. A renewal of the agreement in 1979 allowed the U.S. to continue operating Clark Air Base until November 1991, when the Philippine Senate rejected a bill for the renewal of U.S. bases in the Philippines.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
Due to its proximity to the capital and the presence of Clark Air Base, Pampanga was became one of the flashpoint of social upheavals of the early 1970s, and the ensuing dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. Even during the first demonstrations of the First Quarter Storm in 1970, Clark and the other US Bases in the Philippines were a major issue for protesters, who saw them as a continuation of the US&#x27; colonial hegemony, and a way of dragging the Philippines into the cold war, since Clark had become a staging point for the increasingly unpopular Vietnam War.

Upon the declaration of Martial Law in September 1972, Camp Olivas in the City of San Fernando was designated as one of the four provincial camps to become a Regional Command for Detainees (RECAD). It was designated RECAD I and it housed detainees from Northern and Central Luzon. Prominent detainees imprisoned there include Edicio de la Torre, Judy Taguiwalo, Tina Pargas, Marie Hilao-Enriquez, and Bernard-Adan Ebuen. Prisoners who were documented to have been tortured include the sisters Joanna and Josefina Cariño, the brothers Romulo and Armando Palabay, and Mariano Giner Jr of Abra. About 50 Kalinga and Bontoc leaders, including Butbut tribe leader Macli-ing Dulag, were also brought to Camp Olivas from their detainment center in Tabuk, Kalinga, arrested for their opposition to the Chico River Dam Project.

Others were killed without being arrested, such as close friends Pepito Deheran, Rolando Castro and Lito Cabrera were sleeping in Cabrera&#x27;s property in Sapang Bato, Angeles when they were attacked, captured, and tortured by Marcos&#x27; Civilian Home Defense Force militia forces after they participated in the protest movement that grew out of the assassination of opposition leader Ninoy Aquino. Deheran managed to escape the ordeal alive and was taken to the hospital, but was stabbed by unknown assailants in his own hospital bed.

Jennifer Cariño, the Palabay brothers, Macli-ing Dulag, Castro, Cabrera, and Deheran would later be honored by having their names inscribed on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which honors the martyrs and heroes who dared to resist the dictatorship.

=== Mount Pinatubo eruption and closure of Clark Air Base ===

Major events that took place in Pampanga after the People Power revolution include the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the end of the Philippines&#x27; Bases Treaty with the United States, which resulted in the closure of Clark Air Base and the later creation of the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone.

The June 15, 1991, eruption of Mount Pinatubo displaced a large number of people with the submersion of whole towns and villages by massive lahar floods. This led to a large-scale advancement in disaster preparation in government. It also hastened the closure of Clark Air Base, which would close as a result of the November 1991 decision of the Philippine senate not to renew the Philippines&#x27; Bases treaty with the United States.

=== Creation of the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone ===

1992 saw the signing of the Bases Conversion and Development Act (Republic Act 7227 ser. 1992), which authorized the President to issue a decree converting the military reservation in the Clark area covering Angeles City, Mabalacat, and Porac, Pampanga and Capas, Tarlac into a special economic zone. The legislation also created the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) to facilitate the conversion process. President Fidel Ramos issued Proclamation No. 163 on April 3, 1993, creating the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) and transferring the administration of the area to the BCDA. The proclamation included the Clark Air Base and portions of the Clark reverted baselands not reserved for military use to the CSEZ. On June 14, 1996, the CSEZ was expanded with the addition of the Sacobia area, which includes lands from Mabalacat, Pampanga and Bamban, Tarlac, through Ramos&#x27; Proclamation No. 805.

The Clark Air Base area would later be declared a Freeport Zone and was separated from the special economic zone through Republic Act 9400 of 2007 Since then the Freeport Zone and the Clark Special Economic Zone were considered as separate areas but collectively they are referred to as the &quot;Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone&quot;.

=== Contemporary ===
In 2010, a Kapampangan, Benigno Aquino III, son of former President Corazon Aquino, was elected as president.

On April 22, 2019, the province suffered severe damage due to 6.1 magnitude earthquake which originated from Zambales and was the most affected area by the earthquake due to province sitting on soft sediment and alluvial soil. Several structures in the province were damaged by the quake, including a 4-story supermarket in Porac, the Bataan-Pampanga boundary arch and the main terminal of Clark International Airport, as well as old churches in Lubao and Porac, where the stone bell tower of the 19th-century Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church collapsed.

<text>The Wests Tigers is an Australian professional rugby league football team, based in the Inner West of Sydney and South Western Sydney. The Tigers have competed in the National Rugby League (NRL) since being formed at the end of the 1999 NRL season as a joint-venture club between the Balmain Tigers and the Western Suburbs Magpies. 
The Wests Tigers started playing in the 2000 NRL season and they won their maiden premiership in 2005. The club also won the final edition of the World Sevens in 2004. The club has only qualified for three finals series since their inception (2005, 2010 and 2011).

The Wests Tigers play home games at two grounds: Leichhardt Oval (the home ground of Balmain) and Campbelltown Stadium (the home ground of Western Suburbs). They are currently coached by Benji Marshall. The club CEO is Shane Richardson.

==History==
===Background===
In Australia, the game of rugby league began in 1908; the New South Wales Rugby League premiership (NSWRL) had nine teams from the Sydney area. Two of those teams were clubs based in Balmain and the Western Suburbs who happened to meet each other in round 1 of 1908. Balmain won, 24 to 0. The Balmain club, who later adopted a Tiger as their emblem, in their tenure in the NSWRL won eleven premierships in twenty grand finals and was one of the forces in the NSWRL competition. However their last premiership success was in 1969 and in the 1990s with many new clubs being established, there was pressure on clubs to perform to survive in the first grade competition in Australia. The name Wests Tigers is derived from the nickname of the Western Suburbs Magpies and the mascot, a tiger, which was also the mascot of Balmain.

The Western Suburbs club won four premierships in twelve grand finals over the tenure of the NSWRL competition. The Western Suburbs Magpies, like the Balmain Tigers, had a dismal 1990s winning rate, and again there was pressure on the foundation clubs to perform. The NSWRL competition was replaced by the Australian Rugby League competition (ARL) in 1995 due to the expansion of rugby league within Australia.

With a media-driven rival competition being set up, the pressure was for clubs to survive and preserve their short-term future. Both the Magpies and the Tigers signed with the ARL, whereas eight clubs of the 1995 ARL competition signed with the rival Super League competition for 1997. In 1998, the ARL and Super League were unified into a National Rugby League (NRL) competition. As part of the deal with the ARL and Super League, the NRL competition reduced to fourteen teams in 2000 from the twenty two that had competition in both competitions in 1997. With the addition of a team in 1998, this meant that nine teams would be forced out before the 2000 season.

===Foundation===
With the NRL offering guaranteed entrance into the 2000 competition and A$6 million funding for clubs that merged, many clubs that were struggling to compete negotiated to merge. Balmain had garnered interest to merge with the Parramatta Eels and Gold Coast Chargers while Western Suburbs had talked with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and Penrith Panthers. Both Balmain and Western Suburbs felt that those offers were seen more as takeovers of their clubs rather than mergers. By June 1999, both clubs&#x27; boards had unanimously voted to form a joint-venture partnership with each other to make a competitive entity.

One hundred shares were issued to Balmain Tigers Rugby League Football Club and 100 shares were issued to Western Suburbs Rugby League Football Group Pty Limited as a 50/50-owned joint venture. Due to Western Suburbs&#x27;s record-breaking dismal season in 1999, they supplied just six of the twenty-five players to the new joint venture. A board of directors was appointed with five sourced from Balmain, five sourced from Western Suburbs, with a rotating chairman serving a one-year appointment. The inaugural chairman of the joint venture was John Chalk, who was previously involved with Balmain Tigers, and Steve Noyce was appointed CEO.

==Playing seasons==
===Coach Wayne Pearce 2000===
Balmain coach Wayne Pearce was the initial coach of the Wests Tigers and new recruit Jarrod McCracken was named captain. Before the first round, the Tigers were denied a place in the double header at Stadium Australia. The debut match for the team was therefore held at Campbelltown, against eventual premiers the Brisbane Broncos, where after leading 18–6 the team snatched a 24-all draw after falling behind late in the game. John Skandalis scored the Tigers&#x27; first ever try.

The Tigers surprised many by maintaining a high place on the ladder for most of the year (often in second place). Losses to the Penrith Panthers (after leading 31–8) and in the snow against the Canberra Raiders combined with injuries to key players saw the Tigers slide out of the top eight.
The loss of captain Jarrod McCracken from a spear tackle against Melbourne was a crucial blow.

A highlight of their first season is that Wests&#x27; Joel Caine claimed the 2000 NRL season&#x27;s top point-scorer spot.

===Coach Terry Lamb 2001–2002===
2001 was a tough season for the joint venture club, including off-field incidents. After Wayne Pearce announced he would no longer coach the team, Terry Lamb was appointed to the position. This was a controversial selection because of animosity from Balmain supporters due to an incident involving Ellery Hanley in the 1988 Grand Final (see Terry Lamb entry for more information).

Early in the season, key players Craig Field and Kevin McGuinness tested positive to prohibited drugs and both received a one-year suspension. Field was the team&#x27;s halfback and playmaker while McGuinness was a leading try scorer for the club.

Later in the season another big name player was suspended: John Hopoate earned worldwide notoriety when he was charged with inserting his finger into the anus (pushing the players&#x27; shorts) of opposition players. Hopoate quit the club and received a long suspension. Lamb was criticised for seeming to condone the activity.

During the season the club announced Terry Lamb would not have his contract renewed. The team struggled near the foot of the ladder and only a large victory over Souths moved them clear of the wooden spoon position.

The coaching job for 2003 was offered to (and rejected by) both Craig Bellamy and Ian Millward before Tim Sheens was selected. The selection was by no means seen as a positive move by the media as Sheens&#x27; most recent coaching stint had seen him sacked by the North Queensland Cowboys.

===Coach Tim Sheens 2003–2012===
The 2003 season was notable for the emergence of new young players through the team as the club moved away from the era of big names and big money signings and focused on developing junior talent. Most notably Benji Marshall, then a schoolboy prodigy with no senior league experience, made his debut against the Newcastle Knights.

The Tigers improved greatly in 2004 with provided help by signings of players such as Brett Hodgson and Pat Richards who began to blend well with the younger players emerging as talents. The Tigers narrowly missed the playoffs after losing their final three games when a single victory would have guaranteed finals football for the first time.

====Premiership success ====
2005 was arguably the Wests Tigers&#x27; best season as of their foundation, as they not only made it to the finals for the first time, but also reached the top four in the round robin part of the competition, setting crowd attendance records at three different grounds: Campbelltown Stadium (20,527), Telstra Stadium (29,542) and Leichhardt Oval (22,877).

After a slow start, bookmakers rated the Tigers a 150–1 chance to win the premiership. However the club emerged from the bottom half of the table to win a club-record eight in a row before finishing fourth. The team developed a reputation as a flamboyant attacking team who played at a rapid pace to compensate a lack of forward size.

The Tigers played their first ever final as a joint venture club at Telstra Stadium against North Queensland Cowboys. Backed by a passionate crowd the team won 50–6. They then beat the Brisbane Broncos 34–6 and premiership favourites St. George Illawarra Dragons 20–12 to book a spot against North Queensland.

Based on their winning form (they had won 11 of their last 13) and their big win over the Cowboys in the opening finals game, the Wests Tigers were rated favourites to win the 2005 grand final. After a slow start, Bryce Gibbs and Pat Richards scored tries to give the Tigers a 12–6 lead. The Richards try was ranked the second best try of all time in the NRL&#x27;s Centenary of Rugby League 100 Hot Tries survey. The try was started by five-eighth Benji Marshall, who received the ball from Brett Hodgson (after receiving a down field kick) 98 metres from the opposition tryline. He beat Cowboys five-eighth Johnathan Thurston and Matt Sing. Marshall then ran 60 metres, only to be caught by Cowboys fullback Matt Bowen. He made a flick pass to Pat Richards behind his back, who then fended off Rod Jensen to score.

In the second half the Tigers gained control with tries to Anthony Laffranchi and Daniel Fitzhenry. After withstanding a Cowboys fightback, a Todd Payten try on full-time sealed a 30–16 win. Captain Scott Prince was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for 2005.

The premiership victory meant that the club joined an exclusive group that won premierships in their first finals appearance, which had not been achieved in almost 100 years. The group also includes Souths in 1908 and Newtown in 1910.

At the end of the 2005 season, Wests also signed Malaysian car manufacturer Proton as its major new sponsor on a contract estimated to be worth more than $1 million.

====Post grand final failure====
Following the premiership win several key players left the club. From the grand final team, Mark O&#x27;Neill, and Pat Richards signed with English clubs (Leeds Rhinos and Wigan Warriors respectively). New signings included Jamaal Lolesi (Bulldogs), Keith Galloway (Cronulla Sharks) and Ryan O&#x27;Hara (Canberra Raiders).

As defending premiers, the Wests Tigers began the season by travelling to England to play English Super League champions the Bradford Bulls. Missing many of their star players, the Tigers tried hard but were eventually beaten 10–30. After a come from behind win over competition heavyweights St George-Illawarra, the team struggled with injuries to key players. Most notably Benji Marshall and Brett Hodgson missed large portions of the season. The team suffered a number of narrow losses late in games and also two golden point (extra time) matches in controversial circumstances.

The Wests Tigers narrowly missed the finals and the chance to defend their title. One highlight of the season was the debut of several players including Chris Lawrence and the emergence of up and coming players such as Dean Collis. Brett Hodgson played for the New South Wales team in the interstate State of Origin series in all three games. Another highlight was an upset win over eventual premiers the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium where a second-string Tigers team missing Hodgson, Marshall, Whatuira and Gibbs beat the more experienced Broncos 20–6.

Joining the club for the 2007 season was John Morris (ex Parramatta Eels) to replace Scott Prince who signed with the Gold Coast Titans. Other players to leave at the end of the 2006 season were John Skandalis, Anthony Laffranchi and Shane Elford – all members of the 2005 grand final team.

The Wests Tigers had a bad start to the season losing their opening four games by narrow margins. They then had a six-game winning streak to move into the top four. The Tigers&#x27; five-eighth Benji Marshall and full-back Brett Hodgson missed the majority of the season with injuries.

The Wests Tigers ended their attempt at a finals berth and finished the season on a loss to the Newcastle Knights, 26–24, at the then-Telstra Stadium.

The following two seasons ended in the same fashion with the Tigers missing out on the finals narrowly in 2008 and 2009 finishing 10th and 9th.

In February 2008, the Wests Tigers announced the extension of Benji Marshall&#x27;s contract by one year, to the end of 2009. They also announced the signing of Gareth Ellis, the Leeds Rhinos second-rower and international representative, to a three-year deal commencing in 2009.

On an administrative level, in April 2008, CEO Steve Noyce announced he was standing down from his role and was eventually replaced by Scott Longmuir at the end of the 2008 season.

====Continued off-field troubles====

Following the appointment of Scott Longmuir as CEO, there were rumours that Scott and then coach Sheens did not see eye to eye. Longmuir was aligned with then chair of the board Kevin Hammond (from the Wests side of the JV) in wanting Sheens to focus on the football, and for the office of the CEO to run the club as a business. At the time the financial backing from the three leagues clubs was very minimal, and Longmuir attempted to modernise the management of the club. However, with a majority of the board backing Sheens, Longmuir was eventually removed from his role in April 2009.

On 14 April 2009, Tim Camiler (CEO Balmain Leagues Club) and Andy Timbs (General Manager Wests Ashfield Leagues Club) were appointed temporary joint CEO&#x27;s of the football club

In June 2009, Stephen Humphreys was announced as the new CEO, beginning his role in July. Humphreys was a lifelong Balmain Tigers fan, with the appointment brokered by ex-Balmain player, Benny Elias. His first major decision was to ensure continuity on the pitch, maintaining Tim Sheens as Head Coach of the football club.

====Return to finals football====
In February 2010, the Wests Tigers announced the signing of former Rugby Union star Lote Tuqiri for three years, and the signing of Benji Marshall for a further five.

In 2010 the club finished third in the minor premiership competition, narrowly missing out on a grand final spot after losing to eventual premiers St. George Illawarra Dragons in the preliminary final by one point.

At the end of 2010, it was announced that Meriton had signed a 2-year agreement to become major shirt and club sponsor for the 2011 and 2012 season. This placed the large M logo on the Wests Tigers redesigned shirts for 2 years

2011 was another successful season with the Tigers finishing 4th and making the semi-finals yet again, where they were defeated by a late try to the New Zealand Warriors in a loss.

====Form slump====
Despite being backed as premiership favourites at the start of the season, the Tigers failed to qualify for the finals in the 2012 season finishing 10th.
On 25 September 2012, in a press conference CEO Stephen Humphreys and Chairman Dave Trodden announced that Tim Sheens would not be the head coach in 2013 in a restructuring of the club. This came a week after the loss of long-term players Beau Ryan and Chris Heighington to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for the 2013 season, and a poor 2012 season on the field. Heighington had one year on his contract left while a handshake deal with Ryan had been made back in February.

===Coach Mick Potter 2013–2014===
At the end of the 2012 season, Mick Potter was given the head coaching job on a two-year deal to help rebuild the club.

Success was far from achieved with the Tigers missing out on the finals in the 2013 and 2014 seasons finishing 15th and 13th respectively.

In further upheaval at the club, CEO Stephen Humphreys stepped down from his role in May 2013, with continued boardroom issues cited as a major factor.

In June 2013 Wests Campbelltown sold their shares in the joint venture to Wests Ashfield Leagues, and pulled out of the joint venture. This sale left Balmain Leagues Club and Wests Ashfield Leagues club with 100 shares each in the joint venture

On 26 July, the club announced Grant Meyer had been appointed as CEO

During this period Benji Marshall announced his decision to leave the club at the end of 2013, and signed a deal to play rugby union in New Zealand

The 2014 season was another poor season for the Wests Tigers and there was growing unrest from the club and fans about the results under Mick Potter.

Subsequently, following a mid year and end review by Meyer, Mick Potter did not have his coaching contract renewed, with the club issuing a press release confirming his release in September 2014. Potter finished his tenure at the club with a record of 17 wins and 31 losses.

====Off-field restructure – 2014====
In September 2014, with the ongoing financial troubles at Balmain Leagues Club (who by this stage had defaulted on payments to the Wests Tigers) a new shareholder agreement was put into place with the supervision of the NRL. A new seven-person board was nominated with two from Balmain Tigers, two from Wests Leagues and three independents. A new NRL deed was issued along with a new Wests Tigers constitution being drawn up. Mike Bailey continued as chairman of the board of Wests Tigers.

The proposed 7-person board was never ratified, and a reduced board of five was approved by the NRL.

As at 5 September 2014, Wests Tigers Board of Directors consisted of the following:

Marina Go – Chairperson (Independent NRL Appointment),Tony Andreacchio - (Wests Ashfield Leagues Board Member), Simon Cook - (Wests Ashfield Leagues CEO), Lucio Bartololeo - (Independent NRL Appointment), Rosemary Sinclair - (Independent NRL Appointment)

Balmain Leagues Club had no appointed directors due to the club moving into funding default, and were termed &quot;unfinancial shareholders&quot;. Balmain were in debt to the NRL to a sum of nearly AU$5 million, which was due to be repaid on 16 March 2016. At the time, it was announced that should Balmain Leagues Club fail to repay the loan, the shares would be considered &quot;in default&quot; and would be placed for sale. The agreement was made that Wests Ashfield Leagues Club would be offered first call to buy all the shares, pay off the NRL debts and become sole owner. If Wests Ashfield declined, the shares could be offered for general sale.

One of the first tasks for the board was to appoint a new club coach. The club moved to appoint Jason Taylor (who had played for Western Suburbs between 1990 and 1993) on 29 September 2014 for the oncoming 2015 season, following guidance of CEO Meyer, and supported by Chair Go. Phil Moss also joined the club as general manager of football operations at the same time.

===Coach Jason Taylor 2015–2017===
Jason Taylor began the new season with Robbie Farah as captain. The first game of the season started off vs the Gold Coast Titans. A far from convincing performance gave the Tigers a one-point field goal victory coming from the boot of Pat Richards. The season ended with Wests Tigers 15th on the ladder sharing 20 points with the Knights, with Tigers goal difference preventing the wooden spoon.

Off the pitch politics continued through the year with ownership issues still dominating headlines for the football club, with the NRL maintaining its financial interest in the club given the poor state of affairs at Balmain Leagues Club. Adding to the troubles at the club, CEO Grant Meyer tendered his resignation on 15 June 2015

The club also made headlines with rumours and stories that the club coach and captain were in difference of opinion about how the team should be playing. In August 2015 the club made a statement on their website announcing that Farah had been given permission to speak with other football clubs for the 2016 season.

The new club CEO was announced on 4 September 2015 with Justin Pascoe, previously at Penrith Panthers, appointed to the role.

September 2015 also saw the announcement of a three-year sponsorship agreement with Brydens Lawyers. The three-year multimillion-dollar deal was the largest in the club&#x27;s history and saw Brydens logo on the front and sleeve of the Wests Tigers jerseys.

The 2016 season started off with Aaron Woods replacing Robbie Farah as club captain, and the club made a promising start to the season with home wins against New Zealand Warriors and Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. A string of losses including a 60 points to 6 loss against the Canberra Raiders left the club struggling at the lower end of the table. Off field, the drama surrounding Robbie Farah continued with speculation that he would leave the club by the end of the season.

After a string of mixed results, including two wins against rivals South Sydney, but a poor loss to Newcastle left Wests Tigers 9th on the ladder, a point away from the top 8 at the end of the full season.

The end of the season also saw the Robbie Farah saga concluded, with Farah penning a two-year deal with South Sydney Rabbitohs. Robbie left the club having played 247 games and scoring 61 tries.

In April 2017, the &quot;Big Four&quot; story began from the media after there were reports Mitchell Moses, James Tedesco, Aaron Woods and Luke Brooks had all been looking to leave the club over issues with the salary cap and uncertainty with the playing roster heading into 2018. The four players were also reportedly not willing to continue playing with the club if Jason Taylor remained as head coach. Brooks would later sign a two-year contract extension whilst Moses, Woods and Tedesco would all depart the club with Moses being granted a mid-season release to Parramatta. Early in the 2017 season, after a pair of heavy defeats to the Penrith Panthers and Canberra Raiders, Taylor was dismissed from his position as head coach.

Assistant Coach Andrew Webster was appointed as caretaker manager whilst the CEO and board recruited a new full-time replacement.

====Off-field restructure and new ownership – 2016====
2016 also had its watershed moment with the ownership of the football club finally resolved. On 5 May 2016 the club released a statement announcing the restructure of the football club

In an $8.5 million deal, Wests Ashfield Leagues Club assumed majority ownership of the football franchise. As the press statement read &quot;The ownership structure sees Wests move to 75% ownership with Balmain retaining 25% and the Board expanded to nine directors&quot;. Wests Ashfield Leagues Club (and by relationship Wests Magpies) has settled all debts owed to the NRL by the Wests Tigers Football club. Balmain Tigers Leagues Club in a separate financial agreement had an outstanding loan and debt to NRL. Wests Ashfield Leagues Club were guarantors of that loan. Note that the loan was not secured against the Wests Tigers Football Club.

The new board had five members appointed from Wests Ashfield, two from Balmain along with two independents.

===Coach Ivan Cleary 2017–2018===
After a week of rumours in the press on 3 April 2017, it was announced that Ivan Cleary had accepted the role of coach through to the end of the 2020 season with immediate effect, at a press conference held at Wests Ashfield Leagues Club.

During a press conference with Coach Cleary late on in April, a single near throwaway comment was made by Ivan about how he approached his first meeting with the players. He said to the press &quot;I told the players you are either on the bus, or you are off it&quot;. This one line became a marketing slogan used through his tenure as coach and the &quot;On The Bus&quot; slogan became used by fans and media alike.

2017 turned out to be a poor one for Wests Tigers on the field with The NRL team finishing in 14th spot, The Under 20s Holden Cup team finishing 2nd to last and The NSW Cup team finishing with the wooden spoon.

In the 2018 NRL season, Wests started off the year with impressive wins over the Sydney Roosters and Melbourne before a mid season slump saw the club only winning 3 out of 10 games between Round 10 and Round 20. Wests would end up finishing in 9th position on the table missing the finals. Their final game of the year was a 51–10 loss against the South Sydney Rabbitohs.

Towards the end of the season, rumours and news swirled around the press and media about Ivan Cleary leaving the Wests Tigers to return to Penrith Panthers.

On 28 October 2018, Wests released coach Ivan Cleary from the final two years of his contract. Cleary also sent a departing text message to the tigers playing group saying &quot;G&#x27;day boys I hope this finds you well and enjoying your time off, I was writing to you in the hope of beating the press.. to let you know that I will no longer be your coach at Wests Tigers. This is an extremely uncomfortable situation for me as I have genuine fondness for the club, and I have loved coaching you all.. I understand that this situation has caused some pain for people that I care about, along with putting the club in an awkward situation... I do not feel good about this. I would have preferred to do this in person but time and circumstances have made that impossible. I hope we meet again soon and I wish you all the very best in the future. You have my number and I am always open for a chat if you wish. Iv&quot;.

===Coach Michael Maguire 2019-2022===
With the signs that Cleary was leaving the club, a search was underway for his replacement. The same day the club announced Cleary&#x27;s departure Michael Maguire was announced as coach through to the end of 2021. One of Michael Maguires early decisions at the club following the Christmas break was to remove the &quot;co-captain&quot; arrangement and appoint Moses Mbye as the club&#x27;s sole and only captain.

Under the guidance of Maguire, Wests Tigers football club has changed the team&#x27;s slogan. &quot;On the Bus&quot; was replaced with &quot;This is Our Jungle&quot; for the 2019 season.

====Salary cap breaches====
On 19 December 2018 the NRL Integrity Unit under the guidance of the NRL CEO Todd Greenburg announced the Wests Tigers had been found to have fraudulently and intentionally breached the NRL Salary Cap. Greenburg announced that when playmaker Robbie Farah was released to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2016, CEO Justin Pascoe had offered to employ Farah back at the club on his retirement from football in return for Robbie agreeing to leave without incident. Despite Farah never accepting this position, and despite this story being broadcast in the media at the time, the NRL Integrity Unit decided that this offer was a sufficient incentive for Robbie to leave, it should have been formally lodged with the NRL. This was constituted a serious breach of the salary cap. The football club was fined $750,000, include the alleged salary offered to Robbie of $639,000 to the 2019 salary cap and CEO Pascoe was advised it was the intention of the NRL to de-register the experienced sports administrator from ever managing a club in the NRL.

The football club appealed this decision, and on 1 March 2019 the NRL backtracked on the position from December 2018 and halved the fine to $350,000, allowed the club to split the $639,000 of the cap breach over seasons 2019 and 2020 and CEO Justin Pascoe would be stood down for 6 months only (backdated to the original date of 19 December 2018).

In the interim, Wests Ashfield CEO, Simon Cook, assumed the role of interim CEO at the football club, and temporarily stood down from his position on the football club board. Head of Football Kelly Egan left the club prior to Pascoe&#x27;s return as did chairman Marino Go and Chief Operating Officer Ryan Webb.

Justin Pascoe was re-instated back to his role as CEO on 26 June 2019

====Change of chair of the board====
On 12 March 2019 the club announced to the media and press that former NSW State premier Barry O&#x27;Farrell had been appointed as chair of the board of directors, replacing Marina Go, who had come to the end of her tenure.

====Season 2019====
The 2019 NRL season began with the knowledge that the club would take occupancy in the newly constructed Western Sydney Stadium in Parramatta. Four home games were allocated to this exciting new venue. The opening game of the season was played in wet conditions at Leichhardt Oval in front of 13,000 fans, with the team victors 20–6 against a poor Manly Warringah Sea Eagles team. A second round win against the free running New Zealand Warriors a week later in front of nearly 10,000 fans in Campbelltown again in wet conditions was a good start to the season. In round 6 against the Parramatta Eels, Wests played in the first NRL game at the new Western Sydney Stadium which ended in the club losing 51–6.

Wests Tigers took another &quot;home&quot; game on the road in 2019, with a match hosted in Scully Park in Tamworth. Nearly 10,000 fans turned out to watch Wests run out 30–14 victors over lower placed Gold Coast Titans.

The first home game of the season at the newly named BankWest stadium was held on Friday 7 June against the Canberra Raiders. The 0–28 result in front of 12,000 supporters lent some fans to make the comment &quot;This is not our jungle&quot;.

Wests Tigers playmaker, Benji Marshall, played his 300th game in the NRL on 14 July at BankWest stadium in front of more than 25,000 fans. Wests lost the game 30–18 against the Parramatta Eels.

In round 25 against Cronulla-Sutherland, Wests went into the game knowing that whoever won the match would be guaranteed a finals spot as both teams came into the last game of the year on equal points. Wests would end up losing the match 25–8 at a packed Leichhardt Oval which was also retiring Robbie Farah&#x27;s final game. The loss also meant that this was the sixth time that Wests had finished ninth since the joint venture started in 2000.

====Change of chair of the board====

On 13 November 2019 the club announced Lee Hagipantelis had been appointed chair of the board of the football club. Whilst Mr O&#x27;Farrell had only been with the club for a short while, he resigned his post to take up the position of ambassador to India for Australia.

Lee Hagipantelis is the Principal of Wests Tigers shirt sponsor, Brydens Lawyers.

====Season 2020====
The new season was kicked off with an away game against St. George Illawarra at WIN Stadium in Wollongong. Wests Tigers ran out 24-14 victors against the Red V. The season was interrupted with the global pandemic COVID-19 following the opening round, with all games being placed on hiatus.

When the shortened NRL season recommenced, all games were played initially behind closed doors. Wests played six matches with no fans able to visit the stadia to watch the games. Fans were re-admitted in limited numbers in round 8 with Wests Tigers losing to Penrith in front of 5000 fans at Bankwest Stadium.

2020 wasn&#x27;t a great year for the club on the pitch, eventually fading away to 11th position, with only seven wins and thirteen losses. The club also set a new unwanted record being the first side since the competition began in 1908 to concede 24 points or more in a game for ten consecutive matches.

On 18 August Chris Lawrence announced he would be retiring from the Wests Tigers and from Rugby League as a player. Lawrence retired having played 253 games for the club, and having scored 84 tries

On 1 September the club announced that Benji Marshall would not be playing on into 2021. This announcement was seen by many fans as deplorable and a petition soon garnered almost 10,000 signatures by fans, with Benji later claiming that he heard about this news via the press, not from the club. Marshall left the club having played 257 games over two stints at the club scoring 84 tries.

====Player swap 2020====
The 2020 NRL season at Wests Tigers was also memorable for the first of its kind &quot;player swap&quot;. Melbourne hooker Harry Grant and Wests Tigers centre, Paul Momirovski swapped club&#x27;s for the 2020 season. The deal, brokered by Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy and Wests coach Michael Maguire, was the first of its kind within the NRL modern era game. The two players swapped playing clubs for the remainder of the 2020 NRL season.

====Share ownership update====

On 2 October 2020 the Amalgamation of Wests Ashfield Leagues Club and Balmain Tigers Leagues Club was cemented. As per the Deed of Amalgamation, this changed the ownership structure of the club to effectively be 90% Wests Ashfield, 10% Balmain Tigers.

====Season 2021====

The 2021 NRL season opened with fresh hope for Wests Tigers fans. With a number of new signings at the club including Jimmy &quot;The Jet&quot; Roberts, and Daine Laurie in as fullback, the club moved Adam Doueihi to Number 6 to partner Luke Brooks in the halves, with Jacob Liddle coming in as hooker.

The first five rounds however were not a great success, with the club picking up only two points with a win over Newcastle. In round 4 of the 2021 NRL season against Parramatta at Stadium Australia, the match recorded the highest attendance at a Rugby League game so far in 2021 with an official attendance of 29,056.

In round 5 of the competition, there was a lot of emotion at Leichhardt Oval, with the club paying tribute following the death of Western Suburbs legend, Tommy Raudonikis. The #7 jersey was retired for the game in memoriam, with Luke Brooks running out in #22. The game itself was more known for the team being booed off by fans at half time, trailing the un-fancied North Queensland Cowboys 28–6. The game ended up 34–30 to North Queensland with Wests Tigers rallying in the second half.

April 2021 also saw a minor change to the board of directors of the football club, with Mick Liubinskas being replaced by Julie Romero. Like Mick, Julie was a nominee by Wests Ashfield Leagues Club, a director of that leagues club and a Wests Ashfield Debenture holder.

In round 9 of the 2021 NRL season, the club played at Campbelltown Sports Ground and they wore specially designed jerseys as part of a celebration into the life of Tommy Raudonikis OAM. The match ball was delivered onto the pitch by Tommy&#x27;s partner, Trish. Wests Tigers lost the game against the Gold Coast 36–28.

In June 2021, it was announced that Premiership winning coach, Tim Sheens, would be returning to the club in the capacity of Head of Football Performance focussing on pathways, development and talent identification.

The Wests Tigers finished the 2021 NRL season in 13th place after an awful season which saw them only win three times in the last eleven games. In the final round of the season, Wests were defeated 38-0 by Wooden Spooners Canterbury-Bankstown. After this point, there were talks that head coach Michael Maguire was to be terminated from his position but on 21 September it was announced he would be kept on as head coach for the 2022 season.

On the 15th October 2021, the club announced that general manager of football, Adam Hartigan, had left the club.

====Season 2022====
The 2022 NRL season began with key playmakers Adam Doueihi and Daine Laurie sidelined through injury, but with new signing Jackson Hastings moving into the number 7 position, with Luke Brooks shifting to 6. After 12 rounds heading into the bye round for the State of Origin series, Wests Tigers had only achieved three wins for the season so far. After much rumour in the press, on 7 June the football club announced the termination of head coach, Michael Maguire. 
Brett Kimmorley was then handed the role as interim head coach until the end of the season whilst the football club searched for a full time replacement. In round 23, the club was defeated 72-6 by the Sydney Roosters which made the loss the heaviest in the Wests Tigers history.
In round 24, Wests Tigers lost 24-22 against St. George Illawarra, the result meant that the club would finish bottom of the table and claim their first Wooden Spoon in club history.
The Wests Tigers lost their last game of the season 56-10 at Leichhardt Oval against the Canberra Raiders. The score was 42-0 at halftime.

===Coach Tim Sheens 2023===
Before the end of season 2022, the club announced that ex-head coach Tim Sheens was returning to the role of Head Coach of the beleaguered club. This was to be Tim Sheens second stint as head coach of the football club. It was announced he would start his new role at the commencement of the 2023 preseason.

====Coaching appointments====
The club was announced that Benji Marshall and Robbie Farah would be appointed to the coaching team for the following two seasons (2023 and 2024) and for Benji Marshall to take the reins of the club for season 2025 as head coach in his own right, with Tim Sheens to move back to his role as director of football.

====Season 2023====
The club started the 2023 NRL season as they did the year previously losing their opening five matches. They became the first club since Newtown in 1968 and 1969 to lose their first five matches in two consecutive seasons.
On 4 April 2023, the club came under criticism from fans and the media after they released a commemorative ANZAC jersey with a stock image of American soldiers on the front and back. The club then released a statement which read “As a club Wests Tigers is deeply sorry if the use of this image has in any way offended anyone, This was never our intention, and we are taking steps to rectify this&quot;.
In round 9, the Wests Tigers won their first match in 273 days as they upset back to back premiers Penrith 12-8.

Round 12 saw the Wests Tigers biggest win of the season, and signs of a recovery of the club, with a score of 66-18 against the North Queensland Cowboys, with a 100% conversion of all eleven tries.

The week following this match, the club announced that Joe Ofahengaue was leaving the club in a mid-season move to the Parramatta Eels.

In round 18, the club suffered the third biggest loss in Australian rugby league history losing 74-0 against North Queensland. It was also the biggest loss by any team of the NRL era. It came after just two months prior where the Wests Tigers defeated North Queensland 66-18.

On 16 August 2023, the Wests Tigers released a statement detailing how Tim Sheens had requested to stand down as head coach at the end of the season, with Benji Marshall to take over head coaching duties from 2024 rather than 2025 as originally planned. Wests Tigers chairman Lee Hagipantelis claimed in an interview with Fox Sports that the decision to fast-track Marshall to the head coaching role had been considered for some time due to him exceeding expectations in his role as Sheens&#x27; assistant coach.

During a game at Commbank Stadium, unhappy fans started to show their anger with the management of the club by unfurling a banner at the home game against the Dolphins aimed at the CEO Justin Pascoe. Further banners were unfurled by fans at the away game against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles at Brookvale Oval.

In round 26 of the 2023 NRL season, Wests Tigers finished with the Wooden Spoon for a second consecutive season after they lost 32-8 against the Sydney Roosters. Wests Tigers needed to win their remaining two matches to avoid finishing in last place. The Wests Tigers Jersey Flegg Cup team also finished with the Wooden Spoon in their respective competition which capped off a bad year for the club.

====Independent review====
On 15 September 2023 the club began a review of all football operations following the second wooden spoon. The review was conducted by former NRL chief financial officer Tony Crawford and managing director of Cooperage Capital Pty Ltd Gary Barnier. The club confirmed at the time no deadline had been set for the completion of the review.

Whilst the review had only started a few days earlier, it was publicised that Lee Hagipantellis had been re-appointed as an independent board member and chair of the board for a further three years 

On 28 September 2023 James Myatt resigned from the board of directors of the football club.

Only weeks after confirming Lee Hagipantellis was to remain as chair of the board, news broke that the director Tony Andreacchio had called Lee to request he stand down and resign as chair of the board.

====Appointment of new board and CEO====
On 12 December 2023 with the first phase of the independent review complete, the entire board of directors of the club was stood down, and the club CEO Justin Pascoe resigned his role. Shane Richardson (ex-Rabbitohs CEO) was appointed as the interim chief executive, whilst Barry O&#x27;Farrellformer Liberal leader and ex Premier of New South Wales, returned to the club as the interim chair of the board.

Two new board members, Danny Stapleton and David Gilbert, were appointed, representing shareholders Balmain Tigers RLFC and Holman Barnes Group respectively. (Later in 2024 David Gilbert was replaced by Stephen Montgomery)

===Coach Benji Marshall 2024–===
Prior to the end of the 2023 season, Benji Marshall, who had previously been the club&#x27;s assistant coach, was appointed as head coach from the commencement of pre-season training for season 2024.

One of the first appointments was adding John Morris as assistant and defensive coach for season 2024. Morris rejoined the club he played more than 70 games for, often playing alongside Marshall.
The club endured another tough campaign in the 2024 NRL season winning only six matches all year. At one stage, the club went through a nine-game losing streak. In round 27, the Wests Tigers had the chance of avoiding their third straight wooden spoon as they played against Parramatta in what was dubbed by the media as the &quot;Spoon Bowl&quot;. Wests would lose the match 60-26 which ensured they would finish with the wooden spoon for a third consecutive season.
It capped off a bad year for the club with the NSW Cup team Western Suburbs also finishing with the wooden spoon.

The shining light of the season was Shane Richardsons role as CEO being made permanent on a four-year deal to commence 2 July 2024 

==== New sponsors ====
Brydens Lawyers shirt and major club sponsorship expired at the end of season 2024, and the club revealed a new shirt sponsorship with Pepper Money, marking a further achievement of the largest sponsor deal in the clubs history. Real estate construction development company Pama also increased their sponsorship becoming the new sternum shirt sponsor for a 3 year term.

==== New Directors ====
Following on from the full club review, three new independant directors were appointed by the club: Charlie Viola (former partner at Pitcher Partners), Michelle McDowell (former MD of Allied Express) and Annabelle Williams OAM PLY (lawyer and former Paralympic gold medallist). 

At the first full board meeting on 28th January 2025, Barry O&#x27;Farrell was voted in as Chair of the Board on a full time basis

===Western Suburbs Leagues Club Ltd===

The group is the primary financial donor to the Wests Tigers rugby league franchise outside of the revenue provided by the NRL and coprtorate sponsorship. From 2014 Wests Ashfield was the only Leagues Club which directly subsidized the Wests Tigers Rugby League franchise.

These grounds are around 50 km apart and are in Magpie and Tiger territories respectively. Other home grounds include one &quot;home&quot; game a year at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane since 2019 for Magic Round. Previously the club has played home games at the Sydney Football Stadium and Accor Stadium. From 2019 to 2023 Wests Tigers took their home games to the brand new Commbank Stadium.

==Emblems and jerseys==

The club&#x27;s name and logo are a combination of the two partners. The uniform colours are a combination of the black and white of the Western Suburbs Magpies uniform and the black and gold from the Balmain Tigers uniform. The original logo combined a modern &quot;in your face&quot; Tiger with a traditional Wests &#x27;V&#x27; in the background. There is also a Magpie (taken from the Western Suburbs Logo) on both sleeves of the Jersey. In 2009, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the joint venture, a predominantly white strip with a gold &#x27;V&#x27; was unveiled.

Since formation, the Wests Tigers have mostly retained the same logo with subtle changes. In October 2021, Wests Tigers unveiled a simplified logo ahead of the 2022 NRL season, retaining the tiger head of previous emblems with fewer details. The rebranding is intended to make the identity more suitable to modern digital formats, and coincided with the Tigers&#x27; move to a new training and administration base.

==Supporters==
At the end of the 2023 NRL season, the club recorded 20,003 paying members which ranked the club with the sixth highest membership base out of the nine Sydney clubs.

Some notable supporters of the club include Russell Arnold, Jimmy Barnes, Ash Barty Tim Cahill, Michael Clarke, Vic Darchinyan, Anthony Field, Dawn Fraser, Daniel Geale, Julie Goodwin, Sam Konstas, Jimmy Little, Paul Murray, Barry O&#x27;Farrell, Dominic Perrottet, Jordan Thompson, and Harry Triguboff.

<text>The Great Western Railway 4000 or Star were a class of 4-cylinder 4-6-0 passenger steam locomotives designed by George Jackson Churchward for the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1906 and introduced from early 1907. The prototype was built as a 4-4-2 Atlantic (but converted to 4-6-0 during 1909). They proved to be a successful design which handled the heaviest long-distance express trains, reaching top speeds of 90 mph (145 km/h), and established the design principles for GWR 4-cylinder classes over the next twenty-five years.

==Background==
After finally converting the last broad gauge lines in 1892, the GWR began a period of modernisation as new cut-off lines shortened its routes to west of England, South Wales and Birmingham. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the new Chief Mechanical Engineer, George Jackson Churchward designed or acquired a number of experimental locomotives with different wheel arrangements and boiler designs to help him plan for the future motive power needs of the railway. Following the success of the prototypes of his two-cylinder Saint class 4-6-0 locomotives, introduced in 1902, Churchward became interested in developing a more powerful 4-cylinder type for the longer non-stop express services. He therefore persuaded the GWR to acquire three French 4-cylinder 4-4-2 compound locomotives, 102 La France (1904) and 103 President and 104 Alliance (both 1905) for comparison purposes.

==Prototype==

In addition to acquiring the French compound locomotives Churchward built and tested his own prototype 4-cylinder locomotive simple-expansion locomotive, No. 40 North Star in 1906. As with some early members of the Saint class it was built as a 4-4-2 but designed so that it could easily be converted to a 4-6-0. It was completed at the Swindon Works of the GWR (Lot 161) in April 1906. It was numbered 40 and later that year was named &#x27;North Star&#x27;. In November 1909 it was converted to 4-6-0. The new design incorporated many ideas from the French locomotives, in particular, the four-cylinder layout, with the inside cylinders placed forward under the smokebox and the outside cylinders placed far back, in line with the rear wheels of the bogie; from this followed the divided drive with the outside cylinders connected to the second set of driving wheels whilst the inside cylinders were connected to the front set of driving wheels. The valve gear was an unusual design, called scissors gear, which eschewed the use of eccentrics, but was basically a variation on Walschaerts gear. The prototype locomotive was rebuilt as a member of the Castle Class in November 1929.

==Production series==
During initial trials the prototype proved to be largely successful although Charles Rous-Marten commented that &#x27;there were indications that with heavier loads, and less favourable weather, greater adhesion would be needed.&#x27; The production series were therefore all built with a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement. They also had inside Walschaerts valve gear rather than the scissors gear. Seven series of what would later be known as &#x27;Star Class&#x27; locomotives built between 1907 and 1923 each of which contained detailed differences from the others

===Star series===

The first series of ten locomotives were built at Swindon in 1907 (Lot 168) numbered 4001–4010 and named after well-known Stars, perpetuating the names of the earlier broad gauge GWR Star Class of 1838. All except for No. 4010 Western Star were built without superheaters. No. 4010 received a &#x27;Swindon No. 1&#x27; superheater and the remainder received superheated boilers between August 1909 and October 1912. No. 4009 Shooting Star was rebuilt as a member of the Castle Class in April 1925. The surviving members of the series were withdrawn 1932–1951, although No. 4003 &quot;Lode Star&quot; was preserved.

===Knight series===
A second series of ten similar locomotives appeared in 1908 (Swindon Lot 173), with improved bogies, numbered 4011–4020 and named after historical knights. Nos. 4011 was built with a Swindon No. 1 superheater, the remainder were fitted with the standard No.3 superheater between 1909 and 1911. They were withdrawn between 1932 and 1951.

===King series===

A third series of ten further locomotives appeared during 1909 (Swindon Lot 178), numbered 4021–4030 and named after British Kings. The framing for these had curved ends under the cab and over the cylinders. In June 1909, No. 4021 &quot;King Edward&quot; was built with a Swindon No. 3 superheater but the remainder had saturated steam boilers until 1910–13. &quot;King Edward&quot; notably hauled the funeral train for the funeral of King Edward VII on 20 May 1910; the mourners included nine kings and emperors, the largest number of crowned monarchs ever to travel in the same train. The class were all renamed during 1927 to allow for their names to be used on the new King Class. Instead, they were given names of a country followed by the word &#x27;Monarch&#x27; (e.g. &quot;The Norwegian Monarch&quot;). However, several of the names relating to enemy countries were removed during the Second World War (1940-1). They were all withdrawn between 1934 and 1952.

===Queen series===

A fourth series of ten further locomotives appeared during 1910 and 1911 (Swindon Lot 180). They were numbered 4031–4040 and named after British Queens. This series (and subsequent members of the class) were all built with a Swindon No. 3 superheater. This series was fitted with new style tenders. Two examples (No. 4032 &quot;Queen Alexandra&quot; and No. 4037 &quot;Queen Philippa&quot;) were rebuilt as Castle class locomotives in 1926. The remainder were withdrawn by British Railways between 1950 and 1952.

===Prince series===
Five further locomotives appeared in 1913 (Swindon Lot 195). These were numbered 4041–4045 and named after the sons of King George V. No. 4041 was built with enlarged diameter cylinders giving a tractive effort of . Once this was proved to be beneficial, this size gradually became the standard for the class, as they visited the works for their periodic overhaul. The boilers were given top-feed apparatus which also later became standard for the whole class. The locomotives were all withdrawn by British Railways between 1950 and 1953.

===Princess series===

The GWR experienced a substantial growth in long-distance passenger traffic immediately before the First World War requiring a further series of fifteen locomotives during the first six months of 1914 (Swindon Lot 199). These were numbered 4046–4060 and named after British princesses. They were all built with diameter cylinders and had improved boilers compared to the previous batch. They also introduced an improved four-cone vacuum ejector made necessary to improve braking on the increasingly long passenger trains. The locomotives were all withdrawn by British Railways between 1950 and 1957.

===Abbey series===

A final batch of twelve further locomotives appeared in 1922-1923 (Swindon Lot 217). These were numbered 4061–4072 and were named after famous Abbeys in the GWR territory. They were built with improved crank axles. In 1937 Nos. 4063–4072 were all rebuilt as Castle Class locomotives, being renumbered 5083–5092 but retaining their original names. The remaining two locomotives were withdrawn by British Railways in 1956 and 1957.

==Trials==
The class was criticised in letters to The Engineer for being expensive to build and maintain and Churchward was asked by his Directors to explain why &#x27;the London and North Western Railway could build three 4-6-0 locomotives for the cost of two of his.&#x27; His response was &#x27;Because one of mine could pull two of their bloody things backwards&#x27;. As a result, there were exchange trials proposed by Churchward with a LNWR Whale Experiment Class during August 1910 which vindicated the Star Class in terms of performance and coal consumption.

==Performance==
Members of the class performed well as passenger locomotives over all the long-distance routes of the GWR on the fastest express trains and those requiring the longest distance between stops. They gradually became displaced to secondary services by members of the Castle and King classes in the late 1920s and 1930s. Survivors continued to perform well until the mid-1950s. The 4000 class became a template for two later famous GWR 4-cylinder 4-6-0 classes - the Castle and King Class. According to le Fleming &quot;their performance was consistently of the highest standard and they were remarkable free-running engines which rarely suffered breakdown in service. ... No engines were more aptly named than the &#x27;Stars.&#x27;&quot;

==Modifications==
As already noted, between 1925 and 1940 Churchward&#x27;s successor Charles Collett ordered fifteen examples to be dismantled and their parts used in the construction of new Castle class locomotives.
Throughout their careers the remainder of the class was subject to detailed modifications and improvements to their boilers, smokeboxes, and steam pipes so that &quot;the only period when the appearance of the class was approximately uniform was from 1925 to 1927&quot;. tenders were also fitted from 1938 onwards.

==Preservation==
One example No. 4003 &quot;Lode Star&quot; has been preserved, after it was finally withdrawn in 1951, having covered 2,005,898 miles. The locomotive was preserved at Swindon railway works until 1962, then in the Museum of the Great Western Railway until transferred to the National Railway Museum in York in 1992, where it was a static non-working exhibit. In 2010 Lode Star was moved to Steam Museum in Swindon, as a static non-working exhibit. In November 2015, 4003 was moved back to the National Railway Museum.

In August 2022 the Great Western Society&#x27;s &quot;4709 group&quot; bought the GWR 4073 Class 7027 &quot;Thornbury Castle&quot;, with the intention of using the boiler to recreate a GWR 4700 Class. A few days after the purchase the &quot;4709 group&quot; stated that &quot;Thornbury Castle&#x27;s&quot; chassis and other components were to be used to recreate a GWR Star class locomotive, and eventually rebuilding it back into &quot;Thornbury Castle&quot;. However, in September 2022, those plans were cancelled.

==List of locomotives==
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 15 April 1923, locomotive No. 4048 &quot;Princess Victoria&quot; was hauling a freight train that was in a head-on collision with a passenger train, hauled by GWR 517 Class 0-4-2T No. 215, at Curry Rivel, Somerset due to a signalman&#x27;s error. Nine people were injured.

<text>The 4073 or Castle Class are 4-6-0 steam locomotives of the Great Western Railway, built between 1923 and 1950. They were designed by the railway&#x27;s Chief Mechanical Engineer, Charles Collett, for working the company&#x27;s express passenger trains. They could reach speeds of up to .

==Background==
The origins of this highly successful design date back to the Star Class of 1907 which introduced the basic 4-cylinder 4-6-0 layout with long-travel valves and Belpaire firebox that was to become characteristic of Great Western Railway (GWR) express passenger locomotives. The Star class was designed to take the top express trains on the GWR, with 61 in service by 1914, but after World War I there was a need for an improved design. To meet this need, Chief Mechanical Engineer George Churchward had in mind an enlarged Star class design with a standard No.7 boiler, as fitted to his GWR 4700 Class express freight 2-8-0. However, this combination would have taken the axle load over the 20-ton limit then set by the civil engineers, and in the end, nothing came of the idea.

==Design==
Charles Collett succeeded Churchward as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the GWR in 1922 and immediately set about meeting the need for a new locomotive design that would both supplement the Stars and replace them on the heaviest expresses. Collett&#x27;s solution was to take the basic layout of the Star with an extended frame, and add a newly designed No.8 boiler which was both larger and lighter. The increased amount of steam that this produced allowing an increase in the cylinder diameter from to . The extended frame allowed for a side window cab and an increased grate area. The result was an increase in tractive effort to 31,625 lb, and a locomotive that looked attractive and well proportioned while remaining within the 20-ton axle limit.

==Production==
Unlike the Star class, there was no prototype. Collett was sufficiently confident of the design to place an order with Swindon Works (Lot 224) for ten locomotives in 1923, although there was a four-month delay between the appearance of the first example in August 1923 and the second in December, to allow for the correction of any teething problems. Thereafter the remaining eight locomotives came out at regular intervals until April 1924. They were 4073–4082, the number series continuing unbroken from the Star class. The last 12 Star class locomotives, which were built in 1922–23, had been given names of abbeys in the western area served by the GWR. The new locomotives were named after castles, also in the west, beginning with &quot;Caerphilly Castle&quot;.

Over the twenty-seven years from August 1923 to August 1950, 155 Castles were built new at Swindon Works and a further sixteen were converted from other classes. In February 1952, two engines, 4082 &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; and 7013 &quot;Bristol Castle&quot;, swapped names and numbers: 7013 was disguised as 4082 to run George VI&#x27;s funeral train and the numbers were never swapped back. 4082 was withdrawn from service in 1964 as 7013 and 7013 was withdrawn from service as 4082 in 1965.

These locomotives were built with minimal changes to the dimensions. However, from 5013 &quot;Abergavenny Castle&quot; there was an alteration to the shape of the front-end casing over the inside cylinders, and from 5043 &quot;Earl of Mount Edgcumbe&quot; a shorter chimney was fitted. Those built before 1926 were fitted with a tender but thereafter became standard for the class.

===Rebuilds===
Between January and September 1924, the only Great Western 4-6-2, No.111 The Great Bear, was rebuilt into a member of the Castle Class, although only the &quot;front portion of the original frames and the number plates were used again but probably little else&quot;. The new locomotive was renamed &quot;Viscount Churchill&quot; and survived until withdrawal in July 1953.

In April 1925, Star class No. 4009 &quot;Shooting Star&quot; was likewise rebuilt as a Castle by extending the frames and fitting a new Castle Class boiler and cab. It was renumbered and renamed 100 A1 &quot;Lloyds&quot; and was withdrawn in 1950.

In October 1925 a second Star class, No. 4016 &quot;The Somerset Light Infantry (Prince Albert&#x27;s)&quot;, was similarly converted to a Castle although in this case, it retained its name and number. Two further conversions of Stars were undertaken in 1926; Nos. 4032 &quot;Queen Alexandra&quot; and 4037 &quot;The South Wales Borderers&quot; retaining their names and numbers and surviving until 1951 and 1962 respectively.

In November 1929 the prototype for the Star Class, No. 4000 &quot;North Star&quot; was rebuilt into a Castle, being subsequently withdrawn in 1957.

Between 1937 and 1940 a further ten members of the &#x27;Abbey series&#x27; of the Star class (Nos. 4063–4072) were rebuilt as Castles on Lot 317. They were allocated new numbers 5083 to 5092 but retained their original names and were withdrawn between 1958 and 1964.

==Publicity and trials==

When introduced they were heralded as Britain&#x27;s most powerful express passenger locomotive, being some 10% more powerful than the Stars. The first, No. 4073 &quot;Caerphilly Castle&quot;, made its debut at Paddington station on 23 August 1923. The choice of 4082 as &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; proved fortuitous as this locomotive was used to haul the Royal Train when King George V and Queen Mary visited Swindon Works in 1924, and much publicity was gained when the king was invited to drive the engine back from the works to the station before the return journey, with the Queen and several high-ranking GWR officers also on the footplate.

During 1924, 4073 &quot;Caerphilly Castle&quot; was exhibited at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley, alongside Nigel Gresley&#x27;s &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;. The Great Western declared their engine to be more powerful than its bigger LNER rival, and in terms of tractive effort alone they were entitled to do so. As a result of this, GWR General Manager Sir Felix Pole proposed to LNER Southern Area General Manager Alexander Wilson that a trial of the two types should take place via an exchange arrangement. The resulting trials commenced in April 1925 with 4079 &quot;Pendennis Castle&quot; representing the GWR on the East Coast Main Line and 4474 &quot;Victor Wild&quot; representing the LNER on GWR tracks. On the first morning &quot;Pendennis Castle&quot; was to work a 480-ton train from King&#x27;s Cross to Doncaster, and LNER officials fully expected the smaller, lighter engine to encounter problems climbing Holloway Bank. However, railway writer Cecil J. Allen records that the GWR locomotive made a faster start from King&#x27;s Cross to Finsbury Park than any LNER Pacific he had recorded up to that time, and over the trial &quot;Pendennis Castle&quot; kept well within the scheduled time and used less coal, considerably denting LNER pride. For the LNER, &quot;Victor Wild&quot; was compared on the &quot;Cornish Riviera Express&quot; to 4074 &quot;Caldicot Castle&quot; and although it kept to time the longer wheelbase of the Pacific proved unsuited to the many curves on the route. Again the GWR took the honours with &quot;Caldicot Castle&quot; burning less fuel and always ahead of time, this being illustrated on the last 2 days of the trial by gaining 15 minutes on the schedule in both directions.

In 1926, number 5000 &quot;Launceston Castle&quot; was loaned to the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway (LMS) where it ran trials between London and Carlisle. The locomotive fulfilled the LMS requirements so well that the latter first requested the GWR to build a batch of Castles for use on the West Coast Main Line, and, failing that, a full set of construction drawings. Both proposals were rejected by the GWR Board of Directors. The LMS eventually succeeded in gaining access to the design by recruiting William Stanier, the GWR&#x27;s Works Manager at its Swindon Works to become the new Chief Mechanical Engineer for the LMS.

In 1935 attention was turning to streamlining locomotives, particularly with the introduction of the LNER A4, and the GWR felt that they could gain publicity in this area. Instructions were passed to Swindon Works to select a suitable locomotive and as 5005 &quot;Manorbier Castle&quot; was being prepared for test, additions were made to the locomotive to effect some streamlining. The application of shaped steel sheet in an attempt to smooth airflow has been described as a &quot;bodge-up&quot; and certainly lacked either the elegance of the A4 design, or the sense of power associated with the streamlined LMS Coronation Class introduced 2 years later. Once the additions had been added a test run was carried out between Bristol and Swindon during which &quot;Manorbier Castle&quot; achieved a speed of 100 mph, but the experiment did not have any lasting effect on GWR locomotive design and the additions were later removed.

==Performance==
The Castles handled all but the heaviest loads, these being entrusted to the 30-strong King Class, themselves a development of the Castles with an even larger boiler and smaller wheels (6 ft 6 in diameter) for both increased tractive effort and to allow for loading gauge clearance.

The Castle class was noted for superb performance overall, and notably on the &quot;Cheltenham Flyer&quot; during the 1930s: for example, on 6 June 1932 the train, pulled by 5006 &quot;Tregenna Castle&quot;, covered the 77.25 miles from Swindon to Paddington at an average speed of 81.68 mph start-to-stop (124.3 km at an average speed of 131.4 km/h). This world record for steam traction was widely regarded as an astonishing feat.

==Subsequent modification== 

In 1946 Frederick Hawksworth, Collett&#x27;s successor, introduced a higher degree of superheat to the Castle boiler with resulting increased economy in water consumption. From 1956 the fitting of double chimneys to selected engines, combined with larger superheaters, further enhanced their capacity for sustained high-speed performance. The fastest recorded speed of a Castle Class engine was 102 mph achieved by 7018 &quot;Drysllwyn Castle&quot; at Little Somerford in April 1958 while hauling &quot;The Bristolian&quot; from Bristol to London. The non-stop run over 117.6 miles took 93 minutes 50 seconds, an average speed of more than 75 mph.

=== Oil firing ===

Between 1946 and 1948 five engines—100A1, 5039, 5079, 5083 and 5091—were converted to oil-firing, but were soon restored to burn coal. Eleven Halls were also temporarily converted.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 2 July 1941, 4091 &quot;Dudley Castle&quot; was hauling an express passenger train that was in a head-on collision with a freight train, hauled by LMS Stanier 8F 2-8-0 No. WD 407 (LMS 8293), at , Berkshire. 5 people were killed and 21 were injured.
*On 30 November 1948, a passenger train hauled by 5022 &quot;Wigmore Castle&quot; overran signals and was in collision with locomotive 4150, which was running round its train at . Eight passengers were injured.
*On 12 November 1958, a freight train, hauled by GWR 4700 Class 2-8-0 No. 4707, overran signals and was derailed at Highworth Junction, Swindon. Locomotive No. 5009 &quot;Shrewsbury Castle&quot; was hauling a newspaper train which collided with the wreckage.

==Royal connections==
On 28 April 1924, King George V drove locomotive No. 4082 &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; from the Swindon Works to Swindon railway station, accompanied on the footplate by Queen Mary. Plaques to commemorate the event were fixed to the sides of the cab and it was considered to be a royal locomotive from then onwards. At the king&#x27;s state funeral on 28 January 1936, &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; was chosen to haul the funeral train from Paddington Station in London to Windsor &amp; Eton. It was preceded at ten-minute intervals by another six trains hauled by Castle-class engines, each carrying royal and other important mourners.

The same locomotive was requested for the funeral of King George VI in February 1952; however, &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; was under repair at Swindon, so the number, name plate and commemorative plaques were swapped with No. 7013 &quot;Bristol Castle&quot; for the event. Following the funeral, the two locomotives retained their exchanged names and numbers, but the commemorative plaques were returned. No. 7013 (originally 4082) was scrapped in September 1964 while number 4082 (originally 7013) survived until February 1965.

==Withdrawal==
Withdrawal of steam power started in the 1950s, with the first 100 A1 &quot;Lloyds&quot; withdrawn from Old Oak Common in March 1950. The first &quot;new build&quot; Castle, number 4091 &quot;Dudley Castle&quot;, was withdrawn from Old Oak Common nearly nine years later in January 1959.

The lowest mileage of a Castle was the 580,346 miles run by 7035 &quot;Ogmore Castle&quot; between August 1950 and June 1964; the highest mileage of any Castle class was by 4080 &quot;Powderham Castle&quot; which totalled 1,974,461 miles in 40 years and 5 months.

The last three Castles to be withdrawn were all allocated to Gloucester shed, with 5042 &quot;Winchester Castle&quot; and 7022 &quot;Hereford Castle&quot; withdrawn in June 1965. The last to be withdrawn was 7029 &quot;Clun Castle&quot; in December 1965, which worked the last steam train out of Paddington on 27 November 1965.

==Preservation==
On 4 March 1967, Nos. 7029 &quot;Clun Castle&quot; and 4079 &quot;Pendennis Castle&quot; hauled specials from Banbury and Oxford respectively to Chester, to mark the end of through trains between Paddington and Birkenhead. These two, and six other Castles, survive in preservation.

Of the eight Castles to be preserved, six have steamed in preservation and have been operated on the main line. Three were obtained direct from BR, 4073, 4079 and 7029, with the remaining five being rescued from Barry Scrapyard.

No. 4073 &quot;Caerphilly Castle&quot; was given directly to the National Collection upon withdrawal and has not run since being preserved. It can currently be found at STEAM, the Museum of the Great Western Railway in Swindon. No. 7027 &quot;Thornbury Castle&quot; was in ex-Barry Scrapyard condition and in July 2016 was sold by Pete Waterman to the Somerset transport firm JJP Holdings SW, transported to Weston-super-Mare on a low loader, then placed on a temporary track in the Crosville Motor Services bus depot. In summer 2018 it was moved briefly to Tyseley Locomotive Works in Birmingham to make an appearance at their open weekend before moving to its planned home at the West Somerset Railway for restoration. It is now located at Loughborough on the Great Central Railway, but will not be restored to mainline standards as its current owner intends to run it for its first ticket on the GCR before considering future mainline certification.

Two of the eight preserved Castles, nos. 5043 &quot;Earl of Mount Edgcumbe&quot; and 7029 &quot;Clun Castle&quot;, are fitted with double chimneys while the remaining six are still fitted with the original single chimney.

4079 was purchased by Sir William McAlpine and hauled a small number of railtours on the main line in its early preservation years before being sold to Hamersley Iron in the Pilbara region of Western Australia and exported in 1977. In 1989 it was moved by road to Perth where it double-headed with 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; operating as far as Esperance. In 2000 it was donated by Rio Tinto to the Great Western Society and restored to operational condition at the Didcot Railway Centre in 2021.
, three Castles are operational. Both 5043 and 7029 have mainline certificates with 4079 restricted to only operate on heritage lines. Two engines, 5029 and 5080, are in the process of undergoing overhauls. 5080 is due to have its boiler assessed in 2024 to ascertain the cost of its overhaul; to speed up the engine&#x27;s return to service only the boiler is to be overhauled while its bottom-end remains intact. The engine will only operate on heritage railways at first, but a full mechanical overhaul to mainline standards will be undertaken once enough money has been raised. The engine will eventually become part of Tyseley&#x27;s pool of mainline certified alongside class members 5043 and 7029. In 2023, 5029 was undergoing a mainline standard overhaul to be completed by late 2024.

4079 was originally planned to operate on the mainline following completion of its overhaul, but Didcot later announced that they intended to stop operating on the mainline, running only on heritage railways. Upon completion of its restoration, 7027 is also intended to operate only on heritage railways, however debate over its restoration continued.

<text>Bataan (, , ), officially the Province of Bataan (, ), is a province in the Central Luzon region of the Philippines. Its capital is the city of Balanga while Mariveles is the largest town in the province. Occupying the entire Bataan Peninsula on Luzon, Bataan is bordered by the provinces of Zambales and Pampanga to the north. The peninsula faces the South China Sea to the west and Subic Bay to the north-west, and encloses Manila Bay to the east.

The Battle of Bataan is known in history as one of the last stands of American and Filipino soldiers before they were overwhelmed by the Japanese forces in World War II. The Bataan Death March was named after the province, where the infamous march started.

==History==
===Aeta peoples===
The first inhabitants of the Bataan peninsula are the Ayta Magbeken people. The next group of inhabitants were Kapampangans, who settled on eastern Bataan.

===Tagalog migration===
Later on, Tagalogs from southern Luzon, most specifically Cavite, migrated to parts of Bataan. The Ayta Magbeken migrated towards the mountain areas of Bataan by the end of the 16th century.

===Spanish rule===
In 1647, Dutch naval forces landed in the country in an attempt to seize the islands from Spain. The Dutch massacred the people of Abucay in Bataan.

Historian Cornelio Bascara documents that the province of Bataan was established on 11 January 1757, by Governor-General Pedro Manuel Arandia out of territories belonging to Pampanga and the &quot;corregimiento&quot; of Mariveles which, at that time, included Maragondon across Manila Bay. Tagalogs migrated to east Bataan, where Kapampangans assimilated to the Tagalogs. Kapampangans were displaced to the towns near Pampanga by that time, along with the Aetas. By the end of the 1700s, Bataan had 3,082 native families and 619 Spanish Filipino families.

===Japanese invasion===


Bataan featured prominently during World War II. Prior to the 1941 Japanese invasion, Bataan was a military reservation for the purpose of defending the fortress island of Corregidor. The US Army stored nearly of gasoline there, along with various munitions. At the southern tip of the peninsula the U.S. Navy had established a small base at the port of Mariveles.

Shortly after the Japanese Army invaded the country in December 1941, the combined US and Filipino forces were being gradually overrun and General Douglas MacArthur moved his troops to the Bataan Peninsula in an attempt to hold out until a relief force could be sent from the US. Japanese forces started a siege of the peninsula on 7 January 1942, and launched an all-out assault on 3 April, a few months after the Battle of the Points, Battle of the Pockets, the attack down Trail Number Two, and a half-dozen other brutal battles. The Bataan campaign was the last time a regular cavalry unit of the U.S. Army, the Philippine Scouts 26th Cavalry, was used as a horse mounted fighting unit. On the morning of 16 January 1942, Lt. Edwin Ramsey led the last cavalry charge into the town of Morong, routing the advancing Japanese infantry. As the troops on Bataan were continually reduced in rations, the horses were eventually slaughtered to feed the starving soldiers.

The majority of the American and Filipino forces surrendered on 9 April and were forced to march more than from Bataan to Capas, Tarlac, which became known as the Bataan Death March.

===Postwar era===
Postwar reconstruction in the province of Bataan was generally slow, although there were efforts to pursue industrialization projects in the area, most notably the establishment of the NASSCO (National Shipyard and Steel Corporation) in Mariveles which was inaugurated in 1953 during the Quirino administration. It would later be bought by the Bataan Shipping and Engineering Company in 1964.

===Marcos dictatorship===

The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Bataan. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. 

Just as this was happening, it was revealed that the site of two communities where the workers of NASSCO lived - Barrio NASSCO and Barrio Camaya - would be torn down for converstion into the new Bataan Export Processing Zone in 1969, compelling the relocation of the residents who in turn launched protests until the BEPZ was finally built in 1972.

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. 

By this time, the social unrest of the pre-martial law period and the Marcos&#x27; violent responses to the protests of the time led many of the Philippines&#x27; youth, who previously held moderate positions calling for political reform, to be radicalized. Some were convinced to joined the newly-formed New People&#x27;s Army as a last desperate way to resist Marcos&#x27; authoritarianism, including Catalino Blas, Amado Bugay, and Delia Cortez, who were all idealistic activists killed in encounters with Marcos&#x27; forces in various locations in Bataan. But many noncombatants were killed as well, such as Social Worker and Catholic lay worker Puri Pedro, who had been wounded as part of the collateral damage during one encounter in 1977, but was assassinated in cold blood by a soldier who identified himself as Col. Rolando Abadilla while she was recovering at the Bataan Provincial Hospital.

It was also during Martial Law that construction on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant began in Morong, in 1976. Marcos had announced an intention to build a nuclear power plant in July 1973, not long after the declaration of Martial Law, and a presidential committee was set up to review proposals, of which there were two - one each from General Electric and Westinghouse Electric. The committee preferred the proposal of General Electric&#x27;s bid although it cost more, because it contained detailed specifications for the plant. But Marcos, in a deal brokered by crony Herminio Disini, overrode then and signed a letter of intent awarding the project to Westinghouse, despite the absence of any specifications on their proposal. The project was plagued with problems throughout construction, including location, welding, cabling, pipes and valves, permits, and kickbacks, as well as setbacks such as the decline of Marcos&#x27;s influence due to bad health and PR fallout from the incident at the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor. A subsequent safety inquiry into the plant revealed over 4,000 defects. Another issues raisead regarding it was the proximity of a major geological fault line and of the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo. By March 1975, Westinghouse&#x27;s cost estimate ballooned to US$1.2 billion without much explanation. The final cost was $2.2 Billion for a single reactor producing half the power of the original proposal. Many problems identified in earlier stages remained throughout construction, as reported by inspectors though denied by Westinghouse. The power plant was responsible for generating 10% of the country&#x27;s external debt, despite never actually operating.

===Contemporary era===
On 14 March 2020, Bataan recorded one of the earliest cases of COVID-19 infection outside of Metro Manila, with a male patient from Orani being the 64th recorded case in the Philippines. Bataan later became one of the provinces under the Enhanced community quarantine in Luzon.

There are more than 100 rivers in the province radiating from the two aforementioned mountain groups. These are important not only for irrigation but also for navigation and fishing as well. The Talisay and Almacen Rivers are the two major rivers in the province. Talisay has its headwater in the Mariveles mountain group extending down to Pilar and Balanga into Manila Bay. Almacen River has its headwater in the Natib mountains extending down to Hermosa and exits through the Orani Channel to Manila Bay. Some of the smaller rivers are Abo-abo River, Bantalan River, Lamao River, Saysayin River, Agloloma River, Mamala River.

===Power===
====Generation====

Bataan is a location of bulk power generation, where most of the power generated is sent to the Luzon Grid. Most power plants in Bataan rely on fossil fuels, like oil and coal, but renewable energy sources, primarily solar power, form part of the total generation. As of 30 November 2022 the total installed capacity of existing power plants equals to 3,676.7 MW. Incoming power plants that are under construction will increase the output to 4,920.7 MW, with targeted commissioning date of 3rd quarter, 2023 to 3rd quarter, 2026.

Fossil fuel-fired plants account for 3,528 MW, and are mostly concentrated in Limay and Mariveles. These include the GN Power Mariveles Coal Power Plant, with 690 (2x345) MW, SMC Limay Greenfield Power Plant (4x150 MW), Petron Cogeneration Power Plant (4x35 MW), Panasia Bataan Combined Cycle Power Plant (648 MW), and the recently commissioned GN Power Dinginin Units 1 and 2 (725x2 MW). Two plants are under construction, Petron&#x27;s Refinery Solid Fuel-Fired Boiler Project - Phase 3 (44 MW), and SMC Mariveles Coal Power Plant (8x150 MW). These will increase the capacity by additional 1,244 MW. Three natural gas-fired power plants with combined capacity of 3,275 MW are proposed, one planned in Limay and two in Mariveles. These are currently endorsed by the Department of Energy for grid-impact study.

Renewable energy, accounts for 92.4 MW. Existing renewable energy power plants include the Bataan 2020 Cogen Power Plant (12.5 MW), Cleangreen Energy Corp. Napier Grass Fired Power Plant (12 MW), YH Green Energy Solar Power Plant (12.6 MW), Citicore Solar Power Plant (18 MW), Morong Solar Power Plant (5 MW), and Jobin-Sqm Inc.&#x27;s (a subsidiary of Nickel Asia Corporation) Sta. Rita Solar (32.3 MW) in Tipo, Hermosa side of Subic Bay Freeport Zone. While additional 11.64 MW are expected from two projects that are on the advanced stage of construction, these are Citicore&#x27;s 6.64 MW solar rooftop project in the Freeport Area of Bataan, and Ayala Corp.&#x27;s Bataan Solar Energy Inc. with 5 MW in Batangas Dos, Mariveles. Two more solar power projects are in the pipeline - Solana Solar Power Project (28 MW) and Jobin-Sqm Inc. Bataan Solar Power Project Phases 1, 2, 3a-3b (100 MW).

<text>Kinnekulle is a flat-topped mountain in the county of Västergötland, southwestern Sweden, on the eastern shore of lake Vänern. Its highest point is above sea level. The mountain is long and wide at the top.

== Geology ==

Despite its enormous size, Kinnekulle is actually the smaller remnant of a much larger plateau, long ago worn down to a flat plain. Some 550 million years ago, in the Neoproterozoic Era, the bottom-most rock of the plateau was under the sea. Layers of sedimentary rock formed over that layer from sand, mud, and sea animal remains.

About 200 million years ago, during the Mesozoic era, the area was uplifted above the sea. Tectonic activity forced molten lava through the sedimentary rock, creating sheetlike layers of diabase. These layers, when present, protected the softer sedimentary rock beneath them from erosion, resulting in mesa-like mountains such as Kinnekulle and its neighbours.

== History ==
The historic town and church of Husaby are located on the south side of the Kinnekulle. Tradition says that Olof Skötkonung, the first Christian King of Sweden, was baptized here in 1008 at a well located just north of the church.

The mountain of Kinnefjellet at Spitsbergen, Svalbard, is named after Kinnekulle.

<text>Ernest Bristow Farrar (7 July 1885 – 18 September 1918) was an English composer, pianist and organist.

==Life==
Ernest Farrar was born in Lewisham, London, but moved in 1887 to Micklefield in Yorkshire, where his father was a clergyman. The rest of his life was very much centred in the north of England. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School, where he began organ studies. His studies at Durham University did not progress beyond his matriculation.

In May 1905 he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. There he studied with Sir Charles Villiers Stanford and Sir Walter Parratt and began friendships with Frank Bridge and Geoffrey Molyneux Palmer. He also took up several posts as organist in All Saints&#x27; Dresden, St Hilda&#x27;s, South Shields and Christ Church, High Harrogate. At Harrogate, he worked closely with local conductor Julian Clifford and took on the 14-year-old Gerald Finzi as a composition pupil. In 1913, he married Olive Mason in South Shields. His best man at the wedding was Ernest Bullock.

His career was cut short by the outbreak of World War I, as he enlisted in the Grenadier Guards in 1915 and joined the regiment in August 1916. He was commissioned as Second Lieutenant, 3rd Battalion Devonshire Regiment on 27 February 1918.

Farrar was killed on the Western Front at the Battle of Epehy Ronssoy, near Le Cateau in the Somme Valley south, west of Cambrai, on 18 September 1918. He had been at the front for two days.

His grave lies just outside the churchyard wall in Ronssoy Communal Cemetery Extension, in a corner under a few trees. A Requiem Mass was said at Micklefield, on 29 September, the Feast of St. Michael and All Angels. A concert was dedicated to his memory at Harrogate by Julian Clifford on 17 September 1919, including the tone-poem &quot;Lights Out&quot;, written expressly for Farrar, and Farrar&#x27;s &quot;Variations in G On An Old British Sea-Song&quot; for piano and orchestra. His name is one of the 38 on the War Memorial at the Royal College of Music.

==Works and legacy==
Despite his short life, Farrar wrote a large body of music for orchestra, voices and organ. His works include &quot;The Blessed Damozel&quot;, a &quot;Celtic Suite&quot; and the song cycle &quot;Vagabond Songs&quot;. Two orchestral pieces, the suite &quot;English Pastoral Impressions&quot; and the &quot;Three Spiritual Studies&quot; (for string orchestra) were published posthumously under the Carnegie Collection of British Music imprint. However, apart from a few songs his works are now rarely performed. Stephen Banfield has identified several characteristic traits in Farrar&#x27;s music, representative of the English pre-war era: the use of folksong (&quot;English Pastoral Impressions&quot;); &quot;muscular&quot; settings of Walt Whitman (in the choral suite &quot;Out of Doors&quot;, Op. 14); and intimate lyricism (in &quot;Margaritae sorori&quot;, a choral setting of words by W. E. Henley from 1916).

Some of his orchestral music has been recorded by the Philharmonia Orchestra on the Chandos label, and some of his songs and organ works have been recorded too.

Today, Farrar is perhaps best known as the teacher of Gerald Finzi, who was deeply affected by Farrar&#x27;s death. Frank Bridge was also deeply affected, and dedicated his Piano Sonata to the memory of Farrar.

<text>Husaby is a village, near Kinnekulle, belonging to Götene Municipality in the province of Västergötland, Sweden. 
==Husaby Church==
Husaby is most known for Husaby Church (&quot;Husaby kyrka&quot;) a medieval stone church. During the early 11th century, it was a wooden church. A little later, the original church was replaced by the current stone church. The tower was built in the late 11th century and in the early 12th century the stone church. Olof Skötkonung (c. 980–1022), the first Christian king of Sweden, is rumoured to have allowed himself to be baptised at a well by the church in 1008 possibly by English missionary Saint Sigfrid of Sweden.

Architecturally, Husaby Church is remarkable for its steep walls and high towers, arguably the only Romanesque architecture in Sweden of that kind. The church belonged to a network of royal estates called Uppsala öd.
The altarpiece was performed by Flemish sculptor George Baselaque and donated to the church in 1679 by Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie (1622-1686). One of the oldest objects in the church is the baptismal font in sandstone from the early 13th century. 

In 1901, when the church was restored, the lime layer was knocked away from the arches and walls. C W Pettersson, who worked with architect Axel Herman Hägg (1835-1921), made a proposal for the reconstruction of the original decor in the choir from the 15th century, which was approved by the National Heritage Board.

<text>Frankland Wilmot Davey, FRSC (born April 19, 1940) is a Canadian poet and scholar.

Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, he grew up in the Fraser Valley village of Abbotsford. In 1957 he enrolled at the University of British Columbia where, in 1961, shortly after beginning MA studies, he became one of the founding editors of the influential and contentious poetry newsletter &quot;TISH&quot;. In the spring of 1962 he won the university&#x27;s Macmillan Prize for poetry, and published the poetry collection &quot;D-Day and After&quot;, the first of the Tish group&#x27;s numerous publications. In 1963 he began teaching at Canadian Services College Royal Roads Military College in Victoria. He began doctoral studies at the University of Southern California in the summer of 1965, completing in 1968. After serving as writer-in-residence at Montreal&#x27;s Sir George Williams University, he joined the English Department of York University in Toronto in 1970, becoming department chair in 1986. He was appointed in 1990 to the Carl F. Klinck Chair of Canadian Literature at the University of Western Ontario in London. From 1975 to 1992 he was one of the most active editors of the Coach House Press. He currently lives in Strathroy, Ontario.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Frank Davey was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, but raised in the nearby Fraser Valley village of Abbotsford (1941 population 562), close to the Canada-US border. He was the son Wilmot Elmer Davey, a hydro company laborer and truck driver, and Doris Brown, who had emigrated with her family from Britain at age 4. Much of his childhood in Abbotsford is pseudonymously recounted in his 2005 poetry volume &quot;Back to the War&quot; and in the first person in his 2011 memoir &quot;When TISH Happens&quot;. Together the two books also provide the only mid-century literary portrait of the surprisingly diverse Abbotsford community and the surrounding Fraser Valley farmland. Davey enrolled at the University of British Columbia in 1957 where he met the influential poetry theorist Warren Tallman and student writers George Bowering, Daphne Marlatt, Lionel Kearns, Carol Bolt, Jamie Reid, and Fred Wah, and in 1960 the charismatic San Francisco poet Robert Duncan. With Bowering, Reid, and Wah, and the advice of Tallman and Duncan, he founded the poetry newsletter &quot;TISH&quot; in 1961.

===Academic and Writing career===
The success of &quot;TISH&quot;, which the editors mailed free of charge for nineteen successive months to poets, editors, and critics across Canada and much of the US, brought Davey to the attention of the senior Canadian writers George Woodcock and Louis Dudek. Woodcock, editor of the journal &quot;Canadian Literature&quot;, commissioned in 1962 the first of several essays from him, and Dudek invited him to guest-edit a Vancouver issue of his important poetry magazine &quot;Delta&quot;. Woodcock&#x27;s intervention may have been the more significant, encouraging the young poet to take up literary criticism as well, and from the 1970s to the 90s write a body of work that would be called &#x27;the most individual and influential ever written in Canada.&#x27;

Davey published his first poetry collection, &quot;D-Day and After&quot;, in 1962, with an introduction by Tallman that emphasized how this was poetry as the act of the moment rather than poetry as the commonplace attempt &#x27;to express ... feelings.&#x27; It was the first of more than a hundred volumes to be published by the &quot;TISH&quot; editors. Receiving an MA from UBC in 1963, Davey taught for the Canadian armed forces at Royal Roads Military College in Victoria, BC until 1969, while also working on a doctorate in poetics at the University of Southern California in the summers of 1965 and 1966, and a 1966–67 leave of absence. He witnessed the 1965 Watts riots from an apartment within the curfew zone, feeling more endangered, he indicates in &#x27;Writing a Life&#x27; (99–100) and &quot;When TISH Happens&quot; (224), by the US National Guard than by the mostly black protesters. It seems very possible that this experience contributed to his later insistence in his political and cultural writings that the Canadian nation-state should be a collaboration open to the meaningful participation of all its citizens. In the fall of 1965 his third and fourth volumes of poetry were published. He also launched his poetry and criticism journal &quot;Open Letter&quot; that fall of 1965, designing it initially as an open editorial dialogue with former &quot;Tish&quot; editors Bowering and David Dawson. In the spring of 1968 he received his PhD, having presented a thesis on the poetics of the Black Mountain poets.

In the spring of 1969 he was appointed Writer-in-Residence for 1969–70 at Sir George Williams (now Concordia) University in Montreal. The following year he joined the faculty of York University in Toronto to teach Canadian Literature and, amid teaching and research collaborations with Clara Thomas and Barbara Godard, quickly assumed a nationally influential role. He published two poetry collections in each of 1970, 1971, and 1972, and a selected poems in 1972. He published a monograph on Earle Birney in 1971, and the widely praised &quot;From There to Here: A Guide to English-Canadian Literature Since 1960&quot;, the first book to theorize Canadian postmodernism, in 1974. But his most important contribution in these years was his withering critique, &#x27;Surviving the Paraphrase,&#x27; of the thematic criticism of Northrop Frye, D. G. Jones and Margaret Atwood which he delivered at the founding conference of the Association for Canadian and Quebec Literatures in the spring of 1974. That paper, in Stephen Scobie&#x27;s words &#x27;a vastly influential essay&#x27;, almost immediately discredited thematic criticism in Canada and, forty years later, reverberates as well within Canadian postcolonial studies.

In 1976 he was appointed Coordinator of the York University creative writing program, and also joined, along with bpNichol and Michael Ondaatje, the new editorial board of The Coach House Press. With the assistance of Nichol and Barbara Godard, he was also expanding the pages and range of &quot;Open Letter&quot; to give attention to Québécois poets, women writers, and poststructuralist poetics, developing it into what Gregory Betts in &quot;The Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; would call &#x27;Canada&#x27;s most important forum for discussion and examination of innovative and experimental ideas and texts.&#x27; In 1982 he helped conduct a month-long workshop in Dharwar, India, for young academics many of whom became major contributors to Canadian Studies in that country. Here he wrote one of his most important long poems, the &quot;brilliant poetic commentary on postcolonialism&quot; &quot;The Abbotsford Guide to India&quot;, published in 1986—one of six poetry books he published in the 1980s. That year he was also elected chair of the York University Department of English. Two years earlier he had published the first study of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s feminism: &quot;Margaret Atwood: A Feminist Poetics.&quot; As Chair of English he supported Joseph Pivato, the Elia Chair at York for 1987-88, to teach the first course on Italian-Canadian literature.

In 1990 he was named the first Carl F. Klinck Professor of Canadian Literature at the University of Western Ontario (now Western University), in London, Ontario, and began a new writing phase in which he adapted discourse analysis to Canadian cultural studies, and examined various Canadian cultural scenes—from those of literary criticism to those of politics, celebrity, and popular crime writing. His new books included &quot;Post-National Arguments: The Politics of the Anglo-Canadian Novel since 1967&quot; (1993), &quot;Reading &#x27;KIM&#x27; Right&quot; (1993), an analysis of the public persona of Kim Campbell, Canada&#x27;s first woman prime minister, &quot;Canadian Literary Power&quot; (1994), a study of how Canadian literary reputations are constructed and defended, &quot;Karla&#x27;s Web: A Cultural Examination of the Mahaffy-French Murders&quot; (1994), an examination of how newspaper crime writing distorts both victims and criminal justice issues, &quot;Cultural Mischief: A Practical Guide to Multiculturalism&quot; (1996), a poetry collection that mocked both the sentimentalities of multiculturalism&#x27;s proponents and the narcissism of its critics, and &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs G-G&quot; (2002) an examination of Canadian Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson and her husband, writer John Ralston Saul, that accused both of a pretentiousness that misrepresented and stifled actual Canadian realities. As Betts observes with some understatement, this was &#x27;a critical stance that has occasionally put him into conflict with the Canadian literary establishment.&#x27; Its consequences are likely reflected in Davey&#x27;s description in &quot;When TISH Happens&quot; of Canadian literary and academic prizes as institutional rewards for &#x27;banality and careerism&#x27; (304). Meanwhile, in May 1994 he had been elected president of the Association of Canadian College and University Teachers of English (ACCUTE). That November he had led the Association in issuing a controversial and widely publicized &#x27;caution&#x27; against the postsecondary education policies of the British Columbia government and the resulting working conditions and quality of education at its recently established University Colleges.

Davey continued his creativity at the expense of currently established critical pieties in the poetry collections &quot;Dog&quot; (2002) and &quot;Risky Propositions&quot; (2005), both partly directed at identity politics, the &#x27;flarf&#x27; books &quot;Lack On!&quot; (2009), a mock-Lacanian tribute to Fred Wah, and &quot;Bardy Google&quot; (2010), part of which was a Dunciad-like send-up of recent Canadian criticism, and the limited edition visual poetry book, &quot;Canonical Canadian Literature&quot; (2011). Meanwhile, the final years of provincial mandatory retirement legislation ended his Western Ontario teaching years in 2005. He was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 2014.

===Family life===
Davey married education student Helen Simmons, also from Abbotsford, in 1962, during the final year of his MA studies. She later taught school in Victoria and accompanied him to the University of Southern California where she earned a master&#x27;s degree in special education. They divorced in 1969. Shortly after, he married Linda Jane McCartney, with whom he had two children, Michael Gareth, b. 1970, and Sara Geneve, b. 1971. Linda Davey graduated from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1978 and practiced law in Toronto until 1994. She also served with Davey on the editorial board of the Coach House Press from 1976 to 1988. She died of a brain tumor in 2000. His memoir, &quot;How Linda Died&quot;, which contains many details of their life together and their relations with their children, is, according to &quot;BC Bookworld&quot; editor Alan Twigg, &#x27;Davey&#x27;s most accessible and memorable book ... his most atypically direct and personal.&#x27;

==Contributions to Poetry and Literary Criticism==

===Influence===
Davey has usually been viewed as a major influence on both Canadian poetry and Canadian literary criticism. Twigg has quoted George Fetherling as having called &quot;TISH&quot; Canada’s &#x27;most influential literary magazine.&#x27; Ken Norris, in his study of Canadian little magazines, calls Davey&#x27;s &quot;Open Letter&quot; &#x27;the most important avant-garde periodical in Canada.&#x27; Betts writes that &#x27; his books of poetry, his literary and cultural criticism and his rich range of essays on diverse topics, Davey has been a major figure involved in introducing the idea and practice of postmodernism to writers in Canada.&#x27; Scobie adds that he has &#x27;often been seen as a &#x27;poet&#x27;s poet&#x27; &#x27; (276).

===&quot;TISH&quot;===
Betts writes that &#x27;the TISH community has been described as the first post-colonial literary movement in English Canada because they wrote after and neither about nor because of colonialism.&#x27; Alexander Varty, reviewing &quot;When TISH Happens&quot; for &quot;The Georgia Straight&quot;, writes that it is possible &#x27;that TISH&#x27;s emphasis &#x27;on the self as a consciousness in process rather than a stable persona&#x27; has become the norm in Canadian poetry and indeed in much Canadian fiction – a significant contribution, and one that&#x27;s worth celebrating.&#x27;

===&#x27;Surviving the Paraphrase&#x27;===
Diana Brydon begins her introduction to the Frank Davey &#x27;festschrift issue&#x27; of &quot;Studies in Canadian Literature&quot;: &#x27;In 1974, Frank Davey&#x27;s conference paper &#x27;Surviving the Paraphrase&#x27; took the small world of Canadian literary criticism by storm. The tenor of discussion changed as writers and critics became more self-conscious about their place in the world and how they engaged it in their work.&#x27; In her essay in this issue, Smaro Kamboureli writes &#x27; &#x27;Surviving the Paraphrase,&#x27; originally presented in 1974 at the founding meeting of the association of Canadian and Quebec Literatures, and subsequently published in &quot;Canadian Literature&quot; in 1976, inaugurates a pivotal moment ... in the development of Canadian criticism, for it presents one of the earliest, albeit brief, critiques of thematic criticism in Canada.&#x27; She adds &#x27;If I were to identify a single major contribution Davey has made to Canadian critical discourse, this would be the instrumental role he has played in showing the importance of methodology, that methodology is inextricably related to how we understand the canon, textuality, the critical act, and nation-formation. The fact that he drew attention to method at a time when Canadian literary discourse was by and large oblivious to it makes his contribution all the more important. Method – directly thematized or appearing in different guises – figures in his work with remarkable consistency and with interesting results.&#x27;

===Poetry===
The poems of Davey’s first poetry collection, &quot;D-Day and After&quot;, described in Tallman’s introduction as &#x27;a weathervane pointing which way the verse winds may be blowing,&#x27; for the most part adapted the early projectivist poetics and typewriter spacing of Charles Olson to the lyric poem. It was mockingly reviewed by Ontario poet and playwright James Reaney – &#x27;I’m not too sure that instead of projecting himself through his typewriter, his typewriter isn&#x27;t projecting itself through him.&#x27; Two of the poems, however, &#x27;To the Lions Gate Bridge&#x27; and &#x27;The Guitar Girls,&#x27; are among the most successful processual poems produced by the Tish poets, with the former declared by Robert Duncan to be &#x27;a poem without lapse&#x27; In Davey&#x27;s next three books, &quot;Bridge Force&quot; (1965), &quot;City of the Gulls and Sea&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Scarred Hull&quot; (1966), Olson&#x27;s influence is evident mostly in the research-based focus on place, especially in the latter. All three rather undistinguished books only slightly declined the prevailing lyric conventions of Canadian poetry. But they also differed significantly from each other.

Davey&#x27;s emerging tendency to modify or enlarge his poetics with each new book or cluster of books became more apparent in his first four poetry books of the 1970s and their differing approaches to a phenomenological prosody. &quot;Weeds&quot; (1970) is a sequence of one-paragraph prose poems with frequent disjunctions between the sentences. &quot;The Clallam&quot; (1973) is a narrative of a 1907 British Columbia shipwreck constructed in brief exclamatory sections that recall the abrasive mock narratives of Jack Spicer. &quot;King of Swords&quot; (1972) retells much of the Arthurian story in contemporary diction to suggest the continuing persistence of that story&#x27;s self-destructive masculinism. &quot;Arcana&quot; (1973) uses longer lines, postmodern indeterminacy and the imagery of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck in purportedly unfinished &#x27;manuscript poems,&#x27; each dated and printed within quotation marks. All these books were outside, or alongside, usual Canadian poetry practices. The most visible Black Mountain influence in the latter two books was the medievalism of Robert Duncan, but much differently framed.

Davey published two strikingly unusual books in the 1980s. The first was &quot;Capitalistic Affection!&quot; (1982), in which a young boy absorbs sexual stereotypes in the weekly comic strips of the North American 1940s. The book uses comic strip idioms, mixed with occasional metafictional commentary, to analyze further the Arthurian inheritance and its imbrication with commodity culture, while also creating numerous disturbingly poignant moments. He followed this in 1986 with another anomalous work, &quot;The Abbotsford Guide to India&quot;, a book of poetry constructed as a tourist guide. Critic Katie Trumpener comments that &#x27;Davey&#x27;s &quot;Guide&quot; is a manifesto from Abbotsford about the connected perspectives and cultural cross-pollination of different peripheries,&#x27; one that &#x27;bypasses ... the empire&#x27;s nominal centre&#x27; and adds that the poems &#x27;point to the obvious vestiges of colonial consciousness in a still emphatically &quot;British&quot; Columbia (especially in the survival of colonial attitudes toward its own &#x27;Indians&#x27;), but they also identify more mysterious residues of colonial self-doubt and self-hatred.&#x27; Again these books had little relationship to the ongoing lyric norms of Canadian poetry or, in their sharp movements away from each of Davey’s preceding books, to the more consistent modes of poetic dissent being created by other Canadian poets such as bill bissett, Daphne Marlatt, and bpNichol. He also published in the 1980s the bitterly humorous &quot;Edward &amp; Patricia&quot; (1984) and the collection of poetic reorientations of Canadian history &quot;The Louis Riel Organ and Piano Company&quot; (1985). The latter contains Davey&#x27;s most frequently taught longer poem, &#x27;Riel,&#x27; a Spicerian deconstruction of the various narratives that have claimed to represent the Canadian Métis martyr.

In all these books there had been evident a strong interest in cultural criticism and semiotics, an interest which became central to his literary criticism in the early 1990s with the publication of his &quot;Post-National Arguments&quot; and &quot;Canadian Literary Power&quot;. Davey&#x27;s first poetry collection of the 1990s was the ironically titled &quot;Popular Narratives&quot; (1994), with its cover image of the Ljubljana statue of the Slovenian national poet France Prešeren being blessed by a beautiful muse but both covered in bird droppings. Among the book&#x27;s &#x27;popular&#x27; narratives were Davey&#x27;s story of the murder of Agnes Bernauer in fifteenth-century Bavaria and his prose-poem elegy for bpNichol into which he incorporates the stories of both Eloise and Abelard and Camille Claudel and Auguste Rodin as ones of teacher-student exploitation. As he had written in 1972 in &quot;King of Swords&quot;, &#x27;the myth of Arthur continues.&#x27; In 1996 he published the collection &quot;Cultural Mischief&quot;, with one of its poems a very different elegy to the painter Greg Curnoe, constructed of 32 short staccato stanzas that echo the disjunctive structure of Curnoe&#x27;s best-known paintings. It&#x27;s a poem that Lynette Hunter writes &#x27;not only erases the heroic elegiac voice but also textures the body of the dead.&#x27;

During the next few years and the illness and death of his wife, and his writing of &quot;How Linda Died&quot; (2002), Davey appears to have worked on the completing of a manuscript first published as the on-demand digital chapbook &quot;War Poems&quot; in 1979 and published as a much longer book, &quot;Back to the War&quot;, in 2005. The 75 poems narrate a childhood story of being on the &#x27;backside&#x27; of World War II but in a family that replicates much of that war’s tensions and gender metaphors, into which the child becomes an unknowing but inevitable conscript. On the cover is a photo of the battlecruisers &quot;HMS Hood&quot; and &quot;HMS Repulse&quot; in Vancouver harbour on which has been superimposed an amateur snapshot of a young boy in a British sailor suit. Like most of Davey&#x27;s books, including &quot;The Scarred Hull, Weeds, The Clallam, King of Swords, Capitalistic Affection!, Edward &amp; Patricia&quot;, and &quot;The Abbotsford Guide to India&quot;, the collection functions as both a long poem and a unified sequence of separable parts.

Davey takes up flarf techniques in his 2010 &quot;Bardy Google&quot;, manipulating internet algorithms to produce a variety of texts that portray the limitations and variety of internet culture. For many readers the most surprising of these has been &#x27;Sydney&#x27;s Wreck,&#x27; in which Davey&#x27;s algorithms produce a collage-narrative of the World War II disappearance and later location of the Australian light cruiser – a narrative in which the ideological investments of a wide range of Australians becomes evident. As usual, flarf throws a luminous spotlight on language usage. Here Davey uses it to extend the semiotics underpinnings of his &quot;Popular Narratives&quot; and &quot;Cultural Mischief&quot;. Davey&#x27;s 2014 collection &quot;Poems Suitable to Current Material Conditions&quot; is almost entirely (and mischievously) about language, from poems that riff on cliché phrases such as &#x27;I’m good,&#x27; &#x27;just sayin&#x27;,&#x27; and &#x27;going forward,&#x27; to a flarf poem that puns on Jacques Lacan’s name and theories to illuminate the feelings of lack and entitlement that societies both wealthy and poor repeatedly declare.

In a note written on &quot;Tish&quot; in 1991 Tallman writes that Davey&#x27;s magazine &quot;Open Letter&quot; can be viewed as standing for all the ventures of the &quot;Tish&quot; poets &#x27;as evidence of some active secret of the imagination original &quot;Tish&quot; let loose upon the world,&#x27; and that Davey can be viewed &#x27;as a type of all the other &quot;Tish&quot; poets who were in on the secret&#x27; – &#x27;that he exemplifies in himself how much imagination when possessed can manage.&#x27; Davey&#x27;s own imagination appears to have been strongly influenced by the events of the Second World War, from the title of his first collection through the comic strip images of the war in &quot;Capitalistic Affection!&quot;, his &#x27;multiple choice&#x27; Hiroshima poem of &quot;Cultural Mischief&quot;, the coloring book warfare and plastic war machines of &quot;Back to the War&quot;, to the colliding ideologies of HMAS &#x27;Sydney&#x27;s Wreck&#x27; in &quot;Bardy Google&quot;.

<doc id="255621" wikidata="Q232147" url="?curid=255621" title="Yolanda, Latin Empress">
<text>Yolanda (; 1175 – August 1219), often called Yolanda of Flanders, was Empress of the Latin Empire in Constantinople, first as the wife of Emperor Peter from 1216 to 1217 and thereafter as regent until her death in 1219. Peter was captured and imprisoned before he could reach Constantinople, so Yolanda assumed the duties of governing the Empire. She was ruling Marchioness of Namur from 1212 until 1217.

==Biography==
Yolanda was the daughter of Baldwin V, Count of Hainault, and Countess Margaret I of Flanders. Two of her brothers, Baldwin I and then Henry, were emperors in Constantinople. 

In 1212, Yolanda became Marchioness of Namur after her brother, Marquis Philip I. 

After the death of her brother emperor Henry in 1216 there was a brief period without an emperor, before Peter was elected to succeed her brother. 

Because of Salic Law, Yolande could not succeed to the throne, and her husband became emperor instead. 

On their way there, Peter sent Yolanda ahead to Constantinople, while he fought the Despotate of Epirus, during which he was captured. Because his fate was unknown (although he was probably killed), Yolanda governed Constantinople alone for two years.

 described her as a regent, but Filip Van Tricht described her as an empress in her own right.

She allied with the Bulgarians against the various Byzantine successor states, and was able to make peace with Theodore I Lascaris of the Empire of Nicaea, who married her daughter, Marie.

Her husband died after two years in prison, and she died herself in August 1219.

==Legacy==
Following Yolanda&#x27;s death, her second son, Robert of Courtenay, became emperor because her oldest son, Philip, did not want the throne. Robert was still in France at the time.

Yolanda was, in her own right, Marchioness of Namur, which she inherited from her brother, Marquis Philip I, in 1212 and left to her eldest son, Marquis Philip II, when she went to Constantinople in 1216.

==Issue==
By Peter of Courtenay she had 10 children:
* Philip (d. 1226), Marquis of Namur, who declined the offer of the crown of the Latin Empire
* Robert of Courtenay (d. 1228), Latin Emperor
* Henry (d. 1229), Marquis of Namur
* Baldwin II of Constantinople (d. 1273)
* Margaret, Marchioness of Namur, who married first Raoul d&#x27;Issoudun and then Henry count of Vianden
* Elizabeth, who married Walter (Gaucher) count of Bar and then Eudes sire of Montagu
* Yolanda, who married Andrew II of Hungary
* Eleanor, who married Philip of Montfort, Lord of Tyre
* Marie, who married Theodore I Lascaris of the Empire of Nicaea
* Agnes, who married Geoffrey II Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea

<doc id="255626" wikidata="Q13895" url="?curid=255626" title="Zambales">
<text>Zambales, officially the Province of Zambales (; ; ; ; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is Iba, which is located in the middle of the province. Olongapo is the largest city of the province wherein it is geographically located but politically independent.

Zambales borders Pangasinan to the north and northeast, Tarlac to the east, Pampanga to the southeast, Bataan to the south and the South China Sea to the west. With a total land area of (including the independent city of Olongapo), Zambales is the second largest among the seven provinces of Central Luzon after Nueva Ecija. The province is noted for its mangoes, which are abundant from January to April.

Zambales does not have a functional airport; the closest functional airport is Clark International Airport in Angeles City in the neighbouring province of Pampanga. Subic Bay International Airport, which is located in Cubi Point (geographically and politically located inside Morong, Bataan) in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone is no longer functional for domestic and international flights.

The Freeport Zone (SBFZ) is host to many tourist attractions which include casinos, parks, malls, beach-side huts, cottages and resorts, as well as historical sites.

==Etymology==
The name of the province is derived from &quot;Zambales&quot;, the Hispanized name of the Sambal people. The Sambal were the original dominant ethnic group of the region.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
The Spanish first explored the area in 1572, led by Juan de Salcedo. Off Cape Bolinao (now part of Pangasinan), he and his men liberated a Zambal chieftain and his followers from a Chinese pirate ship. This act gained the natives&#x27; goodwill. Shortly thereafter, the province was organized. Among the earliest towns founded were Subic (1572), Botolan (1572), Masinloc (1607), Iba (1611), and Santa Cruz (1612). Zambales was originally derived from 2 parts: the southern area from Pampanga and the northern area from Pangasinan.

During the Spanish period, a 1774 map was made, which clearly named Scarborough Shoals as &quot;Panacot Shoal&quot;, a feature under complete sovereignty of Spanish Philippines, specifically of Zambales. The shoal&#x27;s current name was chosen by Captain Philip D&#x27;Auvergne, whose East India Company East Indiaman &quot;Scarborough&quot; briefly grounded on one of the rocks on September 12, 1784, before sailing on to China. When the Philippines was granted independence in the 19th century and 20th century, Scarborough Shoal was passed by the colonial governments to the sovereign Republic of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joseph Huddart 1801 https://books.google.com/books?id=FbwBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA454 454&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1700s, Zambales had 1,136 native families and 73 Spanish Filipino families.

===American invasion era===
Masinloc became the province&#x27;s first capital. However, the capital was moved among the last three towns above during its history before finally settling in Iba, due to its strategic location. Seven of the province&#x27;s original northern towns, which included Bolinao, Infanta, San Isidro, now Burgos, Anda, Bani, Agno and Alaminos were later transferred under the jurisdiction of Pangasinan because of their distance from the capital. The first civil governor of Zambales during the colonial American era was Potenciano Lesaca from 1901 to 1903.

=== Postwar Era ===
Under a 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the Philippines granted the United States a 99-year lease on several U.S. bases, including U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. A later amendment in 1966 reduced the original 99-year term of the agreement to 25 years. A renewal of the agreement in 1979 allowed the U.S. to continue operating the bases until November 1991, when the Philippine Senate rejected a bill for the renewal of U.S. bases in the Philippines.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===

The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Zambales. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. 

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. During the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, Zambales was one of the most militarized areas. Among the Zambales activists who were killed by the Marcos regime during this time were Ellecer Cortes, Dennis Deveraturda, and Butch Landrito - all of whom were later recognized at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani memorial for resisting the Marcos regime&#x27;s assault on democracy.

In Olongapo, the continuation of the Vietnam war through this period meant the arrival of a constantly growing number of U.S. Sailors to Subic Naval Base, and along with it, the rapid growth of prostitution. The policies of the Marcos administration encouraged the growth of the sex-industry because it increased the flow of higher value currency into the Philippine economy. The economy of this part of Zambales evolved from a largely agricultural orientation at the end of the 1960s towards one built around sex industry related businesses such as bars by the mid-1970s.

In 1986, the province was one of the main supporters of the People Power Revolution in Manila, which topped the 21-year dictatorship and installed Corazon Aquino as president, bringing back democracy to the country.

===Later 20th Century===
The province was heavily affected by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Due to this, the economy of the province weakened for some time, but regained vitality a few years after the government ordered the revitalization of the province and established growth in its southern towns, which later became a significant economic zone in the country by 1995.

===Contemporary===
The 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff led to a situation where access to the shoal was restricted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. However, in 2016, following meetings between the Philippine president Duterte and his PRC counterparts, the PRC allowed Filipino fishermen to access the shoals for fishing.

In 2018, it was revealed that for every 3,000 peso worth of fish catch by Sambal fisherfolks, China siphoned them in exchange for &#x27;two bottles of mineral water&#x27; worth 20 pesos. The revelations led to public unrest against China and the Duterte-administered Philippine government. Filipino president Rodrigo Duterte fired back against his fellow Filipinos, including those from Zambales, saying that China&#x27;s acts were &#x27;fine&#x27; as they were &#x27;only barter&#x27;. On June 14, 2018, China&#x27;s destruction of Scarborough Shoal&#x27;s reefs surged to an extent which they became visible via Google Earth and Philippine satellites, as confirmed by the University of the Philippines Diliman.

==Geography==

Zambales lies on the western shores of Luzon island along the South China Sea. Its shoreline is rugged and features many coves and inlets. The Zambales Mountains in the eastern length of the province occupies about 60% of the total land area of Zambales. Subic Bay, at the southern end of the province, provides a natural harbor, and was the location of the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay until its closure in 1992.

The summit and crater lake of Mount Pinatubo lies within Botolan municipality in Zambales, near the tripoint of Zambales, Pampanga and Tarlac provinces. This volcano, once considered dormant, erupted violently in June 1991. The former summit of the volcano was obliterated by the massive eruption and replaced by a wide caldera, within which Lake Pinatubo is situated. With an average depth of , Lake Pinatubo is the deepest lake in the Philippines. The highest point of the caldera rim is above sea level, some lower than the pre-eruption summit. A vast portion of the Zambales province acquired desert-like features in 1991, after being buried by more than of lahar.

===Climate===
Zambales has two pronounced seasons: dry from October to June, and wet from July to September.

===Administrative divisions===
Zambales comprises 13 municipalities and one highly urbanized city, which are divided into two legislative districts. Olongapo City is a highly urbanized city and administers itself autonomously from the province. Panatag Shoal (Scarborough Shoal) a Philippine-claimed territory, is a designated part of the province.

The northern half of the province typically comprises the municipalities of Santa Cruz, Candelaria, Masinloc, and Palauig.

===Inhabitants===
The Aetas of Mount Pinatubo were the earliest inhabitants of what is now the province of Zambales. They were later displaced by the Sambal, an Austronesian people after whom the province is named. Many Sambal still believe in superstitions and mysteries that have been handed down through the generations.

The Tagalogs, the Ilocanos, the Sambal, the Kapampangans, and the Pangasinans today constitute the five largest ethnic groups in Zambales; these identities may and do, however, overlap with one another due to intermarriage and other factors. The less-populated valley of the province was settled by settlers from the Ilocos and the Tagalog regions, leading to the assimilation of Sambals to Ilocano &amp; Tagalog settlers &amp; modern decline in the Sambal cultural identity and language. Most of the people of southern Zambales are migrants from different parts of the country, owing the influx of job opportunities brought on by the U.S Subic Naval Base (San Antonio and Subic) during the American regime of the country. Many people found jobs and permanently settled there. The presence of the Americans greatly influenced the culture and way of life of the inhabitants.

<doc id="255627" wikidata="Q321470" url="?curid=255627" title="List of capitals in the United States">
<text>This is a list of capital cities of the United States, including places that serve or have served as federal, state, insular area, territorial, colonial and Native American capitals.

Washington, D.C. has been the federal capital of the United States since 1800. Each U.S. state has its own capital city, as do many of its insular areas. Most states have not changed their capital city since becoming a state, but the capital cities of their respective preceding colonies, territories, kingdoms, and republics typically changed multiple times. There have also been other governments within the current borders of the United States with their own capitals, such as the Republic of Texas, Native American nations, and other unrecognized governments.

== National capitals ==

The buildings in cities identified in the chart below served either as official capitals of the United States under the United States Constitution, or, prior to its ratification, sites where the Second Continental Congress or Congress of the Confederation met. The United States did not have a permanent capital under the Articles of Confederation.

The U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1787, and gave the Congress the power to exercise &quot;exclusive legislation&quot; over a district that &quot;may, by Cession of particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States.&quot; The 1st Congress met at Federal Hall in New York. In 1790, it passed the Residence Act, which established the national capital at a site along the Potomac River that would become Washington, D.C. For the next ten years, Philadelphia served as the temporary capital. There, Congress met at Congress Hall. On November 17, 1800, the 6th United States Congress formally convened in Washington, D.C. Congress has met outside of Washington only twice since: on July 16, 1987, at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of ratification of the Constitution; and at Federal Hall National Memorial in New York on September 6, 2002, to mark the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Both meetings were ceremonial.
==State capitals==
Each state has a capital that serves as the seat of its government. Ten of the thirteen original states and 15 other states have changed their capital city at least once; the last state to move its capital city was Oklahoma in 1910.

In the following table, the &quot;Since&quot; column shows the year that the city began serving as the state&#x27;s capital (or the capital of the entities that preceded it). The MSA/μSA and CSA columns display the population of the metro area the city is a part of, and should not be construed to mean the population of the city&#x27;s sphere of influence or that the city is an anchor for the metro area. Fields colored light yellow denote that the population is a micropolitan statistical area.

==Insular area capitals==
An insular area is a United States territory that is neither a part of one of the fifty states nor a part of the District of Columbia, the nation&#x27;s federal district. Those insular areas with territorial capitals are listed below.

==Former national capitals==
Four of the 50 U.S. states, Hawaii, Texas, California, and Vermont, were once &quot;de jure&quot; sovereign states with diplomatic recognition from the international community. California did not have a capital during its time as a sovereign nation.

===Hawaii===
During its history as a sovereign nation (Kingdom of Hawaii, 1795–1893; Republic of Hawaii, 1894–1898), five sites served as the capital of Hawaii:

* Waikīkī, 1795–1796
* Hilo, 1796–1803
* Honolulu, 1803–1812
* Kailua-Kona, 1812–1820
* Lahaina, 1820–1845
* Honolulu, 1845–1898
Annexed by the United States in 1898, Honolulu remained the capital, first of the Territory of Hawaii (1900–1959), and then of the state (since 1959).

===Texas===
During its history as a sovereign nation (Republic of Texas, 1836–1845), seven sites served as the capital of Texas:
* Washington (now Washington-on-the-Brazos), 1836
* Harrisburg (now part of Houston), 1836
* Galveston, 1836
* Velasco, 1836
* West Columbia, 1836
* Houston, 1837–1839
* Austin, 1839–1845
Annexed by the United States in 1845, Austin remains the capital of the state of Texas.

===Vermont===
Three sites have served as the capital of the Vermont Republic:
*Westminster, 1777
*Windsor, 1777–1791
*Castleton, 1791
When the state was admitted to the Union in 1791, Burlington was chosen to be the capital and it remained as such until 1805, when it was changed to Montpelier, where it remains today.

== Native American capitals ==

Some Native American tribes, in particular the Five Civilized Tribes, organized their states with constitutions and capitals in Western style. Others, like the Iroquois, had long-standing, pre-Columbian traditions of a &#x27;capitol&#x27; longhouse where wampum and council fires were maintained with special status. Since they did business with the U.S. Federal Government, these capitals can be seen as officially recognized in some sense.

=== Cherokee Nation ===
* New Echota 1825–1832
New Echota, now near Calhoun, Georgia, was founded in 1825, realizing the dream and plans of Cherokee Chief Major Ridge. Major Ridge chose the site because of its centrality in the historic Cherokee Nation which spanned parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama, and because it was near the confluence of the Conasauga and Coosawattee rivers. The town&#x27;s layout was partly inspired by Ridge&#x27;s many visits to Washington D.C. and to Baltimore, but also invoked traditional themes of the Southeastern ceremonial complex. Complete with the Council House, Supreme Court, Cherokee syllabary printing press, and the houses of several of the Nation&#x27;s constitutional officers, New Echota served as the capital until 1832 when the state of Georgia outlawed Native American assembly in an attempt to undermine the Nation. Thousands of Cherokee would gather in New Echota for the annual National Councils, camping along the nearby rivers and holding long stomp dances in the park-like woods that were typical of many Southeastern Native American settlements.

* Red Clay 1832–1838
The Cherokee National council grounds were moved to Red Clay, Tennessee, on the Georgia state line, in order to evade the Georgia state militia. The log cabins, limestone springs, and park-like woods of Red Clay served as the capital until the Cherokee Nation was removed to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) on the Trail of Tears. 
* Tahlequah 1839–1907, 1938–present
Tahlequah, in present-day Oklahoma, served as the capital of the original Cherokee Nation after Removal. After the Civil War, a turbulent period for the Nation which was involved in its own civil war resulting from pervasive anger and disagreements over removal from Georgia, the Cherokee Nation built a new National Capitol in Tahlequah out of brick. The building served as the capitol until 1907, when the Dawes Act finally dissolved the Cherokee Nation and Tahlequah became the county seat of Cherokee County, Oklahoma. The Cherokee National government was re-established in 1938 and Tahlequah remains the capital of the modern Cherokee Nation; it is also the capital of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.
* Cherokee 20th century–present (Eastern Band of Cherokee)
Approximately four to eight hundred Cherokees escaped removal because they lived on a separated tract, purchased later with the help of Confederate Colonel William Holland Thomas, along the Oconaluftee River deep in the Smoky Mountains of North Carolina. Some Cherokees fleeing the Federal Army, sent for the &quot;round up&quot;, fled to the remote settlements separated from the rest of the Cherokee Territory in Georgia and North Carolina, in order to remain in their homeland. In the 20th century, their descendants organized as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians; its capital is at Cherokee, North Carolina, in the tribally-controlled Qualla Boundary.

=== Muscogee Creek Nation ===
* Hot Springs, Arkansas –1866
After Removal from their Alabama-Georgia homeland, the Creek national government met near Hot Springs which was then part of their new territory as prescribed in the Treaty of Cusseta. Because some Creeks fought with the Confederacy in the American Civil War, the Union forced the Creeks to cede over - half of their land in what is now Arkansas.
* Okmulgee 1867–1906
Served as the National capital after the American Civil War. It was probably named after Ocmulgee, on the Ocmulgee river in Macon, a principle Coosa and later Creek town built with mounds and functioning as part of the Southeastern ceremonial complex. However, there were other traditional Creek &quot;mother-towns&quot; before removal. The Ocmulgee mounds were ceded illegally in 1821 with the Treaty of Indian Springs.

=== Iroquois Confederacy ===
* Onondaga (Onondaga privilege –present)
The Iroquois Confederacy or Haudenosaunee, which means &quot;People of the Longhouse&quot;, was an alliance between the Five and later Six-Nations of Iroquoian language and culture of upstate New York. These include the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and, after 1722, the Tuscarora Nations. Since the Confederacy&#x27;s formation around 1450, the Onondaga Nation has held privilege of hosting the Iroquois Grand Council and the status of Keepers of the Fire and the Wampum —which they still do at the official Longhouse on the Onondaga Reservation. Now spread over reservations in New York and Ontario, the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee preserve this arrangement to this day in what they claim to be the &quot;world&#x27;s oldest representative democracy.&quot;

==== Seneca Nation of Indians ====
* Jimerson Town (Allegany Reservation)
* Irving (Cattaraugus Reservation)

The Seneca Nation republic was founded in 1848 and has two capitals that rotate responsibilities every two years. Jimerson Town was founded in the 1960s following the formation of the Allegheny Reservoir. The Senecas also have an administrative longhouse in Steamburg but do not consider that location to be a capital.

===Navajo Nation===
* Window Rock
Window Rock (Navajo: &quot;Tségháhoodzání&quot;), Arizona, is a small city that serves as the seat of government and capital of the Navajo Nation (1936–present), the largest territory of a sovereign Native American nation in North America. It lies within the boundaries of the St. Michaels Chapter, adjacent to the Arizona and New Mexico state line. Window Rock hosts the Navajo Nation governmental campus which contains the Navajo Nation Council, Navajo Nation Supreme Court, the offices of the Navajo Nation President and Vice President, and many Navajo government buildings.

==Unrecognized national capitals==
There have been a handful of self-declared or undeclared nations within the current borders of the United States which were never officially recognized as legally independent sovereign entities; however, these nations did have &quot;de facto&quot; control over their respective regions during their existence.

===Colonies of British America===

Prior to the independence of the United States from Great Britain, declared July 4, 1776 in the Declaration of Independence and ultimately secured in the American Revolutionary War, several congresses were convened on behalf of some of the colonies of British America. However, these bodies did not address the question of independence from England, and therefore did not designate a national capital. The Second Continental Congress encompassed the period during which the United States declared independence, but had not yet established a permanent national capital.
===Vermont Republic===
Before joining the United States as the fourteenth state, Vermont was an independent republic known as the Vermont Republic (1777–1791). Three cities served as the capital of the Republic:
*Westminster, 1777
*Windsor, 1777–?
*Castleton, ?–1791

The current capital of the State of Vermont is Montpelier.

===State of Franklin===
The State of Franklin was an autonomous, secessionist United States territory created not long after the end of the American Revolution from territory that later was ceded by North Carolina to the federal government. Franklin&#x27;s territory later became part of the state of Tennessee. Franklin was never officially admitted into the Union of the United States and existed for only four years.
*Jonesborough, Tennessee, 1784–1785
*Greeneville, Tennessee, 1785–1788

===State of Muskogee===
The State of Muskogee was a Native American state in Spanish Florida created by the Englishman William Augustus Bowles, who was its &quot;Director General&quot;, author of its Constitution, and designer of its flag. It consisted of several tribes of Creeks and Seminoles. It existed from 1799 to 1803. It had one capital:
*Miccosukee, 1799–1803

===Republic of West Florida===
The Republic of West Florida was a short-lived nation that broke away from the territory of Spanish West Florida in 1810. It comprised the Florida Parishes of the modern state of Louisiana and the Mobile District of the modern states of Mississippi and Alabama. (The Republic of West Florida did not include any part of the modern state of Florida.) Ownership of the area had been in dispute between Spain and the United States, which claimed that it had been included in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Within two months of the settlers&#x27; rebellion and the declaration of an independent nation, President James Madison sent American forces to peaceably occupy the new republic. It was formally annexed by the United States in 1812 over the objections of Spain and the land was divided between the Territory of Orleans and Territory of Mississippi. During its brief existence, the capital of the Republic of West Florida was:
*St. Francisville, Louisiana, 1810

===Republic of Indian Stream===
The Republic of Indian Stream was an unrecognized independent nation within the present state of New Hampshire.
*The area that would become Pittsburg, New Hampshire, 1832–1835

===California Republic===
Before being annexed by the United States in 1848 (following the Mexican–American War), a small portion of north-central California declared itself the California Republic, in an act of independence from Mexico, in 1846 (see Bear Flag Revolt). The republic only existed a month before it disbanded itself to join the advancing American army; its claimed territory later became part of the United States as a result of the Mexican Cession.

The very short-lived California Republic was never recognized by the United States, Mexico or any other nation. The flag, featuring a silhouette of a California grizzly bear, a star, and the words &quot;California Republic&quot;, became known as the Bear Flag and was later the basis for the official state flag of California.

There was one &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the California Republic:
*Sonoma, 1846
===Confederate States===

The Confederate States of America (C.S.A.) had three capitals during its existence. The first capital was established February 4, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama, and remained there until it was moved to Richmond, Virginia, on May 29, 1861, after Virginia seceded on May 23.

The individual state capitals remained the same in the Confederacy as they had been in the Union (U.S.A.), although as the advancing Union Army used those cities for military districts, some of the Confederate governments were relocated or moved out of state, traveling along with secessionist armies.

* Montgomery, Alabama, February 4, 1861 – May 29, 1861
* Richmond, Virginia, May 29, 1861 – April 3, 1865
* Danville, Virginia, April 2, 1865- May 10, 1865
====Free State of Jones====
In 1863 and 1864, Jones County, Mississippi revolted against Confederate rule and became practically independent under the name Free State of Jones. The Free State fought a number of skirmishes with Confederate troops. By the spring of 1864 the Jones County rebels had taken effective control of the county from the Confederate government, raised an American flag over the courthouse in Ellisville, and sent a letter to Union General William T. Sherman declaring Jones County&#x27;s independence from the Confederacy.

Scholars have disputed whether the county truly seceded, with some concluding it did not fully secede. Lack of documentation makes the situation difficult to assess. The rebellion in Jones County has been variously characterized as consisting of local skirmishes to being a full-fledged war of independence.

*Ellisville, Mississippi

==Historical state, colonial, and territorial capitals==
Most of the original Thirteen Colonies had their capitals occupied or attacked by the British during the American Revolutionary War. State governments operated where and as they could. The City of New York was occupied by British troops from 1776 to 1783. A similar situation occurred during the War of 1812, during the American Civil War in many Confederate states, and during the Pueblo Revolt of 1680–1692 in New Mexico.

Twenty-two state capitals have been a capital longer than their state has been a state, since they served as the capital of a predecessor territory, colony, or republic. Boston, Massachusetts, has been a capital city since 1630; it is the oldest continuously running capital in the United States. Santa Fe, New Mexico, is the oldest capital city, having become capital in 1610 and interrupted only by the aforementioned Pueblo Revolt. An even older Spanish city, St. Augustine, Florida, served as a colonial capital from 1565 until about 1820, more than 250 years.

The table below includes the following information:
#The state, the year in which statehood was granted, and the state&#x27;s capital are shown in bold type. NOTE: For the first thirteen states, formerly the Thirteen Colonies of Great Britain on the Atlantic seaboard, the year of statehood is shown as 1776 (United States Declaration of Independence) rather than the subsequent year each state ratified the 1787 United States Constitution. (See List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union.) 
#The year listed for each capital is the starting date; the ending date is the starting date for the successor unless otherwise indicated.
#In many cases, capital cities of historical jurisdictions were outside of a state&#x27;s present borders. (Those cities are generally indicated with the two-letter abbreviation for the U.S. state in which the former administrative capital is now located.)

<text>Tarlac, officially the Province of Tarlac (; ; ; ; ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is the city of Tarlac, which is the most populous in the province. It is bounded on the north by the province of Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija on the east, Zambales on the west, and Pampanga in the south. The province comprises three congressional districts and is subdivided into 17 municipalities and one city, Tarlac City, which is the provincial capital.

The province is situated in the heartland of Luzon, in what is known as the Central Plain also spanning the neighbouring provinces of Pampanga, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, and Zambales. Tarlac covers a total land area of .

Early in history, what came to be known as Valenzuela Ranch today was once a thickly-forested area, peopled by roving tribes of nomadic Aetas who are said to be the aboriginal settlers of the Philippines, and for a lengthy period, it was the remaining hinterland of Luzon&#x27;s Central Plains. Today, Tarlac is one of the most multi-cultural provinces in the region for having a mixture of four distinct ethnic groups: the Kapampangans, the Pangasinans, the Ilocanos, and the Tagalogs. It is also known for its fine food and vast sugar and rice plantations in Central Luzon.

==History==

=== Spanish colonial era ===
Tarlac&#x27;s name is a Hispanized derivation from a &quot;talahib&quot; weed called &quot;tarlak&quot;, an Aeta term. The area around the current capital city was described as &quot;matarlak&quot; or &quot;malatarlak&quot;, a word meaning &quot;abundant with &quot;tarlak&quot; grass.&quot; Tarlac was originally divided into two parts: the southern division belonging to Pampanga and the northern division belonging to Pangasinan; the province was named after the present capital city. It was the last province in Central Luzon to be organized under the Spanish colonial administration in 1874. Its nucleus were the towns of Concepcion, Capas, Bamban, Mabalacat, Magalang, Porac, Floridablanca, Victoria, and Tarlac which constituted a military comandancia. Some of these municipalities were returned to Pampanga but the rest were incorporated into the new province of Tarlac.

Unlike other provinces in Central Luzon, Tarlac was relatively free from revolts during the Spanish regime before the late 1800s rose. Only the rebellion started by Juan de la Cruz Palaris in Pangasinan spread to the northern portion of Tarlac.

====Philippine revolution====
During the Philippine Revolution of 1896, Tarlac was among the first eight provinces to rise against Spain, alongside neighbouring Pampanga. It became the new seat of the first Philippine Republic in March 1899 when General Emilio Aguinaldo abandoned the former capital, Malolos, Bulacan. This lasted only for a month before the seat was moved to Nueva Ecija in Aguinaldo&#x27;s attempt to elude the pursuing Americans.

===American invasion era===
On October 23, 1899, Gregorio Aglipay, military vicar general of the revolutionary forces, called the Filipino clergy to a conference in Paniqui. There, they drafted the constitution of the Philippine Independent Church. They called for the Filipinization of the clergy, which eventually led to a separation from the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines.

Tarlac was captured by American forces in November 1899. A civil government was established in the province in 1901.

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, Camp O&#x27;Donnell in Capas became the terminal point of the infamous Bataan Death March of Filipino and American soldiers who surrendered at Bataan on April 9, 1942. Many prisoners died of hunger, disease and/or execution. The general headquarters of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was established from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 3rd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was founding again from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, and military stationed in the province of Tarlac and some parts in Central Luzon due to Japanese occupation. Local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units sent the clearing military operations in the province of Tarlac and Central Luzon from 1942 to 1945 and aided them by the recognized guerrilla groups including Hukbalahap Communist fighters and attacking Japanese Imperial forces. But in the aftermath, some local guerrilla resistance fighters and Hukbahalap groups became retreating Imperial Japanese troops around the province and before the liberation from the Allied forces.

In early 1945, combined American and Filipino military forces with the recognized Aringay Command guerrillas liberated Camp O&#x27;Donnell. The raid in Capas resulted in the rescue of American, Filipino and other allied Prisoners of War.

From January 20, 1945, to August 15, 1945, Tarlac was recaptured by combined Filipino and American troops together with the recognized guerrilla fighters against the Japanese Imperial forces during the liberation and beginning for the Battle of Tarlac under the Luzon Campaign.

===Postwar era===
After the social and economic upheavals of the war and with government institutions still in their nascent form after the recognition of Philippine Independence by the international community, the first few decades after the end of the war were marked by dissatisfaction and social tension. In the largely agricultural context of Central Luzon and Tarlac those tensions tended to coalesce around the interrelated issues of land ownership, and the working conditions of agricultural workers.

The Filipino communist Hukbalahap guerrilla movement formed by the farmers of Central Luzon to fight the Japanese occupation, had found themselves sidelined by the new post-independence Philippine government which had taken up the fear of communist influence which marked the beginning of the cold war in the west. So they decided to extended their fight into a rebellion against the new government, only to be put down through a series of reforms and military victories by Defense Secretary, and later President, Ramon Magsaysay.

Ultimately more effective than those who took up arms were the numerous political and labor movements who kept working towards agricultural land reform and stronger labor rights, with laborers&#x27; and farmers&#x27; protests gathering enough steam that several Philippine presidents were forced to meet with them and then concede to their demands. Among the most successful of these were the Land Justice March of the political group known as the Filipino Agrarian Reform Movement (FARM), which intended to march from Tarlac to Malacañang in 1969, although President Marcos was forced to give in to their demands early, meeting them while they were still at Camp Servillano Aquino in Tarlac City itself.

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in Tarlac. During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of foreign debt-funded public works projects. This caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and a significant rise of social unrest. 

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. At least two major military camps in Tarlac were used as detention centers for political detainees in Tarlac: Camp Servillano Aquino and Camp Macabulos, both in Tarlac City. They were part of Regional Command for Detainees II (RECAD II) and administered under Camp Olivas in Pampanga.

Martial Law had immediate political impacts in Tarlac, since political leaders who were critical of Marcos were immediately jailed. This included Senator and Concepcion native Ninoy Aquino, and Bamban Mayor Pedro D. Mendiola who was imprisoned in Camp Crame. Other Tarlaqueño Marcos critics who had roles in government, such as Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) executive vice president Horacio Morales, tried to stay so they could pursue change from within, but eventually could not reconcile themselves with the idea of working within the dictatorship. Ordinary Tarlaqueños also resisted the dictatorship. Former Seminarian Teresito Sison campaigned for the rights of teachers, farmers, and of laborers in Clark Air Base, but torture during two stints in Marcos&#x27; detention centers caused a decline in his health until he died in 1980. Tarlaqueno activists decided to take up arms against the dicgtatorhip, including Eduardo Aquino, Merardo Arce, and Benedicto Pasetes were killed in various encounters with Marcos&#x27; forces.

Ninoy Aquino was eventually assassinated in August 1983, igniting protests throughout the Philippines which would eventually force Marcos to announce a snap election in February 1986. Even then, those who resisted Marcos were targeted for death, such as in the case of oppositionist campaign organizer Jeremias De Jesus political organizer, who was assassinated shortly before the elections 

===Contemporary===
====Military testing ground====
The Philippine Army has used Crow Valley in the borders of Barangay Patling and Santa Lucia in Capas, Tarlac as a testing ground for both Philippine forces and allies. Many of the Philippine military testings were done on March 17, 2006, most likely as a part of Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines.

Tarlac plays a big role in the annual joint Balikatan Exercise as it is a main exercise ground of the USA and Philippine Army. 

The exercise in Tarlac conducts Combat exercise including Aviation, Artillery and Small Arms training. It is conducted in Crow Valley in Capas, Tarlac. Since 2022 with more than 10,000+ Military Personnel and increasing.

==Geography==

The landlocked province is situated at the center of the central plains of Luzon, landlocked by four provinces: Pampanga on the south, Nueva Ecija on the east, Pangasinan on the north, and Zambales on the west. The province covers a total area of . Approximately 75% of the province is plains while the rest is hilly to slightly mountainous.

Eastern Tarlac is a plain, while Western Tarlac is hilly to slightly mountainous. Because of this, the province includes a large portion of mountains like Mt. Telakawa (Straw Hat Mountain), located at Capas, Tarlac. Mt. Bueno, Mt. Mor-Asia and Mt. Canouman are also located in Capas as well as Mt. Dalin. The other mountains are Mt. Dueg and Mt. Maasin, found in the municipality of San Clemente. Also noted are Mt. Damas of Camiling. A portion of Mount Pinatubo (whose summit crater rests in neighbouring Zambales) also rests in Bamban and Capas. The whole of Mayantoc and San Jose are mountainous so it is suitable for the highest natural resources and forest products in the province such as coal, iron, copper, temperate-climate fruits and vegetables, fire logs, sand, rocks and forest animals such as wild boar and deer. The main water sources for agriculture include the Tarlac River at Tarlac City, the Lucong and Parua rivers in Concepcion, Sacobia-Bamban River in Bamban and the Rio Chico in La Paz.

===Administrative divisions===
Tarlac is subdivided into 17 municipalities and one component city, all encompassed by three congressional districts. There are a total of 511 barangays comprising the province.


===Barangays===
The 17 municipalities and 1 city of the province comprise a total of 511 barangays, with Cristo Rey in Capas as the most populous in 2010, and Malonzo in Bamban as the least.

===Climate===

==Economy==

The economy of Tarlac is predominantly agricultural. It is among the biggest producers of rice and sugarcane (the principal crops) in Central Luzon. Other major crops are corn and coconuts, fruits (bananas, calamansi and mangoes) and vegetables (eggplants, garlic and onions).

Because the province is landlocked, its fish production is limited to fishpens, but it has vast river systems and irrigation. On the Zambales boundary to its west, forest land provides timber for the logging industry. Mineral reserves such as manganese and iron can also be found along the western section.

Tarlac has its own rice and corn mills, sawmills and logging outfits. It has three sugar-refining centrals and hosts many sugar products in Central Luzon, especially the Muscovado sugar of the municipality of Victoria. Other firms service agricultural needs such as fertilizers. Among its cottage industries, ceramics has become available because of the abundant supply of clay. Some of the major industries here involve making chicharon (pork skin chips) and iniruban in the municipality of Camiling and Ilang-Ilang products of Anao.

===Belenismo sa Tarlac===
&quot;Belenismo sa Tarlac&quot; was launched by Isabel Cojuangco-Suntay, sister of former Ambassador Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., to transform the province into the &quot;Belén capital of the Philippines&quot;. The Belen Festival began in September 2007, with the first Belen-making workshop conducted on December 16, 2007. Organizers have intended the festival to become an annual event in the province. Senator Loren Legarda led the awarding of the first Belen-making competition where Tarlac PNP Office Belen, built by at least 24 policemen, won the first prize.

Belenismo in Spanish means the art of making Belén, a representation of the Nativity scene in which the Holy Family (Joseph, Mary and the infant Jesus) is visited by the three wise men who came to the manger through the guidance of a star.

===Chicharon Iniruban Festival===
This annual festival is celebrated in the town of Camiling, during the last week of October. It is intended as a preparation for All Saints&#x27; Day and a Thanksgiving celebration for the good harvest and meat products, especially the &quot;chicharon&quot; or Bagnet. It also features the exotic and delicious rice cake &quot;iniruban&quot;, as called by the Ilocanos. The festival&#x27;s highlights are the street dancing competition, Miss Iniruban beauty pageant, and the municipality&#x27;s agri-trade. It is the oldest cultural celebration in the province, introduced in 2000.

==Provincial capital==
The highest seat of political power of the province is located on a hill in Barangay San Vicente, Tarlac City. The present structure was finished in 1909. During the Japanese occupation, the provincial capitol was vacated and used as the provincial headquarters of the Imperial Army.

<text>Ladytron are an English-based electronic band formed in Liverpool in 1999. The group consists of Scottish lead singer Helen Marnie (lead vocals, synthesizers), Bulgarian-Israeli Mira Aroyo (vocals, synthesizers), and Englishman Daniel Hunt (synthesizers, guitar, vocals). Reuben Wu (synthesizers) was a member from 1999 until 2023. They have released seven studio albums: &quot;604&quot; (2001), &quot;Light &amp; Magic&quot; (2002), &quot;Witching Hour&quot; (2005), &quot;Velocifero&quot; (2008), &quot;Gravity the Seducer&quot; (2011), &quot;Ladytron&quot; (2019) and &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot; (2023). They also issued the live album &quot;Live at London Astoria 16.07.08&quot; in 2009 and the compilation album &quot;Best of 00–10&quot; in 2011. They have produced remixes for artists such as Dave Gahan, Erasure, Goldfrapp, Apoptygma Berzerk, Placebo, Blondie, Gang of Four, Christina Aguilera, Nine Inch Nails, Bloc Party, Kings of Convenience, Soulwax and Róisín Murphy.

The band&#x27;s name was taken from the song &quot;Ladytron&quot; by Roxy Music. Former Roxy Music member Brian Eno said in 2009, &quot;Ladytron are, for me, the best of English pop music. They&#x27;re the kind of band that really only appears in England, with this funny mixture of eccentric art-school dicking around and dressing up, with a full awareness of what&#x27;s happening everywhere musically, which is kind of knitted together and woven into something quite new.&quot; Ladytron described their sound as &quot;electronic pop&quot;, while music journalists have also described their sound as synth-pop, electronic rock, post-punk, and new wave, among other genres. Some of the group&#x27;s songs contain lyrics written by Aroyo in her native Bulgarian.

==History==
===Band formation and debut single===
Liverpudlian producers and DJs Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu met in the 1990s. Hunt was a member of the bands Venini and Jules Verne and also founded the indie record label Invicta Hi-Fi and a nightclub. Wu trained in Industrial Design at Sheffield Hallam University and graduated in 1997. He became an industrial designer at Team Consulting Limited, until finally going full-time with the band around 2002.

Using a moniker inspired by the song &quot;Ladytron&quot; by Roxy Music, Hunt and Wu recorded the debut single &quot;He Took Her to a Movie&quot; for £50 with the guest vocalist Lisa Eriksson (who later formed the band Techno Squirrels) and released it in July 1999.

In the summer of 1999, Hunt and Wu met Scottish student Helen Marnie through various DJ gigs, and Bulgarian-Israeli Mira Aroyo through a mutual friend. Marnie and Aroyo joined the band as vocalists and keyboardists. Helen Marnie studied music at the University of Liverpool where she received a Bachelor of Arts in pop music in 1999. Mira Aroyo was a postgraduate research geneticist in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford.

===First EPs and &quot;604&quot; (1999–2001)===
During 1999 and 2001 Ladytron released the EPs &quot;Miss Black and Her Friends&quot; in December 1999 exclusively in Japan, &quot;Commodore Rock&quot; in June 2000, &quot;Mu-Tron EP&quot; in October 2000 and the singles &quot;Play Girl / Commodore Rock&quot; in 2000, &quot;Playgirl&quot; in 2000 and again in 2001, &quot;The Way That I Found You&quot; in 2001. All the songs (except &quot;Miss Black&quot;, &quot;Olivetti Jerk&quot; and the remixes) from these releases were later included on their debut studio album. &quot;He Took Her to a Movie&quot;, &quot;Mu-Tron EP&quot;, &quot;The Way That I Found You&quot;, were all selected as NME &quot;Single of the Week&quot;.

Ladytron released the debut album &quot;604&quot; on 6 February 2001 on Emperor Norton (US), on 26 March 2001 on Labels (Germany) and on 2 April 2001 on Invicta Hi-Fi (UK). It was re-released on 20 July 2004 on Emperor Norton (US) and on 14 January 2011 (Germany), 18 January 2011 (US), 24 January 2011 (UK) on Nettwerk. &quot;604&quot; has been written mostly by Daniel Hunt and co-produced by him and Lance Thomas (who also engineered and mixed the album).

The band wore uniforms inspired by the science fiction movie &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; until the end of 2003. Daniel Hunt said in an interview for Jound from 2001: &quot;I&#x27;m really into &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, so that&#x27;s kind of an influence on the title of the album and the uniforms we&#x27;ve got and stuff. But the design – me and Reuben just love that film&quot;. Also in an interview for Chaos Control magazine from 2002 Hunt explained the &quot;604&quot; album title: &quot;It&#x27;s the area code for British Columbia... we&#x27;re glad we&#x27;ve attached this strange importance to that number, it crops up everywhere now. We noticed when we stayed in Hamburg in Germany (in a hotel called &quot;Commodore&quot; – pure coincidence), that the number to phone reception from your room was &#x27;604&#x27;. Moments afterwards the building had caught fire and we were lucky to escape with our lives. I&#x27;m not joking&quot;.

Ladytron performed on 4 August 2001 at Festival Internacional de Benicàssim in Spain, on 10 August 2001 at La Route du Rock in France, and on 26 August 2001 at Reading Festival in the UK. On 5 December 2001, they performed four songs for Radio 1&#x27;s John Peel Show.

On 1 October 2001, the compilation album &quot;&quot; was released on Carrot Top Records and it included The Human League&#x27; song &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; covered by Ladytron.

===&quot;Light and Magic&quot; (2002–2003)===

Their second album &quot;Light &amp; Magic&quot; was released on 17 September 2002 at Emperor Norton Records (US) and Telstar (UK). The album was also released on 7 April 2003 at Warner Music (Germany) and on 21 June 2003 at Victor Entertainment (Japan). It was re-released on 20 July 2004 on Emperor Norton (US) and on 14 January 2011 (Germany)/18 January 2011 (US)/24 January 2011 (UK) on Nettwerk.

&quot;Light &amp; Magic&quot; featured a darker sound than their previous album. It was written and produced in Los Angeles by the band and co-produced by Mickey Petralia. The album included the underground hits &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; and &quot;Evil&quot;. They also issued in 2003 a limited 7&quot; single, &quot;Cracked LCD / USA vs. White Noise&quot;.

They toured over a year to support the album. On 4 December 2002, Ladytron returned to John Peel Show and performed live 11 songs from their first 2 albums.

In 2002, Ladytron rescored the 1982 Tron film for a live event in London.

On 7 October 2003, they issued the mix compilation &quot;Softcore Jukebox&quot; on Emperor Norton. Besides the songs of other artists, the compilation also includes two of their own songs, the single remix of &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; renamed &quot;Blue Jeans 2.0&quot; and a cover of Tweet&#x27;s &quot;Oops (Oh My)&quot;.

===&quot;Witching Hour&quot; (2004–2007)===

Ladytron began working on demos for their next album immediately after concluding Light &amp; Magic tour with a homecoming gig in Liverpool in September 2003, where they were supported by Franz Ferdinand. Within a few months, they had mapped out the entire record and by the time they were ready to start recording in April 2004, their UK label Telstar Records had gone into administration. Their US label, Emperor Norton, also had problems: the company was purchased by Rykodisc in 2004 and was then shut down later that year, with Rykodisc inheriting its back-catalogue. The band announced on 7 December 2004 that they signed to Island Records.

In 2004, Ladytron were booked to play a series of shows in China as part of an exhibition tour set up by the British Council. They played on 24 and 25 September 2004 in Shenzhen, 28 September 2004 in Chongqing, 6 October 2004 and 7 October 2004 (DJ set) in Shanghai.

Ladytron released their critically acclaimed third studio album &quot;Witching Hour&quot; on 3 October 2005 on Island (UK) and later in other territories. Island Records also released a limited edition of this album in the form of a 2 disc set: a CD with the album and a DVD of video from the tour of China (&quot;Once Upon a Time in the East: Ladytron in China&quot;) plus 3 music videos (&quot;Destroy Everything You Touch&quot;, &quot;Sugar&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;). &quot;Witching Hour&quot; was re-released on 5 April 2007 on Major (Germany), on 5 November 2007 on So Sweet (UK), and on 18 January 2011 (US)/24 January 2011 (UK) on Nettwerk.

The album was recorded in 2004 at Elevator Studios in Liverpool and it was produced by Ladytron and Jim Abbiss. It featured Pop Levi on bass, live drums by Keith York and electric guitars mixed with their trademark sound. Pitchfork described it as a &quot;quantum leap record&quot;. The songs &quot;Sugar&quot;, &quot;Destroy Everything You Touch&quot;, &quot;International Dateline&quot;, &quot;Weekend&quot;, and &quot;Soft Power&quot; were issued as singles. &quot;Destroy Everything You Touch&quot; () became the band&#x27;s best known song.

In 2006 saw the light &quot;Extended Play&quot;, a two-disc EP CD/DVD compilation that featured exclusive unreleased remixes and B-sides, as well as a DVD with the same content as the one from &quot;Witching Hour&quot; limited edition. Also in 2006 Ladytron recorded and released the live EP &quot;The Harmonium Sessions&quot; with 4 songs from their third album.

Without any real label support, Ladytron toured exhaustively over the next two years, on the strength of their cult following. They played in North America, Europe, and South America. In early 2007, they also opened for the European shows of Nine Inch Nails, at the invitation of Trent Reznor.

===&quot;Velocifero&quot; (2007–2009)===

Ladytron were dropped by Island Records and signed to Nettwerk in late 2007.

Between 2007 and 2008, the band recorded the follow-up to &quot;Witching Hour&quot; at Studio de la Grande Armée in Paris with help from Alessandro Cortini (Modwheelmood, Nine Inch Nails, SONOIO) and Vicarious Bliss (Justice, DJ Mehdi). On 2 June 2008, Ladytron released their fourth album &quot;Velocifero&quot; on Nettwerk. The band stated that &quot;velocifero&quot; literally means &quot;bringer of speed&quot; and is also the name of a classic retro styled scooter. The album spawned three singles: &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

In mid 2008, the group composed three exclusive tracks performed in Simlish for The Sims 3 game soundtrack: &quot;Rockfalls &amp; Estuaries&quot;, &quot;She Stepped Out of the Car&quot; and &quot;Young Etruscians&quot;. Ladytron sang a song titled &quot;Use Your Mind&quot; on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Yo Gabba Gabba!.

On 6 April 2009, Nettwerk issued the remix compilation &quot;Velocifero (Remixed &amp; Rare)&quot;.

In 2009, Ladytron toured North America with The Faint, and performed two special shows with Brian Eno at the Sydney Opera House. In the same year they announced that they would be the opening act for Depeche Mode on a few concerts in Eastern Europe, but these concerts were cancelled due to Dave Gahan&#x27;s illness.

Also in 2009 Ladytron self-released their first live album &quot;Live at London Astoria 16.07.08&quot;, and co-wrote and produced a few songs for Christina Aguilera. The songs &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; and &quot;Little Dreamer&quot; were released a bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of her 2010 album &quot;Bionic&quot;, and &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; was later named as one of the &quot;Best Deep Cuts by 21st Century Pop Stars&quot; by the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

===&quot;Best of 00–10&quot; and &quot;Gravity the Seducer&quot; (2010–2011)===

The soundtrack of the video game &quot;FIFA 11&quot; included a new Ladytron song, &quot;Ace of Hz&quot;, which was also released as digital single on 30 November 2010. On 11 January 2011, the band issued the music download &quot;Ace of Hz EP&quot;, which contained the album mix as well as five remixes.

On 28 March 2011, it was released the compilation &quot;Best of 00–10&quot; featuring 17 tracks on standard edition and 33 tracks on deluxe edition plus an 80-page booklet. Both editions included two extra tracks, &quot;Ace of Hz&quot; and a cover version of Death in June&#x27;s &quot;Little Black Angel&quot;. Also in 2011, Nettwerk reissued all their previous albums, the remix compilation &quot;Best of Remixes&quot; and the iTunes video compilation &quot;Best of 00–10 Videos&quot; which included music videos for the singles &quot;Playgirl&quot;, &quot;Blue Jeans&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Sugar&quot;, &quot;Destroy Everything You Touch&quot;, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Ace of Hz&quot;. On 20 December 2011, Nettwerk issued the remix compilations &quot;604 (Remixed &amp; Rare)&quot;, &quot;Light &amp; Magic (Remixed &amp; Rare)&quot; and &quot;Witching Hour (Remixed &amp; Rare)&quot;.

During April 2011 and July 2011, Ladytron performed live in Austria, China, Russia, Finland, Sweden, Poland, UK, Ireland, Hungary and Spain.

Their fifth studio album, &quot;Gravity the Seducer&quot;, was released in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2011 and in the United States on 13 September 2011. The album was recorded in Kent&#x27;s countryside and it was produced by Ladytron and Barny Barnicott (Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, Editors). Daniel Hunt said that &quot;&quot;Gravity the Seducer&quot; is more of a jump than the last album was, more ethereal and melodic, a touch more abstract in places than we&#x27;ve gone before, baroque &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

&quot;Ace of Hz&quot;, which appears on the album, was previously released as a single from the band&#x27;s greatest hits compilation &quot;Best of 00–10&quot;. The first single from &quot;Gravity the Seducer&quot;, &quot;White Elephant&quot;, was issued on 17 May 2011 and its accompanying video was posted on YouTube on 26 July 2011. The band released two more singles, &quot;Ambulances&quot; on 16 June 2011 and &quot;Mirage&quot; on 8 August 2011. The music video for &quot;Mirage&quot; was posted on YouTube on 11 November 2011.

During September 2011 and December 2011, the band toured in United States, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore. For the concerts in North America, Ladytron were supported by SONOIO, VHS or Beta and Geographer.

===Self-titled album and &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot; (2016–present)===

On 18 July 2016, the band posted on their official website: &quot;After a five year hiatus following the release of their fifth album &quot;Gravity the Seducer&quot;, another chapter in Ladytron&#x27;s story is about to begin.&quot; On 26 November 2016, Ladytron posted on Instagram an image with a SSL recording console, implying that the recording of their sixth album started. On 28 February 2018, Ladytron started a PledgeMusic campaign to finish recording and releasing their new album. On the same day they released the first single &quot;The Animals&quot;. On 16 August the band premiered the single &quot;The Island&quot;. The track was accompanied by a disturbing short film directed by Bryan M. Ferguson.

On 10 October the band announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Ladytron&quot; and released on 15 February 2019 through their own Ladytron Music imprint via !K7. PledgeMusic suspended operations in February 2019, after repeated cases of failing to pay artists. The band subsequently issued updates stating that while much of the merchandise had never been made, they had been able to buy the vinyl and CDs from PledgeMusic&#x27;s administrators and were in the process of sending them out to subscribers who were willing to pay for the postage.

On 16 September 2019 Ladytron premiered the music video for &quot;Deadzone&quot;. The video was directed by frequent collaborator Bryan M. Ferguson.

==Music style==
Ladytron have described their sound as &quot;electronic pop&quot;, with music journalists similarly describing their sound as electropop. They focused on a balance between pop structures and experimental sounds. Their sound has also been described as synth-pop, electronic rock, post-punk revival, new wave, shoegaze, witch house, and art pop. While some writers have labeled Ladytron as an electroclash act, others have claimed that they are not entirely electroclash and Ladytron members have also rejected the term, with Daniel Hunt and Helen Marnie commenting:

Reuben Wu said about the process of making a new Ladytron album:

<text>In demonology, Beleth, also spelled Bilet, Bileth, Byleth, or Bilith, is a king of Hell who has eighty-five legions of demons under his command. He rides a pale horse, and a variety of music is heard before him, according to most authors on demonology and the most known grimoires.
According to &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, Noah&#x27;s son Ham was the first in invoking him after the flood, and wrote a book on mathematics with his help.

When appearing, he looks fierce in order to frighten the conjurer or to see if they are courageous. The conjurer must be brave, and hazel wand in hand, must draw a triangle by striking towards the south, east, and upwards, then commanding Beleth into it by means of some conjurations.

The &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; states that to summon Beleth, the person should hold a silver ring on the middle finger of the left hand against their face, to pay respect to Beleth&#x27;s rank as king.

<doc id="255644" wikidata="Q7846445" url="?curid=255644" title="Trouble at the Henhouse">
<text>Trouble at the Henhouse is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band the Tragically Hip, released in 1996. It was their first album to be released simultaneously in Canada and the United States.

==Commercial and critical performance==
&quot;Trouble at the Henhouse&quot; debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and stayed there for four straight weeks. By March 1997, it had sold 650,000 units in Canada and has since been certified 5× platinum. The album peaked at No. 134 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and at No. 80 in the Netherlands.

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; deemed &quot;Trouble at the Henhouse&quot; &quot;reliably melodic&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;a surprisingly large number of these songs are more atmospheric than aggressive.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;too much of &quot;Henhouse&quot; finds the Hip wallowing in meandering psychedelica, and too many of the slower songs (&#x27;Sherpa&#x27;, &#x27;Flamenco&#x27;, &#x27;Put It Off&#x27;) sound too much alike.&quot; The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; praised Gord Downie&#x27;s ability to pen lyrics that &quot;found beauty in the tiny wonders of life while exploring big questions of existence.&quot;

The record won Album of the Year and North Star Rock Album of the Year at the 1997 Juno Awards.

<doc id="255645" wikidata="Q182455" url="?curid=255645" title="Wilt Chamberlain">
<text>Wilton Norman Chamberlain ( ; August21, 1936 – October12, 1999) was an American professional basketball player. Standing tall, he played center in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 14 seasons. He was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, and was elected to the NBA&#x27;s 35th, 50th, and 75th anniversary teams.

According to former teammate Billy Cunningham, &quot;The NBA Guide reads like Wilt&#x27;s personal diary.&quot; Chamberlain holds 72 NBA records, including several regular season records in scoring, rebounding, and durability; blocks were not counted during his career. He is best remembered as the only player to score 100 points in a single game. He also once gathered 55 rebounds, and never fouled out. Chamberlain is the only player to average 30 points and 20 rebounds per game in a season, a feat he accomplished seven times. He once averaged 50 points per game, as well as 48 minutes per game, in a season. Chamberlain ultimately won two NBA championships, four regular-season Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, the Rookie of the Year, one Finals MVP, and one All-Star Game MVP; he was selected to thirteen All-Star Games and ten All-NBA Teams (seven First and three Second teams). He won seven scoring, eleven rebounding, nine durability, and nine field goal percentage titles; he is the only center to lead the league in total assists.

While in college, Chamberlain played for the Kansas Jayhawks, and lost the national championship game to the North Carolina Tar Heels in triple overtime his sophomore year. He also played for the Harlem Globetrotters before joining the NBA, where he played for the Philadelphia / San Francisco Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Lakers. Chamberlain had an on-court rivalry with Boston Celtics&#x27; center Bill Russell, suffering a long string of losses before breaking through and winning the 1967 NBA Finals as a member of the 76ers. Chamberlain won his second championship as a member of the 1972 Lakers, a team which set a record with a 33-game winning streak. Following his professional basketball career, Chamberlain played volleyball in the short-lived International Volleyball Association (IVA). He served one term as league president and is enshrined in the IVA Hall of Fame.

Sportswriters knew Chamberlain by several nicknames during his playing career, calling attention to his height since his high school days. He disliked the ones that negatively portrayed his height, such as &quot;Wilt the Stilt&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot;, preferring &quot;the Big Dipper&quot;, inspired by his friends who saw him dip his head as he walked through doorways. The name was retained in one of Chamberlain&#x27;s signature moves, the &quot;dipper dunk&quot;. He was one of the first players to make prominent use of shots like the fade away jump shot, and the finger roll. His success near the basket led to the widening of the lane, offensive goaltending rules, and the banning of inbound passes over the backboard. Chamberlain, always a poor free throw shooter, had the ability to dunk from the foul line, which led to the ruling that a free-throw shooter must keep his feet behind the line.

==Early years==
Wilton Norman Chamberlain was born on August21, 1936, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the sixth of nine children to southerners Olivia Ruth (née Johnson), a domestic worker, and William Chamberlain, a welder and handyman. The family lived in a middle-class neighborhood in the Haddington section of West Philadelphia. Chamberlain was raised as a Baptist.

Chamberlain&#x27;s first competitive sport was track. As a fourth grader, he ran the 300-yard shuttle in the 1946 Penn Relays among older teammates. Tall from an early age, he stood by 10 years old. He nearly died of pneumonia in his early years and missed a whole year of school as a result. During early childhood, he was not interested in basketball, which he regarded as &quot;a game for sissies&quot;. According to Chamberlain, however, &quot;basketball was king in Philadelphia&quot;, so he eventually turned to the sport in seventh grade, while attending Shoemaker Junior High School.

==High school career==
=== Overbrook High School (1953–1955)===
Chamberlain stood when he entered Philadelphia&#x27;s Overbrook High School. As an avid track and field athlete, he high jumped 6 feet, 6 inches, ran the 440 yards in 49.0 seconds and the 880 yards in 1:58.3, put the shot 53 feet, 4 inches, and long jumped 22 feet.

Chamberlain was the star player for the Overbrook Hilltoppers basketball team, wearing jersey number five. Chamberlain had a natural advantage against his peers; he became renowned for his scoring talent, physical strength, and shot-blocking abilities. According to ESPN journalist Hal Bock, Chamberlain was &quot;scary, flat-out frightening ... before he came along, very few players at the center position possessed his level of athleticism, stature, and stamina. Chamberlain changed the game in fundamental ways no other player did.&quot; In this period of his life, his three lifelong nicknames &quot;Wilt the Stilt&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot;, and &quot;The Big Dipper&quot;—his favorite—were coined.

Chamberlain led the team to two city championships over three seasons, with Overbrook logging a 56–3 win-loss record. He broke Hall of Fame guard Tom Gola&#x27;s Philadelphia-high-school scoring record (2,222 points) and graduated with 2,252 points, averaging 37.4 points per game.

==== 1953: city runner-up ====
Chamberlain averaged 31 points per game during his 1953 high-school season and led his team to a 71–62 win over the Northeast High School team of Hall of Fame guard Guy Rodgers. Chamberlain scored 34 points as Overbrook won the Philadelphia Public League title and gained a spot in the city championship game against West Catholic High School, the winner of the rival Catholic league. In that game, West Catholic quadruple-teamed Chamberlain throughout the game, and despite his 29 points, the Hilltoppers lost 54–42.

==== 1954: city champions ====
In his second season, Chamberlain led Overbrook to a 19–0 season. He scored a high-school record 71 points against Roxborough. The Hilltoppers comfortably won the Public League title after again beating Northeast High, as Chamberlain scored 40 points. Overbrook then won the city title by defeating South Catholic 74–50. Chamberlain scored 32 points and Overbrook finished the season undefeated.

During his summer vacations, Chamberlain worked as a bellhop at Kutsher&#x27;s Hotel. Owners Milton and Helen Kutsher maintained a lifelong friendship with Chamberlain. Red Auerbach, the coach of the NBA&#x27;s Boston Celtics, was also athletic director of the summer basketball league at Kutscher&#x27;s; Auerbach spotted Chamberlain playing there and had him play one-on-one against University of Kansas (KU) standout and national champion B. H. Born, elected NCAA Most Outstanding Player in 1953. Chamberlain won 25–10; Born was so dejected he gave up a promising NBA career and became a tractor engineer; according to Born, &quot;If there were high school kids that good, I figured I wasn&#x27;t going to make it to the pros&quot;. Auerbach wanted Chamberlain to go to a New England university so the Celtics could draft him as a territorial pick but Chamberlain did not respond.

==== 1955: city champions ====
In Chamberlain&#x27;s third and final Overbrook season, he continued his high scoring, logging 74, 78, and 90 points in three consecutive games. The Hilltoppers suffered just one loss, to Farrell High 59–58. Overbrook won the Public League a third time, beating West Philadelphia 78–60; in the city championship game, they again played West Catholic. Chamberlain scored 35 points and led Overbrook to an 83–42 victory. He was retroactively honored as Mr. Basketball USA for 1955, the earliest year for which such a selection was made.

=== Christian Street YMCA ===
In 1953, while still a sophomore in high school, Chamberlain won his first championship. He led Christian Street YMCA to the title in the national YMCA tournament in High Point, North Carolina, beating the local favorite and defending champion High Point team 85–79. Chamberlain was the youngest member of the team.

=== Pittsburgh Raiders and Quakertown Fays ===
On December 21, 1952, Chamberlain played for the Pittsburgh Raiders under the pseudonym of George Marcus in a professional game against the Cumberland Old Germans. At the ages of 16 and 17, Chamberlain, using the same pseudonym, played several games for the semi-professional team Quakertown Fays of Quakertown, Pennsylvania, during the 1954–55 season. The games were reported in local publications, but Chamberlain tried to keep them secret from the Amateur Athletic Union as they jeopardised his eligibility to play amateur basketball.

==College career==

After his last Overbrook season, more than 200 universities tried to recruit Chamberlain. Among others, UCLA offered Chamberlain the opportunity to become a movie star, the University of Pennsylvania wanted to buy him diamonds, and Cecil Mosenson, Chamberlain&#x27;s coach at Overbrook, was offered a coaching position if he could persuade Chamberlain to accept an offer.

Chamberlain wished to experience life away from home, so he eliminated colleges from the East Coast; he also ruled out the South because of racial segregation and felt West Coast basketball was of a lower quality than in other regions. This left the Midwest as Chamberlain&#x27;s probable choice. After visiting KU and talking with the school&#x27;s coach, Phog Allen, Chamberlain announced he was going to play college basketball at Kansas.

=== University of Kansas (1956–1958) ===
In 1955, Chamberlain entered the University of Kansas (KU); he was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and was president of his pledge class. As he had at Overbrook, Chamberlain displayed his diverse athletic talent at KU. He ran the 100-yard dash in 10.9 seconds, shot-putted , triple jumped more than , and won the high jump in the Big Eight Conference track-and-field championships in three consecutive years. Chamberlain allegedly dunked on an experimental 12-foot basket set up by Phog Allen. 
Chamberlain&#x27;s freshman team debut was highly anticipated; the freshman team played against the varsity, who were favored to win their conference that year. Chamberlain dominated his older college teammates by scoring 42 points (16–35 from the field, 10–12 on free throws), grabbing 29 rebounds, and registering 4 blocks.

Chamberlain was the catalyst for several 1956 NCAA basketball rule changes, including the requirement for a shooter to keep both feet behind the line during a free-throw attempt. He had a vertical leap, and was capable of converting foul shots by dunking without a running start, beginning his movement just steps behind the top of the key. An inbounds pass over the backboard was banned because of Chamberlain. Offensive goaltending, also called basket interference, was introduced as a rule in 1956 after Bill Russell had exploited it at San Francisco and Chamberlain was soon to enter college play.

Chamberlain&#x27;s prospects of playing under coach Allen ended when Allen turned 70 and retired shortly after in accordance with KU regulations. According to Cherry, it is doubtful Chamberlain would have chosen KU if he had known Allen was going to retire. Chamberlain had a poor relationship with Allen&#x27;s successor, Dick Harp. For many years following Chamberlain&#x27;s departure from KU, critics said he wanted to leave the Midwest or was embarrassed by not being able to win a championship. In 1998, Chamberlain returned to Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas, to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his 13 jersey. He said, &quot;There&#x27;s been a lot of conversation ... that I have some dislike for the University of Kansas. That is totally ridiculous.&quot;

==== Sophomore season (1957): national runner-up to North Carolina ====
On December3, 1956, Chamberlain made his varsity basketball debut as a center for the Kansas Jayhawks. In his first game, he scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time Kansas records in an 87–69 win against the Northwestern Wildcats, a team with Chamberlain&#x27;s future NBA teammate Joe Ruklick playing center. Chamberlain led a talented squad of starters, including Maurice King, Gene Elstun, John Parker, and Ron Lonesky; the Jayhawks went 13–1 until they lost a game 56–54 against the Oklahoma State Cowboys, who held the ball for the last three-and-a -half minutes with no intention of scoring a basket, which was still possible in the days before the shot clock, introduced by the NCAA in 1984.

Kansas finished the regular season 21–2 and were Big Seven conference champions. Chamberlain was named first-team All-American. Teammate Monte Johnson stated Chamberlain had &quot;unbelievable endurance and speed ... and was never tired. When he dunked, he was so fast that a lot of players got their fingers jammed [between Chamberlain&#x27;s hand and the rim].&quot; By this time, several aspects of Chamberlain&#x27;s game, such as his finger roll, his fadeaway jump shot—which he could also make as a bank shot—his passing, and his shot-blocking, were already developed.

The Jayhawks were one of twenty-three teams selected to play in the 1957 NCAA basketball tournament. The Midwest Regional was held in Dallas, Texas, which at the time was segregated. In the first game, the Jayhawks played the all-white SMU Mustangs, and KU&#x27;s John Parker later said: &quot;The crowd was brutal. We were spat on, pelted with debris, and subjected to the vilest racial epithets possible.&quot; KU won 73–65 in overtime, and police had to escort the Jayhawks out. The next game against Oklahoma City was equally unpleasant, with KU winning 81–61.

In the semifinals, the Jayhawks defeated the two-time defending national champion San Francisco Dons 80–56; Chamberlain scored 32 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, and had (at least) seven blocked shots. Chamberlain&#x27;s performance led Kansas to an insurmountable lead, and he rested on the bench for the final three-and-three-quarter minutes of the game.

In the NCAA finals, the second-ranked Kansas Jayhawks played the top-ranked, undefeated North Carolina Tar Heels, led by All-American and National Player of the Year Lennie Rosenbluth. Tar Heels coach Frank McGuire used several unorthodox tactics to thwart Chamberlain. For the tip-off, he sent his shortest player Tommy Kearns to upset Chamberlain; and the Tar Heels spent the rest of the night triple-teaming him, one defender in front, one behind, and a third arriving as soon as he got the ball. With the Tar Heels&#x27; fixation on Chamberlain, the Jayhawks shot only 27% from the field in contrast with 64% for the Tar Heels, and trailed 22–29 at halftime. With 10 minutes to go, North Carolina led 40–37 and stalled the game as they passed the ball around with no intention of scoring a basket. After several Tar Heel turnovers, the game was tied at 46 at the end of regulation.

Each team scored two points in the first overtime; Kansas froze the ball in return during the second overtime, keeping the game tied at 48. In the third overtime, the Tar Heels scored two consecutive baskets but Chamberlain executed a three-point play, leaving KU trailing 52–51. After King scored a basket, Kansas was ahead by one point. With 10 seconds remaining, Tar Heels&#x27; center Joe Quigg pump faked then drove to the basket. Chamberlain blocked Quigg&#x27;s shot but was also called for the foul. Quigg made his two foul shots to put the Tar Heels up 54–53. For the final play, Harp called for Ron Loneski to pass the ball into Chamberlain in the low post but Quigg tipped the pass and Kearns recovered it, and the Tar Heels won the game.

Despite the loss, Chamberlain, who scored 23 points and 14 rebounds, was elected the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. Chamberlain considered it the most painful loss of his life, the first time his team lost despite his impressive individual statistics. It is considered by sportswriters one of the sport&#x27;s greatest games: North Carolina&#x27;s first of six NCAA national titles, the first national final to go into overtime and still the only one to go into triple overtime.

==== Junior season (1958) ====
In Chamberlain&#x27;s junior season of 1957–58, the Jayhawks&#x27; matches were increasingly frustrating for him. Knowing how good he was, opponents resorted to freeze-ball tactics and routinely used three or more players to guard him. Teammate Bob Billings commented, &quot;It was not fun basketball ... we were just out chasing people throwing the basketball back and forth&quot;. Chamberlain averaged 30.1 points for the season and led the Jayhawks to an 18–5 record — three of the losses coming while he was out with a urinary infection. The Jayhawks&#x27; season ended because KU came in second in the league and only conference winners were invited to the NCAA tournament. Chamberlain was again named an All-American, along with future NBA Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor of Seattle University, Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati, and Guy Rodgers, who was now playing for Temple University.

Having lost enjoyment in NCAA basketball and wanting to earn money, Chamberlain left college and sold a story titled &quot;Why I Am Leaving College&quot; to &quot;Look magazine&quot; for $10,000, a large sum when NBA players earned $9,000 in a season. In two seasons at KU, he averaged 29.9 points and 18.3 rebounds per game while totaling 1,433 points and 877 rebounds. Despite only playing in 48 games and last playing in 1958, Chamberlain&#x27;s 877 rebounds is still 8th all-time in Kansas history. By the time Chamberlain was 21 and not yet a professional, he had been featured in &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot;.

==Professional career==
===Harlem Globetrotters (1958–1959)===
After his frustrating junior year, Chamberlain wanted to become a professional player. At that time, the NBA did not accept players until after their college graduating class had been completed; Chamberlain decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for $50,000. The team enjoyed a sold-out tour of the Soviet Union in 1959; they were greeted by General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev prior to the start of a game at Moscow&#x27;s Lenin Central Stadium. One Globetrotter skit involved Captain Meadowlark Lemon collapsing to the ground; instead of helping him up, Chamberlain threw him several feet into the air and caught him like a doll. Lemon, who at that time weighed , later said Chamberlain was &quot;the strongest athlete who ever lived&quot;.

In later years, Chamberlain frequently joined the Globetrotters in the off-season and fondly recalled his time there because he was no longer jeered at or asked to break records, but was one of several artists who loved to entertain audiences. On March9, 2000, the Globetrotters retired his No. 13 jersey.

===Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors (1959–1965)===
Chamberlain made his NBA debut on October24, 1959, starting for the Philadelphia Warriors. He was listed as tall and . He became the NBA&#x27;s highest-paid player when he signed for $30,000 in his rookie contract. In comparison, the previous top earner was Bob Cousy of the Celtics with $25,000, the same sum Eddie Gottlieb used to buy the Warriors franchise in 1952.

====1959–60 NBA season: MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Rookie of the Year====
In the 1959–60 NBA season, Chamberlain joined a Philadelphia Warriors squad that was coached by Neil Johnston. All five starters were native Philadelphians: Chamberlain, Tom Gola, Guy Rodgers, Hall-of-Fame forward Paul Arizin, and Ernie Beck. In his first NBA game, played against the New York Knicks, Chamberlain scored 43 points and grabbed 28 rebounds. In his third game, Chamberlain recorded 41 points and a then-career-high 40 rebounds in a 124–113 win over the visiting Syracuse Nationals. In his fourth game, Philadelphia played the reigning champion Boston Celtics—who were coached by Auerbach, whose offer Chamberlain had rejected several years before—and Bill Russell, who was lauded as one of the best defensive pivots in the game.

In the first of many match-ups, Chamberlain outscored Russell with 30 points against Russell&#x27;s 28 points, but Boston won the game and the Chamberlain–Russell rivalry would grow to become one of the NBA&#x27;s greatest of all time. On November10, 1959, Chamberlain posted 39 points and a new career-high 43 rebounds in a 126–125 win over the visiting Knicks. He recorded a rock n&#x27; roll record in January 1960, singing &quot;That&#x27;s Easy to Say&quot; and &quot;By the River&quot;.

Chamberlain was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team, winning the All-Star Game and the All-Star Game MVP award with a 23-point, 25-rebound performance. On January25, 1960, Chamberlain had 50 points and 40 rebounds in an NBA game, a rare occurrence. During the game against the Detroit Pistons, Chamberlain recorded 58 points, 42 rebounds, and 4 assists in a winning effort. His 58 points were a then-career-high, and he later tied that on February21, when he recorded 58 points and 24 rebounds in a 131–121 win over the visiting Knicks.

In his first NBA season, Chamberlain averaged 37.6 points, 27.0 rebounds and 46.4 minutes played, breaking the previous regular-season records. To this day no other player has ever averaged more rebounds or minutes played in a season, and only one player, Elgin Baylor, has ever averaged more points in a season than Chamberlain did in his rookie year. He needed only 56 games to score 2,102 points, breaking the all-time regular-season scoring record of Bob Pettit, who needed 72 games to score 2,101 points. Chamberlain broke eight NBA records, and he was named both Rookie of the Year and MVP that season.

The Warriors entered the 1960 NBA playoffs and beat the Syracuse Nationals, setting up a game against the Eastern Division-champion Celtics. According to Cherry, Celtics coach Auerbach ordered his forward Tom Heinsohn to commit personal fouls on Chamberlain; whenever the Warriors took foul shots, Heinsohn grabbed and shoved Chamberlain to prevent him from running back quickly. Auerbach&#x27;s intention was for the Celtics to throw the ball quickly enough to prevent Chamberlain, a prolific shot-blocker, from returning to his own basket in time, and Boston could score an easy fastbreak basket. The teams split the first two games but Chamberlain became annoyed with Heinsohn and punched him during Game 3. In the scuffle, Chamberlain injured his hand, and Philadelphia lost the next two games. In Game 5, with his hand healthy, Chamberlain recorded 50 points and 35 rebounds in a 128–107 win over the Celtics, extending the series to a Game 6. In Game 6, Heinsohn scored the decisive basket with a last-second tip-in, and the Warriors lost the series 4–2.

Chamberlain then shocked Warriors&#x27; fans by saying he was thinking of retiring. He was tired of being double-teamed or triple-teamed, and of teams executing hard personal fouls on him. He also expressed a constant fear that he might lose his temper one day. Celtics forward Heinsohn said, &quot;Half the fouls against him were hard fouls ... he took the most brutal pounding of any player ever&quot;. Gottlieb coaxed Chamberlain back into the NBA with a salary increase to $65,000.

====1960–61 NBA season: scoring, rebounding, durability, and field goal titles====
Chamberlain&#x27;s 1960–61 NBA season started with a 42-point and 31-rebound performance in a 133–123 road win against the Syracuse Nationals. On November 24, 1960, Chamberlain grabbed an NBA-record 55 rebounds, along with 34 points and 4 assists, in a 132–129 home loss against the Russell-led Boston Celtics. On November29, Chamberlain recorded 44 points, 38 rebounds, and a then-career-high 7 assists in a 122–121 road win over the Los Angeles Lakers.

Chamberlain exceeded his rookie-season statistics, averaging 38.4 points and 27.2 rebounds per game. He became the first player to score more than 3,000 points, and the first and still the only player to exceed 2,000 rebounds in a single season, grabbing 2,149 boards. Chamberlain won his first field-goal percentage title, scored almost 32% of his team&#x27;s points, and collected 30.4% of their rebounds. Chamberlain failed to convert his play into team success, this time bowing out against the Nationals in a three-game sweep. According to Cherry, Chamberlain was &quot;difficult&quot; and did not respect coach Johnston, who was unable to handle him. In retrospect, Gottlieb said, &quot;My mistake was not getting a strong-handed coach ... [Johnston] wasn&#x27;t ready for big time&quot;.

====1961–62 NBA season: 100-point game and 42-point All-Star Game record ====
In the 1961–62 NBA season, the Warriors were coached by Frank McGuire, who had masterminded Chamberlain&#x27;s triple-overtime loss in the NCAA championship against the Tar Heels. In that year, Chamberlain set several all-time records which have since never been threatened; he averaged 50.4 points and grabbed 25.7 rebounds per game.

Chamberlain&#x27;s 4,029 regular-season points made him the only player to score more than 4,000 points. Chamberlain posted 2,052 rebounds and played for an average of 48.53 minutes per game, playing 3,882 of his team&#x27;s 3,890 minutes. Because Chamberlain played in overtime games, he averaged more minutes per game than the regulation 48 and would have played every minute if he had not been ejected in one game after picking up a second technical foul with eight minutes left to play.

On March2, 1962, on a neutral court against the New York Knicks in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points. He shot 36 of 63 from the field and uncharacteristically made 28 of 32 free throws. Joe Ruklick got the assist for Chamberlain&#x27;s 100th point. The game was not recorded on video, and only a radio broadcast of the fourth quarter remains. One writer notes the lack of video of the 100-point game &quot;only added to its mystique&quot;. For years, former NBA Commissioner David Stern&#x27;s office phone would play announcer Bill Campbell&#x27;s call of the 100-point basket to callers on hold: &quot;He made it! He made it! He made it! A Dipper Dunk!&quot;

In addition to Chamberlain&#x27;s regular-season accomplishments, he scored 42 points in the All-Star Game. In the playoffs, the Warriors again played against the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals; both Cousy and Russell called this season the greatest Celtics team of all time. Each team won their home games so the series was split at three after six games. In a closely contested Game 7, Chamberlain tied the game at 107 with 16 seconds to go but Celtics&#x27; shooting guard Sam Jones hit a clutch shot with two seconds left to win the series for Boston. In later years, Chamberlain was criticized for averaging 50 points but not winning a title; McGuire said &quot;Wilt has been simply super-human&quot; and that the Warriors lacked a consistent second scorer, a playmaker, and a second big man to take pressure off Chamberlain.

====1962–63 NBA season: individual success, move to San Francisco, and playoff miss====
In the 1962–63 NBA season, Gottlieb sold the Warriors franchise for $850,000 to a group of businessmen led by Franklin Mieuli from San Francisco and the team relocated and were renamed the San Francisco Warriors under new coach Bob Feerick. This meant the Warriors team dispersed; Arizin chose to retire rather than move away from his family and his job at IBM in Philadelphia, coach McGuire resigned rather than move to the West Coast, and Gola was homesick and requesting a trade to the New York Knicks halfway through the season. With both secondary scorers gone, Chamberlain continued exceeding his own statistics, averaging 44.8 points and 24.3 rebounds per game that year. Despite his individual success, the Warriors lost 49 of their 80 games and missed the playoffs.

====1963–64 NBA season: first NBA Finals loss to the Celtics====
In the 1963–64 NBA season, Chamberlain got another new coach, former NBA player and ex-soldier Alex Hannum, and was joined by rookie center Nate Thurmond, who later entered the Hall of Fame. Hannum, who later entered the Hall of Fame as a coach, was a crafty psychologist who emphasized defense and passing, and was not afraid to stand up to the dominant Chamberlain, who would not communicate with coaches he did not like. Backed up by Thurmond, Chamberlain recorded 36.9 points and 22.3 rebounds per game, and the Warriors reached the NBA Finals. In that series, they again succumbed to Russell&#x27;s Boston Celtics, losing 4–1. According to Cherry, Chamberlain and Hannum deserved much credit because Hannum had taken the previous year&#x27;s 31–49 squad plus Thurmond, and became an NBA Finals contender.

In mid-1964, Chamberlain, a prominent participant at Rucker Park basketball court in New York City, made the acquaintance of Lew Alcindor, a tall, talented, 17-year-old who played there. Alcindor was soon allowed into Chamberlain&#x27;s inner circle and quickly idolized the ten-year-older Chamberlain. The pair later developed an intense rivalry and personal antipathy.

===Philadelphia 76ers (1965–1968)===

====1964–65 NBA season: trade to the 76ers, division finals loss to the Celtics====
In the 1964–65 NBA season, the NBA widened the lane from , especially because of centers like Chamberlain. The Warriors&#x27; season began poorly and they experienced financial trouble. At the 1965 All-Star Weekend, Chamberlain was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, the renamed former-rival and relocated Syracuse Nationals. Chamberlain did not like Sixers&#x27; coach Dolph Schayes, who he thought had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players. The Warriors received $150,000 and Paul Neumann, Connie Dierking, and Lee Shaffer—who opted to retire rather than report to the Warriors. When Chamberlain left the Warriors, owner Franklin Mieuli said: &quot;Chamberlain is not an easy man to love ... the fans in San Francisco never learned to love him. Wilt is easy to hate ... people came to see him lose.&quot;

After the trade, a reluctant Chamberlain found himself on a promising Sixers team that included veteran shooting guard and future Hall-of-Famer Hal Greer and talented role-players such as point guard Larry Costello, small forward Chet Walker, and centers Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Kerr and Lucious Jackson. The team also included All-Rookie forward Billy Cunningham in the new sixth man role. Cherry noted there was tension within the team because Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not willing to give up his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain occupied the center spot. As the season progressed; however, the three began to work together more closely.

Chamberlain posted 34.7 points and 22.9 rebounds per game overall for the season. Future Georgetown coach John Thompson, then a rookie for the Boston Celtics, elbowed Chamberlain in the face and broke his nose, causing him to wear a face mask in several games. After defeating the Cincinnati Royals—a team led by fellow All-American Oscar Robertson—in the playoffs, the Sixers played against Chamberlain&#x27;s rival Boston Celtics; the press called it an even match in all positions, even at center, where Russell was expected to give Chamberlain a tough battle. The teams split the first six games and the last game was held in the Celtics&#x27; Boston Garden because of their better season record. In that Game 7, Chamberlain scored 30 points and 32 rebounds while Russell logged 16 points, 27 rebounds, and eight assists.

In the final minute, Chamberlain hit two clutch free throws and slam dunked on Russell, reducing Boston&#x27;s lead to 110–109 with five seconds left. Russell&#x27;s inbounds pass hit a guy-wire supporting the backboard, giving the ball back to the Sixers. Coach Schayes called timeout and decided it would be unwise to pass the ball to Chamberlain, whom he feared the Celtics would intentionally foul. Red Kerr set a pick on Sam Jones to free Chet Walker. When Greer attempted to inbound the ball to Walker, John Havlicek stole the ball to preserve the Celtics&#x27; lead. For the fifth time in seven years, Russell&#x27;s team deprived Chamberlain of the title. According to Chamberlain, it was in this game people started calling him a loser. In an interview in the April 1965 issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Chamberlain criticized his fellow players, coaches, and NBA administrators. Chamberlain later said he could see in hindsight the interview was instrumental in damaging his public image.

====1965–66 NBA season: MVP and second division finals loss to the Celtics====
In the 1965–66 NBA season, Ike Richman, the Sixers&#x27; co-owner as well as Chamberlain&#x27;s confidant and lawyer, died of a heart attack while attending a road game in Boston. The Sixers posted a 55–25 regular-season record and Chamberlain won his second MVP award. In that season, Chamberlain again dominated his opposition by recording 33.5 points and 24.6 rebounds a game, leading the league in both categories. In one game, Chamberlain dislocated the shoulder of Baltimore Bullets player Gus Johnson by blocking his dunk attempt.

Off the court, Chamberlain&#x27;s commitment to the team was doubted because he was a late sleeper and lived in New York City, preferring to commute to Philadelphia rather than live there, and he was only available for training in the afternoon. Because Schayes did not want to risk angering his best player, he scheduled the daily workout at 4 pm. This angered the rest of the team, who preferred an early schedule that allowed them the afternoon off but Schayes dismissed their protests. Irv Kosloff, who owned the Sixers alone after Richman&#x27;s death, unsuccessfully pleaded with Chamberlain to move to Philadelphia during the season.

In the playoffs, the Sixers again played the Boston Celtics and for the first time had home-court advantage. Boston won the first two games on the road, winning 115–96 and 114–93; while Chamberlain played within his usual range, his fellow team members shot under 40%. This caused sports journalist Joe McGinnis to comment, &quot;The Celtics played like champions and the Sixers just played&quot;. In Game 3, Chamberlain scored 31 points and 27 rebounds for the road win. When coach Schayes planned to hold a joint team practice the next day, Chamberlain said he was too tired to attend and refused Schayes&#x27; plea to attend and shoot a few foul shots with the team. In Game 4, Boston won 114–108. Prior to Game 5, Chamberlain skipped practice and was non-accessible. Schayes defended Chamberlain as &quot;excused from practice&quot; but his teammates knew the truth and were less forgiving. In Game 5, Chamberlain scored 46 points and grabbed 34 rebounds, but the Celtics won the game 120–112 and the series. According to Cherry, Chamberlain was the only Sixers player who performed in the series but his unprofessional, egotistical behavior set a poor example for his teammates.

====1966–67 NBA season: back-to-back MVP and first NBA title====
Prior to the 1966–67 NBA season, Schayes was replaced by the more-assertive Alex Hannum. According to Cherry, in a locker room meeting, Hannum addressed several key issues he observed during the last season, several of them putting Chamberlain in an unfavorable light. Sixers forward Walker said on several occasions, players had to pull Chamberlain and Hannum apart to prevent a fistfight. Cunningham commented Hannum &quot;never backed down&quot; and &quot;showed who was the boss&quot;, winning Chamberlain&#x27;s respect. When emotions dissipated, Hannum told Chamberlain he was also trying to win a title but that to achieve this, Chamberlain had to &quot;act like a man&quot; both on and off the court. Hannum persuaded Chamberlain to change his style of play and wanted Chamberlain to concentrate more on defense than on trying to score. Kerr was traded to the Baltimore Bullets for point guard Wali Jones, and shooting guard Matt Guokas was selected in the first round of the 1966 NBA draft.

As a result of his style-of-play change, Chamberlain averaged a career-low 24.1 points and took only 14% of the team&#x27;s shots, but was extremely efficient with a record-breaking .683 field-goal accuracy. He also led the league in rebounds per game (24.2), was third in assists per game (7.8), and played strong defense. His efficiency that season was reflected by 35 consecutive made field goals over four games in February. For these achievements, Chamberlain earned his third MVP award. The Sixers had a then-record 68–13 season, including a record 46–4 start. The formerly egotistical Chamberlain began to praise his teammates, lauding hardworking Lucious Jackson as the &quot;ultimate power forward&quot;; calling Greer a deadly jump-shooter; and Jones an excellent defender and outside scorer. Off the court, Chamberlain invited the team to restaurants and paid the entire bill, knowing he earned ten times more than the others. Greer, who was considered a consummate professional and often clashed with Chamberlain because of his attitude, spoke positively of him, saying, &quot;You knew in a minute the Big Fella [Chamberlain] was ready to go ... and everybody would follow&quot;.

In the playoffs, the Sixers again played the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division Finals and held home-court advantage. In Game 1, the Sixers beat Boston 127–112, powered by Greer&#x27;s 39 points and Chamberlain&#x27;s unofficial quadruple double, with 24 points, 32 rebounds, 13 assists, and 12 unofficially counted blocks. In Game 2, the Sixers won 107–102 in overtime and player-coach Russell grudgingly praised Chamberlain for intimidating the Celtics into taking low-percentage shots from further outside. In Game 3, Chamberlain grabbed 41 rebounds and helped the Sixers win 115–104. The Celtics prevented a sweep by winning Game 4 with a 121–117 victory. Russell, who was coming close to the first real loss of his career, said, &quot;Right now, he [Chamberlain] is playing like me [to win]&quot;. In Game 5, the Sixers outscored the Celtics 140–116, ending Boston&#x27;s historic run of eight consecutive NBA titles. Chamberlain scored 29 points, 36 rebounds, and 13 assists, and was praised by the Celtics&#x27; Russell and K. C. Jones. Philadelphia fans chanted &quot;Boston is dead&quot;.

In the 1967 NBA Finals, the Sixers played against Chamberlain&#x27;s old team the San Francisco Warriors, who were led by future Hall-of-Famers: star forward Rick Barry and center Nate Thurmond. The Sixers won the first two games; Chamberlain and Greer took credit for defense and clutch shooting. The Warriors won game 3, the Sixers won game 4 with Chamberlain contributing an official 10 blocked shots, and the Warriors won game 5; so Philadelphia was up 3–2 prior to Game 6. In Game 6, the Warriors were trailing 123–122 with 15 seconds left. For the last play, Thurmond and Barry tried a pick and roll against Chamberlain and Walker, but the Sixers foiled it because Walker held up Thurmond&#x27;s ability to roll and Barry was defended by Chamberlain, making it impossible to shoot. By the time Barry made his move, Walker recovered back to Barry, who was stuck in the air and botched the shot. Jackson forced a jump ball on the rebound and the Sixers won the championship. Chamberlain, who contributed with 17.7 points and 28.7 rebounds per game against Thurmond, snaring at least 23 rebounds in the six games, said, &quot;It is wonderful to be a part of the greatest team in basketball ... being a champion is like having a big round glow inside of you&quot;. This Sixers team has been ranked as one of the best in NBA history.

====1967–68 NBA season: third straight MVP and assist champion====
In the 1967–68 NBA season, the relationship between Chamberlain and Sixers&#x27; owner Kosloff continued to deteriorate. In 1965, Chamberlain said he and Richman had worked out a deal that would give Chamberlain 25% of the franchise once he ended his career. Although there is no written proof of this agreement, Schayes and Sixers&#x27; lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was correct. Kosloff declined the request, angering Chamberlain, who was willing to move to the rival American Basketball Association (ABA) once his contract ended in 1967. Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce and later signed a one-year, $250,000 contract.

On the court, Chamberlain continued his focus on team play, and registered 24.3 points and 23.8 rebounds a game for the season. On March18, 1968, in a 158–128 victory against the Los Angeles Lakers, Chamberlain had a quintuple-double with 53 points, 32 rebounds, 14 assists, 24 blocks, and 11 steals. Chamberlain also recorded then the most points in a triple-double. The 76ers had the best record in the league for the third consecutive season, and Chamberlain became the only center in NBA history to finish the season as the leader in total assists; his 702 beating runner-up point guard and future Hall-of-Famer Lenny Wilkens&#x27; total by 23. Chamberlain likened his assist title to baseball home-run hitter Babe Ruth leading the league in sacrifice bunts, and felt he dispelled the myth he was incapable or unwilling to pass the ball.

For these achievements, Chamberlain won his fourth and final MVP title. He also scored his 25,000th point, making him the first-ever player to score that many points; he gave the ball to team physician Stan Lorber. The Sixers won 62 games and took the first seed of the playoffs. In the Eastern Division Semifinals, they played against the New York Knicks. In a physically tough matchup, the Sixers lost sixth man Cunningham with a broken hand, and Chamberlain, Greer, and Jackson were struggling with inflamed feet, sore knees, and pulled hamstrings, respectively. Going ahead 3–2, the Sixers defeated the Knicks 115–97 in Game 6 after Chamberlain scored 25 points and 27 rebounds; Chamberlain had a successful series leading both teams in points (153), rebounds (145), and assists (38).

In the Eastern Division Finals, the Sixers played against the Boston Celtics, again with home-court advantage and this time as reigning champions. Despite the Sixers&#x27; injury woes, coach Hannum was confident that they could &quot;take the Celtics in less than seven games&quot;, and referenced the higher age of the Celtics, a team built around Russell and Jones, both 34. On April4, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. With eight of the ten starting players on the Sixers and Celtics being African-American, both teams were in deep shock and there were calls to cancel the series. In a game the following day, called &quot;unreal&quot; and &quot;devoid of emotion&quot;, the Sixers lost 127–118. After attending King&#x27;s funeral, Chamberlain called out to the angry rioters who were setting fires all over the country, stating King would not have approved. In Game 2, Philadelphia evened the series with a 115–106 victory, and won Games 3 and 4, with Chamberlain suspiciously often played by Celtics backup center Wayne Embry, causing the press to speculate Russell was worn down. Prior to Game 5, the Sixers seemed poised to win the series because no NBA team had overcome a 3–1 deficit before. The Celtics; however, rallied, winning the next two games 122–104 and 114–106, respectively, powered by a spirited John Havlicek and helped by the Sixers&#x27; poor shooting.

In Game 7, 15,202 Philadelphia fans witnessed a 100–96 defeat for the Sixers, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading 3–1. According to Cherry, the Sixers shot poorly—Greer, Jones, Walker, Jackson, and Guokas hit a combined 25 of 74 shots—while Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4-of-9 for a total of 14 points. In the second half of Game 7, Chamberlain did not attempt a shot from the field. Cherry said there is a strange pattern in that game because in a typical Sixers game, Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post but only 23 times in Game 7, with seven in the third quarter and twice in the fourth quarter. Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches, a point Hannum conceded. Cherry comments Chamberlain, who always thought of himself as the best player of all time, should have been outspoken enough to demand the ball.

The loss meant Chamberlain was 1–6 in playoff series against the Celtics. After that season, Hannum wanted to be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded ABA. Chamberlain then asked for a trade and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers. The motivation for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the purported Chamberlain–Richman deal. According to Ramsay, Chamberlain threatened to move to the ABA after Hannum left and forced the trade. According to Cherry, there are several personal reasons, among them Chamberlain feeling he had grown too big for Philadelphia and sought the presence of fellow celebrities, of which there were plenty in Los Angeles, and that he wanted the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in Los Angeles but less acceptable elsewhere.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1968–1973)===

====1968–69 NBA season: second NBA finals loss to the Celtics====

On July9, 1968, the trade between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Sixers was completed, making it the first time a reigning NBA MVP was traded the next season. Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke gave Chamberlain an unprecedented contract, paying him $250,000 after taxes—about $ million in real value; in comparison, previous Lakers top earner Jerry West was paid $100,000 before taxes—about $,000 in real value.

For the 1968–69 NBA season, Chamberlain joined a squad that included his fellow former All-American forward Elgin Baylor, Hall-of-Fame guard Jerry West, backup center Mel Counts, forwards Keith Erickson and Tom Hawkins, and guard Johnny Egan. According to Cherry, Chamberlain was not a natural leader or a loyal follower, which made it difficult to fit in. While he was on cordial terms with West, Chamberlain often argued with team captain Baylor, later saying in regard to Baylor: &quot;We were good friends, but ... [in] black culture ... you never let the other guy one-up you&quot;.

The lack of a second guard next to West and the lack of speed concerned coach Butch van Breda Kolff. After losing Clark and Hall-of-Fame guard Gail Goodrich, who joined the Phoenix Suns after the 1968 NBA expansion draft, he said: &quot;Egan gets murdered on defense because of his [lack of] size ... but if I don&#x27;t play him, we look like a bunch of trucks&quot;. The greatest problem was his tense relationship with van Breda Kolff. Pejoratively calling the new recruit &quot;The Load&quot;, van Breda Kolff later said Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice, and focused too much on his own statistics. Chamberlain described Van Breda Kolff as &quot;the dumbest and worst coach ever&quot;. Erickson commented, &quot;Butch catered to Elgin and Jerry ... and that is not a good way to get on Wilt&#x27;s side ... that relationship was doomed from the start&quot;.

Chamberlain experienced an often-frustrating season. Van Breda Kolff benched him several times, which never happened before in his career; in mid-season, Chamberlain, a perennial scoring champion, had two games in which he scored only six and then two points. Playing through his problems, Chamberlain averaged 20.5 points and 21.1 rebounds a game that season. Cooke was pleased because ticket sales went up by 11% since acquiring Chamberlain.

In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated 4–2 Chamberlain&#x27;s old club the San Francisco Warriors after losing the first two games, then defeated the Atlanta Hawks, and then played Chamberlain&#x27;s rivals, Russell&#x27;s Boston Celtics. Going into the NBA Finals as 3-to-1 favorites, the Lakers won the first two games but lost the next two; Chamberlain was criticized as a non-factor in the series, being neutralized by Russell with little effort. In Game 4, Sam Jones again hit a clutch shot, this time off the wrong foot.

In Game 5, Chamberlain scored 13 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, leading Los Angeles to a 117–104 win. In Game 6, Chamberlain recorded 18 rebounds and 4 assists but only 8 points, and the Celtics won 99–90. Cherry criticized his performance, saying if &quot;Chamberlain had come up big and put up a normal 30 point scoring night&quot;, the Lakers would have probably won their first championship in Los Angeles.

In Game 7, Cooke put up thousands of balloons in the rafters of the Forum in anticipation of a Lakers win, motivating the Celtics. In Game 7, the Lakers trailed 91–76 after three quarters but later rallied. Chamberlain twisted his knee after a rebound and had to be replaced by Counts. With three minutes to go, the Lakers trailed 103–102 but they committed costly turnovers and lost the game 108–106; this came despite a triple-double from West, who had 42 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists, and became the only player in NBA history to be named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team.

After the game, many wondered why Chamberlain sat out the final six minutes. At the time of his final substitution, Chamberlain had scored 18 points – hitting seven of his eight shots – and grabbed 27 rebounds, significantly more than the 10 points of Counts on 4-of-13 shooting. Among others, Russell did not believe Chamberlain&#x27;s injury was grave and accused him of being a malingerer, stating: &quot;Any injury short of a broken leg or a broken back is not enough&quot;. In spite of their earlier quarrels, Van Breda Kolff came to Chamberlain&#x27;s defense, saying the often-maligned Chamberlain hardly was able to move by the end. Van Breda Kolff was perceived as &quot;pig-headed&quot; for benching Chamberlain and soon resigned as Lakers coach. Cherry commented some journalists reported Game 7 destroyed two careers: &quot;Wilt&#x27;s because he wouldn&#x27;t take over and van Breda Kolff because he wouldn&#x27;t give in&quot;.

====1969–70 NBA season: first NBA finals loss to the Knicks====
Chamberlain began the 1969–70 NBA season under new coach Joe Mullaney strongly, averaging 32.2 points and 20.6 rebounds per game over the first nine games of the season. During the ninth game, he had a serious knee injury, suffering a rupture of the patellar tendon at the base of his right kneecap, and he missed several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season, the first season he failed to reach 20 rebounds per game. Owing to his strong start, he still put up a season-average 27.3 points, 18.4 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.

The Lakers again made the playoffs. In the first round, the Lakers defeated Goodrich, Connie Hawkins, and the Phoenix Suns in a seven-game series. The Lakers swept the Atlanta Hawks in the second round before ultimately reaching the NBA Finals, where they played against the New York Knicks, which included future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. Having lost lateral speed due to his injury, Chamberlain was often too slow to block Reed&#x27;s preferred high-post jump shots. The Knicks won Game 1 124–112 and Reed scored 37 points. In Game 2, Chamberlain scored 19 points, grabbed 24 rebounds, and blocked Reed&#x27;s shot in the final seconds, leading the Lakers to a 105–103 win. In Game 3, West hit a shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102 but the Knicks won in overtime 111–108. In Game 4, Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds, helping tie the series at 2.

In Game 5, with the Knicks trailing by more than nine points, Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be out for the series. By convention, Chamberlain should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket Jr., or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere, who gave up more than against him. Instead, the Lakers gave away their 13-point halftime lead, succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense, and committed 19 second-half turnovers. Chamberlain and West—the Lakers&#x27; two main scorers—shot the ball only thrice and twice, respectively, in the entire second half. The Lakers lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history.

In Game 6, Chamberlain scored 45 points, grabbed 27 rebounds, and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135–113 Lakers win. With Reed out; the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York City; however, the hero of Game 7 was Reed, who hobbled up court, scored the first four points, and inspired his team to one of the most-famous playoff upsets of all time. The Knicks led by 27 at halftime, and despite Chamberlain scoring 21 points, the Lakers had their third consecutive loss in Game 7. Chamberlain was criticized for his inability to dominate his injured counterpart but according to Cherry, Chamberlain&#x27;s feat, coming back from a career-threatening injury, was too-quickly forgotten.

====1970–71 NBA season: conference finals loss and challenge to Muhammad Ali====
In the 1970–71 NBA season, the Lakers signed Gail Goodrich, who had returned from the Suns. Chamberlain averaged 20.7 points, 18.2 rebounds, and 4.3 assists; he once again led the NBA in rebounding and the Lakers won the Pacific Division title. When Hall-of-Fame Detroit Pistons center Bob Lanier, who was and as a rookie, was asked about the most memorable moment of his career, Lanier answered: &quot;When Wilt Chamberlain lifted me up and moved me like a coffee cup so he could get a favorable position&quot;.

After losing Baylor to an Achilles tendon rupture that effectively ended his career, and especially after losing West after a knee injury, the Lakers were seen as underdogs in the playoffs against the Milwaukee Bucks of Alcindor—freshly crowned MVP—and the veteran Hall-of-Fame guard Robertson, whom they played in the Western Conference Finals. After winning the regular season with 66 wins, the Bucks were seen as favorites against the depleted Lakers; many pundits were looking forward to the matchup between the 34-year-old Chamberlain and the 24-year-old Alcindor. In Game 1, Alcindor outscored Chamberlain 32–22 and the Bucks won 106–85. In Game 2, the Bucks won again despite Chamberlain scoring 26 points—four more than his Milwaukee counterpart. Prior to Game 3, the Lakers&#x27; situation worsened when West&#x27;s stand-in Erickson underwent an appendectomy and was out for the season. With rookie Jim McMillian easing the scoring pressure, Chamberlain scored 24 points and grabbed 24 rebounds in a 118–107 victory but the Bucks defeated the Lakers 117–94 in Game 4 to take a 3–1 series lead. Milwaukee ended the series at home with a 116–98 victory in Game 5. Although Chamberlain lost, he was lauded for holding his own against MVP Alcindor, who was 10 years younger and healthy.
After the playoffs, Chamberlain challenged heavyweight boxing legend Muhammad Ali to a fight. Chamberlain trained with Cus d&#x27;Amato for the 15-round bout, set to take place on July26, 1971, in the Houston Astrodome. Ali refused to be intimidated, issuing his typical public boasts, this time of &quot;Timber!&quot; and &quot;The tree will fall!&quot;. In 1965, Chamberlain consulted his father, who had seen Ali fight, and advised Chamberlain against it. Cooke offered Chamberlain a record-setting contract on the condition he agreed to give up what Cooke termed &quot;this boxing foolishness&quot;. Chamberlain ultimately used a contractual escape; Joe Frazier gave Ali his first professional loss, enabling Chamberlain to legally withdraw from the bout. Retired NFL player Jim Brown, who acted as Chamberlain&#x27;s manager since 1967, got Ali&#x27;s manager Jabir Herbert Muhammad to mutually withdraw from the match set to take place at Madison Square Garden.

====1971–72 NBA season: finals MVP and second NBA title====
In the 1971–72 NBA season, the Lakers hired former Celtics star guard Bill Sharman as head coach. Sharman introduced morning shoot-arounds, in which the perennial latecomer Chamberlain regularly participated, in contrast to earlier years with Schayes, and transformed him into a defensive-minded, low-scoring post defender in the style of Russell. Sharman told Chamberlain to use his rebounding and passing skills to quickly initiate fastbreaks to his teammates. While no longer being the main scorer, Chamberlain was named the Lakers&#x27; new captain. After rupturing his Achilles tendon, perennial captain Baylor retired and was replaced with Chamberlain. Initially, Sharman wanted Chamberlain and West to share this duty but West declined, stating he was injury-prone and wanted to concentrate on the game. Chamberlain accepted his new roles and posted an all-time low 14.8 points per game but also 19.2 rebounds per game, and led the league with a .649 field-goal percentage. Powered by his defensive presence, the Lakers had an unprecedented 33-game winning streak, leading to a then-record 69 wins in the regular season. According to Flynn Robinson, after the record-setting streak, Lakers owner Cooke sought to reward each of his players, who may have been expecting a trip to Hawaii, with a $5 pen set. In response, Chamberlain had everybody put the pens in the middle of the floor and stepped on them.
In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the Chicago Bulls then played against the Milwaukee Bucks, who were led by young center and regular-season MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (formerly Lew Alcindor). &quot;Life&quot; called the matchup between Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar the greatest matchup in all sports. Chamberlain helped the Lakers defeat Abdul-Jabbar and the Bucks in six games, and he was lauded for his performance in Game 6, which the Lakers won 104–100 after trailing by 10 points in the fourth quarter. Chamberlain scored 24 points, grabbed 22 rebounds, played all 48 minutes, and outsprinted the younger Bucks center on several late Lakers fast breaks. West called it &quot;the greatest ball-busting performance I have ever seen&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; stated, &quot;In the N.B.A.&#x27;s western division title series with Milwaukee, [Chamberlain] decisively outplayed basketball&#x27;s newest giant superstar, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, eleven years his junior&quot;.

In the NBA Finals, the Lakers again met the New York Knicks, who were shorthanded after losing Reed to injury, and undersized Jerry Lucas had to defend against Chamberlain. Prolific outside shooter Lucas helped New York to win Game 1, hitting 9 of his 11 shots in the first half. In Game 2, which the Lakers won 106–92, Chamberlain put Lucas into foul trouble and the Knicks lost defensive power forward Dave DeBusschere to injury. In Game 3, Chamberlain scored 26 points and grabbed 20 rebounds for another Lakers win.

In a fiercely battled Game 4, Chamberlain was playing with five fouls late in the game. Chamberlain had never fouled out in his career, a record for which he was very proud. Despite the risk of fouling out, Chamberlain played aggressive defense, and blocked two of Lucas&#x27; shots in overtime, proving wrong those who said he only played for his own statistics. He also scored a game-high 27 points and, at one point, fell on his right hand, and was thought to have sprained it, but it was broken.

For Game 5, Chamberlain&#x27;s hands were packed into thick pads that were normally used by defensive linemen in football; he was offered a painkilling shot but refused for fear he would lose his shooting touch if his hands became numb. Chamberlain recorded 24 points, 29 rebounds, 8 assists, and 8 blocked shots; announcer Keith Jackson counted the blocks during the broadcast. Chamberlain&#x27;s all-around performance helped the Lakers win their first championship in Los Angeles with a decisive 114–100 win. Chamberlain was named the Finals MVP, and admired for playing while injured.

====1972–73 NBA season: second NBA finals loss to the Knicks====
The 1972–73 NBA season was Chamberlain&#x27;s last; the Lakers lost substance—Happy Hairston was injured, Robinson and LeRoy Ellis had left, and West struggled with injury. Chamberlain averaged 13.2 points and 18.6 rebounds to win the rebounding title for the 11th time in his career. He also shot an NBA record 0.727 for the season, bettering his own mark of 0.683 from the 1966–67 season. It was the ninth time Chamberlain led the league in field-goal percentage. The Lakers won 60 games in the regular season and reached the NBA Finals against the New York Knicks, a franchise that had a healthy team with a rejuvenated Reed whereas the Lakers were handicapped by several injuries. In that series, the Lakers began with a 115–112 win but the Knicks won Games 2 and 3; and West again injured his hamstring. In Game 4, the shorthanded Lakers were defeated by the Knicks. In Game 5, the valiant-but-injured West and Hairston had bad games, and the Lakers lost the game 102–93 and the series 4–1 despite Chamberlain scoring 23 points and grabbing 21 rebounds. After the Knicks finished the game with a late flourish led by Phil Jackson and Earl Monroe, Chamberlain made a dunk with one second left, which was the last play of his NBA career.

==Coaching career==

===San Diego Conquistadors (1973–1974)===

In 1973, the San Diego Conquistadors, a member of the NBA-rival league ABA, signed Chamberlain as a player-coach for a $600,000 salary. According to Chamberlain, part of the reason for leaving the Lakers was his belief he had the right to renegotiate his contract after winning the 1971–72 NBA championship, and was upset the Lakers did not contact him until September 1972, before which they were trying to acquire UCLA star-center Bill Walton, who ultimately decided to return to school for the 1972–73 season. The Lakers sued Chamberlain and prevented him from playing for the Conquistadors because he still owed the Lakers the option year of his contract. According to the two-year contract Chamberlain had signed prior to the 1971–72 season, if he failed to sign and mail back his next contract, his contract with the Lakers would be deemed to be renewed. The Lakers said they mailed Chamberlain a new contract in July 1973, but Chamberlain did not sign it, so the old contract should be deemed to have been renewed for the 1973–74 season. On October10, 1973, the opening day of the Conquistadors&#x27; season, a judge ruled Chamberlain could coach the Conquistadors but could not play for any team other than the Lakers for 1973–74.

While he was barred from playing, Chamberlain mostly left coaching duties to his assistant Stan Albeck, who said Chamberlain &quot;has a great feel for pro basketball ... the day-to-day things that are an important part of basketball ... just bored him. He did not have the patience.&quot; The players were split on Chamberlain, who was seen as competent but often indifferent, and was more occupied with promotion of his autobiography &quot;Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door,&quot; than with coaching. He once skipped a game to sign autographs for the book. In his single season as a coach, the Conquistadors finished 37–47 in the regular season and lost against the Utah Stars in the division semifinals. After the season, Chamberlain retired from professional basketball; he was displeased by the meager attendance as crowds averaged 1,843, occupying just over half of the team&#x27;s 3,200-seat Golden Hall sports arena.

==NBA career statistics==
===Regular season===

The NBA started to keep track of blocked shots the season after Wilt retired.

===Playoffs===
==Post-NBA career==
After his stint with the Conquistadors, Chamberlain went into business and entertainment, made money in stocks and real estate, bought a popular Harlem nightclub which he renamed Big Wilt&#x27;s Smalls Paradise, and invested in broodmares. He appeared in advertisements for TWA, American Express, Volkswagen, Drexel Burnham, Le Tigre Clothing, Foot Locker, and Lite beer from Miller. 

=== Athletics ===
Chamberlain sponsored his own professional volleyball and track and field teams, and provided high-level teams for girls and women in basketball, track, volleyball, and softball.

Volleyball became Chamberlain&#x27;s new athletic passion, having been a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days. He became a board member of the newly founded International Volleyball Association (IVA) in 1974 and became its president in 1975. As a testament to his importance, the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it; he was named the game&#x27;s MVP. Chamberlain played occasional matches for IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979. Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively he was named to the IVA Hall of Fame and became one of the few athletes who were enshrined in multiple sports.

In the 1970s, Chamberlain formed Wilt&#x27;s Athletic Club, a track-and-field club in southern California that was coached by UCLA assistant coach Bob Kersee in the early part of his career. The team included Florence Griffith before she set the world records in the 100 meters and 200 meters; three-time world champion Greg Foster; and future Olympic Gold medalists Andre Phillips, Alice Brown, and Jeanette Bolden. Chamberlain signed 60 athletes and planned to expand to 100. While actively promoting the sport in 1982, Chamberlain said he was considering a return to athletic competition in masters athletics; he stated he had only once been beaten in the high jump by Olympic champion Charles Dumas, and that he had never been beaten in shot put, beating Olympic shot put champion Al Oerter.

Following his playing days, Chamberlain maintained his high level of fitness. In his mid-forties, he was able to humble rookie Magic Johnson in practice, and he planned a return to the NBA in the 1980s. In the 1980–81 NBA season, coach Larry Brown said the 45-year-old Chamberlain had received an offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers. When Chamberlain was 50, the New Jersey Nets made Chamberlain an offer, which he declined. He continued to maintain his physical fitness for several years, participating in several marathons. When million-dollar contracts became common in the NBA, Chamberlain increasingly felt he had been underpaid during his career. A result of this resentment was the 1997 book &quot;Who&#x27;s Running the Asylum? Inside the Insane World of Sports Today&quot;, in which he criticized the NBA for being too disrespectful of former players.

=== Film ===
In 1976, Chamberlain, who was interested in movies, forming a film production and distribution company to make his first film, which was entitled &quot;Go For It&quot;. Chamberlain played a villainous warrior and counterpart of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1984 film &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot;, including fight scenes against Schwarzenegger and Grace Jones. It remained his only credited film role.

In November 1998, he signed with Ian Ng Cheng Hin, CEO of Northern Cinema House Entertainment, to produce his own bio-pic, wanting to tell his life story his way. He had been working on the screenplay notes for over a year at the time of his death.

==Death==
Chamberlain, who had a history of cardiovascular disease, was briefly hospitalized for an irregular heartbeat in 1992. According to those close to him, he began taking medication for his heart problems. His condition rapidly deteriorated in 1999, and he lost . After undergoing dental surgery in the week before his death, he was in great pain and seemed unable to recover from the stress. On October12, 1999, Chamberlain died at age 63 at his home in Bel Air. His longtime attorney, Sy Goldberg, stated Chamberlain died of congestive heart failure. Goldberg said:
He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew. He was writing a screenplay about his life. He was interested in world affairs, sometimes he&#x27;d call me up late at night and discuss philosophy. I think he&#x27;ll be remembered as a great man. He happened to make a living playing basketball, but he was more than that. He could talk on any subject. He was a Goliath.

A memorial service for Chamberlain was held at the City of Angels Church of Religious Science in Los Angeles on October 16, 1999. A second memorial service was held at his home church, Mount Carmel Baptist Church, in Philadelphia on October 21, 1999.

Several NBA players and officials were saddened at Chamberlain&#x27;s death; they remembered him as one of the greatest players in the history of basketball. On-court rival and personal friend Bill Russell stated: &quot;the fierceness of our competition bonded us together for eternity&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Awards and honors===
Chamberlain is regarded as one of the most extraordinary and dominant basketball players in NBA history. Contemporaneous colleagues were often terrified of playing against Chamberlain. Russell regularly feared being embarrassed by Chamberlain, and Walt Frazier called his dominance on the court &quot;comical&quot;.

Chamberlain holds numerous official NBA all-time records. Former teammate Billy Cunningham said, &quot;The NBA Guide reads like Wilt&#x27;s personal diary.&quot; He was a scoring champion, all-time top rebounder, and accurate field-goal shooter. He led the NBA in scoring seven times, field-goal percentage nine times, minutes played eight times, rebounding eleven times, and assists once. Chamberlain is most remembered for his 100-point game, which is widely considered one of basketball&#x27;s greatest records. Decades after his record, many NBA teams did not average 100 points.

In high school and college, Chamberlain was Mr. Basketball USA, NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player in 1957, and twice consensus first-team All-American in 1957 and 1958. His number 13 jersey was retired by the Kansas Jayhawks, Harlem Globetrotters, Golden State Warriors, Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Lakers. Chamberlain won two NBA championships, four regular-season Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, the Rookie of the Year award, one Finals MVP award, and one All-Star Game MVP award, and was selected to 13 All-Star Games and 10 All-NBA Teams—seven First and three Second teams. He also twice made All-Defensive First Team.

During his NBA career, Chamberlain committed few fouls despite his rugged play in the post, and he never fouled out of a regular-season or playoff game in his 14-year NBA career. His career average was two fouls per game despite having averaged 45.8 minutes per game over his career. He had five seasons in which he committed fewer than two fouls per game, and a career-low of 1.5 fouls during the 1962 season, in which he also averaged 50.4 points per game. His fouls per 36 minutes—a statistic that is used to compare players who average vastly different minutes—was 1.6 per game.

Chamberlain&#x27;s game evolved during his playing career. Chamberlain&#x27;s Lakers coach Bill Sharman said, &quot;First he was a scorer. Then he was a rebounder and assist man. Then with our great Laker team in 1972, he concentrated on the defensive end.&quot; During his two-championship seasons, Chamberlain led the league in rebounding while his scoring decreased. During his first championship season, his assists also increased, recording two consecutive seasons with eight assists per game, and winning one assist title. By 1971–72, at age 35 and running less, his game was averaging only nine shots per game compared to the 40 in his record-setting 1961–62 season. During Chamberlain&#x27;s time, defensive statistics like blocks and steals had not yet been recorded. According to 1960s Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay, &quot;Harvey [Pollack] said he used to tell one of his statisticians to keep track of Wilt&#x27;s blocks in big games ... One night, they got up to 25&quot;. Reported data for 112 games played by Chamberlain for the Lakers in the 1970s shows he averaged 8.8 blocks per game.

For his feats, Chamberlain was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978, named part of the NBA 35th Anniversary Team in 1980, one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, and was ranked 13th in ESPN&#x27;s list &quot;Top North American Athletes of the Century&quot; in 1999. In 2007, ESPN rather Chamberlain the second-best center of all time by behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and was ranked second in &quot;Slam&quot;″s &quot;Top 50 NBA Players of All-Time in NBA History&quot; in 2009, and sixth in ESPN&#x27;s list of the top 74 NBA players of all time in 2020, and the third-best center of all-time behind Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. In 2022, Chamberlain was ranked fifth in ESPN&#x27;s list of the NBA 75th Anniversary Team, and sixth in a similar list by &quot;The Athletic&quot;.

===Rule changes===
Part of Chamberlain&#x27;s impact on basketball is his direct responsibility for several rule changes in the NBA, including a widening of the lane to try to keep big men more distant from the basket, the instituting of offensive goaltending, a ban on dunking to convert free throws, and a revision of rules governing inbounding the ball, such as making it illegal to inbound the ball over the backboard. In basketball history, pundits have stated the only other player who forced such a massive change of rules is Minneapolis Lakers center George Mikan, who played a decade before Chamberlain and also caused many rule changes designed to thwart dominant centers, such as a widening the lane and defensive goaltending.

===Chamberlain–Russell rivalry===
The on-court rivalry between Chamberlain and Bill Russell is cited as one of the greatest of all time. Russell won 11 NBA titles in his career while Chamberlain won two. Chamberlain was named All-NBA First Team seven times in comparison to Russell&#x27;s three but Russell was named the NBA MVP—then selected by players—five times against Chamberlain&#x27;s four. Russell&#x27;s Celtics won seven of eight playoff series against Chamberlain&#x27;s Warriors, 76ers, and Lakers teams, and went 57–37 against them in the regular season and 29–20 in the playoffs. Russell&#x27;s teams won all four series-deciding seventh games against Chamberlain&#x27;s by a combined margin of nine points.

The comparison between Chamberlain and Russell is often simplified to one between a great player (Chamberlain) with a player who makes his team great (Russell); an individualist against a team player. Chamberlain would say Boston did not rely on Russell&#x27;s scoring, and that Russell could concentrate on defense and rebounding. Chamberlain went on: &quot;I&#x27;ve got to hit forty points or so, or this team is in trouble. I must score—understand? After that I play defense and get the ball off the boards. I try to do them all, best I can, but scoring comes first.&quot; Chamberlain outscored Russell 30 to 14.2 and out-rebounded him 28.2 to 22.9 in the regular season, and he outscored Russell 25.7 to 14.9, and out-rebounded Russell 28 to 24.7 in the playoffs.

Russell and Chamberlain were friends in private life. Russell never considered Chamberlain his rival and disliked the term, preferring &quot;competitors&quot;, and also said they rarely talked about basketball when they were alone. When Chamberlain died in 1999, Chamberlain&#x27;s nephew stated Russell was the second person whom he was ordered to inform. While previously friends, after Russell criticized Chamberlain for his performance during Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals, the two men did not speak for two decades. Russell privately apologized to Chamberlain and later publicly apologized in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas. The 1969 NBA Finals is arguably the biggest stain on Chamberlain&#x27;s career; supporters of Chamberlain said Russell won more games because he had better-skilled teammates; in the finals; however, Chamberlain&#x27;s team was favored and lost.

===Reputation as a loser===

Although Chamberlain accumulated some of the most-impressive statistics in the history of professional sports, he was often called selfish and a loser because he won only two NBA championships and lost seven out of eight playoff series against Bill Russell&#x27;s Celtics teams. Frank Deford of ESPN said Chamberlain was caught in a no-win situation: &quot;If you win, everybody says, &#x27;Well, look at him, he&#x27;s that big&#x27;. If you lose, everybody says, &#x27;How could he lose, a guy that size?&#x27; &quot; Quoting coach Alex Hannum&#x27;s explanation of his situation, Chamberlain often said: &quot;Nobody roots for Goliath&quot;.

Rick Barry wrote: 
I&#x27;ll say what most players feel, which is that Wilt is a loser ... He is terrible in big games. He knows he is going to lose and be blamed for the loss, so he dreads it, and you can see it in his eyes; and anyone who has ever played with him will agree with me, regardless of whether they would admit it publicly ... When it comes down to the closing minutes of a tough game, an important game, he doesn&#x27;t want the ball, he doesn&#x27;t want any part of the pressure. It is at these times that greatness is determined and Wilt doesn&#x27;t have it. There is no way you can compare him to a pro like a Bill Russell or a Jerry West ... these are clutch competitors.

Chamberlain&#x27;s main weakness was his poor free-throw shooting, a .511 career average, the third-lowest in NBA history, with a low of .380 over the 1967–68 season. Chamberlain later said he was a &quot;psycho case&quot; in this matter. Much like later center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Chamberlain would be intentionally fouled and was a target of criticism because of it. Many suggestions were offered; he shot them underhanded, one-handed, two-handed, from the side of the circle, from well behind the line, and banked it in. Coach Hannum once suggested Chamberlain shoot his fadeaway jumper as a free throw but Chamberlain feared drawing more attention to his main failing.

Despite his foul-line problems, Chamberlain set the NBA record, which was later equaled by Adrian Dantley, for the most free throws made (28) using the underhand technique in a regular-season game in his 1962 100-point game. Chamberlain later said he was too embarrassed by the underhand technique to continue using it, although it consistently gave him better results. Chamberlain stated he intentionally missed free throws so a teammate could get the rebound and score two points instead of one.

==Personal life==

===Star status===
Chamberlain was the first big earner of basketball; upon entering the NBA, he immediately became the highest-paid player. Chamberlain was basketball&#x27;s first player to earn at least $100,000 a year; and he earned an unprecedented $1.5 million during his Lakers years. As a Philadelphia 76er, he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia. He would often stay out late into the night and wake up at noon.

Jazz composer Thad Jones named the music composition &quot;Big Dipper&quot; after Chamberlain. When he became a Laker, Chamberlain built a million-dollar mansion in Bel-Air and named it after Ursa Major, a play on his nickname &quot;The Big Dipper&quot;. It had a pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury. Cherry described Chamberlain&#x27;s house as a miniature Playboy Mansion, where he regularly held parties and lived his later-notorious sex life. This was also helped by the fact Chamberlain was a near-insomniac who often skipped sleep. The house was designed according to Chamberlain&#x27;s preferences; it had no right angles, and had an X-rated room with mirrored walls and a fur-covered waterbed. Chamberlain lived alone, relying on many automated gadgets, with two cats named Zip and Zap, and several Great Dane dogs. Chamberlain drove a Ferrari, a Bentley, and a Le Mans-style car called Searcher One that was designed and built at a cost of $750,000 in 1996.

Following his death in 1999, Chamberlain&#x27;s estate was valued at $25 million.

===Love life===
Although Chamberlain was shy and insecure as a teenager, he later became known for his womanizing. According to his lawyer Seymour Goldberg, &quot;Some people collect stamps, Wilt collected women&quot;. Swedish Olympic high jumper Annette Tånnander, who met Chamberlain when he was 40 and she was 19, said he was a pick-up artist who was extremely confident yet respectful, saying: &quot;I think Wilt hit on everything that moved ... he never was bad or rude&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist David Shaw said Chamberlain was &quot;rude and sexist toward his own date, as he usually was&quot; during a dinner with Shaw and his wife; he added at one point Chamberlain left the table to get the telephone number of an attractive woman at a nearby table.

In Chamberlain&#x27;s second book &quot;A View from Above&quot;, he claimed to have had sex with 20,000 women. According to his contemporary Rod Roddewig, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain had sex with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a ten-day period, there were 23 checks in the book; a rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain halved that number to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive and subtracted 15 years, giving him the 20,000 number.

In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later said: &quot;the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That&#x27;s the reason why I was single.&quot; In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate at the time of his promiscuity and warned other men who admired him for it, saying: &quot;With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I&#x27;ve found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying&quot;. Chamberlain also said he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children.

In 2015, a man named Aaron Levi claimed to be Chamberlain&#x27;s son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain&#x27;s sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi&#x27;s claim has not been conclusively proved.

===Relationships===
According to Cherry, although Chamberlain was an egotist, he had good relationships with many of his contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect. He was lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Jack Ramsay said Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying the attention. Jerry West called Chamberlain a &quot;complex ... very nice person&quot;, and NBA rival Jack McMahon said: &quot;The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person ... he could have killed us all with his left hand&quot;. Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy assumed if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles.

During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell; he often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving and visited Russell&#x27;s home, where conversation mostly concerned Russell&#x27;s electric trains. As the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship deteriorated and became hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of &quot;copping out&quot; in Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two reconciled after two decades but Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted he had not been &quot;more physical&quot; with Russell in their games, and privately continued accusing his rival of negatively intellectualizing basketball.

Chamberlain&#x27;s relationship with fellow center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, eleven years his junior, was hostile. Although Abdul-Jabbar idolized Chamberlain as a teenager and was once part of his inner circle, the student–mentor bond deteriorated into intense mutual loathing, especially after Chamberlain retired. Chamberlain often criticized Abdul-Jabbar for a perceived lack of scoring, rebounding, and defense. Abdul-Jabbar accused Chamberlain of being a traitor to the black race for his Republican political leanings, support of Richard Nixon, and relationships with white women. When Abdul-Jabbar broke Chamberlain&#x27;s all-time scoring record in 1984, Chamberlain criticized Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s game and called on him to retire. When Abdul-Jabbar published his autobiography in 1990, he wrote a paper titled &quot;To Wilt Chumperlane&quot;, in which he stated: &quot;Now that I am done playing, history will remember me as someone who helped teammates to win, while you will be remembered as a crybaby, a loser, and a quitter&quot;. Their relationship remained mostly strained until Chamberlain&#x27;s death.

===Politics===
Chamberlain denounced the Black Panthers Party and other black nationalist movements in the late 1960s, and he supported Republican Richard Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. Chamberlain accompanied Nixon to the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. and considered himself a Republican.

===Sexual assault allegation===
In 2021, actress Cassandra Peterson, who is primarily known for her alter ego Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, said in her memoir, &quot;Yours Cruelly, Elvira: Memoirs of the Mistress of the Dark&quot;, that Chamberlain had sexually assaulted her during a party at his mansion in the 1970s. Chamberlain supposedly forced Peterson to perform oral sex after offering to show her a closet containing his NBA jerseys. Peterson stated she had blamed herself and was almost &quot;convinced that I was a very bad person for letting that happen&quot; until the Me Too movement made her reconsider the experience. Peterson felt the assault was &quot;creepier&quot; because Chamberlain had been a friend.

<text>Walter James Redfern Turner (13 October 1889 – 18 November 1946) was an Australian-born, English-domiciled writer and critic.

==Life==

Born in South Melbourne, the son of a church musician – organist at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral – and warehouseman, Walter James Turner, and Alice May (née Watson), he was educated at Carlton State School, Scotch College and the Working Men&#x27;s College. In 1907 he left for England to pursue a career in writing. There he met and befriended a number of literary intellectual figures, including Siegfried Sassoon, Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West, and Lady Ottoline Morrell (the caricature of her in his book &quot;The Aesthetes&quot; ended their friendship). On 5 April 1918, in Chelsea, he married Delphine Marguerite Dubuis (died 1951). During the period from the First World War until the mid-1930s, he was known primarily as a poet. His 1916 &quot;Romance&quot; (&quot;Chimborazo, Cotopaxi...&quot;) is probably the best remembered of his poems.

W. B. Yeats had the highest praise for Turner&#x27;s poetry, saying that it left him &quot;lost in admiration and astonishment&quot;, and included some of it in his &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Poetry&quot; (while omitting several authors very much better known today for their verse, such as Wilfred Owen). But today, although Turner produced several novels and plays, as well as books of poems, his reputation rests on his biographies of the composers Mozart, Beethoven and Berlioz. His &quot;Mozart&quot; has been reprinted many times since it was first published in 1938. Some of his music articles for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; (where he was music critic between 1915 and 1940) and other journals were reprinted in &quot;Music and Life&quot;, &quot;Facing the Music&quot;, &quot;Musical Meanderings&quot;, and &quot;Variations on the theme of Music&quot;.

Turner was musically untrained, and in the words of the music critic Charles Reid, &quot;unhampered by any excess of technical knowledge&quot; to restrain his &quot;racy dogmatism&quot;. Notoriously, on the fiftieth anniversary of Richard Wagner&#x27;s death, he wrote: “I can confidently and in soberness declare that Wagner is a colossal fraud.” 

Turner was a close friend of the pianist Artur Schnabel, about whom he frequently wrote, and with whom he frequently went hiking. He was a champion of Arturo Toscanini&#x27;s conducting, which was for him a revelation in structure and expression. Siegfried Sassoon was another close friend of Turner, at least for a while. Turner, his wife, and Sassoon all cohabited a house in London, No 54 Tufton Street, before Sassoon moved out in 1925. After this he fell out with Turner so badly that he made no mention whatsoever of him in his autobiography. During the Second World War, he was general editor of the series of short illustrated books &quot;Britain in Pictures&quot;, for which he wrote the volumes on music and ballet, and edited seven omnibus volumes. On 18 November 1946 he died at Hammersmith of a cerebral thrombosis.

<text>Nueva Ecija, officially the Province of Nueva Ecija ( , ; ; ; ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region. Its capital is the city of Palayan, while Cabanatuan, its former capital, is the largest local government unit (LGU). Nueva Ecija borders, from the south clockwise, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Pangasinan, Nueva Vizcaya and Aurora. The province is nationally known as the &quot;Rice Granary of the Philippines&quot;, producing the largest rice yield in the country.

==History==
===Early history===
These first settlers included tribes of Bugkalots or Italons, Abaca and Buquids. Settlements were built along the banks following the river&#x27;s undulations. The Ilongots, meaning people of the forest, were the fierce headhunters and animist tribes who occupied Carranglan and the mountainous terrain of Sierra Madre and Caraballo. The head hunting communities were nestled along the riverbanks of Rio Grande&#x27;s tributaries in the north. Abaca and Italon were subgroups of Bugkalot people, meaning river settlers. Ilongots survived mainly by fishing and hunting. Food production was a secondary occupation. The agriculture-based community of Caraclans and Buquids were settled in Bongabon and Pantabangan along the riverbanks of Rio Grande&#x27;s tributaries in the northeast.

When the waves of Tagalog migrations took place between 300 and 200 B.C., intrepid travelers and traders set up settlements along Luzon&#x27;s western coast. These early settlements formed the nucleus of the Pampango Empire that was consolidated by Balagtas. The flatlands of the southern portion of Upper Pampanga was a hospitable place for these new Tagalog settlers. The indigenous tribes were forced to take to the hills in the face of the Tagalogs&#x27; superior technology.

Barter trade flourished among communities that settled along the great river. The constant riverside trading resulted in both a commercial and cultural exchange between the settlements in vast plains upstream of the Pampanga River. Settlements in Carranglan, Pantabangan, and Bongabon and prospered and grew into more stable communities.

===Spanish colonial era===
At the time, the Pampango crown has waned and had little resistance from Spanish invasion. When the Pampango Empire fell into the hands of Spanish forces under the command of Martin de Goiti in 1572, the conquistadores began their long upward trek towards Cagayan Valley and Mountain Province. Their forces passed through the settlement areas of the Upper Pampanga River. They also attacked the Caboloan of Pangasinan, effectively capturing more territories from local kingdoms.

Because of growing territorial domain and evangelical missions, a command outpost or Commandancia in the Upper Pampanga River area was established. Then Governor-General Fausto Cruzat y Góngora (July 25, 1690, to December 8, 1701) had most likely spent much of his time in the northern outpost in Carranglan and Pantabangan and, baking in the fiercely hot climate, probably waxed nostalgic about his hometown in Écija, Andalusia in Spain, which was also known as &quot;la sarten&quot; (the frying pan) because of its intensely hot summers. Thus the Governor-General hit upon the notion to name the outpost Nueva Ecija. Both the New and Old Ecija were washed by navigable rivers- the former, by Pampanga River and the latter, by the river Genil.

==== Conversion to Christianity ====
Consistent with the history of Hispanization in the rest of Philippine archipelago, Nueva Ecija was established by Augustinian missionaries. The first mission was established in Gapan in 1595. The Augustinians abandoned their missionary work in 1636, maintaining only the mission in Bongabon.

At the turn of the 18th century, the missionaries resumed their evangelical work and redirected their efforts to the northeast, towards rough, mountainous terrain inhabited by the Bugkalots.

On September 1, 1759, King Carlos III of Spain issued a Royal Decree that ended the founding missions of Augustinians and transferred all Augustinian responsibilities in the settlements of Nueva Ecija to Franciscan friars. Through tribute collections and &quot;polo y servicio&quot; or rendering of force labor, the Franciscans constructed churches, convents, parochial schools and tribunals. They also constructed roads and bridges to connect other settlements. In 1781, a simple irrigation system was constructed in Pantabangan. This new farming technology contributed to the promotion of agriculture in the province.

====New province====
To make possible the establishments of settlements, military force became necessary to protect the friars and whatever basic settlement structures were beginning to emerge. Thus military outposts were of utmost importance, especially with the friars trying to convert fierce head-hunting tribes with spears and bladed weapons. It was around this time, during the term of Governor General Fausto Cruzat y Gongora (July 25, 1690, to December 8, 1702), that he established the military outpost he named Nueva Ecija. At this time, however, Nueva Ecija was still part of upper Pampanga.

In 1762, British occupation of Manila happened, and many Tagalog refugees from Manila &amp; north areas of Cavite escaped to Bulacan and Nueva Ecija, where the original Kapampangan settlers welcomed them. Nueva Ecija, along with Bulacan, was natively Kapampangan when Spaniards arrived. Majority of Kapampangans sold their lands to the newly arrived Tagalog settlers and others intermarried with and assimilated to the Tagalog, which made Nueva Ecija dominantly Tagalog, many of the Tagalog settlers arrived in Nueva Ecija directly from Bulacan.

In 2016, researchers of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) and the provincial government found documents showing that in 1799, Carlos IV ordered the separation of towns and parishes of Upper Pampanga, near the Sierra Madre range, as well as coastal towns of Tayabas, along the Pacific Ocean and their organization into a corregimiento (political-military administrative unit). Royal directives were implemented on April 25, 1801, and the corregimiento was named Nueva Ecija after the Spanish hometown of that period&#x27;s Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar, with Baler as its capital.

Since then, the province had undergone numerous changes in territorial composition. The progressive towns of Gapan, San Isidro, San Antonio, Cabiao and Aliaga were all annexed to Nueva Ecija from Pampanga, resulting in an economic as well as population boom for inhabitants. While Nueva Ecija only had a population of 9,165 in 1845, the annexation of new territories three years later pegged the population at 69,135. In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of Palanan from Isabela, as well as Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and part of Rizal.

Other changes occurred in the following years until, in 1901, Nueva Ecija&#x27;s northern municipalities of Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin and Umingan were annexed to Pangasinan. Nueva Ecija&#x27;s shifting political boundaries in fact necessitated transferring its provincial capital four times. Still, these changes proved ultimately beneficial to Nueva Ecija, as they resulted in a territory with rich land resources nourished by an excellent river system composed of the Pampanga, Talavera and Penaranda rivers. This would help lay the foundation for Nueva Ecija&#x27;s abundant agricultural economy starting with the American Occupation in the early 20th century.

====Tobacco monopoly====
Maintaining the Philippines as a colony became a challenge for the Spanish Empire. Expenses incurred in running the colony were usually paid for by a yearly subsidy (called real situado) sent from the Philippines&#x27; sister colony in Mexico. This financial support from the Spanish royal court was often insufficient, especially with expenditures in the Philippine colony growing each year.

This prompted the royal fiscal assigned in Manila to devise a plan to allow the colony itself to raise revenues on its own and thus be able to supplement the Spanish subsidy. This royal fiscal was Francisco Leandro de Vianna, who first proposed creating a tobacco monopoly. De Vianna reasoned, tobacco was a product widely consumed throughout the islands, with a market of roughly one million. He projected earnings of as much as P400,000 from the venture. The first time the proposal was made, however, both King Carlos III of Spain and colonial officials didn&#x27;t give the idea much importance.

All that would change during the term of Governor-General Jose Basco y Vargas. Basco had plans to develop and promote Philippine agriculture, and de Vianna&#x27;s proposal seemed attractive to him. After studying the proposal, Basco sent his plan to establish a large-scale tobacco production in the colony under complete ownership and management by the colonial government of Spain. What probably perked up the ears of the Spanish king about Basco&#x27;s plan to make the Philippine colony financially self-sufficient, thus removing a huge financial burden from the Spanish crown. The King of Spain issued a royal decree on February 9, 1780, setting in motion Basco&#x27;s plan.

Almost two years to the date of that royal decree, Basco ordered local officials and military commanders to prevent unnecessary losses of tobacco revenues. By March 2, 1782, tobacco production was established in Luzon, with La Union, Ilocos, Abra, Cagayan Valley and Nueva Ecija (still part of Pampanga at the time) as the centers for planting, growing, harvesting and processing tobacco.

This made a drastic and extreme change in the lives of all Novo Ecijanos. Where farmland used to bear rice, tobacco was now the only crop allowed to grow. These included the towns of Gapan, San Isidro, Jaen, Cabiao, Cabanatuan, Talavera, Santor and Bongabon. Each farming family was given a quota of tobacco plant to grow.

By 1850 the tobacco monopoly was producing immense financial gain for the colonial government. Some reports at the time pegged the earnings by as much as $500,000. One account in 1866 reported a much higher amount, as earnings rose to $38,418,939 that year.

Novo Ecijanos suffered a lot from the system. Nueva Ecija was more often able to meet production quotas compared to the other districts. Despite this, tobacco policy imposed a lower price on tobacco from areas closer to Manila. That meant that first-class tobacco leaf grown and harvested from Nueva Ecija was priced lower by one dollar, compared to those from Ilocos, La Union and Cagayan Valley.

The tobacco monopoly did not spur Novo Ecijanos to revolt, unlike the Ilocanos who staged an uprising over injustices in the system. Some tobacco growers in Nueva Ecija resorted to smuggling their own harvests in order to get some profit. But getting caught entailed harsher fines and penalties. Even sympathetic local officials had no choice but to enforce the unjust policies under pain of arrest and hard labor, once laxity on their part resulted in low production.

The flourishing tobacco industry coupled with the rich agricultural lands in central and northeastern Nueva Ecija also attracted migrants from neighboring Pampanga, Pangasinan, Ilocos and Tagalog areas. This made Nueva Ecija a melting pot of cultures and influences, the results of which are still evident in present-day Novo Ecijano culture.

As the tobacco monopoly fuelled further unrest, Spain finally abolished the monopoly on December 3, 1882. It was only then that they could all once again grow rice for food.

====Philippine revolution====

One distinct feature of the 1896 revolution against Spain in Nueva Ecija was that it was led by the elite, ruling class instead of the masses. Leaders of the revolt in Nueva Ecija were municipal officials and prominent citizens, who refused to collaborate with the Spanish authorities when armed struggle broke out. Despite being in the ruling class and enjoying positions in the colonial government, these prominent Novo Ecijanos proved their patriotism and love for fellow Filipinos.
In fact, one of the founding members of the reform movement La Liga Filipina was lawyer and Novo Ecijano Mamerto Natividad. By the time the Katipunan, the revolutionary movement against Spain, was formed, Novo Ecijanos were actively yet secretly joining it. Even local officials in Nueva Ecija secretly allied with the illustrados and farmers in forming the underground revolutionary society.

Once the Spanish authorities learned of the Katipunan&#x27;s existence, those perceived as sympathizers of the movement, and even those who were falsely accused of being members of it, were arrested. Mamerto Natividad was among those arrested for sedition, tortured and killed by guardia civil. He was one of the first Novo Ecijano martyrs for freedom. His death, however, would result in bigger problems for the Spanish authorities.

Mamerto Natividad&#x27;s two sons, Mamerto Jr. and Benito Natividad, later joined the Katipunan. The Spaniards burned their house and sugar mills in Jaen. Mamerto Jr. was later jailed for shooting a Spanish judge who had slapped his younger brother. As the Revolution gained ground, Mamerto Jr. was released and he was able to join the revolutionary army of General Emilio Aguinaldo in Cavite. By August 30, 1896, a state of war was declared by the Spanish colonial government in several Luzon provinces including Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Tarlac, Batangas, Laguna, Cavite and Manila.

Novo Ecijanos immediately proved themselves worthy of the fight for freedom. On September 2, 1896, Novo Ecijanos led by Gen. Mariano Llanera, &quot;capital municipal&quot; of Cabiao and Gen. Pantaleon Valmonte, &quot;capitan municipal&quot; of Gapan attacked San Isidro, the provincial capital. Their 3,000-strong army attacked San Isidro in distinct Novo Ecijano fashion: accompanied by music played by the Banda de Cabiao or Cabiao band.

Novo Ecijanos like Llanera, Valmonte, Mamerto Natividad Jr. and Manuel Tinio conducted themselves heroically during the revolution. They were allied with Aguinaldo&#x27;s Magdalo group. Aguinaldo was in fact so impressed, he appointed Natividad and Llanera to the two highest-ranking posts in the revolutionary army. Natividad became General Mamerto Natividad, commanding general of the revolutionary army, while General Llanera was vice-commander with the rank of Lieutenant-General. General Natividad proved himself worthy of the position by scoring victories against the Spanish in Tayug, Pangasinan and San Rafael, Bulacan.

On November 11, 1897, Natividad was killed in action in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. His death precipitated the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, a peace treaty that sought to end hostilities between Spanish authorities and the Filipino rebels. The treaty provided for a payment of P800,000 to the rebels who would then be exiled to Hong Kong. Five Novo Ecijanos would accompany Aguinaldo&#x27;s exile. They were General Mariano Llanera, Benito Natividad, General Manuel Tinio, and Joaquin Natividad.

Later on, Novo Ecijanos would continue to participate in the drama of war, revolution and the fight for freedom. They would fight when the revolt against Spain continued after the peace treaty broke down and the United States, after declaring war on Spain, promised to help Filipinos fight for freedom. Then, Novo Ecijanos again joined General Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippine–American War (after it became evident the United States wanted to make the Philippines their own colony).

=====Cry of Nueva Ecija=====

The &quot;Cry of Nueva Ecija&quot; is the 1896 revolutionary battle led by General Mariano Llanera, manned and assisted by General Manuel Tinio and Pantaleon Valmonte of Gapan, Nueva Ecija and Colonel Alipio Tecson of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija who later on became Brigadaire General. The battle was fought in Cabiao, Nueva Ecija. Alipio Tecson would eventually become &quot;Gobernadorcillo&quot; of Cabiao, Nueva Ecija.

===American colonial era===
History records how the Philippine–American War began after American troops killed a Filipino soldier who was crossing the San Juan bridge on February 4, 1899. One could also say, however, that hostilities and mistrust really began as early as August 13 the previous year. On that day, the Spanish colonial government in Intramuros surrendered to American forces instead of the Filipino soldiers that surrounded the Walled City. Thus began the United States own effort to have her own colonies, with the Philippines served, as it were, on a silver platter by the dying Spanish Empire thanks to the Treaty of Paris.

When the war between Filipinos and Americans finally began, the fate of the infant Republic of the Philippines again lay in the hands of General Aguinaldo and his most trusted men who included Novo Ecijanos like General Llanera and General Tinio. And, as guerilla warfare became an effective tactic for the Filipinos, Novo Ecijanos were among the most feared guerillas. By the time the war ended on April 1, 1901, with Aguinaldo&#x27;s surrender to the Americans, Novo Ecijano guerillas who had fought so fiercely and bravely against two sets of foreign invaders reluctantly gave up. Still that was not the end of the association between them and the Americans. The end of the Philippine–American War also signaled a new beginning for Nueva Ecija and its people.

====The railway====
Commercial, interprovincial trade was carried out using the Rio Grande de Pampanga as main waterway, with trade outposts in San Isidro and Talipapa. Traders from Bulacan, Tondo and Manila regularly came to Nueva Ecija to carry back rice, palay, tobacco, sugar, corn and livestock.

Americans, however, wanted to shift from water-borne trade to a land-based trade system. Their idea for establishing this depended on something they were masters at: building railways. The American colonial government thought a railway could help boost Nueva Ecija&#x27;s economic growth, in the same way that the US railway system helped unite and develop the economy of the North American continent. What made the railway project attractive was that it was less expensive than building roads. At first run by a private company, the US colonial government took over the ownership and management of the railway system by 1917.

The Americans were soon proven right: trade conducted through the railways boosted Nueva Ecija&#x27;s income by 25% while transport costs went down by 25% to as much as 75%. With the train able to transport more goods and more people at a cheaper rate, the railway helped spark a rice boom in Gapan, San Isidro, Cabanatuan, Santa Rosa and Penaranda. Farmers could devote more land to growing rice and even secondary crops like onions and watermelons.
More rice mills, farmers and farmer settlers came to Nueva Ecija. By 1936, there were 42 rice mills in Nueva Ecija, owned mostly by Chinese.

The agriculture-based economic boom brought about by the train&#x27;s huge load capacity and greater speed (compared to boats) encouraged waves of migrations to Nueva Ecija from places like Ilocos, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Tarlac and Bulacan.

The railway brought other changes to Nueva Ecija. While trade was still being done by waterways, settlements by necessity had to be established close to the rivers, where people&#x27;s basic necessities came from. When the trains became the main mode of transporting goods and people, and with the influx of migrants, it became not only possible but crucial to build more communities further inland. This meant roads and irrigation systems were needed.

====Roads and irrigation====
As communities expanded inward, first along the rivers and then along the railways, the need for roads and irrigation systems leading to communities in the plains became more urgent. These made it possible for the more remote towns—those farther away from both rivers and railroads—to grow crops and participate in trade, ending what was until then a very slow pace of economic development. By 1912 Governor Benito Natividad had appropriated funds to fast-track the building of roads and bridges linking these remote towns and municipalities to then provincial capital Cabanatuan.

The American government also constructed three major irrigation facilities: 1) The Talavera Irrigation System in 1924; 2) Penaranda River Irrigation System in 1930 and 3) Pampanga River Irrigation System in 1939.

By the time these irrigation systems went in full swing, combined with the railway system and the many rice mills, Nueva Ecija had been established as the &quot;Rice Granary of the Philippines&quot;. From 1930 to 1939, rice production in Nueva Ecija was averaging more than 9 million cavans of rice.

====Homesteading and US-style tenancy====
Unlike the American pioneers of the Old West, Filipinos were not so willing to occupy remote, unsettled and undeveloped areas. So when the American colonial government introduced homesteading, there were few takers among Filipinos. Homesteading could be done through a legal process of acquiring a land title, or even without a title at all. In the latter case however, the lack of a title makes the informal homesteader vulnerable to any legal action attempting to take the land away from him.

When the Philippine Bill of 1902 was passed by the US Congress, the US colonial government was formally established in the Philippine islands. This meant the colonial government now had the authority to dispose of public lands on its own, without having to seek the approval of the President of the United States. Based on an earlier survey of public lands by the Philippine Commission, the new American colonial government offered public lands to settlers through homesteading, sale, purchase or lease.

Under the American regime&#x27;s homesteading system, an individual could get up to 16 hectares of land, while a corporation could get as much as 1,024 hectares. This did not result in a wide settlement of lands throughout the country, however. Nueva Ecija was one exception, as more settlers opted to homestead its lands. A 1928 Statistical Bulletin records nearly 70,000 hectares were given to more than five thousand homestead applicants.

The homesteading efforts under the American regime ultimately failed in succeeding decades due to two major factors. First, the new farmer-settlers did not have enough capital to sustain farming costs. Without any financial assistance available from the government that granted them the land, farmer-settlers accumulated huge debts at very high interest rates from usurious moneylenders. Most of these homesteaders were later forced to sell their land and become tenant farmers instead.

====Civil government in the American period====
The civil governments established in various provinces in the Philippines under the American Occupation were supposed to teach Filipinos the basic principles of democracy, following US military rule. In general, each provincial government presided over local governments in each town or municipality. In turn, each municipality would have a president, vice-president and municipal councillors. These were elected by a select group of qualified electors for two-year terms.

The second Philippine Commission went to what was then Nueva&#x27;s provincial capital, San Isidro, on June 8, 1901, to begin proceedings for establishing the local and provincial governments. 16 out of Nueva Ecija&#x27;s 19 towns were represented in the meeting. Elections of various representatives from the different towns were carried out successfully.

However, there was still the thorny problem of deciding whether or not to move the provincial capital. The dilemma was caused by events related to the Philippine–American War. First, Nueva Ecija had been a hotbed of resistance against the American Occupation, and was therefore in a state of siege. Four of its towns, Balungao, Rosales, San Quintin and Umingan, which were further away from the capital and already considered pacified by US forces, had been annexed to the province of Pangasinan. In 1902, the District of El Príncipe (composed only of Baler and Casiguran at that time, and now also composed of Dinalungan, Dingalan, Dipaculao, Maria Aurora, and San Luis) was separated from Nueva Ecija &amp; annexed to Tayabas (now Quezon), which then became part of Aurora.

The newly elected Nueva Ecija representatives were of the view that since a civil government under the Americans was already being established, it was time to return the four towns to Nueva Ecija. This would benefit the province as the four town were rich in natural resources. The fact that the towns were quite far from the capital, one of the representatives suggested, was no obstacle: the provincial capital could simply be moved to Cabanatuan. Other representatives objected to this proposal, pointing out that Cabanatuan had no infrastructures wherein to house the provincial government. The matter was not resolved until two years later, when the US governor-general signed Act No. 1748, ordering the transfer of the capital to Cabanatuan by 1912.

The civil provincial government of Nueva Ecija was formally established by the Taft Commission on June 11, 1901. The very first governor under this new system was Epifanio de los Santos. The main artery connecting most of Metro Manila, EDSA, is named for Governor de los Santos.

====Education during the American period====
Americans succeeded in making education widely available to Filipinos. While the Spanish government did, rather belatedly in their rule (in the middle of the 19th century), decide to establish public schools, it was the Americans who were able to improve it.

A report of the United States&#x27; Philippine Commission in 1900 showed, only 10 out of 23 municipalities in Nueva Ecija had a public school established during the Spanish times and according to the Philippine Commission figures by 1902, 37 public primary schools were established, and 63 Novo Ecijano teachers supported by 16 American &quot;Thomasites&quot;, part of the larger group of some 500 pioneer American teachers who arrived aboard the in September 1901, to help establish an American public school system in the Philippines. The Education Act No. 74 approved by the Philippine Commission in 1901 proved to be the catalyst that made Novo Ecijanos rally behind the local and American teachers to make sure as many children as possible benefitted from the public school system.

People contributed in the form of cash, construction materials or labor, and even vacant lots for the building of schools. Community support for the building of schools was such that by 1906, there were already 99 schools in Nueva Ecija. The public school system was still hampered by problems. Relying only on local support, Nueva Ecija (and other places in the Philippines as well) could simply not meet the increasing needs of a growing number of schools, teachers and students. Given the high premium placed by Novo Ecijanos on education, a legislator from Nueva Ecija took the crucial step to compel the American colonial government to allot funding for public education via a legislative act.

Assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon of Nueva Ecija filed an education bill before the 1907 Philippine Assembly, which would later be approved and known as the Gabaldon Education Act. The bill required government to earmark P1,000,000 for public schools throughout the Philippine islands.

Nueva Ecija benefitted tremendously from the new education law. By 1908 Nueva Ecija had 144 primary schools, 11 non-sectarian private schools, 18 sectarian private schools, nine intermediate schools, one vocational school and one agricultural school, the Central Luzon Agricultural School, which is currently now operating as Central Luzon State University.

===Japanese occupation===


When the Japanese tried to make the Philippines their own colony at the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific, Novo Ecijanos would also make history by participating in guerilla activities. The exploits of the Novo Ecijano guerillas have in fact been made into literature, through the World War II novel &quot;Ghost Soldiers&quot; by Hampton Sides and in Hollywood cinema, in the war film &quot;The Great Raid&quot; based on the book.

During World War II the Imperial Japanese Army entered the province and Nueva Ecija was taken in 1942. On March 29, 1942, under the leadership of Luis Taruc the Hukbalahap (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon-People&#x27;s Army Against the Japanese) was organized in Sitio Bawit, Barrio San Julian in the town of Cabiao. It was perceived to be the military arm of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas (Communist Party of the Philippines), that brought about the beginning of the early organized resistance of the Filipino people.

During World War II under the Japanese occupation, The Philippine Commonwealth Army has the re-establishment of the Military General Headquarters, Military Bases and Camps here in the province of Nueva Ecija on January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, before the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial Military Operations in Central Luzon include Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zambales, Bulacan and Northern Tayabas (now Aurora) from 1942 to 1945 and aided the local recognized guerrillas and the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas against the Japanese Imperial forces since the Japanese Counter-Insurgencies (1942–1944) and the Allied Liberation (1944–1945). In 1942, the entire present-day territory of Aurora was re-annexed from Tayabas to Nueva Ecija, and returned to Tayabas in 1945

In January to August 1945, combined American and Filipino soldiers liberated Nueva Ecija with the recognized guerrillas continuing to harass the Japanese at every opportunity. When Filipino soldiers of the 2nd, 22nd, 23rd, 25th and 26th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the 2nd Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was re-invading launches to entering liberated the province of Nueva Ecija and helping recognized guerrilla resistance fighter units, the Hukbalahap Communist guerrillas and the American troops against the Japanese Imperial forces during the Invasion of Nueva Ecija.

On January 30, 1945, American Army Rangers, Alamo scouts and Filipino guerrillas conducted a raid to liberate Allied civilians and prisoners of war in Cabanatuan, this was successful with over 516 rescued. By January 31, 1945, the liberated civilians and POWs reached Talavera.

===Post-independence era===
After the war, much rebuilding was made at the urban areas of the province, specifically Cabanatuan and Gapan. This became the focus of the administrations of Quezon, Roxas, Quirino, Magsaysay, Garcia, and Macapagal. The city of Palayan was formally established by law and became the new capital of the province.

===Marcos dictatorship===
Much of the rebuilding and establishment of economic centers in the province spiraled down due to the declaration of martial law by Marcos, which also resulted to the Talugtug massacre, where commonfolk Ilocanos were gathered and killed by the Marcos-controlled military, and the Gapan massacre, where the military killed-off a whole family, including children.

A number of Novo Ecijanos played an important role in resisting the excesses and abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, and were later honored by having their name inscribed on the Wall of Remembrance at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani (lit. Monument of Heroes). This included Catholic Priest Pepito Bernardo, Human Rights Lawywer Sedfrey Ordoñez, and activists Fortunato &quot;Toto&quot; Camus, Edgar Cupino, Manuel &quot;Sonny&quot; Hizon, Emmanuel Lazo, and Evelyn Pacheco-Mangulabnan, among others.

In 1986, Novo Ecijanos participated in the nationwide EDSA People Power Revolution, effectively ousting Marcos from power and restoring Philippine democracy. The revolution was named after Novo Ecijano revolutionary Epifanio De los Santos, who was a hero during the war against Spain.

===Post-EDSA era===
Repairing the severely-damaged economy was spearheaded by the Cory Aquino government, which also introduced a new Constitution and a game-changing economic reform policy, which resulted to the country&#x27;s economic resiliency in the 21st century. The Ramos government continued Aquino&#x27;s reforms, greatly affecting all provinces in the country.

In 1987, Nueva Ecija&#x27;s fourth district representative Nicanor de Guzman Jr. attempted to bribe Potenciano &quot;Chito&quot; Roque, then the head of the Task Force on Anti-Gambling (TFAG), with allowing Bong Pineda to operate jueteng, an illegal numbers game, in his district in the province during a meeting in Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila.

===Contemporary===
The Estrada government was ousted due to illegal activities, leading to the installment of the Arroyo government. The Noynoy Aquino government established one of the province&#x27;s most largest and expansive irrigation system for the benefit of farmers. During this time, the national economy enlarged exponentially, becoming one of the fastest-growing in the region. The Duterte government accession made wary ups and downs in the provincial economy.

==Geography==
The province is the largest in Central Luzon, covering a total area of . Its terrain begins with the southwestern marshes near the Pampanga border.

As a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion, and commercial relationships.

Filipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group.[496] The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of &quot;Hiya&quot;, roughly translated as &#x27;a sense of shame&#x27;, and &quot;Amor propio&quot; or &#x27;self-esteem&#x27;.[496] Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.

Other elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.

But unlike the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas, Lazaro advocated for the peaceful resolution of the agrarian problem, relying on the benevolence of the government and the landlords.

<text>Hollywood and Vine, the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood, California, became known in the 1920s for its concentration of radio and movie-related businesses. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is centered on the intersection.

==History==
The area was a lemon grove until 1903, when Daeida Beveridge allowed one corner of the dirt intersection on her property to be used for the Hollywood Memorial Church. The streets were renamed in 1910, when the city of Hollywood was annexed into Los Angeles.

Beginning in the 1920s, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the area began to see an influx of money and influence as movie and music businesses moved to the district, turning the local farms and orchards into movie backlots. Hollywood and Vine was the second busiest intersection in the city, after Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue.

In the 1930s, radio station KFWB spoke of &quot;broadcasting live from Hollywood and Vine,&quot; and newspaper columnists Hedda Hopper and Jimmie Fidler regularly touted the intersection&#x27;s mystique.

In 1958, the intersection became the crossing point of the newly installed t-shaped Hollywood Walk of Fame. Later Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, the astronauts of the first lunar landing mission Apollo 11, were awarded television stars for coverage of the mission, and given the places of honor at all four corners of Hollywood and Vine.

By the 1960s, however, many studios and broadcasters had moved onto more upscale areas, and the area fell into disrepair and disrepute, with many abandoned stores and offices, and the streets themselves, claimed by squatters and panhandlers. It took several decades for redevelopment to take hold, and visitors looking for Hollywood dreams were often taken aback by the area&#x27;s contrast with shinier tourist meccas.

The Hollywood/Vine subway station opened in 1999, and led to more sustained and serious redevelopment in the area. On May 29, 2003, Hollywood and Vine was named &quot;Bob Hope Square&quot; to commemorate Hope&#x27;s 100th birthday.

In urban folklore, many of the local buildings are considered to be part of &quot;Haunted Hollywood&quot;, home to the ghosts of celebrities (and less stellar residents) of Hollywood&#x27;s legendary past. The intersection has been mentioned or alluded to in dozens of songs, films, video games, music videos and other popular media, often as a symbol of Hollywood&#x27;s lure as a destination for dreamers, or for its decadence and disappointments.

===Historic buildings===
Hollywood and Vine&#x27;s first building, located on the intersection&#x27;s southeast corner, was the Hollywood Memorial Church, constructed in 1903. It was later torn down to make way for the intersection&#x27;s first high rise, the 12-story Taft Building, built in 1923. The Taft Building was built in the Renaissance Revival style for A.Z. Taft Jr. by Walker &amp; Eisen. In Hollywood&#x27;s golden age, every studio as well as Charlie Chaplin, Will Rogers, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences had offices in the building. To the south of the Taft Building is the Spanish Colonial Revival Herman Building and south of that was the complementary-designed Hollywood Brown Derby, the latter of which was demolished in 1994. To the east of the Taft Building was the Châteauesque Gilbert Books Building, which was demolished to make way for the W Hollywood Hotel and Residences.

On the northeast corner, the Equitable Building of Hollywood was designed by Aleck Curlett, built in 1929, and expanded in 1931. Originally home to numerous talent and advertising agencies, it was converted to a condominium in 2007. East of the Equitable Building is the Art Deco Hollywood Pantages Theatre, designed by B. Marcus Priteca and built as a movie palace in 1930, then converted to a live theater in the 1977. North of the Equitable Building is the Welton Becket designed, Googie-styled Capitol Records Building. Built in 1956, the Capitol Records Building is the world&#x27;s first circular office building and was home to the first record label location on the west coast of the United States.

On the northwest corner, the Laemmle Building was built in 1932 by Richard Neutra for Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Pictures. The original design was not built because of the 1929 stock market crash, and the building was significantly altered many times. The building was gutted by fire in April 2008 and razed six months later. To the west of the former Laemmle Building is the former site of Sardi&#x27;s Diner and is now home to the Cave Theater. West of that is the Vine Theatre. To the north of the former Laemmle Building is a Spanish Colonial style Hollywood Playhouse, opened on January 24, 1927, designed by H. L. Gogerty and Carl Jules Weyl. The building&#x27;s name has changed many times over the 20th century, but was known as the Hollywood Palace for many years before its most recent renaming.

On the southwest corner, the Dyas Building was built in 1927 by Frederick Rice Dorn. From 1931 to 1982, the building housed The Broadway-Hollywood department store, and in 2007, the building converted to multi-family residential, ground-floor commercial. The Dyas Building has two annexes, one to the south of the building and the other to the west, that were built in the late 1930s. South of the building is the Hollywood Plaza Hotel, built by Walker &amp; Eisen in 1924 and at one point home to silent film star Clara Bow&#x27;s &quot;It Cafe&quot;.

Six of the aforementioned buildings are listed as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments:
* Hollywood Pantages Theatre (#193)
* Broadway Hollywood Building (#664)
* Hollywood Plaza Hotel (#665)
* Taft Building (#666)
* Capitol Records Building (#857)
* Equitable Building (#1088)

Furthermore, nine of the aforementioned buildings are listed as contributing properties in the National Register of Historic Places Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District:
* Hollywood Pantages Theatre
* Broadway Hollywood Building
* Hollywood Plaza Hotel
* Taft Building
* Equitable Building
* Hollywood Playhouse
* Herman Building
* Gilbert Books
* Hollywood Brown Derby

== Redevelopment and urbanization ==
A number of high-profile projects have attempted to restore the lost luster of the area, most notably the $600 million W Hollywood Hotel and Residences, which opened in 2010. Other large projects include a $50-million conversion of the Equitable Building and $70-million conversion of the Dyas Building into condominiums.

<text>Francis Turner Palgrave (; 28 September 1824 – 24 October 1897) was a British critic, anthologist and poet.

==Life==
He was born at Great Yarmouth, the eldest son of Sir Francis Palgrave, the (born Jewish) historian to his wife Elizabeth, daughter of the banker Dawson Turner. His brothers were William Gifford Palgrave, Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave and Reginald Palgrave. His childhood was spent at Yarmouth and at his father&#x27;s house in Hampstead. At fourteen he was sent as a day-boy to Charterhouse; and in 1843, having in the meanwhile travelled extensively in Italy and other parts of the continent, he won a scholarship at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1846 he interrupted his university career to serve as assistant private secretary to Gladstone, but returned, to Oxford the next year, and took a first class in Literae Humaniores. From 1847 to 1862 he was fellow of Exeter College, and in 1849 entered the Education Department at Whitehall.

In 1850 Palgrave accepted the vice-principalship of Kneller Hall Training College at Twickenham. The Principal of the College was Frederick Temple, a friend from his Oxford days. There he also came into contact with Alfred Tennyson, with whom he laid the foundation of another lifelong friendship. When the training college was abandoned, Palgrave returned to Whitehall in 1855, becoming examiner in the Education Department, and eventually assistant secretary.

He lived at the Hampstead home with his widowed father until on 30 December 1862, he married Cecil Grenville Milnes, daughter of James Milnes-Gaskell, MP for Much Wenlock and a friend of Gladstone. Temple, the Gladstones, who invited the couple to Hawarden Castle, and Tennyson were among the liberal-minded guests who attended the wedding. When they visited Hawarden again, her father had died, and Gladstone lost a good friend, for Cis accompanied her husband everywhere; to Aldworth and Farringford, Tennyson&#x27;s houses, and to the Grosvenor family at the Duke of Westminster&#x27;s house. Yet one of his greatest friends was Charles Alderson, with whose family he travelled to Grenoble, and whose familial Norfolk connections included the aesthete and doyenne, Lady Eastlake. Palgrave&#x27;s flirtation with Liberalism came to an abrupt halt, when in 1885, he diverged with Gladstone over the Home Rule debate. While they lived at 5 York Gate, a mansion located in Regents Park, they took a holiday home, called Little Park, in &#x27;Royalist&#x27; Lyme Regis, with a more Conservative inference; it belonged to his parents. Throughout 1870s the Palgraves paid repeated visits and stays at Hatfield House, the home of the future Conservative Prime Minister, Lord and Lady Salisbury. He was hugely impressed by the artistic beauty of the mansion, its &quot;objets d&#x27;arts&quot;, fine art, and furniture being of national significance.

Palgrave continued to work in the Privy Council&#x27;s Education Department until he resigned his position in 1884, and in the following year succeeded John Campbell Shairp as professor of poetry at Oxford. For many years F. T. Palgrave remained the art critic for the popular &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. There was a minor scandal when he was commissioned to write a catalogue for the 1862 International Exhibition, in which he praised his friend the sculptor Thomas Woolner while simultaneously denigrating others, especially Woolner&#x27;s main rival Carlo Marochetti. The well known controversialist Jacob Omnium pointed out in a series of letters to the press that the two lived together. William Holman Hunt wrote a reply supporting Palgrave and Woolner, but Palgrave was forced to withdraw the catalogue. He died in London, and was buried in the cemetery on Barnes Common.

His only child, Gwenllian Florence Palgrave (1867-1941), published a biography of her father&#x27;s life in 1899.

==Poet/critic==
Palgrave published both criticism and poetry, but his work as a critic was by far the more important. His &quot;Visions of England&quot; (1880–1881) has dignity and lucidity, but little of the &quot;natural magic&quot; which the greatest of his predecessors in the Oxford chair considered to be the test of inspiration. His last volume of poetry, &quot;Amenophis&quot;, appeared in 1892. His criticism is considered to demonstrate fine and sensitive tact, quick intuitive perception, and generally sound judgment. His &quot;Descriptive Handbook to the Fine Art Collections in the International Exhibition of 1862&quot;, and his &quot;Essays on Art&quot; (1866), though flawed, were full of striking judgments strikingly expressed. Nonetheless the critic John Ruskin wrote in 1855 on his &quot;History of Painting&quot;, &quot;I think it is a most valuable contribution.&quot; Palgrave was immediately encouraged to write &quot;History of Engraving&quot; which was completed in quick time, and hailed as a masterpiece.

His &quot;Landscape in Poetry&quot; (1897) showed wide knowledge and critical appreciation of one of the most attractive aspects of poetic interpretation. But Palgrave&#x27;s principal contribution to the development of literary taste was contained in his &quot;Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics&quot; (1861), an anthology of the best poetry in the language constructed upon a plan sound and spacious, and followed out with a delicacy of feeling which could scarcely be surpassed. Palgrave followed it with a &quot;Treasury of Sacred Song&quot; (1889), and a second series of the &quot;Golden Treasury&quot; (1897), including the work of later poets, but in neither of these was quite the same exquisiteness of judgment preserved. Among his other works were &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; (1858), a volume of selections from Robert Herrick entitled &quot;Chrysomela&quot; (1877), a memoir of Arthur Hugh Clough (1862) and a critical essay on Sir Walter Scott (1866) as a preface to an edition of his poems. He published a small collection of hymns in 1867 which ran to three editions, each slightly enlarged. Palgrave was also a hymn-writer using the words, on one occasion, the Elizabethan version of 120th Psalm &quot;O Thou not made with hands&quot; into a hymn. The highly poetical &quot;Little Child&#x27;s Hymn&quot; held great sentimental meaning for his daughter and biographer Gwenllian.

The album was recorded on November 23, 1996, at Cobo Arena in Detroit, Michigan, during the band&#x27;s North American tour in support of &quot;Trouble at the Henhouse&quot;.

Lead singer Gordon Downie was known for his intensity and spontaneity during the band&#x27;s live concerts such as telling rants/stories, observations, and random comments before, during, and after songs, among other things. As such, this live recording documents him incorporating snippets of other songs in the middle of the band&#x27;s own songs. This includes John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; during &quot;Grace, Too&quot;, Crowded House&#x27;s &quot;Into Temptation&quot; during &quot;Twist My Arm&quot;, David Bowie/Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;China Girl&quot; and The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot; during &quot;New Orleans Is Sinking&quot;, and both Jane Siberry&#x27;s &quot;The Temple&quot; and Rheostatics&#x27; &quot;Bad Time to Be Poor&quot; during &quot;Nautical Disaster&quot;; in addition, a lyrical snippet from Downie&#x27;s own solo song &quot;Every Irrelevance&quot; is spoken as the introduction to &quot;Ahead by a Century&quot;, and part of the band&#x27;s own unreleased but widely bootlegged song &quot;Montreal&quot; appears in &quot;Courage&quot;.

Rheostatics were the opening act on the tour as documented by this album&#x27;s liner notes, and announced by Downie during the fade-in at the beginning of the album&#x27;s first track.

In the week of the album&#x27;s release, eight songs from the album appeared in the week&#x27;s Top 20 singles chart.

The title comes from graffiti in Kingston, Ontario, which read &quot;The Hip live between us.&quot; This graffiti was penned by early band member Davis Manning, describing the impact that the band was having on his relationship with his girlfriend. The mural remained on the wall until the mid-2000s when it was painted over by the property owner. However, it is immortalized on the CD graphic.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Live Between Us&quot; sold 35,000 units in its first two days and debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart on the strength of the first two days&#x27; sales. The album was certified double platinum on August 19, 1997. The album sold 400,000 units by the end of 1997. Between 1996 and 2016, &quot;Live Between Us&quot; was the best-selling live album by a Canadian band in Canada and the third best-selling live album by a Canadian artist overall in Canada. In Flanders, &quot;Live Between Us&quot; debuted at #47.

<doc id="255657" wikidata="Q284209" url="?curid=255657" title="Phenacyl chloride">
<text>Phenacyl chloride, also commonly known as chloroacetophenone, is a substituted acetophenone. It is a useful building block in organic chemistry. Apart from that, it has been historically used as a riot control agent, where it is designated CN.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1046/j.1365-2133.1999.02724.x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be confused with cyanide, another agent used in chemical warfare, which has the chemical structure CN−. Chloroacetophenone is thermally stable, and is the only tear agent that is distillable at ambient conditions.

==Preparation==
Chloroacetophenone was first synthetized by Carl Graebe in 1871 by passing chlorine into boiling acetophenone.

Phenacyl chloride is readily available and was first prepared by chlorination of acetophenone vapour. It may also be synthesized by the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene using chloroacetyl chloride, with an aluminium chloride catalyst:

==Riot control agent==
It was investigated, but not used, during the First and Second World Wars (it was used as a &quot;green agent&quot; by the former Japanese military during the Sino-Japanese War).

Because of CN&#x27;s significantly greater toxicity, CN has largely been supplanted for military use by CS gas. Even though CN is still supplied to paramilitary and police forces in a small pressurized aerosol known as “Mace” or tear gas, CN&#x27;s use is falling because pepper spray both works and disperses more quickly than CN and is less toxic than CN.

The term &quot;Mace&quot; came into being because it was the brand-name invented by one of the first American manufacturers of CN aerosol sprays. Subsequently, in the United States, Mace became synonymous with tear-gas sprays in the same way that Kleenex has become strongly associated with facial tissues (a phenomenon known as a genericized trademark).

Like CS gas, this compound irritates the mucous membranes (oral, nasal, conjunctival and tracheobronchial). Sometimes it can give rise to more generalized reactions such as syncope, temporary loss of balance and orientation. More rarely, cutaneous irritating outbreaks have been observed and allergic contact permanent dermatitis.

At high concentrations, CN may cause corneal epithelial damage and chemosis. It has also accounted for at least five deaths, which have resulted from pulmonary injury and/or asphyxia.

TRPA1 (Transient Receptor Potential-Ankyrin 1) ion channel expressed on nociceptors (especially trigeminal) has been implicated as the site of action for CN, in vivo and in vitro.

<text>John Campbell Shairp (30 July 1819 – 18 September 1885) was a Scottish critic and man of letters.

==Life==
He was born at Houstoun House, Linlithgowshire, the third son of Major Norman Shairp of Houstoun, and was educated at Edinburgh Academy and the University of Glasgow.

Shairp gained a Snell exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford in 1840. In 1842 he won the Newdigate prize for a poem on Charles XII of Sweden, and took his degree in 1844. During these years the &quot;Oxford Movement&quot; was at its height. Shairp was stirred by John Henry Newman&#x27;s sermons, and admired the poetry of John Keble, on whose character and work he wrote an essay; but he remained faithful to his Presbyterian upbringing. After leaving Oxford he took a mastership at Rugby School under Archibald Campbell Tait.

In 1857 Shairp became assistant to the professor of humanity in the University of St Andrews, and in 1861 he was appointed to that chair. In 1868 he was presented to the principalship of the United College, St Andrews, and lectured from time to time on literary and ethical subjects. In 1877 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford in succession to Francis Hastings Doyle. He was re-elected to the chair of poetry in 1882, and discharged his duties there and at St Andrews until the end of 1884. He was a friend and correspondent of the Scottish poet and composer, Mary Maxwell Campbell, who lived at St Andrews.

Shairp died at Ormsary, Argyllshire.

==Works==
In 1864 Shairp published &quot;Kilmahoe, a Highland Pastoral&quot;, and in 1868 he republished some articles under the name of &quot;Studies in Poetry and Philosophy&quot;. A course of lectures was published in 1870 as &quot;Culture and Religion&quot;. In 1873 Shairp helped to edit the life of his predecessor James David Forbes, and in 1874 he edited Dorothy Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Recollections of a Tour in Scotland&quot;.

In 1877 Shairp published &quot;The Poetic Interpretation of Nature&quot;, in which he discussed science and poetry, and Hebrew, classical and English poets. In 1879 he contributed a life of Robert Burns to the &quot;English Men of Letters&quot; series. Lectures from his Oxford Professorship were published in 1881 as &quot;Aspects of Poetry&quot;. In 1888 appeared &quot;Glen Desseray, and other Poems&quot;, edited by Francis Turner Palgrave.

<doc id="255665" wikidata="Q233809" url="?curid=255665" title="Isabella II of Jerusalem">
<text>Isabella II (12124 May 1228), sometimes erroneously called Yolanda, was Queen of Jerusalem from 1212 to 1228. She was the daughter of Queen Maria of Jerusalem and her husband, John of Brienne. By marriage to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Isabella also became Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Sicily and Germany.

==Infant Queen==
Isabella II was born in Andria, in the southern Italian Kingdom of Sicily. She was the only child of Maria of Montferrat, Queen of Jerusalem, and John of Brienne. Maria was the daughter of Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem by her second husband Conrad I, and heiress, on her mother&#x27;s death, of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Maria died shortly after giving birth to Isabella II in 1212, possibly by puerperal fever. Because of this, Isabella II was proclaimed Queen of Jerusalem when she was only a few days old. Because her father John did not have a direct claim on the throne, he ruled as regent.

==Marriage with Frederick II==

During a meeting between John of Brienne, Pope Honorius III and Frederick II in the city of Ferentino in 1223, Isabella&#x27;s fate was decided: Frederick accepted to finally go to the Crusade, but only as the legitimate King of Jerusalem, and this was only possible if he agreed to take the young Queen Isabella II as his wife (by this time, Frederick was a widower). This was planned by the Pope, who hoped by this bond to attach the Emperor firmly to the Sixth Crusade. The betrothal was confirmed, but the Emperor still delayed his departure until August 1225, when he and Isabella were married by proxy in the City of Acre. Days later, Isabella II was crowned as Queen of Jerusalem.

Isabella arrived in Italy with twenty galleys sent by Frederick II to bring her to her father and married in person to Frederick II in the cathedral of Brindisi, on 9 November 1225. During the ceremony, Frederick declared himself King of Jerusalem and immediately saw to it that his new father-in-law John of Brienne, the current regent of Jerusalem, was dispossessed and his rights transferred to him. The contemporary chronicles described the exotic wedding celebrations, which took place in the Castle of Oria, and the indignant reaction of her father John of Brienne, now without royal authority.

==Death==
After the wedding, Isabella was kept in seclusion by her husband, in Palermo. Aged 14, in November 1226, she gave birth to her first child, a daughter (referred to by some sources as Margaret); the baby died in August 1227. On 25 April 1228 Isabella gave birth to her second child, a son, Conrad, in Andria, Bari, but a few days later, on 4 May, she died following childbirth complications. She was buried in the Andria Cathedral.

<text>Karnack is a rural unincorporated community in northeastern Harrison County near Caddo Lake in the eastern region of the U.S. state of Texas.

The town is named after Karnak, Egypt (near modern-day Luxor). It was thought that the community&#x27;s alignment with the city of Port Caddo was relative to that of Karnak and Thebes.

The Caddo Lake National Wildlife Refuge founded in 2000, formerly the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in operation there from 1942 to 1997, is located in Karnack.

==Geography==
Karnack is located in the pine woods of Northeast Texas and beside Caddo Lake, one of the largest natural lakes in the Southeast. The surrounding country is mostly farm and timber land. According to &quot;The Handbook of Texas&quot;, Caddo Lake was one of the largest natural lakes in Texas before the construction of Caddo Dam in 1900 made the lake even larger. It is often called Texas&#x27; only natural lake, but many small natural lakes and oxbow lakes are found in Texas.

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Karnack has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Education==
Karnack is served by the Karnack Independent School District. Karnack Elementary School and Karnack Junior/Senior High School serve the community.

Panola College is the assigned community college for the majority of Harrison County, Karnack included, according to the Texas Education Code.

== Notable person ==

* Lady Bird Johnson, former First Lady of the United States; was born and raised in Karnack.

<doc id="255669" wikidata="Q4745803" url="?curid=255669" title="Ameritech">
<text>AT&amp;T Teleholdings, Inc., formerly known as Ameritech Corporation (and, before that, American Information Technologies Corporation), was an American telecommunications company that arose out of the 1984 AT&amp;T divestiture. Ameritech was one of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies created following the breakup of the Bell System. Ameritech was acquired in 1999 by SBC Communications, which subsequently acquired AT&amp;T Corporation in 2006, becoming the present-day AT&amp;T.

==Overview==
Ameritech was created as a holding company that owned five former Bell System companies in the Midwest. Under its umbrella were:
* Illinois Bell Telephone Company
* Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Inc.
* Michigan Bell Telephone Company
* Ohio Bell Telephone Company
* Wisconsin Bell, Inc.

For Ameritech&#x27;s first nine years, it maintained these Bell brands inherited from the Bell System—though public displays of the Bell companies&#x27; names were often captioned &quot;An Ameritech Company&quot;. In January 1993, Ameritech officially retired the Bell brands and marketed itself with solely the Ameritech name across all five states in its territory. It added &quot;d/b/a Ameritech (state)&quot; to the names of its Bells to communicate brand unity.

Ameritech also owned Ameritech Cellular, a wireless company that operated cellular networks in many of the major cities of these states. Ameritech Cellular was previously called Ameritech Mobile Communications. Ameritech also provided cable television service in select areas as part of the Americast venture with other phone companies during the 1990s.

Ameritech Advanced Data Services (AADS) Network Access Point (NAP) was one of the original four National Science Foundation exchange points in the United States starting in 1994. AADS was a Tier 1 network Internet Exchange Point in Chicago, Illinois that provided service to higher education and research networks via a program called Star TAP and commercial networks. After the merger with SBC, AADS did business as the SBC Network Access Point or SBC/AADS NAP.

Prior to its merger with SBC Communications, Ameritech&#x27;s corporate headquarters were in a leased space above the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on floors 34 through 39 of 30 S Wacker Dr, Chicago. Further corporate offices were located at 225 W Randolph St, Chicago (formerly &quot;The Illinois Bell Building&quot;) and 2000 W. Ameritech Center Drive, Hoffman Estates) (&quot;The Ameritech Center&quot;). It was traded on the NYSE under the &quot;AIT&quot; symbol.

== Merger with SBC Communications ==

In May 1998, Ameritech announced its intent to merge with SBC Communications. This brought great concern to Federal and state regulators, who in turn did not approve the merger until SBC and Ameritech agreed to several conditions to ensure adequate competition. Most notably, regulators required:

* that the merged company offer local phone service in thirty markets outside of its home territory within thirty months of the merger (i.e. by April 2002) or pay a $1.18B penalty
* and that Ameritech Cellular assets in Chicago be sold to GTE. Since SBC already had a majority stake in a large mobile provider (Cellular One), the merged company, if it were to operate Ameritech Cellular and Cellular One both in the same market, would have wielded too much market power.

SBC and Ameritech officially merged on October 8, 1999. Prior to the merger, Ameritech&#x27;s Chairman and CEO was Richard Notebaert, who later (in 2002) became CEO of competitor Qwest.

=== The end of the Ameritech name ===

On January 15, 2003, SBC Communications changed its d.b.a. names, changed the legal name of Ameritech Corp. to SBC Teleholdings, Inc., which began doing business as SBC Midwest. On January 15, 2006, d.b.a names were again changed to align with SBC&#x27;s assumption of the AT&amp;T brand identity following its acquisition of AT&amp;T Corp. the previous year, and Ameritech was again renamed, becoming AT&amp;T Teleholdings, Inc. and began doing business as AT&amp;T Midwest.

Several Ameritech subsidiaries remain legally named &quot;Ameritech&quot;, such as Ameritech Advanced Services; however, they do business as &quot;AT&amp;T Advanced Solutions&quot;.

In 2006, the holding companies Pacific Telesis and Southern New England Telecommunications were legally merged into AT&amp;T Teleholdings. The company then became a holding company for Pacific Bell (and its subsidiary Nevada Bell) and Southern New England Telephone.

==In popular culture==

The Ameritech name was used in the storyline of the U.S. television miniseries &quot;Amerika&quot; to refer to one of the &quot;sovereign&quot; autonomous regions—Ameritech&#x27;s regional operating area, the Great Lakes area of North America—that the former United States was divided into in result of the fictional Soviet occupation that is the base premise of the miniseries&#x27; plot.

<text>James David Forbes (1809–1868) was a Scottish physicist and glaciologist who worked extensively on the conduction of heat and seismology. Forbes was a resident of Edinburgh for most of his life, educated at its University and a professor there from 1833 until he became principal of the United College of St Andrews in 1859.

== Life and work ==

Forbes was born on 20 April 1809 at 86 George Street in Edinburgh, the fourth son of Sir William Forbes, 7th Baronet, of Monymusk and Pitsligo (1773–1828) and Williamina Belches of Invermay. His brothers were the advocate and agriculturalist Sir John Stuart Hepburn Forbes of Fettercairn and Pitsligo and the banker Charles Forbes.

He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1825, and soon afterwards began to contribute papers to the &quot;Edinburgh Philosophical Journal&quot; anonymously under the signature &quot;Δ&quot;. At the age of nineteen he became a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in 1832 he was elected to the Royal Society of London. At this time he maintained correspondence with Sir David Brewster, who encouraged him to pursue an original research in science. A year later he was appointed professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in succession to Sir John Leslie, and during his tenure of that office, which he did not give up until 1860, he not only proved himself an active and efficient teacher, but also did much to improve the internal conditions of the university. In 1859 he was appointed successor to Brewster in the principalship of the United College of St Andrews, a position which he held until his death at Clifton in 1868.

As a scientific investigator he is best known for his researches on heat and on glaciers. Between 1836 and 1844 he published in the &quot;Trans. Roy. Soc. Ed.&quot; four series of &quot;Researches on Heat,&quot; in the course of which he demonstrated that tourmaline would polarise infrared thermal radiation, by transmission through a bundle of thin mica plates inclined to the transmitted ray, and by reflection from the multiplied surfaces of a pile of mica plates placed at the polarising angle, and also its circular polarisation by two internal reflections in rhombs of rock salt. His work won him the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society in 1838, and in 1843 he received its Royal Medal for a paper on the &quot;Transparency of the Atmosphere and the Laws of Extinction of the Sun&#x27;s Rays passing through it.&quot; He invented an inverted pendulum seismometer in 1842.

In response to a series of earthquakes near Comrie in Scotland in 1839, a committee was formed in the United Kingdom in order to produce better detection methods for earthquakes. The outcome of this was the production of one of the first modern seismometers by Forbes, first presented in a report by David Milne-Home in 1842. This seismometer was an inverted pendulum, which recorded the measurements of seismic activity through the use of a pencil placed on paper above the pendulum. The designs provided did not prove effective, according to Milne&#x27;s reports.

In 1846 he began experiments on the temperature of the earth at different depths and in different soils near Edinburgh, which yielded determinations of the thermal conductivity of trap-tufa, sandstone and pure loose sand. Towards the end of his life he was occupied with experimental inquiries into the laws of the conduction of heat in iron bars, and his last piece of work was to show that the thermal conductivity of iron diminishes with increase of temperature.

His attention was directed to the question of the flow of glaciers in 1840 when he met Louis Agassiz at the Glasgow meeting of the British Association, and in subsequent years he made several visits to Switzerland, where he was particularly impressed by Bernhard Studer&#x27;s theories, and also to Norway for the purpose of obtaining accurate data. His observations led him to the view that a glacier is an imperfect fluid or a viscous body which is urged down slopes of a certain inclination by the mutual pressure of its parts, and involved him in some controversy with Tyndall and others both as to priority and to scientific principle. A notable defender of Forbes in this controversy was John Ruskin, the two having first met by coincidence in 1844 during a study tour of the Alps.

During these expeditions, he made many measurements of the boiling point of water at various altitudes. This data set, published in 1857, is often known in statistics as &quot;Forbes&#x27;s data&quot;, its utility being that:
*It illustrates how a curvilinear relationship between a dependent and independent variable can be transformed into a linear model by knowledge of the physical phenomenon observed.
*It emphasises the importance of residuals analysis in linear regression as the residuals manifest an outlier that is not apparent in a visual inspection of the raw data.

Forbes was also interested in geology, and published memoirs on the thermal springs of the Pyrenees, on the extinct volcanoes of the Vivarais (Ardèche), on the geology of the Cuchullin and Eildon hills, etc. In addition to about 150 scientific papers, he wrote &quot;Travels through the Alps of Savoy and Other Parts of the Pennine Chain, with Observations on the Phenomena of Glaciers&quot; (1843); &quot;Norway and its Glaciers&quot; (1853); &quot;Occasional Papers on the Theory of Glaciers&quot; (1859); &quot;A Tour of Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa&quot; (1855). He was also the author (1852) of the &quot;Dissertation on the Progress of Mathematical and Physical Science,&quot; published in the eighth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

The Forbes River, Mount Forbes, and Forbes Glaciers in New Zealand are named after him as is Aiguille Forbes between the Glacier de Saleina and the Glacier du Tour in the Mont Blanc massif.

James David Forbes was a devout Christian, as can be seen in the work &quot;Life and Letters of James David Forbes&quot; (1873), a compilation of personal letters written by Forbes, co-authored by John Campbell Shairp and Forbes&#x27;s student Peter Guthrie Tait.

He died on 31 December 1868 and is buried in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. The grave is marked by a simple but large grey granite Celtic cross and lies on the south side of the main path just west of the roundel. His wife, Alicia Wauchope (1824–1885), is buried with him. His cousins were Scottish Episcopal Church leaders Alexander Penrose Forbes and George Hay Forbes. His son was the scientist George Forbes.

<text>Starlight Express is a 1984 musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Richard Stilgoe. It tells the story of a young but obsolete steam engine, Rusty, who races in a championship against modern locomotives of diesel and electric engines in the hope of impressing a first-class observation car, Pearl. Famously, the actors perform on roller skates.

Running for 7,409 performances in London, &quot;Starlight Express&quot; is the ninth-longest-running West End show. It is the most successful musical in Germany, where it has been performed in a purpose-built theatre since 1988, holding the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for most visitors to a musical in a single theatre.

==Background==
&quot;Starlight Express&quot; has its roots in three abandoned projects: an animated TV series based on &quot;The Railway Series&quot; (the book series that introduced Thomas the Tank Engine), a novelty pop single, and an animated film based on Cinderella.

In 1974, Lloyd Webber approached author Reverend W. Awdry about adapting Awdry&#x27;s Thomas the Tank Engine stories as an animated TV series. Following the meeting, Lloyd Webber started composing, with actor and children&#x27;s TV writer Peter Reeves contributing lyrics, alongside artist Brian Cosgrove animating for it. They pitched their material to Granada TV, who commissioned a pilot episode. The episode was completed in early 1976, but Granada ultimately decided not to produce a full series as they feared that Awdry&#x27;s stories were not then popular enough outside the UK to justify investing the time and money needed to make the series (ironically, the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; series later premiered seven months after &quot;Starlight Express&quot; and became highly successful).

After withdrawing from the project, Lloyd Webber heard a recording of an American soul singer, Earl Jordan, who could sing three notes at once in the style of a steam whistle. Lloyd Webber and Peter Reeves wrote a novelty pop song for Jordan called &quot;Engine of Love,&quot; released in 1977. The song failed to chart, but &quot;Engine of Love&quot; went on to feature in some productions of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; and the melody was also later used for &quot;He&#x27;ll Whistle At Me&quot;.

Around the same time as writing &quot;Engine of Love&quot;, an American TV station invited Lloyd Webber to compose songs for an animated film of Cinderella. In this version of the story, the Prince would hold a competition to decide which Engine would pull the royal train across the United States of America. Cinderella would be a steam engine, and the ugly sisters would be a diesel engine and an electric engine. The project went into development hell, but Lloyd Webber remained interested in telling a story with trains.

&quot;Starlight Express&quot; proper began in early 1981. Lloyd Webber asked lyricist Richard Stilgoe to help him revive the idea as a concert for schools, in the style of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s breakthrough musical, &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe presented two songs the following summer at the Sydmonton Festival, Lloyd Webber&#x27;s private event for showcasing new work. The director Trevor Nunn watched the performance and offered to help develop the material from something &quot;twee&quot; to something with more &quot;spectacle and theatre magic&quot;.

Together, Lloyd Webber, Stilgoe and Nunn developed the story to include the idea of trains and coaches racing. The choreographer Arlene Phillips was brought on board along with the designer John Napier, who suggested staging the show on roller skates.

In 1983, the first act of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; was workshopped by Nunn and Phillips with a cast that included the comedian Tracey Ullman. Based on the workshop&#x27;s success, &quot;Starlight Express&quot; began full-scale production, opening in the West End in March 1984.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Starlight Express&quot; has been revised many times since it was first produced. These revisions range from tweaks to lyrics to adding or removing entire songs, characters and subplots. The fundamental story, however, has stayed the same.

&quot;This synopsis reflects the show as it was first produced, in the West End in 1984.&quot;

=== Act 1 ===
A young boy falls asleep while playing with his toy trains, announcing it is race night. In his dreams, the trains come to life.

The reigning champion – a diesel engine from the U.S.A. called Greaseball – enters with his cavalcade train of several other diesel engines and three freight trucks. They boast of diesel&#x27;s supremacy (&quot;Rolling Stock&quot;). Next, a steam engine called Rusty enters. Greaseball mocks Rusty, who replies that he will win the championship, despite steam being obsolete compared to diesel (&quot;Call Me Rusty&quot;). The dreaming boy, Control, intervenes and orders Rusty to collect a passenger train from the marshalling yard. He returns with four coaches that make up the passenger train: a dining car called Dinah, a smoking car called Ashley, a buffet car called Buffy, and an observation car called Pearl. Control sends Rusty away to fetch a freight train as the coaches introduce themselves to the audience (&quot;A Lotta Locomotion&quot;). Greaseball returns. He boasts again, this time to the coaches (&quot;Pumping Iron&quot;). Rusty returns with the six trucks that make up the freight train: three boxcars called Rocky 1, Rocky 2 and Rocky 3, a brick truck called Flat-Top, an aggregate hopper called Dustin and a brake truck called C.B. They introduce themselves to the audience and argue with the coaches over whether it is preferable to carry people or cargo (&quot;Freight&quot;).

Control declares entries for the championship open. Six trains arrive to challenge Greaseball: Bobo, the French Sud-Est; Espresso, the Italian Settebello; Weltschaft, the German Class 103; Turnov, the Trans-Siberian Express from Russia; Hashamoto, the Japanese Shinkansen Bullet Train; and the City of Milton Keynes, the Advanced Passenger Train from Great Britain. Entries are about to close when a surprise entry – an electric engine called Electra – arrives. Accompanied by his train of five components – an armaments truck called Krupp, a repair truck called Wrench, a money truck called Purse, a freezer truck called Volta and an animal truck called Joule – Electra declares that electricity is the future of the railways (&quot;AC/DC&quot;). Greaseball and Electra square up to each other as the entrants form a parade to celebrate the race (&quot;Coda of Freight&quot;).

Control announces the rules of the championship: the trains will compete in pairs, with an engine pulling a coach. There will be three elimination heats, and the winner of each heat will move on to the finals to decide the fastest train. The engines start to pick their coaches. Rusty offers to race with Pearl, but she rejects him, explaining that she is waiting for her &#x27;dream train&#x27; (&quot;He Whistled at Me&quot;). Electra&#x27;s messenger, Purse, enters with an invitation from Electra. Even though Electra is not her dream train, she accepts, leaving Rusty alone.

The first heat pits Greaseball and Dinah against Espresso, Buffy, Hashimoto, and C.B. C.B. sabotages Hashimoto by applying his brakes at critical moments in the race. Greaseball and Dinah win comfortably, claiming a place in the finals. After the race, Dinah objects to Greaseball&#x27;s cheating. In response, he abandons her, and C.B. comforts Dinah (&quot;There&#x27;s Me&quot;). Meanwhile, a lonely Rusty has retreated to the freight yard where the former champion – an old steam engine called Poppa – sings a blues song to the trucks (&quot;Poppa&#x27;s Blues&quot;). Poppa tries to persuade Rusty to race without Pearl, urging him to believe in the Starlight Express. When Rusty refuses, Poppa introduces him to an old Pullman car called Memphis Belle (&quot;Belle The Sleeping Car&quot;). Rusty agrees to race with Belle. They compete in the second heat against Electra, Pearl, Weltschaft, and Joule. Electra and Pearl finish first, securing a place in the finals; Rusty and Belle finish last.

Already despondent after losing Pearl as his race partner, Rusty loses his last shreds of confidence. Poppa decides to step up and prove that steam power is still relevant, despite everyone&#x27;s misgivings, by racing himself in the third heat. Only Dustin is willing to run with him. Rusty points out that the race is already whole, but suddenly, Control announces that the British train has been scrapped, leaving space for a late entry. Poppa interprets this as a sign from the Starlight Express and enters the race. The third heat pits Poppa and Dustin against Bobo, Ashley, Turnov and Wrench. Poppa wins the race, securing a place in the finals against Greaseball and Electra, but the effort of outracing the others and pulling the hefty Dustin exhausts him. Now worn out, he begs Rusty to take his place. Rusty refuses at first, but then he notices Pearl with Electra and is jealous. When C.B. offers to race with him, Rusty announces that he will take Poppa&#x27;s place. Greaseball and the other competitors mock him and then leave. Alone, Rusty prays to the supposedly mythical Starlight Express for help in the final (&quot;Starlight Express&quot;).

=== Act 2 ===
The trains debate whether Rusty should be allowed to take Poppa&#x27;s place in the finals since he&#x27;s already competed and lost or whether the area should go to Bobo, who finished second in Poppa&#x27;s heat (&quot;The Rap&quot;). They ultimately decide to let Rusty race. Control offers the engines the chance to change partners. Pearl abandons Electra and joins Greaseball, leaving Dinah feeling betrayed. Dinah expresses shame at being uncoupled, although she cannot speak the word itself (&quot;U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D.&quot;). Ashley, Buffy, and Belle try to persuade Dinah to fight for Greaseball&#x27;s affection (&quot;Rolling Stock (Reprise)&quot;), but instead, she accepts an offer from Electra to replace Pearl in the finals. Elsewhere, C.B. hatches a plan. He tells Greaseball he will help him win the championship by sabotaging Rusty. He then tells Electra he will wipe out Greaseball, clearing the way for Electra to win. When Electra expresses his surprise at C.B.&#x27;s duplicity, C.B. explains that he has spent a career secretly causing train crashes for fun (&quot;C.B.&quot;).

The finals take place between Electra and Dinah, Greaseball and Pearl, and Rusty and C.B. C.B. sabotages Rusty, slowing him down so he misses a switch on the tracks and cannot finish the race. Electra and Greaseball finish in a dead heat. Control announces that there will be another race, with Electra and Greaseball going head-to-head to decide the winner. Rusty complains that he was cheated, but the marshals refuse to listen. Pearl confronts Greaseball, but he warns her to say nothing, as the marshals would also consider her complicit and punish her. Rusty retreats to the freight yard, where he bumps into the Rockies. They tell him he will never win without luck and should give up (&quot;Right Place, Right Time&quot;). The Rockies leave Rusty alone. He appeals again to the mythical Starlight Express for help, and this time, it hears. The Starlight Express, which is portrayed by the same actor as Poppa, appears in front of Rusty. The Starlight Express reminds Rusty that he already possesses the strength he needs if he believes in himself, inspiring him to enter the rerun of the final race. (&quot;I Am The Starlight&quot;). The Starlight Express disappears, and Rusty finds himself back in the freight yard with Dustin, who says he was asleep but felt the starlight&#x27;s presence. Rusty asks Dustin to race with him in the final. He accepts, and they head off together.

Moments before the race, Dinah, angry with how Electra treats her, disconnects from him. Electra quickly appeals to C.B. to take her place. The trains gather to watch what they expect will be a head-to-head final between Greaseball and Pearl and Electra and C.B.. Suddenly, Rusty arrives with Dustin, and the marshals allow him to enter the race. The race is fast and furious. This time, the downhill track turns Dustin&#x27;s weight into an advantage for Rusty. Greaseball struggles with an unwilling Pearl holding him back, and Electra uses all his power to disrupt his opponents. Electra zaps electricity at Greaseball but misses and injures Pearl. Greaseball, showing no concern, disconnects Pearl at full speed. Rusty diverts from the race course just in time to save her but at the cost of falling into a distant third place. To avoid being disqualified for not having a coach, Greaseball starts to grapple with Electra over C.B. The fight degenerates into chaos, and Greaseball, Electra, and C.B. crash, allowing Rusty to win the race. But instead of celebrating, he leaves immediately to find Pearl. Control warns that Rusty will cancel his lap of honor if he does not return quickly.

Meanwhile, humiliated and infuriated, Electra leaves the race track, swearing never to return (&quot;No Comeback&quot;). Greaseball and C.B. emerge in a tangled wreck. They lament the heavy toll racing has taken on them (&quot;One Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Too Many&quot;). Poppa demands that Greaseball and C.B. help find Rusty. Away from the other engines, Pearl fears that she caused Rusty to lose the race. She realises that of all the trains she&#x27;s raced with, only Rusty acted selflessly towards her (&quot;Only He&quot;). Rusty arrives. He tells Pearl that he won the race and confesses his love for her (&quot;Only You&quot;). The other trains arrive. Greaseball finally apologises to Dinah for his behaviour, and they reconcile. Greaseball complains that he&#x27;s finished as a racer, but Poppa offers to rebuild him into a steam engine. Control tries to assert some control, announcing that Rusty&#x27;s lap of honour is cancelled. Tired of Control&#x27;s behaviour, Poppa and the other engines tell Control to &quot;shut it&quot; and celebrate the second coming of steam power (&quot;Light at the End of the Tunnel&quot;).

==Musical numbers==
The musical numbers in &quot;Starlight Express&quot; have changed many times since the first production opened in 1984. Each new production is &quot;re-invented ... rewritten, rearranged, restaged and brought up to date ... rather than just [being] a copy of the original&quot;. This is because the show was envisaged as an introduction to live theatre for young audiences, particularly audiences &quot;for whom theatre was a no-go zone&quot;. The score is grounded in popular music, which changes with each generation. Therefore, as Lloyd Webber has said, &quot;&quot;Starlight Express&quot; by its nature has to change&quot;.

Later productions have used additional songs with lyrics by Don Black, David Yazbek, Nick Coler and Lauren Aquilina, and with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s son, Alastair.

==Production history==

===West End (1984–2002) | Wembley (2024-)===

The original production (1984–1992)

The first production of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; opened on 27 March 1984 at the Apollo Victoria Theatre. It was directed by Trevor Nunn. Arlene Phillips created the roller-skating choreography. John Napier designed the set, which featured race tracks extending from the stage into the auditorium, as well as a six-tonne steel bridge which lifted and tilted to connect the various levels of the set.

The original cast included Stephanie Lawrence, Frances Ruffelle, Jeff Shankley, Jeffrey Daniel, P. P. Arnold, and Ray Shell.

The production received some minor updates after the Broadway show opened, bringing some new material across productions, including adding &quot;Engine of Love&quot; and &quot;Make Up My Heart&quot;, and cutting &quot;No Comeback&quot;.

The New Starlight Express (1992–2002)

In November 1992, the London production was relaunched with significant revisions as &quot;The New Starlight Express&quot;. Numerous changes from subsequent productions were incorporated:

* Twelve songs were removed: the Overture, &quot;Engine of Love&quot;, &quot;Call Me Rusty&quot;, &quot;Hitching and Switching&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s Me&quot;, &quot;Belle The Sleeping Car&quot;, &quot;Heat Three&quot;, &quot;Wide Smile High Style&quot;, &quot;No Comeback&quot;, &quot;Only He&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot;.
* Five songs were added: &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;ll Whistle at Me&quot;, &quot;Make Up My Heart&quot;, &quot;Next Time You Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;The Megamix&quot;
* &quot;The Rap&quot; opened the second act and was rewritten entirely to become an anthem to racing.
* The &quot;Entry of National Trains&quot; was moved to the show&#x27;s opening. &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; was forced to after &quot;AC/DC&quot;.
* The characters of Belle and C.B. were cut. This required substantial changes to the plot, as without a clear villain, Rusty, Electra and Greaseball had to cause their problems or be the victims of circumstance to move the story along.
* Rather than winning a heat each, as in the five-race structure, Greaseball and Electra come first and second in the first heat, securing their final place. Rusty did not race until the last, only reluctantly taking Poppa&#x27;s place after the title song. After the Uphill Final, when Dinah uncouples Electra, with no C.B., he partners Buffy instead for the Downhill Final. At the end of the race, Electra and Greaseball now crashed accidentally, and Electra took C.B.&#x27;s place in &quot;One Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Too Many&quot;.

&quot;Starlight Express&quot; closed in London on 12 January 2002. Considered one continuous production despite revisions, &quot;Starlight Express&quot; ran for 7,409 performances, making it the ninth longest-running West End show.

The Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre Production (2024-2025)

&quot;Starlight Express&quot; returned to London in summer 2024. The new production, directed by Luke Sheppard (&quot;&amp; Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Little Big Things&quot;), began previews at the specifically-designed Starlight Auditorium at Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre on 8 June with official opening 30 June 2024.

In addition to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Richard Stilgoe, the creative team includes set designer Tim Hatley (&quot;Back to the Future&quot;), video designer Andrzej Goulding (&quot;Life of Pi&quot;), costume designer Gabriella Slade (&quot;Six&quot;), Lighting Designer Howard Hudson (&amp;Juliet) as well as the return of Arlene Phillips as creative dramaturg. The production introduces Jeevan Braich as Rusty, Kayna Montecillo as Pearl, Jade Marvin as Momma McCoy, Al Knott as Greaseball, Eve Humphrey as Dinah and Tom Pigram as Electra.

Some characters&#x27; genders are different from the original West End production, with Greaseball being female and Electra explicitly using they/them pronouns. Poppa is changed to Momma, as in the Bochum production, and is played by the same actor as plays Control&#x27;s mother in the first scene. Control is played by a child actor and is onstage frequently, often on a scooter. A notable change is that Rusty now wins, with Hydra, by making steam from hydrogen (rather than coal). This is in a new number &quot;Hydrogen&quot; (Lloyd Webber and Joe Stilgoe). A cast recording of the London 2024 production was released on 15 November 2024. The production is set to close on October 26th, 2025, after being extended. It would’ve closed on June 8th.

The production feature one of the largest Lighting and Sound systems in UK theatre as well as unitises a whole range of technology from using ZakTrack for tracking of cast around the venue. Using a lighting rig from Christie Lites UK with a range of Martin lighting fixtures as well as from Robe. A huge production team lead by Mark Carey with Lighting being headed up by Oliver Thomas and Tom Johnson (Theatre.Lighting) and sound being headed up by Dominic Bell with a large deployment of d&amp;b audiotechnik speakers, Shure Microphones and IEMs.

There is a large production team who run the show, LX team; Jim, Sam, Drew, Chloe Sound Team; Hannah, Olly, Olly D, Antoine, Steph and Beth 

===Broadway (1987–1989)===
The Broadway production of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; began performances on Broadway on 24 February 1987 and opened on 15 March at the Gershwin Theatre. It ran for 761 regular performances and 22 previews, closing on 8 January 1989.

Created by the original team of Trevor Nunn (direction), Arlene Phillips (choreography) and John Napier (design), this version of Starlight Express was extensively revised from the original West End production. The story was localised, with the trains racing across America for a &quot;silver dollar&quot; trophy. The plot was streamlined, with one fewer race than the West End production. Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe also made many changes to the music and lyrics, notably adding a ballad for Pearl, &quot;Make Up My Heart&quot;, which has been included in every production since, and a reworked version of &quot;Engine of Love&quot;, the novelty pop song Lloyd Webber wrote in 1977 for Earl Jordan. Additional adjustments were made to the characters&#x27; costumes, including giving Rusty a &quot;Starlight Express&quot; outfit after &quot;I Am the Starlight&quot;, which was deemed too similar to the rolling stock uniforms. This was eventually removed due to a lack of quick-change time and the costume not being different enough.

===Bochum (1988 to present)===
On 12 June 1988, &quot;Starlight Express&quot; opened at the purpose-built theatre in Bochum, Germany. As of 2023, the new reimagined production was still running and has been seen by more than 19 million people. The production took a hiatus only due to the COVID 19 Pandemic, but now continues to run as normal. 

The creative team included the choreographer and designer from the West End and Broadway productions, Arlene Phillips and John Napier, alongside a new director, Dion McHugh. &quot;Starlight Express&quot; in Bochum largely followed the template set by the Broadway production. However, the creative team made further revisions, notably removing a character, Belle, who had been part of both the West End and Broadway productions. At the time of the Bochum production&#x27;s opening, three markedly different &quot;Starlight Express&quot; versions ran concurrently. The display changed many times, notably in 2018, to mark the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary. After extensive workshops in London, songs were cut, characters removed, female engines added, and most notably, Papa changed to Mama. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Arlene Philips felt the current zeitgeist was to make the show more &quot;gender friendly&quot;.

The &quot;Starlight Express Theater&quot; features tracks on three levels in a U-shape, with the audience sitting in the middle and around these tracks. That the venue took less than one year to build is documented in the Guinness Book of Records.

In March 2008, the production ran a talent competition called &quot;Musical Showstar 2008&quot; on German television to find the next Rusty and Pearl. Kevin Köhler and Anna-Maria Schmidt won the competition. Schmidt dropped out of training, but Köhler premiered as Rusty on 1 August 2008.

==== Subsequent revisions ====
The production has been updated periodically since 1988, taking in some changes from other worldwide shows:

* In 2003, the songs &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;Allein im Licht der Sterne&quot; (&quot;Next Time You Fall in Love&quot;) were added to the show, the latter replacing &quot;Du Allein&quot; (&quot;Only You&quot;). A &quot;Megamix&quot; was also added to the end of the show. &quot;Liebesexpress&quot; (&quot;Engine of Love&quot;) was shortened. An extra track was added to the set, allowing greater flexibility in staging and more tricks for the skaters.
* In 2006, the Hip Hoppers replaced the Rockies from the second U.S. tour.
* In 2007, the Rap was altered again.
* 2008, the &quot;Entry of the National Trains&quot; was moved to the show&#x27;s beginning. &quot;There&#x27;s Me&quot; was cut, and &quot;Engine of Love&quot; was replaced by a shortened version of &quot;Call Me Rusty&quot;. &quot;Allein im Licht der Sterne&quot; was cut. Additionally, the title song was reworked to the &quot;When your goodnights have been said&quot; lyric, &quot;He&#x27;ll Whistle at Me&quot; had lyrics corrected, &quot;The Rap&quot; was changed to &quot;It&#x27;s Race Time&quot;, and the final duet between Rusty and Pearl was updated to the 2007 U.K. tour version of &quot;Only He&quot;.
* In 2013, &quot;A Whole Lotta Locomotion&quot; (&quot;Nie Genug&quot;) replaced &quot;A Lotta Locomotion&quot;. &quot;I Do&quot; (Für Immer), a new song written for the 2012 U.K. and 2013 Asia tour by Lloyd Webber&#x27;s son Alastair, replaced &quot;Only He&quot;. Several songs had lyrics changed and costumes altered with a nod to the original London production.
*In 2017, Krupp, Electra&#x27;s armaments truck, was cut from the production.

==== 2018 revisions ====
In 2017, Lloyd Webber visited the production for the charity gala in which the show was performed in English and found it &#x27;unrecognisable&#x27; following years of incremental revisions. Arlene Phillips added that in 2018, the &#x27;overall tone of the show [now appeared] a little bit sexist&#x27;. Lloyd Webber resolved to shut down the production if he could not find a way to &#x27;get Starlight back to its roots&#x27;. He wrote new material and workshopped for six performances at The Other Palace in London in September 2017 before being rolled out in Bochum. Phillips directed the stripped-back workshop production with no set, costumes or roller skates. These changes included:

* adding a new song and musical motif for the coaches called &quot;I Got Me&quot; (&quot;Ich Bin Ich&quot;), with lyrics by Lauren Aquilina
* removing several songs that no longer fit the theme
* substantially revising the orchestration in favour of a more rock-based 1980s sound
* reintroducing the Rockies, replacing the Hip Hoppers
* changing the genders of Poppa and Bobo from male to female, becoming &#x27;Momma&#x27; and &#x27;Coco&#x27;. Rocky 3 became female; Volta became male.
* replacing Ashley and Buffy with Belle, the lounge car, and Tassita, the quiet carriage (in the German production, Tassita would become Carrie, the luggage car, and Belle became a bar car)
* replacing Electra&#x27;s money truck, Purse, with Killerwatt, the security truck

In May 2018, the Bochum production closed for a month to rehearse the new material and for significant technical updates to the 30-year-old auditorium. Lloyd Webber, Phillips and original designer John Napier returned to oversee the changes, which Lloyd Webber now considers the definitive version of &quot;Starlight Express&quot;. As well as the changes from The Other Palace, they also:

* updated the German lyrics of several songs within the show
* redesigned many costumes based on new designs
* installed completely new sound and lighting
* introduced the British train named &#x27;Brexit&#x27;, renamed the Japanese train &#x27;Manga&#x27;, renamed the French train &#x27;Coco&#x27;
* made some characters &quot;gender variable&quot;: Rocky 3, Wrench, Volta, and Manga – although primarily meant to be female, female, male, and male respectively – may be played by an actor of a different gender if it&#x27;s necessary due to vacations/injuries etc. of the original actor, as well as (as of June 2019) Brexit (original meant to be male).

===Las Vegas (1993–1997)===
An abridged, 90-minute production without an intermission opened at the Las Vegas Hilton on 14 September 1993, with direction by Arlene Phillips and with Reva Rice reprising her role of Pearl. Several songs were cut, and many lyrics trimmed to make it fit into its 90-minute run time with great care taken to preserve the plot&#x27;s integrity. This production was the first permanent legitimate musical theatre production in Las Vegas. However, concessions were made through a shortened run time and betting references in the race sequences. The Coaches&#x27; costumes were also given a &quot;Vegas Showgirl&quot; makeover during the run. This production used the filmed race sequences from the first U.S. tour (which played in the background during the live races on stage) and some of the set pieces. When the hotel changed ownership, the new owners ended the run before its 5-year contract concluded, with the show closing on 30 November 1997.

=== Mexico City (1997–1998) ===
From October 1997 until April 1998, a Spanish-language production entitled &quot;Expreso Astral&quot; was played at the Teatro Polanco in Mexico City. Mostly, it was a Spanish version of the Las Vegas production (using the same edited script) with costumes and sets inspired by several earlier shows. The presentation was directed by Bobby Love, with the Spanish translation by Marco Villafan. Many of the character&#x27;s names were Hispanicized, with Rusty becoming Ferro, Pearl becoming Perla, Poppa becoming El Jefe, and the National Engines were localised with Carioca, a Brazilian train, and Pibe, an Argentine train. A cast recording of this production was made but was never released due to complications with the rights.

=== Touring productions ===

==== North America ====
With a few changes, a downsized version of the Broadway production toured the U.S. and Canada from November 1989 until April 1991. Rather than scaling the show up to fill stadiums, the set was small enough to fit regular regional theatres. The show was the same as the Australian/Japanese touring production, with the &quot;Silver Dollar&quot; subplot removed and the character of Memphis Belle cut completely. With the &quot;Silver Dollar&quot; plot drawn, an abbreviated version of &quot;The Rap&quot; from London was used to open Act II. The races were primarily shown on film; however, a tiny race track extended to the audience. The costumes were based on the original Broadway production, and some were recycled directly from that earlier production.

The second U.S. tour opened in Biloxi, Mississippi on 1 April 2003 and toured the U.S. until 13 June 2004. The show was originally performed featuring the songs &quot;Wide Smile&quot;, &quot;Girls&#x27; Rolling Stock&quot;, and &quot;Only He&quot;, but for reasons Troika (the production company) never disclosed, it was later shortened by the removal of &quot;Wide Smile&quot; and &quot;Girls&#x27; Rolling Stock&quot; and &quot;Only He&quot; was replaced by &quot;Next Time You Fall In Love&quot;. This production featured revisions to the material by David Yazbek, including a new song, &quot;A Whole Lotta Locomotion&quot;, and rewriting &quot;The Rap&quot;. Due to the restrictions of touring spaces, digital video company Inition was commissioned to produce high-definition race footage in 3D film to replace the live races.

====Europe====
The first U.K. tour of &quot;Starlight Express&quot; (now entitled &quot;Starlight Express: The Third Dimension&quot;) opened on 4 November 2004 in Manchester. The production was produced by David Ian Productions and directed by Mykal Rand. Originally adapted from the second U.S. tour, most of David Yazbek&#x27;s contributions were removed after Andrew Lloyd Webber visited a performance. In November 2007 the first U.K. tour production toured Stockholm, Gothenburg, Oslo and Helsinki, using an expanded set designed for use in stadium venues.

Bill Kenwright Productions presented a second tour of the U.K., beginning at the New Wimbledon Theatre on 10 May 2012. This production included a new song, &quot;I Do&quot;, written by the composer&#x27;s son, Alastair Lloyd-Webber in place of &quot;Only You&quot; or &quot;Next Time You Fall in Love&quot;. Other changes included the character of Ashley The Smoking Car being replaced by Duvay The Sleeping Car due to the recent British smoking ban, the subsequent redundancy of smoking cars, and the generally negative public attitude toward smoking. The production reused the race sequences filmed for the first U.K. tour.

==== Asia ====
A large-scale &quot;in-the-round&quot; production played in stadiums in Tokyo and Osaka from November 1987 to January 1988. Due to the scale of this production, the National Engines and Electra&#x27;s Entourage were doubled up to fill the performance area. This production was based on the Broadway production, with only minor changes, such as removing Belle and the &quot;Silver Dollar&quot; subplot. The stage design was unique to this production, featuring landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and a platform that could elevate up from the floor to change the setting of the races. This tour went on to Australia through 1988. Due to popular demand, the in-the-round term returned to Japan from 24 March to 18 July 1990.

2013, the second U.K. tour travelled to Hong Kong, where it played at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts from 11 October to 4 November 2013. From there, it moved to Singapore, playing at the Marina Bay Sands from 13 November to 24 November 2013. This version of the show is licensed for amateur theatre groups as &quot;The Definitive Starlight Express&quot;.

==== Australia ====
The large-scale tour that began in Japan in 1987 continued to Australia, where it visited Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth, ending in May 1988. (Minor characters such as The Components and The Nationals were doubled during this tour and given alternate names to fill the more extensive arena-sized set.)

==== New Zealand ====

In 2009, following an extended run in Europe, the props and costumes from the second U.K. tour were shipped to New Zealand to form a new production. This production played arenas in Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland in July and August 2009 and featured some performers from various other international productions.

===Non-replica productions===
====Starlight Express on Ice (1997)====
As the first non-replica production of the show, it was completely redesigned by Feld Entertainment &#x27;s On Ice unit with the Really Useful Group. It toured the United States from until . The production was directed by Robin Cousins and featured figure- and stunt-skaters miming pre-recorded music. It failed to find an audience and closed halfway through its scheduled tour.

==== Johannesburg, South Africa (2013) ====
The South African premiere occurred at the Joburg Theatre from 2 July until 1 September 2013. The production was directed by Janice Honeyman with choreography by Karen Bruce, who was given &quot;carte blanche&quot; to reimagine the show.

==== Regional and amateur licensed productions ====
The show is available to regional and school groups in the U.S.A. The regional premiere was in Tuacahn, Utah, in June 2013. It is licensed through Concord Theatricals.

<text>Edward Clark (April 1, 1815May 4, 1880) was the eighth Governor of Texas. His term coincided with the beginning of the American Civil War.

==Early life==
Edward Clark was born on April 1, 1815, in New Orleans, Louisiana. His father was named Elijah Clark Jr. His paternal uncle, John Clark, served as the Governor of Georgia from 1819 to 1823. His paternal grandfather was Elijah Clarke.

Clark grew up in Georgia. After his father died in the 1830s, he moved to Montgomery, Alabama, with his mother and studied the law.

==Career==
Clark moved to Texas in 1842 and set up a law practice. He served in the Texas Annexation Convention and two terms as a state representative in the Texas Legislature. During the Mexican–American War he served on the staff of Major General J. Pinckney Henderson and fought in the Battle of Monterrey. When the war ended, he served as secretary of state under Governor Elisha M. Pease and as lieutenant governor serving under Governor Sam Houston. When Sam Houston refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Clark became governor.
Among Clark&#x27;s first actions was to order the surrender of all fire arms and ammunition from private merchants to the state. Furthermore, all privately owned firearms were to be canvassed. Few weapons were ever turned in and most Texans did not comply for fear of future confiscation. (Lone Star by T.R. Fehrenbach, pg 353)

After losing the governor&#x27;s race by 124 votes to Francis Lubbock, Clark became a colonel in the Texas militia during the American Civil War. In 1863 he joined the Confederate States Army and was commissioned colonel of the 14th Texas Infantry Regiment. He commanded the unit, as part of the Greyhound Division, until being wounded in the Battle of Pleasant Hill. A promotion to brigadier general was not confirmed by the Confederate Congress and he left the service; however, in 1865 he was made a brigadier in the militia. He fled briefly to Mexico at the end of the American Civil War, and returned home to Marshall, Texas.

==Personal life==

Clark married Lucy Long in 1840, but she died shortly after. He married Martha Melissa Evans in 1849. They had four children, including:
* William Evans Clark (Apr 1849 in Marshall, Harrison County, Texas – Jun 1852 in same);
* John Evans Clark (30 Jan 1852 in Marshall, Harrison County, Texas – 9 Oct 1923 in same), who married twice and had at least three children;
* William Evans Alfred Clark (12 Jul 1853 – 9 Apr 1879); and
* Nannie M Clark (c. 1855 – 8 Jan 1913 Harrison County, Texas), m. 23 Nov 1881 in Harrison County to Daniel C Wallis (alias Wallace).

==Death==
Clark died on May 4, 1880, in Marshall, Texas. His grave in the Marshall City Cemetery is marked with a historical marker.
