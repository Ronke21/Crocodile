<text>Clann na Poblachta (; &quot;Family/Children of the Republic&quot;) was an Irish republican political party founded in 1946 by Seán MacBride, a former Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).

==Foundation==

Clann na Poblachta was officially launched on 6 July 1946 in Barry&#x27;s Hotel in Dublin. It held its first Ard Fheis in November 1947 in the Balalaika Ballroom.

Seán MacBride&#x27;s new party appealed to disillusioned young urban voters and republicans. Many had become alienated from Éamon de Valera&#x27;s Fianna Fáil, the main republican party in Ireland, which in the view of more militant republicans had betrayed their principles by executing IRA prisoners in the unrest in Ireland during the Second World War. A large majority of the founding members of the Clann had been members of the IRA at some stage of their lives. Clann na Poblachta also drew support from people who were tired of the old Civil War politics and were disillusioned with Éamon de Valera and his approach to the partition of Ireland. Many supporters also questioned the governments economic policies and wanted more attention paid to social issues. In post-war Europe many people blamed the social evils of unemployment, poor housing, poverty and disease for the rise of fascism and communism. This new mood influenced people in Ireland also. Some people saw Clann na Poblachta as a replacement for Fianna Fáil. Others saw in it a replacement for the marginalised Sinn Féin, others still a break from the traditional pro- and anti-treaty Civil War division. The new party grew rapidly during 1947.

The party was influenced by social democratic policies such as United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, British prime minister Clement Attlee&#x27;s welfare state, and elements of European Christian Democracy as well as Irish republicanism. It attracted a diverse range of people, from traditional republicans such as Noel Hartnett and Kathleen Clarke to social democrats such as Dr. Noël Browne, who had been attracted to the party because of its commitment to fight tuberculosis, and Peadar Cowan, a former Labour Party executive member who had resigned in disgust owing to the infighting within that party at the time.

Irish social and health services were both starved of money and struggling with a social system where the Catholic Church&#x27;s hostility to state action obstructed progress. TB was a scourge and Ireland lagged far behind the rest of Western Europe in tackling it. Furthermore, there was no free secondary education (a situation that continued into the 1960s). Under-development and poor economic performance drove high levels of emigration and rural depopulation.

Clann na Poblachta was formed at a time during a period of turmoil in Irish politics. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the two major political parties, were weak. Fine Gael was in disarray because of their rival&#x27;s seemingly hegemonic dominance and because of a perceived failure to be able to offer anything to disillusioned Fianna Fáil supporters. Fianna Fáil was visibly losing support because of the failure of the party&#x27;s program to end mass unemployment, poverty and emigration. The Labour Party had bitterly split in 1944 over personal differences between William O&#x27;Brien and James Larkin, while Clann na Talmhan was regarded as being too specialist and too greatly concerned with the needs of farmers.

==Electoral success==
In October 1947, Clann na Poblachta won two by-elections (in Dublin County and Tipperary). The Taoiseach, de Valera, saw the threat posed by the new party, and in February 1948 he called a snap general election to try to catch Clann na Poblachta off guard. At the time Clann had hopes of replacing Fianna Fáil both as the majority republican party and as the leading party of the state. De Valera&#x27;s gambit was only partially successful. In the 1948 election Clann na Poblachta won 173,166 votes and ten seats in the Dáil Éireann — far fewer than was expected but formed a coalition government with the Fine Gael party. In September 1948 the newly formed coalition government released the bodies of Irish Republicans who had been executed in the early 1940s and buried within prisons: Richard Goss, Patrick McGrath, George Plant, Charlie Kerins and Maurice O&#x27;Neill. However, the election did produce enough seats among the opposition groups to cost Fianna Fáil its majority. The opposition parties soon realized that if they banded together, they would be able to form a government with the support of seven independents and consign de Valera to opposition for the first time in 16 years. That First Inter-Party Government was made up of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, National Labour, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, and some independents.

Clann had stood on a platform of &quot;get them out&quot;; hence, a coalition with Fianna Fáil was clearly not an option. However, the republicans in Clann were reluctant to serve in a government led by Fine Gael. They were particularly opposed to a government headed by Fine Gael leader Richard Mulcahy, who had been a Free State general during the Civil War. At the suggestion of William Norton, the Labour leader, it was agreed that no party leader would be Taoiseach. John A. Costello, who had served as Attorney-General to Cumann na nGaedheal governments in the 1920s and 1930s, became Fine Gael&#x27;s choice for Taoiseach. Norton became Tánaiste, while MacBride was appointed as Minister for External Affairs. Clann was an uneasy coalition of socialists and republicans; to placate the left wing, MacBride named Noël Browne for appointment as Minister for Health. However, many of the party&#x27;s republicans remained unreconciled to serving with Fine Gael, and the very act of joining the government weakened the party.

On taking office MacBride burnished the party&#x27;s republican anti-partitionist credentials by having Costello nominate the northern Protestant Denis Ireland to Seanad Éireann. Ireland was the first member of the Oireachtas to be resident in Northern Ireland.

==In government==
===Foreign affairs===
As Minister for External Affairs and a strong republican, MacBride was seen as instrumental in the repeal of the External Relations Act 1936, under which King George VI, who had been proclaimed King of Ireland in December 1936, fulfilled the diplomatic functions of a head of state. In September 1948 Costello announced in Canada that the government was about to declare Ireland a republic. The requisite legislation—The Republic of Ireland Act 1948—was passed through the Oireachtas, and at Easter 1949 the Republic of Ireland came into existence, with the King&#x27;s remaining functions granted instead to the President of Ireland.

MacBride regarded Ireland as a republic in any case (in much the same way as de Valera did) and saw the repeal of the Act as merely removing the last vestiges of the British connection. He was however deeply angry that Costello had stolen his idea, and refused to attend the official ceremony marking the inauguration of the Republic of Ireland.

The Government and opposition jointly mounted what they called the &quot;Anti-Partition Campaign&#x27;, arguing the opinion that partition was the only obstacle preventing a united Ireland. At foreign conferences, Irish delegates stated their cause for the ending of partition. This campaign had no effect whatsoever on the unionist government in Northern Ireland.

MacBride was Minister of External Affairs when the Council of Europe was drafting the European Convention on Human Rights. He served as President of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe from 1949 to 1950 and is credited with being a key force in securing the acceptance of this convention, which was finally signed in Rome on 4 November 1950. In 1950 he was president of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Council of Europe, and he was vice-president of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation from 1948 to 1951. He was responsible for Ireland not joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

As Minister for External Affairs, MacBride declined the offer of Ireland joining NATO to resist Soviet aggression. He refused because it would mean that the Republic recognised Northern Ireland. He did however state that Ireland was strongly opposed to communism. In 1950 he offered a bi-lateral alliance to the United States, but this was rejected. Ireland remained outside the military alliance. In 1949 Ireland joined the Organisation For European Economic Co-Operation and the Council of Europe as founder-members.

MacBride also argued for the &quot;return of sterling assets&quot; to Ireland: essentially a decoupling of the Irish pound from the Pound sterling by selling British gilts and investing the money in domestic enterprise. Officials in the Irish Department of Finance, who had an excellent relationship with the British Treasury and thought a decoupling would isolate Ireland and discourage investment, resisted the policy. The matter came to a head at the time of the 1949 devaluation of sterling. Despite two government meetings to discuss decoupling, it was decided to retain the sterling link—which remained until 1979.

===Public health policies and the anti-tuberculosis campaign===
Noël Browne proved highly controversial as Minister for Health. A medical doctor, he became famous for two policies. One of these was a successful anti-tuberculosis (TB) campaign. Free mass X-rays were introduced to identify TB sufferers, who were given free hospital treatment. New drugs were also introduced to fight the disease. Though Browne made a significant contribution to the campaign, it had actually originated with Conn Ward, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in de Valera&#x27;s government; it was Ward&#x27;s preparatory work and Browne&#x27;s practical implementation that produced the acclaimed scheme that practically wiped out TB in Ireland.

===Mother and child scheme===
Browne&#x27;s second initiative was much more controversial. In 1950, Browne tried to put the parts of the Health Act 1947 into effect. This Act would give free health care to all mothers and children up to the age of sixteen, regardless of income. However, the Mother and Child Scheme, as it became known, faced stiff opposition from Irish doctors and the Catholic Bishops of Ireland. Doctors opposed the deal because they feared a reduction in their incomes and because they were worried about state interference between patient and doctor. The Catholic Bishops opposed the Act because it seemed a dangerously communistic idea to them. They feared it might lead to the supply of birth control and abortion. Browne met with the Bishops and thought that he had satisfied them. However his handling of the affair alienated possible supporters in the hierarchy, notably Bishop John Dignan, and those elements of the medical profession privately supportive of the Mother and Child Scheme. In addition his poor attendance at cabinet meetings and strained relationships with cabinet colleagues meant that they too failed to support him. On 11 April 1951 MacBride as party leader demanded Browne&#x27;s resignation and he withdrew from the Cabinet. Browne left Clann na Poblachta and several other TDs followed him out of the party, destroying the fragile internal unity of the party.

==Decline and dissolution==
In 1951 the coalition faced increasing pressure to remain afloat and so an election was called. Clann na Poblachta was reduced to just two seats. Noel Browne and Jack McQuillan, both of whom were elected as independents, supported de Valera&#x27;s minority government. In 1954 another general election was called and the Second Inter-Party Government took office, again under Costello as Taoiseach. Although Clann na Poblachta reached a confidence and supply agreement with the government, it did not join it.

In keeping with the republican views of many of its key supporters, Clann had throughout maintained close links with republicans in Northern Ireland who espoused similar views, accepting the 1937 Constitution and the government operating under it as legitimate in the Republic of Ireland (differing from Sinn Féin on this issue) but keeping open the option of armed struggle in Northern Ireland. The most prominent link of this kind was between the Clann and Liam Kelly and his Fianna Uladh organisation, even though Kelly and the Fianna Uladh&#x27;s armed wing (Saor Uladh) were engaged in a military campaign in Northern Ireland. In 1954 the Clann made Kelly&#x27;s election to Seanad Éireann (courtesy of Fine Gael councillors&#x27; votes) a condition for supporting the Second Inter-Party Government. Kelly had been imprisoned at the time for making a seditious speech.

The Government&#x27;s increasingly firm action against the IRA, which had just launched the Border Campaign, was one of the main reasons why the Clann withdrew its support at the beginning of 1957, along with a sharp deterioration in the economy.

At the 1957 election MacBride lost his seat in Dáil Éireann, and his failure to secure a seat in two subsequent by-elections ended his political career. The party contested the 1961 general election but only one candidate was elected to the Dáil. John Tully, elected for Cavan, was the only Clann na Poblachta TD to emerge from the 1965 general election.

The party entered talks with the Labour Party about a possible merger, but these ended in failure because the participants could not agree on the focus of any merged party, or whether Sinn Féin or the National Progressive Democrats could be included. At the party Ard Fheis on 10 July 1965, Clann na Poblachta voted to dissolve itself.

<text>Köpingsvik is a locality situated in Borgholm Municipality, Kalmar County, Sweden with 599 inhabitants in 2010. It is located about east of the city of Borgholm on the island Öland.

Köpingsvik is known as a tourist center, offering large and modern camping sites. Nearby are the historic sites of Borgholm Castle and Halltorps Estate.

Köping (historically) was an important Viking Age port of what is today&#x27;s Sweden, covering an area of approximately , almost four times larger than the similar site on the island of Björkö near Stockholm. Köping was in operation from the 7th to the 13th century. It was also an important center of early Christianity in Sweden. Remains of an unfinished, massive 12th century church long have been excavated as well as the largest collection of the so-called &quot;eskilstunakistor&quot;, 75 pieces. During the last ten years there have been several small excavations which have confirmed the earlier findings and the importance of the site. Note that these findings are almost unknown to public in Sweden and the ruling view is that the little site on Björkö is Sweden&#x27;s &quot;oldest town&quot;.

Köping faded away around 1200, and Kalmar took over as the most important harbour town in south-eastern Sweden.

Köping is claimed by some amateur historians and historians as a possible alternative to Björkö for the location of the old viking village Birka in SvíÞjóð (the ancient name for Sweden). Birka is mentioned in Vita Ansgari and the work of Adam of Bremen. He states that Birka is situated directly north of Jomsborg and directly opposite to Kurland and at the same distance between them. This theory has not been widely accepted.

<text>Latte () or caffè latte (), also known as &#x27;, &#x27; or , is a coffee drink of Italian origin made with espresso and steamed milk, traditionally served in a glass. Variants include the chocolate-flavored &quot;caffè mocha&quot; or replacing the coffee with another beverage base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; alternatives to milk, such as soy milk, coconut milk, almond milk or oat milk, are also used.

The term comes from or (from , ); in English orthography, either or both words sometimes have an accent on the final &quot;e&quot; (a hyperforeignism in the case of *&quot;latté&quot;). In Northern Europe and Scandinavia, the term has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk. In France, is from the original name of the beverage (caffè latte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a &quot;latte&quot; is in French called ( using cream instead of milk) and in German .

==Definition and etymology==

===Definition===

A caffè latte consists of one or more shots of espresso, served in a glass (or sometimes a cup), into which hot steamed milk is added. The difference between a caffè latte and a cappuccino is that the cappuccino is served in a small cup with a layer of thick foam on top of the milk, and a caffè latte is served in a larger glass (or cup), without the layer of thick foam. Thus, a caffè latte is much milkier than a cappuccino, resulting in a milder coffee taste. The way the milk is steamed for a caffè latte results in very fine bubbles being incorporated in the hot milk. This microfoam can be poured in such a way as to form patterns in the white microfoam and brown crema (latte art). The texture of the microfoam changes the taste and feel of the drink.

A similar drink is the , which is also served in a glass, but the espresso is added to the glass after the steamed milk. In Italy, milky coffee drinks such as caffè latte, , and cappuccino are almost always prepared for breakfast only.

In the United States, a latte is often heavily sweetened with 3% sugar (or even more). These sweeteners usually come in the form of refined white sugars, artificial sweeteners or agave syrup.

===Etymology===

In English-speaking countries, is shorthand for or (from , ), which is similar to the French , the Spanish , the Catalan , or the Portuguese .

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the term was first used in English in 1867 by William Dean Howells in his essay &quot;Italian Journeys&quot;, but as this preceded the spread of espresso machines, this drink would have been &quot;nothing like the lattes found today at specialty coffee shops&quot;.

==History==

===Origin===
The drink is thought to have &quot;technically originated&quot; in 17th-century Europe.

The modern caffè latte appeared in the 20th century, following the invention of the espresso machine in the 19th century.

===Outside Europe===
In the United States, latte was popularized in Seattle, Washington, in the early 1980s.

In South Korea, espresso and its variants (cappuccino, latte, and &quot;caffè mocha&quot;) became popular in 2000.

==Politics==
Calling people &quot;latte drinkers&quot; pejoratively has become a common political attack in some Western cultures. The popularity of espresso drinking in large cities, especially among more affluent urban populations, has caused some to consider it elitist behavior. In the United States, conservative political commentators have been known to call their opponents &quot;latte-drinking liberal elites&quot; or &quot;latte liberals&quot;. In Canadian politics, latte drinking is used to portray people as out-of-touch intellectuals and the antithesis of the Tim Hortons coffee drinker, who is considered representative of an ordinary Canadian.

According to a 2018 study, 16% of liberals in the United States prefer lattes, whereas 9% of conservatives and 11% of moderates do. The study states further that the overwhelming majority of people, whether they are liberal, conservative or moderate, express a preference for brewed coffee.

<doc id="269502" wikidata="Q313098" url="?curid=269502" title="Paul Rodgers">
<text>Paul Bernard Rodgers (born 17 December 1949) is an English-Canadian singer, songwriter and musician. He was the lead vocalist of numerous successful rock bands, including Free, Bad Company, the Firm and the Law. He also has performed as a solo artist and collaborated with the remaining active members of Queen under the moniker Queen + Paul Rodgers, from 2004 to 2009. A poll in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him number 55 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;. In 2011, Rodgers received the British Academy&#x27;s Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music.

Rodgers has been cited as a significant influence on various rock singers. In 1991, John Mellencamp called Rodgers &quot;the best rock singer ever&quot;. Freddie Mercury in particular liked Rodgers and his aggressive style. Rodgers holds joint citizenship, after becoming a Canadian citizen in 2011.

==Early career==
Rodgers was born in Middlesbrough, England. He played bass for a band named The Roadrunners. Colin Bradley originally had the lead vocal slot, but convinced Rodgers to sing and front the band as Colin was primarily interested in playing rhythm guitar and his oldest brother Joe (who managed the band) supported the idea. Just before leaving Middlesbrough for the London music scene, the band changed its name to The Wildflowers. Other members of the band were Micky Moody (later of Whitesnake) and Bruce Thomas (later of Elvis Costello and The Attractions).

==Free==

In 1968, Rodgers joined bluesy rockers Free as singer and songwriter. In 1970, they shot up the international radio charts with &quot;All Right Now&quot;, which Rodgers wrote with the group&#x27;s bassist Andy Fraser. It was a number one hit in more than 20 territories and acknowledged by ASCAP in 1990 for having received over a million radio plays in the US.

For a short time, Free were alongside Led Zeppelin as among the highest grossing British acts, though Free&#x27;s status was not sustained. Free released four albums with a combination of blues, ballads and rock which were Top Five successes in the UK. When in 2000, the song &quot;All Right Now&quot; achieved the mark of two million radio plays in the UK, an award was given to Rodgers as one of the two writers.

After the first break-up of Free in the spring of 1971, Rodgers briefly formed a three-piece band called Peace. Alongside bassist Stewart McDonald and drummer Mick Underwood, Rodgers played guitar and sang lead vocals. Peace supported Mott the Hoople&#x27;s UK tour in 1971, but broke up when Free reformed at the start of 1972. Two songs by Peace were eventually included on the fifth disc of the 2000 Free compilation &quot;Songs of Yesterday&quot;, along with a song that Rodgers recorded with the Maytals. A bootleg has circulated of a 22 December 1971 appearance by Peace, live in studio, on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; program.

==1970s: Bad Company==
Rodgers formed his next band, Bad Company, with Mick Ralphs, former guitarist of Mott the Hoople. The line-up also included Free drummer Simon Kirke, and Boz Burrell, former vocalist and bassist of King Crimson. Rodgers said that he and Ralphs were still trying to come up with a name for the band, &quot;and I just said &#x27;Bad Company&#x27;, and there was this scuffling noise and he said, &#x27;Sh_, I dropped the phone—that&#x27;s it!

Bad Company was the first act signed to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s new record label, Swan Song. They toured from 1973 to 1982, and had several hits including &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;, &quot;Shooting Star&quot;, &quot;Bad Company&quot;, and &quot;Run with the Pack&quot;. Rodgers played instruments on several tracks: &quot;Bad Company&quot; and &quot;Run with the Pack&quot; featured him on piano; &quot;Rock and Roll Fantasy&quot; on guitar; and on the ballad &quot;Seagull&quot; Rodgers played all of the instruments. Bad Company earned six platinum albums until Rodgers left in 1982, stating that he wanted to spend time with his young family.

It was revealed in April 2011 that after Jim Morrison&#x27;s death in 1971, the rest of The Doors wanted Rodgers to replace him. Robby Krieger flew to England to personally offer him the job. However, Rodgers has said that he was off the grid in a very rural area at the time, and the moment passed. In late 1973, Rodgers was asked to become the singer of Deep Purple when Ian Gillan had left the band. He rejected their offer in order to start Bad Company.

==1980s: Solo career and the Firm==

In October 1983, Rodgers released his first solo LP &quot;Cut Loose&quot;. He composed all of the music and played all of the instruments. The album reached number 135 on Billboard&#x27;s Pop Albums chart.

When his friend Jimmy Page started to come around to his house, guitar in hand and Led Zeppelin at an end, the duo&#x27;s first live pairing was on the US ARMS (Action Research into Multiple Sclerosis) Tour, which had first been mooted by Eric Clapton and besides Rodgers and Page included Jeff Beck, Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood and others. The inspiration behind ARMS had been former Small Faces/Faces member Ronnie Lane&#x27;s own struggle with MS. That led to Rodgers and Page&#x27;s further teaming in the group The Firm, which resulted in two albums and two tours. Critics&#x27; reception of the band was sometimes scathing (one review used the term &quot;supersludge&quot;) and also mixed. 
Even so, the Firm&#x27;s two albums, &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;Mean Business&quot;, achieved moderate sales success and produced the radio hits &quot;Radioactive&quot;, &quot;Satisfaction Guaranteed&quot;, and, in the UK, &quot;All The King&#x27;s Horses&quot;.

During that same period, a series of albums were produced called &quot;Willie and the Poor Boys.&quot; Rodgers and Page were briefly part of this and recorded &quot;These Arms of Mine&quot;, an Otis Redding tune. The recording also became a video promoting the CD.

==1990s: The Law and solo career==
The Law, Rodgers&#x27; 1991 musical venture with former the Who and Faces drummer Kenney Jones, produced &quot;Billboard&quot; number one AOR chart hit &quot;Laying Down the Law&quot; written by Rodgers, but the album peaked at number 126 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. A second album can be found on the bootleg market, which is often referred to as &quot;The Law II&quot;. It is believed that this collection of songs were leftovers from the first album. Rodgers acknowledged the influence of Jimi Hendrix by collaborating with Steve Vai, Hendrix&#x27;s Band of Gypsys (Buddy Miles and Billy Cox) and the London Metropolitan Orchestra and recording the track &quot;Bold As Love&quot;, on the Hendrix tribute album &quot;In From The Storm&quot;. Then Rodgers teamed with Journey guitarist Neal Schon and drummer Deen Castronovo for his release &quot;The Hendrix Set&quot;, a live 5-track CD, recorded in 1993 with Rodgers&#x27; interpretations of Hendrix songs. A Canadian and US tour followed. His Grammy-nominated solo CD, &quot;Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters&quot; was released in 1993. Rodgers wrote the title track and was backed by guitarists Brian May, Gary Moore, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, Steve Miller, Buddy Guy, Richie Sambora, Brian Setzer, Slash, Neal Schon, and Trevor Rabin.

For Woodstock&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1994, Rodgers pulled together drummer Jason Bonham, bassist Andy Fraser (from Free), guitarists Slash and Schon at the last moment to perform as the Paul Rodgers Rock and Blues Revue. In 1995, he formed a new band consisting of Jaz Lochrie on bass, Jimmy Copley on drums and Geoff Whitehorn on guitar. The band (The Paul Rodgers Band) toured extensively in Europe, US and in the UK until 1998 and released three albums – &quot;&quot;, &quot;Now&quot; and &quot;Electric&quot;. &quot;Now&quot; charted internationally in the Top 40. The single &quot;Soul of Love&quot; remained in rotation on more than 86 US radio stations for six months but was not a sales success. His 1997 world tour included Russia, Japan, Canada, US, UK, Germany, France, Romania, Bulgaria, Israel, Brazil, Greece and Argentina.

Rodgers and Bad Company were on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s US BDS charts with the number one single &quot;Hey, Hey&quot; in 1999, one of four new tracks off Bad Company&#x27;s &quot;The &#x27;Original&#x27; Bad Co. Anthology&quot;. The second single release, Rodgers&#x27;s &quot;Hammer of Love&quot;, reached number two. For the first time in 20 years, all the original members of Bad Company toured the US.

==2000s: Solo career, Queen and Bad Company reunion==

Rodgers focused on his solo career in 2000 and released &quot;Electric&quot;, his sixth solo CD. In its debut week, the single &quot;Drifters&quot; was US rock radio&#x27;s number one on the &quot;Most Added FMQB Hot Trax&quot; list, number two on &quot;Most Added R&amp;R Rock&quot; and number three on &quot;Most Added Album Net Power Cuts&quot;. &quot;Drifters&quot; remained in the top 10 for eight weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Rock charts. Also in 2000, he played sold-out concerts in England, Scotland, Australia, the United States, and Canada. After his appearance on TV&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in New York, he met and jammed with B. B. King. In the same year, Rodgers, Jimmie Vaughan, Levon Helm, bluesmen Hubert Sumlin, Johnnie Johnson, James Cotton and others performed a sold out concert in Cleveland, Ohio as a &quot;Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters&quot;. In spring 2001, Rodgers returned to Australia, England and Scotland for the second run of sold-out shows. That summer he toured the US with Bad Company.

Rodgers and Bad Company released their first official live CD and DVD, &quot;In Concert: Merchants of Cool&quot;, in 2002. It included all the hits and a new single, &quot;Joe Fabulous&quot;, penned by Rodgers, which hit number one at Classic Rock Radio and Top 20 on mainstream rock radio in the US. In its debut week, the DVD sales sound scanned at number three Canada, and number four in the US. The Joe Fabulous Tour kicked off in the US and sold out in the UK. While in London, Rodgers performed with Jeff Beck at the Royal Festival Hall. Rodgers was invited by long-time fan Tony Blair to perform at the Labour Party Conference. &quot;I had the entire Labour Party singing the chorus of &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, a song I wrote and shared with Free, ...&#x27;love in a peaceful world&#x27;. &#x27;Love in a peaceful world&#x27;... over and over and over hoping the words would sink in but we went to war&quot; recalled Rodgers. Twice in 2002, Rodgers performed on Britain&#x27;s TV show &quot;Top of the Pops 2&quot;.

In 2003, Rodgers toured as a solo artist for the first time in two years playing 25 US dates. In his solo band were guitarist Howard Leese (formerly of Heart), bassist Lynn Sorensen, and drummer Jeff Kathan. Jools Holland invited Rodgers to record &quot;I Told The Truth&quot; for Holland&#x27;s album &quot;Small World Big Band&quot;. The CD also featured Eric Clapton, Ronnie Wood, Peter Gabriel, Michael McDonald, Ringo Starr and others. That led to Rodgers performing two sold-out nights at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall with Holland and his 18-piece rhythm and blues orchestra, and several UK TV appearances. He also appeared with Jeff Beck, performing some songs from Beck&#x27;s back catalogue (along with several other notable musicians including John McLaughlin, Roger Waters, and The White Stripes ) for part of a week-long series of charity concerts put on by Jeff Beck at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

Early in 2004, Rodgers joined Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox (Hendrix&#x27;s Cry of Love), Buddy Guy, Joe Satriani, Kid Rock&#x27;s Kenny Olson, Alice in Chains&#x27; Jerry Cantrell, Double Trouble, Indigenous, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and blues legend Hubert Sumlin (Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters) and performed three sold-out shows in Seattle, Portland and San Francisco as &quot;Experience Hendrix&quot;. Once again, Rodgers only played 25 concerts in the US and Canada. He performed at Wembley for the fiftieth anniversary celebration for the Fender Stratocaster, along with David Gilmour who played Strat No. 001, Ronnie Wood, Brian May, Joe Walsh and Gary Moore. Rodgers sang and played a custom designed Jaguar Fender Strat. He was invited by the Four Tops to be part of their fiftieth anniversary TV/DVD concert celebration at Motown&#x27;s Opera House and performed alongside Aretha Franklin, Dennis Edwards &amp; The Temptations Revue, Sam Moore, Mary Wilson, Ashford &amp; Simpson, and the Four Tops. 
In late 2004, after a successful live television performance, two of the three living members of the British rock group Queen proposed a collaboration with Rodgers, in which he would sing lead vocals on a European tour. Rodgers thus joined Brian May and Roger Taylor (former bassist John Deacon retired in the late 1990s), with the group billed as Queen + Paul Rodgers and they subsequently toured worldwide in 2005 and 2006. The participants clearly said, including on Brian May&#x27;s own website, &quot;that Rodgers would be &quot;featured with&quot; Queen as: &quot;Queen + Paul Rodgers&quot;, not replacing the late Freddie Mercury&quot;. The group then released a live album with songs from Queen, Bad Company and Free, called &quot;Return of the Champions&quot;, and a DVD of the same name. Both featured live recordings from their Sheffield Hallam FM Arena concert on 9 May 2005. The DVD features &quot;Imagine&quot; from Hyde Park. &quot;For one glorious summer&quot; opined music critic Sean Michaels &quot;we were all Paul Rodgers&quot;. Another DVD was released in 2006 from a live performance in Japan, called &quot;Super Live in Japan&quot;.

Queen + Paul Rodgers also released a single featuring &quot;Reaching Out&quot;, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; and &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;. In the summer of 2006, Rodgers again focused on his solo career with a world tour, which commenced in Austin, Texas in June, went to Japan, and ending in Glasgow, Scotland, in October 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website that &quot;Queen + Paul Rodgers&quot; would begin producing a new studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at Roger Taylor&#x27;s home. In April 2007 Rodgers released a live album of his 2006 tour, &quot;Live in Glasgow&quot;, recorded in Glasgow on 13 October 2006, with a DVD of the same show released the next month. On 27–28 December 2007, Rodgers performed with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra during their Winter 2007 Tour in Houston and Dallas. Unannounced, he joined the band at the end of their show to sing &quot;Bad Company&quot; and &quot;All Right Now&quot;. Rogers was a judge for the sixth and seventh annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.

On 27 June 2008, Rodgers and Queen performed at the Concert for Nelson Mandela to celebrate Mandela&#x27;s 90th birthday. On 8 August 2008, Rodgers and original members Mick Ralphs and Simon Kirke reunited as Bad Company to perform a one-night only, sold-out performance at the Seminole Hard Rock Live in Hollywood, Florida. The live performance was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and CD on 9 February 2010 and the tracks included seventeen Bad Company hits. Rodgers dedicated &quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot; to original bassist Boz Burrell, who died in 2006.

On 14 May 2009, Rodgers announced that he was ending his five-year-long collaboration with Queen, although he did not rule out the possibility of working with them again. On 17 November 2009, it was announced he would join the other surviving members of Bad Company for an eight-date UK tour in April 2010.

==2010s: Solo career and more Bad Company==
From 5 June 2010 to 18 June 2010 Rodgers and his band were on a small tour of California. They performed at the Temecula Valley Balloon &amp; Wine Festival. One week later, on 12 June, Rodgers and his band went to appeared as headliners on the Grandstand Stage at the San Diego County Fair in Del Mar, California, followed by casino shows in Lemoore on 17 June and in Santa Ynez on 18 June. Rodgers performed a solo UK tour in April 2011 with Joe Elliot&#x27;s Down &#x27;n&#x27; Outz. The concert of 28 April at Birmingham&#x27;s National Indoor Arena was filmed for a future live DVD release. In May 2011 Rodgers received an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Outstanding contribution to British music&quot;

Rodgers announced that he would be taking part in a Paul McCartney tribute album which has contributions by Billy Joel, Garth Brooks, B. B. King, and KISS. Originally planned for a late 2010 release, the album, entitled &quot;The Art of McCartney&quot;, was released in late 2014. Rodgers&#x27; contribution is a cover of the Wings song &quot;Let Me Roll It&quot;, originally from their 1973 album &quot;Band on the Run&quot;. In 2014, he toured again with Bad Company. He performed again with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra on their New Year&#x27;s Eve show in Seattle. He performed Can&#x27;t Get Enough and All Right Now.

In 2017 Rodgers embarked on a &#x27;Free Spirit&#x27; UK Tour in May 2017 to celebrate the music of Free by performing songs strictly from the Free catalogue. He said &quot;It was 50 years ago in 1967 when Paul Kossoff and I met and later formed Free&quot;. In 2018 a CD/DVD set was released which recorded the final show from the &#x27;Free Spirit&#x27; tour; it was filmed at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 May 2017. In the summer of 2018 Rodgers toured with Jeff Beck. In 2023, he released the album &quot;Midnight Rose&quot;, his first solo album of original material in 24 years. He said in an interview with Eddie Trunk that he had no plans to tour in support of it.

==Personal life==
Rodgers became a Canadian citizen on 21 October 2011 and lives in British Columbia.

===Relationships and family===
Rodgers has a daughter, Natalie, from an early relationship, who lives in his hometown of Middlesbrough. Paul Rodgers married Machiko Shimizu in 1971 and they have two children, Steve and Jasmine. Both children are musicians, known for being members of the rock band Bôa. Paul Rodgers and Shimizu divorced in 1996.

In 2007, Rodgers married Cynthia Kereluk, a former Miss Canada, with whom he&#x27;d been in a relationship since 1997.

<doc id="269515" wikidata="Q555370" url="?curid=269515" title="Ed McMahon">
<text>Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. (March 6, 1923 – June 23, 2009) was an American announcer, game show host, comedian, actor, singer, and combat aviator. McMahon and Johnny Carson began their association in their first TV series, the ABC game show &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot;, running from 1957 to 1962. McMahon then made his famous thirty-year mark as Carson&#x27;s sidekick and announcer on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; from 1962 to 1992.

McMahon also hosted the original &quot;Star Search&quot; from 1983 to 1995, co-hosted &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes&quot; with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998, presented sweepstakes for American Family Publishers, annually co-hosted the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; from 1973 to 2008 and anchored the team of NBC personalities conducting the network&#x27;s coverage of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade during the 1970s and 80s.

McMahon appeared in several films, including &quot;The Incident&quot;, &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, &quot;Full Moon High&quot; and &quot;Butterfly.&quot; He had a brief screen time in the film version of the TV sitcom &quot;Bewitched&quot; and also performed in numerous television commercials. According to the staff of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, McMahon tops the list of the &quot;50 greatest sidekicks ever&quot;.

==Early years==
Ed McMahon was born on March 6, 1923, in Detroit, Michigan, to Edward Leo Peter McMahon Sr. (a fund-raiser and an entertainer), and Eleanor (Russell) McMahon. He was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts, often visiting his paternal Aunt Mary (Brennan) at her home on Chelmsford Street. McMahon worked for three years as a carnival barker in Mexico, Maine, before serving as a fifteen-year-old bingo caller in the state. He put himself through college as a pitchman for vegetable slicers on the Atlantic City boardwalk. He landed his first broadcasting job at WLLH-AM in Lowell, and his television career launched in Philadelphia at WCAU-TV.

===Military service===
McMahon hoped to become a United States Marine Corps fighter pilot. Prior to the US entry into World War II, both the Army and Navy required pilot candidates to attend at least two years of college. McMahon studied at Boston College from 1940 to 1941. On &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in 2001, he stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement remained in effect and he still had to finish his two years of college before applying for Marine Corps flight training.

After completing the college requirement, McMahon began his primary flight training in Dallas. This was followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications and was designated as a Naval Aviator. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor in F4U Corsair fighters for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific Fleet in 1945. However,the orders were canceled after the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

As an officer in the Marine Corps Reserve, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. He flew an OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the unarmed single-engine Cessna O-1 Bird Dog) spotter plane, serving as an artillery spotter for Marine artillery batteries and a forward air controller for Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he remained in the Marine Corps Reserve, retiring in 1966 as a Colonel. In 1982, McMahon received a state commission as a Brigadier General in the California Air National Guard, an honorary award to recognize his support for the National Guard and Reserves.

===The Catholic University of America===
After World War II, McMahon studied at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., under the GI Bill and graduated in 1949. He majored in speech and drama while studying under Gilbert Hartke and was a member of the Phi Kappa Theta fraternity. After graduation, McMahon led the effort to raise funds for a theater to be named for Hartke and attended its dedication in 1970 with Helen Hayes and Sidney Poitier. While working as Carson&#x27;s sidekick during &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, McMahon served as the president of the national alumni association from 1967 to 1971 and would often return to campus, especially for homecoming. During the university&#x27;s centennial celebration in 1987, McMahon and Bob Newhart performed. He received an honorary Doctor of Communication Arts in 1988.

&quot;I owe so much to CU,&quot; McMahon once said. &quot;That&#x27;s where my career got its start.&quot; Today, the Ed McMahon Endowed Scholarship helps outstanding students and provides scholarship assistance to juniors and seniors who are pursuing a bachelor&#x27;s degree in either the Department of Drama or the Department of Media Studies within the School of Arts and Sciences.

==Entertainment career==

===&quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot;===
McMahon and Carson first worked together as announcer and host on the ABC daytime game show &quot;Who Do You Trust?&quot; running from 1957 to 1962. He describes the pair&#x27;s first meeting as being &quot;about as exciting as watching a traffic light change&quot;.

===&quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;===

McMahon rejoined Carson for &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on October 1, 1962, on NBC. For almost 30 years, McMahon introduced the show with a drawn-out &quot;Heeeeeeeeeeere&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; His booming voice and constant laughter alongside the &quot;King of Late Night&quot; earned McMahon the nickname the &quot;Human Laugh Track&quot; and &quot;Toymaker to the King&quot;. As part of the introductory patter to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, McMahon would state his name out loud, pronouncing it as , but neither long-time cohort Carson nor anyone else who interviewed him ever seemed to pick up on that subtlety, usually pronouncing his name .

Aside from his co-hosting duties, it also fell upon McMahon during the early years of Carson&#x27;s tenure (when the show ran 105 minutes) to host the first fifteen minutes of &quot;Tonight&quot;, which did not air nationally. McMahon also served as guest host on at least one occasion, substituting for Carson during a week of programs that aired between July 29 and August 2, 1963, and again for two nights in October 1963. The gregarious McMahon served as a counter to the notoriously shy Carson. Nonetheless, McMahon once told an interviewer that after his many decades as an emcee, he would still get &quot;butterflies&quot; in his stomach every time he would walk onto a stage and would use that nervousness as a source of energy.

His famous opening line &quot;Heeere&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; was used in the 1980 horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; by the character Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) as he goes after his wife and child with an axe. McMahon did in-program commercials for many sponsors of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, most notably Budweiser beer and Alpo dog food, and also did commercials for them that ran on other programs.

===&quot;Star Search&quot;===
McMahon was also host of the successful weekly syndicated series &quot;Star Search&quot;, which began in 1983 and helped launch the careers of numerous actors, singers, choreographers and comedians. He stayed with the show until it ended in 1995 and in 2003, he made a cameo appearance on the CBS revival of the series, hosted by his successor Arsenio Hall.

===Other roles===
His long association with brewer Anheuser-Busch earned him the nickname &quot;Mr. Budweiser&quot; and he used that relationship to bring them aboard as one of the largest corporate donors to the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Beginning in 1973, McMahon served as co-host of the long-running live annual Labor Day weekend event of the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot;. His 41st and final appearance on that show was in 2008, making him second only to Jerry Lewis himself in number. McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) &quot;TV&#x27;s Bloopers and Practical Jokes&quot; on NBC from 1982 to 1993.

In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film &quot;The Incident&quot; and appeared as Santa Claus on &quot;The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show&quot;. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as &quot;communicator&quot; (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of &quot;Monitor&quot;, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the NBC Radio Network. The 1955 movie &quot;Dementia&quot;, which has music without dialogue, was released as &quot;Daughter of Horror&quot; in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; in 1977.

He then played himself in &quot;Remote Control Man&quot;, a season one episode of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. In 2004, McMahon became the announcer and co-host of &quot;Alf&#x27;s Hit Talk Show&quot; on TV Land. He authored two memoirs, &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny!: My Memories of Johnny Carson, The Tonight Show, and 46 Years of Friendship&quot; as well as &quot;For Laughing Out Loud&quot;. Over the years, he emceed the game shows &quot;Missing Links&quot;, &quot;Snap Judgment&quot;, &quot;Concentration&quot;, and &quot;Whodunnit!&quot;.

McMahon also hosted &quot;Lifestyles Live&quot;, a weekend talk program aired on the USA Radio Network. Additionally, he also appeared in the feature documentary film, &quot;Pitch People&quot;, the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of Neighborhood Watch public service announcements parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted &quot;prize patrol&quot;.) 

McMahon was originally hired to appear in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; and do the infamous fight scene with Adam Sandler, but according to Sandler, McMahon changed his mind after finding out about the movie&#x27;s crude humor and so McMahon was replaced by Bob Barker.

Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a FreeCreditReport.com commercial and in a &quot;Cash4Gold&quot; commercial alongside MC Hammer. McMahon was also the spokesman for Pride Mobility, a leading power wheelchair and scooter manufacturer. His final film appearance was in the independent John Hughes themed rom-com &quot;Jelly&quot; as Mr. Closure alongside actress Natasha Lyonne. Mostly in the 1980s through the 1990s, McMahon was the spokesperson for Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company.

==Personal life==

===Marriage and children===

McMahon married Alyce Ferrell on July 5, 1945, while he was serving as a flight instructor in the Marines. The couple had four children: Claudia (b. 1946), Michael Edward (1951–1995), Linda, and Jeffrey. They separated in 1972 and divorced in 1974. McMahon married Victoria Valentine on March 6, 1976. They adopted their daughter Katherine Mary in 1985. The couple divorced in 1989. McMahon paid $50,000 per month in spousal and child support. On February 22, 1992, three months before his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; run came to a close, in a ceremony held near Las Vegas, McMahon married 37-year-old Pamela &quot;Pam&quot; Hurn, who had a son named Alex. McMahon&#x27;s daughter Katherine served as best person at the wedding. McMahon was a longtime summer resident of Avalon, New Jersey.

===Financial problems===
In June 2008, it was announced that McMahon was $644,000 behind on payments on $4.8 million in mortgage loans and was fighting to avoid foreclosure on his multimillion-dollar Beverly Hills home. McMahon was also sued by Citibank for $180,000. McMahon appeared on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; on June 5, 2008, with his wife to talk about this situation. In the interview, McMahon&#x27;s wife Pam said that people assumed that the McMahons had a lot of money because of his celebrity status. Pamela McMahon also commented that they do not have &quot;millions&quot; of dollars. On July 30, 2008, McMahon&#x27;s financial status suffered another blow. McMahon failed to pay divorce attorney Norman Solovay $275,168, according to a lawsuit filed in the Manhattan federal court. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, had hired Solovay to represent Linda Schmerge, his daughter from his first marriage, in a &quot;matrimonial matter&quot;, said Solovay&#x27;s lawyer, Michael Shanker.

On August 14, 2008, real estate mogul Donald Trump announced that he would purchase McMahon&#x27;s home from Countrywide Financial and lease it to McMahon, so the home would not be foreclosed. McMahon agreed instead to a deal with a private buyer for his hilltop home, said Howard Bragman, McMahon&#x27;s former spokesman. Bragman declined to name the buyer or the selling price, but he said it was not Trump. In early September, after the second buyer&#x27;s offer fell through, Trump renewed his offer to purchase the home. Trump never followed through with either of his public offers to purchase the residence, per McMahon&#x27;s daughter Claudia McMahon. 

===Health problems===

On April 20, 2002, McMahon sued his insurance company for more than $20 million, alleging that he was sickened by toxic mold that spread through his Beverly Hills house after contractors failed to properly clean up water damage from a broken pipe. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, became ill from the mold, as did members of their household staff, according to the Los Angeles County Superior Court suit. The McMahons blamed the mold for the death of the family dog, Muffin. Their suit, one of many in recent years over toxic mold, was filed against American Equity Insurance Co., a pair of insurance adjusters, and several environmental cleanup contractors. It sought monetary damages for alleged breach of contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

On March 21, 2003, the long legal battle ended with McMahon being awarded $7.2 million from several companies who were negligent for allowing toxic mold into his home, sickening him and his wife and killing their dog. In March 2007, McMahon was injured in a fall and, in March 2008, it was announced he was recovering from a broken neck and two subsequent surgeries. He later sued Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and two doctors claiming fraud, battery, elder abuse, and emotional distress, and accused them of discharging him with a broken neck after his fall and botching two later neck surgeries.

On February 27, 2009, it was reported that McMahon had been in an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital (later confirmed as Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center) for almost a month. He was listed in serious condition and was in the intensive care unit. His publicist told reporters that he was admitted for pneumonia at the time, but could not confirm nor deny reports that McMahon had been diagnosed with bone cancer.

==Death==
McMahon died on June 23, 2009, shortly after midnight at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California. He was 86 years old. His nurse, Julie Koehne, stated he went peacefully. No formal cause of death was given, but McMahon&#x27;s publicist attributed his death to the many health problems he had suffered over his final months. McMahon had said that he still suffered from his neck injury the past two years. His funeral was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.

==Tributes and legacy==
The night of McMahon&#x27;s death, Conan O&#x27;Brien paid him tribute on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;: 

He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television on March 20, 1986.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted McMahon into their Hall of Fame in 2010.

<text>Saint Rimbert (or Rembert) (&quot;c.&quot; 830 - 11 June 888 in Bremen) was archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen, in the northern part of the Kingdom of East Frankia from 865 until his death in 888. He most famously wrote the life of Saint Ansgar, the &quot;Vita Ansgari,&quot; one of the most popular hagiographies of the middle ages.

==Biography==
Little is directly known about Rimbert, much of the information available regarding his life comes from the &quot;Vita Rimberti&quot;, a hagiography written by an unknown author, likely produced some time in the 10th century. While his place of birth is uncertain it is widely accepted by historians that Rimbert was Danish. As a monk he trained in Turholt (Torhout), after which he shared a missionary trip to Scandinavia with his mentor Ansgar, Bishop of Hamburg. Upon Ansgar&#x27;s death in 865, Rimbert was unanimously elected Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen. Upon his election, Rimbert travelled with Bishop Theodric of Minden and Abbot Adalgar of Corvey to the court of Louis the German, who sent him to Archbishop Liudbert of Mainz to receive his consecration, which he received with the aid of Luidhard of Paderborn and Thoedric.

Rimbert continued much of the missionary work that had begun under Ansgar, despite the lack of royal or papal support for the missionary effort. As Archbishop, he maintained the poorhouse in Bremen that had been established by Ansgar and founded a monastery at Bücken. He also continued to preach to the Danes at Hedeby. Rimbert furthermore obtained market, coinage and toll rights for the city of Bremen in 888 from Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia and thus considerably improved the financial state of the archbishopric. In 884 he personally led a Frisian army against the Vikings, and following the victorious Battle of Norditi was able to drive them permanently out of East Frisia.

It was also chronicled in the &quot;Vita Rimberti&quot; that Rimbert had performed numerous miracles, many of which are associated with his missionary work in Sweden. The miracles attributed to him include calming stormy seas, restoring sight to the blind and in one instance, performing an exorcism on the son of Louis the German. While the &quot;Vita Rimberti&quot; claimed the importance of these miracles and the in the &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot;, Rimbert claimed that his and Ansgar&#x27;s missionary work was popular and successful, they nevertheless produced underwhelming results in converting the Scandinavians.

Rimbert is revered as a saint particularly in Frisia. His feast day is 4 February. After Ansgar, known as the &quot;Apostle of the North&quot;, Rimbert is revered as the &quot;Second Apostle of the North&quot;, alongside the missionary Sigfrid of Sweden.

In a highly notable letter from the controversial 9th century theologian, Ratramnus of Corbie, Ratramnus responded to a lost letter from Rimbert regarding the nature of cynocephali. In the letter, Ratramnus gave a response to an account received by Rimbert, while on a mission in Scandinavia. The account told of cynocephali living in the region and that they were living in organised communities. Rimbert had enquired if this in meant that the cynocephali were capable of reason and therefore are &#x27;arose from the line of Adam&#x27; making them human and eligible for Christian conversion. In his response, Ratramnus broke with the traditional understanding of cynocephali as animals or monsters and instead declared that they were indeed human and therefore should be converted. This letter highlights the beginning of the change of perception of cynocephali and by extension, Vikings, with whom they were intrinsically linked.

This understanding of cynocephali as human and therefore convertible had profound connotations for Rimbert. Not only was this continued justification for the conversion of his fellow Danes but also had profound prophetic implications. The apocalypse of pseudo-Methodius was one of the most widely read and popular accounts of the apocalypse in 9th century Europe, in which when all people had been converted to Christianity, the monstrous and barbaric people from the North would destroy the world. The prophetic and apocalyptic implications of his work to convert Scandinavian people was not lost Rimbert.

Furthermore, the letter is evident of political connection between the Ansgar and Rimbert and the monks of Corbie. Rimbert aligned himself with the monks at Corbie and sought patronage in West Frankia with Charles the Bald. Similarly, this alliance was underpinned by a common support for ideas of predestination and the ideas of the controversial monk Gotschalk of Orbais. This however, bought Rimbert into an ideological conflict with Hincmar of Rheims who vehemently opposed both ideas of predestination, the humanity of the Cynocephali and questioned the value of the missionary work in Scandinavia.

==Forged foundations of Hamburg-Bremen==
Prior to Rimbert&#x27;s election as Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen the archiepiscopal see of Hamburg-Bremen had not technically existed. Ansgar himself had forged the bishopric of Hamburg, claiming that he had been granted the position by Louis the Pious after he died, a claim uncontested by Louis the German. Ansgar later became an archbishop, though only a missionary archbishop, and such his episcopal see, Hamburg, was only that of a bishop not Archbishop. When Ansgar died and Rimbert assumed the archbishopric in 865, he understood that Hamburg was not large enough for an archiepiscopal see and the Archbishop of Cologne threatened to assert jurisdiction over Bremen, an area Ansgar had exercised some influence though to which he and Rimbert had no claim. This is apparent as several of the accounts that Rimbert gives of the earlier bestowals of the archdiocese are at odds with surviving documentary evidence. Rimbert needed to provide believable context for the forged documents that he and Ansgar used to claim the episcopal justification over Bremen as well as Hamburg. As such, Rimbert wove together in the &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot; justification for the continuation of the missionary work in Scandinavia and the authority that Ansgar had over Bremen, legitimising the episcopal see of Hamburg-Bremen.

<text>Free were an English rock band formed in London in 1968 by Paul Rodgers (vocals), Paul Kossoff (guitar), Andy Fraser (bass, piano) and Simon Kirke (drums, percussion). They are best known for their hit songs &quot;All Right Now&quot; and &quot;Wishing Well&quot;. Although renowned for their live performances and non-stop touring, their music did not sell well until their third studio album, &quot;Fire and Water&quot; (1970), which featured the hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;. The song helped secure them a performance at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, where they played to an audience of 600,000 people. In the early 1970s they became one of the best-selling British blues rock groups; by the time they disbanded, they had sold more than 20 million records worldwide and had played in more than 700 arenas and festival concerts. &quot;All Right Now&quot; remains a staple of R&amp;B and rock, and has entered ASCAP&#x27;s &quot;One Million&quot; airplay singles club.

Andy Fraser left the band in 1972 and formed Sharks. Free recorded one more album, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, before disbanding in 1973; Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke went on to co-form the more successful rock supergroup Bad Company. Paul Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler in 1973, but died from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 25 in 1976. Andy Fraser died on 16 March 2015 at 62.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has referred to the band as &quot;British hard rock pioneers&quot;. The magazine ranked Rodgers No. 55 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;, and Kossoff at No. 51 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Free were signed to Island Records in the UK and A&amp;M Records in North America.

== History ==

=== Formation, early years and breakthrough ===
Paul Kossoff and Simon Kirke became friends while in the R&amp;B band Black Cat Bones, but they wanted to move on. When Kossoff saw Paul Rodgers singing with his band Brown Sugar at the Fickle Pickle, an R&amp;B club in London&#x27;s Finsbury Park, he was immediately impressed and asked to jam onstage with Rodgers. Along with Kirke, they began the search for a fourth member. Alexis Korner recommended Andy Fraser, who had been playing with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. Korner also provided the name &quot;Free&quot; to the new band.

The group played their first gig on 19 April 1968 at the Nag&#x27;s Head pub, at the junction of York Road and Plough Road in Battersea, London. They were all teenagers – bass player Fraser was 15 years old, lead guitarist Kossoff was 17, and lead singer Rodgers and drummer Kirke were 18. By November they had recorded their first album, &quot;Tons of Sobs&quot;, for Island Records, it being released in March 1969. The album documented their first six months together and contains studio renditions of much of their early live set. To promote the forthcoming album they opened some shows at the end of 1968 for the Who, who played a short theatre tour with Arthur Brown.

The group&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Free&quot;, was recorded and released in 1969 on Island Records. While their first two albums were not greatly successful, their third album &quot;Fire and Water&quot;, released in 1970, was a huge success, largely due to its hit single &quot;All Right Now&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the UK singles chart and No. 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album reached No. 2 in the UK charts and No. 17 on the U.S charts, making it the most successful Free album. &quot;All Right Now&quot; became a No. 1 hit in over 20 territories and was recognised by ASCAP in 1990 for garnering 1 million plus radio plays in the US by late 1989. In 2000 an award was given to Paul Rodgers by the British Music Industry when &quot;All Right Now&quot; passed 2 million radio plays in the UK. 

Despite its name, Free was the only advertised band who would not perform for free for the ailing Phun City festival in July 1970. Promoter Mick Farren said that when they learned there would be no payment, they left &quot;without even getting out of the car.&quot; Kirke&#x27;s replacement in Black Cat&#x27;s Bones, Phil Lenoir, played the festival as drummer for Shagrat.

&quot;Highway&quot; was their fourth studio album, recorded extremely quickly in September 1970. It performed poorly in the charts, reaching No. 41 in the UK and No. 190 in the US.

In April 1971 they released the single &quot;My Brother Jake&quot;, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart and remained in the chart for 11 weeks. It was described by Dave Thompson of AllMusic as a &quot;gorgeous knockabout&quot; of a song. &quot;Record World&quot; said it was &quot;their best since &#x27;Alright Now&#x27;.&quot; The band performed the song on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 13 May 1971.

=== First break-up, reformation, and final break-up ===
The band disbanded in 1971 because of differences between Fraser and Rodgers, who felt he was not being listened to. This led to the release of the live album called &quot;Free Live!&quot; In early 1972 the band set aside their differences and reformed in an effort to save Kossoff from his growing drug addiction, and released &quot;Free at Last&quot; in June of the same year.

Fraser left the band in mid-1972, frustrated by Kossoff&#x27;s unreliability at being able to perform at shows or even at showing up. The remaining members recruited Japanese bass player Tetsu Yamauchi and keyboardist John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick, who had worked with Kossoff and Kirke during Free&#x27;s initial split, recording &quot;Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit&quot; and recorded what would be Free&#x27;s final album, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. Kossoff was replaced by ex-Osibisa guitarist Wendell Richardson for a US tour in 1973, but shortly thereafter Free disbanded for good. Rodgers and Kirke went on to form Bad Company, Fraser formed Sharks and later the Andy Fraser Band, and Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler.

=== After Free ===
With Kossoff in better health again in late 1975, he was delighted that ex-colleagues Rodgers and Kirke asked him to join them on stage for two nights. A British tour was set to begin on 25 April 1976 with Back Street Crawler headlining with Bad Company in support of Back Street Crawler&#x27;s second album, but again Kossoff&#x27;s drug addictions contributed to a drastic decline in the guitarist&#x27;s health. On a flight from Los Angeles to New York City on 19 March 1976, Kossoff died from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 25.

After parting with Bad Company in 1982, Rodgers went on to explore the heavy blues stylings of Free again in his solo career during the 1980s and 1990s, and in the bands The Firm and The Law. Subsequently, he teamed up as vocalist with two of the three remaining members of Queen (Brian May, John Deacon and Roger Taylor). In September 2008, Queen + Paul Rodgers released their first studio album &quot;The Cosmos Rocks&quot;. Rodgers also performed Free and Bad Company songs while on tour with Queen, in addition to the traditional Queen songs and new cuts from their most recently released album.

Rodgers and Kirke toured again with Bad Company from 2012 to 2016. Andy Fraser died on 16 March 2015. In 2017, Paul Rodgers embarked on a Free Spirit UK Tour in May 2017 to celebrate the music of Free by performing songs strictly from the Free catalogue. In 2019 Bad Company reformed to tour in support of the first leg on Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s Last Of The Street Survivors Tour.

<text>The Vita Ansgarii, also known as the Vita Anskarii, is the hagiography of saint Ansgar, written by Rimbert, his successor as archbishop in the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. The &quot;Vita&quot; is an important source not only in detailing Ansgar&#x27;s Scandinavian missionary work, but also in its descriptions of the everyday lives of people during the Viking Age.

== Date ==
The &quot;Vita Anskarii&quot; was written sometime between the years 869 and 876.

== Author ==
Not much is known about Rimbert&#x27;s life, the main source being the &quot;Vita Rimberrti&quot;, written 865–909. Rimbert was likely brought up at the monastery at Turnhout in Flanders. His training as a monk was focused on missionary work.

Rimbert&#x27;s early years residing in Flanders may explain why he shared such a strong passion for missionary work in the North. Like his predecessor, he may also have had Scandinavian origins, compelling him to save his people. Rimbert died in 888 which meant the missions to Scandinavia collapsed.

=== Rimbert and Anskar ===
Anskar was Rimbert&#x27;s predecessor as Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen.The diocese of Hamburg and Bremen had been unified in 845. Pope Leo IV was eager for more missionary work to take place but Anskar was nearing death and wrote about the missions to preserve their memory. Rimbert uses Anskar as a unifying saint of the newly binded archbishopric.

The &quot;Vita Rimberrti&quot; suggests Rimbert joined Anskar and Ebbo of Rheims on missionary whilst he was a young man and still residing at Turnhout in Flanders although the truthfulness of this has been debated by historians.

== Literary context ==
The &quot;Vita Anskarii&quot; is a hagiographical text. Hagiography generally tends to be an idealised account, focusing only on the positive aspects of the saint&#x27;s life. Although the genre of the piece is a hagiography the actual text contains a ‘multiplicity of forms’.

It also cannot be seen as a factual biographical work. Instead, its importance derives from its ability to show us the concerns and thoughts of Rimbert over ‘predestination, divine retribution and the rewards in showing consistency to faith imbued throughout&#x27;.

== Carolingian missionary work ==
In the text, missionary work is closely linked to Ebbo of Rheims and Rimbert presents Ebbo as a model alongside Anskar. Ebbo was involved in the earlier Carolingian missions under emperor Louis the Pious and initially had success with conversion of King Harald in 826. Ebbo’s deposition led to lack of influence for missionaries in the North at the courts of Carolingian rulers. After he betrayed Louis the Pious and was replaced with Hincmar of Rheims there was no further widespread push for their importance which limited resources to pursue missions.

Anskar and Rimbert’s attempts to bring the Christian faith to the North were largely unsuccessful long term. However, historian Nancy Wicker has stated the missions did have an impact. By looking at finds of female remains at the site at Birka, archeologists reported them wearing ‘crosses, crucifixes and open-work cross keys.’ She argues that they were most likely to have been targeted first for conversion as women were viewed as having the responsibility to bring up their children and thus spread the Christian message.

The Vita Anskarii was linked to the works of Paschasius Radbertus, who saw missions as fulfillment of the scripture. Rimbert and Anskar wanted to understand pagan religion and refute it intellectually, not through the use of force. The text also highlights the significant decline of interest that Louis the German and his East Frankish Kingdom had in funding missionary work to the North.

== Functions of the text ==
Hagiographies could often alter the truth to project a message. The &quot;Vita Anskarii&quot; does this in two main ways. The text presents a theological message by harnessing visions and miracles to present the ideas of predestination, divine retribution and the reward of consistent faith. The miracles described in the text therefore were used to convince priests that God would protect them on what could be dangerous missions into the North. This hagiographical text also is political as it defends the union of Hamburg and Bremen. It places the unification roughly halfway through the text and frames it as a successful diocese. The archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen was seen as an inferior archbishopric so it was difficult for Rimbert to obtain support from the Eastern Franks.

The different functions of the text are linked by the desire to continue missions and obtain help from the Western Franks. The text was directed at the monastery of Corbie, a natural place to garner support as Anskar had been a monk there. Corbie was also closely linked with the Carolingian dynasty. Charles the Bald, king of West Francia was therefore potentially a more fruitful target for obtaining resources to aid with missionary work.

Another function of the text was to reassure priests on what they were to expect on a mission. The text also defends missionary work to monks who lived under the Rule of Saint Benedict and would have needed justification to leave their monastery which warned against going into the secular world.

== Legacy of the text==
Whilst Rimbert was penning the &quot;Vita&quot;, enthusiasm for missionary work from secular and ecclesiastical leaders was uncommon. Therefore, Rimbert wanted to use the saint&#x27;s life to encourage priests to go on missions and for bishops to supply funds to support the cause. However, due to sustained Viking attacks, Scandinavians became increasingly unpopular in the 880s which further deadened enthusiasm to convert Northmen. The death of Rimbert in 888 signified the collapse of Carolingian efforts to convert.

<text>Raymond&quot;Boz&quot;Burrell (1 August 1946 – 21 September 2006) was an English musician. Originally a vocalist and guitarist, Burrell is best known for being the vocalist and bassist of King Crimson from 1971 to 1972 and the original bassist of Bad Company, formed in 1973, with whom he stayed until 1982 before re-joining for a reunion of the original line-up during 1998 to 1999. He died of a heart attack in Spain in 2006, aged 60.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Raymond Burrell was born on 1 August 1946 in Holbeach, Lincolnshire; he lived in Saracens Head and Holbeach Hurn. As a teen in the 1950s, he began playing rhythm guitar for the Tea Time 4, a group formed with his school pals Bernie Rudd and Brian Rocky Browne, at the George Farmer School. They both acquired a passion for jazz and enjoyed acts such as Mose Allison, John Coltrane, and Charles Mingus. He later attended King&#x27;s Lynn Technical College.

The group had several personnel changes and moved to London in 1965 at the suggestion of manager, Jack Barrie. With the addition of Ian McLagan on keyboard and a name change to Boz People, the group secured a contract with EMI&#x27;s Columbia label.

Burrell&#x27;s style leaned more towards jazz, whereas McLagan was into Booker T, four singles being recorded and backing band slots with Kenny Lynch and Elkie Brooks. However, with little commercial success, McLagan soon left to join The Small Faces.

Burrell next enjoyed a short stint in the soul band, Feel For Soul, back in Norwich from 1966 until the following year. In late 1965, Burrell was briefly considered to replace Roger Daltrey in The Who.

Between 1966 and 1968, Burrell released six singles in Britain on the Columbia label under the name Boz, including a cover of &quot;I Shall be Released&quot;, backed by &quot;Down in the Flood&quot; (wrongly named &quot;Dove in the Flood&quot; on the label), both written by Bob Dylan. On this he was joined by organist Jon Lord, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and drummer Ian Paice, who formed Deep Purple at the same time, and bassist Chas Hodges, later of Chas and Dave fame. Burrell later appeared on Centipede&#x27;s 1971 recording &quot;Septober Energy&quot;.

===King Crimson===

In 1971, Burrell joined King Crimson as the new vocalist, having met Robert Fripp while both were performing with Centipede. As well as a vocalist, the band were also in search of a new bass player. After Rick Kemp turned down a last-minute offer to join, Boz (who had only limited guitar-playing ability) was installed as the band&#x27;s bass player with Fripp and Ian Wallace teaching him to play rather than start the search again.

The band toured and recorded the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Islands&quot; (1971), a warmer sounding release and the band&#x27;s only string ensemble experimentation. Tensions began socially on tour and creatively with the direction of the group&#x27;s latest effort. This led to lyricist Peter Sinfield being ousted following the band&#x27;s next tour. During rehearsals in early 1972 the band fell apart with all members leaving due to creative restrictions imposed by Fripp as a &quot;quality control&quot; measure.

The band members were convinced to rejoin and fulfil their touring commitments for that year with the intention of disbanding thereafter. Recordings from this subsequent tour exist as the live album &quot;Earthbound&quot; (1972) and as a large part of the box set &quot;Sailors&#x27; Tales (1970–1972)&quot; (2017), which contains studio and live recordings spanning Burrell&#x27;s entire tenure in the band. Although relations improved between both parties leading to an offer from the musicians to continue on in the band, Fripp had already moved on and declined to participate.

In 1973, Burrell, Wallace and Mel Collins reunited with Sinfield for his solo effort, &quot;Still&quot;. They also went on to form Snape with CCS&#x27;s Alexis Korner and Peter Thorup, who had been on tour with King Crimson in the states the previous year, releasing the studio album, &quot;Accidentally Born in New Orleans&quot;, and a live album, &quot;Live on Tour in Germany&quot;. In 1974 Burrell featured with Chapman Whitney Streetwalkers along with other members of Family and King Crimson.

===Bad Company===

Burrell was a founding member of the supergroup Bad Company, formed in 1973 along with ex-Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and two former members of Free: vocalist Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke. The band debuted in 1974 with the self-titled &quot;Bad Company&quot;, which eventually went platinum, as did the 1975 follow-up, &quot;Straight Shooter&quot; and 1976&#x27;s &quot;Run with the Pack&quot;.

Released in1977, &quot;Burnin&#x27; Sky&quot; proved less successful. However, the group&#x27;s fifth release, &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; (release in 1979), saw the band once again return to platinum status. &quot;Rough Diamonds&quot;, the final studio album featuring the original members, released in 1982, was the worst-selling album in this incarnation and the band soon after split.

Using the name Bad Company, Ralphs and Kirke continued to play together. However, it was not until 1998 that Burrell rejoined his bandmates along with Rodgers for a reunion tour; they released four new songs and released the compilation &quot;The &#x27;Original&#x27; Bad Co. Anthology&quot;. Both Burrell and Ralphs left the band in 1999.

===Later work===
In January 1981, Burrell joined Roger Chapman again for his solo band, The Shortlist, leaving in 1983. He returned in May 1987, but left again the following year in June. In 1982, Burrell contributed to Jon Lord&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Before I Forget&quot;, on the track &quot;Hollywood Rock and Roll&quot;, and in 1984 he joined the short-lived Nightfly.

In the 1990s, Burrell worked with such acts as Alvin Lee for his &quot;Best of British Blues&quot; tour of 1996 and Ruby Turner. During this period, his main creative outlet was with the Scottish blues singer Tam White. Their collaboration developed into a trio known as The Shoe String Band and a big band, the Celtic Groove Connection. White was present at Burrell&#x27;s apartment in Spain when Burrell suddenly died of a heart attack during rehearsals, on 21 September 2006.

<text>Yum cha is the Cantonese tradition of breakfast or brunch involving Chinese tea and dim sum. The practice is popular in Cantonese-speaking regions, including Guangdong province, Guangxi province, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is also carried out in other regions worldwide where there are overseas Cantonese communities. &quot;Yum cha&quot; generally involves small portions of steamed, pan-fried, or deep-fried &quot;dim sum&quot; dishes served in bamboo steamers, which are designed to be eaten communally and washed down with hot tea. People often go to &quot;yum cha&quot; in large groups for family gatherings and celebrations.

== Description ==
&quot;Yum cha&quot; (; &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;drink tea&quot;), also known as &quot;going for dim sum&quot; (Cantonese: 食點心), is the Cantonese tradition of brunch involving Chinese tea and &quot;dim sum&quot;. The practice is popular in Cantonese-speaking regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is also carried out in other regions worldwide where there are overseas Chinese communities, like Vietnam, Australia, Canada, England and the United States.

&quot;Yum cha&quot; generally involves small portions of steamed, pan-fried, or deep-fried &quot;dim sum&quot; dishes served in bamboo steamers, which are designed to be eaten communally and washed down with hot tea. Traditionally, the elderly gather to eat dim sum after morning exercises. Many have yum cha with family during weekends and holiday gatherings.
== Etymology ==
&quot;Yum cha&quot; in the Cantonese language, both literary and vernacular, literally means &quot;drink tea&quot;. &quot;飲&quot; means &quot;to drink&quot;, and &quot;茶&quot; means &quot;tea&quot;. The term is also used interchangeably with &quot;tan cha&quot; (嘆茶) in the Cantonese language, which colloquially translates to &quot;enjoy tea&quot;.

In Cantonese, &quot;yum cha&quot; refers to having a meal with &quot;dim sum&quot; dishes. &quot;Dim sum&quot; is the English word based &quot;on&quot; the Cantonese pronunciation of 點心. 

In colloquial Mandarin dialects and Standard Vernacular Chinese based on one form of colloquial Mandarin, this character () is often used to mean 飲 for the verb &quot;drink&quot;. In the Chinese language, 點心 refers to a variety of foods, including European-style cakes and pastries, and has no equivalent in English. 

In the English language, &quot;dim sum&quot; refers to small-dish appetizers and desserts.

==Service==

Traditionally, &quot;yum cha&quot; is practiced in the morning or early afternoon, hence the terms &quot;zou cha&quot; (, &quot;morning tea&quot;) or &quot;ha ng&quot; &quot;cha&quot; (, &quot;afternoon tea&quot;) when appropriate. The former is also known as &quot;yum zou cha&quot; (, &quot;drinking morning tea&quot;). In some parts of Guangdong province, restaurants offer dim sum during dinner hours and even late at night. This is known as &quot;yum je cha&quot; (, &quot;drinking night tea&quot;), though most venues still generally reserve the serving of dim sum for breakfast and lunch periods. The combination of morning tea, afternoon tea, evening tea, lunch and dinner is known as &quot;sam cha leung fan&quot; (, &quot;three tea, two meal&quot;).

The history of the tradition can be traced back to the period of Xianfeng Emperor, who first referred to establishments serving tea as &quot;yi li guan&quot; (, &quot;1 cent house&quot;). These offered a place for people to gossip, which became known as &quot;cha waa&quot; (, &quot;tea talk&quot;). These tea houses grew to become their own type of restaurant and the visits became known as &quot;yum cha&quot;.

The traditional methods of serving &quot;dim sum&quot; include using trays strung around servers&#x27; necks or using push carts. The &quot;teoi ce&quot; (, &quot;push-cart&quot;) method of serving &quot;dim sum&quot;, dates back to the early 1960s and includes &quot;dim sum&quot; items cooked in advance, placed into steamer baskets, and brought out on push carts into the dining area. Employees call out the items they are serving, customers notify the server about the items they would like to order, and the server places the desired items on the table. The general &quot;yum cha&quot; atmosphere is a loud, festive one due to the servers calling out the dishes and the groups of diners having conversations.

Many &quot;dim sum&quot; restaurants now use a paper-based à la carte ordering system. This method provides fresh, cooked-to-order &quot;dim sum&quot; while managing the real estate and resource constraints involved with push cart service.

The cost of a meal was traditionally calculated by the number, size and type of dishes left on the patron&#x27;s table at the end. In modern &quot;yum cha&quot; restaurants, servers mark orders by stamping a card or marking a bill card on the table. Servers in some restaurants use distinctive stamps to track sales statistics for each server.

==Customs and etiquette==

The customs associated with the tea served at &quot;yum cha&quot; include&quot;:&quot; 

* Selecting the type of tea to be served immediately after being seated by the server.
* Pouring tea for others before filling one&#x27;s own tea cup, especially for the young ones serving tea to the elderly first, as a sign of politeness.
* Filling tea cups to about 80% because of the Cantonese proverb 「」, which is translated literally as &quot;it is fraud for the guest if the tea cup is full, but it is a sign of respect when it is alcohol.&quot;
* Tapping the table with two (occasionally one) fingers of the same hand in a gesture known as &#x27;finger kowtow&#x27; that is a gesture of gratitude after receiving tea. This gesture can be traced to the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, who used to travel incognito. While visiting the Jiangnan region, he once went into a teahouse with his companions. In order to maintain his anonymity, he took his turn at pouring tea. His companions wanted to bow to show their gratitude, but to do so would have revealed the identity of the emperor. Finally, one of them tapped three fingers on the table (one finger representing their bowed head and the other two representing their prostrate arms).
* Flipping open the lid (of hinged metal tea pots) or offset the tea pot cover (on ceramic tea pots) to signal an empty tea pot. Servers will then refill the pot.
* Following a traditional practice of washing the utensils with the first round of tea, tea is best served in hot cup to restore the temperature. A basin is available for disposing of the rinse tea. The taste of the first round of tea is considered not the finest yet, and will be richer afterwards.

For the diners, some typical customs include:

* Selecting the tables closest to the kitchen because the &quot;dim sum&quot; carts exit from there and the diners closest to the kitchen have first choice of the fresh dishes.
* Ordering dessert dishes on the &quot;dim sum&quot; carts at any time since there is not a set sequence for the meal.
* Feeling comfortable with declining dishes being offered by servers pushing the &quot;dim sum&quot; carts, regardless of the reasons (dietary, food preference, budgetary, or other reasons).

While eating, some of the manners include:

* Spinning the lazy susan such that the oldest person at the table has the opportunity to have the first serving when the meal starts or when an additional dish is served, to show respect. The lazy susan should not be spun when someone is taking food from a dish.
* Refraining from standing chopsticks straight up vertically, such as in rice or buns, due to the resemblance of incense offerings for the deceased.
* Offering dining companions the final serving when there is one last piece or final serving remaining on a dish.
* Insisting on paying the bill as it is common to treat one another to meals.
*In the case when there is no lazy Susan, only pick up the food which is in front of you.

== Status and future ==
&quot;Yum cha&quot; continues in both traditional and modern forms, including restaurants serving both traditional and modern fusion &quot;dim sum&quot;. Modern &quot;dim sum&quot; can include dishes like abalone siu mai and barbecued wagyu beef bun. &quot;Dim sum&quot; chefs for &quot;yum cha&quot; continue to be trained at leading culinary institutes. One restaurant in Hong Kong creates social media-friendly dishes by preparing dumplings and buns shaped to resemble animals. Whether traditional or modern-day, &quot;yum cha&quot; is to be shared with friends and loved ones.

<text>Michael Geoffrey Ralphs (born 31 March 1944) is an English retired guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, who was a founding member of rock bands Mott the Hoople and Bad Company. Though not a constant member, he appeared on every studio album by both bands.

== Career ==
Ralphs began his career as a teenager, playing with blues-rock band the Buddies. He released a single with that group in 1964 before joining the Mod Doc Thomas Group in 1966. After an eponymous Italian album debut, the band changed its name twice, first to Silence in 1968 and then, in 1969, to Mott the Hoople. Ralphs remained with the band until 1973, leaving just after they achieved their commercial breakthrough with the David Bowie-produced album &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot;, though he appeared on select tracks of the album &quot;The Hoople&quot;.

Upon exiting Mott the Hoople, he founded Bad Company along with vocalist Paul Rodgers from the band Free. The band&#x27;s debut album in 1974 included the Ralphs&#x27;-penned hit &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;, for which Ralphs tuned his guitar in the open-C tuning C-C-G-C-E-C, stating, &quot;It never really sounds right in standard tuning. It needs the open C to have that ring.&quot; The debut album reached number one in the United States. Ralphs continued to record and tour with Bad Company until the original band folded in 1982.

In 1984 he toured with Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour on Gilmour&#x27;s About Face tour, although he did not play on the album. In 1985, he released a solo album, &quot;Take This&quot;, which included Free&#x27;s and Bad Company&#x27;s drummer Simon Kirke. He teamed up with future Bad Company guitarist Dave Colwell for a limited four-run live support of the album, which also featured drummer Chris Slade of Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band and keyboard player Lindsay Bridgewater, who performed with Ozzy Osbourne. He did one performance with a band called Cold Turkey.

Bad Company reformed with different line-ups between 1986 and 1998. But after a reunion tour with the original foursome in 1999, Ralphs announced that he was giving up touring, something he was never comfortable with in either band, since he has an extreme fear of flying.

Ralphs second solo album &quot;It&#x27;s All Good&quot;, an instrumental, came out in 2001. Two years later his &quot;That&#x27;s Life – Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; album was released, including a demo version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;.

In 2004, he once again teamed up with former Mott colleague Ian Hunter, playing second lead guitar (along with Andy York) on Hunter&#x27;s UK tour. Ralphs performed at Hunter&#x27;s 2005 concert at the London Astoria, with Ralphs performing a guitar solo to &quot;All the Way from Memphis&quot;.

On 2 July 2008, it was announced that the original line-up of Bad Company (minus Boz Burrell who died in September 2006) would do a one-off gig at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida on 8 August 2008. According to Rodgers, they did this gig to &quot;protect the legacy they have built and cement the rights to the trademark Bad Company for touring&quot;.

Mott the Hoople, including Ralphs, reunited for two shows at the Blake Theatre in Monmouth close to Rockfield Studios where they rehearsed before playing five concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, during September and October 2009. All five of the original members participated in the reunion with Martin Chambers assisting on drums.

In 2011, Ralphs formed The Mick Ralphs Blues Band with musicians he met while guesting at a jam session at the Nag&#x27;s Head pub in High Wycombe: Stuart Son Maxwell, harmonica/vocals; Jim Maving, guitar; Sam Kelly, drums; Dickey Baldwin, bass. The band&#x27;s website stated that Ralphs sought to explore his blues and soul roots, playing covers of classic blues and R&amp;B songs. The band made its debut as Mick Ralphs and Co at Jagz Club in Ascot, Berkshire in June 2011, changing the name to the Mick Ralphs Blues Band soon afterwards. More dates were announced for late 2011 and early 2012.

In 2012, Bad Company performed a short run of European festival dates.

In 2013 and 2014, Bad Company and Lynyrd Skynyrd jointly toured throughout the United States and Canada, initially commemorating the 40th anniversary of Skynyrd&#x27;s first album release and Bad Company&#x27;s formation.

In 2016, Bad Company announced a US tour with Joe Walsh. Ralphs initially announced that he would not be participating in this tour and that Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes would be standing in for him. In June 2016, the group announced a UK arena tour with special guests Richie Sambora and Orianthi culminating in a show at London&#x27;s O2 Arena on 29 October. Ralphs rejoined the band for the duration of the tour. Following the band&#x27;s concluding performance in London, it was reported that Ralphs had been hospitalized, having suffered a stroke. He has not returned to the band since with his lead guitar parts being played by second guitarist, Howard Leese and keyboard parts being played by Rodgers.

<text>A bun is a type of bread roll, typically filled with savory fillings (for example hamburger). A bun may also refer to a sweet cake in certain parts of the world. Though they come in many shapes and sizes, buns are most commonly round, and are generally hand-sized or smaller.

In the United Kingdom, the usage of the term differs greatly in different regions. In Southern England, a bun is a hand-sized sweet cake, while in Northern England, it is a small round of ordinary bread. In Ireland, a bun refers to a sweet cake, roughly analogous to an American cupcake. 

Buns are usually made from a dough of flour, milk, yeast and small amounts of sugar and/or butter. Sweet bun dough is distinguished from bread dough by the addition of sugar, butter and sometimes egg. Common sweet varieties contain small fruit or nuts, topped with icing or caramel, and filled with jam or cream.

Chinese baozi, with savory or sweet fillings, are often referred to as &quot;buns&quot; in English.

<doc id="269602" wikidata="Q214427" url="?curid=269602" title="Friedrich Adolf Riedesel">
<text>The Baron Friedrich Adolf Riedesel zu Eisenbach (3 June 1738 – 6 January 1800) was a senior officer of Brunswick–Luneburg troops who commanded &quot;jägers&quot; in the Northern theater of the American War of Independence.

== Early life and education ==
Riedesel was born in Lauterbach, into the Riedesel family of Hessian Uradel barons, the second son of Johann Wilhelm Riedesel, Freiherr zu Eisenbach and Sophia von Borcke. His birth on June 3, 1738 and early education both took place in Lauterbach. The title of &quot;Freiherr&quot; (Baron) was carried by all men of his lineage who reached majority. His parents disagreed about his education; his mother wanted him prepared for a religious career, while his father sought a legal education and diplomatic service. Either of these was a proper career for a younger son.

Bowing to his father&#x27;s wishes, when 15 years old, he left for the study of law at the University of Marburg. Riedesel was an indifferent student, but spent time watching Hessian troops drill.

== Military career ==
An officer who had seen his interest befriended Riedesel, and later tricked him into enlisting. He was told that his father had consented to his enlistment, so at 17 he joined the Marburg battalion, only to have his allowance cut off when his angry father learned of it. The two were later reconciled, and Friedrich was granted an allowance from his father to help meet his expenses.

=== Seven Years&#x27; War ===
Ensign Riedesel&#x27;s first assignment was near London. Riedesel knew no French nor English, but learned both while in England, and made friends with several English officers that he would later meet in the Americas. The unit was recalled to the Holy Roman Empire in 1756, for what would become the Seven Years&#x27; War. Friedrich was attached to the personal staff of Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick and distinguished himself at the Battle of Minden in 1759. He served for a time (1760) in the Hessian Hussar regiment and had a portrait done wearing their uniform. Riedesel also gained the attention of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, and by 1761, he was in command of two Brunswicker regiments as their Colonel.

In August 1762, he was wounded in battle against the French, and sent back to Minden to recover. There he was cared for by the von Massow family and nursed by their daughter Charlotte. In December the couple wed at Paderborn and settled in Brunswick&#x27;s capital city of Wolfenbüttel, where they lived quietly for several years. During these years, Riedesel commuted to Brunswick, where he was adjutant to the duke. He also fathered three daughters: Gustava (1771-1805), Frederica (1774-1854), and Caroline (1776-1861).

=== American War of Independence ===
When the American Revolution broke out in 1775, the British government found itself in need of trained troops to suppress the rebellion. The rulers of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel came from the Bevern line of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg, while the British throne was occupied by the Hanover line of the same family. In 1776, Duke Charles I signed a treaty with George III of the United Kingdom to provide 4,000 foot soldiers and 350 heavy dragoons for British service.

On 18 March, they sailed from Stade with the newly promoted Major General Riedesel as their commander. After a stop over in England, they arrived in Quebec City on 1 June. They supported the final expulsion from Canada of the American forces during the invasion of Canada. They were then distributed for the winter through various posts in Canada.

General Riedesel was put in command of all German and American Indian forces during the Saratoga campaign of 1777. His letters to the Duke of Brunswick reveal discontent with British Generals Burgoyne and Howe. One example of Riedesel&#x27;s disagreements with Burgoyne came after his victory at the Battle of Hubbardton, when rebels under Seth Warner gathered to attack loyalists under Philip Skene at Castle Town, Vermont. General Riedesel had promised protection to the loyalists, and wanted to attack the rebels at once. Burgoyne stalled, however, and ordered Riedesel to continue his advance instead of stopping to fight Warner&#x27;s militia. General Riedesel warned the Duke of Brunswick that even if the campaign went well, they could not hope to be back to Germany in 1778.

During the campaign, Riedesel showed an ability to adapt to combat in the American wilderness. He issued new orders to his army to attack in open order from cover of trees, and when forced to fight in the open, to close order and immediately charge with the bayonet.

Riedesel’s wife, Frederika Charlotte, became herself a relevant actor. She traveled to Canada with her infant daughters to be with her husband on the campaign. Her &quot;Letters and Journals Relating to the War of the American Revolution and the Capture of the German Troops at Saratoga&quot; is an important resource for knowledge of the campaign and its key personalities. Her harrowing account of her experiences in what is now known as the Marshall House where her husband had sent her to seek shelter during the closing days of the siege at Saratoga is one of the vivid episodes of the American Revolution. 

Riedesel and his wife were captured when General John Burgoyne surrendered after the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. He was imprisoned with the Convention Army in Charlottesville, Virginia at the Albemarle Barracks. They transferred to New York, where General Riedesel spent a year on parole, before being exchanged for American General William Thompson. The Baron commanded troops on Long Island in Winter 1780-81. In 1781, Quebec governor Frederick Haldimand named Riedesel officer in charge of the Sorel District, where he and his family stayed until his departure from North America at the end of Summer 1783. According to Charlotte&#x27;s diary and local lore, the Riedesels introduced the custom of an illuminated Christmas tree in North America while in Sorel in 1781. 

General Riedesel returned to Europe in late 1783, sailing first to England. He led the remainder of his Brunswick troops to a review by Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, who had become the ruler of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in 1780, while his army was being held captive in the United States. Riedesel was promoted to Lieutenant-General in 1787, and given command of the Brunswick troops in the southern provinces of Holland.

== Later life and death ==
Riedesel retired in 1793, but was named Commandant of the city of Brunswick. He met John Quincy Adams in 1797, and &quot;made many enquiries about the United States, and in particular after General Schuyler.&quot; Riedesel died at Brunswick in 1800.

==Styles==
Beginning with the publication of the couple&#x27;s letters from the American Revolution arranged by one of his sons-in-law (von Reuß), the General came to be referred to as &quot;von Riedesel&quot; in American scholarly and popular writing. This is historically incorrect. From its earliest known members in the 13th century down to the present, family members have rarely used the predicate &quot;von&quot; in their name. The patent from Emperor Leopold I in 1680 which raised them to the status of Barons (&quot;Freiherren&quot;) did not designate them as &quot;von.&quot; In the initial volume of the authorized history of the family (1923), the author E. E. Becker clearly states that the Riedesel zu Eisenbach did not use the &quot;von&quot; in their names.

== Issue ==
General Riedesel and Charlotte had the following children, some born in North America:
* Hermann (1767-1767)
* Philippine (1770-1771)
* Auguste (1771-1805); married Count Heinrich von Reuss
* Friederike (1774-1854); married Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden
* Caroline (1776-1861); never married
* Amerika (1780-1856); married Count Ernst von Bernsdorff
* Canada (1782-1783)
* Georg Karl (1785-1854); married Caroline Riedesel
* Charlotte (1787-1848); married Wilhelm von Schöning

<doc id="269604" wikidata="Q1362216" url="?curid=269604" title="First Minister of Scotland">
<text>The first minister of Scotland, formally known as the First Minister and Keeper of the Scottish Seal, is the head of government of Scotland. The first minister leads the Scottish Government, the executive branch of the devolved government and is the keeper of the Great Seal, one of the great officers of state in Scotland. 

The first minister chairs the Scottish Cabinet and is primarily responsible for the formulation, development, and presentation of the Scottish Government&#x27;s policies. Additional functions of the first minister include promoting and representing Scotland in an official capacity, at home and abroad, as part of the Scottish Government&#x27;s approach to international relations. The first minister is nominated by the Scottish Parliament by members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), and is formally appointed by the monarch. 

Members of the Scottish Cabinet and junior ministers of the Scottish Government are appointed by the first minister. The first minister is directly accountable to the Scottish Parliament for their actions and the actions of the wider government and cabinet. Additionally, the first minister is responsible for appointing the country&#x27;s law officers – the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland, as well as nominating and appointing the Lord President of the Court of Session, the Lord Justice Clerk and Senator&#x27;s of the College of Justice, judges who sit within the Supreme Courts of Scotland. 

The first minister is supported by their deputy first minister, as well as cabinet secretaries, junior ministers, government directorates and civil servants. The first minister is advised on matters by their chief of staff. The office is currently held by John Swinney, the MSP for Perthshire North and the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP). Swinney was elected first minister by the Scottish Parliament on 7 May 2024, and was sworn in the following day at the Court of Session.

== History ==
Following the referendum in 1997, in which the Scottish electorate gave their consent, the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Executive (later the Scottish Government) were established by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Labour government of the prime minister, Tony Blair.

Under the Acts of Union 1707, the former Parliament of Scotland merged with the English parliament, forming the Parliament of Great Britain. The re-establishment of a dedicated legislature and executive for Scotland was known as devolution and initiated a measure of home rule (self-governance) in its domestic affairs, such as health, education and justice. The devolution movement came to a head in the 1970s, and resulted in a Royal Commission on the Constitution, leading to the Scotland Act 1978. This would have established an autonomous Scottish Executive with a leader termed &#x27;First Secretary&#x27;, a post for which Strathclyde political leader Geoff Shaw was widely expected to be chosen. Shaw died prematurely and the failure of the referendum of 1979 led to the Act not being implemented.

Following the 1997 referendum and Scotland Act 1998, Scottish devolution led to the establishment of a post of first minister as head of the devolved Scottish Government.

Since 1999, the Secretary of State for Scotland of the British Government has had a much reduced role at the renamed Scotland Office as a result of the transfer of responsibilities to the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government.

== Election and term ==
===Nomination as First Minister===
The first minister is nominated by the Scottish Parliament at the beginning of each term, by means of an exhaustive ballot among its members, and is then formally appointed by the monarch.

Although any member of the Scottish Parliament can be nominated for first minister, the government must maintain the confidence of the Scottish Parliament in order to gain supply (access to exchequer funds) and remain in office. For this reason, every permanent first minister has been the leader of the largest party, or the leader of the senior partner in any majority coalition. There is no term of office for a first minister; they hold office &quot;at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. In practice, a first minister cannot remain in office against the will of the Scottish Parliament; indeed, the Scotland Act explicitly requires the first minister to either resign or seek a parliamentary dissolution (and with it, new elections) if his or her government &quot;no longer enjoys the confidence of the Parliament.&quot; Whenever the office of first minister falls vacant, the sovereign is responsible for appointing the new incumbent upon nomination by the Scottish Parliament; the appointment is formalised at a meeting between the sovereign and the first minister designate.

Given the additional member system used to elect its members, it is difficult for a single party to gain an overall majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP did gain an overall majority of seats in the 2011 election, and thus had enough numbers to vote in its leader, Alex Salmond, as first minister for a second term.

After the election of the Scottish Parliament, a first minister must be nominated within a period of 28 days. Under the terms of the Scotland Act, if the Parliament fails to nominate a first minister, within this time frame, it will be dissolved and a fresh election held. If an incumbent first minister is defeated in a general election, they do not immediately vacate office. The first minister only leaves office when the Scottish Parliament nominates a successor individual.

===Oath of office===

After accepting office, the first minister takes the Official Oath, as set out in the Promissory Oaths Act 1868. The oath is tendered by the Lord President of the Court of Session at a sitting of the Court in Parliament House in Edinburgh. The oath is:
===Term in office===
The period in office of a first minister is not linked to the term of members of the Scottish Parliament. The Scotland Act set out a four-year maximum term for each session of Parliament. The Act specifies that an election to the Scottish Parliament will be held on the first Thursday in May, every four years, starting from 1999. Parliament can be dissolved and an extraordinary general election held, before the expiration of the four-year term, but only if two-thirds (or more) of elected MSPs vote for such action in a resolution of the Scottish Parliament. If a simple majority of MSPs voted a no-confidence motion in the first minister or government, that would trigger a 28-day period for the nomination of a replacement; should that time period expire without the nomination of a new first minister, then an extraordinary election would have to be called.

The first minister, once appointed, continues in office as the head of the Scottish Government until they resign, are dismissed or die in office. Resignation can be triggered by the passage of a Motion of No Confidence in the first minister or the Scottish Government or by rejecting a motion of confidence in the Scottish Parliament. In those situations, the first minister must tender their resignation and the resignation of their government. In such circumstances, the presiding officer would appoint an interim first minister, until the Scottish Parliament determined on a new nominee to be appointed by the monarch.

During their tenure in office, the First Minister is supported by the Chief of Staff to the First Minister, who acts at the first minister&#x27;s principal adviser on the first minister&#x27;s strategic programme in government, inter-governmental relations, co-ordination of the team of special advisers to the first minister.

==Legislative powers==
===Scots Law and civil service===

As detailed in the Scotland Act 1998, the First Minister is responsible for recommending to the monarch a nominee for the position of Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland. The First Minister is also responsible for advocating whether a Lord Advocate or Solicitor General who is currently in post should be removed, subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament. Additionally, the First Minister has various functions and responsibilities regarding the appointments and removal of Scottish judges within the Scottish court system.

The Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government is nominated by the First Minister. The permanent secretary is the most senior civil servant in Scotland who serves to promote, implement, develop and communicating the Scottish Government&#x27;s policy agenda. The First Minister is directly responsible for the management of the civil service in Scotland, as well as civil service staff within the Scottish Government.

The First Minister has responsibility in respect of the exercise of operation and functions during vacancies which may arise in the offices of Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice Clerk and the incapacity of the holders of those offices as outlined in the Senior Judiciary (Vacancies and Incapacity)(Scotland) Act 2006. Additionally, the First Minister considers any action relating to recommendations made by the Standards Commission or Chief Investigating Officer in regards of Crown Appointments under Section 23 of the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000.

The First Minister is an official consultee regarding selections for membership of the Supreme Court.

===Security and intelligence===

The Office of the First Minister has responsibility for all functions relating to reports made by the Interception of Communications Commissioner and Intelligence Services Commissioner as detailed in both Sections 58 and 60 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. During times of national crisis, such as flooding, terror attacks or public health emergencies, the First Minister chairs the Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR). The function of the resilience room committee is to co-ordinate policy and response to major events in Scotland that affect the population and, with the help of specialist teams within the division assist department, develop detailed risk assessments which are used to inform policy across Scotland.

====Resilience response====

There are currently different levels of resilience response in Scotland which is overseen by the First Minister and Scottish Government ministers:

* Cabinet Sub-Committee: Scottish Government Resilience CSC
* The Scottish Resilience Partnership (SRP)
* Scottish Government Resilience (Ministerial): SGoR(M)
* Scottish Government Resilience (Officials): SGoR(O)
* Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR)

The first minister has chaired meetings of the Scottish Government Resilience Room on numerous occasions, such as in the aftermath of the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack and ahead of Storm Éowyn making landfall in Scotland in January 2025.

====Resilience levels====

The First Minister is directly responsible for each of the corresponding resilience levels in Scotland, and has the responsibility of the Scottish Government Liaison Offices who can be deployed in emergencies and national crisis to act as the principal point of contact for the First Minister, Scottish Government and other Scottish ministers.

If a crisis or emergency is considered to affect the entirely of either the United Kingdom or the British Isles, such as the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack, the UK Government and Scottish Government (along with the governments of both Wales and Northern Ireland), will develop a co-ordinate response to a UK wide emergency or crisis. The First Minister is directly responsible for co-ordinating this policy and would be called to attend the UK Government&#x27;s emergency room, COBRA, for instances such as a significant terrorist attack, a serious outbreak of animal disease or emergencies affecting large numbers of British citizens overseas.

===Keeper of the Great Seal===

The First Minister is the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland which is considered to be one of the highest privileges of the office. The First Minister has additional responsibility over how Wafer Scottish Seals are to be kept and how they are to be taken under section 38(4) &amp; 38(5)(b) of the Scotland Act. The First Minister has the power to sign royal warrants on behalf of the monarch.

As Keeper of the Great Seal, First Minister Humza Yousaf was the first First Minister to oversee the departure of the Stone of Scone, an ancient symbol of Scotland&#x27;s nationhood, for Westminster Abbey for usage in the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla on 6 May.

===Privy Council===
The First Minister is a member of the Privy Council and is appointed by the Monarch. There are a variety of matters in which the Prime Minister would offer advice to the monarch on the exercise of their functions and on which it would be appropriate for the Prime Minister to consult or to take advice from the First Minister. Such matters include the recommendations of Scottish candidates for honours and dignities, which are currently a reserved matter under the devolution settlement, and advice on the appointment of the Lords Lieutenants in Scotland, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and members of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and the Forestry Commission. There are also matters where a Minister of the Crown gives advice to the reigning monarch and the First Minister would need to be consulted by the Minister of the Crown, or would be required to give advice to that Minister of the Crown.

The Scotland Act 1998 confers upon the First Minister various functions of advising the monarch directly. Such functions include seeking the monarch&#x27;s approval regarding the appointment of Scottish Ministers as well as recommending to the monarch nominations for appointment as Scottish Law Officers. Section 95 of the Scotland Act highlights the arrangements for the First Minister to nominate for the appointment as Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice Clerk. Additionally, the Scotland Act also grants the First Minister to recommend to the monarch the appointment of other judges.

== Executive powers ==

The First Minister is the head of the Scottish Government and is responsible for the overall development, implementation and presentation of the government&#x27;s policies, as well as responsible promoting and representing Scotland at home and overseas. The role and powers of the first minister are set out in sections 45 to 49 of the Scotland Act 1998.

===Cabinet appointments===

Following their appointment, the first minister may then nominate ministers to sit in the Scottish Cabinet and junior ministers to form the Scottish Government. They are then formally elected by the Scottish Parliament. Ministers hold office at His Majesty&#x27;s Pleasure and may be removed from office, at any time, by the first minister. The first minister also has the power to appoint the law officers and chief legal officers of the Scottish Government – the lord advocate and the solicitor general but only with the support of the Scottish Parliament.

===Accountability to parliament===

The first minister is responsible to the Scottish Parliament for their actions and the actions of the overall Scottish Government. MSPs can scrutinise the activities of the first minister and their Cabinet by tabling written questions or by asking oral questions in the Scottish Parliament. Direct questioning of the first minister takes place at First Minister&#x27;s Questions (FMQs) each Thursday at noon when Parliament is sitting. The 30-minute session enables MSPs to ask questions of the first minister, on any issue. The leaders of the largest opposition parties have an allocation of questions and are allowed to question the first minister each week. Opposition leaders normally ask an opening question to the first minister, relating to their meeting with the Scottish Cabinet, or when they next expect to meet the Prime Minister, and then follow this up by asking a supplementary question on an issue of their choosing.

In addition to direct questioning, the first minister is also able to deliver oral statements to the Scottish Parliament chamber, after which members are invited to question the first minister on the substance of the statement. For example, at the beginning of each parliamentary term, the first minister normally delivers a statement, setting out the legislative programme of the Government, or a statement of government priorities over the forthcoming term.

===International and foreign relations===
====Foreign policy====

Whilst foreign policy remains a reserved matter, the Scottish Government, and the First Minister, may promote the economy and Scottish interests on the world stage and encourage foreign businesses, international devolved, regional and central governments to invest in Scotland. Whilst the first minister usually undertakes a number of international visits to promote Scotland, international relations, European and Commonwealth relations are also included within the portfolios of the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs (responsible for international development) and the Minister for International Development and Europe (responsible for European Union relations and international relations). Overall, accountability for intergovernmental relations is the responsibility of the First Minister.

====International relations====

During Donald Dewar&#x27;s tenure as First Minister, he made a total of five international visits – Belgium, Republic of Ireland, Netherlands, Japan and another in Ireland – before his death in October 2000. Henry McLeish conducted six international visits – Italy, three in Belgium, United States of America, Finland, and a joint visit to Japan and Taiwan. McLeish led the Scottish Executive&#x27;s response to the September 11 attacks in the United States. He was initially concerned about Scotland&#x27;s defence strategy and feared the country&#x27;s major cities, such as Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen, would be targets based on their economic strength and significance to the Scottish, UK and European economies.

On September 13, 2001, McLeish moved a motion in the Scottish Parliament to send condolences to the people of the United States and New York. Through the motion, McLeish said &quot;the Parliament condemns the senseless and abhorrent acts of terrorism carried out in the United States yesterday and extends our deepest sympathies to those whose loved ones have been killed or injured&quot;. Henry McLeish&#x27;s successor, Jack McConnell engaged in a total of 28 international visits during his tenure as First Minister between 2001 and 2007. McConnell carried out international engagements in Ireland, five in the United States, eight in Belgium, South Africa, two in Italy, Austria, three in France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, China, Malawi, Canada and Australia. McConnell spearheaded the establishment of the Scotland Malawi Partnership in 2004, which co-ordinates the activities of Scottish individuals and organisations with existing links to Malawi, and aims to foster further links between both countries. 

Alex Salmond, Scotland&#x27;s fourth First Minister from 2007 to 2014, engaged in a total of twenty overseas visits during his tenure as First Minister. Salmond&#x27;s international engagements included visits to Belgium, five in the United States, Sri Lanka, three in Ireland, Spain, Hong Kong, two in China, Denmark, Guernsey, two in the Isle of Man, Norway and India. In response to the Brexit vote, first minister Nicola Sturgeon travelled to Brussels to meet with both Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission as well as Martin Schulz, the President of the European Parliament, to discuss Scotland&#x27;s future within the European Union. Sturgeon&#x27;s successor, Humza Yousaf&#x27;s first international visit as First Minister was to Brussels in June 2023, which, during a three-day visit, sought to set out his &quot;vision for a meaningful and mutually beneficial relationship&quot; between Scotland and the European Union. Yousaf declared his desire to set up a permanent Scottish Government envoy to the European Union in Brussels to &quot;aid the cause of independence&quot;.

First minister John Swinney, who succeeded Humza Yousaf in May 2024, welcomed President of Zambia, Hakainde Hichilema, to Bute House in Edinburgh in June 2024 for a series of &quot;high–level engagements&quot;, including strengthening bilateral relations between Zambia and Scotland, economic cooperation, education, and sustainable development. During a visit to Germany in June 2024, Swinney met with the British Ambassador to Germany, Jill Gallard, and visited Munich in order to promote Scotland, Scottish culture and tourism.

====Membership bodies====

The first minister is a member of the Prime Minister and Heads of Devolved Governments Council, the Council of Nations and Regions and Conference of European Regions with Legislative Power (REGLEG). During the premiership of Jack McConnell, Scotland held the presidency of REGLEG between 2003 and 2004. Other cabinet secretaries and junior ministers within the Scottish Government participate in tier two (the Inter-ministerial Standing Committee) and tier 3 (the Inter-ministerial Group) of The Council which may include areas including education, finance and economy, investment and trade and rural affairs. 

The First Minister represents Scotland at the annual British-Irish Council summits. Incumbent first ministers also attend meetings of the United Nations on occasions. First minister Nicola Sturgeon addressed the United Nations General Assembly on the issue of gender equality and the role of women in conflict resolution in April 2017. Additionally, Sturgeon addressed the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

===Deputy and &#x27;Acting&#x27; First Minister===

Associated with the office of first minister, there is also the post of deputy first minister. Unlike the office of first minister, the post of deputy is not recognised in statute and confers no extra status on the holder. Like the first minister, the deputy first minister is an elected member of the Scottish Parliament and a member of the Scottish Government. From 1999 to 2007, when Scotland was governed by a Labour–Liberal Democrat coalition, the leader of the Liberal Democrats – the junior government party – was given the role of deputy first minister; a title which they held in conjunction with another ministerial portfolio. For example, Nicol Stephen, deputy first minister from 2005 to 2007, simultaneously held the post of Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning.

On two occasions since 1999, the deputy first minister has assumed the role of &#x27;acting&#x27; first minister, inheriting the powers of the first minister in their absence or incapacitation. From 11 October 2000 to 26 October 2000, following the death in office of the then First Minister Donald Dewar, his deputy Jim Wallace became acting first minister, until the Labour party appointed a new leader, and consequently first minister. Wallace also became Acting First Minister between 8 November 2001 and 22 November 2001, following the resignation of Henry McLeish.

An officer with such a title need not always exist; rather, the existence of the post is dependent on the form of Cabinet organisation preferred by the first minister and their party. The deputy first minister does not automatically succeed if a vacancy in the premiership is suddenly created. It may be necessary for the deputy to stand in for the first minister on occasion, for example by taking the floor at First Minister&#x27;s Questions.

=== Precedence and privileges ===

The first minister is, by virtue of section 45(7) of the Scotland Act 1998, &quot;ex officio&quot; the keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland and their place in the order of precedence in Scotland is determined by the holding of that office. The scale of precedence in Scotland was amended by royal warrant on 30 June 1999 to take account of devolution and the establishment of the post of first minister. The amended scale reflected the transfer of the office of keeper of the Great Seal from the secretary of state for Scotland to the first minister and also created a rank for the presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament. Throughout Scotland, the first minister outranks all others except the royal family, lord lieutenants, the sheriff principal, the Lord Chancellor, the moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Commonwealth prime ministers (whilst in the United Kingdom), the speaker of the House of Commons and the Lord Speaker. As keeper of the Great Seal, the first minister is entitled to fly the Royal Banner of Scotland.

As of April 2015, the first minister is entitled to draw a total salary of £144,687, which is composed of a basic MSP salary of £59,089 plus an additional salary of £85,598 for the role as first minister. This can be compared to the UK Prime Minister who is entitled to draw a total salary of £142,500, composed of a basic MP salary of £67,060 and an additional office holder&#x27;s salary of £75,440 (the total entitlement for the prime minister had peaked at £198,661 in April 2011 but this was then dropped by around 25%). The first minister is the highest paid member of the Scottish Government. Sturgeon said she would claim £135,605, £9,082 less than her entitlement, as part of a voluntary pay freeze pegging her salary to 2008/09 levels.

The first minister traditionally resides at Bute House which is located at number 6 Charlotte Square in the New Town of Edinburgh. The house became the property of the National Trust for Scotland in 1966, after the death of the previous owner John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute and remains in the ownership of the National Trust for Scotland. Prior to devolution, Bute House was the official residence of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Weekly meetings of the Scottish Cabinet take place in the Cabinet room of the house. Bute House is also where the first minister holds press conferences, hosts visiting dignitaries and employs and dismisses government Ministers. The Office of the First Minister is located at St Andrews House in Edinburgh.

Appointments to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom are made by the monarch, although in practice they are made only on the advice of the UK government. To date all first ministers have been appointed members of the Privy Council, and therefore entitled to use the style &#x27;Right Honourable&#x27;.

<doc id="269613" wikidata="Q262557" url="?curid=269613" title="Epistle of Barnabas">
<text>The Epistle of Barnabas () is an early Christian Greek epistle written between AD 70 and AD 135. The complete text is preserved in the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus, where it appears at the end of the New Testament, following the Book of Revelation and before the Shepherd of Hermas. For several centuries, it was one of the &quot;antilegomena&quot; (&quot;disputed&quot;) writings that some Christians looked at as sacred scripture, while others excluded them. Eusebius of Caesarea classified it with excluded texts. It is mentioned in a perhaps third-century list in the sixth-century Codex Claromontanus and in the later Stichometry of Nicephorus appended to the ninth-century &quot;Chronography&quot; of Nikephoros I of Constantinople. Some early Fathers of the Church ascribed it to the Barnabas mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, but it is now generally attributed to an otherwise unknown early Christian teacher (though some scholars do defend the traditional attribution). It is distinct from the Gospel of Barnabas.

The central message of the Epistle of Barnabas is that the writings comprising the Hebrew Bible—what would become the Old Testament of the Christian Bible—were, from even their times of authorship, written for use by &quot;Christians&quot; rather than the Israelites and, by extension, the Jews. According to the epistle, the Jews had misinterpreted their own law (i.e., &quot;halakha&quot;) by applying it literally; the true meaning was to be found in its symbolic prophecies foreshadowing the coming of Jesus of Nazareth, who Christians believe to be the messiah. Furthermore, the author posits that the Jews broke their covenant from the very beginning and were misled by an evil angel. After explaining its Christian interpretations of the Jewish scriptures, the epistle concludes by discussing the &quot;Two Ways,&quot; also seen in the Didache: a &quot;Way of Light&quot; and a &quot;Way of Darkness.&quot;

== Manuscript tradition ==

The 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus (S), discovered by Constantin von Tischendorf in 1859 and published by him in 1862, contains a complete text of the Epistle placed after the canonical New Testament and followed by the Shepherd of Hermas. The 11th-century Codex Hierosolymitanus (H), which also includes the Didache, the two Epistles of Clement and the longer version of the Letters of Ignatius of Antioch, is another witness to the full text. It was discovered by Philotheos Bryennios at Constantinople in 1873 and published by him in 1875. Adolf Hilgenfeld used it for his 1877 edition of the Epistle of Barnabas. A family of 10 or 11 manuscripts dependent on the 11th-century Codex Vaticanus graecus 859 (G) contain chapters 5:7b−21:9 placed as a continuation of a truncated text of Polycarp&#x27;s letter to the Philippians (1:1–9:2). An old Latin version (L), perhaps of no later than the end of the 4th century, that is preserved in a single 9th-century manuscript (St Petersburg, Q.v.I.39) gives the first 17 chapters (without the &quot;Two Ways&quot; section of chapters 18 to 21) This is a fairly literal rendering in general, but is sometimes significantly shorter than the Greek text. S and H generally agree on readings. G often agrees with L against S and H. A small papyrus fragment (PSI 757) of the third or fourth century has the first 6 verses of chapter 9, and there are a few fragments in Syriac of chapters 1, 19,20. The writings of Clement of Alexandria give a few brief quotations, as to a smaller extent do Origen, Didymus the Blind and Jerome.
== Status for Christians ==
The Epistle was viewed as authoritative scripture by some Christians in the early centuries of church history. It was attributed to Barnabas, the companion of Paul the Apostle, by Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215) and Origen (c. 184 – c. 253). Clement quotes it with phrases such as &quot;the Apostle Barnabas says.&quot; Origen speaks of it as &quot;the General Epistle of Barnabas,&quot; a phrase usually associated with canonical non-Pauline epistles.

In the fourth century, the Epistle was also highly regarded by Didymus the Blind (c. 313 – c. 398), Serapion of Thmuis (c. 290 – c. 358), and Jerome (c. 342 – 420) as an authentic work of the apostolic Barnabas. Its inclusion in close proximity to the New Testament writings in Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Claromontanus witnesses to the canonical or near-canonical authority it held for some Christians, though it is argued by some that this is evidence merely of its popularity and usefulness, not necessarily of canonicity.

Eusebius (c. 260 – c. 340), in book three of his &quot;Church History&quot;, excluded it from &quot;the accepted books,&quot; classifying it as among the &quot;rejected&quot; or &quot;spurious&quot; (νόθοι) writings, although he elsewhere included this same Epistle of Barnabas with Hebrews and Jude in the category of “disputed scriptures” (ἀντιλεγομένων γραφῶν).

In the sixth-century, Codex Claromontanus (a list of Old Testament and New Testament books, dating from the third or fourth century) includes the Epistle of Barnabas between Jude and Revelation along with the Shepherd of Hermas, the Acts of Paul and the Apocalypse of Peter. Next to the listing of Barnabas is a dash (most likely added some time later) that may indicate doubtful or disputed canonicity, though the same marking is found next to 1 Peter as well, so its meaning is unclear. 

The Stichometry of Nicephorus, a later list of uncertain date appended to the &quot;Chronography&quot; of the early 9th century Nikephoros I of Constantinople, puts the Epistle of Barnabas among its four &quot;disputed&quot; New Testament works — along with the Book of Revelation, the Revelation of Peter and the Gospel of the Hebrews — but not among its seven &quot;New Testament apocrypha&quot;.

== Date of composition ==
In 16.3–4, the Epistle of Barnabas reads:

As commonly interpreted, this passage places the Epistle after the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70. It also places the Epistle before the Bar Kokhba revolt of AD 132, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. The document must therefore come from the period between the two Jewish revolts. Attempts at identifying a more precise date are conjectures. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; puts the latest possible date at AD 130, and for the actual date of composition gives &quot;&quot;circa&quot; AD 100&quot;. Its 1911 edition opted strongly for &quot;the reign of Vespasian (AD 70-79)&quot;, shortly after the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; had preferred AD 130−131 in an article by Paulin Ladeuze, and AD 96−98 in an article by John Bertram Peterson. On a more precise dating within the limits associated with the Jerusalem temple there is thus an &quot;absence of scholarly consensus&quot;. 

Jay Curry Treat comments on the absence in the Epistle of Barnabas (except for a possible reference to the phrase &quot;Many are called, but few are chosen&quot; in the Gospel according to Matthew) of citations from the New Testament: 

J.E Jacquier is of a different opinion, pointing to the fact that the reference to Matthew 22:14 is proceeded by the words &quot;as the scripture says&quot; (&quot;os gegraptai&quot;) which not only shows that the words are a quotation but according to him &quot;proves that the author considered the Gospel of Matthew equal in point of authority to the writings of the Old Testament&quot;.

Helmut Koester considers the Epistle to be earlier than the Gospel of Matthew: in his &quot;Introduction to the New Testament&quot; he says of the author of the Epistle: &quot;It cannot be shown that he knew and used the Gospels of the New Testament. On the contrary, what &quot;Barnabas&quot; presents here is from &#x27;the school of the evangelists&#x27;. This demonstrates how the early Christian communities paid special attention to the exploration of Scripture in order to understand and tell the suffering of Jesus. &quot;Barnabas&quot; still represents the initial stages of the process that is continued in the &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot;, later in Matthew, and is completed in Justin Martyr.&quot;

John Finnis has recently argued that the Epistle may have been written around the year 40 AD, proposing that chapter 16 refers instead to the destruction of the First Temple in 587 BC.

An opposing view is enunciated by Everett Ferguson: &quot;The language of rebuilding the temple in 16.3–5 refers to the spiritual temple of the heart of Gentile believers (any allusion to a physical temple in Jerusalem is doubtful).&quot; On the date of composition he says: &quot;The &quot;Epistle of Barnabas&quot; is usually dated to 130−135, although an earlier date in the late 70s has had its champions, and 96−98 is a possibility.&quot;

== Provenance ==

The place of origin is generally taken to be Alexandria in Egypt. It is first attested there (by Clement of Alexandria). Its allegorical style points to Alexandria. Barnabas 9:6 mentions idol-worshipping priests as circumcised, a practice in use in Egypt. However, some scholars have suggested an origin in Syria or Asia Minor.

Treat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas:
== Contents ==
The Epistle of Barnabas has the form not so much of a letter (it lacks indication of identity of sender and addressees), but as of a treatise. In this, it is like the Epistle to the Hebrews, which Tertullian ascribed to the apostle Barnabas and with which it has &quot;a large amount of superficial resemblance&quot;. On the other hand, it does have some features of an epistolary character, and Reidar Hvalvik argues that it is in fact a letter.

The document can be divided into two parts. Chapters 1−17 give a Christ-centred interpretation of the Old Testament, which it says should be understood spiritually, not in line with the literal meaning of its rules on sacrifice (chapter 2: the sacrifice God wants is that of a contrite heart), fasting (3: the fasting God wants is from injustice), circumcision (9), diet (10: rules that really prohibit behaviour such as praying to God only when in need, like swine crying out when hungry but ignoring their master when full, or being predatory like eagle, falcon, kite and crow, etc.; and that command to chew by meditating the cud of the word of the Lord and to divide the hoof by looking for the holy world to come while walking in this world), sabbath (15), and the temple (16). The passion and death of Jesus at the hands of the Jews, it says, is foreshadowed in the properly understood rituals of the scapegoat (7) and the red heifer (8) and in the posture assumed by Moses in extending his arms (according to the Greek Septuagint text known to the author of the Epistle) in the form of the execution cross, while Joshua, whose name in Greek is Ἰησοῦς (Jesus), fought against Amalek (12). The last four chapters, 18−21, are a version of The Two Ways teaching that appears also in chapters 1−5 of the Didache.

As viewed by Andrew Louth, the author &quot;is simply concerned to show that the Old Testament Scriptures are Christian Scriptures and that the spiritual meaning is their real meaning&quot;. As viewed by Bart D. Ehrman, the Epistle of Barnabas is &quot;more anti-Jewish than anything that did make it into the New Testament&quot;.

=== Midrash and gematria ===
According to David Dawson, &quot;the Jewish mind-set of Barnabas, evident in its choice of images and examples, is unmistakable&quot;. He says that the work&#x27;s two-part structure, with a distinct second part beginning with chapter 18, and its exegetical method &quot;provide the most striking evidence of its Jewish perspective. It is presented as a &quot;talmud&quot; or &quot;didachē&quot; (&#x27;teaching&#x27;) divided into &quot;haggadah&quot; and &quot;halakhah&quot;. It uses Philonic allegorical techniques to interpret fragments of Septuagint passages, in the manner of the &quot;midrashim&quot;. Finally, it applies biblical texts to its own contemporary historical situation in a manner reminiscent of the &quot;pesher&quot; technique found at Qumran.&quot;

The creative interpretation of Bible texts, that is most typically found in rabbinic literature and is known as midrash, appears also in the New Testament and other early Christian works, where it is utilized with the prior assumption that the whole of the Bible relates to Christ.

James L. Bailey judges as correct the classification as midrash of the frequent use by the evangelists of texts from the Hebrew Bible, and Daniel Boyarin applies this in particular to the Prologue (1:1−18) of the Gospel of John. Other instances of New Testament allegorical interpretations of the Old Testament scriptures as foreshadowing Jesus are , and . Other examples of midrash-like exegesis are found in the accounts of the temptation of Christ in Matthew and Luke, and of circumstances surrounding the birth of Jesus.

Midrashic presentation of a writer&#x27;s own views on the basis of the sacred texts was subject to well-established rules, but some scholars, due to their failure to recognize the meaning and use of midrash, have evaluated pejoratively the use of scripture by such as Matthew.

Similar negative judgments have been expressed on the abundant use of midrash in the Epistle of Barnabas. In 1867, Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, in their &quot;Ante-Nicene Christian Library&quot;, disparaged the Epistle for what it called &quot;the absurd and trifling interpretations of Scripture which it suggests&quot;.

The Epistle of Barnabas also employs another technique of ancient Jewish exegesis, that of gematria, the ascription of religious significance to the numerical value of letters. When applied to letters of the Greek alphabet, it is also called isopsephia. A well-known New Testament instance of its use is in the Book of Revelation, &quot;Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666&quot;, which is often interpreted as referring to the name &quot;Nero Caesar&quot; written in Hebrew characters. The interpretation of Genesis 17:23–27 in Barnabas 9:7–8 is considered &quot;a classic example&quot; of allegorical or midrashic interpretation: &quot;In reading the story of Abraham circumcising his household, his eye fell on the figure 318 which appeared in the scroll as ΤΙΗ. Now ΙΗ was a familiar contraction of the sacred name of Jesus, and is so written in the Alexandrian papyri of the period; and the letter Τ looked like the cross.&quot; The same gematria was adopted by Clement of Alexandria and by several other Church Fathers: William Barclay notes that, because the Greek letter Τ (tau) is shaped exactly like the &quot;crux commissa&quot; and represented the number 300, &quot;wherever the fathers came across the number 300 in the Old Testament they took it to be a mystical prefiguring of the cross of Christ&quot;.

Philip Carrington says: &quot;Barnabas can be artificial, irritating, and censorious; but it would not be fair to judge him by his less fortunate expositions. His interpretation of the unclean beasts and fishes was in line with the thought of his time, being found in the Letter of Aristeas, for instance. His numerology was also a fashionable mode of thought, though the modern scholar is often impatient with it.&quot; Robert A. Kraft states that some of the materials used by the final editor &quot;certainly antedate the year 70, and are in some sense &#x27;timeless&#x27; traditions of Hellenistic Judaism (e.g., the food law allegories of ch. 10, the Two Ways). It is with such materials that much of the importance of the epistle for our understanding of early Christianity and its late-Jewish heritage rests.&quot; The author&#x27;s style was not a personal foible: in his time it was accepted procedure in general use, although no longer in favour today. Andrew Louth says: &quot;Barnabas seems strange to modern ears: allegory is out of fashion and there is little else in the epistle. But the fashion that outlaws allegory is quite recent, and fashions change.&quot;

=== &quot;Gnosis&quot; ===
In its first chapter, the Epistle states that its intention is that the &quot;sons and daughters&quot; to whom it is addressed should have, along with their faith, perfect knowledge. The knowledge (in Greek, γνῶσις, &quot;gnosis&quot;) that the first part (chapters 1−17) aims to impart is &quot;an essentially practical γνῶσις, somewhat mystical in character, which seeks to make known the deeper sense of scripture&quot;. The first part, of an exclusively exegetical character, provides a spiritual interpretation of scripture.

The second part opens with a declaration (chapter 18:1) that it is turning to &quot;another knowledge&quot; (γνῶσις). This second &quot;gnosis&quot; is &quot;the knowledge of the will of God, the art of enumerating and specifying his commandments, and applying them to various situations&quot;, a halakhic, as opposed to an exegetical, &quot;gnosis&quot;.

The &quot;gnosis&quot; of the Epistle of Barnabas by no means links it with Gnosticism. On the contrary, it shows &quot;an implicit anti-Gnostic stance&quot;: &quot;Barnabas&#x27;s &quot;gnosis&quot; can be seen as a precursor of the &quot;gnosis&quot; of Clement of Alexandria, who distinguished the &#x27;true&#x27; &quot;gnosis&quot; from the &#x27;knowledge falsely so-called&#x27; espoused by heretics&quot;.

=== Scriptural quotations ===

Contrary to the views of Helmut Koester and Jay Curry Treat, cited above in relation to the date of composition of the Epistle, the authors of &quot;The Comprehensive New Testament&quot; say the Epistle of Barnabas quotes from the New Testament gospels twice (4:14, 5:9).

On the other hand, the Epistle abundantly cites the Old Testament in the Septuagint version, including therefore the deuterocanonical books. The Old Testament material appears as allusions and paraphrases as well as explicit quotations. However, the work in no way distinguishes its quotations from sacred scripture from its quotations from other works, some of which are now unknown. While there are agreed upon instances where the Epistle quotes from 1 Enoch, it is not clear whether other material in the Epistle that, though not an exact quotation, resembles 1 Enoch (4:3; 16:5) or 4 Esdras (12:1) attributes to the supposed sources exactly the same status as books now considered canonical. Besides, the Epistle sometimes presents as quotations what are rather free paraphrases, while at other times it gives identifiable phrases without any introductory phrase to indicate that it is quoting.

<text>El Paso International Airport (EPIA, , ) is an international airport located four miles (6 km) northeast of downtown El Paso, in El Paso County, Texas, United States. It is the busiest commercial airport in West Texas, Southern New Mexico and North Central Mexico. It handled 4,038,530 passengers in 2024, with 97,737 aircraft operations. 

ELP has two concourses, A &amp; B for a total of 15 ramps. It is a focus airport for Southwest Airlines, which accounts for over half of all passengers, and is served by 9 major airlines including Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Airlines, American, American Eagle, Delta Airlines, Frontier, United; United Express. Cargo airlines serving the airport are Amerijet International, DHL Aviation, FedEx Express, Freight Runners Express, GTA Air, and UPS Airlines. 

The airport has an array of shops and restaurants like Black Mesa, Carlos &amp; Mickey&#x27;s, Home Team Sports, Starbucks, PGA Tour Grill, Schlotzsky&#x27;s, Cinnabon, Slice, and Tia&#x27;s Mexican Restaurant.

==History==
The City of El Paso built the first El Paso Municipal Airport near the east side of the Franklin Mountains in 1928. The airport was closed by 1945 and in more recent times has been home to the Jobe Concrete Products &quot;Planeport&quot; cement factory.

In 1934, Varney Speed Lines (now United Airlines) operated at the original El Paso Municipal Airport (now closed). The original El Paso Municipal Airport construction was inspired by a visit from Charles Lindbergh.

What became today&#x27;s El Paso International Airport was built as Standard Airport by Standard Airlines in 1929 for transcontinental air mail service. Standard Airlines became a division of American Airlines in the 1930s. In 1936, American Airlines &quot;swapped&quot; airports with the City of El Paso, and El Paso International Airport was born.

During World War II, the airport was a United States Army Air Forces training base. Units which trained at El Paso Army Airfield were:
* 385th Bombardment Group (Heavy) (B-17 Flying Fortress) December 21, 1942 – February 1, 1943
** Served with the 8th Air Force in England.
* 491st Bombardment Group (Heavy) (B-24 Liberator) November 11, 1943 – January 1, 1944
** Served with the 8th Air Force in England.
* 497th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) (B-29 Superfortress) November 20–December 1, 1943
** Served with the 20th Air Force at Saipan.

On August 3, 1961, El Paso was the last stop of the first major US hijacking of a jetliner, a Boeing 707 owned by Continental Airlines.
An expansion that tripled the size of the terminal occurred in 1971. A new structure for ticketing and bag claim was built in front of the old terminal and two passenger concourses were built behind the old terminal, retaining the old terminal in the middle, the outline of which can still be recognized today. It was designed by Garland &amp; Hilles.

Serving general aviation at El Paso International Airport, Cutter Aviation established a fixed-base operation in 1982. Cutter Aviation moved to a new facility on Shuttle Columbia Drive in 2006. Atlantic Aviation also serves general aviation at ELP.

===Historical airline service===
Standard Air Lines began the first scheduled commercial passenger and mail service to El Paso on February 4, 1928, with a route to Los Angeles making stops in Douglas, Tucson, and Phoenix, Arizona. The carrier began using a Fokker F-7 aircraft and soon upgraded to a Fokker F-10 trimotor. Maddux Air Lines soon followed beginning service on February 23, 1929, with nearly the same route as Standard Air Lines however Maddux continued on from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Maddux used a Ford trimotor aircraft but the service ended later in 1929 by the time of the great stock market crash. Western Air Express replaced Standard on the route to Los Angeles for a short time in 1930 and extended service eastward from El Paso to Dallas stopping at Big Spring, Abilene, and Fort Worth, Texas. American Airways then took over the route beginning on October 15, 1930, and later extended the route eastward all the way to New York, stopping at Little Rock, Memphis, Nashville, and Washington D.C. as well as several other points. The carrier changed its name to American Airlines in 1934. Douglas DC-3 aircraft were primarily used in the latter 1930s through 1940s followed by Convair 240&#x27;s and Douglas DC-6&#x27;s in the 1950s. A new route to Monterrey and Mexico City, Mexico was flown from 1943 through 1957 and direct service to San Francisco was added in 1948. Through the 1950s, American partnered with Continental Airlines offering an interchange service where American&#x27;s flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco, stopping in Phoenix, would continue eastward through El Paso as Continental&#x27;s flights to San Antonio and Houston using the same Douglas DC-6 aircraft. The interchange flights ended in 1961 when American received its own authority to serve the El Paso-San Antonio-Houston route. American Boeing 707 and Boeing 727 jets began serving El Paso in the early 1960s and widebody Douglas DC-10 jets began service on nonstop flights to Dallas in 1972. The stop at Douglas, Arizona, on westbound flights ended in the mid-1960s and new nonstop service to Chicago was added in 1969. Direct flights to San Antonio, Houston, Tucson, and San Francisco ended after airline deregulation in 1978 and American&#x27;s service to Dallas, Chicago, Phoenix, and Los Angeles continues today.

From 1929 to 1931, Mid-Continent Air Express operated a route from El Paso to Denver stopping at Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, NM, Pueblo, and Colorado Springs. From 1931 through 1934, Western Air Express took over this route and extended it onto Cheyenne, WY. 

 Continental Airlines was the second major airline to serve El Paso. The carrier began as Varney Speed Lines in 1934 operating the northerly route from El Paso but only to Pueblo, Colorado, with stops at Albuquerque and several other points in New Mexico and Colorado. The name was changed to Continental Air Lines in 1937 and the route was extended back to Denver. A new route to Carlsbad, Hobbs, and Roswell, New Mexico, was added in 1940 followed by new routes to San Antonio and to Kansas City with several stops by the mid-1940s. Continental primarily used Lockheed Model 10 Electra and Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar aircraft in the 1930s followed by Douglas DC-3&#x27;s in the 1940s. Larger Convair 240, Convair 340, and Douglas DC-6 aircraft were introduced in the 1950s followed by the Vickers Viscount by 1959. The San Antonio route was extended to Houston by the early 1950s at which time Continental partnered with American Airlines to offer interchange service from Houston and San Antonio to Los Angeles and San Francisco by way of El Paso. Service to Alamogordo, New Mexico, was added in 1954 but discontinued in 1963, transferring the route to Frontier Airlines. New nonstop service to Dallas began in 1959, and in the early 1960s Continental received its own authority to operate westbound from El Paso to Los Angeles with stops in Tucson and Phoenix. Jet service began in the early 1960s with Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 jets on the Los Angeles-El Paso-Houston route which also made stops at Phoenix, Tucson, Midland and San Antonio. Douglas DC-9 jets arrived in 1966 which began jet service on the routes to Dallas, Albuquerque and Denver, and also the route to Kansas City that stopped in Midland, Lubbock, and Wichita Falls, Texas, as well as Lawton, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, Oklahoma. The service to the smaller cities in southeastern New Mexico ended in 1963 (retiring the DC-3 aircraft) and was transferred to Trans Texas Airlines. Continental was operating all jets by 1967 and El Paso became a small hub through the 1970s with up to five flights on the ground at a time using a new rotunda shaped gate area on the end of the east concourse. A widebody Douglas DC-10 was operated on a Los-Angeles-El Paso-San Antonio-Houston flight, eastbound only, in the latter 1970s. Service to the Mexican resort cities of Acapulco, La Paz, Los Cabos, Manzanillo, and Puerto Vallarta was operated from 1979 through 1981. After airline deregulation in 1978, Continental slowly downsized its El Paso operation to flights only serving its hubs at Denver and Houston. For a few years in the early 1990s, nonstop flights to Mexico City were operated. Continental Express service to Alamogordo, Carlsbad, and Roswell, New Mexico, was briefly operated in 1987. The Denver flights ended in 1994 and new Continental Express service with regional jets began replacing Continental&#x27;s mainline jets to Houston in the 2000s. Continental merged into United Airlines in 2012.

Trans-Texas Airways was the third carrier to serve El Paso. Trans-Texas began operating in 1947 solely within the state of Texas and El Paso was the western terminus for flights from Dallas and Houston that made many stops at small communities throughout central and west Texas. Trans-Texas operated Douglas DC-3 aircraft and flights from El Paso would stop at Marfa, Alpine, Pecos, Ft. Stockton, and several other communities. In 1963, new routes were established to Carlsbad, Hobbs, and Roswell, New Mexico while the initial routes to most of the small Texas cities were discontinued. Larger Convair 240 and Convair 600 aircraft replaced the DC-3&#x27;s in the mid-1960s. In 1969 the carrier changed its name to Texas International Airlines and new Douglas DC-9 jets began flights from El Paso to Houston making stops in Midland, San Angelo and Austin. These flights ended in 1971. For the next several years only a single flight to Carlsbad, Hobbs, Big Spring, Brownwood, and Dallas was operated using a Convair-600. A DC-9 jet flight to Dallas, stopping in Roswell and Midland, operated for a period in 1975. All service to El Paso ended in 1977 but was reinstated in 1980 when nonstop jet flights to Dallas began. Texas International merged into Continental Airlines in 1982 at which time the Dallas flights ended.

Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) began a route from El Paso to Phoenix in 1950 that made stops in Las Cruses, Deming, Silver City and Lordsburg, New Mexico, as well as Clifton, Safford, Globe and Superior, Arizona. Douglas DC-3 aircraft were used and the service ended in 1955. Frontier returned to El Paso in 1963 with a route to Alamogordo and Albuquerque, New Mexico, which eventually continued to Salt Lake City. Convair 580 aircraft were used on this route and in 1967 Frontier began nonstop flights to Albuquerque and onto Denver with Boeing 727 jets. The 727&#x27;s were later swapped out with Boeing 737-200 jets and new service to several points in Mexico was established from 1978 through 1984. These Mexican destinations included Guadalajara, Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Manzanillo, Mazatlán, and Puerto Vallarta. Frontier ceased operating in 1986, and a new Frontier Airlines was established in 1994 with Boeing 737 flights to Albuquerque and Denver.

Southwest Airlines began flights from El Paso to Dallas, Lubbock, and Midland/Odessa in 1977 using Boeing 737-200&#x27;s and continually added new service, becoming the largest carrier at El Paso by the early 1980s. Delta Airlines and United Airlines also began service in the 1980s.

Since airline deregulation went into effect in late 1978, many other carriers have served El Paso including Eastern Airlines, Western Airlines, America West Airlines, USAir, Northwest Airlines, TWA, Aerolitoral (feeder carrier for AeroMexico), and Lineas Aereas Azteca. At least 15 smaller commuter airlines have also provided service to points in southern New Mexico, southeast Arizona, and to Chihuahua, Mexico, from the 1960s through the 1990s.

==Facilities==

El Paso International Airport covers 6,670 acres (2,699 ha) and has three runways:
* 4/22: , asphalt
* 8R/26L: , asphalt
* 8L/26R: , asphalt

===Main terminal===

The terminal is a pier-satellite layout. It has a central entrance and the gates branch out east to west on the two concourses. The airport has East and West Concourses. Gates A1–A4 are located on the West Concourse and Gates B1–B11 is located on the East Concourse. The airport has a total of 15 gates. There is also a lower and upper level. The gates are located on the upper level and the ticketing, baggage claim, rental car, and main entrance are located on the lower level of the terminal. The meeter/greeter area is located on the lower level just behind the escalators that lead to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoint leading to the gates. The corridor from the ticketing/baggage claim to the gate concourses passes through the old terminal which is used today for airport administration. Major terminal renovations have been made over the past several years, designed and managed by the local architectural firm MNK Architects.

The airport access road is Convair Road. Convair Road splits into four lanes with the left two lanes reserved for commercial vehicles and the right two lanes utilized for pickup and drop-off of passengers. In between the split road there is a waiting area where passengers can wait for commercial vehicles to arrive.

Gates:
Generally, these gates are used by:
Gates A1–A4: American Airlines and American Eagle.
Gate B1: Delta Air Lines.
Gates B3, B5-B7: Southwest Airlines
Gate B10 Allegiant. 
Gates B8 and B9: United Airlines and United Express.
Gate B10: Alaska. 
Gate B11: Frontier.

Food court:
The food court is between gates B6 and B11; it has Carlos and Mickey&#x27;s Mexican Express, Slice, Tia&#x27;s, Schlotzsky&#x27;s, Cinnabon and Starbucks.

===Other facilities===
The El Paso Independent School District (EPISD) began leasing a property on the grounds of the airport in 1963 to house its administrative headquarters. By the 2010s the City of El Paso desired the use of the property for airport expansion, but chose to defer the original 2014 expiration of the lease to at least December 31, 2019 so EPISD had time to find a new headquarters location. In 2021 the current EPISD headquarters in Downtown El Paso opened.

==Ground Transportation==
Sun Metro routes 33 and 208 pick up outside the terminal. A connection at the Eastside Terminal to the 50 or 59 bus is required to get to Amtrak and the El Paso Streetcar. 

==Airlines and destinations==
El Paso International Airport has 15 gates on 2 concourses: Concourse A (used exclusively by American) has gates A1–A4 and Concourse B has gates B1–B11.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On August 31, 1957, a USAF Douglas C-124 Globemaster II struck the ground while on approach in poor weather 2.5 miles NE of ELP. Five out of the 15 occupants on board died.
* On July 20, 1982, Douglas C-47D N102BL of Pronto Aviation Services was damaged beyond repair in a crash landing near El Paso International Airport following an engine failure shortly after take-off. The aircraft was on a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight to Tucson International Airport in Arizona when the engine failed and the decision was made to return to El Paso. A single-engine go-around was attempted following an unsafe landing gear warning.
*On February 19, 1988, Don McCoy, a private pilot, the owner of El Paso Sand and Gravel, took off in a newly acquired Rockwell Aero Commander 680 in a snowstorm (an aircraft he was not properly rated to fly), and attempted to land again after encountering mechanical trouble in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The aircraft crashed, killing the owner and two acquaintances. Some later attempted to attribute the accident to US Senator Phil Gramm, as it was alleged that McCoy planned to testify against Senator Gramm&#x27;s shakedown of campaign contributions made by the El Paso Small Business Administration office.
*On January 16, 2006, Continental Airlines Flight 1515, (Registered as N32626 for both Continental and United), a Boeing 737-524 bound for Houston, was undergoing a pre-flight inspection when a mechanic (Donald Gene Buchanan) was sucked into the right engine and killed. The aircraft sustained minor damage.
* On April 11, 2015, a Southwest Airlines jet was directed by the tower at ELP to land on a closed runway under construction. The aircraft landed safely but missed construction equipment by &quot;mere feet&quot;.
* On June 3, 2018, American Airlines Flight 1897, an Airbus A319 aircraft from San Antonio to Phoenix, was diverted to El Paso due to damage sustained by the aircraft after running into a hail storm in flight. The plane was able to land normally, and no injuries were reported.

<doc id="269630" wikidata="Q504073" url="?curid=269630" title="Stencil">
<text>Stencilling produces an image or pattern on a surface by applying pigment to a surface through an intermediate object, with designed holes in the intermediate object. The holes allow the pigment to reach only some parts of the surface creating the design. The stencil is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object; the context in which &quot;stencil&quot; is used makes clear which meaning is intended. In practice, the (object) stencil is usually a thin sheet of material, such as paper, plastic, wood or metal, with letters or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cut-out holes in the material.

The key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design. Although aerosol or painting stencils can be made for one-time use, typically they are made with the intention of being reused. To be reusable, they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface. With some designs, this is done by connecting stencil islands (sections of material that are inside cut-out &quot;holes&quot; in the stencil) to other parts of the stencil with bridges (narrow sections of material that are not cut out).

Stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as pochoir. A related technique (which has found applicability in some surrealist compositions) is aerography, in which spray-painting is done &quot;around&quot; a three-dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting handprint outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment.

Screen printing also uses a stencil process, as does mimeography. The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called &quot;stencils&quot;. Stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and mimeography, the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi-colored images.

==History==

Hand stencils, made by blowing pigment over a hand held against a wall, are found from over 35,000 years ago in Asia and Europe, and later prehistoric dates in other continents. After that stenciling has been used as a historic painting technique on all kinds of materials. 
Stencils may have been used to color cloth for a very long time; the technique probably reached its peak of sophistication in Katazome and other techniques used on silks for clothes during the Edo period in Japan. In Europe, from about 1450 they were commonly used to color old master prints printed in black and white, usually woodcuts. This was especially the case with playing-cards, which continued to be colored by stencil long after most other subjects for prints were left in black and white. Stencils were used for mass publications, as the type did not have to be hand-written.

==Book illustration==

Stencils were popular as a method of book illustration, and for that purpose, the technique was at its height of popularity in France during the 1920s when André Marty, Jean Saudé and many other studios in Paris specialized in the technique. Low wages contributed to the popularity of the highly labor-intensive process. When stencils are used in this way they are often called &quot;pochoir&quot;.
In the pochoir process, a print with the outlines of the design was produced, and a series of stencils were used through which areas of color were applied by hand to the page. To produce detail, a collotype could be produced which the colors were then stenciled over. Pochoir was frequently used to create prints of intense color and is most often associated with Art Nouveau and Art Deco design.

==Aerosol stencils==

Aerosol stencils have many practical applications and the stencil concept is used frequently in industrial, commercial, artistic, residential and recreational settings, as well as by the military, government and infrastructure management. A template is used to create an outline of the image. Stencils templates can be made from any material which will hold its form, ranging from plain paper, cardboard, plastic sheets, metals, and wood.

===Official use===
Stencils are frequently used by official organizations, including the military, utility companies, and governments, to quickly and clearly label objects, vehicles, and locations. Stencils for an official application can be customized, or purchased as individual letters, numbers, and symbols. This allows the user to arrange words, phrases and other labels from one set of templates, unique to the item being labeled. When objects are labeled using a single template alphabet, it makes it easier to identify their affiliation or source.

===Stencil graffiti===

Stencils have also become popular for graffiti, since stencil art using spray-paint can be produced quickly and easily. These qualities are important for graffiti artists where graffiti is illegal or quasi-legal, depending on the city and stenciling surface. The extensive lettering possible with stencils makes it especially attractive to political artists. For example, the anarcho-punk band Crass used stencils of anti-war, anarchist, feminist and anti-consumerist messages in a long-term graffiti campaign around the London Underground system and on advertising billboards. There has been a semi-recent trend in making multi-layered stencils with different shades of grey for each layer creating a more detailed stenciled image. Also well known for their use of stencil art are Blek le Rat, Epsylon, Marie Rouffet, Nuklé-art, Kim Prisu, Miss Tic and Jef aerosol from France, British artist Banksy, New York artist, world traveling artist Tavar Zawacki f.k.a. &#x27;ABOVE&#x27;, Shepard Fairey&#x27;s OBEY, and Pirate &amp; Acid from Hollywood, California.

==Home stenciling ==
A common tradition for stencils is in home decorating and arts &amp; crafts. Home decor stencils are an important part of the DIY (Do It Yourself) industry. There are prefabricated stencil templates available for home decoration projects from hardware stores, arts &amp; crafts stores and through the internet. Stencils are usually applied in the home with a paint or roller brush along wall borders and as trim. They can also be applied with a painted sponge for a textured effect.

Stencil templates can be purchased or constructed individually. Typically they are constructed of flexible plastics, including acetate, mylar, and vinyl. Stencils can be used as children&#x27;s toys.

==Military stenciling==
Stencils have been used in the military across most nations for many years and continue to be used today. They are used to mark up equipment, vehicles, rations, signposts, helmets, etc. One use of military stencils was the application of playing card designs to USA Airborne helmets during World War Two as a method to identify regimental units.

==Silk screening==

Silk screening is a type of printing on paper or textiles, in which an ink is embedded in the cloth. The ink is controlled through the use of a stencil, which is placed directly over the paper or textile. This process can only handle one color of ink at a time. Therefore, multi-colored designs must be silk screened several times, with each interval taking time to dry.

==Micro- and nanostencil==
Stencils are also used in micro- and nanotechnology, as miniature shadow masks through which material can be deposited, etched or ions implanted onto a substrate. These stencils are usually made out of thin (100-500 nm) low-stress Silicon nitride (SiN) in which apertures are defined by various lithographic techniques (e. g. electron beam, photolithography).

Stencil lithography has unique advantages compared to other patterning techniques: it does not require spinning of a uniform layer of resist (therefore patterns can be created on 3D topographies) and it does not involve any heat or chemical treatment of the substrate (like baking, developing and removing the resist). Thus it allows a wide range of substrates (e.g. flexible, surface-treated) and materials (e. g. organics) to be used.

==Other stencil forms==
===Screen printing===
A stencil technique is employed in screen printing which uses a tightly woven mesh screen coated in a thin layer of emulsion to reproduce the original image. As the stencil is attached to the screen, a contiguous template is not necessary.

===Airbrushing===

A stencil used in airbrushing called a frisket is pressed directly on the artwork. It can be used to control or contain overspray, create sharp or complex shapes, but is not designed to be used more than once.

===Wall stencils===
Wall stencils - to decorate walls and ceilings or create your own repeat for an overall modern wall pattern effect.

===Rock art===

One form of pictograph found in ancient and traditional rock paintings is created by the hand first being placed against the panel, with dry paint then being blown onto it through a tube, in a process that is akin to air-brush or spray-painting. The resulting image is a negative print of the hand, and is sometimes described as a &quot;stencil&quot; in Australian archaeology.

Miniature rock art of the stencilled variety at a rock shelter known as Yilbilinji, in the Limmen National Park in the Northern Territory, is one of only three known examples of such art. Usually stencilled art is life-size, using body parts as the stencil, but the 17 images of designs of human figures, boomerangs, animals such as crabs and long-necked turtles, wavy lines and geometric shapes are very rare. Found in 2017 by archaeologists, the only other recorded examples are at Nielson&#x27;s Creek in New South Wales and at Kisar Island in Indonesia. It is thought that the designs may have been created by stencils fashioned out of beeswax.

<text>San Antonio International Airport is an international airport in San Antonio, Texas, United States. It is in Uptown Central San Antonio, about north of Downtown. It has three runways and covers . Its elevation is above sea level. SAT averages 260 daily departures and arrivals at its 27 gates, which serve 14 airlines flying non-stop to 45 destinations in the US and Mexico. The airport is the 44th busiest airport in the United States by passenger traffic.

==History==
===Beginnings===
San Antonio International Airport was founded in 1941 when the City of San Antonio purchased of undeveloped land that was then north of the city limits (now part of the city&#x27;s Uptown District) for a project to be called &quot;San Antonio Municipal Airport.&quot; World War II wartime needs meant the airport was not fully finished till after the war. 

A large portion of the northeast section of the airport was pressed into federal government service. This area was known as Alamo Field and was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a training base. The 77th Reconnaissance Group, equipped with various aircraft (P-39, P-40, A-20, B-25, O-47, O-52, and L-5) trained reconnaissance personnel who later served overseas. One squadron (113th) flew antisubmarine patrols over the Gulf of Mexico.

The first airline to serve the airport was Braniff Airlines in 1943, followed by American Airlines the following year. In 1944 the airports name was changed from San Antonio Municipal Airport to the current name of San Antonio International Airport. At the end of World War II the Alamo Field portion of the airport was no longer needed by the military and was turned over to the City of San Antonio for civil use. Terminal 2 was built in 1951–53, along with the FAA control tower and a baggage claim area. For HemisFair &#x27;68, a new satellite concourse was built, containing eight jet bridge gates and passenger waiting areas. In June 1971, the airport was one of three original destinations along with Dallas and Houston for new startup Southwest Airlines.

===Expansion for a growing city===
In 1975 the city adopted its first Airport Master Plan with plans for a new 1,300 space parking garage and a new Terminal (formerly called Terminal 1, now called Terminal A). Once the new terminal was completed in 1984 it brought the airport&#x27;s capacity up from eight gates to 27 gates. In 1986 a new FAA air traffic control tower was built at a new location.

In 1994 a second Airport Master Plan was developed that would take the airport into the 21st century. This plan included major updates for the airport: more parking spaces in a 3,000 space parking garage to be completed by 2007, improved airport access and an improved concession program. Two new terminals were planned to replace Terminal 2, to increase the airports gate count to 35. San Antonio boarded over 3.5 million passenger in 1999. Since 1966, the airport has boarded more than 80 million people.
===Recent history===
From February to September 2006, the airport was a focus city for United Airlines (the airline called it a &quot;hublet&quot;) with flights to 12 cities in conjunction with partner Trans States Airlines. Trans States Airlines redeployed its aircraft elsewhere, eliminating service to seven cities. 

Mexicana celebrated 50 years serving the airport in September 2007, but suspended service to San Antonio in August 2010 when the airline went bankrupt and suspended operations. From April 2007 to September 2008 ExpressJet operated a focus city under its own branded operations at the airport. Many of the cities served were ones previously operated during the United Airlines focus city the previous year. All service ended when ExpressJet folded its branded operations.

On November 9, 2010, the original Terminal 2 closed, and Terminal B opened. Terminal 1 was then renamed Terminal A. The removal of fixtures in the old Terminal 2 began in January 2011. Final demolition of Terminal 2 was in May 2011. In 2013, the SAT Customs and Border Protection became a Global Entry enrollment center.

In June 2015, officials announced that the three-story short-term parking garage, which was over 30 years old, would be closed and demolished to make way for a new seven-story parking garage and Consolidated Rental Car Center. Work began in early 2017 on the 1.8 million square feet facility, which was planned to house up to 14 rental car brands and short-term public parking. The public parking portion was completed in April 2017, and the rental car portion opened in January 2018. The airport received its first nonstop flight to Europe in May 2024, with German airline Condor launching seasonal service to Frankfurt. The flight was pulled a few months later.

== Expansion ==
Beginning in 2023 with a scheduled completion in 2028, the airport will complete a new terminal, renovate the existing Terminal A, and upgrade the airfield and roadways to accommodate the projected growth and needs of passengers. 

The new Terminal C will feature up to 17 domestic and international gates, with six of the gates able to accommodate wide-body aircraft. The new terminal will be about the same size as the current two terminals combined, providing ample room for new concession space, club lounges, and a modern federal inspection station for expanded international air service. It will also contain a central passenger screening area for all terminals. 

Terminal A will be renovated with state-of-the-art systems and a wider concourse. New roadways will improve traffic flow and remove congestion.
===Current projects===
Construction began October 2023 on a Ground Load Facility expected to be completed by early 2025. The facility will be connected to the current Terminal A. It will contain three ground load gate positions, along with retail and food options. The facility is geared towards ultra low-cost airlines such as Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines.

===Terminals===
San Antonio International Airport has two terminals with an overall 27 jet bridge gates. The original one-level terminal (formerly Terminal 2) opened in 1953 with ground-loading holding areas and was expanded twice, once in 1959 with new east and west wings, and again in 1968 with an eight-gate satellite concourse, which was built to handle visitors to HemisFair &#x27;68. Terminal 2 closed on November 9, 2010, as the new Terminal B opened, and Terminal 2 began to be demolished in March 2011, with completion in January 2012. A second terminal (now Terminal A) opened in 1984 with a 16-gate concourse. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility is located in Terminal A.

Terminal A is the larger of the two concourses, with 17 gates in total. All international carriers operate out of Terminal A. On June 18, 2014, a $35.6 million renovation was completed for this terminal, with the most visible improvements to passengers being new terrazzo floors, updated food courts, and new signage. On October 15, 2014, all gates in Terminal A were renumbered in sequential order. 12 of the current 14 airlines serving the airport operate from Terminal A, including the Airport&#x27;s largest airline by passengers and routes served, Southwest Airlines.

Terminal B opened in November 2010, containing eight gates. Corgan Associates, Inc. and 3D/International designed the new terminal. American and Continental were the two original airlines at Terminal B. United, at the time located in Terminal A, moved into Terminal B on August 1, 2012, during the merger with Continental. A United Club is located between gates B3 and B5. The USO is located on the arrivals level of Terminal B next to baggage claim. In 2022 construction began to add two more gates to Terminal B in order to better accommodate increasing passenger numbers. Construction was completed in January 2023, bringing the total gates for Terminal B to ten.

==Ground transportation==
The airport has a 1.8 million square foot consolidated rental car facility that was completed in January 2018. The facility is reached via a sky bridge from the mezzanine level of Terminal B.

The airport is located near the intersection of Interstate 410 and U.S. 281 in Uptown Central San Antonio. U.S. 281 provides quick drives (under 15 minutes in normal traffic) to Downtown and northern San Antonio. Interstate 410, a loop, makes the rest of the city easily accessible.

VIA Metropolitan Transit provides weekday express bus service from the airport directly to Downtown and a park &amp; ride facility in Stone Oak on Route 7; Route 5 provides local bus service and transfers to other routes at the North Star Transit Center.

==Other facilities==

ST Engineering maintains a large presence at the airport knows as SAA (San Antonio Aerospace) employing around 1,000 staff. The facilities were previously owned by Dee Howard Aircraft Maintenance and were purchased during the company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2002. The facility provides heavy maintenance and other services for numerous passenger and cargo airlines along with aircraft leasing operations. The most recent addition being a passenger to cargo conversion line for Airbus A320 series family.

<doc id="269637" wikidata="Q49617" url="?curid=269637" title="The Internationale">
<text>&quot;The Internationale&quot; is an international anthem that has been adopted as the anthem of various anarchist, communist, socialist, democratic socialist, and social democratic movements. It has been a standard of the socialist movement since the late nineteenth century, when the Second International adopted it as its official anthem. The title arises from the &quot;First International&quot;, an alliance of workers founded by Karl Marx and others, which held a congress in 1864. The author of the anthem&#x27;s lyrics, Eugène Pottier, a member of the French branch of the organization, attended this congress. Pottier&#x27;s text was later set to an original melody composed by Pierre De Geyter, a member of the Parti Ouvrier Français (French Workers Party) in Lille in industrial northern France.

== Lyrics ==

The song in its original French version was written in June 1871 by Eugène Pottier, a member of the First International and Paris Commune, after the Commune had been crushed by the French army on 28 May but before Pottier fled first to Britain and then later (1873-1881) to the United States. Pottier intended it to be sung to the tune of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;. The song was reputedly sung to the &quot;Marseillaise&quot; at Pottier&#x27;s burial in November 1887. Only the following year, the melody to which &quot;The Internationale&quot; is usually sung, was composed by Pierre De Geyter for the choir &quot;La Lyre des Travailleurs&quot; of the French Worker&#x27;s Party in his hometown of Lille, and the first performed there in July 1888.
De Geyter had been commissioned by Gustave Delory the future mayor of Lille, who had received the text from a young socialist teacher, Charles Gros.

Pottier wrote an earlier version of the song in September 1870, to celebrate the Third Republic declared after the defeat of the Second French Empire by Prussia and the abdication of Napoleon III, and to honor the First International; this version was reprinted in 1988, the centennial of Degeyter&#x27;s musical setting, by the historian of Commune song, Robert Brécy.. 
Contemporary editions published by Boldoduc (Lille) in 1888, by Delory in 1894, and by Lagrange in 1898 are no longer locatable, but the text that endures is the one authorized by Pottier for his &quot;Chants Révolutionnaires&quot;, published by his Communard colleague Jean Allemane in April 1887, before Pottier&#x27;s death in November, and reprinted in Pottier&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot;. This version, along with a facsimile reprint of De Geyter&#x27;s score and translations into English and other languages, also appears in the only English-language selection of Pottier&#x27;s works, edited by Loren Kruger.

Pottiers&#x27;s lyrics contain one-liners that became very popular and found widespread use as slogans; other lines such as &quot;Ni Dieu, ni César, ni tribun&quot; (&quot;Neither God, nor Caesar, nor tribune&quot;) were already well-known in the workers&#x27; movement. The success of the song is connected to the stability and widespread popularity of the Second International. Like the lyrics, the music by De Geyter was relatively simple and down to earth, suitable for a workers&#x27; audience.

===French original===
===Authorship and copyright===
In a successful attempt to save Pierre De Geyter&#x27;s job as a woodcarver, the 6,000 leaflets printed by Lille printer Boldoduc only mentioned the French version of his family name (Degeyter).
The second edition published by Delory named Pierre&#x27;s brother Adolphe as the composer.
With neither money nor representation, Pierre De Geyter lost his first lawsuit over this in 1914 and did not gain legal recognition of authorship until 1922 when he was 74.
His brother had in the meantime died by suicide in 1916, leaving a note to Pierre explaining the fraud and stating that Delory had manipulated him into claiming authorship; and Delory had inscribed on Adolphe&#x27;s tombstone &quot;Ici repose Adolphe Degeyter, l&#x27;auteur de &quot;L&#x27;Internationale&quot;&quot;.
Despite this dying declaration, historians in the 1960s such as Daniel Ligou were still contending that Adolphe was the author.

In 1972, &quot;Montana Edition&quot;, owned by Hans R. Beierlein, bought the rights to the song for 5,000 Deutschmark, first for the territory of West Germany, then in East Germany, then worldwide. East Germany paid Montana Edition 20,000 DM every year for its rights to play the music. Pierre De Geyter died in 1932, causing the copyrights to expire in 2002. Luckhardt&#x27;s German text is the public domain since 1984.

As &quot;The Internationale&quot; music was published before 1 July 1909 outside the United States, it is in the public domain in the United States. As of 2013, Pierre De Geyter&#x27;s music is also in the public domain in countries and areas whose copyright durations are authors&#x27; lifetime plus 80 years or less. Due to France&#x27;s wartime copyright extensions (&quot;prorogations de Guerre&quot;), SACEM claimed that the music was still copyrighted in France until October 2014. The &quot;Internationale&quot; is now also in the public domain within France.

As Eugène Pottier died in 1887, his original French lyrics are in the public domain. Gustave Delory once acquired the copyright of his lyrics through the songwriter Jean-Baptiste Clement having bought it from Pottier&#x27;s widow.

==Translations==
There have been a very wide variety of translations of the anthem. In 2002, Kuznar notes that the nature of these translations has varied widely. Many have been closely literal translations with variations solely to account for rhyme and meter but others have been done to encode different ideology perspectives and or to &quot;update&quot; contents to adapt the lyrics to relevant more contemporary issues.

The first English version has been attributed to the author Eugène Pottier himself, produced apparently after he fled the fall of the Paris Commune in June 1871 for temporary exile in Britain (until 1873, when he went on to the United States). The first U.S. translation was by Charles Hope Kerr who heard it in De Geyter&#x27;s setting in Lille in 1894 and published it as a pamphlet that year: it was later reproduced in &quot;Songs of the IWW&quot;, first published in 1909 and has been reprinted by Kerr&#x27;s publishing house into the 21st century. The first of many Italian versions signed by E. Bergeret, identified as Ettore Marroni, in 1901. Dutch communist poet Henriette Roland Holst translated it into Dutch, with &quot;Ontwaakt, verworpenen der aarde&quot; (&#x27;Wake up, all who are cast away&#x27;) at about the same time. By the time of the 1910 International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen, versions had appeared in 18 different languages, including a Danish one by A. C. Meyer, which was sung at the end of a cantata by 500 singers.

=== Russian version used in the Soviet Union ===
The Russian version was initially translated by Arkady Kots in 1902 and printed in London in &quot;Zhizn,&quot; a Russian émigré magazine. The first Russian version had only three stanzas, based on stanzas 1, 2, and 6 of the original, and the refrain. After the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, the text was slightly re-worded to get rid of &quot;now useless&quot; future tenses – particularly the refrain was reworded (the future tense was replaced by the present, and the first person plural possessive pronoun was introduced). In 1918, the chief editor of &quot;Izvestia&quot;, Yuri Steklov, appealed to Russian writers to translate the other three stanzas, which did eventually happen.

The Russian Internationale has been translated into many indigenous languages of Russia, namely Tatar, Bashkir, Chuvash, Chukchi, Udmurt, and Yakut.

==== Soviet cinema and theatre ====
Dmitry Shostakovich used &quot;The Internationale&quot; twice for the movie soundtrack to the 1936 Soviet movie &quot;Girl Friends&quot;, once performed by a military-style band when a group of women are preparing for war, and a second time as a solo performance on a theremin.

Nikolai Evreinov&#x27;s 1920 &quot;The Storming of the Winter Palace&quot; used both &quot;The Internationale&quot; and &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; symbolically in opposition to each other, with the former sung by the &quot;Red platform&quot; proletariat side and the latter sung by the &quot;White platform&quot; government side, the former starting weakly and in disarray but gradually becoming organised and drowning out the latter.

==== Toscanini and &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot; ====
The change of the Soviet Union&#x27;s national anthem from &quot;The Internationale&quot; to the &quot;State Anthem of the USSR&quot; was a factor in the production of the 1944 movie &quot;Hymn of the Nations&quot;, which made use of an orchestration of &quot;The Internationale&quot; that Arturo Toscanini had already done the year before for a 1943 NBC radio broadcast commemorating the twenty-sixth anniversary of the October Revolution.

It was incorporated into Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Inno delle nazioni&quot; alongside the national anthems of the United Kingdom (already in the original) and the United States (incorporated by Toscanini for a prior radio broadcast of the &quot;Inno&quot; in January of that year) to signify the side of the Allies during World War Two.

Toscanini&#x27;s son Walter remarked that an Italian audience for the movie would see the significance of Arturo being willing to play these anthems and unwilling to play &quot;Giovinezza&quot; and the &quot;Marcia Reale&quot; because of his anti-Fascist political views.
Alexandr Hackenschmied, the film&#x27;s director, expressed his view that the song was &quot;ormai archeologico&quot; (nearly archaeological), but this was a countered in a letter by Walter Toscanini to Giuseppe Antonio Borgese, rejecting the objections of Borgese, Hackenschmied, and indeed the Office of War Information.

At the time, Walter stated that he believed that &quot;The Internationale&quot; had widespread relevance across Europe, and in 1966 he recounted in correspondence that the OWI had &quot;panicked&quot; when it had learned of the Soviet Union&#x27;s plans, but Arturo had issued an ultimatum that if &quot;The Internationale&quot;, &quot;l&#x27;inno di tutte le glebe ed i lavoratori di tutto il mondo&quot; (the anthem of the working classes of the whole world) was not included, that if the already done orchestration and performance were not used as-is, then they should forget about distributing the film entirely.

The inclusion of &quot;The Internationale&quot; in the Toscaninis&#x27; minds was not simply for the sake of a Soviet Union audience, but because of its relevance to all countries of the world. Although Walter did not consider &quot;The Internationale&quot; to be &quot;good music&quot;, he considered it to be (as he stated to the OWI) &quot;more than the hymn of a nation or a party&quot; and &quot;an idea of brotherhood&quot;.

It would have been expensive to re-record a new performance of the &quot;Inno&quot; without &quot;The Internationale&quot;, and thus it remained in the movie as originally released.
Some time during the McCarthy Era, however, it was edited out of re-released copies, and remained so until a 1988 Library of Congress release on video, which restored &quot;The Internationale&quot; to the movie.

==== Winston Churchill and &quot;National Anthems of the Allies&quot; ====
A similar situation had occurred earlier in the war with the BBC&#x27;s popular weekly Sunday evening radio broadcast, preceding the Nine O&#x27;Clock News, titled &quot;National Anthems of the Allies&quot;, whose playlist was all of the national anthems of the countries allied with the United Kingdom, the list growing with each country that Germany invaded. After the Germans began their invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), it was fully expected that &quot;The Internationale&quot;, as the anthem of the Soviet Union, would be included in the playlist that day, but to people&#x27;s surprise it was not, neither that week nor the week after. Winston Churchill, a staunch opponent of communism, had immediately sent word to the BBC via Anthony Eden that &quot;The PM has issued an instruction to the Ministry of Information that the Internationale is &quot;on no account&quot; to be played by the B.B.C.&quot; (emphasis in the original).

Newspapers such as the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Daily Mail&quot; were sharply critical of the Foreign Office, and questions were asked in the House of Commons. Ambassador Ivan Maisky recorded in his diary a conversation with Duff Cooper on 11 July 1941 where Cooper asked him if the music played after Vyacheslav Molotov&#x27;s speech on 22 June would be acceptable to the Soviet Union, and he replied that it would not be. (The music was Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot;.) On the evening of 13 July, the BBC instead played, in Maisky&#x27;s words, &quot;a very beautiful but little-known Soviet song&quot;, which he described as demonstrating &quot;the British Government&#x27;s cowardice and foolishness&quot;. Rather than risk offending the Soviet Union by continuing to pointedly refuse to play its national anthem in a radio programme entitled &quot;National Anthems&quot;, the BBC discontinued the programme. Six months later, on 22 January 1942, Churchill relented and lifted the prohibition.

This relaxation enabled &quot;The Internationale&quot; to be used in wartime broadcasts and films, and at public occasions, thereafter. The BBC&#x27;s 1943 &quot;Salute to the Red Army&quot; had a mass performance of &quot;The Internationale&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall by the choir of the Royal Choral Society, the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and military bands, in front of the flag of the Soviet Union and following a speech by Anthony Eden. The day before, which was Red Army Day, troops and the audience had sung &quot;The Internationale&quot; to the Lord Mayor of Bristol. The 1944 movie &quot;Tawny Pipit&quot; depicted schoolchildren in the fictional village of Lipton Lea welcoming the character Olga Boclova (based upon Ludmilla Pavlichenko) to their town by singing &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

=== China ===
Qu Qiubai revised the translation of the lyrics into Chinese after having attended the Fourth Conference of Comintern in November 1921 and having not been able to join in the spontaneous singing by attendees there of &quot;The Internationale&quot; in their various home languages with their own Chinese rendition because the Chinese attendees did not have a good one.
He proceeded, according to the political memoirs of his contemporaries, in 1923 to re-translate the lyrics from the original French at the organ in his cousin&#x27;s home in Beijing, publishing them in &quot;New Youth&quot;, a journal of which he was the editor-in-chief.

This has become part of the cultural narrative of Qu&#x27;s life, including in a 2001 television dramatisation of events, &quot;The Sun Rises from the East&quot;, where Qu is depicted as explaining to Cai Hesen that the former did not translate the song&#x27;s title because he wished to make the Chinese version, which used a phonetic rendering of the French name using Chinese words &quot;yingtenaixiongnaier&quot;, accessible to a multi-lingual non-Chinese-speaking audience.
The television dramatisation included excerpts from the movie &quot;Lenin in October&quot;, a popular movie in China during the time of Mao with scenes that were set to &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

&quot;Lenin in October&quot; was one of several movies from Soviet cinema translated into Chinese in the 1950s that led to the widespread popularity of &quot;The Internationale&quot; in the early years of the PRC.
Others include &quot;Lenin in 1918&quot;, a 1939 movie which came to China in 1951, with &quot;The Internationale&quot; abruptly terminated at the point in the movie that Lenin is shot by an assassin; and the 1952 &quot;The Unforgettable 1919&quot; which came to China that same year and used &quot;The Internationale&quot; for a mass rally scene involving Joseph Stalin.

Chinese movies about martyrs to the CCP cause would begin to incorporate the song into pivotal scenes later in the 1950s, this use peaking in the 1960s with inclusion into such movies as the 1965 &quot;Living Forever in Burning Flames&quot; depicting the execution of Jiang Jie.

In the 1956 film &quot;Mother&quot;, the character Lao Deng, a local revolutionary leader, is depicted singing &quot;The Internationale&quot; on the way to his execution, and in the 1960 &quot;A Revolutionary Family&quot;, the son of the protagonist (in chorus with his fellow prisoners) also sings &quot;The Internationale&quot; on the way to his execution. It would become a leitmotif of Chinese Revolutionary (model) cinema.

Political memoirs of Li Dazhao&#x27;s daughter Li Xinghua recount his explaining the lyrics of the song to her, he having encountered it on his travels with Qu in 1923 and during his visit to Moscow the following year.
He also encouraged people to sing it during socialist activism training sessions in 1925 and 1926.
As with Qu, the song forms part of the cultural narrative of his life, it being the widely accepted account of his execution in 1927 that he sang the song in the last moments of his life.

As with Qu and Li, the song is found in many places in political histories of CCP leaders and martyrs to its cause, symbolising their socialist ideals, including Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping.
It has also seen continued, and sometimes contradictory, uses over the decades as politics in China have changed, such as (for one example) Chen Yun&#x27;s use in the 1960s to justify a new agricultural land allocation policy.
It has maintained its status as a de facto CCP anthem, and its continued relevance over the decades can be seen in its inclusion in all three of the 1964 &quot;The East Is Red&quot;, the 1984 &quot;The Song of the Chinese Revolution&quot;, and the 2009 &quot;The Road to Prosperity&quot;.

While the song has a wide influence as an adjunct of official ideology, it has also been used in counter-cultural movements, such as the demonstrators in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests singing it during their final retreat.
Barbara Mittler maintains that this dual use of &quot;The Internationale&quot; by the government and by people demonstrating against it disproves any hypothesis that &quot;a certain type of music &#x27;depicts&#x27; a certain social environment&quot;.

&quot;The Internationale&quot; continues to be popular with 21st century Chinese audiences, as exemplified by its reception by audience when sung at the second curtain call of the &quot;Shocking&quot; concert of Liu Han, Liao Changyong, and Mo Hualun.

Qu was hired as a translator for students at the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow, where he met Xiao San in 1922, who had newly arrived from France.
There, Xiao was drawn into the performing arts as a vehicle for revolutionary messages and, in conjunction with other students, translated &quot;The Internationale&quot; and several Soviet songs from the original French and Russian into Chinese, separately from Qu&#x27;s work in Beijing in 1923.
Xiao re-worked his translation in 1939, adding to it an explanatory history.
Ironically, the translation in the television dramatisation &quot;The Sun Rises from the East&quot; that is recited by the character of Qu, is not in reality Qu&#x27;s translation at all, but is the 1949 official approved translation based upon Xiao&#x27;s, that is additionally credited to Zheng Zhenduo.

The 2004 movie &quot;My Years in France&quot;, a biographical film of Deng Xiaoping, re-framed this history into a dramatic scene, set in 1920s Paris before Xiao leaves for Moscow, in which Zhou Enlai, Liu Qingyang, Zhang Shenfu, and others climb to the top of Notre Dame to sing &quot;The Internationale&quot; to the accompaniment of its bell Emmanuel, and the character of Xiao resolves at that point, instead, to translate the song into Chinese.

In addition to the Mandarin version, &quot;The Internationale&quot; also has Cantonese and Taiwanese Hokkien versions, occasionally used by communists or leftists in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The word &quot;Internationale&quot; is not translated in either version. There is also a Uyghur version, a Salar version, a Tibetan version, a Hmong version, a Chakhar Mongolian version, a Yi version, and a Zhuang version translated from the Mandarin Chinese version, used for ethnic minorities in China.

===Other languages===
====Afrikaans translation====
In the first half of the twentieth century, communists, unionists and activists of all races in South Africa sang the &quot;Internationale&quot; until the Communist Party and even loosely linked associations were suppressed from 1950&quot;.&quot; Although no Afrikaans translation from the early period has been published, Afrikaans-speaking unionists worked in significant numbers in the garment industry in the 1920s and 1930s, and were introduced to international socialism by union secretary, E. S. Sachs. The Afrikaans translation that is available today, in the wake of the SACP&#x27;s return to South Africa in 1990, is a distinctly post-apartheid version (2009) by singer-sociologist Liela Groenewald. In this video, Liela Groenewald is accompanied by brown South African musician Mervin Williams; their collaboration reflects the post-apartheid acknowledgement of Afrikaans as the language of a majority of brown (and a few black) in addition to white South Africans. English-speakers have sung a version of the British translation; for information on the Zulu version, see the paragraph on Zulu below.

==== Bengali translation ====
&quot;The Internationale&quot; was first translated to Bengali by the rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Nazrul, who was greatly inspired by the tenets of Socialism and its relevance to India under British colonial occupation, authored numerous poems in Bengali highlighting socio-political issues, including gender and economic inequities, and social justice overall. Around 1927, Nazrul was approached by Muzaffar Ahmad, one of the Founders of the Communist Party of India, requesting that he translate the celebrated song into Bengali. While it maintains the essential theme of the original (via the English version), Nazrul inserted salient social issues into it within the Indian context. It was also translated by Hemanga Biswas and Mohit Banerji, that was subsequently adopted by West Bengal&#x27;s Left Front. Here is the Bengali audio version, performed by Satya Chowdhury.
Appended below are the Bengali lyrics written by Kazi Nazrul Islam:
====English translations====
The traditional British version of &quot;The Internationale&quot; is usually sung in three verses, while the American version, written by Charles Hope Kerr with five verses, is usually sung in two. The American version is sometimes sung with the phrase &quot;the internationale&quot;, &quot;the international soviet&quot;, or &quot;the international union&quot; in place of &quot;the international working class&quot;. In English renditions, &quot;Internationale&quot; is sometimes sung as rather than the French pronunciation of . In modern usage, the American version also often uses &quot;their&quot; instead of &quot;his&quot; in &quot;Let each stand in his place&quot;, and &quot;free&quot; instead of &quot;be&quot; in &quot;Shall be the Human race&quot;.

Pete Seeger asked Billy Bragg to sing &quot;The Internationale&quot; with him at the Vancouver Folk Festival in 1989. Bragg thought the traditional English lyrics were archaic and unsingable (Scottish musician Dick Gaughan and former Labour MP Tony Benn disagreed), and composed a new set of lyrics. The recording was released on his album &quot;The Internationale&quot; along with reworkings of other socialist songs.

The English translation of a selection of Pottier&#x27;s songs and speeches, &quot;Beyond the Internationale: Revolutionary Writings&quot;, includes, in addition to the traditional British version and Kerr&#x27;s American version, a 1922 version endorsed by the Socialist Labor Party, as well as Bragg&#x27;s adaptation and one by the Workers Party of Jamaica.

====Filipino translation====
There were three Filipino versions of the song. The first was composed by Juan Feleo of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930 under the title &quot;Pandaigdigang Awit ng Manggagawa&quot; (&#x27;The International Worker&#x27;s Anthem&#x27;) which was translated from the English version. The second version was a retranslation of the first two stanzas on the basis of the French original by the Communist Party of the Philippines. The third version, which introduced the third stanza, was derived from both Chinese and French versions and translated by Jose Maria Sison, the CPP&#x27;s founding chairman.

====German translations====
The best-known and still widespread German-language adaptation was created by Emil Luckhardt in 1896, in response to a commission from Wilhelm Liebknecht, member of the Socialist Party of Germany and one of the leaders of the Second International after Liebknecht heard the French original in Lille in 1894. Luckhardt translated the first, second, and sixth verses as well as the chorus from the French. Created in the context of the Second Internationale, Luckhardt&#x27;s text reflects the late 19th-century optimism of the Second International anticipating an imminent revolution.

Apart from Luckhardt&#x27;s version, there are at least seven other German text variants—each relating to specific historical situations or ideologically divergent socialist, communist and anarchist alignments. In addition to the Luckhardt version mentioned above, there is a version penned by Franz Diederich (1908), and another written by the poet Erich Mühsam in 1919, Sigmar Mehring&#x27;s version (1908) appeared after his 1915 death in a collection of songs of the Paris Commune edited in 1924 by his son Walter Mehring. In 1937, at which time German socialists and communists were scattered in exile, Erich Weinert, wrote a new version for the Thälmann Brigade fighting for the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, Weinert&#x27;s version became the standard in East Germany, where it was reprinted in a 1971 edition containing English, Russian, German and the original French, in commemoration of the centennial of the Paris Commune.

==== Korean translations ====
&quot;The Internationale&quot; is used in both Koreas, though it is more commonly used in the North. The DPRK uses &quot;The Internationale&quot; in propaganda and music, Party Congresses, and even sports events. In South Korea, &quot;The Internationale&quot; has been used by labour unions and protestors, but remains less celebrated. A different set of lyrics is used in South Korea, while the North Korean version is based on the Soviet Russian version of &quot;The Internationale&quot;. In addition, the refrain of the South Korean version is longer and does not repeat.

==== Persian translations ====
For the first time, Abolqasem Lahouti, an Iranian poet and songwriter, translated and standardized &quot;The Internationale&quot; into Persian. It was used as the official anthem of the short lived Persian Socialist Soviet Republic and one of the main anthems of the communist Tudeh Party of Iran. In addition, after he settled in the Soviet Union, he translated his work into Tajik.

==== Portuguese translations ====
Originally translated to Portuguese by Neno Vasco in 1909 from the French version, a similar version was wildly disseminated during the general strike of 1917 by anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists. A slightly modified version is used various left-wing and far-left parties in Brazil.

==== Spanish translations ====
There are several Spanish versions, with distinct variations but without any attribution to single authors. The earliest is still sung by the Spanish Communist Party but it was apparently produced around 1910, before the split between Socialist and Communist parties across Europe around 1920. This version is also supported by the ruling Communist Party in Cuba. The Mexican version, in contrast, is based on earlier versions of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, suggesting that it dates to the Mexican Revolution. The Argentine version was associated with the Argentine Socialist Party from 1958 to the junta of the generals in 1976.

In Latin America, &quot;The Internationale&quot; has also been translated into different indigenous languages, including Aymara, Guaraní, Nahuatl, and Quechua.

==== Swahili translation ====
In Kenya, &quot;The Internationale&quot; was translated into Swahili by the Communist Party Marxist - Kenya. It was declared the group&#x27;s anthem during the second national congress in November 2024. Known as &quot;Wimbo wa Kimataifa&quot;, the Internationale, was translated by the then-party chairman, Mwandawiro Mghanga and performed by the party&#x27;s band and released in a bundled album, together with other revolutionary songs and poems.

==== Vietnamese translation ====
&quot;The Internationale&quot; was first translated into Vietnamese by the founder of the Communist Party of Vietnam and the first President of modern Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, under the pseudonym &quot;Nguyễn Ái Quốc&quot;. The current lyrics in Vietnamese were translated by the 1st and 2nd General Secretaries of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Trần Phú and Lê Hồng Phong. It was subsequently adopted by the Communist Party of Vietnam.

==== Yiddish translation ====
A Yiddish translation of &quot;The Internationale&quot; first appeared in the collection &quot;Yidishe folks-lider&quot; (&#x27;Yiddish Folk Songs&#x27;) edited by Moshe Beregovski and Itzik Feffer. It was published in Kyiv, capital of what was then the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, in 1938. Judging from metaphors that the Yiddish shares with the Russian version—both have &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;spirit boling: rather than &quot;la raison tonne or&quot; &quot;reason thunders&quot; in the French—and the translators&#x27; location in the Soviet Union, it is likely that they were working from the Russian rather than the original French.

==== Zulu translation ====
A version of &quot;The Internationale&quot; in Zulu, South Africa&#x27;s most populous language, aired on South African radio in 1990, after the South African Communist Party resurfaced after forty years of exile, The translator has not been identified but the Zulu version is likely to have been in circulation at party meetings and similar events since Zulu-speakers joined the SACP in the 1920s. The translation may have been penned or authorized by Moses Kotane, who was secretary-general of the SACP from 1939 until his death in exile in 1978. Although heard often on public occasions in the 1990s, such as at the state funeral for Joe Slovo, long-time SACP leader and minister of housing in Nelson Mandela&#x27;s cabinet, in 1995, it has receded from public airing as the party has lost influence in South Africa.

The &quot;anthem&quot; in the early pages of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; has been described as a &quot;parody&quot; or a &quot;reconfiguration&quot; of &quot;The Internationale&quot;; Orwell&#x27;s text states (as a &quot;humorous introduction&quot;) that it was sung as &quot;between Clementine and La Cucaracha&quot;,

William Carlos Williams&#x27; poem &quot;Choral: The Pink Church&quot; alludes to the lyrics of &quot;The Internationale&quot; in order to symbolise Communism, the poem otherwise barely mentioning Communism directly, Williams himself claiming to be &quot;a pink [...] &quot;not&quot; a red&quot; in a letter discussing the poem.

One of Aleksandr Lebedev-Frontov&#x27;s most famous works, which hung in the headquarters of the National Bolshevik Party, is a poster of the French Fantomas aiming a pistol at the viewer, subtitled with the first line of the Russian version of &quot;The Internationale&quot;.

The Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky concluded his play &quot;Mystery-Bouffe&quot; with an &quot;Internationale of the Future&quot;, set to the tune of the Internationale, but with lyrics describing a complete, perfect classless society as an existing fact.

Even though it stood on the far-right of the political spectrum, the Greek political party Golden Dawn employed a tune similar to &quot;The Internationale&quot; as its party anthem, the Hymn of the Golden Dawn, with a more militaristic and fascistic sound in the style of a military march. Its similar melody to a communist song possibly stemmed from the admiration of some of its members, such as Greek MP Ilias Panagiotaros, for Soviet leader Josef Stalin, as a &quot;great personality&quot;.

The Internationale is mentioned by name in the They Might Be Giants song &quot;The Communists Have the Music&quot;, when John Linnell sings, &quot;I don&#x27;t need a rationale / To sing &quot;The Internationale&quot; / I only need to plug in the headphone jack / So I can listen to my backing track.&quot;

== Documentary film on the anthem ==
Peter Miller produced and directed a half-hour documentary on the anthem with interviews with a range of people including Annette Rubinstein, Vladimir Grigoryevich Zak, Marina Feleo-Gonzalez, Pete Seeger, Dorothy Ray Healey, Li Lu and Billy Bragg. The film aims to provide a cultural history of the anthem that addresses the complexities of the relationships between the collective and the individual. The film was short-listed for the Academy Award nomination for the Best Short Documentary and won the Woodstock Film Festival, Best Short Documentary award.

<text>The cuckooshrikes and allies in the family Campephagidae are small to medium-sized passerine bird species found in the subtropical and tropical Africa, Asia and Australasia. The 93 species are divided into 11 genera. The woodshrikes (&quot;Tephrodornis&quot;) were often considered to be in this family but are now placed in their own family, Vangidae, along with the philentomas and the flycatcher-shrikes. Another genus, &quot;Chlamydochaera&quot;, which has one species, the black-breasted fruithunter, was often placed in this family but has now been shown to be a thrush (Turdidae).

==Taxonomy==
Cuckooshrikes are not closely related to either the cuckoos or to the shrikes; the name probably comes from the grey colour of many of the cuckooshrikes. Some of the species also bear a superficial resemblance to cuckoos, and have a similar undulating flight. The grey colouration has led to one of their other names, the greybird. In some parts of the world they have also been known as caterpillar-birds, a name derived from their diet. Although unsuspected earlier, DNA studies have suggested they may be related to the Old World orioles (Oriolidae), although they differ strongly in some morphological characteristics (such as skull morphology and the arrangements of feathers on the wing).

A molecular phylogenetic study of the Campephegidae published in 2010 found that the speciose genus &quot;Coracina&quot; was non-monophyletic. In the resulting reorganization to create monophyletic genera five genera were resurrected. A large group of species previously assigned to &quot;Coracina&quot; was moved to &quot;Edolisoma&quot; and a group of Asian and Indian Ocean cuckooshrikes was moved to &quot;Lalage&quot;. The African cuckooshrikes were moved to &quot;Ceblepyris&quot;, and three species were placed in monotypic genera: McGregor&#x27;s cuckooshrike was moved to &quot;Malindangia&quot;, the pygmy cuckooshrike was moved to &quot;Celebesica&quot; and the blue cuckooshrike was moved to &quot;Cyanograucalus&quot;.

==Description==
Overall the cuckooshrikes are medium to small arboreal birds, generally long and slender. The smallest species is the small minivet at and , while the largest is the south Melanesian cuckooshrike at and . They are predominantly greyish with white and black, although the minivets are brightly coloured in red, yellow and black, and the blue cuckooshrike of central Africa is all-over glossy blue. The four cuckooshrikes in the genus &quot;Campephaga&quot; exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males that have glossy black plumage and bright red or yellow wattles, the females having more subdued olive-green plumage.

==Habitat==
Of the 93 species of cuckooshrike, the majority are forest birds. Some species are restricted to primary forest, like the New Caledonian cuckooshrike, others are able to use more disturbed forest. Around eleven species use much more open habitat, one Australian species, the ground cuckooshrike being found in open plains and scrubland with few trees.

==Behaviour==

The &#x27;true&#x27; cuckooshrikes are usually found singly, in pairs, and in small family groups, whereas the minivets, flycatcher-shrikes and wood-shrikes more frequently form small flocks. There is a considerable amount of variation within the family as a whole with regards to calls, some call very infrequently and some, principally the minivets, are extremely vocal.

These are mainly insectivorous, and will take large hairy caterpillars. They have also been recorded eating small vertebrates, and some fruit, seeds and other plant matter.

Information about the breeding of this family is incomplete, with many species having never been studied. In all the species studied the cuckooshrikes are territorial; in species that do not migrate these territories are maintained year-round. Cuckooshrikes are monogamous, with the pair bonds apparently lasting throughout the year. Only one instance of non-monogamous breeding has been recorded, an instance of polygyny in white-winged trillers in Australia, where one male aided two females in raising their young. Several species of cuckooshrike exhibit cooperative breeding. About four blotchy white, green or blue eggs are laid in a cup nest in a tree. Incubation is about two weeks.

==List of genera==

The family contains 109 species divided in 11 genera:

* &quot;Pericrocotus&quot; – minivets (15 species)
* &quot;Ceblepyris&quot; – cuckooshrikes (5 species)
* &quot;Coracina&quot; – cuckooshrikes (28 species)
* &quot;Campephaga&quot; – cuckooshrikes (4 species)
* &quot;Lobotos&quot; – wattled cuckooshrikes (2 species)
* &quot;Campochaera&quot; – golden cuckooshrike
* &quot;Malindangia&quot; – McGregor&#x27;s cuckooshrike
* &quot;Edolisoma&quot; – cuckooshrikes and cicadabirds (31 species)
* &quot;Celebesica&quot; – pygmy cuckooshrike
* &quot;Cyanograucalus&quot; – blue cuckooshrike
* &quot;Lalage&quot; – trillers and cuckooshrikes (20 species)

<text>Thomas Daniel &quot;Tim&quot; Conway (December 15, 1933 – May 14, 2019) was an American actor, comedian, writer, and director. Conway is perhaps best known as a regular cast member (1975–1978) on the TV comedy &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; where he portrayed his recurrent iconic characters Mister Tudball and the Oldest Man. Over his career he received numerous accolades including five Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999 and was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2002.

Conway started his career acting in &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; and &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. He then gained recognition for his role as the inept Ensign Parker in the World War II TV situation comedy &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; from 1962 to 1966. The role garnered him a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. Conway starred on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, where he was admired for his ability to depart from scripts with humorous ad libs and gestures, which frequently caused others in the skit to break character with laughter.

Conway helmed his own series twice, &quot;The Tim Conway Comedy Hour&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; (1980–1981). He also co-starred with Don Knotts in several films including &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot; (1975), its 1979 sequel, &quot;Gus&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; (1980). He played &quot;Dorf&quot; in eight films from 1987 to 1996, and voiced Barnacle Boy in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; (1999–2012). He received two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his roles in the ABC comedy series &quot;Coach&quot; in 1996 and the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; in 2008.

== Early life and education ==
Conway was born Thomas Daniel Conway on December 15, 1933, in Willoughby, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, and grew up in nearby Chagrin Falls, the son of Daniel and Sophia (née Murgoiu) Conway. Daniel was a groomer for polo ponies. His father, who emigrated to the United States in 1927, was born in Ireland to Scottish parents, and his mother was a first-generation Romanian-American.

Conway&#x27;s legal name was Thomas, though he was also referred to as Toma, the Romanian language analog, and was typically known as Tom; he changed his stage name to Tim near the beginning of his acting career (quipping he &quot;dotted the O&quot;) to avoid confusion with British actor Tom Conway.

Conway attended Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, where he majored in television and radio and was a disc jockey, and he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. When he graduated, Conway enlisted in the United States Army, where he served between 1956 and 1958.

==Career==
===1960–1966: Rise to prominence ===
After his discharge from the Army, Conway returned to Cleveland and worked with Ernie Anderson on KYW-TV, an NBC affiliate, in 1958 and 1959. Early on, Conway and Anderson acted in TV commercials that built on their quirky brand of humor to supplement their income.

From 1960 to 1962, Conway was on WJW-TV (then a CBS affiliate, now a Fox affiliate) on a weekday morning film show (under the &quot;Ernie&#x27;s Place&quot; banner), where he also wrote material for the comedic skits shown during film intermissions. Conway also recorded a comedy album with Anderson, who gained national prominence as a voice-over announcer for ABC Television beginning in the 1970s.

WJW-TV dismissed Conway in 1962, in part because he (and Anderson) misled station management into thinking he had experience as a director. Because of this move, which deprived Anderson of his co-host and comic foil, the station asked Anderson if he could host a B-grade (and lower) horror film show on Friday nights instead. Conway continued to make many appearances alongside Anderson&#x27;s alter ego &quot;Ghoulardi&quot;, in addition to &quot;Big Chuck&quot; Schodowski, a station engineer who Anderson got to assume much of Conway&#x27;s sidekick status (and who ultimately succeeded Anderson as co-host of the horror film program).

After he became famous, Conway resurfaced periodically on Cleveland television on the &quot;Hoolihan and Big Chuck&quot; and &quot;Big Chuck and Lil&#x27; John&quot; shows on WJW-TV, in guest spots and occasional skits. Conway also made regular guest appearances at numerous &quot;Ghoulardifest&quot; functions held by WJW over the years, along with former Cleveland TV personality Bob &quot;Hoolihan&quot; Wells, in tribute to Anderson, who died in 1997.

Comedic actress Rose Marie visited WJW in 1961, as part of CBS&#x27;s promotional practice of sending their major show stars directly to local affiliates: in this case, it was for &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. She viewed tapes of some of Anderson and Conway&#x27;s skits and proceeded to take Conway under her wing. Following his departure from WJW, Conway moved to New York City; where, with Rose Marie&#x27;s assistance, he auditioned for, and gained a spot on, ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; as a regular player. During this time he also appeared on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; and &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, and &quot;Thats Life&quot;.

 &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; 
Conway gained a national following from his role as the bumbling, naive Ensign Charles Parker, Executive Officer of the World War II PT-73, in the 1960s sitcom &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, alongside Ernest Borgnine and Joe Flynn. Borgnine became a mentor and a good friend. Conway appeared at Borgnine&#x27;s 90th birthday celebration and, four years later, paid tribute to his friend at the 7th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on TNT.

Afterwards, he starred in a string of short-lived television series, starting with 1967&#x27;s &quot;Rango&quot; which starred Conway as an incompetent Texas Ranger. Conway was part of an infamous network TV programming catastrophe, &quot;Turn-On&quot;, a counter-cultural sketch comedy show on ABC that was derided as a rip-off of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. The show was in fact created and directed by &quot;Laugh-In&quot;″s creator George Schlatter. Even though Conway was listed only as a guest star on the pilot, which ABC broadcast on February 5, 1969, it was the only episode that ever aired.
In 1963, Conway guest-starred in &quot;Channing&quot; playing a job applicant. In 1968, he made two guest appearances on &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;. From 1970 to 1971, Conway made four appearances on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

&quot;Turn-On&quot; received enough immediate, negative reaction to force several ABC affiliates, including WEWS-TV in Conway&#x27;s hometown of Cleveland, to refuse to return to the program after the first commercial break. WEWS management also sent an angrily-worded telegram to the network&#x27;s headquarters. Many West Coast affiliates received advance warning and refused to air the show. Conway remarked that the show&#x27;s premiere party he attended was also the program&#x27;s cancellation party, but ABC did not officially cancel the program until February 9.

=== 1967–1978: &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; ===
Starting with the 1975–76 season, Conway became a regular on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (replacing Lyle Waggoner), after having been a frequent guest for the show&#x27;s first eight seasons. Conway&#x27;s work on the show earned him four Emmy Awards — one for writing and three for performance, one of which was before he became a regular. Two of Conway&#x27;s memorable characters on the Burnett Show were The Oldest Man, whose shaggy white hair, slow speech, and shuffling gait ran counter to the much-needed energy levels of the various occupations in which he was usually found, and Mr. Tudball, a businessman whose intentions of running a &quot;ship-shape&quot; office were usually sunk by the bored indifference of his secretary, Mrs. Wiggins (Burnett). Although the character was widely thought to be Swedish, Conway used a Romanian accent learned from his mother.

Conway would often make his co-stars on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; break character and laugh in the middle of a scene, usually without speaking a line of dialogue. According to Burnett, the characters breaking and laughing did not happen as often as many people would later remember, but because the laughter was real and added even more comedic value to a scene, those breaks would become a defining characteristic of the show.
A prime example of his ability to make his co-stars laugh uncontrollably involved Lyle Waggoner as a captured American airman, with Conway as a stereotypical blond-haired Gestapo agent charged with his interrogation. Stating that &quot;the Fuhrer&quot; had taken particular interest, Conway produced a small Hitler hand puppet. Conway suggested to the puppet that singing might relax Waggoner&#x27;s character to the point he is willing to talk. In a long, drawn-out fashion, the Hitler puppet (Conway providing a falsetto voice, with German accent) sings &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad,&quot; and with each passing verse, Waggoner loses more of his composure, finally laughing hysterically when puppet-Hitler screeches, &quot;FEE-FI-Fiddely-I-O!&quot;.

Another example of his ability to make his co-stars break up in laughter is exemplified in the &quot;Elephant Story&quot; outtake from one of the &quot;Family&quot; sketches. Conway tells an increasingly absurd story about his visit to the circus; as he continues, the other cast members (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and Dick van Dyke) are soon having trouble staying in character, looking away from him and the cameras. Conway eventually finishes his story, and Lawrence (in character as Mama) quips: &quot;Are you sure that little asshole is through?&quot;, causing the others - even Conway - to break out in hysterical laughter. Conway remained a regular cast member of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; until the program&#x27;s run ended in 1978.

=== 1970–1989: Established work ===
 &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; (1970) 
In 1970, &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; paired Conway with Joe Flynn of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; in a sitcom as owner-pilots of a one-plane (a Beechcraft Model 18 named &quot;Lucky Linda&quot;) airline operated by the duo. Having &quot;nowhere to run&quot;, this pressurized situation was ideal for the fast repartee of the lead actors. It debuted in January 1970 and the last new show aired in June 1970. In the fall of the same year, Conway was given his own hour-long variety show, &quot;The Tim Conway Comedy Hour&quot;, or &quot;The Tim Conway Comedy House&quot;, which, as his other series had, folded quickly, lasting only 13 weeks. Typical of his self-effacing humor, he ordered his car&#x27;s license plate to reflect the short duration of the series: &quot;13 WKS&quot;. (Conway was given another one-hour variety show ten years later, which revived the title &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot;.)

In 1973, Conway guest-starred in &quot;The New Scooby Doo Movies&quot;, voiced himself in the episode &quot;The Spirited Spooked Sports Show&quot;. In 1974, he was in the &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot; as a janitor in the episode: &quot;The Crazy Comedy Concert&quot;. In 1987, Conway guest-starred in &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot; as a mayoral candidate in the episode: &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;. Beginning in 1975, Conway was often paired with Don Knotts in family films from Disney, including &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot; and its 1979 sequel, &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.&quot; They also starred in two independent films, a boxing comedy called &quot;The Prize Fighter&quot; in 1979, and a 1980 mystery comedy film called &quot;The Private Eyes&quot;.

 &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; (1980–1981)

In 1980, Conway again was given his own one-hour variety program, titled &quot;The Tim Conway Show&quot; (the title that was previously used for his 1970 sitcom). It aired on CBS, as his previous shows had, and debuted on March 22, 1980. It was originally a full hour but was reduced to half an hour in summer 1980. It lasted longer than any of his earlier self-titled series, ending in August 1981. The format was similar to that of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, with several regular cast members performing in comedy sketches, interspersed with the occasional musical performance by a guest musician. Among the regulars in the cast were Maggie Roswell, Miriam Flynn, Eric Boardman, Jack Riley, and Dick Orkin. Former &quot;Burnett&quot; cast member Harvey Korman also became a &quot;Tim Conway Show&quot; regular in late 1980, after having earlier made guest appearances on the show, as had Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence.

In the spring of 1983, Conway starred in another situation comedy, &quot;Ace Crawford, Private Eye&quot;; a spoof of detective shows, it lasted only a month. In the summer of 1990, he starred in &quot;Tim Conway&#x27;s Funny America&quot;, playing pranks in disguise on unsuspecting passersby around the United States while hidden cameras recorded the results, which Conway presented to a studio audience; it, too, lasted only a few weeks.

 &quot;Dorf&quot; 

In the 1980s, Conway began appearing in a series of satirical how-to videos in which he played a diminutive, dark-haired Scandinavian known as Dorf (a variation on &quot;dwarf&quot;), reprising his goofy Mr. Tudball accent. The Dorf character first appeared on the January 3, 1986, episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. In that episode, he portrayed a horse jockey. Dorf also appeared in the 1987 film &quot;Dorf on Golf&quot; and later appeared in eight other films on a variety of sports from baseball to auto racing. &quot;Dorf on Golf&quot; was remastered for DVD in 2007. In 2010, all of the &quot;Dorf&quot; films were remastered in a DVD Collection featuring all eight films, a behind-the-scenes with Dorf, and a commentary track by Tim Conway on &quot;The Legend of the Paddle: The Oldie Hollis Story.&quot; Dorf also appeared on an episode of &quot;Tim Conway″s Funny America&quot; in the summer of 1990, leading an aerobics class on his impossibly short legs. In 2009, Conway&#x27;s Dorf character started &quot;helping&quot; Santa Claus on the website iSpotSanta. Each year, Dorf had three sketches; in 2009, he tried to give Santa his Christmas list, failing and accidentally hitting Santa with a golf ball. Then, in 2010, he tried to give all of the world&#x27;s letters to Santa directly using jet rockets to fly to his sleigh, cannonballs, and more.

Conway starred in Disney films such as &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot; (1973), &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot; (1975), &quot;Gus&quot; (1976), and &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again&quot; (1979), his work with the company earning him a Disney Legend award in 2004. He starred in the 1977 comedy film &quot;The Billion Dollar Hobo&quot;. Conway also co-starred with Don Knotts in &quot;The Prize Fighter&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; (1980). He starred in the 1986 equestrian comedy, &quot;The Longshot&quot;. Conway also appeared with Dick Martin in &quot;Air Bud: Golden Receiver&quot; (1998) as Fred Davis, the main announcer for the Timberwolves&#x27; final game, with Martin as his co-announcer, Phil Phil. He was postal employee Herman Dooly in the 1996 film, &quot;Dear God&quot;.

=== 1990–2012: Voice work and resurgence ===
In 1990, he guest-starred in &quot;Newhart&quot; as himself in the episode: &quot;Dick and Tim&quot;. In 1991, Conway made a cameo appearance in &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot; as an audience member in the episode &quot;That Little Extra Something&quot;. From 1995 to 1996, he guest-starred in &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as Ephraim Wanker, the hillbilly father of Peg Bundy in four episodes. In 1996 and 1997, Conway guest-starred in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Coach&quot;, for which he received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, playing Kenny Montague in the 1996 episode &quot;The Gardener.&quot; In 1997, Conway guest-starred in &quot;&quot; as Tim Conrad in the episode: &quot;&quot; where he teamed back up with Dick Van Dyke and Harvey Korman where Conway and Korman (Harvey Huckaby) are former comedy partners. In the episode, a clip of the well-known dentist sketch from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; was used to illustrate their partnership. In 1998, Conway guest-starred in &quot;Ellen&quot; as a comedian in the episode: &quot;Ellen: A Hollywood Tribute, Part 1&quot;.

In 1999, Conway and his good friend Ernest Borgnine reunited to become the first guest stars of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, voicing the roles of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. Series creator Stephen Hillenburg and creative director Derek Drymon visioned the voices of the characters with the two actors in mind from the very beginning, having been fans of their work in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;. Hillenberg and Drymon directly approached Borgnine and Conway, and the actors both accepted. Conway lent his voice to other television shows including &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the Disney spin-off &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Lloyd in Space&quot;, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, &quot;Cybill&quot;, &quot;The Proud Family&quot;, &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;WordGirl&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo! Pirates Ahoy!&quot;, &quot;Caillou&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s with Andy?&quot;. He also narrated &quot;The Secret Shortcut&quot; in &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; and hosted &quot;The Flintstones&#x27; 25th Anniversary Celebration&quot;. He also provided the voice of Freddy the Frog in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Garfield&#x27;s Fun Fest&quot;. From 2003 to 2010, Conway starred as Hermie in Max Lucado&#x27;s animated video series, &quot;Hermie and Friends&quot; alongside his co-star, Don Knotts as Wormie. His final voice acting role was one of the talking seagulls in &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;. In 1999, he guest-starred again in &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot; as Tim Conrad in the episode: &quot;&quot;. From 2001 to 2005, Conway guest-starred in &quot;Yes Dear&quot; as Tom Warner, the father of Greg, with &quot;Carol Burnett Show&quot; co-star Vicki Lawrence playing his wife.

Conway and Harvey Korman created a Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD of new comedy sketches, titled &quot;Together Again&quot;; it was produced by Pasquale Murena and sold through Conway&#x27;s official website. Starting in 2003, Conway teamed up with good friend Don Knotts again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children&#x27;s series &quot;Hermie and Friends&quot;, which continued with both until Knotts died in 2006. Conway continued to do the series afterwards. In 2007, he hosted &quot;Thou Shalt Laugh 2: The Deuce&quot;, a collection of Christian stand-up comedians. In 2012–13, he voiced the character Mulch in DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;DreamWorks Dragons&quot; subtitled Riders of Berk series. In 2016, he played Professor VanVanguard, a knowledgeable character of the lives, characteristics and treating of zombies in the award-winning feature film &quot;Chip &amp; Bernie&#x27;s Zomance&quot;.

On his 75th birthday in 2008, Conway was interviewed as a guest on &quot;The Bonnie Hunt Show&quot; and given a surprise cake by Bob Newhart. He won another Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Bucky Bright in the &quot;30 Rock&quot; episode &quot;Subway Hero,&quot; which initially aired on April 17, 2008. From 2010 to 2014, Conway guest-starred on &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, &quot;WordGirl&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, &quot;Mike &amp; Molly&quot;, &quot;Major Crimes&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, and &quot;Glee&quot;. In 2018, Conway was seen promoting &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and other classic television series on the MeTV television network.

==Collaborators==
Conway collaborated with many notable performers and maintained long-term professional relationships with many of them.

===Ernie Anderson===
Conway first pitched the idea of Ernie Anderson and himself doing a late night show together in Cleveland during the 1960s. That is where Rose Marie found Conway and got him a role on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. Before that, the duo recorded two comedy albums together: &quot;Are We On?&quot; (1966) and &quot;Bull&quot; (1967). Anderson turned to doing voiceovers after Conway moved on, but their collaborations continued with Conway&#x27;s string of shows and Anderson&#x27;s career as &quot;The Voice of ABC&quot;. Anderson performed on sketches and was the voiceover talent for &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.

Anderson become a cult icon in Cleveland as the character Ghoulardi during his own late night television show, where he showed horror B movies to viewers. In 2013, Conway went to the Ghoulardi Fest to promote his book and show his love for his friend Anderson.

===Harvey Korman===
Conway first met Harvey Korman in 1966 during the first of Conway&#x27;s three appearances on &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;. Korman was a four-year series regular on Kaye&#x27;s CBS variety hour. 1967 saw the end of the Kaye show and the debut of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. With Korman available, he stepped into a regular role there. Conway appeared as a guest during that first Burnett season and the two men immediately became friends starting a lifetime of working together until Korman&#x27;s death in 2008. One of their most famous sketches was from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; called &quot;The Dentist Sketch.&quot; In this sketch, Korman goes to the just-graduated dentist Conway for a toothache. Conway proceeds to remove Korman&#x27;s tooth, but before he can inject the novocaine into Korman, he injects it into himself, causing his hand, leg, and head to go numb.

Korman and Conway performed together for 10 years on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; before Korman left to pursue his own show. Korman joined Conway on Conway&#x27;s shows and then later on in the 1986 film &quot;The Longshot&quot;, which Conway wrote for the two men. Conway also wrote the direct-to-video films &quot;Tim and Harvey in The Great Outdoors&quot; and &quot;Together Again with Tim and Harvey&quot;, which the comedy pair starred in together. The duo also toured the U.S. performing together. The DVD &quot;Together Again with Tim and Harvey&quot; is a recording of their touring stage show that ran over 10 years to sold out markets until Korman&#x27;s death in 2008. When interviewed in 2004, Conway said of Korman, &quot;We&#x27;re friends; He&#x27;s a bright guy; he can do The New York Times crossword puzzle in about five minutes, but he can&#x27;t tie his shoes.&quot;

===Don Knotts===
When Conway was starting his career in Hollywood, so was Don Knotts. Both men were regulars on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, though at different times. They didn&#x27;t have the chance to work together until Disney Studios paired the two men on the Apple Dumpling Gang series of films, and their comedy clicked; Knotts&#x27;s boisterous, Barney Fife-style bungling both contrasted and meshed with Conway&#x27;s quieter form of physical comedy. The first film starred Bill Bixby and Susan Clark in 1975 and was called &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot;. In it, Bixby is tricked into taking care of a trio of orphans as a pair of lovable holdup men named Amos Tucker (Conway) and Theodore Ogelvie (Knotts) attempts to steal a gold nugget the children find. The film was a commercial success and a sequel, starring the pair, was made in 1979, called &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again&quot;. The sequel did not have the other cast members but was hugely profitable for Disney.

Conway wrote two other films for the pair to star in together starting with &quot;The Prize Fighter&quot; in 1979 and &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; in 1980. Both were independently produced and the highest grossing independent films of those years. They had a cameo in the &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; film together and in later years voiced the characters of Hermie and Wormie the caterpillars in numerous shows from Max Lucado&#x27;s Christian children&#x27;s series, &quot;Hermie and Friends&quot;.

===Pasquale Murena===
In 2007, Conway met filmmaker Pasquale Murena when Murena was brought in to direct additional scenes and edit the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Legend of the Paddle&quot;, starring Conway. The two men subsequently worked together on numerous productions, including Murena producing the DVD releases of &quot;Together Again with Tim and Harvey&quot;, the re-releases of &quot;Tim and Harvey in The Great Outdoors&quot;, &quot;Dorf on Golf&quot;, and &quot;Dorf Goes Fishing&quot;. Murena directed, produced and co-wrote with Conway six &quot;Dorf&quot; comedy sketches for the DVD release of &quot;The Ultimate Dorf DVD Collection&quot;, which has sold over 3 million copies.

Starting in 2009, the two men collaborated on their first sketches for the website iSpotSanta, where Dorf helps Santa deliver presents, and works at the North Pole as Santa&#x27;s #1 elf. The two men did over 25 comedy sketches and three short films for the website, while garnering over 35 million viewers. Conway was quoted in an interview on the Disney Channel, stating that, &quot;Pasquale has done more with Dorf than I ever imagined. We love making these films for kids.&quot; Continuing their success, Murena cast Conway as Professor VanVanGuard in his award-winning first feature film in 2014 called, &quot;Chip &amp; Bernie&#x27;s Zomance&quot;, with Conway adding his unique humor to this zombie film.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Conway was married to Mary Anne Dalton from 1961 until 1978, and they had six children together. He was married to Charlene Fusco from May 18, 1984, until his death. Her daughter, Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; Beatty, became Tim&#x27;s stepdaughter, giving him seven children altogether.

===Autobiography===
Conway&#x27;s memoir &quot;What&#x27;s So Funny?: My Hilarious Life&quot; was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list its first week on sale.

===Religion===
Tony Rossi interviewed Conway on November 20, 2013, on his podcast &quot;Christopher Closeup&quot; (on &quot;Patheos&quot;), and Conway revealed that he had converted to Catholicism. This was also reported in an interview with Raymond Arroyo on his EWTN program &quot;The World Over&quot;.

===Philanthropy===

In June 2010, Conway returned to his hometown of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, to put on fund-raising performances at the Chagrin Valley Little Theatre to kick off its capital campaign.

He was a spokesperson for the United Leukodystrophy Foundation.

===Interests===
A fan of thoroughbred horse racing and an occasional racehorse owner, Conway was the co-founder and vice-president of the board of directors of the Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund.

==Illness and death==
In September 2018, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; executive producer Vincent Waller commented that during the time Conway was recording dialogue for the seagull in &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; (which was released in 2015), he was having trouble recording due to health issues. These issues led to his complete retirement from acting in 2016; he had previously retired from playing Barnacle Boy in 2012, following his and Mermaid Man&#x27;s retirement due to Ernest Borgnine&#x27;s death.

In 2018, Conway was diagnosed with dementia due to normal pressure hydrocephalus. He had surgery to have a ventricular shunt placed. His daughter Kelly and his wife Char both wanted sole conservatorship over his health, and a suit was filed at the Superior Court of Los Angeles. Kelly wanted him to be in his home, not in a facility, for privacy reasons. Judge Robert Wada ruled against Kelly, and in March 2019 his wife was appointed as his conservator.

Conway died on May 14, 2019, at the age of 85 from complications of normal pressure hydrocephalus at a care facility in Los Angeles.

===Tributes===
Numerous actors and celebrities paid tribute to Conway following his death, including Dick Van Dyke, Patton Oswalt, Ben Stiller, Billy Gardell, Ed Asner, Buzz Aldrin, Neil Patrick Harris, Tom Kenny, Jamie Lee Curtis, Larry King, Judd Apatow, Wayne Brady, Marlee Matlin, Al Jean, John Scalzi, Richard Lewis, Marsha Warfield, Patricia Heaton, Tony Hale, Larry Wilmore, Vicki Lawrence, Yvette Nicole Brown, Andy Richter, and Conan O&#x27;Brien.

<doc id="269651" wikidata="Q1578972" url="?curid=269651" title="Albuquerque International Sunport">
<text>Albuquerque International Sunport , locally known as the Sunport, is the primary international airport serving the U.S. state of New Mexico, particularly the Albuquerque metropolitan area and the larger Albuquerque–Santa Fe–Los Alamos combined statistical area. It handles around 5.4 million passengers annually and over 400 flights daily. ABQ is located in Bernalillo County, between the Rio Grande and the Sandia Mountains, east of Old Town and Barelas, 3 miles (5 km) southeast of downtown, south of the University of New Mexico and directly to the west of Sandia National Laboratories and Kirtland Air Force Base.

ABQ is a focus airport for Southwest Airlines, which accounts for over half of all passengers, and is served by several other major airlines, including Advanced Air, Alaska, American, Delta, JetBlue, Spirit, Sun Country and United; cargo airlines serving the Sunport are FedEx Express, UPS Airlines, Empire Airlines (FedEx Feeder carrier), Ameriflight, Amazon Prime Air (operated by Sun Country), and South Aero. ABQ is the center of the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZAB), which is responsible for the airspace over most of Arizona and New Mexico, as well as parts of Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas.

ABQ has a wide range of restaurants and shops, including national brands such as Hudson News and Book Sellers and Panda Express. It also features regional gift shops and local eateries such as Black Mesa Coffee, Rio Grande Brew Pub &amp; Grill, and New Mexican cuisine restaurants like Tia Juanita&#x27;s and Comida Buena.

The Sunport is unique for its low-lying structure and Pueblo Revival architecture, which references Albuquerque&#x27;s Tiwa and Hispano heritage and New Mexico&#x27;s Pueblo and Nuevo México roots. In a 2023 J.D. Power study, it ranked fifth among medium-sized airports in the U.S. based on customer satisfaction surveys.

==History==

Albuquerque was first served by two private airports. The Albuquerque Airport, later known as Oxnard Field, opened in 1928, and the West Mesa Airport, later known as the TWA airport, opened in 1929. The first airlines to serve the airports were Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT), Western Air Express (WAE), and Mid Continent Air Express, all inaugurating service in 1929. At first the airlines operated from the Albuquerque Airport but within the first year had moved to the West Mesa Airport where they stayed for most of the 1930s decade. TAT and WAE merged in 1930 to form Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA). Mid Continent Air Express&#x27; service was replaced by Varney Speed Lines in 1934. Three years later Varney changed its name to Continental Airlines.

In 1935, it was suggested that the city build a new public airport using Works Progress Administration money. Having secured US$520,500 in funding, Governor Clyde Tingley broke ground for the project on February 28, 1937. Albuquerque Municipal Airport opened in 1939 with two paved runways, a Pueblo Style terminal building designed by Ernest Blumenthal, and a large hangar designed to accommodate the new Boeing 307 Stratoliner operated by TWA. TWA became Trans World Airlines in 1946. Within two years after the airport opened, the Albuquerque Army Air Base was constructed to the east. This facility later became Kirtland Air Force Base and still shares the runways and other facilities with the commercial operations of the airport today. Monarch Airlines came to Albuquerque in 1947 then merged with other carriers to become Frontier Airlines in 1950. Pioneer Air Lines began service in 1948 and merged into Continental Airlines in 1955. TWA, the largest of the carriers serving Albuquerque, introduced the first jet service in 1961 using the Boeing 707. The airport was renamed Albuquerque Sunport on April 17, 1963. In late 1963, Trans Texas Airways (later becoming Texas International Airlines) began service, rounding out the first four carriers to serve the airport prior to the airline deregulation act of 1978. Several smaller commuter airlines also served the airport over the years including Ross Aviation.

The present terminal was designed by William E. Burk Jr. It is built just east of the original terminal and opened on November 12, 1965. At first the terminal had eight gates, four at the main building and another four at a small satellite building to the south connected by a tunnel. None of the gates had jetbridges. The airport gained international status in 1971 and was renamed the Albuquerque International Airport on September 17, 1971.

The terminal has been expanded several times, first in 1973 when a west wing was added with a large gate and jetbridge able to handle new wide-body aircraft. TWA used this gate to introduce the Lockheed L-1011 to Albuquerque in 1974 with flights to Chicago. After airline deregulation was passed in 1978, a flood of new airlines came to ABQ. The west wing was expanded in 1980 with three more gates, all of which had jetbridges and were used extensively by TWA and several new carriers. Southwest Airlines, which started service on April 3, 1980, quickly grew to become the largest carrier serving the airport. Southwest used the old gates 1 and 2 at the main terminal and installed three ground level jetbridges at these two gates.

During 1987 through 1989, the terminal was greatly expanded and renovated advertising a design by Phillip Jacobson and BPLW Associates. A second level was added to the front of the building for separate arrival and departure levels, and the satellite gate building was replaced with two concourses, A and B, giving the Sunport 19 new gates, all with jetbridges. In 1994, the airport&#x27;s name was changed to the current designation of the Albuquerque International Sunport. Concourse A was further expanded with four additional gates in 1996 and the above-ground connector link to the concourses was expanded in 2005 to accommodate the need for additional security screening by the TSA after the September 11 attacks in 2001. The three gates added to the west wing in 1980 were no longer used and were removed in 2007. From 2017 through 2020, the terminal received an extensive modernization and facelift.

Several fixed-base operators handling general aviation have operated at the Sunport over the years, the largest being Cutter Aviation, which traces its roots back to the original Albuquerque Airport in 1928. Cutter relocated to the current Sunport grounds in 1947 operating from a large hangar on the southwest corner of the terminal ramp. An all-new general aviation facility was constructed on the south side of the main east–west runway during the mid-1980s and the Cutter hangar was torn down for the terminal expansion of 1987–1989. A new United States Post Office facility and a new freight facility and air cargo ramp were opened in the 1990s. In 2001, a new off-site rental car facility was opened, and all rental car operations were moved out of the main terminal.

The old terminal of 1939 has been restored and houses offices of the Transportation Security Administration. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

===Historical airline service===

The Sunport is served by Alaska, American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and United Airlines, as well as one commuter airline, Advanced Air. Total weekday departures averaged 83 flights per day in the fall of 2023; however, the Sunport peaked with 163 flights per day in December 1995 and again in August 2001. Many extra flights are added during the week of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta in early October of each year. In the past, Albuquerque has been served by the following commercial airlines:
TWA (1929-2001), Continental (1934-2012), Pioneer (1948-1955), Monarch (1947-1950), Frontier Airlines (1950-1986|Frontier (1950–1986), Trans Texas/Texas International (1963-1982), Eastern (1979-1988), Western (1981-1987), PSA (1983-1988), America West (1983-2007), Wien Air Alaska (1984), USAir (1988-1997), Braniff (1988-1989), Pan Am (1989-1990), Northwest (1992-2010), Frontier (1994-2014 and 2017-2022), Reno Air (1995-1998), Western Pacific/Mountain Air Express (1997), AeroMexico Connect (1993-1994 and 2009-2010), Great Plains (2001-2004), US Airways (formerly USAir) (2007-2015), ExpressJet (2007-2008), Allegiant (2016-2022), and Volaris (2018-2019).

TWA was first: passenger flights began in 1929, with Albuquerque being one of many stops on a transcontinental route between Los Angeles and New York. TWA had the first jets to serve ABQ, the Boeing 707, and Convair 880 in 1961. In 1974 TWA brought the first wide-body jet to ABQ, the Lockheed 1011. Service peaked in 1979 with 21 daily departures to 13 cities including nonstops to Los Angeles and New York. After airline deregulation in the early 1980s, TWA downsized its operation and in 1985 only had flights to its hub at St. Louis. Service continued until December 2, 2001, when the carrier merged with American Airlines.

Continental Airlines was second at Albuquerque, since 1934 as a stop on its north–south route between Denver and El Paso. In 1940 Continental added flights to several smaller cities in Southeastern New Mexico but that was transferred to Frontier and Trans Texas Airways in 1963. In the latter half of the 1960s Continental expanded with Boeing 720, Boeing 727, and Douglas DC-9 jets nonstop to Chicago, Dallas, Denver, El Paso, Lubbock, Midland/Odessa, San Antonio, and San Francisco. Service peaked in summer 1977 with 24 daily departures. Continental downsized its operation after airline deregulation and by 1994 was only flying to its Houston hub (a nonstop flight to Newark was added for a period in the mid-2000s). Continental merged with United Airlines in 2012.

Frontier Airlines began service to Albuquerque in 1947 as Monarch Airlines, flying to Salt Lake City with stops at many smaller cities in the four corners states. Service was expanded in the 1960s with Boeing 727 and Boeing 737 jets to Denver, El Paso, Phoenix, Tucson, Dallas, and Las Vegas and in 1973 Frontier operated 19 daily flights at ABQ. Frontier began the first international flights to several resort cities in Mexico in the early 1980s but the carrier closed down in 1986. A new Frontier Airlines came to ABQ in 1994 with flights to Denver and El Paso. The carrier discontinued service in 2014 but returned in October 2017 with flights once again to Denver. Service to Austin, Orlando and San Antonio were added in 2018 but discontinued in 2019. Service was changed from Denver to Las Vegas, NV in 2022 but Frontier ended all service to Albuquerque by the end of 2022.

Pioneer Air Lines served Albuquerque between 1948 and 1955 with two flights per day to Dallas, Texas making eight stops en route. Pioneer merged into Continental Airlines in 1955 and by 1959 Continental was flying the route nonstop. The Albuquerque to Dallas route would be a major stronghold for Continental for the next 20 years.

In 1963 Trans-Texas Airways came to Albuquerque, taking over service to the smaller cities in New Mexico that Continental had served. It later expanded with nonstop Douglas DC-9s to Dallas and Los Angeles. TTA became Texas International Airlines in 1969 and flew DC-9&#x27;s from ABQ to Santa Fe and Roswell, New Mexico. The carrier peaked in 1975 with 15 daily departures and merged with Continental Airlines in 1982.

Southwest Airlines began service to the Sunport in 1980 and expanded quickly creating a hub at ABQ. The carrier took over the number one spot by the early 1980s and peaked with 66 daily departures in October 2001. Although Southwest has cut back since then, it has served 29 cities nonstop from ABQ. The decline in service is attributed to the repeal of the Wright Amendment which only allowed air travel to Texas and airports in bordering states from Dallas Love Field.

American Airlines began serving the Sunport in 1979, Delta Airlines in 1982, United Airlines in 1983, jetBlue in 2013, Alaska Airlines in 2014, and Spirit Wings in 2022.

At least 35 commuter and regional airlines have served Albuquerque, the largest of these by far was Mesa Airlines which served the Sunport from 1980 through 2007. Mesa peaked with 46 daily departures in 1990 and served 18 cities in New Mexico and Colorado nonstop from their hub in ABQ. Mesa still serves ABQ but now as a regional airline providing feeder service for American Eagle and United Express on regional jets. Other larger commuter airlines that served the Sunport for many years include Air Midwest and Great Lakes Airlines.

Regional airlines serving the Sunport on behalf of the majors are: CommutAir, Envoy, Horizon, Mesa, Republic, and SkyWest. Sun Country Airlines, iAero, and Denver Air Connection, also serve ABQ with regular charter flights.

In November 2018, low-cost Mexican carrier Volaris began serving Albuquerque from Guadalajara, Mexico, and later from Chihuahua, Mexico — a route previously operated by Aeroméxico Connect in 2009. Volaris stopped serving Albuquerque in June 2019 due to very low passenger loads and a disagreement over government subsidies to its flights. At that time, these were the only two international destinations offered by any airline flying to Albuquerque.

===Military facilities and operations===
The Sunport began a new role in 1940 when it was designated Albuquerque Army Air Base, the precursor to today&#x27;s Kirtland Air Force Base. The Sunport continues to share its runways with Kirtland AFB, which also handles rescue and firefighting operations. An Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) installation, the host unit is the 377th Air Base Wing (377 ABW). Flying units at Kirtland AFB consist of the 58th Special Operations Wing (58 SOW) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and the 150th Special Operations Wing (150 SOW), an Air Education and Training Command (AETC)-gained unit of the New Mexico Air National Guard.

===Future developments===
The Airport Master Plan drafted in 2002 lays out intermediate- and long-term projects at the Sunport, including the construction of a second terminal when traffic demands it. The runway 17/35 closure and removal recommendation was based on safety, noise abatement, and the cost of upkeep. Because 17/35 intersected all three of the other runways, it ran the highest risk of runway incursions. The runway was closed in the summer of 2012, and the tarmac is used for taxiing aircraft and for a firefighting training aircraft located on the north end. The configuration of the other three runways, in conjunction with typical wind patterns, enabled them to handle departures and landings more efficiently.

With the closure of Runway 17/35, approximately 75 acres of land just northeast of the terminal complex became available for redevelopment. The City of Albuquerque has initiated a project called Destination Sunport to promote the area as an emerging business hub supporting collaboration among Albuquerque&#x27;s research and development community and the global marketplace. Development of the business park began on 14 December 2018, with three phases estimated to be completed over five years.

In the longer term, the plan calls for a new terminal to be built to the northeast of the existing terminal. A people mover system will connect the terminal with parking facilities and the existing terminal.

==Facilities==
The Albuquerque International Sunport covers and has three runways. In the year ending February 28, 2022, the Sunport had 134,024 aircraft operations with an average of 367 per day: 29% scheduled commercial, 20% air taxi, 36% general aviation and 15% military. , there were 205 fixed-wing aircraft and 33 helicopters based at the Sunport, 48 (20%) of which were military-affiliated. ABQ&#x27;s terminal, which was expanded in the late 1980s, and again to its present size in 1996, encompasses 574,000 sq ft (53,300 m2) of space. The Sunport has a Pueblo Revival style passenger terminal which houses two concourses and an area for commuter airline gates.

The largest passenger aircraft scheduled into Albuquerque is the Boeing 737-900ER, operated by Delta Air Lines on flights to Atlanta. American Airlines occasionally operates Airbus A321&#x27;s as equipment swaps. The largest regular passenger aircraft used to be the Boeing 757-200 and McDonnell Douglas MD-90, both operated by Delta, who flew the aircraft to and from Atlanta, Cincinnati, and Minneapolis. The largest commercial aircraft the Sunport usually sees is a FedEx or UPS Boeing 767-300, replacing the latter&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 that now only fly in on rare occasions. The largest passenger aircraft to have ever flown in is the Boeing 747-400 which was operated by Atlas Air on a military charter flight on January 27, 2021. Another large aircraft, the Boeing 777 flying for United Airlines, has been diverted to the Sunport from Denver International Airport on several occasions.

In 2013, the aerial firefighting company, 10 Tanker Air Carrier, moved its headquarters to Albuquerque and currently have four DC-10 large air tankers based out of the Albuquerque International Sunport.

The largest aircraft of any type to regularly visit ABQ is the C-5 Galaxy. In 1974, and again from 1982 through 1992, the Sunport had scheduled Trans World Airlines Lockheed L-1011s. The largest aircraft to have ever visited the Sunport is the Antonov An-124, of which some have landed at ABQ on a couple of extremely rare occasions.

==Terminal==

The Albuquerque International Sunport has one terminal with 25 gates in four concourses, including a concourse for commuter airline gates. The terminal was originally built in 1965, but expanded in 1989; this expansion has present-day concourses A and B. Concourse A has 13 gates: A1 – A12, A14. Concourse B has 9 gates: B1, B3-B10 (Gate B2 was removed during the security hall expansion in 2005). Concourse E has 2 gates: E1 &amp; E2. Concourse C, originally known as the west wing, consisted of four gates (11, 12, 14, &amp; 15). Gate 11 was closed when the terminal was expanded in 1989 and the remaining three gates were renumbered to C1, C2, &amp; C3. TWA continued to use these gates for a few more years until gates C2 and C3 showed signs of structural failure and later had to be demolished. TWA moved to concourse B and the lobby area of gate C1 (the gate built in 1973) has mostly been converted to office space. The lower level of gate C1 houses U. S. Customs and is still used for occasional international arriving flights. Concourse D was a ground-level commuter aircraft concourse that was used by Great Plains Airlines. It was closed in 2004 after Great Plains Airlines liquidated due to insolvency. The concourse is now a weight and fitness facility for city airport employees. Concourse E was renamed to Concourse C in 2019 and is used by commuter airlines Advanced Air and Boutique Air. The original Concourse C was then renamed as the International Arrivals gate.

==Incidents and accidents==

*On February 19, 1955, TWA Flight 260, a Martin 4-0-4 bound for Santa Fe, crashed into the Sandia Mountains shortly after takeoff. All 16 people on board the flight were killed.
*On September 11, 1958, a US Air Force F-102 Delta Dagger slid off the end of Runway 35 in heavy rain and struck a car on Gibson Boulevard before coming to rest in an empty lot on the north side of the street. Both occupants of the car were killed.
*On November 27, 1971, in the early morning hours, TWA Flight 106, a Boeing 727 destined for Chicago, was hijacked to Cuba. The hijackers, three men who had killed a New Mexico State Police Officer two weeks prior, were taken into custody in Havana and never returned to the United States.
*On November 3, 1973, National Airlines Flight 27, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10, suffered a catastrophic engine failure over an area near Datil, NM, while en route from Houston to Las Vegas. Shrapnel from the engine struck the fuselage and caused an explosive decompression of the aircraft. One passenger was blown out of the cabin and killed. The plane was able to make an emergency landing at ABQ with no further fatalities.
*On September 14, 1977, a USAF Boeing EC-135 crashed into the Manzano Mountains just after takeoff, killing all 20 people on board.
*On September 11, 1990, a Morane Saulnier MS.760 Paris operated by &quot;Stonewall Transport&quot;, bound for Las Cruces, New Mexico, impacted terrain after takeoff moments later during a night flight. Pilot fatigue and spatial disorientation were the probable causes. Both occupants died.
*On July 6, 1997, Delta Air Lines Flight 1470, a Boeing 727, suffered a right landing gear failure after landing on Runway 21. While there were no fatalities, 3 people were injured and the aircraft suffered serious damage.
*On June 4, 2021, a Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Nashville was forced to make an emergency landing in Albuquerque, after an unruly passenger attempted to force open the cockpit door. He was restrained by a flight attendant and several passengers, and law enforcement officers on the ground arrested the assailant.

==Amenities==
* The Sunport provides free Wi-Fi internet access. In February 2005, the Sunport was voted one of the top five U.S. airports for wireless access, and the only one that provided it for free, according to a Microsoft Small Business Center poll. As of October 2022, the service is still provided free.
* There is a free cell phone parking area, where meeters and greeters can park and wait for a call from their arriving passenger before driving to the front of the terminal for pickup.
* There are two free aircraft observation areas, including one near the aforementioned Cellphone lot that is adjacent to now-closed Runway 17/35. A larger observation area at the southwest corner of the airfield property, near the approach end of Runway 3 was accessible from Spirit Dr. SE. This area has since been closed to the public, with only the aforementioned lot adjacent to the closed 17/35 runway being the remaining aircraft observation area. These areas were created to replace a large parking area adjacent to the approach ends of Runways 8 and 12 that closed in 2007; an Eclipse Aerospace aircraft painting facility now occupies this location.

<text>François de Bassompierre (; 12 April 157912 October 1646) was a French courtier.

The son of Christophe de Bassompierre (1547–1596), he was born at the castle of Haroué in Lorraine. He was descended from an old family which had for generations served the dukes of Burgundy and Lorraine, and after being educated with his brothers in Bavaria and Italy, was introduced to the court of King Henry IV of France in 1598. He became a great favourite of the king and shared to the full in the dissipations of court life. In 1600, he took part in the brief campaign in Savoy, and in 1603 fought in Hungary against the Turks for emperor Rudolf II.

In 1614, he assisted Marie de&#x27; Medici, now queen mother, in her struggle against the nobles, but upon her failure in 1617 remained loyal to the young king Louis XIII and assisted the royalists when they routed Marie&#x27;s supporters at Les Ponts-de-Cé in 1620. His services during the Huguenot rising of 1621–22 won for him the dignity of marshal of France. He was with the army of the king during the siege of La Rochelle in 1628, and in 1629 distinguished himself in the campaign against the Huguenot rebels of Languedoc, especially at the Siege of Privas. In 1615 Bassompierre had purchased from Henri, duc de Rohan, the coveted position of colonel-general of the Swiss and Grisons; on this account he was sent to raise troops in Switzerland when Louis XIII marched against Savoy in 1629, and after a short campaign in Italy his military career ended.

As a diplomat, his career was a failure. In 1621, he went to Madrid as envoy extraordinary to arrange the dispute concerning the seizure of the Valtelline forts by Spain, and signed the fruitless Treaty of Madrid. In 1625, he was sent into Switzerland on an equally futile mission, and in 1626 to London to secure the retention of the Catholic ecclesiastics and attendants of Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I of England. The personal influence of Henry IV had deterred Bassompierre from a marriage with Charlotte de Montmorency, daughter of the constable Montmorency, afterwards princesse de Condé, and between 1614 and 1630 he was secretly married to Louise Marguerite, widow of François, prince de Conti, and through her became implicated in the plot to overthrow Richelieu on the &quot;Day of the Dupes&quot; (1630). His share was only a slight one, but his wife was an intimate friend of Marie de&#x27; Medici, and her hostility to the cardinal aroused his suspicions. By Richelieu&#x27;s orders, Bassompierre was arrested at Senlis on 25 February 1631, and put into the Bastille, where he remained until after Richelieu&#x27;s death in 1643.

On his release his offices were restored to him, and he passed most of his time at the castle of Tillières in Normandy, until his death in 1646 aged 67. He left a son, François de la Tour, by the princesse de Conti (Louise Marguerite de Lorraine), and an illegitimate son, Louis de Bassompierre, afterwards Bishop of Saintes.

His &quot;Mémoires&quot;, which are an important source for the history of his time, were first published at Cologne in 1665. He also left an incomplete account of his embassies to Spain, Switzerland and England (Cologne, 1668) and a number of discourses upon various subjects.

During his embassy to Charles I of England in 1626, Bassompierre was entertained by the Master of the Ceremonies Sir Lewes Lewkenor, who escorted him to a play, &#x27;Lucnar came to bring me a very rich present from the king, of four diamonds set in a lozenge, and a great stone at the end; and the same evening sent again to fetch me to hear an excellent English play.&#x27;

<doc id="269663" wikidata="Q119524" url="?curid=269663" title="February 1974 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The February 1974 United Kingdom general election was held on Thursday 28 February 1974. The Labour Party, led by former Prime Minister Harold Wilson, gained 14 seats (301 total) but was seventeen short of an overall majority. The Conservative Party, led by Prime Minister Edward Heath, lost 28 seats (though it polled a higher share of the vote than Labour). That resulted in a hung parliament, the first since 1929. Heath sought a coalition with the Liberals, but the two parties failed to come to an agreement and so Wilson became prime minister for a second time, his first with a minority government. Wilson called another early election in September, which was held in October and resulted in a Labour majority. The February election was also the first general election to be held with the United Kingdom as a member state of the European Communities (EC), which was widely known as the &quot;Common Market&quot;.

Its results saw Northern Ireland diverging heavily from the rest of the United Kingdom, with all twelve candidates elected being from local parties (eleven of them representing unionist parties) after the decision of the Ulster Unionists to withdraw support from the Conservative Party in protest over the Sunningdale Agreement. The Scottish National Party achieved significant success at the election by increasing its share of the popular vote in Scotland from 11% to 22%, and its number of MPs from one to seven. Plaid Cymru also succeeded for the first time in getting candidates elected at a general election in Wales (its sole previous seat was won at a by-election in 1966).

Although Heath&#x27;s incumbent Conservative government polled the most votes by a small margin, the Conservatives were overtaken in terms of seats by Wilson&#x27;s Labour Party because of a more efficiently distributed Labour vote. Ultimately, the decision by the seven Ulster Unionist MPs not to take the Conservative whip proved decisive in giving Labour a slim plurality of seats. The other four unionists elected were hardliners who were not affiliated with the UUP.

Both the Labour and the Conservative parties lost a considerable share of the popular vote, largely to the Liberal Party under Jeremy Thorpe&#x27;s leadership, which polled two-and-a-half times its share of the vote in the previous election. However, even with over 6,000,000 votes, only 14 Liberal MPs were elected. There had been some media projections that the Liberals could take twice as many seats.

Given that it was not obvious who could command the support of the House, Heath did not resign immediately as prime minister. However, he knew that even if he could persuade all eleven of Northern Ireland&#x27;s unionist MPs to support a Conservative government, at least on confidence matters, over one led by Wilson, he would still need the support of the Liberals to have a workable majority. Heath, therefore, started negotiations with Thorpe to form a coalition government. Thorpe, never enthusiastic about supporting the Conservatives, demanded major electoral reforms in exchange for such an agreement. Unwilling to accept such terms, Heath resigned, and Wilson returned for his second stint as Prime Minister.

The election night was covered live on the BBC and was presented by Alastair Burnet, David Butler, Robert McKenzie and Robin Day.

Prominent members of Parliament who retired or were defeated at the election included Gordon Campbell, Bernadette McAliskey, Enoch Powell, Richard Crossman, Tom Driberg and Patrick Gordon Walker. It was the first of two United Kingdom general elections held that year, the first to take place after the United Kingdom became a member of the European Communities on 1 January 1973, and the first since 1929 not to produce an overall majority in the House of Commons for the party with the most votes. This was also the first time since 1910 that two general elections were held in the same year.
==Background==
On 20 October 1973, a group of Arab nations led by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia imposed a total oil embargo on the United States to punish the Americans for a perceived pro-Israel bias during the October war, which led to the so-called &quot;oil shock&quot; that plunged the world into the steepest recession since the Great Depression. The United Kingdom was not subject to the embargo, but the embargo led to the price of oil quadrupling worldwide in late 1973 as the shortage of oil in the United States made American consumers willing to pay higher oil prices, which in turn led to higher worldwide oil prices including in Britain as oil producers would not ship oil to nations that would not pay the same prices relative to American consumers. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1969, but only started to be pumped in 1975, making Britain in 1973-1974 entirely dependent upon imported oil. The end of the &quot;long summer&quot; of post-war prosperity caused an immense psychological shock in the Western nations, leading the &quot;Financial Times&quot; to run a famous headline in December 1973 reading: &quot;The Future Will Be Subject to Delay&quot;.

In December 1973 Heath warned in a series of speech that because of the &quot;oil shock&quot; that the United Kingdom was headed into a recession and the British people should expect economic austerity. The need to avoid importing the now considerably more expensive oil to help manage the balance-of-payments led the Heath government to turn towards coal (which Britain was self-sufficient in) as a substitute source of energy, which gave the coal miners union immense leverage over the government to press for higher wages for the coal miners. Prior to the oil shock, the government always threaten to convert electricity plants powered by coal, a threat that no longer be credibly made. Heath offered the coal miners a 7% wage increase, which was rejected as insufficient by the miners who wanted a 35% wage increase. In late 1973-early 1974, Heath held a series of inconclusive meetings with Joe Gormley, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers. Several times, Heath threatened to call a snap election with the aim of seeking a mandate to oppose the demands of Gormley and the other union leaders, a tactic that was considered to be counterproductive by the union leaders. In a bid to save electricity, in December 1973 the Heath government passed a bill imposing a three-day work week that came into effect on 1 January 1974, which greatly contributed to the crisis atmosphere.

==Campaign==
On Thursday 7 February, it was announced that Prime Minister Edward Heath had asked Queen Elizabeth II, who was then in New Zealand for the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, to dissolve Parliament for a general election to take place on 28 February. Because of the Queen&#x27;s being abroad, the dissolution of parliament was required to be promulgated by Counsellors of State, in this case Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret, on her express instructions. The severe economic circumstances in which the election was held prompted both &quot;The Sun&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; to characterise it as a &quot;crisis election&quot;. Heath had been elected on a platform in 1970 that in some ways anticipated the policies later pursued by Margaret Thatcher as he called for less state involvement in the economy, but during his time in office he performed a series of &quot;u-turns&quot; that instead led to greater state involvement in the British economy, which had damaged his reputation. Heath by his various &quot;u-turns&quot; performed between 1970 and 1974 acquired the image of a leader who reacted to events instead of being a leader who shaped events, which contributed in part to his defeat in 1974. A number of ministers in Heath&#x27;s government, most notably William Whitelaw, were opposed to calling an election in early 1974 and would preferred to wait until later in 1974 or even 1975 out of the hope the economy might be in better shape.

On 10 February, the National Union of Mineworkers, as expected, went on strike, but it was more of a low-key affair than the high-profile clashes of 1972, with no violence and only six men on each picket line. Jim Prior later wrote that the miners had been &quot;as quiet and well-behaved as mice&quot;. The Three-Day Week continued throughout the election, although Heath allowed the late-night television curfew to be lifted to allow more coverage of the campaign. The low profile of the miners&#x27; strike allowed worries over inflation to dominate the election. On 15 February, it was announced that the Retail Price Index showed a 20% increase in prices over the previous year.

On 21 February, the Pay Board released a report on miners&#x27; pay, which unexpectedly revealed that they were paid less than other manufacturing workers, contrary to the claims of the National Coal Board. That came as a severe blow to the Conservative position, and led to accusations that the National Coal Board did not understand its own pay system and that the strike was unnecessary. Further bad news for Heath and his party came four days later, with the latest trade figures showing that the current account deficit for the previous month had been £383,000,000, the worst in recorded history. Heath claimed the figures confirmed &quot;the gravity of the situation&quot; and the need for a new mandate, which prompted Roy Jenkins to quip: &quot;He [Heath] presumably thinks a still worse result would have given him a still stronger claim&quot;.

One of the most unexpected and explosive events of the campaign was when the outspoken Conservative MP Enoch Powell, who had already announced that he could not stand for re-election on the Conservative manifesto, urged people to vote against Heath for bringing about UK membership of the European Communities. In a speech in Birmingham on 23 February 1974, Powell claimed the main issue in the campaign was whether Britain was to &quot;remain a democratic nation ... or whether it will become one province in a new Europe super-state&quot;; he said it was people&#x27;s &quot;national duty&quot; to oppose those who had deprived Parliament of &quot;its sole right to make the laws and impose the taxes of the country&quot;. The speech prompted &quot;The Sun&quot; to run the headline &quot;Enoch puts the boot in&quot;. A few days later, he said he hoped for victory by &quot;the party which is committed to a fundamental renegotiation of the Treaty of Brussels and to submitting to the British People ... the outcome of that renegotiation&quot;. Those were the explicit manifesto promises of the Labour Party.

A further unforeseen blow to the Conservative campaign came on 26 February when Campbell Adamson, Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), was reported to have called for the repeal of the Heath Government&#x27;s Industrial Relations Act and to have said that the Act had &quot;sullied every relationship between employers and unions at national level&quot;. Adamson had been closely involved with the Downing Street talks over the mining dispute. Although Heath emphasised that Adamson was voicing a personal opinion and that his views did not express the official position of the CBI, he after the election acknowledged that the intervention had a negative impact on the Conservative campaign. Labour, meanwhile, cited Adamson&#x27;s comments as proving the need &quot;for everything they (had)... been urging on the Government&quot;.

===Conservative campaign===
Heath addressed the country on television on the evening of 7 February, and asked: 

The Conservative campaign was, thus, encapsulated by the now-famous phrase &quot;Who governs Britain?&quot;

The party&#x27;s manifesto, which was largely written by the future Chancellor Nigel Lawson, was entitled &quot;Firm Action for a Fair Britain&quot; and characterised by the historian Dominic Sandbrook as &quot;strident rhetoric&quot;. It claimed the Labour opposition had been taken over by &quot;a small group of power-hungry trade union leaders&quot;, who were &quot;committed to a left-wing programme more dangerous and more extreme than ever before in its history&quot;. It went on to assert that a Labour victory would be a &quot;major national disaster&quot;. Sandbrook criticised the Conservative manifesto as &quot;very vague and woolly&quot; and lacking in &quot;detailed policies or [a] sense of direction.&quot;

Edward Heath played a dominant and crucial role in the campaign. In public, he appeared calm and in control. David Watt, in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, called him &quot;statesmanlike&quot; and &quot;relaxed&quot;. In his party&#x27;s final broadcast of the campaign he said: &quot;I&#x27;ll do all that I can for this country ... We&#x27;ve started a job together. With your will, we shall go on and finish the job&quot;.

One Conservative political broadcast attracted controversy for its ferocity. In the film the narrator warned that Labour would confiscate &quot;your bank account, your mortgage and your wage packet&quot; while pictures of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan dissolved into those of Michael Foot and Tony Benn. It went on to allege that Labour would not have to move much further to the left before &quot;you could find yourself not even owning your own home&quot;. Wilson was reportedly furious, and Lord Carrington, the Secretary of State for Energy, made a formal apology.

===Labour campaign===
The Labour manifesto, &quot;Let us work together&quot;, consisted of only ten pages only, the shortest since 1955. It had been greatly influenced by the economist Stuart Holland and Shadow Industry Secretary Tony Benn. In it, Labour promised &quot;a fundamental and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people and their families&quot;. It advocated planning agreements with industry and the creation of a National Enterprise Board. That section attracted criticism from some figures within the party. For example, Anthony Crosland privately called the programme &quot;half-baked&quot; and &quot;idiotic&quot;.The manifesto also committed the party to renegotiating the terms of Britain&#x27;s entry into the European Economic Community and to holding a national referendum on the issue.

The Labour campaign presented the party&#x27;s leadership as competent negotiators, who would restore peace with the unions. Unlike in previous elections, Wilson took something of a back seat and allowed James Callaghan, Denis Healey and Shirley Williams to play equal, if not greater, roles in the campaign. In the final broadcast of the campaign, a series of leading figures claimed Labour could put Britain &quot;on the road to recovery&quot;. In the film, Wilson asserted: &quot;Trades unionists are people. Employers are people. We can&#x27;t go on setting one against the other except at the cost of damage to the nation itself&quot;.

===Liberal campaign===
The Liberal Party had undergone a revival under the leadership of Jeremy Thorpe by winning a string of by-elections in 1972 and 1973. It had begun to appeal to disaffected Conservative voters and continued to do so throughout the campaign. Thorpe came across as young and charismatic, often attempting to appear above the two-party fray. The manifesto, &quot;You can Change the Face of Britain&quot;, promised voting reform and devolution, but Sandbrook described its economic policy as &quot;impossibly vague&quot;. The Liberals began to contest more seats, standing in 517 constituencies across the country.

===Scottish National Party campaign===
During the election, the Scottish National Party campaigned widely on the political slogan &quot;It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil&quot;. It was argued that the discovery of North Sea oil off the coast of Scotland and the revenue that it created would not benefit Scotland to any significant degree while it remained part of the United Kingdom.

=== Position of press ===
The historian Dominic Sandbrook describes the &quot;level of partisanship&quot; amongst the national newspapers during the election as &quot;unprecedented&quot; in post-war Britain, with most of the media prejudiced in favour of Heath and the Conservatives. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was one of the few national newspapers to support Labour, with many others urging their readers to re-elect Heath. In the right-wing media, there was fierce condemnation of Wilson and his party. &quot;The Sun&quot;, which had supported Labour in 1970, claimed a Labour victory would result in &quot;galloping inflation&quot;, and an editorial in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said a Labour government would be &quot;complete ruin public and private&quot; and condemned what it saw as Wilson&#x27;s &quot;craven subservience to trade union power&quot;. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; published a piece by Kingsley Amis calling the Labour politician Tony Benn, who was to be appointed Secretary of State for Industry after the election, &quot;the most dangerous man in Britain&quot;, and in the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, the cartoonist Cummings depicted the miners&#x27; leader Joe Gormley, Wilson and other Labour figures as French revolutionaries guillotining Heath. &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in contrast, chose to support no party openly. Its columnist Peter Jenkins claimed the last ten years had proved that &quot;neither party&quot; had the ability to deal with the country&#x27;s problems.

==Economic background==
It was the first general election in the United Kingdom to be held during an economic crisis since the 1931 general election, which had been held in the depths of the Great Depression.

==Opinion polls==

Throughout the campaign 25 of the 26 opinion polls had a Conservative lead and one even by 9%. Of the six polls on election day (28 February), two had a 2% lead, two a 4% lead, one a 3% lead and one a 5% lead.

==Timeline==
As the Queen was in New Zealand on 7 February, the Prime Minister notified her of his intentions via telegram, rather than by the usual protocol of visiting Buckingham Palace. The key dates were as follows:
==Results==
The election was fought on new constituency boundaries with five more seats added to the 630 used in 1970. This led to many seats changing hands on the new notional boundaries. Notional election results from the 1970 general election were calculated on behalf of the BBC by Michael Steed to of compare constituency results with those of February 1974.

For the first time since 1929, the two largest political parties had received less than a combined share of 80% of the vote, and the Liberals had also won more than 10% of the vote. The Liberals under Thorpe made their strongest showing since the 1929 election, which reflected a disenchantment with both Labour and the Conservatives by sections of the public. After the election, there were talks for a Conservative-Liberal coalition, which fell apart, leading for the Queen to ask Wilson to form a minority Labour government. The main stumbling block in the Heath-Thorpe talks were the latter&#x27;s demand for the end of the first-past-the-post electoral system, which did not favor the Liberals. Even if the Liberals and the Conservatives had formed a coalition, the government would have been 14 seats short of a majority. Heath intended to govern as if he had a majority by threatening another general election, which led to serious questions about the constitutional probity about this course if Heath should ask the Queen for another election if his government should be defeated in the Commons. The historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett when asked for his opinion advised the courtier Martin Charteris by quoting Arthur Balfour &quot;no constitution can subside on a diet of dissolutions&quot;, which was understood to mean that should an attempt should be made to form government before dissolving the House of Commons for another election fresh after an election.

<text>A wet nurse is a woman who breastfeeds and cares for another&#x27;s child. Wet nurses are employed if the mother dies, if she is unable to nurse the child herself sufficiently or chooses not to do so. Wet-nursed children may be known as &quot;milk-siblings&quot;, and in some societies, the families are linked by a special relationship of milk kinship. Wet-nursing existed in societies around the world until the invention of reliable formula milk in the 20th century. The practice has made a small comeback in the 21st century.

==Reasons==
A wet nurse can help when a mother is unable or unwilling to breastfeed her baby. Before the development of infant formula in the 20th century, wet-nursing could save a baby&#x27;s life.

There are many reasons why a mother is unable to produce sufficient breast milk, or in some cases to lactate at all. For example, she may have a chronic or acute illness, and either the illness itself, or the treatment for it, reduces or stops her milk. This absence of lactation may be temporary or permanent.

There was a greater need for wet nurses when the rates of infant abandonment and maternal death, during and shortly after childbirth, were high. There was a concurrent availability of lactating women whose own babies had died.

Some women chose not to breastfeed for social reasons. For upper-class women, breastfeeding was considered unfashionable, in the sense that it not only prevented them from being able to wear the fashionable clothing of their time, but it was also thought to ruin their figures. Hiring a wet nurse was less expensive than having to hire someone else to help run the family business and/or take care of the family household duties in their place. Some women chose to hire wet nurses purely to escape from the confining and time-consuming chore of breastfeeding.

==Eliciting milk==
A woman can only act as a wet nurse if she is lactating (producing milk). It was once believed that a wet nurse must have recently undergone childbirth in order to lactate. This is not necessarily the case, as regular breast stimulation can elicit lactation via a neural reflex of prolactin production and secretion. Some women have been able to establish lactation using a breast pump, in order to feed an infant.

Gabrielle Palmer, author of &quot;The Politics of Breastfeeding&quot;, states: 

==Historical and cultural practices==
Wet nursing is an ancient practice, common to many societies. It has been linked to social class, where monarchies, the aristocracy, nobility, or upper classes had their children wet-nursed for the benefit of the child&#x27;s health, and sometimes in the hope of becoming pregnant again quickly. Exclusive breastfeeding inhibits ovulation in some women (lactational amenorrhea). Poor women, especially those who suffered the stigma of giving birth to an illegitimate child, sometimes had to give their baby up temporarily to a wet nurse, or permanently to another family. The woman herself might in turn become wet nurse to a wealthier family, while using part of her wages to pay her own child&#x27;s wet nurse.

In pre-modern times, it was incorrectly believed that wet nurses could pass on personality traits to infants, such as acquired characteristics.

===Mythology===
Many cultures feature stories, historical or mythological, involving superhuman, supernatural, human, and in some instances, animal wet nurses.

The Bible refers to Deborah, a nurse to Rebekah, wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob (Israel) and Esau, who appears to have lived as a member of the household all her days. (Genesis 35:8.) Midrashic commentaries on the Torah hold that the Egyptian princess Bithiah (Pharaoh&#x27;s wife Asiya in the Islamic Hadith and Qur&#x27;an) attempted to wet-nurse Moses, but he would take only his biological mother&#x27;s milk. ()

In Greek mythology, Eurycleia is the wet nurse of Odysseus. In Roman mythology, Caieta was the wet nurse of Aeneas. In Burmese mythology, Myaukhpet Shinma is the &quot;nat&quot; (spirit) representation of the wet nurse of King Tabinshwehti. In Hawaiian mythology, Nuakea is a beneficent goddess of lactation; her name became the title for a royal wet nurse, according to David Malo.

===Ancient Rome===
In ancient Rome, well-to-do households would have had wet nurses (Latin , singular ) among their slaves and freedwomen, but some Roman women were wet nurses by profession, and the &quot;Digest&quot; of Roman law even refers to a wage dispute for wet-nursing services (). The landmark known as the Columna Lactaria (&quot;Milk Column&quot;) may have been a place where wet nurses could be hired. It was considered admirable for upperclass women to breastfeed their own children, but unusual and old-fashioned in the Imperial era. Even women of the working classes or slaves might have their babies nursed, and the Roman-era Greek gynecologist Soranus offers detailed advice on how to choose a wet nurse. Inscriptions such as religious dedications and epitaphs indicate that a would be proud of her profession. One even records a , a male &quot;milk nurse&quot; who presumably used a bottle. Greek nurses were preferred, and the Romans believed that a baby who had a Greek could the language and grow up speaking Greek as fluently as Latin.

The importance of the wet nurse to ancient Roman culture is indicated by the founding myth of Romulus and Remus, who were abandoned as infants but nursed by the she-wolf, as portrayed in the famous Capitoline Wolf bronze sculpture. The goddess Rumina was invoked among other birth and child development deities to promote the flow of breast milk.

===India===
By the 1500s, a wealthy mother who did not use a wet nurse was worthy of remark in India. The child was not &quot;put out&quot; of the household; rather, the wet nurse was included within it. The imperial wet nurses of the Mughal court were given honours in the Turco-Mongol tradition.

===United Kingdom===
Wet nursing used to be commonplace in the United Kingdom. Working-class women both provided and received wet-nursing services.

Taking care of babies was a well-paid, respectable, and popular job for many working-class women. In the 18th century, a woman would earn more money as a wet nurse than an average man could as a labourer. Up until the 19th century, most wet-nursed infants were sent far from their families to live with their new caregiver for up to the first three years of their life. As many as 80% of wet-nursed babies who lived like this died during infancy.

During the Victorian era, women took in babies for money and nursed them themselves or fed them with whatever was cheapest. This was known as baby-farming; poor care sometimes resulted in high infant death rates. The wet nurse at this period was most likely a single woman who previously had given birth to an illegitimate child. There were two types of wet nurses by this time: those on poor relief, who struggled to provide sufficiently for themselves or their charges, and the professionals, who were well paid and respected.

Upper-class women tended to hire wet nurses to work within their own homes, as part of a large household of servants.

Wet nurses also worked at foundling hospitals, establishments for abandoned children. Their own children would likely be sent away, normally brought up by the bottle rather than being breastfed. Valerie Fildes, author of &quot;Breasts, Bottle and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding&quot;, argues that &quot;In effect, wealthy parents frequently &#x27;bought&#x27; the life of their infant for the life of another.&quot;

Wet nursing decreased in popularity during the mid-19th century, as medical journalists wrote about its previously undocumented dangers. Fildes argued that &quot;Britain has been lumped together with the rest of Europe in any discussion of the qualities, terms of employment and conditions of the wet nurse, and particularly the abuses of which she was supposedly guilty.&quot; C. H. F. Routh, a medical journalist writing in the late 1850s, listed the evils of wet nursing, such as the abandonment of the wet nurses&#x27; own children, higher infant mortality, and an increased physical and moral risk to a nursed child. While this argument was not founded in any sort of proof, the emotional arguments of medical researchers, coupled with the protests of other critics, slowly increased public knowledge; the practice declined, replaced by maternal breastfeeding and bottle-feeding.

===France===

Wet-nursing was reported in France in the time of Louis XIV, the mid-17th century. By the 18th century, approximately 90% of infants were wet-nursed, mostly sent away to live with their wet nurses. In Paris, only 1,000 of the 21,000 babies born in 1780 were nursed by their own mothers. The high demand for wet nurses coincided with the low wages and high rent prices of this era, which forced many women to have to work soon after childbirth. This meant that many mothers had to send their infants away to be breastfed and cared for by wet nurses even poorer than themselves. With the high demand for wet nurses, the price to hire one increased as the standard of care decreased. This led to many infant deaths. In response, rather than nursing their own children, upper-class women turned to hiring wet nurses to come live with them instead. In entering into their employer&#x27;s home to care for their charges, these wet nurses had to leave their own infants to be nursed and cared for by women far worse off than themselves, and who likely lived at a relatively far distance away.

The Bureau of Wet Nurses was created in Paris in 1769 to serve two main purposes: it supplied parents with wet nurses, as well as helping lessen the neglect of babies by controlling monthly salary payments. In order to become a wet nurse, women had to meet a few qualifications, including physical fitness and good moral character; they were often judged on their age, their health, the number of children they had, as well as their breast shape, breast size, breast texture, nipple shape, and nipple size, since all these aspects were believed to affect the quality of a woman&#x27;s milk. In 1874, the French government introduced a law named after , which &quot;mandated that every infant placed with a paid guardian outside the parents&#x27; home be registered with the state so that the French government is able to monitor how many children are placed with wet nurses and how many wet-nursed children have died&quot;.

Wet nurses were hired to work in hospitals to nurse babies who were premature, ill, or abandoned. During the 18th and 19th centuries, congenital syphilis was a common cause of infant mortality. The Vaugirard hospital in Paris began to use mercury as a treatment; however, it could not be safely administered to infants. In 1780, it began the process of giving mercury to wet nurses, who could then transmit the treatment in their milk to infected infants.

The practice of wet-nursing was still widespread during World War I, according to the American Red Cross. Working-class women would leave their babies with wet nurses so they could get jobs in factories.

===United States===
British colonists brought the practice of wet-nursing with them to North America. Since the arrangement of sending infants away to live with wet nurses was the cause of so many infant deaths, by the 19th century, Americans adopted the practice of having wet nurses live with the employers in order to nurse and care for their charges. This practice had the effect of increasing the death rate for wet nurses&#x27; own babies. Many employers would have only kept a wet nurse for a few months at a time since it was believed that the quality of a woman&#x27;s breast milk would lessen over time.

Child-minding, different from wet-nursing, was also commonly an additional job on top of child rearing and nursery tending. Employed wet nurses were typically paid low wages and worked long hours. Workers in the 1900s demanded work contracts to provide stable wages. Wet nursing work was rarely consistent, wet nurses were stereotypically poor ladies from rural areas who offered their services for fees.

Since there were no official records kept pertaining to wet nurses or wet-nursed babies, historians lack the knowledge of precisely how many infants were wet-nursed and for how long, whether they lived at home or elsewhere, and how many lived or died. The best source of evidence is found in the &quot;help wanted&quot; ads of newspapers, through complaints about wet nurses in magazines, and through medical journals that acted as employment agencies.

====Slavery====
In the Southern United States before the Civil War, it was common practice for enslaved black women to be forced to be wet nurses to their owners&#x27; children. In some instances, the enslaved child and the white child would be raised together in their younger years. (Sometimes both babies would be fathered by the same man, the slave-owner; see Children of the plantation.) Visual representations of wet-nursing practices in enslaved communities are most prevalent in representations of the Mammy archetype caricature. Images such as the one in this section represent both a historically accurate practice of enslaved black women wet-nursing their owner&#x27;s white children, as well as sometimes an exaggerated racist caricaturization of a stereotype of a &quot;Mammy&quot; character.

===Egypt===
From the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s, and especially after World War I, thousands of Slovene peasant women migrated via Trieste to the cosmopolitan port city of Alexandria. There, these &quot;&quot; undertook various sorts of domestic work for elite Levantine households—&quot;the highly mobile upper strata of Ottoman millets, Jewish, Maronites, Melkite active in international commerce&quot;. Enough served as wet nurses that this occupation became almost synonymous with Slovene domestic workers, which resulted in some stigma back home. Married women could leave Alexandria and return to their home village, where they would conceive and bear a child and leave the infant to the care of relatives or a hired wet nurse, while they returned to Egypt to seek new employment and a new charge to nurse.

This constitutes the origin of the archetype of the as a wet nurse, which came to overpower any other representation of the , despite the fact that empirical evidence demonstrates that only a tiny fraction of at any time worked as wet nurses. The majority of were working as nannies or chamber maids, they were not breastfeeding the children they were taking care of. The emphasis on lactaction, which marks the hypersexualization of the , was part of the rhetorical stigma surrounding this phenomenon in Slovenia.

==Relationships==

Sometimes, the infant was placed in the home of the wet nurse for several months, as was the case for Jane Austen and her siblings. The Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 91, a receipt from AD 187, attests to the ancient nature of this practice. Sometimes, the wet nurse came to live with the infant&#x27;s family, filling a position between the monthly nurse (for the immediate post-partum period) and the nanny.

In some societies, the wet nurse was simply hired as any other employee. In others, however, she had a special relationship with the family, which could incur kinship rights. In Vietnamese family structure, for example, the wet nurse is known as , meaning &quot;mother&quot;. Islam has a highly codified system of milk kinship known as &quot;rada&quot;. George III of the United Kingdom, born two months premature, had a wet nurse whom he so valued all his life, that her daughter was appointed laundress to the Royal Household, &quot;a sinecure place of great emolument&quot;.

Mothers who nurse each other&#x27;s babies are engaging in a reciprocal act known as cross-nursing or co-nursing.

==Current attitudes in Western countries==
In contemporary affluent Western societies such as the United States, the act of nursing a baby other than one&#x27;s own often provokes cultural discomfort. When a mother is unable to nurse her own infant, an acceptable mediated substitute is expressed milk (or especially colostrum), which is donated to milk banks, analogous to blood banks, and processed there by being screened, pasteurized, and usually frozen. Infant formula is also widely available, which its makers claim can be a reliable source of infant nutrition when prepared properly. Dr. Rhonda Shaw notes that Western objections to wet nurses are cultural:
For some Americans, the subject of wet-nursing is becoming increasingly open for discussion. During a UNICEF goodwill tour to Sierra Leone in 2008, American Mexican actress Salma Hayek decided to breastfeed a local infant in front of the accompanying film crew. The sick one-week-old baby had been born the same day but a year later than Hayek&#x27;s daughter, who had not yet been weaned. The actress later discussed on camera an anecdote of her Mexican great-grandmother spontaneously breastfeeding a hungry baby in a village.

==Current situation elsewhere==
Wet nurses are still common in many developing countries, although the practice poses a risk of infections, such as HIV. In China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, a wet nurse may be employed in addition to a nanny as a mark of aristocracy, wealth, and high status. Following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, in which contaminated infant formula poisoned thousands of babies, the salaries of wet nurses there increased dramatically.

==Notable wet nurses==
Royal wet nurses are more likely than most to reach the historical record.

In Ancient Egypt, Maia was the wet nurse of King Tutankhamun. Sitre In, the nurse of Hatshepsut, was not a member of the royal family but received the honour of a burial in the royal necropolis in the Valley of the Kings, in tomb KV60. Her coffin has the inscription , meaning &quot;Great Royal Wet Nurse In&quot;.

In Asia, Lady Kasuga was the wet nurse of the third Tokugawa shōgun, Iemitsu. Lu Lingxuan was a lady in waiting who served as wet nurse to the emperor Gao Wei. She became exceedingly powerful during his reign and was often criticized by historians for her corruption and treachery. Chinese emperors honoured the Nurse empress dowager. Wet nurses were also common during the Mughal period, with almost every Mughal prince having one. Some prominent ones are Maham Anga for Akbar and Dai Anga for Shah Jahan. Shin Myo Myat was the mother of King Bayinnaung of the Toungoo dynasty of Burma (Myanmar), and the wet nurse of King Tabinshwehti. The last Emperor of China, Puyi, described Wang Lianshou as being the only person who was able to control him: &quot;from my infancy until the time I grew up, only my wet nurse, because of her simple language, was able to make me grasp the idea that I was like other people.&quot;

In Europe, Hodierna of St Albans was the mother of Alexander Neckam and wet nurse of Richard I of England, and Mrs. Pack was a wet nurse to William, Duke of Gloucester (1689–1700). Geneviève Poitrine was a wet nurse of the Dauphin of France, Louis Joseph, son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. Poitrine was accused of transmitting tuberculosis to the Dauphin and triggering his infant death when aged seven, although since very few pre-adolescent children die from TB, this accusation may have been the result of a misdiagnosis.

Some non-royal wet nurses have also been written about. Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb was the foster mother and wet nurse of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Petronella Muns was, with her employer, the first Western woman to visit Japan. Naomi Baumslag, author of &quot;Milk, Money and Madness&quot;, described the legendary capacity of Judith Waterford: &quot;In 1831, on her 81st birthday, she could still produce breast milk. In her prime she unfailingly produced two quarts (four pints or 1.9 litres) of breast milk a day.&quot;

<text>Gédéon Tallemant, Sieur des Réaux (7 November 1619 – 6 November 1692) was a French writer known for his &quot;Historiettes&quot;, a collection of short biographies.

==Biography==
Born at La Rochelle, he belonged to a wealthy middle-class Huguenot family; the name des Réaux was derived from a small property he purchased in 1650. When he was about eighteen, he was sent to Italy with his brother François, abbé Tallemant. On his return to Paris, Tallemant took his degrees in civil law and Canon law, and his father obtained for him the position of &quot;conseiller au parlement&quot;. Disliking his profession, he decided to seek an alternative income by marriage with his cousin Elisabeth de Rambouillet. His half-brother had married a d&#x27;Angennes, and this connection secured for Tallemant an introduction to the Hôtel de Rambouillet.

Madame de Rambouillet was no admirer of King Louis XIII, and she gratified Tallemant&#x27;s curiosity with stories of the reigns of Henry IV and Louis XIII that were of real historical value. The society of the Hôtel de Rambouillet opened a field for his acute and somewhat malicious observation. In the &quot;Historiettes&quot; he gives finished portraits of Vincent Voiture, Jean Louis Guez de Balzac, Malherbe, Jean Chapelain, Valentin Conrart and many others; Blaise Pascal and Jean de la Fontaine appear in his work; and he chronicles the scandals of which Ninon de l&#x27;Enclos and Angélique Paulet were centres.

The &quot;Historiettes&quot; are invaluable for the literary history of the time. It has been said that the malicious intention of Tallemant&#x27;s work may be partly attributed to his bourgeois extraction and that the slights he received are avenged in his pages, but independent testimony has established the substantial correctness of his statements. In 1685 he converted to Catholicism. It seems that the change was not entirely disinterested, for Tallemant, who had suffered considerable pecuniary losses, soon after received a pension of 2,000 livres. He died in Paris.

==Works==
Des Réaux was a poet and contributed to the &quot;Guirlande de Julie&quot;, but it is by his &quot;Historiettes&quot; that he is remembered. The work remained in manuscript until it was edited in 1834-6 by MM. de Châteaugiron, Jules Taschereau and Louis Monmerqué, with a notice on Tallemant by Monmerqué. A third edition (6 vols. 1872) contains a notice by Paulin Paris. Tallemant had begun &quot;Mémoires pour la régence d&#x27;Anne d&#x27;Autriche&quot;, but the manuscript has not been found.

<doc id="269689" wikidata="Q918508" url="?curid=269689" title="October 1974 United Kingdom general election">
<text>The October 1974 United Kingdom general election took place on Thursday 10 October 1974 to elect 635 members of the House of Commons. It was the second general election held that year; the first year that two general elections were held in the same year since 1910; and the first time that two general elections were held less than a year apart from each other since the 1923 and 1924 elections, which took place 10 months apart. 

The election resulted in a narrow victory for the Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, which won a wafer-thin majority of three seats, the narrowest in modern British history. It was to remain the last general election victory for the Labour Party until 1997, with the Conservative Party winning majorities in the next four general elections. It would also be the last time Labour won more seats at a national election than the Conservatives until the 1989 European Parliament election. This remains the most recent General Election that Labour made net gains in seats whilst in government.

The narrowness of the majority meant that the Labour government saw a gradual loss of its majority by 1977 through a series of by-election losses and defections, thus requiring deals with the Liberals, the Ulster Unionists, the Scottish Nationalists and the Welsh Nationalists. It led to the eventual defeat of the government in a no-confidence motion in March 1979, six months before the mandatory dissolution of Parliament was set to take place.

This election was held just seven months after the previous general election, held in February 1974, had led to a hung parliament, with Labour winning 301 seats and the Conservatives left with 297. Following the inconclusive nature of coalition talks between the Conservatives and other parties such as the Liberals and the Ulster Unionists, the Labour Leader Harold Wilson went on to form a minority government.

The October campaign was not as vigorous or exciting as the one in February. Despite continuing high inflation, Labour boasted that it had ended the miners&#x27; strike, which had dogged Heath&#x27;s premiership, and had returned some stability. The Conservative Party, led by Leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister Edward Heath, released a manifesto promoting national unity, but its chances of forming a government were hindered by the Ulster Unionist Party refusing to take the Conservative whip at Westminster in response to the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973.

Both the Conservatives and the Liberals saw their vote share decline, and Heath, who had lost three of the four elections that he contested, was ousted as Conservative leader in February 1975 and replaced with future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Scottish National Party won 30% of the Scottish popular vote and 11 of Scotland&#x27;s 71 seats in the party&#x27;s most successful general election result until 2015.

The election was broadcast live on the BBC and was presented by David Butler, Alastair Burnet, Robert McKenzie, Robin Day and Sue Lawley.
Since Jeremy Thorpe&#x27;s death in December 2014, this is the latest election where all the three major party leaders are deceased.

==Campaign==
The brief period between the elections gave Wilson the opportunity to demonstrate reasonable progress. Despite high inflation and high balance-of-trade deficits, the miners&#x27; strike, which had dogged Heath was over, and some stability had been restored. After the February election, Heath had remained largely out of the public eye.

As was expected, the campaign was not as exciting as the one in February, and overall coverage by broadcasters was significantly scaled back. The Conservatives campaigned on a manifesto of national unity in response to the mood of the public. Labour campaigned on its recent successes in government, and although the party was divided over Europe, the party&#x27;s strengths outweighed that of Heath, who knew that his future relied on an election victory. Devolution was a key issue for the Liberals and the Scottish National Party, and it was now one that the two main parties also felt the need to address. The Liberals did not issue a new manifesto but simply reissued the one they had created for the last election.

==Timeline==
Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s decision to call a general election on October 10th 1974 was reported in the newspapers that were dated September 9th 1974 and made a ministerial broadcast on television on 18 September to announce that the election would be held on 10 October, less than eight months since the previous election. The key dates were as follows:
==Results==
Labour achieved a swing of 2% against the Conservatives. It was the first time since 1922 that a government had won an overall majority with less than 40% of the vote, but the majority of only three seats. The Conservatives won just under 36% of the vote, their worst share since 1918. A slight drop in the Liberals&#x27; vote saw them suffer a net loss of one seat. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party added another 4 seats to their successes in the previous election and became the fourth-largest party.

Turnout was 72.8%, which was a significant decline on the February election&#x27;s 78.8% turnout.

<text>Alexis Paulin Paris (25 March 180013 February 1881) was a French scholar and author.

==Life==
Paris was born at Avenay (Marne). He studied classics in Reims and law in Paris. He published in 1824 an &quot;Apologie pour l&#x27;école romantique&quot; (&quot;In Defense of the Romantic school&quot;) and took an active part in Parisian journalism. His appointment, in 1828, to the department of manuscripts in the Bibliothèque royale left him leisure to pursue his studies in medieval French literature. His numerous editions of early French poems continued the work begun by Dominique Meon in raising general interest in the &quot;chanson de geste&quot;.

Admitted to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres in 1837, Paris was shortly afterwards appointed on the commission entrusted with the continuation of the &quot;Histoire littéraire de la France&quot;. In 1853, a chair of medieval literature was founded at the Collège de France, and Paris became the first occupant. He retired in 1872 with the title of honorary professor and was promoted to officer of the Legion of Honour in the next year.

==Works==
His works include:
*&quot;Li Romans de Berte aus grans piés, précédé d’une dissertation sur les romans des douze pairs&quot; (1832)
*&quot;Li Romans du Garin le Loherain, publié pour la première fois et précédé de l&#x27;examen du système de M. Fauriel sur les romans carlovingiens&quot; (1833-1835)
*&quot;Le Romancero français, histoire de quelques anciens trouvères et choix de leurs chansons&quot; (1833)
*&quot;Les Manuscrits français de la Bibliothèque du roi&quot; (7 vols., 1836-1848)
*an edition of the &quot;Grandes chroniques de France&quot; (1836-1840)
*&quot;La Chanson d&#x27;Antioche&quot; (1848)
*&quot;Les Aventures de maître Renart et d&#x27;Ysengrin&quot; (1861)
*&quot;Les Romans de la table ronde&quot; (1868-1877).

His son Gaston Paris contributed a biographical notice to vol. xxix of the &quot;Histoire littéraire&quot;.

<doc id="269714" wikidata="Q778059" url="?curid=269714" title="Artemis Fowl II">
<text>Dr. Artemis Fowl II is the eponymous character of the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series by Eoin Colfer. Colfer has said that he based Artemis on his younger brother Donal, who as a child was &quot;a mischievous mastermind who could get out of any trouble he got into.&quot; A childhood picture of his brother in his first communion suit caused Colfer to think of how much Colfer&#x27;s brother resembled &quot;a little &quot;James Bond&quot; villain&quot; and &quot;how funny...a twelve-year-old &quot;James Bond&quot; villain&quot; would be, inspiring Colfer&#x27;s creation of Artemis.

Colfer planned for Artemis to have been called Archimedes but changed the name due to an interest in using a &quot;classic Greek name&quot; and trepidation that &quot;people would think [the series] was about [the historical figure] Archimedes&quot;. Artemis is a notable choice for a name because while it is traditionally a female name, it &quot;was [historically] sometimes… given to boys as a kind of honorific if their fathers were great hunters&quot;, though the male equivalent of the name is usually spelled as Artimus instead of Artemis. Fowl was derived from the Irish name Fowler as a play on words to convey the characterisation that Artemis was a nasty or foul individual at the beginning of the series. The character additionally takes the place of Hans Gruber in Colfer&#x27;s description of the first book of the series as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; with fairies&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Plot===
Prior to the events of the first book, Artemis&#x27;s father, Artemis Fowl I, imperils the family fortune by investing &quot;a huge chunk of the Fowl fortune in establishing new shipping lanes&quot; to Russia, following the breakdown of Communism there. The Russian Mafia retaliates by sinking a shipping vessel Artemis I was travelling on, the &quot;Fowl Star&quot;, leading to his disappearance, the loss of a substantial amount of the Fowl fortune, and the mental breakdown of his wife Angeline Fowl, Artemis&#x27;s mother.

In &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;, which is set two years after those events, the 12-year-old Artemis decides to regain the Fowl fortune by following leads on the Internet that refer to an underground world of fairies collectively called the People. Artemis manages to blackmail a member of the People into giving him what they call &quot;the Book&quot; which is like their Bible, holding all their secrets, customs, rules, and history. This leads him to ransom Lower Elements Police (LEP) Captain Holly Short for a portion of the People&#x27;s gold. Artemis and Holly agree to a deal whereby Holly retains half the ransom fee, while Artemis gets one wish from Holly and gets to keep the other half of the gold. After recovering Holly, the LEP attempt to permanently eliminate Artemis by setting off a biological weapon, but are thwarted when Artemis discovers a way around their attack (something not even the People had been able to develop).

In the sequel, &quot;The Arctic Incident&quot;, the 13-year-old Artemis learns that his father was only injured in the attack on his shipping vessel, and is being held hostage by the Russian Mafia. Artemis barters with the People to receive their aid in rescuing his father in exchange for assisting them in solving the mystery of who was behind a goblin rebellion. It is later revealed that Opal Koboi, a pixie criminal mastermind, and ex-LEP officer Briar Cudgeon are behind the plot. Their plan is thwarted, ending in Cudgeon&#x27;s death and Koboi&#x27;s arrest, and Artemis successfully recovers his father.

In the third book, &quot;The Eternity Code&quot;, Artemis (in what he considers to be his last criminal act before his father recovers from his injuries) creates the C Cube, a mini super-computer based on the People&#x27;s technology that is decades ahead of human technology. He plans to make a deal with Chicago technology businessman Jon Spiro over the Cube, but Spiro double-crosses Artemis, steals the Cube, and wounds Domovoi Butler in the process. Along with Holly Short and Foaly, Artemis succeeds in healing Butler and ensuring that Spiro does not discover the existence of the People through use of the C Cube. The C Cube is recovered, with the help of Foaly, Holly, Juliet (Butler&#x27;s sister), and Mulch. But to gain the help of Foaly, Holly, and their Fairy technology, Artemis has to agree to Butler&#x27;s, Juliet&#x27;s and his own memories being wiped by the People, to avoid future misadventures. This happens at the end of the book.

In the fourth book, &quot;The Opal Deception&quot;, Opal Koboi, who had been lying in an institution in a faked catatonic state, escapes with the help of pixie twins Mervall and Descant Brill, and begins plotting revenge against Julius Root, Holly Short, Foaly, and Artemis. Opal frames Holly for the murder of Julius Root and nearly terminates the now 14-year-old Artemis and Butler with a biological weapon. Holly rescues Artemis after being injured while escaping Opal&#x27;s weapon. But Opal still seeks revenge on Holly and Artemis, so she traps them in an abandoned amusement park (comprising copies of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World plus four extra monuments determined by the People) with only hungry trolls for company. Meanwhile, Mulch Diggums has helped Butler regain his memories and together they save Holly and Artemis in the nick of time and also return Artemis&#x27;s memory. With help from Artemis, Butler, and Mulch, Holly prevents Opal from achieving her goal to uncover the Fairy People to humans.

In the fifth book, &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, Artemis works with the People to recover a young kidnapped demon imp from the 12-year-old child prodigy Minerva Paradizo. The team succeed in finding and rescuing the imp-warlock, but Artemis and Holly Short must then work to restore the imp&#x27;s home, a floating island lost in a space and time Limbo, which threatens to breach its way onto Earth. In the process, several significant changes occur within the characters&#x27; lives. Artemis receives a small amount of magical power during the trip to Limbo, and swaps an eye with Holly on the return trip. The pair finds that they have been transported nearly three years into their future. Finally, Artemis learns that in the ensuing time he has become the older brother to twins, Beckett and Myles Fowl.

In the sixth book, &quot;The Time Paradox&quot;, Artemis&#x27; mother Angeline Fowl becomes gravely ill with a rare fairy disease called Spelltropy. Artemis attempts to cure her with his remaining magic, but it only serves to worsen her condition. The only cure for Spelltropy is found in the brain fluid of the Silky Sifaka Lemur, the last of which Artemis sold in a business deal when he was ten years old, resulting in the extinction of the species. To get Holly to help him, Artemis falsely accuses her of exposing his mother to magic, which led to her developing the disease. Holly believes Artemis and, ridden with guilt, accompanies him to the past to rescue the last lemur from his younger self. After several misadventures, Artemis recovers the lemur but learns that his mother&#x27;s illness was a ruse plotted by Opal Koboi, who wanted the lemur&#x27;s brain fluid to increase her own magical powers. Artemis ruins Opal&#x27;s plans by bringing his ten-year-old self into the present and fooling Opal, saving his mother in the process. Opal flees, but returns again as Artemis appears to take the lemur and fly off the manor&#x27;s grounds in his Cessna. She chases him, following the thermal read of the lemur and slowly destroying the plane until it crashes on the shoreline. At the crash site, the two stand off until she discovers that the lemur is actually only a decoy, fitted with a thermal read to trick Opal. Before she can further injure Artemis, he shoots the boulder she&#x27;s on, and it is shown that it was in fact the shell of a kraken she stood on, built up with gases that exploded with the pressure of Artemis&#x27;s shot. The LEP team later informs Artemis that Opal&#x27;s body was not recovered from the rubble. As a result of Opal meddling with her mind, Angeline Fowl learns of Artemis&#x27; contact with the People, and she asks Artemis to tell her the truth. Artemis&#x27; 10-year-old self has his mind wiped by Nº1, but retains a brief memory of the existence of fairies,
which spurs him to research them, ultimately leading to the events of the first book, which is one of the reasons Artemis is loved 
so much.

In the seventh book, &quot;The Atlantis Complex&quot;, Artemis contracts a mental disease called Atlantis Complex disease, similar to OCD, and now has an alter-ego named Orion, who is in love with Holly Short. Due to the disease, Artemis finds himself obsessed with the number 5 and irrationally fearing the number 4. The disease worsens throughout the novel, leading to his distrust of close friends. A neutrino shock from Holly Short frees Artemis&#x27; alter-ego Orion but he comes back after being knocked out by a buzz baton blow from Holly. He later undergoes Atlantis Complex Disease treatment by the fairies, curing him and restoring his former self.

In the eighth book, &quot;The Last Guardian&quot;, Artemis must save humankind by stopping the crazed pixie Opal Koboi. Opal kills her younger self (who followed Artemis and Holly to the present in the sixth book) to gain enough black magic to open a magical gate, which has been under the Fowl Manor for a millennium, and so release the Berserkers (ancient fairy warriors). Then Artemis must fight his brothers, who have been taken over by the Berserker souls. He sacrifices himself at the conclusion of the book to trigger an ancient spell that disperses Opal and her various fairy spirits, but since his spirit was human (apart from some traces of fairy magic from Holly&#x27;s borrowed eye), his essence endures at the location of the spell long enough for Holly and Foaly to clone a new body for him and transfer his soul into it. Although the process leaves him with missing memories, the book ends with Butler, Holly and Foaly immediately beginning work to restore them.

In &quot;The Fowl Twins&quot;—the first of a series of novels focusing on Artemis&#x27;s younger twin brothers Beckett and Myles—it is mentioned that Artemis is currently six months into a five-year mission to Mars in a wind-up rocket he built in the family barn. He is accompanied by Butler, but has left his younger brothers Beckett and Myles under the &#x27;guardianship&#x27; of NANNI, an artificial intelligence he created from combining his and Holly&#x27;s brainwaves, with Artemis&#x27; intelligence and Holly&#x27;s voice and mannerisms. Holly herself has now been promoted to Commodore and appears at the end of the novel, the narrative observing that a combined grin and grimace is a traditional expression for anyone who spends prolonged time with the Fowls. In the third book, &quot;The Fowl Twins Get What They Deserve&quot;, Minerva Paradizo mentions that prior to meeting her sprite husband and having a daughter with him, she and Artemis had briefly explored a relationship. Artemis himself remains in space for the remainder of the series.

== Characterization ==
=== Family history ===
Artemis Fowl II is the son of Artemis Fowl I and Angeline Fowl. He is a brother to younger twins Beckett and Myles Fowl. As shown in the fifth and seventh book, Artemis&#x27; birthday is 1 September. The Fowls are a family of &quot;legendary criminals&quot; whose history dates back to at least the Norman Conquest that have amassed a fortune through both legitimate and illegitimate means. Working alongside the Fowls is the Butler family, a centuries-old line of trained bodyguards that form lifelong affiliations with members of the Fowl family. The family motto is &quot;Aurum Est Potestas&quot;, (Gold is Power), which is written in Latin. Artemis Fowl I underwent reform following his kidnapping and has joined Angeline Fowl in her humanitarian and environmentalist efforts.

=== Physical appearance ===
Artemis is described as having pale skin, deep blue eyes, ruggedly handsome, premature wrinkling near the eyes, and raven black hair. He is said to resemble his father. As of his adventures in &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, Artemis has exchanged one eye with Holly Short as a result of a botched re-materialization and now possesses one blue eye and one hazel eye, and a time travel in &quot;The Time Paradox&quot; aged him to his chronological age of 18 but then back again upon his return to his own time. A similar re-materialization resulted in the swapping of the index and second fingers on his left hand. His smile is called vampire-like, and he maintains manicured hands. Artemis has a slight build and is not physically fit. He often wears Armani suits. It is also mentioned by himself that his first suit was a Zegna custom made as worn by Holly in &quot;The Time Paradox&quot;. As of &quot;The Last Guardian&quot;, Artemis has reverted to his image as it was at the start of the series due to being placed in a new body grown by Foaly when he lost his during Opal&#x27;s attempt to dominate the world and wipe out the human race. He now possesses two blue eyes and all fingers are back in their original place. It is noted, however, that Artemis has the physical appearance of a boy just over the age of 15 and now also has six toes on his left foot, shortly to be removed.

=== Personality ===
Colfer describes Artemis&#x27; personality at the beginning of the series as being difficult. A description of the twelve-year-old Artemis in &quot;The Artemis Fowl Files&quot; finds that &quot;he may isolate himself completely from anyone wishing to be his friend and, ultimately, from his family too&quot;. However, Artemis also reveals in the same text that Butler is his best friend. Artemis later acknowledges his father, Holly, and Butler as figures of respect following the events of &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident&quot;. Following &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code&quot;, Holly Short and Foaly both express regret at Artemis&#x27; mindwipe. As the series progresses, Holly describes him as a friend. Artemis then acknowledges that he considers Holly, Julius Root, and Mulch Diggums to be friends as well. Artemis realizes that his adventures and new friendships have changed him for the better. Foaly later acknowledges Artemis as a friend of the People. Artemis admits feeling conflicted about wanting to be a criminal but also wanting to be a normal teen. Ultimately, Artemis uses his abilities to help the People because he feels that he owes them for the past trouble he has caused, and he misses the challenges that their problems present. 

On the other hand, his &#x27;alternate personality&#x27; (Orion) is almost the opposite. He is childish and possibly over-familiar, addressing Foaly as the &#x27;noble steed&#x27; and treating Holly as his &#x27;fair maiden&#x27;. His use of language is also very different, speaking as if he is a knight in a fantastical dragon-slaying story. Artemis hates lollipops, as well as other desserts. The intention of Artemis&#x27; development has been to explore the development of a &quot;boy [that] becomes a young man and learns that avarice is not as important as family.&quot; Colfer has noted that once Artemis &quot;gets completely good, that&#x27;s it&quot; for his criminal ways.

=== Relationships ===
During &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, Artemis meets a girl called Minerva Paradizo, another child prodigy aware of the existence of magic, and develops an apparent attraction to her, but this relationship is not fully explored before Artemis and Holly are transferred to the Lost Colony, where they remain for about three years, limiting Artemis&#x27;s potential interest in getting back in contact with her. She is not mentioned in any of the other books. Artemis may have a possible romantic relationship with Holly Short. Though they start out as fierce enemies, they gradually learn to respect each other, and then to like each other. By the end of the fourth book they are good friends, and in the last book is described as having &quot;tremendous affection for his fierce and beautiful best friend.&quot;

In &quot;The Time Paradox&quot;, the two kiss and seem to take pleasure in it, although Holly was suffering from somewhat disturbed hormones due to the time travel disrupting her body&#x27;s chemistry. Also, in &quot;The Atlantis Complex&quot;, Artemis&#x27;s alter ego, Orion, confesses his love to Holly and tries to woo her, although she is unnerved by his advances. In the last book, Artemis and Holly are in a crisis and Artemis finally realizes his affection for Holly and kisses her on the forehead which seems to be solely for romantic reasons, however, it is later revealed that this was also for the practical reason of allowing Foaly to have access to Artemis&#x27; DNA sample to create a clone and revive him. By the time of &quot;The Fowl Twins&quot;, Artemis has created an artificial intelligence named NANNI (Nano Artificial Neural Network Intelligence system) in Holly&#x27;s image, who views the pair as her parents, while regularly communicating with Artemis while on his mission to Mars alongside Butler. In &quot;The Fowl Twins Get What They Deserve&quot; Minerva Paradizo reveals that she and Artemis had briefly explored having a relationship between the events of the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; and &quot;The Fowl Twins&quot; series, before she had left him for a sprite, with whom she had a hybrid daughter.

He obviously cares deeply for his mother, father, and brothers, and where they are concerned, acts much like a young boy who just wants to be taken care of by his parents. He also cares about Domovoi Butler very much, and has an ongoing rivalry with Foaly over who is more brilliant. He also has a pseudo-friendship with Mulch, and it is Mulch who eventually delivers the disk that helps him restore his memory after the events of &quot;The Eternity Code&quot;. Many details of Artemis&#x27;s personal life are left open ended. As is stated in the first book, &quot;[those questions] can only be answered by one person. And he delights in not talking.&quot;

=== Aliases ===
Artemis also uses pseudonyms to hide his identity. Some names include a play on words, such as Dr. F. Roy Dean Schlippe (Freudian slip), Emmesey Squire (E=mc2), Dr. C. Niall DeMencha (senile dementia), and Sir E. Brum (cerebrum).
Other identities include Stefan Bashkir (Russian child chess prodigy as well as character from &quot;The Supernaturalist&quot;), Alfonse Lee (a teenager visiting the International Bank with his father), Malachy Pasteur (French-Irish Extinctionist), Art Fowler (Vending Warehouse Owner, also referenced in Half-Moon Investigations), and Violet Tsirblou (Violets are blue). Domovoi Butler usually adapts to the new identities by assuming the role of the father or guardian, including Constantin Bashkir and Colonel Xavier Lee. Artemis also disguises fairy weaponry or other questionable items for his new identities by passing them off as games or toys.

=== Skills and abilities ===
Artemis is a child prodigy and is known to have the highest tested IQ in Europe. He is described as &quot;a plotter…[and]…a schemer&quot; with &quot;the ability to visualize a hypothetical situation and calculate the likely outcomes&quot;. His professors at Saint Bartleby&#x27;s School for Young Gentlemen acknowledge that his intellect is beyond what they may offer in the fields of literature, history, science, and mathematics. The English teacher has given him a library pass during his class and the History teacher let him try to build a time machine during her class. She thinks that he can do it. He has published articles in psychology journals and delivered a lecture on Balkan politics, and has made several patents. Additionally, Artemis shows talent in music when he is able to compose an ending and add extra notes to many famous pieces of music by composers such as Bach and Beethoven. He speaks fluent Gnommish, some Spanish, and speaks Russian with an impeccable accent. He also speaks French, and is able to read lips. He is skilled in detecting and creating forgeries.
In addition to these abilities, Artemis holds several other fringe talents. He can allegedly type &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; in less than twenty minutes giving him the minimum typing speed of 7525 words per minute. He is ambidextrous, but his left hand is slightly steadier (his other personality, Orion, is also ambidextrous, but favours his right hand). He apparently has perfect pitch, as he was able to label a pitch as high C in &quot;Artemis Fowl: The Lost Colony&quot;. Finally, Artemis is a trained pilot and equestrian. Between the events of &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; and &quot;The Time Paradox&quot;, Artemis holds a small amount of clandestinely gathered magic from his extra-dimensional travels. The magic gives him symptoms of being a magical being, such as nausea upon entering a building uninvited. The ability was lost after a failed healing on his mother. As &#x27;Orion&#x27;, he expresses more physical coordination than as &#x27;Artemis&#x27;. He shows &quot;a nimbleness that anyone who knew the boy would not associate with him&quot; and successfully winded Turnball with a move he learned (but Artemis did not) from Butler. He is also able to shoot Holly under circumstances which Holly (under the influence of a rune) claims Artemis would not.

== Valuables and possessions ==
Artemis has accessed many possessions for implementing his plots throughout the series. Those include his computers and the cache of Lower Elements Police equipment collected during the events of the first book. One of his most prized possessions given to him by Holly Short at the end of &quot;The Arctic Incident&quot; was a fairy coin that she shot a hole through using the trigger finger he and Julius Root helped her to heal, to remind him &quot;that deep beneath the layers of deviousness...[he has]...a spark of decency&quot;. Another gift from Holly Short is a fairy communicator Artemis has disguised as a &quot;rather ostentatious&quot; ring.

Possessions used in his exploits also include Fowl Manor, a late medieval, early modern castle on , a Learjet (which is flown by Juliet, but he claims to fly), a Bentley Arnage Red Label, a Sikorsky helicopter, and a solar powered Cessna aircraft. He also considers his collection of Impressionist art to be the only material asset worth travelling in a time stream for. Artemis&#x27;s exact cash worth is uncertain, but he is known to have stolen approximately $15 million worth of gold from the fairy ransom fund, in the original novel. In the third book, after Jon Spiro&#x27;s attempt on his life, Artemis retaliated by completely draining his accounts. He donated the bulk of the money to Amnesty International, but chose to keep ten percent of it (about $300 million) for himself. He has appeared on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Fictional 15 three times, placing third on the list in 2011, with a net worth of approximately $13,500,000,000.

<text>The Fowl Adventures is a series of eleven fantasy novels written by Irish author Eoin Colfer revolving around various members of the Fowl family. The first cycle, the eight-book Artemis Fowl, follows elf Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance (LEPRecon) officer Holly Short as she faces the forces of criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II; later on in the cycle the adversaries are forced to work together, gradually becoming firm friends/brief love interests while saving the world. The second cycle, the three-book The Fowl Twins, received commercial success and positive critical reception. It has also originated graphic novel adaptations. In 2010, &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; was selected by readers and voters as their favorite Puffin Books title of all time.

A film adaptation based on the first novel was in the process of development by Disney from 2016, and eventually released on the Disney+ streaming service on June 12, 2020 to a poor reception, before being removed from the service on May 26, 2023.

==Series overview==
In the first book, &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;, pitched as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; with fairies&quot;, twelve-year-old child prodigy Artemis Fowl II and his bodyguard Butler kidnap Holly Short, an elf and a captain of the Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance force (LEPrecon), holding her for a ransom of one ton of gold to exploit the magical Fairy People and restore his family&#x27;s fortune.

The &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series, alternatively titled the First Cycle of &quot;The Fowl Adventures&quot;, introduces Artemis as a villain and the Peoples&#x27; enemy, but as the books progress, Artemis&#x27;s character develops and changes. As an anti-villain, he assists the People and a reluctant Short in resolving conflicts with worldwide ramifications. His moral compass develops throughout the series.

&quot;The Fowl Twins&quot; series, alternatively titled the Second Cycle of &quot;The Fowl Adventures&quot;, set five years later, follows Artemis&#x27; younger twin brothers as they live out their house arrest under the supervision of &quot;pixel&quot; Lazuli Heitz, an elf-pixie hybrid, and NANNI, an artificial intelligence based on Holly&#x27;s and Artemis&#x27; brainwaves.

===&quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;===

====&quot;Artemis Fowl&quot;====
&quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; is the first book in the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series. It follows Holly Short, the first female reconnaissance officer of the Lower Elements Police (LEP), after she is kidnapped by criminal mastermind Artemis Fowl II for a large ransom of 24-karat gold with the help of his bodyguard Domovoi Butler (and Butler&#x27;s younger sister Juliet) in order to restore the Fowl family fortune. After multiple failed attempts by the LEP to undermine his plot, the book concludes with Artemis finally releasing Holly, in exchange for having his mother cured of madness and half of the ransomed gold that he had persuaded the fairies to give him restored to them, manipulating the LEP&#x27;s honor system and time-stop to prevent them from killing him afterward.

====&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident&quot;====

&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident&quot; is the second book of the series. It follows the rescue of Artemis&#x27;s father Artemis Fowl I from the Russian Mafia, alongside the battle against the B&#x27;wa Kell goblin gang who have allied themselves with the maniacal genius pixie Opal Koboi and officer Briar Cudgeon helping her out. The LEP originally suspects Artemis of orchestrating the goblin rebellion, but he is cleared of all suspicion after being inspected with a Retimager. Holly Short, an LEP captain; Julius Root, the LEP commander; and Foaly, a centaur and the main technology supervisor for the LEP, make an agreement with Artemis to work together to stop the goblin rebellion, with the help of Mulch Diggums half-way through. In the end, to fulfill their part of the agreement, they help Artemis find his father, who had been missing for the past two or three years.

====&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code&quot;====

&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code&quot; covers Jon Spiro&#x27;s theft of the fictional C Cube and its recovery. Jon Spiro is an American businessman who has his bodyguard Arno Blunt kill Butler and steals Artemis&#x27;s C Cube, which is a handheld supercomputer that he made from stolen fairy technology left over from the Fowl Manor siege in book 1. Artemis puts Butler into a fish freezer in an emergency attempt at cryonic preservation, and he is eventually resurrected by the elf Holly Short. Mulch Diggums (under the pseudonym Mo Digence) is hired alongside Loafers McGuire by Spiro to kidnap Artemis to access the C Cube, which is encrypted by an Eternity Code only Artemis knows how to decrypt. Holly agrees to help, but with the condition that Artemis and his allies are to be mind-wiped. With the help of the dwarf and Butler&#x27;s sister, Juliet, they raid Spiro Needle, the building housing Spiro&#x27;s company, and retrieve the C Cube again. The book ends with the fairies and Foaly mind-wiping the three humans, and Artemis gives Mulch Diggums a (supposed) medallion that Holly gave to Artemis in &quot;The Arctic Incident&quot;, which is actually a disc that will bring back his memories of the fairies.

====&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception&quot;====

The fourth book, &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception&quot;, covers power-hungry and insane pixie Opal Koboi&#x27;s second attempt at world domination, after her first fruitless attempt in the second novel. Koboi mesmerizes Giovanni Zito, a fictional environmentalist, into believing that she is his daughter, Belinda. She then convinces Giovanni to send a probe into the ground, which could lead to the uncovering of the fairy world, thrusting the fairy city of Haven into human clutches. In the process of stopping her, Commander Root is killed and the mind-wiped Artemis and Butler are saved from her bio-bomb. The two have their memories restored from the medallion, and Mulch, Artemis, Holly, and Butler thwart Opal Koboi yet again.

====&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony&quot;====

&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony&quot; involves bringing the demon island Hybras back from &quot;Limbo&quot; with the help of N°1, a powerful demon warlock. Artemis, Butler, Holly, Mulch, and Foaly reunite after Artemis encounters a demon from the island Hybras, and Holly and Mulch capture the pixie fish smuggler Doodah Day. Foaly tells them after the Battle of Taillte, the war for land against fairy and human, the demon fairy family sent themselves out of time on the island Hybras, and that on their island their time can be anything on ours. The time spell is crumbling, and demons are appearing on earth without warning. If the humans discover the demons, they will inevitably uncover the rest of the fairies. Artemis and his friends go after the demon warlock N°1, who is kidnapped by child prodigy Minerva Paradizo. Minerva intends to present N°1 to humans as a ploy to win the Nobel Prize. She eventually lets go of her project and joins them after Billy Kong, her security guard, turns against her in her own home. Artemis, Holly, N°1, and Qwan, another demon warlock, travel through time and space to Hybras, which Artemis had planned to get rid of with the live bomb Billy Kong had given Holly to annihilate the demons in Hybras, due to his belief that his brother was killed by a gang of demons. In Hybras, the pack leader Leon Abbot (N&#x27;Zall) and his army of demons fight Artemis and his friends. They knock Leon unconscious and create a bomb explosion powerful enough for them to use its energy – converting it into enough magic to send the island back to earth, where three years have passed because of the time spell. Unfortunately, Holly and Artemis find out that in the process of being brought back in time, they have swapped an eye. Artemis now has one hazel eye and one blue eye. Same with Holly. The book ends with Holly finding out that Mulch has recruited Doodah Day, and Artemis finds out that he is the brother of toddlers.

====&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox&quot;====

Artemis&#x27;s mother, Angeline Fowl, becomes ill with Spelltropy, and the only cure lies in the brain fluids of the silky sifaka lemur, the last of which Artemis sold to a group named the Extinctionists when he was 10 to procure money to fund the expedition to search for his father. N°1 sends Artemis and Holly to the past, where Artemis must battle his former self to recover the last silky sifaka lemur before the younger Artemis kills it in a business transaction with Damon Kronski, the leader of the Extinctionists. When Artemis almost dies, a relieved Holly kisses him but turns neutral once Artemis admits he lied to her regarding the disease his mother &quot;got from Holly&quot;. Things get more complicated when Opal Koboi is revealed to be controlling the Extinctionists and feeding on the brain fluids of many extremely rare animals. These fluids grant her special abilities and extraordinary prowess in certain fields (particularly the magical). The chase finally leads to the past and future Artemises reaching an agreement, whereupon Artemis and Holly are teleported to the future, while past Artemis is mind-wiped. Near to the ending, Opal is revealed to have possessed Angeline Fowl. At the close of the book, past Artemis wakes from a dream with thoughts of fairies, which suggests that Artemis&#x27;s time travel was the catalyst for his kidnapping scheme in &quot;Artemis Fowl.&quot;

====&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex&quot;====

Artemis contracts Atlantis Complex, a fairy condition resembling a combination of obsessive-compulsive disorder, extreme paranoia, and multiple personality disorder. This was brought on by Artemis stealing fairy magic from the time tunnel. This results in the debut of Orion Fowl, his alter ego. The idea is that Orion is Artemis&#x27;s enemy from Greek mythology. The story follows Turnball Root, the criminal brother of Julius Root, as he breaks out of jail and sends probes to destroy his enemies, including Artemis, his fairy friends, and Butler, whom Artemis sent away due to his Atlantis Complex induced paranoia. After Butler, Artemis, and his fairy friends reunite, they hunt down Turnball, tracking him with a computer orb connected to the probes that Artemis found underwater, and find out that Turnball has kidnapped demon warlock N°1 to force him to reverse the aging of Turnball&#x27;s wife, Leonor. In the end, Leonor and Turnball are killed in an explosion of a shuttle Leonor drives, to fulfill her last wish – to fly once again – and Artemis is sent to a fairy clinic to be cured of Atlantis Complex.

====&quot;Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian&quot;====

The final book of the original series, &quot;Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian&quot;, was released on 10 July 2012. Opal Koboi opens the Berserker&#x27;s Gate, a portal located on the Fowl Estate, in which dwell the spirits of fairy soldiers, the last victims of the Battle of Taillte, the final blow in the war that sent the Fairy People underground. Artemis, after his last session of being cured of Atlantis Complex, rushes to stop her along with Holly Short and Butler. They fail, and Opal opens the first gate, which releases the spirits of the warriors into the living world. The warriors begin to possess other people and animals around them, including corpses, animals, Juliet Butler, and Artemis&#x27;s toddler brothers, Myles and Beckett. After escaping Opal and the possessed beings, they attempt to stop Opal from opening the second gate, which will unleash the power of Danu destroying every human on the surface. While doing so, they (reluctantly) battle Artemis&#x27;s possessed toddler brother Myles, who reveals to them Opal&#x27;s plan after the fairy warrior spirit left his body. Artemis and his friends fail to destroy the second gate with a laser he created, and Mulch saves them from possessed pirate corpses, causing the spirits of fairy warriors to leave their bodies to the afterlife. They then enter Fowl Manor, where Artemis decides to sacrifice himself in order to stop Opal from opening the second gate. Foaly sends the clone of Opal that she created in the 4th book, and using her hand he is able to make the clone close the gates since the magic recognizes the clone&#x27;s DNA as Opal&#x27;s. All the fairies in the circle are drawn to the afterlife, and as Artemis has one of Holly&#x27;s eyes from book five, Artemis is also sent to the afterlife. However, Artemis&#x27;s humanity and sheer willpower enables his spirit to stay on Earth. Foaly prepares a clone of Artemis, which is taken to the now overgrown gate six months after Artemis&#x27;s death. Artemis&#x27;s spirit then takes control of the clone and he is alive once more. His eye color is now back to normal, with three blue eyes.

===&quot;The Fowl Twins&quot;===
The &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series was followed by a spin-off sequel series, called &quot;The Fowl Twins&quot;, centered around the characters of Myles and Beckett Fowl, Artemis&#x27;s younger twin brothers. The first book in the series was released on 5 November 2019.

====&quot;The Fowl Twins Deny All Charges&quot;====

&quot;The Fowl Twins Deny All Charges&quot; is the second book in the series, and was released on 20 October 2020.

====&quot;The Fowl Twins Get What They Deserve&quot;====

===Future===
In November 2020, Eoin Colfer indicated interest in bringing the franchise to another medium, such as a musical. In November 2021, Colfer revealed he had thought about writing a &quot;&quot; follow-up to the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series inspired by &quot;Old Man Logan&quot;, following an older Artemis as he becomes a magnate and exploring his and Holly&#x27;s relationship. In December 2021, Colfer also expressed interest in writing a book about Mulch Diggums as a private investigator, a concept first explored in &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, saying &quot;I never say never&quot; regarding a potential return at some point in the future to him writing novels set in the Fowl universe.

==Characters==
===Artemis Fowl===

Artemis Fowl II uses his intelligence to build his family fortune through crime. This stems from his family, who have been criminals for generations. Artemis is cold, cynical, and often outright ruthless in his manipulation of people for his own ends. Following his father&#x27;s presumed death at the hands of the Russian Mafia, and his mother&#x27;s subsequent descent into madness, Artemis stopped attending his boarding school, assumed control of the Fowl criminal empire, and embarked on a crime spree to restore the family fortune and fund Arctic expeditions to rescue his father. His investigation into the supernatural eventually leads him into contact with the People in the first book. Due to a strict upbringing, and a lack of any intellectual equals to ground him, Artemis is socially awkward, his best friend and bodyguard Butler being one of the few individuals whom Artemis trusts. He is very pale with raven-black hair and blue eyes. In &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, Holly Short and he switch eyes, leaving him with one blue eye and one hazel eye. Artemis is famed for his intelligence; he claims to have the &quot;highest IQ tested in Europe&quot;, but is also known for a lack of coordination and athletic ability. Throughout the series, he learns profound morals from the Fairy People and becomes more compassionate and trustworthy, but still maintains much of his intelligence. Because of the time travel in &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, his legal age is older than his real age.

===Domovoi Butler===
Butler is the Fowl family&#x27;s loyal manservant and Artemis&#x27;s bodyguard and friend, accompanying him around the world on his adventures. He is the third-most skilled martial artist on the planet (the first is a monk on a Pacific Island and the second is his uncle), a formidable marksman and firearms expert, and has immense experience of the criminal underworld, often providing help to Artemis through his many contacts. His first name is Domovoi though no one knows that besides Artemis and Juliet. He also has a little sister, Juliet, who appears in most of the books. Butler is rendered dead temporarily in &quot;The Eternity Code&quot;, but is rescued by the ingenuity of his principal and the healing powers of Holly Short. Butler&#x27;s favored weapon is a treasured SIG Sauer P226 pistol chambered in 9mm Parabellum, but he often must resort to other fairy weaponry for his tasks. Due to his healing in &quot;The Eternity Code&quot;, his body is older than he should be.

===Holly Short===

Holly is a determined, forthright elf and the only female captain of LEPrecon, the reconnaissance division of the LEP. Holly is three feet tall and slender, with nut-brown skin and auburn hair. In the first book, she is kidnapped by Artemis and held for ransom, but over the course of the series they slowly become friends--and by the end of the series, best friends. She helped Artemis save the world on numerous occasions. Holly holds a disregard for the rules and orders given to her. She is also one of the best pilots in LEPrecon.

===Foaly===

Foaly is a centaur, technical genius, and computer geek. He works for the LEP, the fairy authorities, and is in charge of preventing humankind from discovering the fairy civilization. His intelligence makes him paranoiac, which causes him to wear a foil hat to &quot;protect him from human mind-probing technology&quot;. He designs most of the weaponry, wings, and other technical gadgets that the LEP use, such as the &#x27;Iris Cam&#x27;. His sarcasm and talkative nature often annoy LEP officers, though his greatest pleasure outside of his engineering is aggravating the notoriously bad-tempered Commander Root. He &#x27;hitches&#x27; or marries a centaur named Caballine in &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; while Captain Short and Artemis are in Limbo, and apparently has foals. He has a rivalry with Opal Koboi, which she sporadically mentions throughout her dialogue.

===Opal Koboi===

Opal is a deranged, paranoid genius pixie whose dream is world domination and the destruction of the LEP. A prodigy, she built Koboi Laboratories, a technology company, which she used to crush her father&#x27;s company out of spite. Opal is featured in several of the Artemis Fowl books as the main antagonist. She detests Foaly, as he won a science competition in college over her, and she believes the judges chose Foaly instead just because he was male. However, she became Artemis&#x27; archenemy after he and Holly foiled her plans numerous times. In &quot;The Opal Deception&quot;, she creates a clone of herself to escape imprisonment, later killing Julius Root rather violently with a bomb, and framing Holly Short. In the past, it is revealed that she harvested a silky silfaka lemur&#x27;s brain fluid as one of the steps to achieving world domination. She later kills her past self created in &quot;The Time Paradox&quot;, creating a paradox. Opal is later killed by Oro Shaydova, the leader of fairy soldiers killed in the battle of Taillte.

===Mulch Diggums===

Mulch is a kleptomaniac, criminal dwarf who has been involved in crime for four centuries. When considered with the average dwarf lifespan, he is not that old. He once was a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (humans) suited him much better. Because he has stolen from Mud Men, Mulch no longer has the significant magic powers of the usual fairy, but he has retained some aspect of the gift of tongues as &quot;all tongues are based on Gnommish if you trace them back far enough&quot;, and has even shown his ability to speak &#x27;American dog&#x27; in &quot;The Arctic Incident&quot;. He insists that humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that he is simply taking them back or repossessing the items. In the early books, he assisted the LEP against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. Eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with the Fairy People on many adventures, acting as an LEP helper at the beginning of &quot;The Time Paradox&quot;.

===Julius Root===
Julius Root commanded the LEPrecon and was in charge of all activities related to the tracking of those who leave fairy civilization, to prevent them making contact with humans. Known for his ruddy face (hence his nickname, &quot;Beetroot&quot;) and extremely short temper, he led the LEPrecon on missions until Koboi killed him with an explosive in &quot;The Opal Deception&quot; and framed Holly Short. He usually despised Holly&#x27;s disregard for rules and orders. However, Root also seems to have been a lot like Holly Short when he was younger; a book states that Holly Short had recently beat the speed record that had been set 80 years prior by Julius Root. Julius Root hates when Foaly called him by his first name. Julius Root also had a brother, Turnball Root, the main antagonist in &quot;The Atlantis Complex&quot;.

===Briar Cudgeon===
A minor antagonist in the first novel, Cudgeon was an ex-LEP lieutenant who was humiliated by Commander Julius Root and had the misfortune of having a terrible-looking face, the result of illegal mind-boosting liquid colliding with tranquilizer Julius Root used in the first novel. Looking for revenge, Cudgeon teams up with Opal Koboi in &quot;The Arctic Incident&quot;. Their plan suddenly goes wrong when LEP technical consultant Foaly inserts a video in Koboi Laboratories to expose Briar Cudgeon&#x27;s confessions to treachery to Opal. Enraged by this, Opal attacks Cudgeon, and in the struggle, they smash into a pipeline containing reignited plasma, which violently fries Cudgeon to death, and gruesomely incapacitates Opal.

==Themes==
Colfer has said in interviews that the series is about Artemis growing up. Themes of greed, trust, and the difference between good and evil are also present in the books. Colfer wanted to end the series with a simple choice between being kind without reward or being unkind for a reward.

==Critical reception==
Colfer summed up the first book as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; with fairies.&quot; Critics call the series &quot;the new &quot;Harry Potter&quot;,&quot; although Colfer stated in 2001 that he disagreed. Kate Kellaway of &quot;The Observer&quot; called the first book &quot;a smart, amusing one-off. It flashes with hi-tech invention – as if Colfer were as much an inspired as a writer&quot;. Time magazine said of the book, &quot;&quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; is pacy, playful, and very funny, an inventive mix of myth and modernity, magic and crime&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; said that &quot;Colfer has done enormously, explosively well&quot; in writing a book that could be accurately described as &quot;&quot;Die Hard&quot; with fairies&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; gave a favorable review to &quot;The Atlantis Complex&quot;, the seventh book in the series, but noted &quot;it is also clearly a prelude to the grand finale.&quot;

&quot;The Last Guardian&quot;, the eighth and final novel of the series, received favorable reviews from &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, also winning the 2012 Irish Book Award in the &quot;Irish Children&#x27;s Book – Senior&quot; category.

In 2010 &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; was selected by readers as the favorite Puffin Books title of all time, which Colfer described as his &quot;proudest professional moment.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

In 2001 plans were announced for a film adaptation of the series. Miramax Films was named as purchasing the film rights with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct. In 2003 Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year but expressed skepticism over whether or not this would come to pass, though Colfer revealed the film was in pre-production. The film remained in development and was assumed to be in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie, with Saoirse Ronan attached to portray Holly Short.

In July 2013, Walt Disney Pictures announced that an &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; film covering the events of the first and second novels of the series would be produced by Disney and The Weinstein Company, with the screenplay by Michael Goldenberg. Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal signed onto the project as executive producers.

In September 2015, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Kenneth Branagh had been hired to direct the film for Disney, with Irish playwright Conor McPherson as screenwriter and Judy Hofflund as an executive producer. Eoin Colfer confirmed this in a video to Artemis Fowl Confidential, and spoke with RTE Radio 1 about meeting Branagh several times to discuss this prior to the announcement. On 12 September 2017, Disney announced that the film adaptation would be released on 9 August 2019. It was also announced to be based on the first two books in the series.

It was announced on 11 October 2017 that Disney removed Harvey Weinstein as the producer of the film as well as terminating its production with The Weinstein Company following a sexual misconduct controversy involving Weinstein. On 20 December 2017, it was announced that Irish newcomer Ferdia Shaw had been cast as Artemis Fowl II, alongside Judi Dench as Commander Root, Josh Gad as Mulch Diggums, Lara McDonnell as Captain Holly Short, and Nonso Anozie as Butler. Principal photography began in March 2018 with filming in England, Northern Ireland, and Ho Chi Minh City.

In May 2019, the film&#x27;s originally scheduled release date of 9 August 2019 was delayed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to 29 May 2020, as part of a change to their release schedule, while Colin Farrell was announced to be portraying Artemis Fowl I. The film was pulled completely on 3 April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and instead debuted on Disney+, 12 June 2020.

Upon the film&#x27;s release, the film was criticised for the removal of the character arcs of both Artemis Fowl II and Holly Short from the book series in the film, with Fowl switched from antagonist to protagonist, and Short being relegated from protagonist to supporting character. McDonnell&#x27;s casting was also criticised as whitewashing due to Short being physically described in the book series as having nut-brown skin of a coffee complexion. The casting of Nonso Anozie as Butler was also criticised for several reasons: that the character is described as Eurasian who can pass as Japanese and Russian in the book series, and that the character&#x27;s physical description of terrifying anyone in his presence, combined with his backstory of his family having served the Fowl family for centuries and Anozie&#x27;s casting, embodies several stereotypes of African Americans, in particular the &quot;scary black man&quot; and &quot;black servant&quot; tropes.

On 26 May 2023, the film was removed from Disney+ as part of a Disney+ and Hulu purge.

Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet ({{IPA|fr|katʁin də vivɔn maʁkiz də ʁɑ̃bujɛ}}; 1588 – 2 December 1665), known as Madame de Rambouillet ({{IPA|fr|madam də ʁɑ̃bujɛ}}), was a society hostess and a major figure in the literary history of 17th-century France.
{{French literature sidebar}}

==Life==
Born in Rome, she was the daughter and heiress of Jean de Vivonne, marquis of Pisani, and Giulia Savelli, who belonged to a noble Roman family. 
She was married at the age of twelve to Charles d&#x27;Angennes, &quot;vidame du Mans&quot;, and in 1612, &quot;marquis de Rambouillet&quot;. They had seven children, two sons and five daughters. The young and witty marquise found the coarseness and intrigues of the French court little to her taste and, in 1620, she began to gather around her the circle that gave its renown to her salon. She and her husband had taken residence in Paris at the Hôtel Pisani, later renamed &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot;, and which she restored between 1618 and 1620. It was situated &quot;rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre&quot;, between the Louvre and the Tuileries. The former &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot;, which belonged to the d&#x27;Angennes family, was located rue Saint-Honoré and was sold in 1602 by her father-in-law, Nicolas d&#x27;Angennes. In 1624, it was bought by Cardinal Richelieu who had it demolished, and who built on its site his &quot;Palais Cardinal&quot;, future Palais Royal.

Madame de Rambouillet arranged the former &quot;Hôtel Pisani&quot; for the purpose of receiving her guests, and devised suites of small rooms where guests could move around and find more privacy than in the large reception rooms. She received her visitors in the &quot;chambre bleue&quot;, a salon painted in blue and with blue heavy brocade wall hangings. The &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot; maintained its importance as a literary &quot;salon&quot; until the mid-17th century: the beginning of its decline was in 1645, year of the marriage of Julie and of the death of the 30-year-old &quot;marquis de Pisani&quot;, son of the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet; it continued in 1648, which saw the beginning of the Fronde and the death of Vincent Voiture, &quot;l&#x27;âme du rond&quot; (&quot;the soul of the circle&quot;), and was accelerated in 1652, at the death of the marquis de Rambouillet. Almost all major personages of the French aristocracy and literature of the time frequented it, and its reputation was at its height in the second quarter of the century. Occasionally, in spring and summer, the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet would entertain the &quot;habitués&quot; of their Parisian residence in the château de Rambouillet and its park.

Her success as a literary hostess (the term &quot;salonnière&quot; did not appear before the 19th century) has many explanations. Her natural abilities had been carefully trained. The marquise had a genuine kindness and a lack of prejudice that enabled her to entertain princes and princesses of the blood royal and literary men with the same grace, whilst among her intimate friends was the actress Angélique Paulet. The respect paid to ability in the salon effected a great advancement in the position of French men of letters. Moreover, the almost uniform excellence of the memoirs and letters of 17th century French men and women may be traced largely to the development of conversation as a fine art at the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot;, and the consequent establishment of a standard of clear and adequate expression. Mme de Rambouillet was known as the &quot;incomparable Arthénice&quot;, the name being an anagram for &quot;Catherine&quot;, devised by François de Malherbe and Racan.

Among the more noteworthy episodes in the history of the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot; are the literary quarrel between the &quot;Uranistes&quot; and the &quot;Jobelins&quot; - respective partisans of two famous sonnets, the &quot;Sonnet d&#x27;Uranie&quot;, by Vincent Voiture, and the &quot;Sonnet de Job&quot;, by Isaac de Benserade - and the composition by almost all the great poets of the day of the &quot;Guirlande de Julie&quot;, a collection of forty-one madrigals, each on the theme of a flower, offered in 1641 to Julie d&#x27;Angennes by Charles de Sainte Maure, who had been wooing her for ten years when he conceived the idea of the handsome manuscript, but whom she kept waiting four more years. Julie herself, the Hôtel de Rambouillet &quot;Princesse Julie&quot;, was responsible for a good deal of the preciosity for which the &quot;Précieuses&quot; were later ridiculed by Molière.

The &quot;Précieuses&quot;, who are usually associated with Molière&#x27;s avowed caricatures and with the extravagances of Mlle de Scudéry, but a name Madame de Sévigné herself was proud to bear, insisted on a ceremonious gallantry from their suitors and friends, though it seems from the account given by Tallemant des Réaux that mild practical jokes took place at the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot;. They especially favoured an elaborate and quintessenced kind of colloquial and literary expression, imitated from Giambattista Marini and Luís de Góngora y Argote, then fashionable throughout Europe.

Molière&#x27;s immortal &quot;Précieuses ridicules&quot; was no doubt directly levelled not at the &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot; itself, but at the numerous coteries which in the course of years had sprung up in imitation of it. The satire affected the originators as well as the imitators, the former more closely perhaps than they perceived. The &quot;Hôtel de Rambouillet&quot; remained in existence until the death of its hostess, although the troubles of the Fronde diminished its influence.

The chief original authorities respecting Madame de Rambouillet and her set are Tallemant des Réaux in his &quot;Historiettes&quot;, and Antoine Baudeau de Somaize in his &quot;Grand Dictionnaire des Précieuses&quot; (1660).

Among the &quot;habitués&quot; of Madame de Rambouillet&#x27;s &quot;chambre bleue&quot; were:

* Jean-Louis Guez de Balzac
* &quot;Le Grand Condé&quot;
* Anne Geneviève de Bourbon, duchesse de Longueville
* Anne Marie Louise d&#x27;Orléans, Duchesse de Montpensier, &quot;La Grande Mademoiselle

In homage to the &quot;Marquise de Rambouillet&quot;, the city of Rambouillet has named its Junior High School &quot;Collège Catherine de Vivonne&quot;.

<text>Eoin Colfer (; born 14 May 1965) is an Irish author of children&#x27;s books. He worked as a primary school teacher before he became a full-time writer. He is best known for being the author of the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; series. In September 2008, Colfer was commissioned to write the sixth installment of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series, titled &quot;And Another Thing ...&quot;, which was published in October 2009. In October 2016, in a contract with Marvel Comics, he released &quot;Iron Man: The Gauntlet&quot;. He served as Laureate na nÓg (Ireland&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Laureate) between 2014 and 2016.

==Biography==
Eoin Colfer was born in Wexford, Ireland. He graduated from the University of Dublin with a bachelor’s degree in Education. Soon after graduating, Colfer spent four years working in Saudi Arabia, Italy and Tunisia. His travels throughout Europe, as well as his Irish heritage, serve as a basis for many of his earlier stories. He attained worldwide recognition in 2001, when the first &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. Since then, several others of his works have become bestsellers as well. Among his other popular works are &quot;Half Moon Investigations&quot;, &quot;The Wish List&quot;, &quot;The Supernaturalist&quot;, and a series of Eoin Colfer&#x27;s Legends. In January 2008, Colfer published a book titled &quot;Airman&quot;, another best-seller. To date, more than half of his books have reached the &quot;New York Times&quot; list at least once. His books have also received many awards, including the British Children’s Book of the Year, The Irish Book Awards Children’s Book of the Year and The German Children’s Book of the Year.

===Graphic novels===
In 2015, it was announced that Colfer was working on an adult graphic novel called &quot;Illegal&quot; with Andrew Donkin and Giovanni Rigano, the team behind the &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; graphic novels. The same team released their second young adult graphic novel called &quot;Global&quot; on 11 April 2023.

===Film and TV adaptations===
In April 2014, principal photography began on a new Irish feature film &quot;Poison Pen&quot;, the first screenplay from Colfer. The film, a romantic comedy, was filmed on location in Ireland over the next three weeks by the participants on the Filmbase/Staffordshire University MSc in Digital Feature Film Production. The film premiered at the 26th Galway Film Fleadh on 11 July 2014. The film is an eco-friendly production. John Gormley, the former Green Party Minister, was appointed as a Green Production Manager for the production, with a view to minimising the carbon footprint and environmental impact of the film.

On 1 September 2015, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Kenneth Branagh had been hired to direct &quot;Artemis Fowl&quot; for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, with Irish playwright Conor McPherson as screenwriter and Judy Hofflund and Branagh as producers. Colfer confirmed this in a video to Artemis Fowl Confidential, and spoke with RTE Radio 1 about meeting Branagh several times to discuss the film prior to the announcement. The film was originally scheduled for release on 9 August 2019 but on 7 May 2019 it was delayed to 29 May 2020. The film was pulled on 3 April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and debuted on Disney+ on 12 June 2020 instead of a theatrical release, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

On August 28, 2020, Colfer’s novel &quot;Highfire&quot; was expected to be adapted into a television series with Nicolas Cage voicing a character and producing the series for Prime Video, until July 7, 2022, the series was moved to Paramount+.

<text>Brussels Airport is the main international airport of Belgium. It is located in the municipality of Zaventem in Flemish Brabant, northeast of Brussels. Also informally known as Brussels-National Airport or Brussels-Zaventem Airport, Brussels Airport handled more than 26 million passengers in 2019, making it the 26th busiest airport in Europe. It is home to around 260 companies, together directly employing 20,000 people and serves as the home base for Brussels Airlines and TUI fly Belgium. BRU covers 1,245 hectares (3,076 acres) and contains three runways.

The company operating the airport is known as The Brussels Airport Company N.V./S.A.; before 19 October 2006, the name was BIAC (Brussels International Airport Company), which was created by Belgian law through a merger of BATC with the ground operations departments of the RLW/RVA. Since 2011, the airport has been owned by the Toronto-based Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan (39%), Macquarie Group (Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund I and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund III) (36%) and the Belgian State (25%).

On 22 March 2016, the airport&#x27;s departures hall was severely damaged by two terrorist bomb blasts. The airport was closed until 3 April 2016, when it was reopened with temporary facilities at less than 20% of its previous capacity. It has since returned to full operations, with a record of 90,000 passengers on 29 July 2016.

==History==

===Early years===
The origins of Brussels Airport at Zaventem date back to 1940, when the German occupying force claimed of agricultural fields reserved as a back-up airfield (&quot;Steenokkerzeel&quot;). There the Luftwaffe established Fliegerhorst Melsbroek and constructed three runways in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airport buildings were constructed in the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as Melsbroek (in Dutch) (or &quot;Fliegerhorst Melsbroek&quot; in German). There is an urban legend that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it–the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.

After the liberation on 3 September 1944, the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the old civilian airport in Haren became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new terminal building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the lengths of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased, to and respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at . The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, the prince regent, on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956, many more buildings and facilities were erected, mostly on the Melsbroek side of the site.

In 1955, a railway line from Brussels city centre to the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by King Baudouin on 15 May 1955.

In 1956, a new runway was constructed, 07R/25L, which almost runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to . In April 1956, the Belgian government decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair (Expo 58). The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated on 5 July 1958, just in time for the 1958 World’s Fair. The buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the Belgian Air Force (15th Air Transport Wing), and this is still known as Melsbroek Airfield. Both Zaventem Airport and Melsbroek Air Base, the military airfield, share the same runways.

===Development since the 1960s===
During the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new cargo terminal was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil surrounding the demise of the national airline Sabena, a new pier was opened.

In 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by Airports Council International / International Air Transport Association (ACI/IATA), based on a survey of over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continued to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. A direct train link with Leuven and Liège was opened on 12 December 2005.

In 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006. In 2008, the airport served 18.5 million passengers, which was an increase of 3.7% over the previous year.

Sabena&#x27;s demise meant a sharp fall in passenger traffic, a blow from which the airport only slowly recovered. The airport&#x27;s future is threatened by disagreement between the governments of Flanders and the Brussels Capital Region concerning night-time air traffic routes.

In March 2009, the old mechanical Flight information display systems were replaced by electronic ones. In September 2009, CEO Wilfried Van Assche resigned. One of the (unofficial) reasons was the delay in the construction of the low-cost terminal and the possible lawsuit by 52 airlines active at Brussels Airport, on the grounds of tax discrimination. It was Van Assche who started expanding the Long-Haul network (Jet Airways, Hainan Airlines, Etihad Airways and US Airways) at Brussels Airport. In February 2010 Arnaud Feist was appointed CEO. The Chairman of the Board is .

On 18 February 2013, in the 2013 Belgium diamond heist, eight men armed with automatic weapons and dressed in police uniforms seized 120 small parcels containing an estimated US$50 million worth of diamonds from a Helvetic Airways Fokker 100 passenger plane loaded with passengers preparing for departure to Zürich. The men drove two vehicles through a hole they had cut in the airport perimeter fence to Flight LX789, which had just been loaded with diamonds from a Brink&#x27;s armored van from Antwerp. They carried out the operation within five minutes with no injuries and without firing a shot.

=== 2016 Brussels bombings ===

On 22 March 2016, two explosions took place in Brussels Airport at 07:58 local time. One occurred near the American Airlines and Brussels Airlines check-in desks and the other next to a Starbucks coffee shop. A third bomb was found in the airport and detonated in a controlled explosion. The airport was closed after the attacks until 3 April, when it reopened with temporary facilities at less than 20% of its previous passenger capacity. Flights bound to Brussels Airport were either canceled or diverted to nearby airports such as Brussels South Charleroi Airport, Ostend–Bruges International Airport, and Schiphol. At 09:11 CET, an explosion took place at Maelbeek/Maalbeek metro station. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attacks as an act of revenge against Belgium for participation in the ongoing Military intervention against ISIL.

==Facilities==


Brussels Airport uses a one terminal concept, meaning that all the facilities are located under a single roof. The terminal building consists of several levels. The railway station is located on −1, buses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3. Levels 2 and 3 are connected to the airport&#x27;s two piers (A and B).

===Pier A===
The newest pier in Brussels airport was pier A, opened on 15 May 2002. This pier was destined to support flights from and to the Schengen countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all Brussels Airlines flights to African destinations are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72. Later, Brussels Airlines&#x27; daily flight to New York was also moved here from pier B.

Until 26 March 2015, Pier A was connected to the main building via a tunnel under the apron. Each pier used to have its own security zone, so transfer between the piers involved a security check, which for practical purposes made it to be two terminals. This tunnel was replaced by the &quot;Connector&quot;, a new building that links both piers above ground and allows passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building provides arriving passengers with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit. Furthermore, border control has been relocated behind the 25-lane screening platform (Europe&#x27;s largest) inside the Connector which means that changing planes no longer requires a security check.

===Pier B===
Pier B is the oldest pier still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flights outside the Schengen Area. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the baggage claim area.

===Planned===

====Pier A West====
Pier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-Schengen countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works would be delayed. However, in November 2015, Brussels Airport announced a major 550 million euro investment and pointed out that within this investment the extension of the pier is included.

====Low-cost pier====
Just as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new low-cost pier is currently on hold. It will be built roughly where the old south pier used to be. At present, several low-cost airlines including Ryanair and Wizz Air fly to Brussels-South Charleroi Airport, away from Brussels. In autumn 2013, low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines announced it would end its flights between Brussels Airport and Turkey. The service between Brussels and Istanbul–Sabiha Gökçen would relocate to Brussels-South Charleroi Airport. However, Turkish Airlines announced on 26 November 2013 it would offer one daily flight on the same route, starting one month after Pegasus terminated its operations at the airport. One day later, Ryanair announced the opening of a second Belgian base at Brussels Airport, giving a boost to low-cost traffic at Brussels Airport. Ryanair announced on 27 November 10 new routes from Brussels Airport, although Brussels-South Charleroi Airport will remain the low-cost carrier&#x27;s primary Belgian base.

===Services===
Drinking water fountains are found all over the airport. After security check-in, water bottles are available for a small fee.

Shops, bars and restaurants are scattered throughout the building. A few facilities are located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, Relay stores and a coffee shop. But most of the facilities can only be accessed after Security control –and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A. The airport also features places of worship (for Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Orthodox Christians and Protestants), as well as a place for meditation for humanists. The airport provides meeting facilities and can host congresses up to 600 participants, either in the Regus Skyport Meeting Center or in the Sheraton Brussels Airport Hotel. The latter is the only hotel located on the airport grounds, opposite the terminal. Shuttle services are provided to 14 nearby hotels.

All passengers now have unlimited free Wi-Fi access.

===Other facilities===
Several airlines have or had its head offices at the grounds of Brussels Airport. Brussels Airlines has its corporate head office in the b.house, Airport Building 26, located in Diegem, Machelen. European Air Transport had its head office in Building 4–5, in Zaventem. Before Sabena went out of business, its head office was in the Sabena House on the grounds of Brussels Airport. When it existed, Virgin Express had its head office in Building 116 in Zaventem. SN Brussels, which formed in 2002, had its head office in Airport Building 117 in Zaventem when it existed. Prior to its disestablishment, Sobelair had its head office in Building 45 in Zaventem. CityBird was based in building 117D. The cargo airline Cargo B Airlines had its head office in the Brucarco Building 706 in Zaventem.

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Brussels:


===Cargo===
==Statistics==

===Traffic===

* The relapse in 2001 and 2002 is due to the combined effects of the September 11 attacks and the collapse of then home carrier Sabena in the final quarter of 2001. 
* The cargo relapse in 2008 and 2009 is due to the combined effects of the Financial crisis of 2007–08, also affecting passenger volumes in 2009, and the relocation of DHL Aviation to Leipzig/Halle Airport. DHL departed after the Belgian government decided they could not operate more cargo flights at night because of noise for the people living in the surrounding area.
* The 2016 decrease in passenger numbers and aircraft movements results from the 2016 Brussels bombings which caused the airport to close for 11 days before reopening with severely reduced capacity.

===Routes===


==Ground transportation==

===Road===

Brussels Airport can be reached by car via the A201, which is directly connected to the Brussels Ring (R0) orbital motorway. From there, the main motorways of Belgium can directly be accessed. Private partners provide three car parks at the airport, offering in total 10,600 parking spaces. Shell operates a self-service filling station near the exit of the airport complex.

Several car rental services are located in the airport as well. Europcar, Hertz, Sixt and Thrifty all operate at Brussels Airport. DriveNow also offers a car-sharing service at Brussels Airport located at P3 Holiday Parking, and Zipcar has parking spaces. Taxi2Share provides sharing cab service from the airport.

De Lijn provides bus transportation to and from various cities in Flanders from platforms A and B (via Brucargo). The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company (STIB/MIVB) provides transportation into Brussels city centre from Schuman railway station, Brussels-Luxembourg railway station and Trône/Troon metro station via line 12 from platform C. Platform E is used by the Hotel Shuttles, offering shuttle services to several hotels near the area.

Taxis are permanently available in front of the arrivals hall. Licensed taxis can be recognized by the blue and yellow emblem.

===Rail===

Brussels Airport-Zaventem railway station is located under the airport building at level −1. The train station has direct services to Antwerp, Brussels, De Panne, Ghent, Hasselt, Landen, Leuven, Mechelen, Nivelles and Quévy. At least four trains per hour serve the most used link to Brussels-South railway station, where international connections are offered by Eurostar (to Amsterdam, Avignon, Cologne, Essen, Lille, London, Marseille, Paris and Valence), ICE (to Cologne and Frankfurt), and Eurocity (to Basel, Bern, Chur, Luxembourg and Zürich).

A direct train link with Leuven was opened on 12 December 2005. A direct link with Antwerp and Mechelen via the so-called Diabolo line was opened for public service on 10 June 2012. The Diabolo project is a public-private partnership. It has been decided that all rail passengers to Brussels Airport-Zaventem railway station pay a &quot;Diabolo supplement&quot; to finance the ongoing and planned work.

As of December 2014, a direct train link between Bruges and the airport will be offered, just as an Intercity service to Schiphol and Amsterdam.

Since the new Schuman-Josaphat tunnel has been finished, a new connection has been established to connect Brussels Airport directly to the stations of the European Quarter, being Brussels-Schuman and Brussels-Luxembourg. This brought the travel time between the airport and the European Quarter to 15 minutes. The National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB) announced the line to open as an hourly service. However, the line now sees a train every 30 minutes on weekdays.

===Tram===
In an attempt to alleviate the gridlock around Brussels, the Flemish regional transport company De Lijn started the Brabantnet project, which was then scheduled to be finished by 2020.
Three new light rail lines will be created, of which 2 will terminate at Brussels Airport:

* The Airport Tram, connecting Brussels Airport to Brussels-North railway station, but taking a different trajectory from the existing railway line;
* The Ring Tram, roughly following the northern side of the Brussels Ring and connecting several Brussels suburbs and Vilvoorde to the airport.

To speed up the process, testing started in August 2016 with a &quot;Ringtrambus&quot;, a bus rapid transit system developed by Belgian bus builder Van Hool, which requires less investment than a tram. The &quot;Ringtrambus&quot; started service on 28 July 2020, using fourteen 24-metre double-articulated buses. The initial half-hourly service is to be upgraded to quarter-hourly on 1 September 2020. Route 820 runs between Brussels Airport and the Brussels University Hospital in Jette, via Brucargo, the station and the centre of Vilvoorde, the Kassei neighbourhood, the employment area around the Medialaan, Strombeek and the Heysel/Heizel. This solution is presented as an in-between step until the tram line is finished.

The Airport Tram will be an extension of present Brussels tram lines 55 and 62, and will roughly follow the A201 motorway, but will need a large bridge to cross the Brussels Ring into the airport.
The present tram tracks end at the Eurocontrol headquarters, but the extension will lead from the Bourget Roundabout along the A12 into the airport. The new line will be a so-called &#x27;high frequency&#x27; line (comparable to Brussels tram lines 7 and 8) connecting the northern part of the city with the Business zone next to the airport and the airport itself.

===Bicycle===
Brussels Airport has a special separated road that provides access to the airport for bikers and pedestrians. There is also a special place to park bikes. Since 2019, the airport has a direct connection from the bicycle freeway Brussels–Leuven (&quot;Fietssnelweg F3&quot;). In 2016, merely 1% of employees were commuting by bike. In an effort to further increase this number, bicycle leasing was introduced to employees, and in 2020 almost 10% of the Brussels Airport employees signed up for this.

==Accidents and incidents==

*On 17 September 1946, a Sabena Douglas DC-3 went into a half roll and crashed into some hangars on takeoff because of loss of airspeed. One crewmember out of the seven occupants on board was killed.
*On 15 February 1961, Sabena Flight 548, a Boeing 707, crashed during approach on runway 20, killing all 72 people on board and one on the ground. This was the first fatal accident involving a Boeing 707, resulting in the death of the entire United States Figure Skating team on its way to the World Figure Skating Championships in Prague, Czechoslovakia, which the International Skating Union subsequently cancelled out of respect for the team.
*On 25 May 2008, Kalitta Air Flight 207, a Boeing 747-200F, overran the shorter runway 20, crashed into a field and split in three. Four of the five people on board received minor injuries.

<text>The Royal College of Art (RCA) is a public research university in London, United Kingdom, with campuses in South Kensington, Battersea and White City. It is the only entirely postgraduate art and design university in the United Kingdom. It offers postgraduate degrees in art and design to students from over 60 countries.

==History==

The RCA was founded in Somerset House in 1837 as the Government School of Design or Metropolitan School of Design. Richard Burchett became head of the school in 1852. In 1853 it was expanded and moved to Marlborough House, and then, in 1853 or 1857, to South Kensington, on the same site as the South Kensington Museum. It was renamed the Normal Training School of Art in 1857 and the National Art Training School in 1863. During the later 19th century it was primarily a teacher training college; pupils during this period included George Clausen, Christopher Dresser, Luke Fildes, Kate Greenaway and Gertrude Jekyll.

In September 1896 the school received the name Royal College of Art, and the emphasis of teaching there shifted to the practice of art and design. Teaching of graphic design, industrial design and product design began in the mid-twentieth century. The school expanded further in the 1960s, and in 1967 it received a royal charter (amended in 2021) which gave it the power to grant its own degrees.

In July 2020, the Royal College of Art launched its first-ever online graduate exhibition, RCA2020.

==Campuses==

The RCA today has three campuses located in South Kensington, Battersea and White City.

The Darwin Building in Kensington Gore, South Kensington, was completed 1960–1963. It is a short distance from the RCA&#x27;s home 1896–1967 in the Henry Cole Building, now part of the V&amp;A Museum. The Darwin Building was designed by a team of RCA staff members, H. T. Cadbury-Brown, Hugh Casson and Robert Goodden, and since 2001 has been a Grade II listed building. It is named after painter Sir Robert Vere Darwin, known as Robin Darwin, who was the rector at the time the building was commissioned. Although there was modest development into the mews behind the Darwin Building, the restricted site meant further expansion had to be in another part of London.

In 1991 the sculpture department moved to a converted factory in Battersea. In the early 2000s the college conceived a substantial extension on the site, with a minibus service linking it to Kensington. After a redevelopment by Wright &amp; Wright (budget £4.3m, floor area 2,500 sq m), the Sculpture Building opened in Battersea in January 2009. In 2018 the RCA was granted planning permission to redevelop the Sculpture building into a new Arts &amp; Humanities building, designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, with work planned for completion in late 2021.

A masterplan was commissioned from Haworth Tompkins and phase one of their three-phase design was completed with the opening of the Sackler Building on 19 November 2009, to house the painting department. Its name commemorates a major gift by The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation.
The Dyson Building, named in honour of James Dyson, whose charity donated £5m towards the £21m cost, was opened on 24 September 2012. It houses printmaking and photography, and contains an innovation wing where start-up designers can launch their businesses. The Woo Building was opened on 30 September 2015, completing the Battersea project. It is named in honour of Sir Po-Shing and Lady Helen Woo, who have funded scholarships at the RCA since the 1990s. It accommodates the Ceramics &amp; Glass and Jewellery &amp; Metal programmes. The building&#x27;s anodised aluminium gates were designed by alumnus Max Lamb.

In 2017 RCA White City became the third RCA campus, co-located with the BBC Media Village and accommodating the School of Communication, Animation and Digital Direction and Communication Design in buildings designed by Allies and Morrison.

==Courses==
The RCA offers a Graduate Diploma pre-masters conversion programme, MA, MRes, MPhil and PhD degrees in twenty-eight subject areas, divided into four schools: architecture, arts &amp; humanities, communication, and design. The history of design programme is in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum; there are two double MA/MSc programmes with Imperial College London.

In addition to formal qualifications the RCA also offers Summer school and Executive education courses throughout the year. English for academic purposes (EAP) courses are offered to applicants who need to improve their academic English ability to meet the college&#x27;s entry requirements.

In early 2019, the RCA announced the launch of its new GenerationRCA programme. GenerationRCA -among other initiatives- will also &quot;inject science disciplines into the mix of creative disciplines traditionally on offer.&quot; The new programmes will include Environmental Architecture and Digital Direction; with future programmes centred on nano and soft robotics, computer science, and machine learning, material science and the circular economy.

In 2024, the RCA was placed first in the art and design subject area in the QS World University Rankings published by Quacquarelli Symonds for the tenth year in a row, with an overall score of 98.5/100.
For the second consecutive year the RCA was also ranked first place in the History of Art category, which incorporates programmes teaching the history of design.

In August 2015 it was ranked first on a list of master&#x27;s courses in fashion by Business of Fashion, a fashion website.

In April 2011 the RCA was ranked first on a list of UK graduate art schools compiled by &quot;Modern Painters&quot; magazine from a survey of professionals in the art world.

In the Research Assessment Exercise of December 2008, 40% of the research output of the school received the highest (4* or &quot;world-leading&quot;) assessment, the third-highest rating in the art and design subject area; over all subject areas only about fifty institutions received a higher rating.

==Alumni==

The Royal College of Art and its predecessor schools have numerous notable alumni.

Among those who studied in the RCA predecessor bodies in the nineteenth century were Sir George Clausen, Christopher Dresser, Sir Luke Fildes, Kate Greenaway, Gertrude Jekyll and Edwin Lutyens.
Alumni from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries include the sculptors Jean Gibson, Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, painters Frank Auerbach, Sir Peter Blake, Frank Bowling, David Hockney, Bridget Riley, Gavin Turk and Charles Tunnicliffe, artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin and R. B. Kitaj, fashion designers Ossie Clark and Zandra Rhodes, industrial designers James Dyson, and David Mellor, film directors Tony and Ridley Scott, writer Travis Jeppesen, designers Thomas Heatherwick and architect Sir David Adjaye, prominent member of the suffragette movement Sylvia Pankhurst, the musician Ian Dury, sound artist Janek Schaefer, and the actor Alan Rickman. The artist and graduate Gerald Holtom designed the CND symbol in 1958, which has become a nearly universal peace symbol.

The Royal College of Art Society amalgamated with OSARCA (the Old Students Association of the RCA 1912) for the benefit of graduates and associates of the Royal College of Art.

==Faculty==

Academic and research staff include:


On February 25, 2021, Virgil Abloh joined staff as a Visiting Professor &quot;to reinforce the importance of education and hands on mentorship of future generations.&quot;

==Awards and prizes==
The Royal College of Art has several awards and prizes which it confers on its graduating students. These include the Sheila Robinson Drawing Prize.

<text>The Corps of Royal Engineers, usually called the Royal Engineers (RE), and commonly known as the &quot;Sappers&quot;, is the engineering arm of the British Army. It provides military engineering and other technical support to the British Armed Forces and is headed by the Chief Royal Engineer. The Corps Headquarters and the Royal School of Military Engineering are in Chatham in Kent, England. The corps is divided into several regiments, barracked at various places in the United Kingdom and around the world.

==History==
The Royal Engineers trace their origins back to the military engineers brought to England by William the Conqueror, specifically Bishop Gundulf of Rochester Cathedral, and claim over 900 years of unbroken service to the crown. Engineers have always served in the armies of the Crown; however, the origins of the modern corps, along with those of the Royal Artillery, lie in the Board of Ordnance established in the 15th century.

In Woolwich in 1716, the Board formed the Royal Regiment of Artillery and established a &quot;Corps of Engineers&quot;, consisting entirely of commissioned officers. The manual work was done by the &quot;Artificer Companies&quot;, made up of contracted civilian artisans and labourers. In 1772, a &quot;Soldier Artificer Company&quot; was established for service in Gibraltar, the first instance of non-commissioned military engineers. In 1787, the Corps of Engineers was granted the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix, and adopted its current name; in the same year, a &quot;Corps of Royal Military Artificers&quot; was formed, consisting of non-commissioned officers and privates, to be led by the Royal Engineers. Ten years later, the Gibraltar company (which had remained separate) was absorbed, and in 1812 the unit&#x27;s name was changed to the &quot;Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners&quot;.

The Corps has no battle honours. In 1832, the regimental motto, &quot;Ubique&quot; &amp; &quot;Quo Fas Et Gloria Ducunt&quot; (&quot;Everywhere&quot; &amp; &quot;Where Right And Glory Lead&quot;; in Latin &quot;fas&quot; implies &quot;sacred duty&quot;) was granted. The motto signified that the Corps had seen action in all the major conflicts of the British Army and almost all of the minor ones as well.

In 1855, the Board of Ordnance was abolished, and authority over the Royal Engineers, Royal Sappers and Miners and Royal Artillery was transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, thus uniting them with the rest of the Army. The following year, the Royal Engineers and Royal Sappers and Miners became a unified corps as the &quot;Corps of Royal Engineers&quot;, and their headquarters were moved from the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, to Chatham, Kent.

The re-organisation of the British military that began in the mid-Nineteenth Century and stretched over several decades included the reconstitution of the Militia, the raising of the Volunteer Force, and the ever-closer organisation of the part-time forces with the regular army. The old Militia had been an infantry force, other than the occasional employment of Militiamen to man artillery defences and other roles on an emergency basis. This changed in 1861, with the conversion of some units to artillery roles. Militia and Volunteer Engineering companies were also created, beginning with the conversion of the militia of Anglesey and Monmouthshire to engineers in 1877. The Militia and Volunteer Force engineers supported the regular Royal Engineers in a variety of roles, including operating the boats required to tend the submarine mine defences that protected harbours in Britain and its empire. These included a submarine mining militia company that was authorised for Bermuda in 1892, but never raised, and the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers that wore Royal Engineers uniforms and replaced the regular Royal Engineers companies withdrawn from the Bermuda Garrison in 1928. The various part-time reserve forces were amalgamated into the Territorial Force in 1908, which was retitled the Territorial Army after the First World War, and the Army Reserve in 2014.

Units from the Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery were in Australia, even after Federation.

In 1911 the Corps formed its Air Battalion, the first flying unit of the British Armed Forces. The Air Battalion was the forerunner of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force.

The First World War saw a rapid transformation of the Royal Engineers as new technologies became ever more important in the conduct of warfare and engineers undertook an increasing range of roles. In the front line they designed and built fortifications, operated poison gas equipment, repaired guns and heavy equipment, and conducted underground warfare beneath enemy trenches. Support roles included the construction, maintenance and operation of railways, bridges, water supply and inland waterways, as well as telephone, wireless and other communications. As demands on the Corps increased, its manpower was expanded from a total (including reserves) of about 25,000 in August 1914, to 315,000 in 1918.

In 1915, in response to German mining of British trenches under the then static siege conditions of the First World War, the corps formed its own tunnelling companies. Manned by experienced coal miners from across the country, they operated with great success until 1917, when after the fixed positions broke, they built deep dugouts such as the Vampire dugout to protect troops from heavy shelling.

Before the Second World War, Royal Engineers recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 4 inches tall (5 feet 2 inches for the Mounted Branch). They initially enlisted for six years with the colours and a further six years with the reserve or four years and eight years. Unlike most corps and regiments, in which the upper age limit was 25, men could enlist in the Royal Engineers up to 35 years of age. They trained at the Royal Engineers Depot in Chatham or the Royal Engineer Mounted Depot at Aldershot.

During the 1980s, the Royal Engineers formed the vital component of at least three Engineer Brigades: 12 Engineer Brigade (Airfield Damage Repair); 29th Engineer Brigade; and 30th Engineer Brigade. After the Falklands War, 37 (FI) Engineer Regiment was active from August 1982 until 14 March 1985.

==Regimental museum==
The Royal Engineers Museum is in Gillingham in Kent.

==Major projects==
===British Columbia===

The Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, which was commanded by Colonel Richard Clement Moody, was responsible for the foundation and settlement of British Columbia as the Colony of British Columbia.

===Royal Albert Hall===

The Royal Albert Hall was designed by Captain Francis Fowke and Major-General Henry Y. D. Scott of the Royal Engineers and built by Lucas Brothers. The designers were heavily influenced by ancient amphitheatres, but had also been exposed to the ideas of Gottfried Semper while he was working at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

===Indian infrastructure===
Much of the British colonial era infrastructure of India, of which elements survive today, was created by engineers of the three presidencies&#x27; armies and the Royal Engineers. Lieutenant (later General Sir) Arthur Thomas Cotton (1803–99), Madras Engineers, was responsible for the design and construction of the great irrigation works on the river Cauvery, which watered the rice crops of Tanjore and Trichinopoly districts in the late 1820s. In 1838 he designed and built sea defences for Vizagapatam. He masterminded the Godavery Delta project where of land were irrigated and of land to the port of Cocanada was made navigable in the 1840s. Such regard for his lasting legacy was shown when in 1983, the Indian Government erected a statue in his memory at Dowleswaram.

Other irrigation and canal projects included the Ganges Canal, where Colonel Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff (1836–1916) acted as the Chief Engineer and made modifications to the original work. Among other engineers trained in India, Scott-Moncrieff went on to become Under Secretary of State Public Works, Egypt where he restored the Nile barrage and irrigation works of Lower Egypt.

===Rideau Canal===
The construction of the Rideau Canal was proposed shortly after the War of 1812, when there remained a persistent threat of attack by the United States on the British colony of Upper Canada. The initial purpose of the Rideau Canal was military, as it was intended to provide a secure supply and communications route between Montreal and the British naval base in Kingston, Ontario. Westward from Montreal, travel would proceed along the Ottawa River to Bytown (now Ottawa), then southwest via the canal to Kingston and out into Lake Ontario. The objective was to bypass the stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering New York State, a route which would have left British supply ships vulnerable to attack or a blockade of the St. Lawrence. Construction of the canal was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel John By of the Royal Engineers. Directed by him, Lieutenant William Denison, determined the strength for construction purposes of old growth timber in the vicinity of Bytown, findings commended by the Institution of Civil Engineers in England.

===Dover&#x27;s Western Heights===

The Western Heights of Dover are one of the most impressive fortifications in Britain. They comprise a series of forts, strong points and ditches, designed to protect the United Kingdom from invasion. They were created to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack. First given earthworks in 1779 against the planned invasion that year, the high ground west of Dover, England, now called Dover Western Heights, was properly fortified in 1804 when Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was instructed to modernise the existing defences. This was part of a huge programme of fortification in response to Napoleon&#x27;s planned invasion of the United Kingdom. To assist with the movement of troops between Dover Castle and the town defences Twiss made his case for building the Grand Shaft in the cliff:

&quot;... the new barracks. ... are little more than 300 yards horizontally from the beach. ... and about above high-water mark, but in order to communicate with them from the centre of town, on horseback the distance is nearly a mile and a half and to walk it about three-quarters of a mile, and all the roads unavoidably pass over ground more than above the barracks, besides the footpaths are so steep and chalky that a number of accidents will unavoidably happen during the wet weather and more especially after floods. I am therefore induced to recommend the construction of a shaft, with a triple staircase ... the chief objective of which is the convenience and safety of troops ... and may eventually be useful in sending reinforcements to troops or in affording them a secure retreat.&quot;

Twiss&#x27;s plan was approved and building went ahead. The shaft was to be in diameter, deep with a gallery connecting the bottom of the shaft to Snargate Street, and all for under an estimated £4000. The plan entailed building two brick-lined shafts, one inside the other. In the outer would be built a triple staircase, the inner acting as a light well with &quot;windows&quot; cut in its outer wall to illuminate the staircases. Apparently, by March 1805 only of the connecting gallery was left to dig and it is probable that the project was completed by 1807.

===Pentonville Prison===

Two Acts of Parliament allowed for the building of Pentonville Prison for the detention of convicts sentenced to imprisonment or awaiting transportation. Construction started on 10 April 1840 and was completed in 1842. The cost was £84,186 12s 2d. Captain (later Major General Sir) Joshua Jebb designed Pentonville Prison, introducing new concepts such as single cells with good heating, ventilation and sanitation.

===Boundary Commissions===
Although mapping by what became the Ordnance Survey was born out of military necessity it was soon realised that accurate maps could be also used for civil purposes. The lessons learnt from this first boundary commission were put to good use around the world where members of the Corps have determined boundaries on behalf of the British as well as foreign governments; some notable boundary commissions include:

*1839 – Canada-United States
*1858 – Canada-United States (Captain (later General Sir) John Hawkins RE)
*1856 and 1857 – Russo-Turkish (Lieutenant Colonel (later Sir) Edward Stanton RE)

Much of this work continues to this day. The reform of the voting franchise brought about by the Reform Act (1832), demanded that boundary commissions were set up. Lieutenants Dawson and Thomas Drummond (1797–1839), Royal Engineers, were employed to gather the statistical information upon which the Bill was founded, as well as determining the boundaries and districts of boroughs. It was said that the fate of numerous boroughs fell victim to the heliostat and the Drummond light, the instrument that Drummond invented whilst surveying in Ireland.

===Abney Level===
An Abney level is an instrument used in surveying which consists of a fixed sighting tube, a movable spirit level that is connected to a pointing arm, and a protractor scale. The Abney level is an easy to use, relatively inexpensive, and when used correctly an accurate surveying tool. The Abney level was invented by Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney (1843–1920) who was a Royal Engineer, an English astronomer and chemist best known for his pioneering of colour photography and colour vision. Abney invented this instrument under the employment of the Royal School of Military Engineering in Chatham, England, in the 1870s.

===H.M. Dockyards===
In 1873, Captain Henry Brandreth RE was appointed Director of the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, later the Admiralty Works Department. Following this appointment many Royal Engineer officers superintended engineering works at Royal Navy Dockyards in various parts of the world, including the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, home base for vessels of the North America and West Indies Station.

; Chatham Dockyard
Chatham, being the home of the Corps, meant that the Royal Engineers and the Dockyard had a close relationship since Captain Brandreth&#x27;s appointment. At the Chatham Dockyard, Captain Thomas Mould RE designed the iron roof trusses for the covered slips, 4, 5 and 6. Slip 7 was designed by Colonel Godfrey Greene RE on his move to the Corps from the Bengal Sappers &amp; Miners. In 1886 Major Henry Pilkington RE was appointed Superintendent of Engineering at the Dockyard, moving on to Director of Engineering at the Admiralty in 1890 and Engineer-in-Chief of Naval Loan Works, where he was responsible for the extension of all major Dockyards at home and abroad.

==Trades==

All members of the Royal Engineers are trained combat engineers and all sappers (privates) and non-commissioned officers also have another trade. These trades include: air conditioning fitter, electrician, general fitter, plant operator mechanic, plumber, bricklayer, plasterer / painter, carpenter &amp; joiner, fabricator, building materials technician, design draughtsman, electrical &amp; mechanical draughtsman, geographic support technician, survey engineer, armoured engineer, driver, engineer IT, engineer logistics specialist, amphibious engineer, bomb disposal specialist, diver or search specialist. They may also undertake the specialist selection and training to qualify as Commandos or Military Parachutists. Women are eligible for all Royal Engineer specialities.

==Units==
==The Royal School of Military Engineering==

The Royal School of Military Engineering (RSME) is the British Army&#x27;s Centre of Excellence for Military Engineering, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and counter terrorist search training. Located on several sites in Chatham, Kent, Camberley in Surrey and Bicester in Oxfordshire the Royal School of Military Engineering offers training facilities for the full range of Royal Engineer skills. The RSME was founded by Major (later General Sir) Charles Pasley, as the Royal Engineer Establishment in 1812. It was renamed the School of Military Engineering in 1868 and granted the &quot;Royal&quot; prefix in 1962.

==Corps&#x27; Ensign==
The Royal Engineers, Ports Section, operated harbours and ports for the army and used mainly specialised vessels such as tugs and dredgers. During the Second World War the Royal Engineers&#x27; Blue Ensign was flown from the Mulberry harbours.

==Bishop Gundulf, Rochester and King&#x27;s Engineers==
Bishop Gundulf, a monk from the Abbey of Bec in Normandy came to England in 1070 as Archbishop Lanfranc&#x27;s assistant at Canterbury. His talent for architecture had been spotted by King William I and was put to good use in Rochester, where he was sent as bishop in 1077. Almost immediately the King appointed him to supervise the construction of the White Tower, now part of the Tower of London in 1078. Under William Rufus he also undertook building work on Rochester Castle. Having served three kings of England and earning &quot;the favour of them all&quot;, Gundulf is accepted as the first &quot;King&#x27;s Engineer&quot;.

==Corps Band==

The Band of the Corps of the Royal Engineers is the official military band of the RE. The RE Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1880. It was recognised by Queen Victoria seven years later, with her command that they perform at Buckingham Palace for a banquet on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee. In 1916–1917, the band toured France and Belgium, giving over one hundred and fifty concerts in a journey of 1800 miles. The band continued its tour of Europe following the cessation of hostilities. In 1936, the band performed at the funeral of George V and played the following year for the coronation of George VI in 1937. The band appeared at the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953, and has since been called on to play at state occasions, military tattoos and military parades. It has notably performed during the opening ceremonies of the Channel Tunnel and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge.

==The Institution of Royal Engineers==
The Institution of Royal Engineers, the professional institution of the Corps of Royal Engineers, was established in 1875 and in 1923 it was granted its Royal Charter by King George V. The Institution is collocated with the Royal Engineers Museum, within the grounds of the Royal School of Military Engineering at Brompton in Chatham, Kent.

&quot;Royal Engineers Journal&quot; - published tri-annually and contains articles with a military engineering connection. The first &quot;Journal&quot; was published in August 1870. The idea for the publication was proposed at the Corps Meeting of May 1870 by Major R Harrison and seconded By Captain R Home, who became its first editor (The &quot;Journal&quot; eventually superseded the &quot;Professional Papers&quot;, which were started by Lieutenant WT Denison in 1837 and continued to be published until 1918).

The &quot;History of the Corps of Royal Engineers&quot; is currently in its 12th volume. The first two volumes were written by Major General Whitworth Porter and published in 1889.

&quot;The Sapper&quot; is published by the Royal Engineers Central Charitable Trust and is a bi-monthly magazine for all ranks.

==The Royal Engineers&#x27; Association==
The present Royal Engineers Association promotes and supports the Corps among members of the Association in the following ways:
*By fostering esprit de corps and a spirit of comradeship and service.
*By maintaining an awareness of Corps traditions.
*By acting as a link between serving and retired members of the Corps.
*To provide financial and other assistance to serving and former members of the Corps, their wives, widows and dependants who are in need through poverty.
*To make grants, within Association guidelines, to the Army Benevolent Fund and to other charities which further the objectives of the Association.

==Sport==
===Royal Engineers&#x27; Yacht Club===
The Royal Engineers&#x27; Yacht Club, which dates back to 1812, promotes the skill of watermanship in the Royal Engineers.

They have entered every Fastnet Race since the second in 1926, which they won sailing &quot;IIlex&quot;.

===Royal Engineers Amateur Football Club===
The club was founded in 1863, under the leadership of Major Francis Marindin. Sir Frederick Wall, who was the secretary of The Football Association 1895–1934, stated in his memoirs that the &quot;combination game&quot; was first used by the Royal Engineers A.F.C. in the early 1870s. Wall states that the &quot;Sappers moved in unison&quot; and showed the &quot;advantages of combination over the old style of individualism&quot;.

; FA Cup
The Engineers played in the first-ever FA Cup Final in 1872, losing 1–0 at Kennington Oval on 16 March 1872, to regular rivals Wanderers. They also lost the 1874 FA Cup Final, to Oxford University A.F.C.

Their greatest triumph was the 1874–75 FA Cup. In the final against Old Etonians, they drew 1–1 with a goal from Renny-Tailyour and went on to win the replay 2–0 with two further goals from Renny-Tailyour. Their last FA Cup Final appearance came in 1878, again losing to the Wanderers. They last participated in 1882–83 FA Cup, losing 6–2 in the fourth round to Old Carthusians F.C.

The Engineers&#x27; Depot Battalion won the FA Amateur Cup in 1908.

On 7 November 2012, the Royal Engineers played against the Wanderers in a remake of the 1872 FA Cup Final at The Oval. Unlike the actual final, the Engineers won, and by a large margin, 7–1 being the final score.

===Rugby===
The Army were represented in the very first international by two members of the Royal Engineers, both playing for England, Lieutenant Charles Arthur Crompton RE and Lieutenant Charles Sherrard RE.

==Related units==
Several Corps have been formed from the Royal Engineers.
*Royal Flying Corps (RFC) 1912 - Air Battalion Royal Engineers (formed 1911) was the precursor of the Royal Flying Corps which evolved into the Royal Air Force in 1918.
*Royal Corps of Signals (R Sigs) 1920 -The Telegraph Troop, founded in 1870, became the Telegraph Battalion Royal Engineers who then became the Royal Engineers Signals Service, which in turn became the independent Royal Corps of Signals in 1920.
*Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) 1942 - When REME was created in 1942, it was formed from personnel previously in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Royal Army Service Corps, Royal Signals and Royal Engineers. After the war, the responsibilities of REME were increased in stages so that, by 1968, it had taken over responsibility for the maintenance of all Royal Engineers equipment, except construction equipment.
*Royal Corps of Transport (RCT) 1965 - The Royal Engineers were responsible for railway and inland waterway transport, port operations and movement control until 1965, when these functions were transferred to the new Royal Corps of Transport. (See also Railway Operating Division.) The Royal Corps of Transport merged into the Royal Logistic Corps in 1993.
*Royal Logistic Corps (RLC) 1993 - In 1913, the Army Post Office Corps (formed in 1882) and the Royal Engineers Telegraph Reserve (formed in 1884) amalgamated to form the Royal Engineers (Postal Section) Special Reserve. In 1959 it was restyled Royal Engineers (Postal and Courier Communications) and added to the regular cadre of the British Army, it was renamed Royal Engineers (Postal and Courier Services) in 1979. On 1 August 1988 the IRA bombed an accommodation block at the Postal &amp; Courier Depot, Inglis Barracks, Mill Hill, London killing one lance corporal and injuring nine soldiers. The RE (PCS) became a Defence Agency known as the Defence Postal and Courier Service in 1992 and in the same year Postal &amp; Courier trained operators of the Women&#x27;s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) were re-cap badged as Royal Engineers. The Service was transferred to the Royal Logistic Corps on its formation in 1993. – see (British Forces Post Office).

===&quot;The Sapper VCs&quot;===
In 1998, HMSO published an account of the 55 British and Commonwealth &#x27;Sappers&#x27; who have been awarded the Victoria Cross. The book was written by Colonel GWA Napier, former Royal Engineers officer and a former director of the Royal Engineers Museum. The book defines a &#x27;Sapper&#x27; as any &quot;member of a British or Empire military engineer corps, whatever their rank, speciality or national allegiance&quot;, and is thus not confined to Royal Engineers.

===Memorials===
*Rochester Cathedral, Kent has major historical links with the corps and contains many memorials including stained glass, mosaics and plaques. The cathedral hosts services on the annual Corps Memorial Weekend and is supported by the corps on Remembrance Sunday.
*Royal Engineers First World War memorial at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre
*National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas, Staffordshire
*The memorial to the Royal Engineers at Arromanches, the site of the Mulberry Harbours during the Second World War

==Rivalry==
The Royal Engineers have a traditional rivalry with the Royal Artillery (the Gunners).

<text>A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only.

CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as self-governing cities, towns, and villages, for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, edge cities, colonias located along the Mexico–United States border, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. The boundaries of any CDP may change from decade to decade, and the Census Bureau may de-establish a CDP after a period of study, then re-establish it some decades later. Most unincorporated areas within the United States are not and have not been included in any CDP.

The boundaries of a CDP have no legal status and may not always correspond with the local understanding of the area or community with the same name. However, criteria established for the 2010 census require that a CDP name &quot;be one that is recognized and used in daily communication by the residents of the community&quot; (not &quot;a name developed solely for planning or other purposes&quot;) and recommend that a CDP&#x27;s boundaries be mapped based on the geographic extent associated with inhabitants&#x27; regular use of the named place. There is no provision, however, that this name recognition be unanimous for all residents, or that all residents use the community for which the CDP is named for services provided therein. There is no mandatory correlation between CDP names or boundaries and those established for other human purposes, such as post office names or zones, political precincts, or school districts.

The Census Bureau states that census-designated places are not considered incorporated places and that it includes only census-designated places in its city population list for Hawaii because that state has no incorporated cities. In addition, census city lists from 2007 included Arlington County, Virginia&#x27;s CDP in the list with the incorporated places, but since 2010, only the Urban Honolulu CDP, Hawaii, representing the historic core of Honolulu, Hawaii, is shown in the city and town estimates.

==History==
The Census Bureau reported data for some unincorporated places as early as the first census in 1790 (for example, Louisville, Kentucky, which was not legally incorporated in Kentucky until 1828), though usage continued to develop through the 1890 census, in which the census mixed unincorporated places with incorporated places in its products with &quot;town&quot; or &quot;village&quot; as its label. This made it confusing to determine which of the &quot;towns&quot; were or were not incorporated.

The 1900 through 1930 censuses did not report data for unincorporated places.

For the 1940 census, the Census Bureau compiled a separate report of unofficial, unincorporated communities of 500 or more people. The Census Bureau officially defined this category as &quot;unincorporated places&quot; in the 1950 census and used that term through the 1970 census. For the 1950 census, these types of places were identified only outside &quot;urbanized areas&quot;. In 1960, the Census Bureau also identified unincorporated places inside urbanized areas (except in New England, whose political geography is based on the New England town, and is distinctly different from other areas of the U.S.), but with a population of at least 10,000. For the 1970 census, the population threshold for &quot;unincorporated places&quot; in urbanized areas was reduced to 5,000.

For the 1980 census, the designation was changed to &quot;census designated places&quot; and the designation was made available for places inside urbanized areas in New England. For the 1990 census, the population threshold for CDPs in urbanized areas was reduced to 2,500. From 1950 through 1990, the Census Bureau specified other population requirements for unincorporated places or CDPs in Alaska, Puerto Rico, island areas, and Native American reservations. Minimum population criteria for CDPs were dropped with the 2000 census.

The Census Bureau&#x27;s Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) allows designated participants to review and suggest modifications to the boundaries for CDPs. The PSAP was to be offered to county and municipal planning agencies during 2008.

==Effects of designation and examples==
The boundaries of such places may be defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials, but are not fixed, and do not affect the status of local government or incorporation; the territories thus defined are strictly statistical entities. CDP boundaries may change from one census to the next to reflect changes in settlement patterns. Further, as statistical entities, the boundaries of the CDP may not correspond with local understanding of the area with the same name. Recognized communities may be divided into two or more CDPs while on the other hand, two or more communities may be combined into one CDP. A CDP may also cover the unincorporated part of a named community, where the rest lies within an incorporated place.

By defining an area as a CDP, that locality then appears in the same category of census data as incorporated places. This distinguishes CDPs from other census classifications, such as minor civil divisions (MCDs), which are in a separate category.

The population and demographics of the CDP are included in the data of county subdivisions containing the CDP. Generally, a CDP shall not be defined within the boundaries of what the Census Bureau regards to be an incorporated city, village or borough. However, the Census Bureau considers some towns in New England states, New Jersey and New York as well as townships in some other states as MCDs, even though they are incorporated municipalities in those states. In such states, CDPs may be defined within such towns or spanning the boundaries of multiple towns.

==Purpose of designation==
There are a number of reasons for the CDP designation:
* The area may be more urban than its surroundings, having a concentration of population with a definite residential nucleus, such as Whitmore Lake, Michigan; Hershey, Pennsylvania; Metairie, Louisiana; and The Villages, Florida (the latter CDP covering only a portion of the overall community).
* A formerly incorporated place may disincorporate or be partly annexed by a neighboring town, but the former town or a part of it may still be reported by the census as a CDP by meeting criteria for a CDP. Examples are the former village of Covedale (village in Ohio), compared with Covedale (CDP), Ohio, or the former village of Seneca Falls (CDP), New York, disincorporated in 2011.
* The area may contain an easily recognizable institution, usually occupying a large land area, with an identity distinct from the surrounding community. This could apply to some college campuses and large military bases (or parts of a military base) that are not within the limits of any existing community, such as Notre Dame, Indiana, Stanford, California (which houses the Stanford University campus), Fort Campbell North, Kentucky, and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.
* In other cases, the boundary of an incorporated place may bisect a recognized community. An example of this is Bostonia, California, which straddles the city limits of El Cajon. The USGS places the nucleus of Bostonia within El Cajon. The Bostonia CDP covers the greater El Cajon area in unincorporated San Diego County that is generally north of that part of Bostonia within El Cajon.
* In some states, a CDP may be defined within an incorporated municipality that (for the purposes of the census) is regarded as a minor civil division. For example, all towns in New England are incorporated municipalities, but may also include both rural and urban areas. CDPs may be defined to describe urbanized areas within such municipalities, as in the case of North Amherst, Massachusetts.
* Hawaii is the only state that has no incorporated places recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau below the county level. All data for places in Hawaii reported by the census are CDPs.
* A few CDPs represent an aggregation of several nearby communities - for example, Shorewood–Tower Hills–Harbert, Michigan, or Egypt Lake-Leto, Florida. However, the Census Bureau discontinued this method for most CDPs during the 2010 census.
* In rare cases, a CDP was also defined for the urbanized area surrounding an incorporated municipality, but which is outside the municipal boundaries, for example, Greater Galesburg, Michigan, or Greater Upper Marlboro, Maryland. This practice was discontinued in 2010.
* In some states, the Census Bureau designates entire minor civil divisions (MCD) with an urban or suburban character as CDPs (for example West Bloomfield Township, Michigan, or Reading, Massachusetts). Such designations are used in states where the MCDs function with strong governmental authority and provide services equivalent to an incorporated municipality (New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). MCDs appear in a separate category in census data from places (i.e., incorporated places and CDPs); however, when MCDs strongly resemble incorporated places, CDPs coterminous with the MCDs are defined so that such places appear in both categories of census data.

<text>Jesse Donald Knotts (July 21, 1924February 24, 2006) was an American actor and comedian. He is widely known for his role as Deputy Sheriff Barney Fife on the 1960s sitcom &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, for which he earned five Emmy Awards. He also played Ralph Furley on the sitcom &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; from 1979 to 1984. He starred in multiple comedic films, including leading roles in &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Ghost and Mr. Chicken&quot; (1966). In 2004, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him number 27 on its &quot;50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time&quot; list.

Knotts was born in West Virginia, the youngest of four children. In the 1940s, before earning a college degree, he served in the United States Army and in World War II. While enlisted, he chose to become a ventriloquist and comedian as part of a G.I. variety show, &quot;Stars and Gripes&quot;.

After the army, he got his first major break on television on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He gained wide recognition as part of the repertory company on Steve Allen&#x27;s variety show, where he played the &quot;extremely nervous man&quot; in Allen&#x27;s mock &quot;Man in the Street&quot; interviews. In 1958, Knotts made his film debut in the adapted version of &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;.

Knotts was cast as deputy Barney Fife on television&#x27;s &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, which ran from 1960 to 1968. He reprised the character on other shows, such as &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; and &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;. Knotts won five Emmy Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy.

== Early life ==
Knotts was born in Morgantown, West Virginia, the youngest of four sons of farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife Elsie Luzetta Knotts (née Moore), who were married in Spraggs, Pennsylvania. His English paternal ancestors emigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in Queen Anne&#x27;s County, Maryland. His brothers were named Willis, William and Ralph (who was called &quot;Sid&quot;).

Knotts&#x27;s mother was 40 years old at his birth. His father, who had schizophrenia and battled alcoholism, sometimes terrorized him with a knife, causing him to turn inwards at an early age. His father died of pneumonia when Knotts was 13. He and his brothers were subsequently raised by their mother, who ran a boarding house in Morgantown. She died in 1969 at age 84. Her son William preceded her in death in 1941 at age 31. They are buried in the family plot at Beverly Hills Memorial Park in Morgantown.

Knotts graduated from Morgantown High School. After enlisting in the United States Army and serving in World War II, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education with a minor in speech from West Virginia University in Morgantown, graduating in 1948. He was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity at WVU.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Before he entered high school, Knotts began performing as a ventriloquist and comedian at various church and school functions. After high school, he traveled to New York City to try to make his way as a comedian, but when his career failed to take off, he returned home to attend West Virginia University. After his freshman year, he joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops. He toured the western Pacific Islands as a comedian, in a G.I. variety show called &quot;Stars and Gripes&quot;. His ventriloquist act included a dummy named Danny that Knotts grew to hate and eventually threw overboard, according to friend and castmate Al Checco.

Knotts served in the army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946, in the Army&#x27;s 6817th Special Services Battalion. He was discharged at the rank of Technician Grade 5, equivalent at the time to corporal. During his service, he was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, the Philippine Liberation Medal, the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal (with four bronze service stars), the American Campaign Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Army Marksman Badge (with an M1 Carbine) and the Honorable Service Lapel Pin.

After being demobilized, Knotts returned to West Virginia University and graduated in 1948. He married Kay Metz and moved back to New York, where connections that he had made in the Special Services Branch helped him to break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character &quot;Windy Wales&quot; on a radio Western called &quot;Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders&quot;.

Knotts got his first break on television on the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow,&quot; where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on Steve Allen&#x27;s variety show as part of Allen&#x27;s repertory company, most notably in Allen&#x27;s mock &quot;Man in the Street&quot; interviews, always playing an extremely nervous man. He remained with Allen through the 1959–1960 season.

From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, he appeared with Andy Griffith in the Broadway stage version of &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;, in which he played two roles, listed in the &quot;Playbill&quot; as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher. In 1958, he made his movie debut with Griffith in the film version of &quot;No Time for Sergeants,&quot; in which he reprised his Broadway role, playing a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit.

=== &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; ===
In 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own sitcom, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (1960–1968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy—and originally cousin—of Sheriff Andy Taylor (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts&#x27;s portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned for him five Emmy Awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy.

A summary of the show from the website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications describes Deputy Barney Fife:

When the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his straight man, similar to their roles in &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, &quot;By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.&quot;

Knotts believed remarks by Griffith that &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with Universal Studios. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed the contract when Griffith announced his decision to continue the series; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing that he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character&#x27;s absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife having finally made the &quot;big time&quot;, joining the Raleigh, North Carolina, police force.

=== Post-Mayberry film career ===

Knotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series. He had a cameo appearance in United Artists&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), and starred in Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;The Incredible Mr. Limpet&quot; (1964). Knotts began his Universal five-film contract with &quot;The Ghost and Mr. Chicken&quot; (1966), followed by &quot;The Reluctant Astronaut&quot; (1967), &quot;The Shakiest Gun in the West&quot; (1968), &quot;The Love God?&quot; (1969) and &quot;How to Frame a Figg&quot; (1971).

Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s. He made five guest appearances on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (earning another two Emmy Awards), and he appeared once on the spin-off &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot;, in which he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, Helen Crump. He continued to work steadily, although he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until 1979, when he took the part of landlord Ralph Furley on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for Dodge trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he hosted a variety show/sitcom hybrid on NBC, &quot;The Don Knotts Show&quot;, which aired on Tuesdays during autumn 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived, and Knotts was uncomfortable with the variety show format. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows, such as &quot;The Bill Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of &quot;The New Andy Griffith Show&quot;. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of &quot;The New Scooby Doo Movies&quot;: &quot;The Spooky Fog of Juneberry&quot;, in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Knott Coming to Dinner&quot;. He appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, with Art Carney as Oscar Madison, and toured in the Neil Simon comedy &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot;.

Beginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with Tim Conway in a series of slapstick films aimed at children, including the Disney film &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot; (1975) and its sequel, &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again&quot; (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy &quot;The Prize Fighter&quot; (1979) and the mystery-comedy &quot;The Private Eyes&quot; (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including &quot;Gus&quot; (1976), &quot;No Deposit, No Return&quot; (1976), &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot; (1977), and &quot;Hot Lead and Cold Feet&quot; (1978).

=== &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; ===
In 1979, Knotts returned to series television as the wacky but lovable landlord Ralph Furley on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, Stanley and Helen Roper (a married couple played by Norman Fell and Audra Lindley, respectively), left to star in their own short-lived spin-off series &quot;The Ropers&quot;.

On the set, Knotts easily integrated himself into the already established cast, who were, as John Ritter put it, &quot;so scared&quot; of Knotts because of his star status. When Suzanne Somers left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers&#x27;s Chrissy to Knotts&#x27;s Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; script supervisor Carol Summers became Knotts&#x27;s agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.

=== Later years ===
In 1986, Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;, reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, he joined the cast of the first-run syndicated comedy &quot;What a Country!&quot;, as Principal Bud McPherson, for its remaining 13 episodes. It was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;. From 1988 until 1992, Knotts joined Andy Griffith on &quot;Matlock&quot; in the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun.

His roles became more sporadic, including a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Big Bully&quot; (1996) as the high school principal. In 1998, he had a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in &quot;Pleasantville&quot;. That year, his hometown of Morgantown, West Virginia, changed the name of the street formerly known as South University Avenue (U.S. Route 119) to Don Knotts Boulevard on &quot;Don Knotts Day&quot;. Also on that day, in honor of Knotts&#x27;s role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the Monongalia County Sheriff&#x27;s Department.

Knotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with Scooby-Doo in the video game &quot;Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights&quot;. He also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for Cartoon Network, and in a parody on &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, on which he was teamed with Phyllis Diller. In 2003, he teamed up again with Tim Conway to provide voices for the direct-to-video children&#x27;s series &quot;Hermie and Friends&quot;, which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in &quot;Chicken Little&quot; (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979.

On September 12, 2003, he was in Kansas City, in a stage version of &quot;On Golden Pond,&quot; when he received a call from John Ritter&#x27;s family telling him that his former &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; co-star had died that day of an aortic dissection. He and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter for the last time in 2003 in a cameo on &quot;8 Simple Rules... for Dating My Teenage Daughter,&quot; in an episode that paid homage to their previous television series. Knotts was the last &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; star to work with Ritter.

During this period of time, macular degeneration in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, he parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a Paul Young variation in a &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; sketch on &quot;The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards&quot;. He parodied that part one final time in &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, an episode of the sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show,&quot; in which he played the landlord. It was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in &quot;Air Buddies&quot; (2006), a direct-to-video sequel to &quot;Air Bud&quot;, voicing the sheriff&#x27;s deputy dog Sniffer.

== Personal life ==

Knotts&#x27;s friend Al Checco said, &quot;Don was somewhat of a ladies&#x27; man. He fancied himself something of a Frank Sinatra. The ladies loved him and he dated quite a bit.&quot; Knotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. They had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress Karen Knotts (born April 2, 1954). After they divorced, Knotts raised his daughter as a single parent. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974; they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006.

Knotts struggled with hypochondria and macular degeneration. Betty Lynn, one of his co-stars on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, described him as a &quot;very quiet man. Very sweet. Nothing like Barney Fife.&quot; TV writer Mark Evanier called him &quot;the most beloved person in all of show business&quot;.

== Death ==
Knotts died at age 81 on February 24, 2006, at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles from pulmonary and respiratory complications of pneumonia related to lung cancer. He underwent treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the months before his death but returned home after reportedly feeling better. He was buried at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.

Knotts&#x27;s obituaries cited him as a major influence on other entertainers. In early 2011, his grave&#x27;s plain granite headstone was replaced with a bronze plaque depicting several of his movie and television roles. A statue honoring him, created by Jamie Lester, was unveiled on July 23, 2016, in front of The Metropolitan Theatre on High Street in his hometown of Morgantown, West Virginia.

<text>Luis de Góngora y Argote (born Luis de Argote y Góngora; ; 11 July 1561 – 24 May 1627) was a Spanish Baroque lyric poet and a Catholic prebendary for the Church of Córdoba. Góngora and his lifelong rival, Francisco de Quevedo, are widely considered the most prominent Spanish poets of all time. His style is characterized by what was called &quot;culteranismo&quot;, also known as &quot;Gongorismo&quot;. This style apparently existed in stark contrast to Quevedo&#x27;s &quot;conceptismo&quot;, though Quevedo was highly influenced by his older rival from whom he may have isolated &quot;conceptismo&quot; elements.

==Biography==

Góngora was born to a noble family in Córdoba, where his father, Francisco de Argote, was &quot;corregidor,&quot; or judge. In a Spanish era when purity of Christian lineage (limpieza de sangre) was needed to gain access to education or official appointments, he adopted the surname of his mother, Leonor de Góngora. His uncle, Don Francisco, a prebendary of Córdoba Cathedral, renounced his post in favour of his nephew, who took deacon&#x27;s orders in 1586.
As a canon associated with this cathedral, Luis de Góngora traveled on diverse commissions to Navarre, Andalusia and Castile. The cities that he visited included Madrid, Salamanca, Granada, Jaén, and Toledo. Around 1605, he was ordained priest, and afterwards lived at Valladolid and Madrid. While in Madrid, he attended the Medrano Academy (Poetic Academy of Madrid) founded by its president Sebastian Francisco de Medrano between 1616–1622.

While his circle of admirers grew, patrons were grudging in their admiration. Ultimately, in 1617 through the influence of the Duke of Lerma, he was appointed honorary chaplain to King Philip III of Spain, but did not enjoy the honour long.

He maintained a long feud with Francisco de Quevedo, who wanted to match his influence in talent and wit. Both poets composed many bitter, satirical pieces attacking one another, with Quevedo criticizing Góngora&#x27;s penchant for flattery, his large nose, and his passion for gambling. Quevedo even accused his enemy of sodomy, which was a capital crime in 17th century Spain. In his &quot;Contra el mismo (Góngora)&quot;, Quevedo writes of Góngora: &quot;No altar, garito sí; poco cristiano, / mucho tahúr, no clérigo, sí arpía.&quot; (English: There&#x27;s no altar, but there&#x27;s a gambling den; not much of a Christian, / but he&#x27;s very much a cardsharp, not a cleric, definitely a harpy). Góngora&#x27;s nose, the subject of Quevedo&#x27;s &quot;A una nariz&quot;, begins with the lines: &quot;Érase un hombre a una nariz pegado, / érase una nariz superlativa, / érase una alquitara medio viva, / érase un peje espada muy barbado&quot; (English: Once there was a man stuck to a nose, / it was a nose more marvellous than weird, / it was a nearly living web of tubes, / it was a swordfish with an awful beard).

This angry feud came to a nasty end for Góngora when Quevedo bought the house Góngora lived in for the sole purpose of ejecting him from it. In 1626 a severe illness, which seriously impaired the poet&#x27;s memory, forced him to return to Córdoba, where he died the following year. By then he was broke from trying to obtain positions and win lawsuits for all his relatives. He was buried in one of the side chapels in the Mezquita section of the Córdoba cathedral where his funeral monument can be seen.

An edition of his poems was published almost immediately after his death by Juan López de Vicuña; the frequently reprinted edition by Hozes did not appear until 1633. The collection consists of numerous sonnets, odes, ballads, songs for guitar, and of some larger poems, such as the &quot;Soledades&quot; and the &quot;Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea&quot; (&quot;Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea&quot;) (1612), the two landmark works of the highly refined style called &quot;culteranismo&quot; or &quot;Gongorismo&quot;. Miguel de Cervantes, in his &quot;Viaje del Parnaso&quot;, catalogued the good and bad poets of his time. He considered Góngora to be one of the good ones.

Velázquez painted his portrait. Numerous documents, lawsuits and satires by his rival Quevedo paint a picture of a man jovial, sociable, and talkative, who loved card-playing and bullfights. His bishop accused him of rarely attending choir, and of praying less than fervently when he did go. Góngora&#x27;s passion for card-playing ultimately contributed to his ruin. Frequent allusions and metaphors associated with card-playing in Góngora&#x27;s poetry reveal that cards formed part of his daily life. He was often reproached for activities beneath the dignity of a churchman.

==Style==
&quot;Culteranismo&quot; apparently existed in stark contrast with &quot;conceptismo&quot;, another movement of the Baroque period which is characterized by a witty style, wordplay, simple vocabulary, and conveying multiple meanings in as few words as possible. However, all elements of &quot;conceptismo&quot; were already present in Góngora&#x27;s late style, which was passionately debated and misunderstood even by his defenders. The best-known representative of Spanish &quot;conceptismo&quot;, Francisco de Quevedo, had an ongoing feud with Luis de Góngora in which each criticized the other&#x27;s writing and personal life.

The word culteranismo blends &quot;culto&quot; (&quot;cultivated&quot;) and &quot;luteranismo&quot; (&quot;Lutheranism&quot;) and was coined by its opponents to present it as a heresy of &quot;true&quot; poetry. The movement aimed to use as many words as possible to convey little meaning or to conceal meaning. &quot;Góngora&#x27;s poetry is inclusive rather than exclusive&quot;, one scholar has written, &quot;willing to create and incorporate the new, literally in the form of neologisms.&quot;

Góngora had a penchant for highly Latinate and Greek neologisms, which his opponents mocked. Quevedo lampooned his rival by writing a sonnet, &quot;Aguja de navegar cultos,&quot; which listed words from Góngora&#x27;s lexicon: &quot;He would like to be a culto poet in just one day, / must the following jargon learn: / &quot;Fulgores, arrogar, joven, presiente / candor, construye, métrica, armonía...&quot;&quot; Quevedo actually mocked Góngora&#x27;s style in several sonnets, including &quot;Sulquivagante, pretensor de Estolo.&quot; This anti-Gongorist sonnet mocks the supposed unintelligibility of culteranismo and its widespread use of flowery neologisms, including &quot;sulquivagante&quot; (he who plies the seas; to travel without a clear destination); &quot;speluncas&quot; (&quot;caves&quot;); &quot;surculos&quot; (sprouts, scions). He was also the first to write poems imitating the speech of blacks.
Góngora also had a penchant for apparent breaks in syntactical flow, as he overturned the limitations of syntax, making the hyperbaton the most prominent feature of his poetry.

He has been called a man of &quot;unquestioned genius and almost limitless culture, an initiator who enriched his language with the vast power, beauty, and scope of a mighty pen.&quot; As far away as Peru, he received the praise of Juan de Espinosa Medrano (ca. 1629–1688), who wrote a piece defending Góngora&#x27;s poetry from criticism called &quot;Apologético en favor de Don Luis de Góngora, Príncipe de los poetas lyricos de España: contra Manuel de Faria y Sousa, Cavallero portugués&quot; (1662).

As Dámaso Alonso has pointed out, Góngora&#x27;s contribution to the Spanish language should not be underestimated, as he picked up what were in his time obscure or little-used words and used them in his poetry again and again, thereby reviving or popularizing them. Many of these words are quite common today, such as &quot;adolescente&quot;, &quot;asunto&quot;, &quot;brillante&quot;, &quot;construir&quot;, &quot;eclipse&quot;, &quot;emular&quot;, &quot;erigir&quot;, &quot;fragmento&quot;, &quot;frustrar&quot;, &quot;joven&quot;, &quot;meta&quot;, and &quot;porción&quot;.

== Works ==
Góngora&#x27;s poems are usually grouped into two blocks, corresponding more or less to two successive poetic stages. His &quot;Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea&quot; (&quot;Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea&quot;) and his &quot;Soledades&quot; (1613) are his best-known compositions and the most studied. The &quot;Fábula&quot; is written in royal octaves (&quot;octavas reales&quot;) and his &quot;Soledades&quot; is written in a variety of metres and strophes, but principally in stanzas and &quot;silvas&quot; interspersed with choruses.

Góngora&#x27;s &quot;Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea&quot; (1612) narrates a mythological episode described in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;: the love of Polyphemus, one of the Cyclopes, for the nymph Galatea, who rejects him. In the poem&#x27;s end, Acis, enamored with Galatea, is turned into a river.

Góngora&#x27;s &quot;Fábula de Píramo y Tisbe&quot; (&quot;Fable of Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;) (1618) is a complex poem that mocks gossiping and avaricious women. Góngora also wrote sonnets concerning various subjects of an amatory, satirical, moral, philosophical, religious, controversial, laudatory, and funereal nature. As well as the usual topics (&quot;carpe diem&quot; etc.) the sonnets include autobiographical elements, describing, for example, the increasing decrepitude and advancing age of the author. In addition, Góngora composed one of his most ambitions works, &quot;El Panegírico al Duque de Lerma&quot; (1617), a poem in 79 royal octaves. Cervantes, after reading &quot;El Panegírico&quot;, said: &quot;the [work] I most esteem from those I&#x27;ve read of his.&quot;

He also wrote plays, which include &quot;La destrucción de Troya&quot;, &quot;Las firmezas de Isabela&quot;, and the unfinished &quot;Doctor Carlino&quot;.

Although Góngora did not publish his works (he had attempted to do so in 1623), manuscript copies were circulated and compiled in cancioneros (songbooks), and anthologies published with or without his permission. In 1627, Juan Lopez Vicuña published &quot;Verse Works of the Spanish Homer&quot;, which is also considered very trustworthy and important in establishing the Góngora&#x27;s corpus of work. Vicuña&#x27;s work was appropriated by the Spanish Inquisition and was later surpassed by an edition by Gonzalo de Hozes in 1633.

==Góngora and the Generation of &#x27;27==
The Generation of &#x27;27 took its name from the year 1927 in which the tricentennial of Góngora&#x27;s death, ignored by official academic circles, was celebrated with recitals, avant-garde happenings, and an ambitious plan to publish a new critical edition of his work, as well as books and articles on aspects of his work that had not been fully researched.

The Generation of &#x27;27 was the first to attempt to self-consciously revive baroque literature. Dámaso Alonso wrote that Góngora&#x27;s complex language conveyed meaning in that it created a world of pure beauty. Alonso explored his work exhaustively and called Góngora a &quot;mystic of words.&quot; Alonso dispelled the notion that Góngora had two separate styles – &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;difficult&quot; poems – that were also divided chronologically between his early and later years. He argued that Góngora&#x27;s more complex poems built on stylistic devices that had been created in Góngora&#x27;s early career as a poet. He also argued that the apparent simplicity of some of Góngora&#x27;s early poems is often deceptive.

Rafael Alberti added his own &quot;Soledad tercera&quot; (&quot;Paráfrasis incompleta&quot;). In 1961, Alberti declared, &quot;I am a visual poet, like all of the poets from Andalusia, from Góngora to García Lorca.&quot;

García Lorca presented a lecture called &quot;La imagen poética en don Luís de Góngora&quot; at the Ateneo in Seville in 1927. In this lecture, García Lorca paid Jean Epstein the compliment of comparing the film director with Góngora as an authority on images.

==References in fiction and philosophy==
The philosopher Baruch Spinoza proposed in his &quot;Ethics&quot; (1677) that a man can die before his body stops moving. As an example he mentioned &quot;a Spanish poet who suffered an illness; though he recovered, he was left so oblivious to his past life that he did not believe the tales and tragedies he had written were his own&quot;. The historian Carl Gebhardt wrote that &quot;this was probably Góngora, whose works Spinoza possessed, and who lost his memory a year before his death&quot;.

The narrator of the Captain Alatriste series, a friend of Francisco de Quevedo within the stories, illustrates Góngora&#x27;s feuding with Quevedo, both by quoting poetry from each as well as describing Quevedo&#x27;s attitude toward Góngora through the course of the story. Excerpts of poetry from one against the other are included within the story itself and poetry from each is included at the back of some of the books.

In Giannina Braschi&#x27;s bilingual novel &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; (1998) contemporary Latin American poets have a heated debate about Góngora&#x27;s and Quevedo&#x27;s role in defining the Spanish empire through their works.

The musical group Dead Can Dance used an English translation of Góngora&#x27;s &quot;Da bienes Fortuna&quot; as the lyrics for the song &quot;Fortune Presents Gifts Not According to the Book&quot; on their 1990 album Aion.

In the second of the five parts of Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s novel &quot;2666&quot; (published posthumously in 2004), &quot;The Part about Amalfitano&quot;, one of the characters (the poet, whose name is never explicitly stated) quotes a verse from Góngora: &quot;Ande yo caliente y ríase la gente&quot;.

John Crowley&#x27;s novel &quot;The Solitudes&quot; (a.k.a.&quot;Aegypt&quot;, 1987) repeatedly refers to and quotes from Góngora&#x27;s poem &quot;Soledades.&quot;

A portrait of Luis de Góngora appears as an Easter egg in the 2018 video game . This inclusion likely serves as a symbolic reference to the game&#x27;s exploration of themes such as identity, the human condition, and the blurred lines between appearance and reality—concepts that Góngora&#x27;s poetry often delved into.

<doc id="269778" wikidata="Q516636" url="?curid=269778" title="Lady Byng Memorial Trophy">
<text>The Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, formerly known as the Lady Byng Trophy, is presented each year to the National Hockey League &quot;player adjudged to have exhibited the best type of sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with a high standard of playing ability.&quot; The Lady Byng Memorial Trophy has been awarded 89 times to 53 different players since it was first awarded in 1925. The original trophy was donated to the league by Lady Byng of Vimy, then–viceregal consort of Canada.

The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the Stanley Cup Playoffs.

==History==
The trophy is named in honour of Marie Evelyn Moreton (Lady Byng), wife of the Viscount Byng of Vimy, who commanded Canadian forces at the Battle of Vimy Ridge and who was Governor General of Canada from 1921 to 1926. Lady Byng, an avid hockey fan, decided to donate the trophy to the NHL in 1924–25.

Lady Byng decided the trophy&#x27;s first winner would be Frank Nighbor of the original Ottawa Senators. Late in the season, she invited Nighbor to Rideau Hall, showed him the trophy, and asked him if the NHL would accept it as an award for its most gentlemanly player. When Nighbor said he thought it would, Lady Byng, much to Nighbor&#x27;s surprise, awarded him the trophy.

After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won the award seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so impressed that she gave him the original trophy to keep. She then donated a second trophy in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in a fire at Boucher&#x27;s home.

==Award winners==
Besides Boucher, a number of players have won the award multiple times, including Wayne Gretzky who won it five times, Red Kelly and Pavel Datsyuk with four wins, and Bobby Bauer, Alex Delvecchio, Mike Bossy, Martin St. Louis, and Ron Francis with three each. Because of Boucher&#x27;s seven wins, the New York Rangers join Detroit as the only two clubs who have won the award fourteen times, followed by Toronto with nine wins, Chicago and Boston tied with eight, and Los Angeles with six. Adam Oates was a six-time finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy but never won.

Five players have won both the Lady Byng Trophy and the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP in the same season: Buddy O&#x27;Connor (1947–48), Bobby Hull (1964–65), Stan Mikita (1966–67 and 1967–68), Wayne Gretzky (1979–80) and Joe Sakic (2000–01). Mikita is also the only player to win the Hart, Art Ross, and Lady Byng trophies in the same season, doing so consecutively in the 1966–67 and 1967–68 seasons. Gretzky, Bobby Hull, and Martin St. Louis also won these three awards, but not in the same season. Bobby and Brett Hull are the only father–son combination to win the Hart and Lady Byng trophies.

Bill Quackenbush, Jaccob Slavin, Red Kelly, and Brian Campbell are the only defensemen to have won the Lady Byng Trophy, with Kelly and Slavin being the only ones to win it multiple times. Kelly holds a record three as a defenseman (four overall). After Kelly, no defenseman won the award for a 58-year stretch, which ended in 2012 when Campbell received the honor, although Nicklas Lidstrom narrowly lost to Joe Sakic in 2001. No goaltender has ever won the award.

<doc id="269780" wikidata="Q794549" url="?curid=269780" title="Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport">
<text>Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport, also known as Jean Lesage International Airport (French: &quot;Aéroport international Jean-Lesage de Québec&quot;, or &quot;Aéroport de Québec&quot;) , is the primary airport serving Quebec City, Canada. Designated as an international airport by Transport Canada, it is located west-southwest of the city. In 2023, it was the 12th-busiest airport in Canada, with 1,688,736 passengers. More than ten airlines offer 360 weekly flights to destinations across Canada, the United States, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Europe.

==Overview==
The airport was established in 1939, a year after the closure of the Aérodrome Saint-Louis. First established as a training facility for air observers, the first flight occurred on September 11, 1941. First known as the Aéroport de l&#x27;Ancienne Lorette, then the Aéroport de Sainte-Foy, and later the Aéroport de Québec, it was renamed to Aéroport international Jean-Lesage in 1993, in honour of Jean Lesage, the former Premier of Quebec. The airport is managed and operated by Aéroport de Québec inc., a non-profit and non-share corporation. The current terminal building has a capacity of 1.4 million passengers annually.

Beginning in 2006, with a budget of $65.8 million, Québec/Jean Lesage International Airport underwent a modernization designed to increase the terminal&#x27;s capacity and substantially enhance the level of passenger service. The modernization included reconfiguring the terminal on two levels, restructuring the baggage handling area and arrivals area, and reconfiguring and enlargement of the waiting rooms. Fifty-four percent of the financing was provided directly by Aéroport de Québec inc. Completed in June 2008, the new configuration of the airport now enables it to handle 1.4 million passengers a year.

Based on the passenger figures for 2009 and 2010, it became clear that the terminal building would reach its design capacity by 2012. Aéroport de Québec inc. is therefore planning further investments of nearly $300 million to expand the terminal building further. Presently the terminal has 17 gates: 12 contact gates and five walk-out aircraft positions. This will increase to 24 gates by 2025.

On July 4, 2011, work began on the second phase of the airport expansion, which lasted until 2017. Partially funded through an Airport Improvement Fee, the terminal building doubled in size, at a cost of $224.8 million. The work included expanding the international facilities, constructing runways, taxiways, and de-icing pads, and enhancing customer service facilities. On September 19, 2013, runway 12/30 was renamed to runway 11/29.

The airport charges an Airport Improvement Fee (AIF) to each passenger, it is amongst the highest in Canada at $35 per passenger.

On 10 March 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Barack Obama announced the addition of the airport to the list of Canadian airports containing U.S. border preclearance facilities. In 2019, Trudeau and President Donald Trump also announced that the airport would obtain border preclearance. However, as of March 2024, preclearance is not yet available.

On December 11, 2017, the first phase of YQB2018, the expansion project, was completed with the opening of the new international terminal. The new facility features more dedicated baggage carousels serving international flights, a new customs area, an expanded food court and restaurant area including Starbucks, Pidz, and Nourc, four new gates (34 to 37), an improved and larger loading area for cars and buses, and a larger capacity baggage area.

The last expansion phase, which involved linking the domestic and international terminals, was completed in the summer of 2019.

Also added as part of the most recent expansion are 10 holes in the security fence placed at positions determined jointly by the airport authority and a local plane spotting group. These holes are sized to allow photographers to insert telephoto lenses and are specifically reserved for their use. In 2019, the American website &quot;Digital Photography Review&quot; called the airport &quot;the number one spot for aviation photographers&quot;.

==Facilities==
===Infrastructure===

YQB International Airport receives various long-, mid- and short-haul aircraft. The airport has two runways. Its longest runway northeast-southwesterly direction is 06/24, having a length of . Runway 24 is YQB&#x27;s main approach pattern equipped with Area navigation (RNAV), required navigation performance (RNP), and non-directional beacon (NDB) approach. Runway 06 has the same approaches with the addition of an instrument landing system (ILS).

There are seven taxiways: Alpha (connecting the main apron with runway 24), Bravo (connecting the main apron with runway 29), Charlie, Delta (parallel to the 06/24), Echo (connecting the main apron with runway 24), Golf (which links Delta to the threshold of runway 06) and Hotel (between Golf and runway 11/29). The airport aprons can accommodate light to large aircraft (12 aerobridge and nine remotes) simultaneously and are designed to accommodate wide-body jet airliners as large as the Boeing 747-400. YQB doesn&#x27;t have a Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS) or Parallax Aircraft Parking Aid (PAPA); all stands are assisted by ground operations using marshaling wands–handheld illuminated beacons.

Ramp 3 is where all the flight schools and private airlines are located. Chrono Aviation, Skyjet/Air Liaison, Orizon Aviation, CFAQ, Strait Air, and Avjet/TSAS are the main users of this apron.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 9 September 1949, Canadian Pacific Air Lines Flight 108 on a flight from Montreal to Baie-Comeau with a stopover in Quebec City crash-landed east of Quebec City when a bomb exploded on board shortly after departing from Quebec City Jean Lesage Airport (then known as L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette Airport), killing all 19 passengers and four crew. The incident and trial that followed would be known as the Albert Guay affair.
* On 29 March 1979, Quebecair Flight 255, a Fairchild F-27, crashed after take-off, killing 17 and injuring seven.
* On 23 June 2010, a Beechcraft A100 King Air of Aeropro (C-FGIN) crashed north of the airport just after taking off from runway 30 (now runway 29), killing all seven people on board.
* On 12 October 2017, a drone collided with a passenger plane for the first time in North America. The drone struck the turboprop passenger plane operated by Skyjet Aviation while it was on approach. The drone was operating above the flight height restriction and within the exclusion zone around airports, violating drone operating regulations.

<doc id="269784" wikidata="Q1345785" url="?curid=269784" title="Halifax Stanfield International Airport">
<text>Halifax Stanfield International Airport is a Canadian airport in Goffs, Nova Scotia, a rural community of the Halifax Regional Municipality. It serves the Halifax region, mainland Nova Scotia, and adjacent areas in the neighbouring Maritime provinces. The airport is named in honour of Robert Stanfield, the 17th Premier of Nova Scotia and former leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

The airport, owned by Transport Canada since it opened in 1960, has been operated since 2000 by the Halifax International Airport Authority (HIAA). It forms part of the National Airports System.

Designated as an international airport by Transport Canada, Halifax Stanfield is the 8th busiest airport in Canada by passenger traffic. It handled a total of 3,979,785 passengers in 2024 and 84,045 aircraft movements in 2017. It is an operating base for Cougar Helicopters, Maritime Air Charter, and PAL Airlines, as well as a focus city for Air Canada and Porter Airlines.

==History==
===Background===
An airfield in the West End, known as Chebucto Field, was built as the Halifax Civic Airport by the City of Halifax in 1931 on the former site of Blueball Farm. It served as the city&#x27;s main airport until 1941, when it was closed and leased to the federal government to serve as an army camp in World War II. Today Saunders Park, named after the first Halifax airport manager and Aero Club manager Donald Saunders, and some parts of the residential area of Westmount Subdivision, mark the site. RCAF Station Shearwater subsequently functioned as Halifax&#x27;s primary airport until the current airport was opened. In October 1945, the City of Halifax asked the federal Department of Transport for help choosing a site for a new civil airport.

A key factor was to find a site near Halifax with a minimal number of days per year when fog would affect airport operation. Lucasville was favoured, but after a year of study it was found to have similar average visibility to the frequently foggy airport at Shearwater. A site near Kelly Lake was then scrutinized based on a recommendation by Trans-Canada Air Lines. After two years of monitoring, the site was officially approved in 1954 for construction of a modern, C$5 million airport. The land was purchased by the City of Halifax on April 5, 1955, while the Department of Transport was tasked with building the airport.

=== Construction and early years ===
Construction of the new airport began in November 1955. The runways were built by Diamond Construction of Halifax. The modernist terminal building was designed by Gilleland and Strutt, an architecture firm which previously designed a similar-looking terminal at Ottawa.

The new airport was substantially completed in June 1960, and a temporary licence for daytime visual flight rules (VFR) operations was issued that month. An opening gala was held on Dominion Day of 1960, the same day a licence permitting full operations was issued. At 4:50 am on August1, 1960 the first airplane landed there, a Vickers Viscount running the Trans-Canada Airlines Flight 400 between Montreal and Newfoundland. It was piloted by Halifax native W.E. Barnes. The first overseas flight arrived an hour later, travelling from London en route to Montreal. The airport was formally inaugurated on September 10, 1960, by the Minister of Transport, George Hees. The ultimate cost of construction was about $18 million.

Passenger numbers grew steadily during the first few decades of operation. The passenger terminal was substantially renovated in 1966. A passenger terminal extension opened in July 1976, which saw the installation of the airport&#x27;s first three air bridges. New temporary passenger walkways were constructed in 1988 to serve regional carriers. By 1990, approximately 2,500,000 passengers passed through the airport annually, up from about 180,000 when it first opened. A southern expansion was opened in December 1994 by Minister of Transport Doug Young, while the check-in area was expanded in 1998.

Owing to the National Airports Policy, announced in 1994, the Halifax International Airport Authority (HIAA) was founded in November 1995. Management of the airport was officially passed from Transport Canada to HIAA on February 1, 2000.

===Operation Yellow Ribbon===
Following the September 11 attacks in 2001 the airport took part in Operation Yellow Ribbon, commenced to accept United States civilian flights after the Federal Aviation Administration closed down U.S. airspace. Halifax airport took in 47 flights—more flights than any other Canadian airport involved in the operation—carrying about 7,300 passengers—more passengers than any other Canadian airport involved in the operation other than Vancouver, which registered 8,500. Much of this was because flights that were coming from Europe were told to avoid the major airports in Central Canada, like Toronto Pearson, Montréal-Dorval, and Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport.

Shortly after the attacks, the airport was advised that as many as 40 to 50 planes would divert to Halifax. In response, runway 15/33 (now 14/32) was shut down to accommodate the parked aircraft. The first diverted aircraft, a United Airlines Boeing 767, arrived at 11:35 am. The number of arriving passengers greatly outstripped the capacity of the airport, which faced processing 7,000–8,000 people with an arrivals facility designed to handle 900 per hour. The Halifax municipal government was tasked with providing emergency shelter, food, transportation and care to the stranded travellers, who were housed in city sports complexes and schools, churches, universities, military bases, as well as the homes of private citizens. A memorial ceremony was held in the airport terminal on September 14, 2001.

To honour the people of Gander and Halifax for their support during the operation, Lufthansa named a new Airbus A340-300 &quot;Gander-Halifax&quot; on May 16, 2002. That airplane is listed with the registration D-AIFC, and is the first aircraft of the whole fleet with a city name outside of Germany. On September 11, 2006, five years after the attacks, United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Halifax airport and delivered a speech of thanks.

===Renaming===
After the December 2003 death of Robert Stanfield, the former Premier of Nova Scotia and federal Leader of the Official Opposition, several proposals were made in Nova Scotia to honour the widely respected politician. In early 2005 the airport&#x27;s governing board voted to rename the terminal building after Stanfield. The terminal was officially rechristened in a ceremony held on September 9, 2005, when the Stanfield family unveiled a brass memorial plaque in the airport observation floor.

On Friday February 9, 2007 Prime Minister Stephen Harper arrived at the airport and formally renamed the entire facility from &quot;Halifax International Airport&quot; to &quot;Halifax Robert L. Stanfield International Airport&quot; in a further honour to Stanfield; at that time the terminal name was dropped and reverted to its original status.

==Awards==
Halifax International Airport fared well in the 2005 AETRA survey for passenger satisfaction, produced by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Airports Council International. The airport was ranked the best airport in the Americas for the second year in a row, as well as the best airport in the less than 5 million passengers a year category for the third year in a row (worldwide), and best domestic airport for the second year in a row.

In March 2007, the airport earned two first-place finishes in the 2006 Airports Council International (ACI) Service Quality Awards held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. For the fourth consecutive year, it ranked first in overall passenger satisfaction for airports worldwide with under five million passengers. In addition, the airport ranked first in the Americas in the new category of Airport People Awards, and second in the best domestic airport worldwide category.

In early 2010, Halifax Stanfield was rated by passengers as the Best Airport in the World in its class (under 5 million) for the seventh year in a row.

In 2011 it won third &quot;Best Airport in North America&quot; of the Airport Service Quality Awards by Airports Council International, as well as 3rd &quot;Best Airport by Size&quot; in the 2 to 5 million passenger category.

==Facilities==


===Terminal===
The Air Terminal Building (ATB) was opened in August 1960. It cost about C$4.5 million to construct and, upon opening, included health, immigration and customs facilities for international passengers; a restaurant; a control tower and administrative offices; and two observation decks that projected onto the apron. It was designed by Gilleland and Strutt of Ottawa, in collaboration with C.D. Davidson of Halifax as well as A.W. Ramsey, chief architect at the Department of Transport. The main contractor was Ellis-Don. The modern complex contained Nova Scotia&#x27;s first set of escalators.

Today, the terminal serves over four million passengers per year. The growth experienced in the decades since the airport&#x27;s construction has necessitated constant renovations, and there is often construction occurring there. Since the HIAA took over management of the airport in 2000, over $200 million has been invested in improvements to the terminal building.

A new international arrivals area, three times larger than the previous one, opened at the north end of the terminal in August 2001. The upper level of this expansion included a space reserved for United States border preclearance facilities (see below). A new domestic arrivals hall, accommodating three baggage reclaim belts and a Nova Scotia visitor&#x27;s centre, officially opened on December 18, 2002. Work also began in 2002 on a significant renovation to the central lobby of the terminal building. This expanded retail and dining space opened as the Airport Square on November 9, 2003. A third-storey public observation deck opened at the same time. A southern terminal expansion was completed in 2005, expanding the departures holdroom, adding three new jet bridges, and creating a dedicated commuter aircraft facility with new ground-loading gates.

In December 2004, U.S. Customs and Border Protection approved Halifax for U.S. border preclearance. It took effect in late 2006. HIAA used to be the busiest airport in Canada without U.S. customs preclearance. On September 12, 2007, the airport authority announced the construction of a 2,300 space, five-storey parking garage, which was completed on March 12, 2009.

Several improvements to the terminal were made in 2018–19. A three-storey extension to the central portion of the terminal building was constructed, projecting into the centre apron. The ground floor houses an expanded security screening area, increasing capacity and allowing for the implementation of &quot;CATSA Plus&quot;, the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority&#x27;s latest checkpoint design, which requires more space. The second floor contains an expanded, double-height passenger waiting area, with additional seating, as well as new dining and retail space. At the same time, new security features were added around the terminal, including anti-ramming bollards, blast-resistant glazing, more security cameras, and new access control features. Lastly, the domestic baggage claim area was renovated for cosmetic reasons. Ceilings were raised, column sizes were reduced, and new flooring was installed.

The terminal now has a total of 32 gate positions, with 13 using airbridges (gates 12, 14–16, 18, 20, 22–24, and 26–28). The remaining gates are ground-loading positions. Gates 22–24 and 26–28 are swing gates: a glassed-in secure corridor allows incoming international passengers and pre-cleared departing US passengers to be segregated from those in the domestic/international departure lounge; when used for US departures, these gates are numbered 52–54 and 56–58, respectively. Gates 2 (a-e) to 9 are ground-loading positions dedicated to domestic regional operations. Gates 34 to 46 are ground-loading gate positions for US flights.

===Runways and taxiways===
Halifax Stanfield has had two runways, arranged perpendicular to each other, since opening in 1960. In press releases the airport authority refers to the longer one as the &quot;main runway&quot; and the shorter as the &quot;secondary runway&quot;.

All taxiways are wide except for the 50-foot-wide taxiway K.

The airport opened with (using the present-day naming scheme) taxiways A, B (formerly part of A), C, D (section between the apron and the main runway), G, E, F, and H. Then-taxiway B and most of taxiway D (now M and D; see below) were constructed in 1982, providing a taxi route paralleling runway 14/32. In 2010, extension of the taxiway system resulted in an increased airside area, creating space for several newly constructed large hangars. Canadian Helicopters, Cougar Helicopters, Gateway Facilities, and IMP Group operate these new hangars along taxiways J and K.

In November 2012, an extension of both ends of runway 05/23 was completed to accommodate larger, wide-body aircraft. This increased its length from to . This increase resulted in the renaming of several taxiways: taxiway B became M, and the end of taxiway A was renamed B. Taxiway F was also extended to meet the threshold of runway 23. In 2016 a new apron was constructed off taxiway J to serve primarily as a place to park cargo freighters.

The airport covers a total of 2,372 acres (960 ha) of land.

===Hotel===

As early as the 1980s, the private sector expressed interest in building a hotel next to the airport terminal. In May 1988, Halifax-based Keddy&#x27;s Motor Inns, a major Maritime hotel chain, signed a contract with Transport Canada to build a $20-million, 200-room hotel on Transport Canada-owned land opposite the terminal. Work on the Pegasus Hotel began in May 1990. After over $4 million had been spent, construction was halted in December 1990 by the main contractor, GEM Construction Specialists, due to unpaid work. Keddy&#x27;s faced financial troubles and was $35 million in debt, and project funding from a consortium of Hong Kongese and Taiwanese immigrant investors fell through. The federal government searched for a company interested in completing the project, but the only proposal received was deemed inadequate. The unfinished shell of the hotel was considered an embarrassing eyesore, and Transport Canada demolished it in 1996.

The airport authority announced on May 13, 2008, that a letter of intent had been signed with New Castle Hotels and Southwest Properties for construction of a 176-room Sheraton hotel. It was estimated to cost about $30 million and would have included a fitness centre, swimming pool, conference centre, and dining facilities. In early 2009 the airport authority and the developers jointly agreed to postpone construction of the hotel due to the global economic downturn. In early 2010 the developers pulled out of the deal.

On October 26, 2011, the airport authority announced the construction of an on-site 14-storey, 169-room, Alt Hotel. Linked to both the passenger terminal and the parking garage by an enclosed footbridge, the $27 million building was built by Marco Construction of Halifax and opened in 2013. Operated by Groupe Germain Hospitalité, the hotel includes conference and banquet facilities, a fitness centre, a pool, and a 24-hour cafe. It was built with soundproof windows to block aircraft noise.

===Operations===
The airport is served by several fixed-base operators (FBOs), which handle fueling, ground handling, hangarage, catering, etc. They include Air Canada Technical Services, Aircraft Service International, Gateway Facilities, Halifax International Fuel Facility Consortium (HIFFC), Inland Technologies, Innotech-Execaire, PAL Aviation Services, Shell AeroCentre, Strategic Aviation, and Swissport.

Halifax Regional Police provides policing services. Emergency rescue and firefighting services are based in the Combined Services Complex (CSC), which also houses the airport&#x27;s maintenance operations. The C$24-million, building opened in 2010, replacing the previous fire hall (built 1981) as well as the former maintenance garage, which opened with the airport in 1960. The complex includes a fire station, vehicular wash and storage bays, offices, conference rooms, staff rooms, sleeping quarters, and an emergency communications centre. The CSC was the first LEED certified building at the airport.

Halifax International Airport was one of a handful of sites in eastern North America designated an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle if a launch was aborted following liftoff. The airport kept in contact with Transport Canada and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration during each shuttle launch.

===Business park===
The airport is located adjacent to the Aerotech Business Park, a municipally-run business park originally catering towards aviation companies. The zoning has since been changed to allow for other types of companies to locate there. The largest tenants are Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada and L3 Communications.

== Ongoing developments ==
The latest airport master plan was published in January 2011. Many of its proposals have since been realised, such as construction of an on-site hotel, the southern terminal expansion, and extensions of the main runway. Possible future plans outlined in this document include new taxiways and parking stands, another de-icing area, space for new logistics and aviation services development, and a major expansion of the public road network (partly built) to facilitate development of a large commercial area between the airport and the highway.

On November 15, 2018, transport minister Marc Garneau announced Government of Canada funding, via the National Trade Corridors Fund, toward a $36-million expansion of the airport&#x27;s air cargo handling facilities. The federal government will contribute $18 million, while $5 million will come from the province and $13 million from the airport authority. The expansion will be built on forested land adjacent to the existing cargo area.

<doc id="269785" wikidata="Q508631" url="?curid=269785" title="William M. Jennings Trophy">
<text>The William M. Jennings Trophy is an annual National Hockey League (NHL) award given to &quot;the goaltender(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it ... based on regular-season play.&quot; From 1946 until 1981, the Vezina Trophy had been awarded under that definition, but it was later changed and replaced by the Jennings Trophy. It is named in honor of William M. Jennings, the longtime governor and president of the New York Rangers. Since its beginnings in 1982, it has been awarded at the end of 40 seasons to 44 different players; mostly in tandems of two goaltenders.

The most recent winner is Connor Hellebuyck of the Winnipeg Jets. The Jets had a league-low 199 team goals-against in the 2023–24 season.

==History==
From 1946 until the 1980–81 season, the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the goaltender(s) of the NHL team allowing the fewest goals during the regular season. However, it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual and was changed to offer the trophy to the most outstanding goaltender, as voted by the NHL general managers. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is awarded to the starting goaltender(s) playing for the team with the fewest goals against.

The Jennings Trophy was donated by the NHL&#x27;s board of governors and first presented at the conclusion of the 1981–82 season. It is named in honor of the late William M. Jennings, who was a longtime governor and president of the New York Rangers and a builder of ice hockey in the United States. Normally the minimum number of games a goaltender must play to be eligible for the trophy is 25, but for the lockout shortened 1994–95 season, the required minimum was fourteen games.

Ten players have won both the Jennings and Vezina Trophy for the same season: Patrick Roy ( and ), Ed Belfour ( and ), Dominik Hasek ( and ), Martin Brodeur (, ), Miikka Kiprusoff (), Tim Thomas (), Carey Price (), Marc-Andre Fleury (), Linus Ullmark (), and Connor Hellebuyck (). Roy and Brodeur have won the trophy five times each, the most of any goaltenders. Belfour is third, having won four times. The Montreal Canadiens have the most wins, with six, followed by the New Jersey Devils and the Chicago Blackhawks with five each, the Boston Bruins with four, and the Buffalo Sabres and with three.

<doc id="269789" wikidata="Q215691" url="?curid=269789" title="Karl August Varnhagen von Ense">
<text>Karl August Varnhagen von Ense (21 February 1785 in Düsseldorf – 10 October 1858 in Berlin) was a German biographer, diplomat and soldier.

==Life and career==
He was born in Düsseldorf, the younger brother of Rosa Maria Varnhagen, a noted poet, writer, and educator. He studied medicine in Berlin, but most of his time was spent examining philosophy and literature, which he later studied more thoroughly at Halle and Tübingen. He began his literary career in 1804 working along with Adelbert von Chamisso on his Berliner &quot;Musenalmanach&quot;.

In 1809, he joined the main Austrian army under Archduke Charles, serving in IR47 Vogelsang at the Battle of Wagram, where he was wounded on the first day, 5 July. He was then made adjutant to Prince Bentheim, whom he accompanied to Paris, where he continued his studies. In 1812, he entered the Prussian civil service in Berlin but soon left to enter the Russian service as captain. He served in Tettenborn&#x27;s corps as adjutant to Tettenborn on trips to Hamburg and Paris. He recorded his experiences in &quot;Geschichte der Hamburger Ereignisse&quot; (History of the events in Hamburg; London, 1813) and &quot;Geschichte der Kriegszüge Tettenborns&quot; (History of Tettenborn&#x27;s Campaigns, 1814). He worked as a tutor and butler in the homes of several families of the wealthy Jewish bourgeoisie. This allowed him to learn from an early age young characters in his time, some already famous, such as: Adelbert von Chamisso, Justinus Kerner, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Ludwig Uhland and many other poets of romanticism.

He accompanied Prince Hardenberg to the Congress of Vienna in 1814, and between 1815 and 1819 he served as Prussian Minister-Resident at Carlsruhe. After 1819, he resided chiefly in Berlin, bearing the title &quot;Geheimer Legationsrat.&quot; He had no fixed official appointment but was often employed in important political business.

He carried on an extensive correspondence with Alexander von Humboldt, and two volumes of Humboldt&#x27;s letters to him have been published.

On 10 October 1858, while playing chess with his niece, Karl August Varnhagen von Ense died of unknown causes. His last words, shortly before his death, were, &quot;I lost.&quot;

==Writings==
Although he developed a reputation as an imaginative and critical writer, he is most famous as a biographer. He possessed a remarkable ability to group facts together and to bring out their essential significance. His style is distinguished for its strength, grace and purity. Among his principal works are:
*&quot;Goethe in den Zeugnissen der Mitlebenden&quot; (1824)
*&quot;Biographische Denkmäler&quot; (5 vols., 1824–30; 3rd edition, 1872)
*Biographies of General von Seydlitz (1834), Field-Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, victor over Napoleon at Waterloo, Sophia Charlotte, Queen of Prussia (1837), Field-Marshal Schwerin (1841), Field-Marshal Keith (1844), and General Bülow von Dennewitz (1853)
His &quot;Denkwürdigkeiten und vermischte Schriften&quot; appeared in nine volumes in 1843–59, the last two volumes appearing after his death. His niece, Ludmilla Assing, between 1860 and 1867, edited several volumes of his correspondence with eminent men and his &quot;Tagebücher&quot; (14 vols., 1861–70). &quot;Blätter aus der preussischen Geschichte&quot; appeared in five volumes (1868–69); his correspondence with his wife, Rahel, appeared in six volumes in 1874–75; and that with Carlyle in 1892.

His selected writings appeared in 19 volumes in 1871–76.

==Family==
In 1814, he married saloniste Rahel Levin after she converted from Judaism to Christianity. Varnhagen was devotedly attached to her and found in her sympathy and encouragement. She was one of the chief sources of his inspiration as a writer. He never fully recovered from the shock of her death in 1833, but he published memorial volumes containing selections from her papers: &quot;Rahel, ein Buch des Andenkens für ihre Freunde&quot; (Rahel, a memorial book for her friends, 3 vols., 1834) and &quot;Galerie von Bildnissen aus Rahels Umgang&quot; (A gallery of portraits from Rahel&#x27;s circle, 2 vols., 1836).

<text>Monomethylhydrazine (MMH) is a highly toxic, volatile hydrazine derivative with the chemical formula . It is used as a rocket propellant in bipropellant rocket engines because it is hypergolic with various oxidizers such as nitrogen tetroxide () and nitric acid (). As a propellant, it is described in specification MIL-PRF-27404.

MMH is a hydrazine derivative that was once used in the orbital maneuvering system (OMS) and reaction control system (RCS) engines of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle, which used MMH and MON-3 (a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide). This chemical is toxic and carcinogenic, but it is easily stored in orbit, providing moderate performance for very low fuel tank system weight. MMH and its chemical relative unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) have a key advantage that they are stable enough to be used in regeneratively cooled rocket engines. The European Space Agency (ESA) has attempted to seek new options in terms of bipropellant rocket combinations to avoid using deadly chemicals such as MMH and its relatives.

MMH is believed to be the primary active mycotoxin found in mushrooms of the genus &quot;Gyromitra&quot;, especially the false morel (&quot;Gyromitra esculenta&quot;). In these cases, MMH is formed by the hydrolysis of gyromitrin.

Monomethylhydrazine is considered to be a possible occupational carcinogen, and the occupational exposure limits to MMH are set at protective levels to account for the possible carcinogenicity.

A known use of MMH is in the synthesis of suritozole.

MMH is also assumed to be the active methylating agent in the drug Temozolomide.
