<text>San Diego International Airport is the primary international airport serving San Diego and its surrounding metropolitan area, in the U.S. state of California. The airport is located northwest of downtown San Diego. It covers of land and is the third busiest airport in California in terms of passenger traffic. It is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States.

The airport is owned and operated by the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. It operates in controlled airspace served by Southern California TRACON. The airport&#x27;s landing approach is close to the skyscrapers of downtown San Diego, and can sometimes prove difficult to pilots due to the relatively short usable landing area, steep descent angle over the crest of Bankers Hill, and shifting wind currents just before landing.

==History==
===Origins===
Prior to the development of the airport, the area was a delta river outlet for the San Diego River into San Diego Bay, which was then re routed to terminate to the Pacific Ocean parallel to Mission Bay.

The airport is near the site of the Ryan Airlines factory, but it is not the same as Dutch Flats Airport, the Ryan airfield where Charles Lindbergh flight-tested the Spirit of St. Louis before his historic 1927 transatlantic flight. The site of Dutch Flats is on the other side of Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, near the intersection of Midway and Barnett Avenues.

Inspired by Lindbergh&#x27;s flight and excited to have made his plane, the city of San Diego passed a bond issue in 1928 for the construction of a two-runway municipal airport. Lindbergh encouraged the building of the airport and agreed to lend his name to it. The new airport, dedicated on August 16, 1928, was San Diego Municipal Airport – Lindbergh Field, with 140 Navy and 82 Army planes involved in a flyover.

The airport was the first federally certified airfield to serve all aircraft types, including seaplanes. The original terminal was on the northeast side of the field, on Pacific Highway. The airport was also a testing facility for several early US sailplane designs, notably those by William Hawley Bowlus (superintendent of construction on the Spirit of St. Louis) who also operated the Bowlus Glider School at Lindbergh Field from 1929 to 1930. The airport was also the site of a national and world record for women&#x27;s altitude established in 1930 by Ruth Alexander. The airport was also the site of the first transcontinental glider tow by Capt. Frank Hawks departing Lindbergh Field on March 30, 1930, and ending in Van Cortland Park in New York City on April 6, 1930. On June 1, 1930, a regular San Diego–Los Angeles airmail route started. The airport gained international airport status in 1934. In April 1937, United States Coast Guard Air Base was commissioned next to the airfield. The Coast Guard&#x27;s fixed-wing aircraft used Lindbergh Field until the mid-1990s when their fixed-wing aircraft were assigned elsewhere.

A major defense contractor and contributor to World War II heavy bomber production, Consolidated Aircraft, later known as Convair, had their headquarters on the border of Lindbergh Field, and built many of their military aircraft there. Convair used the airport for test and delivery flights from 1935 to 1995.

The US Army Air Corps took over the field in 1942, improving it to handle the heavy bombers being manufactured in the region. Two camps were established at the airport during World War II and were named Camp Consair and Camp Sahara. This transformation, including an runway, made the airport &quot;jet-ready&quot; long before jet airliners came into service. The May 1952 C&amp;GS chart shows an 8,700-ft runway 9 and a 4,500-ft runway 13.

===Jet age===
Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) established its headquarters in San Diego and started service at Lindbergh Field in 1949. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 42 departures per day: 14 American, 13 United, 6 Western, 6 Bonanza, and 3 PSA (5 PSA on Friday and Sunday). American had a nonstop flight to Dallas and one to El Paso; aside from that, nonstop flights did not reach beyond California and Arizona. The first scheduled flights using jets at Lindbergh Field were in September 1960: American Airlines Boeing 720s to Phoenix and United Airlines 720s to San Francisco. Nonstop flights to Chicago started in 1962 and to New York in 1967.

The airport was built and operated by the City of San Diego through the sale of municipal bonds to be repaid by airport users. In 1962 it was transferred to the San Diego Unified Port District by a state law. The original terminal was on the north side of the airport; the current Terminal 1 opened on the south side of the airport on March 5, 1967. Originally Terminal 1 was only 1 story tall and had no jet bridges, however between 1981 and 1983 Terminal 1 East was given a second floor and jet bridges, and the same was done with Terminal 1 West between 1989 and 1991. Terminal 2 also originally opened on July 11, 1979. These terminals were designed by Paderewski Dean &amp; Associates.

Western Airlines discontinued service to Mexico City in 1981, leaving the airport without any international flights. However, in June 1988, the airport&#x27;s first transatlantic flight was opened, a British Airways flight to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport using Boeing 747s and McDonnell Douglas DC-10s. As San Diego airport&#x27;s customs facility had not been used in seven years and was not up to the US Customs Service&#x27;s latest security requirements, inbound travelers had to clear customs in Los Angeles, which made the journey cumbersome. After the Port District performed the necessary upgrades, San Diego Airport&#x27;s customs facility reopened in 1989 - nevertheless, British Airways ended the route in November 1990.

Between 1991 and 1993, the airport&#x27;s second runway (Runway 13/31) was closed and retrofitted into taxiways D and F. This runway had been much smaller than the main runway (Runway 9/27) and was unable to be used by commercial jets.

In July 1996, the Commuter Terminal opened, a small standalone facility where all short-haul flights to Los Angeles boarded regardless of airline. Terminal 2 itself was expanded westward by on January 7, 1998. The expanded Terminal 2 and the Commuter Terminal were designed by Gensler and SGPA Architecture and Planning.

In 2001, the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority (SDCRAA) was created by California State Assembly Bill 93. The SDCRAA assumed jurisdiction over the airport in December 2002. The Authority changed the airport&#x27;s name from Lindbergh Field to San Diego International Airport in 2003, reportedly considering the new name &quot;a better fit for a major commercial airport.&quot;

===Relocation proposals===
As far back as 1950, there have been proposals to relocate San Diego International Airport. In 1950, the city of San Diego acquired what is today Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport and much of the land surrounding it through eminent domain to build a replacement airport, but the Korean War brought with it a massive expansion in jet traffic to nearby Naval Air Station Miramar, which soon rendered a commercial service airport in the area impractical. The CAA refused to fund any major enhancements to SDIA through the 1950s, and at various times the city proposed NAS North Island, Mission Bay, and Brown Field as replacements. Cost, conflicts with the Navy, and potential interference with other air traffic stymied these plans.

While in 1964 the FAA finally agreed to an expansion of SDIA, which led to the construction of today&#x27;s Terminal 1, it was only allowed with the assurance of San Diego Mayor Charles Dail that it would be a temporary measure until a replacement airport could be found. From that time until 2006, various public agencies conducted studies on potential locations for a replacement airport. One revisited a study done in the 1980s by the City in 1994 when Naval Air Station Miramar closed and was then immediately transferred to the US Marine Corps as Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. Another was by the City of San Diego in 1984 and another that started in 1996 and sat dormant with SANDAG until the airport authority was formed.

In 2001, the SDCRAA projected SAN would be constrained by congestion between 2015 and 2022; the Great Recession, however, extended the forecast capacity limitations into the 2030s. In June 2006, SDCRAA board members selected Marine Corps Air Station Miramar as its preferred site for a replacement airport, despite military objections the compromises this would require would severely interfere with the readiness and training of aviators stationed at the air station. On November 7, 2006, San Diego County residents rejected an advisory relocation ballot that included a joint use proposal measure over these and related concerns over the potential impact reducing the region&#x27;s military value would have on the defense-focused San Diego economy. With the relocation proposals now defeated, San Diego Airport began looking to improve its existing facilities.

===Modern expansion===

The first of San Diego International Airport&#x27;s expansions in the 21st century was &quot;The Green Build,&quot; an expansion to Terminal 2 West that added 10 gates, a new security area, an expanded concession area (&quot;Sunset Cove&quot;), and a dual-level arrivals/departures roadway. It was completed on August 13, 2013, and cost US$900 million. In January 2016, the airport opened a new consolidated rental car facility on the airport&#x27;s north side. The US$316 million, facility houses 14 rental car companies and is served by shuttle buses to and from the terminals. A new three-story parking structure in front of Terminal 2 broke ground in July 2016 and completed in May 2018.

Due to the sharp rise of international travel at the airport, with traffic at international arrival gates 20, 21 and 22 increasing &quot;from 50,000 passengers a year in 1990 to more than 400,000 a year in 2017,&quot; a new immigration and customs facility at Terminal 2 West began construction in 2017. The new facility was partially built into the now-four year old Green Build, adding a new upper level and vertical cores to move passengers from existing Green Build gates (46, 47, 48, 49, 50, and 51) to 55,000 square feet of new international arrivals facilities at the southwest corner of the terminal. The facility was completed in June 2018 and is almost five times the size of its predecessor. Currently, the airport serves non-stop flights to six countries: Japan, Germany, the UK, Mexico, Canada, and soon the Netherlands.

In 2021, the airport began construction on a complete replacement of Terminal 1, as per the Airport Development Plan (ADP), a study by the airport that began in 2016.

The new Terminal 1&#x27;s construction is split into two phases. The first phase consists of a new 19-gate standalone facility east of the original Terminal 1, as well as a new 7,500-space parking structure, a new dual-level arrivals/departures roadway to match Terminal 2&#x27;s, a new entry road parallel to Harbor Drive, and an expanded aircraft taxiway A to pair with existing taxiway B. This first phase is scheduled to open in 2025 with a budget of US$2.6 billion, and is 60% complete as of April 4, 2024. The second phase, planned to open in 2028, will demolish the original Terminal 1 and replace it with 11 additional gates for the new Terminal 1. Space was also set aside west of the new parking structure for an unspecified rail transit station to connect the Airport to downtown San Diego, although neither constructing this station nor constructing tracks leading to it are the responsibility of the airport.

2016&#x27;s ADP also planned for a new airport operations center to replace the one located within the long-decommissioned and now-demolished Commuter Terminal. This was completed in December 2023. A further westward expansion to Terminal 2 West was also called for in the ADP, which would increase the total number of gates at the airport to 61. While the airport may decide to move forward with this third phase at some point, it is not expected to be completed before 2035 at the earliest.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===
San Diego International Airport has two terminals and 51 gates:
* Terminal 1 has two concourses (East and West). The terminal currently has 14 gates (5-18), Five gates (1, 1A, 2, 3 and 4) were demolished by early 2022, to make room for the construction of the New T1 project.
* Terminal 2 has two concourses (East and West), 32 gates, and four lounges (Aspire Lounge, Chase Sapphire Lounge by The Club, Delta Sky Club, United Club).

===Runway===

The airport has one runway, designated 09/27 for its magnetic headings of 095 degrees (106 True) and 275 degrees (286 True). The runway, built of asphalt and concrete, measures . Each end has a displaced threshold: on Runway 27, the first are displaced, while the first are displaced on Runway 9. The west end of the runway has an Engineered materials arrestor system, installed in 2006 and expanded in 2021.

Westerly winds predominate, so most takeoffs and landings use Runway 27. However, when in marine layer or Santa Ana wind conditions, the runway configuration reverses to Runway 9, usually causing delays. Delays are exacerbated by some heavier planes being unable to takeoff on Runway 9, necessitating these specific planes to wait at the end of Runway 27 for sometimes multiple hours until their opposite-direction takeoff can be fit in.

The approach to Runway 27 is unusually steep due to utility poles and buildings over tall that are located within of the east end of the runway. Nearby skyscrapers are no factor, but nevertheless the approach has gained notoriety among passengers for the unusual experience of flying relatively low and close to San Diego&#x27;s densely populated downtown, and has drawn comparisons to Kansas City&#x27;s Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport and Hong Kong&#x27;s former Kai Tak Airport. From the left side of the aircraft, the approach offers closeup views of skyscrapers, Petco Park (home of the San Diego Padres), San Diego Bay, and the San Diego–Coronado Bridge, while Balboa Park, site of the 1915–1916 Panama–California Exposition, can be seen on the right. Contrary to local lore, the parking garage located from the east of the end of the runway was built in the 1980slong after previous obstructions also on the east side of I-5 were builtand does not affect the approach.

To appease the concerns of the airport&#x27;s neighbors regarding noise and to head off any ensuing lawsuits, a curfew was implemented in 1979 whereby takeoffs are only allowed between 6:30 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. Outside these hours, they are subject to a large fine. However, law enforcement, emergency, fire or rescue aircraft, and medical flights can operate normally. Arrivals are permitted 24 hours per day. While several flights have scheduled departure times before 6:30 a.m., these are pushback times, and the first takeoff roll does not occur until 6:30 a.m.

===Ground transportation===
The airport is on North Harbor Drive, which is accessible from Interstate 5 northbound via the Hawthorn Street exit and southbound via the Sassafras Street exit. Short-term parking is located in front of both terminals: Terminal 2 has covered parking plaza and an outdoor lot, while Terminal 1 only has an outdoor lot. Long term parking is on North Harbor Drive to the east of the terminals and is served by shuttle buses.

Both terminals have designated areas for taxis and ride-share pickups.

=== Public transportation ===
There are four public transportation options:
* Metropolitan Transit System Route 992: operates between downtown San Diego, Terminal 1, Terminal 2 East, and Terminal 2 West. Route 992 operates from 5 a.m. to 12:45 a.m. with buses arriving every 15 minutes. Route 992 connects to several major transportation hubs in downtown San Diego:
** Santa Fe Depot served by Amtrak, Coaster, the Blue and Green lines of the San Diego Trolley, and Rapid buses
** City College station served by the Blue and Orange lines of the San Diego Trolley, and Rapid buses
* Metropolitan Transit System Route 923: operates between Ocean Beach and Downtown San Diego, stopping just outside the airport on North Harbor Drive from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. every 30 minutes on weekdays. Service does not operate on weekends.
*TERMINAL → TROLLEY shuttle: buses serving the rental car center make a stop at the corner of Admiral Boland Way and West Palm Street, one block (about ) from Middletown station served by the Blue and Green lines of the San Diego Trolley.
*San Diego Flyer shuttle: complimentary buses operate between the airport and Old Town Transit Center every 20 to 30 minutes. Pickup and drop-offs are timed to meet the first and last Trolley, Coasters, Amtrak trains, and MTS buses. Passengers can transfer via Old Town Transit Center to Amtrak, Coaster, along with Blue and Green lines trains of the San Diego Trolley.
Extension of the San Diego Trolley to directly serve the airport terminals, has been proposed several times but has not yet come to fruition. A 2021 study has found that such an extension to the airport is feasible and could be completed within ten years.

===Military===
Coast Guard Air Station San Diego is near the southeast corner of the airport. The installation originally supported seaplane operations during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, when the station had HU-25 Guardian jets assigned.

===Airline Support Building===
The Airline Support Building, which houses cargo operations and storage areas for aircraft provisions, and serves as a pick up and drop off point for live animals and large cargo, opened on July 20, 2021. Located on the south side of the airfield along North Harbor Drive, the building counts among its cargo tenants Alaska Airlines, American, Delta, Hawaiian, Lufthansa, Southwest, Sun Country, and United. The design-build project to construct the facility was awarded to SUNDT construction in 2018 for approximately $130 million.

===Other facilities===
Signature Aviation is the fixed-base operator (FBO) at San Diego International Airport. The FBO ramp is at the northeast end of the airfield.

Stormwater is captured on Terminal 2 Parking Plaza and used in the cooling towers that heat, ventilate and air condition the terminals and jet bridges.

A portion of the southeast infield at San Diego International Airport is set aside as a nesting site for the endangered California least tern. April through September is the least tern nesting season at SAN. Since 1970, this endangered migratory sea bird has found a suitable nesting site each year in the sand and gravel located in four oval areas between the runway and airplane taxiway. Approximately 135 nests were established there in 2007.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On April 29, 1929, a Ford Trimotor operated by Maddux Air Lines collided in mid-air with a PW-9D shortly after taking off from Lindbergh Field. The aircraft collided over downtown San Diego, killing all five aboard the Trimotor and the USAAC pilot of PW-9D. According to eyewitness accounts, shortly before the collision the Air Corps pilot had been flying extremely close to the larger airliner in an impromptu show for viewers on the ground, when he misjudged the distance between the two aircraft and crashed into it.
*On June 2, 1941, the first British Consolidated LB-30 Liberator II, &quot;AL503&quot;, on its acceptance flight for delivery from the Consolidated Aircraft Company plant in San Diego, crashed into San Diego Bay when the flight controls froze, killing all five of the civilian crew: Consolidated Aircraft Company&#x27;s chief test pilot William Wheatley, co-pilot Alan Austen, flight engineer Bruce Kilpatrick Craig, and two chief mechanics, Lewis McCannon and William Reiser. Craig had been commissioned a 2nd lieutenant in the US Army Reserve in 1935 following Infantry ROTC training at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering. He had applied for a commission in the US Army Air Corps before his death; this was granted posthumously, with the rank of 2nd lieutenant. On August 25, 1941, the airfield in his hometown of Selma, Alabama was renamed Craig Field, later Craig Air Force Base. Investigation into the cause of the accident caused a two-month delay in deliveries, resulting in the Royal Air Force not receiving Liberator IIs until August 1941.
*On May 10, 1943, the first Consolidated XB-32 Dominator, &quot;41–141&quot;, crashed on take-off at Lindbergh Field, likely from failure of the flaps. Although the bomber did not burn when it piled up at the end of the runway, Consolidated&#x27;s senior test pilot Dick McMakin was killed. Six others on board were injured. This was one of only two twin-finned B-32s (&quot;41–142&quot; was the other); all subsequent planes had a PB4Y-style single tail.
*On November 22, 1944, Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, BuNo &quot;59544&quot;, on a pre-delivery test flight from Lindbergh Field, took off at 12:23 am, lost its left outer wing on climb-out, and crashed in a ravine in an undeveloped area of Loma Portal near the Naval Training Center, less than from the runway. All six members of the Consolidated Vultee test crew were killed, including pilot Marvin R. Weller, co-pilot Conrad C. Cappe, flight engineers Frank D. Sands and Clifford P. Bengston, radio operator Robert B. Skala, and Consolidated Vultee field operations employee Ray Estes. A wing panel landed on a home at 3121 Kingsley Street in Loma Portal. The cause was found to be 98 missing bolts; the wing was only attached with four spar bolts. Four employees who either were responsible for installation, or were inspectors who signed off on the undone work, were fired two days later. A San Diego coroner&#x27;s jury found Consolidated Vultee guilty of &quot;gross negligence&quot; by vote of 11–1 on January 5, 1945, and the Bureau of Aeronautics reduced its contract by one at a cost to firm of US$155,000. Consolidated Vultee paid out US$130,484 to the families of the six dead crew.
*On April 5, 1945, the prototype Ryan XFR-1 Fireball, BuNo &quot;48234&quot;, on a test flight over Lindbergh Field, lost skin between the front and rear spars of the right wing, interrupting airflow over the wing and causing it to break apart. Ryan test pilot Dean Lake bailed out as the airframe disintegrated. The wreckage struck a brand new Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, BuNo &quot;59836&quot;, just accepted by the US Navy and preparing to depart for the modification center at Litchfield Park, Arizona. The bomber caught fire and the four man Navy crew was forced to evacuate the burning PB4Y, with aviation machinist J. H. Randall suffering first, second, and third degree burns and minor lacerations while the rest of the crew was uninjured.
*On April 30, 1945, just before midnight, the first production Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer, BuNo &quot;59359&quot;, was being prepared on the ramp at Lindbergh Field for a flight to Naval Air Station Twin Cities in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A mechanic attempted to remove the left battery solenoid, located below the cockpit floor, but did so without disconnecting the battery. A ratchet wrench accidentally punctured a hydraulic line above the battery and the fluid ignited, setting the entire aircraft alight. The mechanic suffered severe burns. Only the number four (outer right) engine was deemed salvageable. The cause was an unqualified mechanic attempting a task that only a qualified electrician should perform.
*On August 5, 1952, Convair B-36D-25-CF Peacemaker, &quot;49-2661&quot;, returning from a pre-delivery test after being modified for the San-San project, suffered an uncontrollable engine fire in the right wing while attempting to land at Lindbergh Field. The #4 and #5 engines fell off the aircraft as the Convair test crew steered the crippled bomber towards the ocean. Seven of the eight crew on board bailed out, with Pilot David H. Franks heroically electing to stay with the aircraft to prevent it turning back towards the heavily populated coast, but flight engineer W.W. Hoffman drowned before he could be rescued. A USAF accident investigation was inconclusive, with a failure in the #5 engine&#x27;s alternator, supercharger, fuel or exhaust systems suggested as possible causes.
*On July 15, 1953, the prototype Convair XP5Y-1 Tradewind seaplane, BuNo &quot;121455&quot;, on a test flight off Point Loma after taking off from the water next to Lindbergh Field, fractured an elevator torque tube rendering the aircraft uncontrollable. All nine on board bailed out safely and were rescued.
*On November 4, 1954, an experimental Convair YF2Y Sea Dart seaplane, BuNo &quot;135762&quot;, on a demonstration flight for Navy officials over San Diego Bay after taking off from the water next to Lindbergh Field, disintegrated in mid-air after its pilot inadvertently exceeded the airframe&#x27;s structural limits. Convair test pilot Charles E. Richbourg was pulled from the water but did not survive.
*On September 25, 1978, a Boeing 727-200 operating flight PSA Flight 182 on the Sacramento–Los Angeles–San Diego route collided in mid-air with a Cessna 172 while attempting to land at San Diego Airport. The two aircraft collided over San Diego&#x27;s North Park neighborhood, killing all 135 people on Flight 182, the two people in the Cessna, and seven people on the ground. An NTSB accident investigation found the probable accident&#x27;s cause was the PSA flight crew&#x27;s failure to inform the tower they had lost sight of the Cessna, in contradiction to air traffic control instructions to &quot;keep visual separation&quot; from the smaller aircraft. Other factors named were errors on the part of ATC, including the use of pilot-maintained visual separation when ATC-monitored radar clearances were available, and an unexpected turn by the Cessna that put it directly in the path of the 727.
*On August 11, 2023, Southwest Airlines Flight 2493 and a Cessna Citation V business jet nearly collided, but this was avoided when the Cessna aborted its landing and passed over the Southwest plane waiting to depart by 100 feet. There were no injuries.

<text>Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport is an international airport under Class B airspace in Kenner city, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is owned by the city of New Orleans and is west of downtown New Orleans. A small portion of Runway 11/29 is in unincorporated St. Charles Parish. Armstrong International is the primary commercial airport for the New Orleans metropolitan area and southeast Louisiana. Nonstop service to some sixty destinations is provided, including flights to Europe, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean.

MSY covers 1,500 acres (607 ha) of land and contains two runways and two helipads. At an average of above sea level, MSY is the third lowest-lying international airport in the world, only behind Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands, which is below sea level, and Atyrau International Airport in Kazakhstan, which lies 72 feet (22 m) below sea level.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Plans for a new airport began in 1940, as evidence mounted that the older Shushan Airport (New Orleans Lakefront Airport) was too small.

The airport was originally named Moisant Field after daredevil aviator John Moisant, who died in 1910 in an airplane crash on agricultural land where the airport is now located. Its IATA code MSY was derived from Moisant Stock Yards, as Lakefront Airport retained the code NEW. In World War II the land became a government air base. It returned to civil control after the war and commercial service commenced in May 1946. In September 1947, the airport was shut down as it was submerged under two feet of water in the wake of the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane&#x27;s impact.

When commercial service began at Moisant Field in 1946, the terminal occupied a large, makeshift hangar-like building. A new terminal complex debuted in 1959 towards the end of Mayor DeLesseps &quot;Chep&quot; Morrison&#x27;s administration. This structure, greatly expanded in the 1970s and the recipient of two rebuilt concourses in the 1990s and 2000s, comprised the passenger terminal until its replacement with the new North Terminal in November 2019. The former terminal contained two sections, East and West, connected by a central ticketing alley and baggage claim. Four concourses, A, B, C and D, were attached to the terminal, which eventually grew to a total of 47 gates. The vaulted arrivals lounge at the head of Concourse C and the adjacent, western half of the ticketing alley are the remaining portions of the airport&#x27;s 1959 terminal complex.

Retired United States Air Force Major General Junius Wallace Jones served as airport director in the 1950s. During his term, a period of rapid change in civil aviation, the airport received many improvements. By the time the airport&#x27;s 1959 terminal building opened, the name &quot;Moisant International Airport&quot; was being used for the New Orleans facility. In 1961, the name was changed to &quot;New Orleans International Airport&quot;. The airport&#x27;s mid-1970s expansion included a lengthened main terminal ticketing area, an airport access road linking the terminal to Interstate 10, and the construction of Concourses A and B. The two original 1959 concourses were renamed Concourse C and Concourse D, with the latter receiving a four-gate addition at its terminus, designed to accommodate widebody aircraft.

In July 1978, National Airlines began flights to Amsterdam with continuing same-plane service to Frankfurt utilizing widebody McDonnell Douglas DC-10s. This was New Orleans&#x27; first nonstop transatlantic flight. Less than a month later, National added a stop in Tampa due to low demand. In May 1981, British Airways inaugurated a flight from London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport to Mexico City that stopped in New Orleans. It flew a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar on the route. The airline, then government-owned, discontinued the service in October 1982 because of its deepening financial problems.

Northeastern International Airways operated a small hub at MSY in the spring of 1984. Another airline that attempted to operate a hub at MSY was short-lived Pride Air which was based in New Orleans and was operating nonstop or direct Boeing 727 service from the airport to sixteen destinations, including cities in California, Florida, and the western U.S., in the summer of 1985.

In July 2001, to honor the 100th anniversary of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s birth (August 4, 1901), the airport&#x27;s name became &quot;Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport&quot;.

===Post-Katrina Recovery and Debut of New Terminal===
MSY reopened to commercial flights on September 13, 2005, after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina the previous month, with four flights operated by Delta Air Lines to Atlanta and a Northwest Airlines flight to Memphis. Slowly, service from other carriers began to resume. All international service into MSY was suspended while the FIS facility was closed post-Katrina. This facility was reopened in time to accommodate chartered flights arriving from London, Manchester, Bournemouth, and Nottingham (UK) carrying tourists arriving for the 2006 Mardi Gras and set to depart from the Port of New Orleans aboard a cruise liner.

MSY served 9,785,394 passengers in 2014, exceeding for the first time in the post-Katrina era the total passenger count of 9,733,179 achieved in 2004, the last full calendar year prior to Katrina&#x27;s landfall in August 2005. A new record passenger count was set by the airport in 2015. 10,673,301 passengers were served, eclipsing the earlier record of 9.9 million passengers, set in 2000. In 2019 the airport served 13.1 million passengers. 

In December 2015, the New Orleans Aviation Board, along with New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and the City Council, approved a plan to build a new $598 million terminal building on the north side of the airport property with two concourses and 30 gates. Designed by Argentine-American architect Cesar Pelli, construction on the new main terminal began in January 2016. During the construction, the scope of the project was expanded so the terminal would feature 35 gates. In March 2017, British Airways resumed flying to MSY, commencing nonstop service to London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport using Boeing 787 widebody aircraft. Significantly, given Heathrow&#x27;s superb international service, nonstop flights connecting New Orleans with London Heathrow mean that every major destination in the world may be reached from New Orleans in no more than two flights.

The new terminal opened in November 2019 at a cost of $1.3 billion. The former terminal, located on the south side of the airfield, is no longer in regular commercial use.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===

MSY has a single terminal with three concourses labeled A, B, and C. There are a total of 35 gates. Departures and Ticketing are on Level 3, TSA Security Screening is on Level 2, and Arrivals and Baggage Claim are on Level 1. International flights are processed in Concourse A, which contains the airport&#x27;s customs facilities.

===Ground transportation===
The terminal is served by I-10. Bus service between the airport and downtown New Orleans is provided by New Orleans Regional Transit Authority Airport Express Route 202 and Jefferson Transit bus E-2. Airport Shuttle has services to most hotels and hostels in the Central Business District of New Orleans. The rental car facility is on the south side of the airfield next to the former terminal.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On November 16, 1959 National Airlines Flight 967, a Douglas DC-7 flying from Tampa to New Orleans crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. All 42 passengers and crew were killed.
* On February 25, 1964, Eastern Air Lines Flight 304 operated with a Douglas DC-8 flying from New Orleans International Airport to Washington Dulles International Airport crashed nine minutes after takeoff. All 51 passengers and 7 crew members were killed.
* On March 30, 1967, Delta Air Lines Flight 9877, a Douglas DC-8-51, a training exercise with 6 crew members aboard, crashed on approach to MSY at 12:50 AM Central Time Zone after simulating a two-engine out approach, resulting in a loss of control. All 6 crewmembers and 13 on the ground were killed. The DC-8 crashed into a residential area, destroying several homes and a motel complex.
* On March 20, 1969, Douglas DC-3 N142D, leased from Avion Airways for a private charter, crashed on landing, killing 16 of the 27 passengers and crew members on board. The aircraft was operating a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight from Memphis International Airport, Tennessee.
* On July 9, 1982, Pan Am Flight 759, en route from Miami to San Diego, departed New Orleans International on its way to a second stop-over at Las Vegas. The Boeing 727-200 jetliner took off from the east–west runway (Runway 10/28) traveling east but never gained an altitude higher than . The aircraft traveled 4,610 feet (1405 m) beyond the end of Runway 10, hitting trees along the way, until crashing into a residential neighborhood. A total of 153 people were killed (all 145 on board and 8 on the ground). The crash was, at the time, the second-deadliest civil aviation disaster in U.S. history. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause was the aircraft&#x27;s encounter with a microburst-induced wind shear during the liftoff. This atmospheric condition created a downdraft and decreasing headwind forcing the plane downward. Modern wind shear detection equipment protecting flights from such conditions is now in place both onboard planes and at most commercial airports, including Armstrong International.
* On May 24, 1988, TACA Flight 110 was forced to glide without power and make an emergency landing on top of a levee east of New Orleans International Airport after flame-out in both engines of the Boeing 737-300 in a severe thunderstorm. There were no casualties and the aircraft was subsequently repaired and returned to service.
*On April 4, 2011, United Airlines Flight 497 en route from New Orleans to San Francisco made an emergency landing back at New Orleans after the flight crew reported smoke on board. The aircraft excursed from the runway during landing, sustaining minor damage. All 109 people on board evacuated the aircraft with no injuries. The NTSB determined that the captain had failed to properly manage the warning about smoke, which was actually erroneous and had been caused by contamination. No smoke was found on board the aircraft.

<doc id="263656" wikidata="Q2884546" url="?curid=263656" title="Tuna salad">
<text>Tuna salad is a salad dish consisting of tuna and mayonnaise. The tuna used is usually pre-cooked, canned, and packaged in water or oil. Pickles, celery, relish, and onion are popular ingredients to add. Tuna salad is used to make tuna fish sandwiches; it can also be served on top of crackers, lettuce, tomato, or avocado (or else served by itself).
==History==
Tuna salad has been eaten for over 100 years. The first written reference to tuna salad, in Russia, appeared in 1876, and by 1893, dozens of recipes had been published. Tuna salad, especially with celery, is similar to chicken salad while also being more convenient (due to the use of canned tuna), a fact that helped its early rise in popularity.

Due to the high nutritional content of tuna salad, it assumed the reputation of a diet food in the 1960s.

==Dishes==

In the United States, tuna salad is often considered its own dish. However, it may be added to noodles with its standard ingredients (onions, mayonnaise, and celery) to make a tuna pasta salad. Tuna salad is also commonly seen in American salad bars.

In Belgium, the dish &quot;pêches au thon&quot;/&quot;perziken met tonijn&quot; (&#x27;peaches with tuna&#x27;) is made from halved canned or fresh peaches stuffed with tuna salad. It is widespread throughout the country, and, due to its ease of preparation, it is common fare at potlucks.

<doc id="263657" wikidata="Q2453329" url="?curid=263657" title="Trillium Book Award">
<text>The Trillium Book Award ( or Prix Trillium) is an annual literary award presented to writers in Ontario, Canada. It is administered by Ontario Creates, a Crown agency of the Government of Ontario, which is overseen by the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries. The monetary component for the award includes amounts paid to the author of the book and to the publisher of the book. The award has been expanded several times since its establishment in 1987: a separate award for French-language literature was added in 1994, an award for poetry in each language was added in 2003, and an award for French-language children&#x27;s literature was added in 2006.

==History==

The Trillium Book Award was created for three reasons: 
*to recognize a book of literary excellence which furthers the understanding of Ontarians and Ontario society; 
*to assist Ontario’s publishing industry; and, 
*to bring Ontario’s public library and writing communities closer together.

The Trillium Award was one of several creative initiatives undertaken by the Libraries and Community Information Branch while under the direction of Wil Vanderelst during the 1980s, that encouraged the development of Ontario writers and the distribution of their works. When created in 1987 the Trillium Book Award/Prix Trillium was the richest book award in Canada with a cash prize of $10,000 to the winner. It was also unique in that a separate $2000 would go to the publisher of the winning book to assist in its marketing and promotion. Under the auspices of the Libraries Branch, both the shortlisted books and the finalist were marketed through a unique logo for the prize, posters, bookmarks as well as an aggressive six-week media campaign targeting both bookstores as well as public libraries. (The prize today is $20,000 for the writer with $2,500 for the publisher, and $10,000/$2000 for the poetry prize.)

The first jury was bilingual and selected seven nominees for the book award. Books in both languages were considered, as were poetry, fiction, and non-fiction books. The members of the first jury were Joyce Marshall, novelist and translator; Pierre Levesque, an Ottawa bookseller and specialist in French Canadian books; Grace Buller, retired librarian and former editor of &quot;Ontario Library Review&quot; (of Books); William Eccles, historian and Professor Emeritus; and Wayne Grady, anthologist, critic, translator, and former editor of Harrowsmith.

The Trillium Book Award met with considerable approval from newspaper book editors at the time of the first award in 1988. While some critics did not like a judged competition involving personal taste in reading the material, the benefits of the award in assisting the marketing of Canadian books was thought more important. The Writers’ Union led at that time by the writer Matt Cohen met with Wil Vanderelst and strongly supported both programs given cutbacks in support for arts organizations at the federal level. Through reprioritizing, the public libraries budget these programs continued – although the writers in libraries program was eventually eliminated as part of the province’s budgetary restrictions. The Trillium Book Award managed to avoid the budgetary ax only through the personal support of the then Premier, Bob Rae. He is the only Premier of Ontario who has attended the presentation program of the award.

==Awards and eligibility==

The Trillium Award is open to books in any genre: fiction, non-fiction, drama, children&#x27;s books, and poetry. Anthologies, new editions, re-issues and translations are not eligible. Electronic and self-published books are also ineligible. Three jury members per language judge the submissions, select the shortlist and the winning title. The jury is composed of writers and other members of the literary community.

Canadian citizens and landed immigrants who have lived in Ontario for at least three out of the past five years and who have been published anywhere in the world are eligible. Their publishers are invited to submit titles to the Ministry of Culture for consideration. In 1993 the award was expanded by Premier Bob Rae&#x27;s government to also include a French-language category; it was first awarded in 1994.

In 2003, new English and French poetry categories were added to the awards. The following year, however, due to the smaller number of French-language titles published in Ontario there were not enough French poetry submissions to present an award; accordingly, the French section is now divided into poetry and children&#x27;s literature awards presented in alternating years, with each award having an eligibility period of two years rather than one. The English poetry award continues to be presented yearly, and an English children&#x27;s literature award is not presented; however, English children&#x27;s books are eligible to be nominated for the English fiction award.

==Winners and nominees==
From 1987 to 1993, when only a single award was presented irrespective of language or literary genre, winners and nominees are directly listed below. From 1994 on, please see Trillium Book Award, English and Trillium Book Award, French.

<doc id="263659" wikidata="Q1417058" url="?curid=263659" title="A20 line">
<text>The A20, or address line 20, is one of the electrical lines that make up the system bus of an x86-based computer system. The A20 line in particular is used to transmit the 21st bit on the address bus.

A microprocessor typically has a number of address lines equal to the base-two logarithm of the number of words in its physical address space. For example, a processor with 4 GB of byte-addressable physical space requires 32 lines (log2(4 GB) = log2(232 B) = 32), which are named A0 through A31. The lines are named after the zero-based number of the bit in the address that they are transmitting. The least significant bit is first and is therefore numbered bit 0 and signaled on line A0. A20 transmits bit 20 (the 21st bit) and becomes active once addresses reach 1 MB, or 220. 

== Overview ==

The Intel 8086, Intel 8088, and Intel 80186 processors had 20 address lines, numbered A0 to A19; with these, the processor can access 220 bytes, or 1 MB. Internal address registers of such processors only had 16 bits. To access a 20-bit address space, an external memory reference was made up of a 16-bit &quot;offset&quot; address added to a 16-bit &quot;segment&quot; number, shifted 4 bits to the left so as to produce a 20-bit physical address. The resulting address is equal to &quot;segment&quot; × 16 + &quot;offset&quot;. There are many combinations of segment and offset that produce the same 20-bit physical address. Therefore, there were various ways to address the same byte in memory. For example, here are four of the 4096 different segment:offset combinations, all referencing the byte whose physical address is (the last byte in 1 MB-memory space):
: 
: 

Referenced the last way, an increase of one in the offset yields , which is a proper address for the processor, but since it translates to the physical address (the first byte over 1 MB), the processor would need another address line for actual access to that byte. Since there is no such line on the 8086 line of processors, the 21st bit above, while set, gets dropped, causing the address to &quot;wrap around&quot; and to actually point to the physical address .

When IBM designed the IBM PC AT (1984) machine, it decided to use the new higher-performance Intel 80286 microprocessor. The 80286 could address up to 16 MB of system memory in protected mode. However, the CPU was supposed to emulate an 8086&#x27;s behavior in real mode, its startup mode, so that it could run operating systems and programs that were not written for protected mode. The 80286 did not force the A20 line to zero in real mode, however. Therefore, the combination would no longer point to the physical address , but to the address . As a result, programs relying on the address wrap around would no longer work. To remain compatible with such programs, IBM decided to correct the problem on the motherboard.

That was accomplished by inserting a logic gate on the A20 line between the processor and system bus, which got named &quot;Gate-A20&quot;. Gate-A20 can be enabled or disabled by software to allow or prevent the address bus from receiving a signal from A20. It is set to non-passing for the execution of older programs that rely on the wrap-around. At boot time, the BIOS first enables Gate-A20 when it counts and tests all of the system memory, and then disables it before transferring control to the operating system.

Originally, the logic gate was a gate connected to the Intel 8042 keyboard controller. Controlling it was a relatively slow process. Other methods have since been added to allow more efficient multitasking of programs that require this wrap-around with programs that access all of the system memory. There are multiple methods to control the A20 line.

Disconnecting A20 would not wrap &quot;all&quot; memory accesses above 1 MB, just those in the 1–2 MB, 3–4 MB, 5–6 MB, etc. ranges. Real-mode software cared only about the area slightly above 1 MB, so the Gate-A20 line was enough.

Enabling the Gate-A20 line is one of the first steps that a protected-mode x86 operating system does in the bootup process, often before control has been passed to the kernel from the bootstrap (in the case of Linux, for example).

Virtual 8086 mode, introduced with the Intel 80386, allows the A20 wrap-around to be simulated by using the virtual memory facilities of the processor; physical memory may be mapped to multiple virtual addresses. Thus, the memory mapped at the first megabyte of virtual memory may be mapped again in the second megabyte of virtual memory. The operating system may intercept changes to Gate A20 and make corresponding changes to the virtual-memory address space, which also makes irrelevant the efficiency of Gate-A20 line toggling.

==A20 gate==
Controlling the A20 line was an important feature at one stage in the growth of the IBM PC architecture, as it added access to an additional 65,520 bytes (64 KB − 16 bytes) of memory in real mode, without significant software changes.

In what was arguably a &quot;hack&quot;, the A20 gate was originally part of the keyboard controller on the motherboard, which could open or close it depending on what behavior was desired.

In order to keep full compatibility with the Intel 8086, the A20 gate was still present in Intel CPUs until 2008. As the gate was initially closed right after boot, protected-mode operating systems typically opened the A20 gate early during the boot process to never close it again. Such operating systems had no compatibility reasons for keeping it closed, and they gained access to the full range of physical addresses available by opening it.

The Intel 80486 and Pentium added a special pin named &quot;A20M#&quot;, which when asserted low forces bit 20 of the physical address to be zero for all on-chip cache- or external-memory accesses. It was necessary, since the 80486 introduced an on-chip cache and so masking this bit in external logic was no longer possible. Software still needs to manipulate the gate and must still deal with external peripherals (the chipset) for that.

The PC System Design Guide PC 2001 removes compatibility for the A20 line: &quot;If A20M# generation logic is still present in the system, this logic must be terminated such that software writes to I/O port 92, bit 1, do not result in A20M# being asserted to the processor.&quot;

Support for the A20 gate was changed in the Nehalem microarchitecture (some sources incorrectly claim that A20 support was removed). Rather than the CPU having a dedicated A20M# pin that receives the signal whether or not to mask the A20 bit, it has been virtualized so that the information is sent from the peripheral hardware to the CPU using special bus cycles. From a software point of view, the mechanism works exactly as before, and an operating system must still program external hardware (which in-turn sends the aforementioned bus cycles to the CPU) to disable the A20 masking.

Intel no longer supports the A20 gate, starting with Haswell. Page 271 of the Intel System Programmers Manual Vol. 3A from June 2013 states: &quot;The functionality of A20M# is used primarily by older operating systems and not used by modern operating systems. On newer Intel 64 processors, A20M# may be absent.&quot;

==A20 handler==
The A20 handler is IBM PC memory manager software that controls access to the high memory area (HMA). Extended-memory managers usually provide this functionality. A20 handlers are named after the 21st address line of the microprocessor, the A20 line.

In DOS, HMA managers such as HIMEM.SYS have the &quot;extra task&quot; of managing A20. HIMEM.SYS provided an API for opening/closing A20. DOS itself could use the area for some of its storage needs, thereby freeing up more conventional memory for programs. That functionality was enabled by the codice_1 or codice_2 directives in the CONFIG.SYS configuration file.

==Affected programs==
Since 1980, the address wrap was internally used by 86-DOS and MS-DOS to implement the DOS CALL 5 entry point at offset +5 to +9 (which emulates the CP/M-80-style CALL 5 BDOS API entry point at offset +5 to +7) in the Program Segment Prefix (PSP) (which partially resembles CP/M-80&#x27;s zero page). This was, in particular, utilized by programs machine-translated from CP/M-80 through assembly language translators like Seattle Computer Products&#x27; TRANS86. The CALL 5 handler this entry point refers to resides at the machine&#x27;s physical address 0x000000C0 (thereby overlapping the four bytes of the interrupt service routine entry point reserved for INT 30h and the first byte of INT 31h in the x86 real mode interrupt vector table). However, by the design of CP/M-80, which loaded the operating system immediately above the memory available for the application program to run in, the 8080/Z80 16-bit target address stored at offset +6 to +7 in the zero page could deliberately also be interpreted as the size of the first memory segment. In order to emulate this in DOS with its 8086 segment:offset addressing scheme, the far call entry point&#x27;s 16-bit offset had to match this segment size (i.e. ), which is stored at offset +6 to +7 in the PSP, overlapping parts of the CALL 5. The only way to reconcile these requirements was to choose a segment value that, when added to , results in an address of , which, on an 8086, wraps around to .

A20 had to be disabled for the wraparound to occur and DOS programs using this interface to work. Newer DOS versions which can relocate parts of themselves into the HMA, typically craft a copy of the entry point at in the HMA (which again resolves to physical ), so that the interface can work without regard to the state of A20.

One program known to use the CALL 5 interface is the DOS version of the Small-C compiler. Also, the SPELL utility in Microsoft&#x27;s Word 3.0 (1987) is one of the programs depending on the CALL 5 interface to be set up correspondingly. Sun Microsystems&#x27; PC-NFS (1993) requires the CALL 5 fix-up as well.

Also, to save program space, a trick was used by some BIOS and DOS programmers, for example, to have one segment that has access to program data (such as from to , pointing to the physical addresses ), as well as the I/O data (such as the keyboard buffer) that was located in the first memory segment (with addresses to pointing to the physical addresses to ).

This trick works for as long as the code isn&#x27;t executed in low memory, the first 64 KB of RAM, a condition that was always true in older DOS versions without load-high capabilities.

With the DOS kernel relocated into higher memory areas, low memory increasingly became available for programs, causing those depending on the wraparound to fail. The executable loaders in newer versions of DOS attempt to detect some common types of affected programs and either patch them on-the-fly to function also in low memory or load them above the first 64 KB before passing execution on to them. For programs, which are not detected automatically, LOADFIX or MEMMAX -L can be used to force programs to be loaded above the first 64 KB.

The trick was utilized by IBM/Microsoft Pascal itself as well as by programs compiled with it, including Microsoft&#x27;s MASM. Other commonly used development utilities using this were executable compressors like Realia&#x27;s Spacemaker (written by Robert B. K. Dewar in 1982 and used to compress early versions of the Norton Utilities) and Microsoft&#x27;s EXEPACK (written by Reuben Borman in 1985) as well as the equivalent /E[XEPACK] option in Microsoft&#x27;s LINK 3.02 and higher. Programs processed with EXEPACK would display a &quot;Packed file is corrupt&quot; error message.

Various third-party utilities exist to modify compressed executables either replacing the problematic uncompression routine(s) through restubbing, or attempting to expand and restore the original file.

Modern Legacy BIOS boot loaders (such as GNU GRUB) use the A20 line. UEFI boot loaders use 32-bit protected mode or 64-bit long mode.

<doc id="263660" wikidata="Q1723225" url="?curid=263660" title="Circle of forces">
<text>The circle of forces, traction circle, friction circle, or friction ellipse is a useful way to think about the dynamic interaction between a vehicle&#x27;s tire and the road surface. The diagram below shows the tire from above, so that the road surface lies in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane. The vehicle to which the tire is attached is moving in the positive &quot;y&quot; direction.

In this example, the vehicle would be cornering to the right (i.e. the positive &quot;x&quot; direction points to the center of the corner). Note that the plane of rotation of the tire is at an angle to the actual direction that the tire is moving (the positive &quot;y&quot; direction). Put differently, rather than being allowed to simply &quot;roll&quot; in the direction that it is &quot;pointing&quot; (in this case, rightwards from the positive &quot;y&quot; direction), the tire instead must &quot;slip&quot; in a different direction from that which it is pointing in order to maintain its &quot;forward&quot; motion in the positive &quot;y&quot; direction. This difference between the direction the tire &quot;points&quot; (its plane of rotation) and the tire&#x27;s actual direction of travel is the slip angle.

A tire can generate horizontal force where it meets the road surface by the mechanism of slip. That force is represented in the diagram by the vector F. Note that in this example, F is perpendicular to the plane of the tire. That is because the tire is rolling freely, with no torque applied to it by the vehicle&#x27;s brakes or drive train. However, that is not always the case.

The magnitude of F is limited by the dashed circle, but it can be any combination of the components F&quot;x&quot; and F&quot;y&quot; that does not extend beyond the dashed circle. (For a real-world tire, the circle is likely to be closer to an ellipse, with the &quot;y&quot; axis slightly longer than the &quot;x&quot; axis.)

In the example, the tire is generating a component of force in the &quot;x&quot; direction (F&quot;x&quot;) which, when transferred to the vehicle&#x27;s chassis via the suspension system in combination with similar forces from the other tires, will cause the vehicle to turn to the right. Note that there is also a small component of force in the negative &quot;y&quot; direction (F&quot;y&quot;). This represents drag that will, if not countered by some other force, cause the vehicle to decelerate. Drag of this kind is an unavoidable consequence of the mechanism of slip, by which the tire generates lateral force.

The diameter of the circle of forces, and therefore the maximum horizontal force that the tire can generate, depends upon many factors, including the design of the tire and its condition (age and temperature, for example), the qualities of the road surface, and the vertical load on the tire.

<doc id="263662" wikidata="Q1424792" url="?curid=263662" title="Fox spirit">
<text>Huli jing () are Chinese mythological creatures usually capable of shapeshifting, who may either be benevolent or malevolent spirits. In Chinese mythology and folklore, the fox spirit takes variant forms with different meanings, powers, characteristics, and shapes, including &quot;huxian&quot; (), &quot;hushen&quot; (), &quot;husheng&quot; (), &quot;huwang&quot; (), &quot;huyao&quot; (), &quot;huzu&quot; (), and &quot;jiuweihu&quot; ().

Fox spirits and nine-tailed foxes appear frequently in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology. Depending on the story, the fox spirit&#x27;s presence may be a good or a bad omen. The motif of nine-tailed foxes from Chinese culture was eventually transmitted and introduced to Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese cultures.

==Descriptions==
The nine-tailed fox occurs in the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot; (&quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;), compiled from the Warring States period to the Western Han period (circa fourth to circa first century BC). The work states:

In chapter 14 of the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot;, Guo Pu, a scholar of the Eastern Jin dynasty, had commented that the &quot;nine-tailed fox was an auspicious omen that appeared during times of peace.&quot; However, in chapter 1, another aspect of the nine-tailed fox is described:

In one ancient myth, Yu the Great encountered a white nine-tailed fox, which he interpreted as an auspicious sign that he would marry Nüjiao. In Han iconography, the nine-tailed fox is sometimes depicted at Mount Kunlun and along with Xi Wangmu in her role as the goddess of immortality. According to the first-century &quot;Baihutong&quot; (&quot;Debates in the White Tiger Hall&quot;), the fox&#x27;s nine tails symbolize abundant progeny.

During the Han dynasty (202 BC – 9 AD; 25–220 AD), the development of ideas about interspecies transformation had taken place in Chinese culture. The idea that non-human creatures with advancing age could assume human form is presented in works such as the &quot;Lunheng&quot; by Wang Chong (27–91). As these traditions developed, the fox&#x27;s capacity for transformation was shaped.

Describing the transformation and other features of the fox, Guo Pu (276–324) made the following comment:
In &quot;Duìsúpiān&quot; (對俗篇) of the &quot;Baopuzi&quot;, it is written:
In a Tang Dynasty story, foxes could become humans by wearing a skull and worshipping the Big Dipper. They would try multiple skulls until they found one that fit without falling off.
The &quot;Youyang Zazu&quot; made a connection between nine-tailed foxes and the divine: 
The fox spirits encountered in tales and legends are usually females and appear as young, beautiful women. One of the most infamous fox spirits in Chinese mythology was Daji, who is portrayed in the Ming Dynasty shenmo novel &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot;. A beautiful daughter of a general, she was married forcibly to the cruel tyrant King Zhou of Shang. A nine-tailed fox spirit who served Nüwa, whom King Zhou had offended, entered into and possessed her body, expelling the true Daji&#x27;s soul. The spirit, as Daji, and her new husband schemed cruelly and invented many devices of torture, such as forcing righteous officials to hug red-hot metal pillars. Because of such cruelties, many people, including King Zhou&#x27;s own former generals, revolted and fought against the Shang dynasty. Finally, King Wen of Zhou, one of the vassals of Shang, founded a new dynasty named after his country. The fox spirit in Daji&#x27;s body was later driven out by Jiang Ziya, the first Prime Minister of the Zhou dynasty, and her spirit condemned by Nüwa herself for excessive cruelty.

==Traditions==
Popular fox worship during the Tang dynasty has been mentioned in a text entitled &quot;Hu Shen&quot; (Fox gods): 
In the Song dynasty, fox spirit cults, such as those dedicated to Daji, became outlawed, but their suppression was unsuccessful. For example, in 1111, an imperial edict was issued for the destruction of many spirit shrines within Kaifeng, including those of Daji.

On the eve of the Jurchen invasion, a fox went to the throne of Emperor Huizong of Song. So Huizong ordered the destruction of all fox temples in Kaifeng. The city was invaded the next day, and the dynasty fell after five months.

In late imperial China, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, disruptions in the domestic environment could be attributed to the mischief of fox spirits, which could throw or tear apart objects in a manner similar to a poltergeist. &quot;Hauntings&quot; by foxes were often regarded as both commonplace and essentially harmless, with one seventeenth-century author commenting that &quot;Out of every ten houses in the capital, six or seven have fox demons, but they do no harm and people are used to them&quot;.

Typically, fox spirits were seen as dangerous, but some of the stories in the Qing dynasty book &quot;Liaozhai Zhiyi&quot; by Pu Songling are love stories between a young human male and a fox appearing as a beautiful girl. In the fantasy novel &quot;The Three Sui Quash the Demons&#x27; Revolt&quot;, a huli jing teaches a young girl magic, enabling her to conjure armies with her spells.

Belief in fox spirits has also been implicated as an explanatory factor in the incidence of attacks of &quot;koro&quot;, a culture-bound syndrome found in southern China and Malaysia in particular.

There is mention of the fox spirit in Chinese Chán Buddhism, when Linji Yixuan compares them to voices that speak of the Dharma, stating &quot;the immature young monks, not understanding this, believe in these fox-spirits...&quot;

Fox spirits were thought to be able to disguise themselves as women. In this guise, they seduced young men who were scholars or merely intelligent to absorb &quot;life essence through their semen&quot;. This allowed them to actually turn into humans, then &quot;huxian&quot;, and then, after 1,000 years, a nine-tailed fox god which was able to navigate through higher realms of &quot;tiān&quot;.

A handful of &quot;Huli jing&quot; also appear in Wu Cheng&#x27;en&#x27;s late 16th-century novel, the Journey to the West:
* A brother-sister pair appear in the story arc covering the demon brothers, Golden-Horn and Silver-Horn, introduced as the demon brother&#x27;s venerable mother and maternal uncle, respectively.
* In the story arc covering Princess Iron Fan, it is revealed that Princess Iron Fan&#x27;s husband, the Bull Demon King, has left her for Princess Jade Countenance, a &quot;Huli jing&quot; demoness, who lured the Bull Demon King away from Princess Iron Fan with her massive dowry.
* In the story arc concerning Pilgrims while they are passing through the Kingdom of Biqiu, the &quot;White Deer Spirit&quot; and his adopted daughter, the &quot;White-Faced Vixen Spirit&quot; (also a &quot;Huli jing&quot; demoness), are plaguing the unwitting king, who had married the &quot;White-Faced Vixen Spirit&quot; while she posed as a mortal woman and the &quot;White Deer Spirit&quot; as her mortal father; the &quot;White-Faced Vixen Spirit&quot; is later slain by Zhu Bajie.

The fox cult survived in northern China in the 20th century, but was suppressed during the anti-superstition Socialist Education Campaign.

<doc id="263664" wikidata="Q29865" url="?curid=263664" title="Common goldeneye">
<text>The common goldeneye or simply goldeneye (Bucephala clangula) is a medium-sized sea duck of the genus &quot;Bucephala&quot;, the goldeneyes. Its closest relative is the similar Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;boukephalos&quot; (&quot;bullheaded&quot;, from &quot;bous&quot;, &quot;bull &quot; and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;), a reference to the bulbous head shape of the bufflehead. The species name is derived from the Latin &quot;clangere&quot; (&quot;to resound&quot;).

Common goldeneyes are aggressive and territorial ducks, and have elaborate courtship displays.

==Taxonomy==
The common goldeneye was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas clangula&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type location as Europe but in 1761 restricted this to Sweden. The common goldeneye is now one of three species placed in the genus &quot;Bucephala&quot; that was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;oukephalos&quot; meaning &quot;bullheaded&quot; or &quot;large-headed&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;clangere&quot; meaning &quot;to resound&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;B. c. clangula&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – subarctic from Scotland and Scandinavia to Sakhalin and Kamchatka Peninsula (southeast Russia), in south through north Kazakhstan, north Mongolia and Heilongjiang (northeast China)
* &quot;B. c. americana&quot; (Bonaparte, 1838) – subarctic from west Alaskan mainland to Labrador and New Brunswick, south through northern USA

==Description==
Adult males range from and weigh approximately , while females range from and weigh approximately . The common goldeneye has a wingspan of 77–83 cm (30–33 in). The species is named for its golden-yellow eyes. Adult males have a dark head with a greenish gloss and a circular white patch below the eye, a dark back and a white neck and belly. Adult females have a brown head and a mostly grey body. Their legs and feet are orange-yellow.

The subspecies &quot;B. c. americana&quot; has a longer and thicker bill than the nominate &quot;B. c. clangula&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is the taiga. They are found in the lakes and rivers of boreal forests across Canada and the northern United States, Scotland, Scandinavia, the Baltic States, and northern Russia. They are migratory and most winter in protected coastal waters or open inland waters at more temperate latitudes. Naturally, they nest in cavities in large trees, where they return year after year, though they will readily use nest boxes as well.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
Natural tree cavities chosen for nest sites include those made by broken limbs and those made by large woodpeckers, specifically pileated woodpeckers or black woodpeckers. Average egg size is a breadth of , a length of and a weight of . The incubation period ranges from 28 to 32 days. The female does all the incubating and is abandoned by the male about 1 to 2 weeks into incubation. The young remain in the nest for about 24–36 hours. Brood parasitism is quite common with other common goldeneyes, and occurs less frequently with other duck species. The broods commonly start to mix with other females&#x27; broods as they become more independent or are abandoned by their mothers. Goldeneye young have been known to be competitively killed by other goldeneye mothers, common loons and red-necked grebes. The young are capable of flight at 55–65 days of age.

===Food and feeding===
Common goldeneyes are diving birds that forage under water. Year-round, about 32% of their prey is crustaceans, 28% is aquatic insects and 10% is molluscs. Insects are the predominant prey while nesting and crustaceans are the predominant prey during migration and winter. Locally, fish eggs and aquatic plants can be important foods.

==Predators==
They themselves may fall prey to various hawks, owls and eagles, while females and their broods have been preyed upon by bears (&quot;Ursus&quot; spp.), various weasels (&quot;Mustela&quot; spp.), mink (&quot;Mustela vison&quot;), raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;) and even northern flickers (&quot;Colaptes auratus&quot;) and American red squirrels (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;).

==Conservation==
The common goldeneye is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies. Around 188,300 common goldeneyes were killed annually by duck hunters in North America during the 1970s, representing slightly less than 4% of the total waterfowl killed in Canada during that period, and less than 1% of the total waterfowl killed in the US. Both the breeding and winter habitats of these birds have been degraded by clearance and pollution. However, the common goldeneye in North America is known to derive short-term benefits from lake acidification.

<doc id="263666" wikidata="Q3666778" url="?curid=263666" title="Charmed Life (Billy Idol album)">
<text>Charmed Life is the fourth studio album by English rock singer Billy Idol, released on 30 April 1990 by Chrysalis Records.

The lead single, &quot;Cradle of Love&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack of &quot;The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&quot;. The song was famous for its video, which won the 1990 MTV Video Music Award for &quot;Best video from a film&quot;. The video directed by David Fincher, involved Betsy Lynn George as a teenager who knocks at her neighbour&#x27;s door and asks to play a tape, before stripping to the music. The album&#x27;s second single is a cover version of &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; by The Doors. Its video was also directed by Fincher. The third single off the album was &quot;Prodigal Blues&quot;.

&quot;Charmed Life&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA and Silver by BPI in 1990.

==Background==

Unlike Idol&#x27;s previous three albums, &quot;Charmed Life&quot; did not feature guitarist Steve Stevens, and most of the guitar work was handled by Mark Younger-Smith instead. Idol told &quot;Sounds&quot; in 1990, &quot;Meeting Mark Younger-Smith gave me a lynchpin, someone I could work with by forming a sound and an idea for this album.&quot; Idol finished sessions for the album on 5 February 1990. During the following morning, after picking up the final mixes from Conway Studios, he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident.

&quot;Love Unchained&quot; was inspired by a friend of Idol&#x27;s who died in a motorcycle accident.

<text>Tarkan Tevetoğlu (; born 17 October 1972) is a German-born Turkish singer-songwriter. Since the early 1990s, with his successful albums, he has been a prominent figure of pop music, recognized both in Turkey and worldwide.

Tarkan was born and raised in Alzey, Rhineland-Palatinate, in the-then West Germany. In 1986, he moved to Turkey together with his family. Tarkan, who had been interested in music since his childhood, went to high school at Karamürsel and took music lessons. In the following years, he met the owner of İstanbul Plak, Mehmet Söğütoğlu, and signed a contract to release his albums. 

Tarkan released his first studio album, &quot;Yine Sensiz&quot;, in late 1992, with &quot;Kıl Oldum&quot; being chosen as its lead single. His second one, &quot;Aacayipsin&quot;, was released in 1994, while his third, &quot;Ölürüm Sana&quot;, in 1998: the latter included the song &quot;Şımarık&quot; (&quot;spoilt&quot; in Turkish), that became popular in a number of countries, also for its English version, &quot;Kiss Kiss&quot;. In the same year he signed a new contract with Universal Music Group, and in 1999 his compilation album, &quot;Tarkan&quot;, received platinum and gold certifications in several countries. In 2001, he made music videos for the songs &quot;Kuzu Kuzu&quot;, &quot;Hüp&quot; and &quot;Verme&quot;, from his fourth studio album &quot;Karma&quot;, while two years later, Extended Play &quot;Dudu&quot; performed well on the sales charts. With the release in 2006 of his first English album, &quot;Come Closer&quot;, he became known in Europe: from this Long Play were selected &quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;Start the Fire&quot; as the lead singles. In 2007 was the time of his seventh album, &quot;Metamorfoz&quot;, whose lyrics of the songs included were praised by the Turkish Language Association. In 2010, his eighth studio album, &quot;Adımı Kalbine Yaz&quot;, became the best-selling album of the year in Turkey, and in 2016 was released his ninth album, &quot;Ahde Vefa&quot;, which has a Classical Turkish theme.

Alongside his music career, Tarkan has taken part in numerous social projects and is known as &quot;Megastar&quot; and &quot;Prince of the Bosporus&quot; in the press. One of few European singers who has managed to span chart success without singing in English, he is also noted for his live stage performances. Tarkan&#x27;s effect on Turkey has been compared by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; to that of Elvis Presley in the US around 1957 and Atlantic Records&#x27;s co-founder Ahmet Ertegun described him as one of the best live performers he had ever seen. He has also been listed by Rhapsody as a key artist in the history of European pop music, with his signature song &quot;Şımarık&quot; as a keystone track that moved the genre forward. His albums have sold over 15 million copies. Throughout his career, he has won four Turkey Music Awards, six Golden Butterfly Awards and one World Music Award and has received various nominations.

== Early life ==
Tarkan Tevetoğlu was born on 17 October 1972 in Alzey, then in West Germany, to Neşe and Ali Tevetoğlu. His mother named him after the comic book character Tarkan. The name Tarkan is said to originate from an ancient Turkic king or title, meaning bold and strong. Tarkan&#x27;s interest in music began in childhood. Tarkan and his five siblings moved to Turkey in 1986 with their parents settled in Karamürsel, Kocaeli. After his father&#x27;s death, his mother married an architect, Seyhun Kahraman. Tarkan has three step-siblings named Adnan, Gülay and Nuray, from his mother&#x27;s first marriage, and a brother, Hakan, and a younger sister, Handan, from her marriage to his father.

Tarkan started his high school there and took Turkish Art and Music lessons at the Karamürsel Advanced Music Association. After his family moved to Istanbul, he continued his music studies at the Uskudar Music Society and started performing at various venues. After finishing high school, he made plans to move to Germany for higher education and meanwhile he signed a contract with İstanbul Plak&#x27;s owner Mehmet Söğütoğlu to release his first album.

== Career ==
=== 1992–2000: &quot;Yine Sensiz&quot;, &quot;Aacayipsin&quot; and &quot;Ölürüm Sana&quot; ===
Tarkan&#x27;s first album, &quot;Yine Sensiz&quot;, was released on cassettes by İstanbul Plak on 26 December 1992. He wrote the lyrics for three of the album&#x27;s songs, and composed three other songs himself and chose &quot;Kıl Oldum&quot; to be its lead single. On 18 June 1993, three new versions of the album were released on CD. Alongside &quot;Kıl Oldum&quot;, he made music videos for the songs &quot;Kimdi&quot;, &quot;Gelip de Halimi Gördün mü?&quot;, &quot;Vazgeçemem&quot; and &quot;Çok Ararsın Beni&quot;. The album sold 700,000 copies in total. Wrote one critic: &quot;It happened maybe for the first time in the world of [Turkish] music, that &quot;slang&quot; words were used in songs and the brave young man began to draw attention as much with his songs as with his green eyes.&quot;

In May 1994, his second studio album &quot;Aacayipsin&quot; was released in Turkey; it was subsequently released in Germany and Russia in 1996 and 1998 respectively. Artists Sezen Aksu, Ümit Sayın, Ozan Çolakoğlu and Yıldız Tilbe were among those who were featured on the album. Tarkan wrote the lyrics for four songs, three of which were also composed by him; &quot;Hepsi Senin mi?&quot;, &quot;Unutmamalı&quot;, &quot;Gül Döktüm Yollarına&quot;, &quot;Kış Güneşi&quot;, &quot;Şeytan Azapta&quot;, &quot;Dön Bebeğim&quot; and &quot;Bekle&quot; were the songs that got separate music videos. &quot;Aacayipsin&quot; sold two and a half million copies and earned Tarkan the &quot;Best Male Pop Music Artist&quot; award at the Turkey Music Awards. The song &quot;Hepsi Senin mi?&quot; was also awarded with the &quot;Best Lyrics&quot;, &quot;Best Composition&quot; and &quot;Best Song&quot; awards.

In 1994, he experienced a dip in his celebrity status after he made a gaffe during an interview on a live broadcast marking the anniversary of the private Turkish TV channel ATV. When asked how he was on live television, his response was &quot;Çişim var, ağabey.&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve gotta pee, man.&quot;) He was publicly criticised for the comment and only after performing traditional songs on another TV special did he endear himself again to the nation. In part to remove himself from media scrutiny, Tarkan moved to New York in 1994 to learn English and complete his education at Baruch College. During this period he filmed a video to another song from his second album, &quot;Dön Bebeğim&quot;, in New York. Again Tarkan stripped for this project, but this time he was sharing a bed with a female American model for the slow love song. While in the United States, he met the Turkish founder of Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun. Tarkan has described Ertegun as his mentor in music and business. Ertegun, who died in December 2006, had long been preparing Tarkan for an American career.

In 1997, Tarkan found his own production company Hitt Müzik and in the same year he released his third studio album &quot;Ölürüm Sana&quot;, which sold three and a half million copies. Tarkan himself did the songwriting and composition for many of the songs on this album. &quot;Şımarık&quot;, &quot;İkimizin Yerine&quot;, &quot;Salına Salına Sinsice&quot;, &quot;Ölürüm Sana&quot; and &quot;Kır Zincirlerini&quot; were the songs for which music videos were made. &quot;Şımarık&quot; became a hit in many countries; ranking third in France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland; second in Norway; and first in Belgium; it also ranked 26th on &quot;Billboard&quot; list of Latin Pop Songs. The song was later performed by many other artists. The song &quot;Kır Zincirleri&quot; also made it into Germany, Belgium and France&#x27;s music charts. A copyright dispute erupted between Tarkan and Aksu over the track &quot;Şımarık&quot;, which ultimately blocked the singer&#x27;s chance to release an English-language version of the song. The music was initially credited as composed by Aksu, Tarkan and Çolakoğlu, but Tarkan later admitted in a 2006 interview that this had been done without Aksu&#x27;s consent, and that Aksu was the true copyright owner. This dispute ended their successful musical partnership and friendship.

In 1998, Tarkan signed a contract with Universal Music Group. In the same year, his compilation album &quot;Tarkan&quot; was released in a number of countries including France, Argentina, Russia and the Netherlands, and it also contained his signature songs from his previous albums. &quot;Tarkan&quot; sold one and a half million copies worldwide earning the singer a platinum certification from Mexico, and gold certifications from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Colombia and Luxembourg. In 1999, Tarkan, who already had high sales figures around the world, was honored at the World Music Awards as the Best-Selling Turkish Artist. As the first artist of Turkish origin to sell 500,000 albums in France, in an interview for CNN he said: &quot;It feels wild, you know, because in the beginning I never thought it was going to really happen. It&#x27;s all in Turkish, you know, and nobody understands a word. But I think it&#x27;s a groove. It&#x27;s the kisses that are universal.&quot;

His entry into the European musical consciousness started a Turkish pop boom in Germany and Turkey in the 1990s, with his European successes signalling that the musical borders between Turkey and Europe, more specifically Germany, were dissolving. Because of his success, he became the prime example of a Turkish pop performer with an audience outside Turkey. His erotic persona was enhanced when the artist posed naked and semi-naked for the most popular Turkish magazines of the period.

=== 2001–2006: &quot;Karma&quot;, &quot;Dudu&quot; and &quot;Come Closer&quot; ===

Tarkan released the lead single of his fourth studio album &quot;Kuzu Kuzu&quot; in May 2001, which sold 200,000 copies on cassettes and 500,000 copies in CD format. Three months later, in July 2001 his fourth studio album &quot;Karma&quot; was released. Tarkan wrote and composed six of the songs, and Nazan Öncel, Mete Özgencil and Mazhar Alanson helped in its preparing. The album &quot;Karma&quot; sold one and a half million copies. Although &quot;Karma&quot; was not released worldwide, it was distributed in large shipments to Russia, where he had become the largest-selling non-Russian pop star. A million copies shipped to other areas of Europe, including Denmark. &quot;Hüp&quot; and &quot;Verme&quot;, became the album&#x27;s other songs to get music videos, and the clip for &quot;Hüp&quot; was subject to various negative criticisms. When the video, directed by Ferzan Özpetek, was released, the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council considered banning it from television broadcast, as some viewers complained that the scene in which Tarkan kisses actress Sinemis Candemir was too &quot;explicit&quot; and &quot;pornographic&quot;. The case was reported through Europe by the BBC. At the Golden Butterfly Awards, &quot;Hüp&quot; was awarded with the &quot;Best Video Clip&quot; award; and Tarkan himself received the &quot;Best Male Turkish Pop Music Soloist&quot; award in addition to an honorary award. Tarkan&#x27;s so-called &quot;Karma-era&quot; style projected an image totally different from his earlier persona in respect to both music and looks. His appearance – tight trousers, loose, unbuttoned shirts or tight T-shirts – and his new hairdo set a trend among young Turkish men, who started to copy his looks. According to hairdressers, his &quot;Kuzu Kuzu&quot; hairstyle was the most frequently requested style in the salons of Turkey. During this time he met Michael Lang, co-organiser of the Woodstock Festival, who became his international manager. According to Lang, Tarkan is a great singer and his performance is great.

In 2001 researcher Dr. N Aysun Yüksel published a book titled &quot;Tarkan – Yıldız Olgusu&quot; (&quot;Tarkan – Anatomy of a Star&quot;), which was withdrawn from bookshelves by a court order after Tarkan&#x27;s lawyer Süheyl Atay sued the writer. According to the court&#x27;s decision the book published personal information and copyrighted photos of the artist, and violated his good reputation. In 2002, Tarkan released two new singles &quot;Özgürlük İçimizde&quot; and &quot;Bir Oluruz Yolunda&quot;; modifications in the song &quot;Bir Oluruz Yolunda&quot; were made for the Turkish national football team&#x27;s entry to the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

Tarkan&#x27;s EP album &quot;Dudu&quot; was produced by Ozan Çolakoğlu and released in summer 2003 in Turkey, Ukraine, Russia and Japan. It was the first album of its kind to sell over a million copies in Turkey, while the title track won Tarkan a &quot;Song of the Year Award&quot; in Russia. Although musically a continuation from &quot;Karma&quot;, in terms of image &quot;Dudu&quot; presented different visuals from the 2001–2003 period. Sexuality became secondary in terms of fashion and concerts were toned down to become intimate affairs. The new image portrayed a more laid back Tarkan sporting shorter hair and wearing less glamorous designs. It was a declaration that glitz and sex were no longer a necessary tool to sell his works. Indicating his desire to show different sides of his personality, he said of his new look: &quot;It&#x27;s not important how sexy I look or whether I dance sexy&quot;. &quot;Dudu&quot;, &quot;Sorma Kalbim&quot;, &quot;Gülümse Kaderine&quot; and &quot;Uzun İnce Bir Yoldayım&quot;, were the song from the EP that were made into music videos. The album sold one million copies. In 2004, Tarkan was chosen as the &quot;Best Male Pop Music Artist&quot; at the Turkey Music Awards.

In 2005, Tarkan released the single &quot;Ayrılık Zor&quot; followed by &quot;Bounce&quot; in 2006, which was sold in Europe as well. In April 2006, after a long period of preparations, he released his English studio album &quot;Come Closer&quot; on 7 April. It included 15 songs in total. The plans for &quot;Come Closer&quot; had begun in 1995, when media mogul Ahmet Ertegun encouraged Tarkan to break into the international market. The album, ranked 18th on Germany&#x27;s music charts, 43rd on Switzerland&#x27;s charts, 50th on Austria&#x27;s charts; and sold 110,000 copies in Turkey. A Turkish music pirate, well before the official release, leaked four stolen demo recordings from the debut English album onto the internet. Thousands of copies were downloaded illegally before the album&#x27;s official release. The leaked songs garnered considerable airplay in dance clubs in Turkey before Tarkan&#x27;s management took legal action against DJ&#x27;s playing them.

=== 2007–2015: &quot;Metamorfoz&quot; and &quot;Adımı Kalbine Yaz&quot; ===
On 23 December 2007, Tarkan&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Metamorfoz&quot; was released. Tarkan wrote all of the songs of this album, and composed seven of them. For the Turkish idioms and proverbs widely used in the lyrics, he was praised by the Turkish Language Association, showing in the association&#x27;s view a good example to Turkish youth in preserving the culture of the Turkish language. The critical response to &quot;Metamorfoz&quot; was lukewarm. Most music critics found the album musically lacking in comparison with Tarkan&#x27;s earlier albums. Ecevit Kılıç, columnist for &quot;Sabah&quot; newspaper, hailed Tarkan on his return and called him the &quot;Orhan Pamuk of music&quot;, saying that Tarkan, just like Nobel award recipient Pamuk, always does everything his own way, despite all the attacks he has received from the press. The album sold 200,000 copies and the songs &quot;Vay Anam Vay&quot;, &quot;Pare Pare&quot;, &quot;Arada Bir&quot; and &quot;Dilli Düdük&quot; were made into music videos. Tarkan received gold and diamond certifications from MÜ-YAP in 2008 and 2009 respectively. In 2008, the remixed versions of the songs from &quot;Metamorfoz&quot; were released in two CDs under the title &quot;Metamorfoz Remixes&quot;. Dutch DJ Tiësto served as the remix album&#x27;s producer. In the same year, the singer released the song &quot;Uyan&quot;, which he prepared to support Doğa Derneği (Nature Society).

In July 2010, Tarkan&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Adımı Kalbine Yaz&quot; was released and sold 355,000 copies. The song &quot;Sevdanın Son Vuruşu&quot;, which was released before the album, won the &quot;Best Song&quot;, &quot;Best Composition&quot;, and &quot;Best Lyrics&quot; award at the Turkey Music Awards; the album itself was chosen as the Best Album. The songs &quot;Öp&quot;, &quot;Acımayacak&quot;, &quot;Kayıp&quot; and &quot;Adımı Kalbine Yaz&quot; were turned into music videos, and &quot;Öp&quot; won the &quot;Best Video Clip&quot; award at the Turkey Music Awards. According to a survey conducted in 2011, Tarkan was the most searched artist on Google in Turkey.

In 2012, Tarkan recorded the song &quot;Aşk Gitti Bizden&quot; for Ozan Çolakoğlu&#x27;s debut album &quot;01&quot;. In the early months of 2013, he started working on his new album. In June 2013, he was featured on the album &quot;Aysel&#x27;in&quot;, in tribute to Aysel Gürel, and performed the song &quot;Firuze&quot;. In August 2014, he recorded and performed the song &quot;Hop De&quot; for İskender Paydaş&#x27;s album &quot;Zamansız Şarkılar 2&quot;. On 22 August 2014, he became the first Turkish singer to perform at the closing concert of Monte Carlo Sporting Summer Festival on its fortieth anniversary.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Ahde Vefa&quot; and &quot;10&quot; ===
On 11 March 2016, Tarkan&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Ahde Vefa&quot; was released. It was produced by Hitt Müzik and distributed by DMC.&quot;Ahde Vefa&quot; is Tarkan&#x27;s first Classical Turkish album. Within one week of its release, it sold 170,000 copies.

On 14 July 2016, his single &quot;Cuppa&quot; was released. At the 43rd Golden Butterfly Awards, &quot;Ahde Vefâ&quot; was chosen as the &quot;Best Project&quot; in the Turkish Classical Music category. Tarkan released his new album &quot;10&quot; under the label DMC on 15 June 2017. Out of the 14 songs in the album, &quot;Yolla&quot; was released as the lead single and made into music video. The songs &quot;Beni Çok Sev&quot;, &quot;Çok Ağladım&quot;, &quot;Kedi Gibi&quot;, and &quot;O Sevişmeler&quot; were also released with separate music videos. Out of these songs, &quot;Yolla&quot; and &quot;Beni Çok Sev&quot; both topped the official music chart in Turkey.

According to Telifmetre, Tarkan was the male artist with the most streams in Turkey in the first six months of 2019.

On 17 February 2022, Tarkan released a new song, titled &quot;Geççek&quot;. The song was widely shared by politicians of oppositional parties in Turkey, causing a political controversy.

== Popularity ==
According to Ahmet Ertegun: &quot;He&#x27;s a great dancer, he moves beautifully, and he has the magic that all big hit artists share, which is the ability to get an emotion across through a recording.&quot;

His song &quot;Şımarık&quot; has been sampled by various artists in these countries, and the film industry in India has also used several Tarkan hits, including &quot;Şıkıdım&quot;, &quot;Kuzu Kuzu&quot; and &quot;Dudu&quot;, for various Bollywood films. His &quot;Kış Güneşi&quot; song has been chosen as one of &quot;The Unforgettable Hits of Turkish Music&quot; by &quot;Hürriyet&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Military service===
At the height of his fame in 1999, Tarkan was called up for military service, which had been legally deferred since 1995. The deadline for beginning his service had passed in 1998, but due to contractual obligations abroad after the success of his compilation album he did not return to Turkey to do his military service. The media discussed whether Tarkan should be viewed as a deserter and stripped of his citizenship. Even the Turkish parliament discussed the issue. After the August 1999 earthquake shook Turkey, legislation was enacted that allowed those covered by the law to pay $16,000 for the benefit of the earthquake victims in return for shortening their military service obligation to 28 days. Tarkan returned to Turkey in 2000, took advantage of this law, and completed his service. Of his shortened time in military training, he said: &quot;It was January and snowing like crazy. It was tough; the food was terrible. Eighteen months of my life for nothing? I thought my own dreams were more important.&quot;

===Relationships and rumours===
Tarkan was in a relationship with a French model in the early 1990s, and with a Turkish journalist between 1994 and 1996. Because Tarkan prefers to keep information about his personal life private, there has been speculation about his sexual orientation in the popular press. Photos stolen from his house in New York in 2001 were portrayed as compromising; they were photos with other men in swimwear at a public nude beach. In one of the pictures, he appears to be kissing a man. In an interview with &quot;Hürriyet&quot;, Tarkan contested the widespread assumption that he was gay. He claimed that other men had spread these rumours about him because he didn&#x27;t conform to their image of being a man. One of his ex-girlfriends also denied he was gay. Tarkan later gave fewer and fewer interviews and television appearances, limiting himself to a small number of trusted journalists. In 2006, he said that his relationship with the media had gone wrong.

He was in a relationship with a lawyer, Bilge Öztürk, for seven years until they amicably parted in 2008. He has told the media that he regards the institution of marriage as outdated, stating he would only get married for the benefit of any children he might have. Tarkan owns a ranch-like property in Polonezköy, Istanbul, where he cultivates fruit trees and keeps animals, and owned a flat in Murray Hill, New York City.

===Marriage===
On 29 April 2016, Tarkan married his long-time girlfriend, Pınar Dilek. The couple met in 2011 after a concert in Germany. Dilek had been a fan of Tarkan long before they got acquainted. On 12 July 2018, the couple had their first child, a daughter named Liya.

===Health===
Tarkan, who had been suffering from sleeping issues and voice disorders due to thyroid nodules, underwent a successful surgery at Maslak Acıbadem Hospital in June 2019.

<text>Bartholomew Augustine Santamaria (14 August 1915 – 25 February 1998), usually known as B. A. Santamaria or Bob Santamaria and sometimes writing under the pseudonym John Williams, was an Australian Roman Catholic anti-communist political activist and journalist. He was a guiding influence in the founding of the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), the party that split from the Labor Party (ALP) in the 1950s.

==Early and family life==
Santamaria was born in Melbourne. The son of a greengrocer who was an immigrant from the Aeolian Islands in Italy, Santamaria was educated at St Ambrose&#x27;s Catholic Primary School in Brunswick, behind his father&#x27;s shop, and later at St Joseph&#x27;s College in North Melbourne by the Christian Brothers. He finished his secondary education at St Kevin&#x27;s College as dux of the school. One of his teachers, Francis Maher, belonged to a newly founded Roman Catholic association, the Campion Society. Santamaria attended the University of Melbourne, where he graduated in arts and law. He completed his Master of Arts degree with a thesis entitled &quot;Italy Changes Shirts: The Origins of Italian Fascism&quot;. Santamaria was a political activist from an early age who earned recognition as a leading Catholic student activist. During the Spanish Civil War, he was a strident supporter of the Nationalist side.

Santamaria was married in 1939 and had eight children. In 1980 his wife, Helen, died. He later married Dorothy Jensen, his long-time secretary. His younger brother, Joseph (Joseph Natalino Santamaria; also known as Joe), was a Melbourne surgeon and prominent in the Roman Catholic bioethics movement. His daughter Bernadette Tobin, is a leading Catholic bioethicist, and his son Joseph Santamaria is an Australian jurist and a former judge of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Victoria.

==Catholic Worker movements==
In 1936 he co-founded &quot;The Catholic Worker&quot;, a newspaper influenced by the social teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; of Pope Leo XIII. He was the first editor of the paper which declared itself opposed to both communism and capitalism. Although the group campaigned for the rights of workers and against what it saw as the excesses of capitalism, Santamaria came to see the Communist Party of Australia, which in the 1940s made great advances in the Australian trade union movement, as the main enemy. In 1937 he was persuaded by Archbishop Daniel Mannix to join the National Secretariat of Catholic Action, a lay activist organisation. 

During World War II, Santamaria gained an exemption from military service. In 1972 Arthur Calwell, a leading Catholic Labor politician, confirmed that Santamaria had &quot;dodged&quot; war service after Mannix had approached him to gain the exemption. When asked, Calwell stated &quot;I want to put the record straight because apparently the Department of Defence cannot find any of the records, nor can the Department of Labour and National Service.&quot; Santamaria and two other men (Maher and K. W. Mitchell) were, argued Mannix, &quot;members of the Secretariat of Catholic Action and that their work was equivalent to that of a minister of religion.&quot; Calwell said &#x27;I regret my part in it... I want the country to know that these three men who have been pestering and opposing and demonstrating against the Australian Labor Party for the last 30 years were people who dodged military service&#x27;. He reflected on the Vietnam War and noted that all three supported it and &quot;conscription of men for military service&quot;, adding &quot;I regret that these people who benefited from our generosity did not beget any children who went out to fight in the war in Vietnam. Their sons were exempted, all of them, because they were employed in reserve institutions as were their fathers.&quot; Santamaria denied the allegation that he had ever sought an exemption. and stated that &#x27;if Mr Calwell repeated his statement outside of parliament he would take appropriate action&#x27;. Calwell moderated his statements regarding Maher, but not on Mitchell or Santamaria. In May 1972, previously missing records were found confirming Calwell&#x27;s version.

In 1941, Santamaria founded the Catholic Social Studies Movement, generally known simply as &quot;the Movement&quot; or Groupers, which recruited Catholic activists to oppose the spread of communism, particularly in the trade unions. The movement gained control of the Industrial Groups in the unions, fighting the communists and gaining control of many unions. This activity brought him into conflict not only with the Communist Party but with many left-wing Labor Party members, who favoured a united front with the communists during the war. During the 1930s and 1940s Santamaria generally supported the conservative Catholic wing of the Labor Party, but as the Cold War developed after 1945 his anti-communism drove him further away from Labor, particularly when H.V. Evatt became Leader of the Labor Party in 1951.

==Labor split and the National Civic Council==

Events leading to &quot;The Split&quot; included a well publicised incident in the Parliament of Victoria. In October 1954, the &quot;Sydney Sun-Herald&quot; reported on a letter sent by the Victorian Minister for Lands, Robert W. Holt, to the federal secretary of the Australian Labor Party, a Mr J. Schmella, which the paper described as &quot;probably as explosive, politically, as any document in Australia&quot;. Holt stated &quot;My charge is that the Victorian branch is controlled and directed in the main by one group or section through Mr. B. Santamaria ... My criticism is not personal. It is leveled against those ideas which are contrary to what I believe Labor policy to be. Moreover, I have been requested by my numerous and trusted friends, who happen to be Catholic, to fight against the influence of Mr. Santamaria and those he represents, when he seeks to implement his ideas through an abuse of a political movement, designed to serve a truly political purpose.&quot;

Holt spoke of events the previous year and described attending a meeting of Santamaria&#x27;s National Catholic Rural Movement Convention, following which he was, as Minister of Lands, approached by Santamaria and Frank Scully, where he was asked to use his position to make Crown land available to &quot;Italians with foreign capital&quot;. When he refused, &quot;Santamaria stated that I might not be in the next parliament&quot;, and Scully agreed. Holt considered this &quot;a direct threat&quot; which was confirmed when another M.L.A. confided that there was &#x27;pressure&#x27; to oppose him for party selection for his seat. He added that &quot;subsequent events which happened during the selection ballot&#x27; had convinced him that the ALP&#x27;s &quot;Victorian branch is not free to implement Labor policy and connives with this method&quot;. He concluded by stating his belief in:a party machine which permits the true expression of opinion of its members, regardless of who or what they may be. The only requirement is loyalty to Labor ideals and principles. This is not possible in the present circumstances...

Holt introduced the Land Bill without Santamaria&#x27;s desired advantage and it was at first amended by another ALP member, then defeated, amended again and passed – with what Santamaria wanted – after two Liberal party members &quot;switched sides&quot;. In December 1954, Santamaria launched a suit against Holt for libel, citing the letter published in-full by the &quot;Sun-Herald&quot;. The libel action was withdrawn, without explanation, in April 1955.

In 1954 Evatt publicly blamed &quot;the Groupers&quot; for Labor&#x27;s defeat in that year&#x27;s federal election, and after a tumultuous National Conference in Hobart in 1955, Santamaria&#x27;s parliamentary followers were expelled from the Labor Party. The resulting split (now usually called &quot;The Split&quot;, although there have been several other &quot;splits&quot; in Labor history) brought down the Labor government of John Cain senior in Victoria. In Victoria, Dr Mannix strongly supported Santamaria, but in New South Wales, Norman Cardinal Gilroy, the first Australian-born Roman Catholic prelate, opposed him, favouring the traditional alliance between the Church and Labor. Gilroy&#x27;s influence in Rome helped to end official Church support for the Groupers. In January 1955, Santamaria used Dr Mannix as his witness to the statement, &quot;There is no Catholic organisation seeking to dominate the Labor Party or any other political party ... So that there will be no equivocation, Catholics are not associated with any other secular body seeking to dominate the Labor Party or any other political party.&quot;

Santamaria made this statement when he denied charges from the general secretary of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union (Mr T Dougherty) that the &quot;No. 2-man in the Victorian ALP&quot; (Frank McManus), the &quot;No. 2-man in the NSW Labor Party&quot; (J. Kane) and the &quot;secretary of the Australian Rules Football Association of Queensland&quot; (Mr Polgrain) were Santamaria&#x27;s &quot;top lieutenants in &quot;The Movement&quot;&quot;. For his part, McManus suggested that Dougherty &quot;appeared to have contracted an ailment from one of his political colleagues ... the chief symptom of this ailment was that the sufferer believed he was always detecting conspiracy theories&quot;.

Santamaria founded a new organisation no longer an organ of Catholic Action, the National Civic Council (NCC), and edited its newspaper, &quot;News Weekly&quot;, for many years. His followers, known as Groupers, continued to control a number of important unions. Those expelled from the Labor Party formed a new party, the Democratic Labor Party (DLP), dedicated to opposing both Communism and the Labor Party, which they said was controlled by Communist sympathisers. Santamaria never joined the DLP but was one of its guiding influences.

==Anti-communist and social conservative==
During the 1960s and 1970s, Santamaria regularly warned of the dangers of communism in Southeast Asia, and supported South Vietnam and the United States in the Vietnam War. He founded the Australian Family Association and the Thomas More Centre (for Traditional Catholicism) to extend the work of the NCC. However, his political role gradually declined. The death of the 99-year-old Archbishop Mannix (in 1963) ended the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s support for the NCC, even in Victoria. In 1974 the DLP lost all its seats in the Senate, and was wound up a few years later. Santamaria ran the NCC in a highly personal and (according to his critics) autocratic way, and in 1982 there was a serious split in the organisation, with most of the trade unionists leaving it.

The first of four unions disaffiliated after the split of 1955, attempted to return at the ALP Victorian State Conference in 1983. The Federated Clerks&#x27; Union and three others similarly aligned &#x27;right-wing&#x27; unions – the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the Federated Ironworkers&#x27; Association of Australia and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners – had their re-affiliation cases considered by a special Victorian ALP committee of ten which split on the decision 5 against 5 and had submitted separate reports to the State Conference. The Federated Clerks&#x27; case, &#x27;after a bitter and at times acrimonious 3 and a 1/2-hour debate&#x27;, which was &#x27;centred on alleged links&#x27; with Santamaria, the National Civic Council, and the Industrial Action Fund, was defeated at the State Conference by 289 votes to 189. It was noted in a news report of the time that all four were likely to appeal to the federal ALP executive and that they had the support of then Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The ALP federal executive supported the re-affiliation before the 1985 Victorian State Conference while two of the unions were refused re-affiliation in the Northern Territory later that year. Ultimately, all four returned as ALP affiliated unions in some form; the Federated Clerks&#x27; Union amalgamated into the affiliated Australian Services Union in 1993, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association is a current ALP affiliated union, while the Federated Ironworkers&#x27; Association of Australia and the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners amalgamated with the affiliated Australian Workers&#x27; Union.

But Santamaria&#x27;s personal stature continued to grow, through his regular column in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper and his regular television spot, &quot;Point of View&quot; (he was given free air time by Frank Packer, owner of the Nine Network). He was one of the most articulate voices of Australian conservatism for more than 20 years.

According to historians David McKnight and C. J. Coventry, Santamaria worked for the United States of America as an informer in the 1960s and 1970s discreetly providing information about Australia to diplomatic officials.

He was offered a knighthood by Malcolm Fraser but declined it.

==Traditionalism in the Catholic Church==
Santamaria also opposed what he saw as liberal and non-traditional trends in the Catholic Church following the Second Vatican Council (which he had sought to attend as an independent observer), and founded a magazine through his Thomas More Centre, called AD 2000, to argue for traditionalist views. He welcomed Pope John Paul II&#x27;s return to conservatism in many areas.

The conservative Archbishop of Melbourne, George Pell, a staunch supporter of Santamaria, delivered the panegyric at his funeral, which was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne. Santamaria had died from an inoperable brain tumour at age 82 at Caritas Christi Hospice, Kew, Victoria. On his death Santamaria was praised by conservatives for his opposition to communism, but also by some on the left (such as veteran left-wing Labor ex-Cabinet Minister Clyde Cameron) and by social democrats (such as former Governor-General Bill Hayden) for his consistent critique of unrestricted capitalism.

<text>James Melvin Lunceford (June 6, 1902 – July 12, 1947) was an American jazz alto saxophonist and bandleader in the swing era.

==Early life==
Lunceford was born on a farm in the Evergreen community, west of the Tombigbee River, near Fulton, Mississippi, United States. The farm was owned by his father, James. His mother was Idella (&quot;Ida&quot;) Shumpert of Oklahoma City, an organist of &quot;more than average ability&quot;. Seven months after James Melvin was born, the family moved to Oklahoma City.

The family next moved to Denver where Lunceford attended high school and studied music under Wilberforce J. Whiteman, father of Paul Whiteman, whose band was soon to acquire a national reputation. As a child in Denver, he learned several instruments. After high school, Lunceford continued his studies at Fisk University. In 1922, he played alto saxophone in a local band led by the violinist George Morrison which included Andy Kirk, another musician destined for fame as a bandleader.

==Career==

In 1927, while an athletic instructor at Manassas High School in Memphis, Tennessee, Lunceford organized a student band, the Chickasaw Syncopators, whose name was changed to the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra. Under the new name, the band started its professional career in 1929, and made its first recordings in 1930. Lunceford was the first public high school band director in Memphis.

After a period of touring, in 1934 the band accepted a booking at the Harlem nightclub The Cotton Club for their revue &quot;Cotton Club Parade&quot; starring Adelaide Hall. The Cotton Club had already featured Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, who won their first widespread fame from their inventive shows for the Cotton Club&#x27;s all-white patrons. With their tight musicianship and the often outrageous humor in their music and lyrics, Lunceford&#x27;s orchestra made an ideal band for the club, and Lunceford&#x27;s reputation began to steadily grow.

Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s band differed from other great bands of the time because it was better known for its ensemble than for its solo work. Additionally, he was known for using a two-beat rhythm, called the Lunceford two-beat, as opposed to the standard four-beat rhythm. This distinctive &quot;Lunceford style&quot; was largely the result of the imaginative arrangements by trumpeter Sy Oliver, which set high standards for dance-band arrangers of the time. Though not well known as a musician, Lunceford knew how to play several instruments and was even featured on flute in &quot;Liza&quot;.

Comedy and vaudeville played a distinct part in Lunceford&#x27;s presentation. Songs such as &quot;Rhythm Is Our Business&quot; (featured in a 1937 musical short with Myra Johnson (Taylor) on vocals), &quot;I&#x27;m Nuts about Screwy Music&quot;, &quot;I Want the Waiter (With the Water)&quot;, and &quot;Four or Five Times&quot; displayed a playful sense of swing, often through clever arrangements by trumpeter Sy Oliver and bizarre lyrics. Lunceford&#x27;s stage shows often included costumes, skits, and obvious jabs at mainstream white bands, such as Paul Whiteman&#x27;s and Guy Lombardo&#x27;s.

Despite the band&#x27;s comic veneer, Lunceford always maintained professionalism in the music befitting a former teacher; this professionalism paid off and during the apex of swing in the 1930s, the Orchestra was considered the equal of Duke Ellington&#x27;s, Earl Hines&#x27; or Count Basie&#x27;s. This precision can be heard in such pieces as &quot;Wham (Re-Bop-Boom-Bam)&quot;, &quot;Lunceford Special&quot;, &quot;For Dancers Only&quot;, &quot;Uptown Blues&quot;, and &quot;Stratosphere&quot;. The band&#x27;s noted saxophone section was led by alto sax player Willie Smith. Lunceford often used a conducting baton to lead his band.

The orchestra began recording for the Decca label and later signed with the Columbia subsidiary Vocalion in 1938. They toured Europe extensively in 1937, but had to cancel a second tour in 1939 because of the outbreak of World War II. Columbia dropped Lunceford in 1940 because of flagging sales. (Oliver departed the group before the scheduled European tour to take a position as an arranger for Tommy Dorsey). Lunceford returned to the Decca label. The orchestra appeared in the 1941 movie &quot;Blues in the Night&quot;.

Lunceford&#x27;s band was hired to play at the Elks Ballroom in Los Angeles on September 26, 1940 and again on June 26, 1947, by Leon Hefflin Sr. Most of Lunceford&#x27;s sidemen were underpaid and left for better paying bands, leading to the band&#x27;s decline.

==Death==
After playing McElroy&#x27;s Ballroom in Portland, Lunceford and his orchestra were in Seaside, Oregon, to play at The Bungalow dance hall on July 12, 1947. Before the performance Lunceford collapsed during an autograph session at a local record store. He died while being taken by ambulance to the Seaside hospital. Lunceford was 45. Dr. Alton Alderman performed an autopsy in nearby Astoria, Oregon, and concluded that Lunceford died of coronary occlusion.

Lunceford had complained about an aching leg as they arrived in Seaside, and had been suffering with high blood pressure for a while, and had recently complained about not feeling well. Allegations and rumors circulated that he had been poisoned by a restaurant owner, who was unhappy at having to serve a &quot;Negro&quot; in his establishment. He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.

==Legacy==

Band members, such as Eddie Wilcox and Joe Thomas, kept the band going for a time but finally had to break up the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra in 1949.

In 1999, band-leader Robert Veen and a team of musicians set out to acquire permission to use the original band charts and arrangements of the Jimmie Lunceford canon. &quot;The Jimmie Lunceford Legacy Orchestra&quot; officially debuted in July 2005 at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands.

The Jimmie Lunceford Jamboree Festival was founded by Bro. Ronald Cortez Herd II (aka &#x27;R2C2H2 Tha Artivist&#x27;) in 2007 with the aim of increasing recognition of Lunceford&#x27;s contribution to jazz, particularly in Memphis, Tennessee. The Jimmie Lunceford Legacy Awards were created by the festival to honor exceptional musicians with Memphis ties as well as those who have dedicated their careers to excellence in music and music education.

Lunceford&#x27;s music continues to have an impact. Most recently the tune &quot;Rhythm Is Our Business&quot; was included as a track on the compilation set &quot;Memphis Jazz Box&quot; in 2004 in honor of Lunceford&#x27;s close ties to Memphis.

On July 19, 2009, a brass note was dedicated to Lunceford on the Beale Street Walk of Fame in Memphis.

<text>Café society was the description of the &quot;Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;Bright Young Things&quot; who gathered in fashionable cafés and restaurants in New York, Paris and London beginning in the late 19th century. Maury Henry Biddle Paul is credited with coining the phrase &quot;café society&quot; in 1915.

Members attended each other&#x27;s private dinners and balls, and took holidays in exotic locations or at elegant resorts. In the United States, café society came to the fore with the end of Prohibition in December 1933, and the rise of photojournalism to describe the set of people who tended to do their entertaining semi-publicly—in restaurants and nightclubs—and who would include among them movie stars and sports celebrities. Some of the American nightclubs and New York City restaurants frequented by the denizens of café society included the 21 Club, El Morocco, Restaurant Larue, and the Stork Club.

<doc id="263678" wikidata="Q1711695" url="?curid=263678" title="Member of the Scottish Parliament">
<text>Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP; ; ) is the title given to any one of the 129 individuals elected to serve in the Scottish Parliament.

==Electoral system==
The additional member system produces a form of proportional representation, where each constituency has its own representative, and each region has seats given to political parties to reflect as closely as possible its level of support among voters. Each registered voter is asked to cast 2 votes, resulting in MSPs being elected in one of two ways:
* 73 are elected as First past the post constituency MSPs and;
* 56 are elected as Regional additional member MSPs. Seven are elected from each of eight regional groups of constituencies.

==Types of candidates==
With the additional members system, there are 3 ways in which a person can stand to be a MSP:
* a constituency candidate
* a candidate named on a party list at the regional election
* an individual candidate at the regional election

A candidate may stand both in a constituency and on a regional list. Constituency seats are decided first. Candidates who succeed in being elected to a constituency seat will then have their name removed from the regional list process.

==Elections==
All MSP positions become simultaneously vacant for elections held on a five-year cycle. The Scotland Act 1998 as amended by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 sets out that ordinary general elections for the Scottish Parliament are held on the first Thursday in May, every five years.

If a vacancy arises at another time, due to death or resignation, then it may be filled in one of two ways, depending on whether the vacancy is for a first-past-the-post constituency MSP or for an additional-member MSP.

A constituency vacancy may be filled by a by-election. An additional-member vacancy may be filled by the next available candidate on the relevant party list. In case there is no next available person, then the vacancy will remain. This situation occurred in April 2014 following the death of Margo MacDonald, independent MSP for the Lothian region.

==Title==
An MSP is known as &quot;Name&quot; MSP (&quot;Name&quot; BPA in Gaelic). For instance, Mike Russell can be entitled either Mike Russell, MSP, or Mìcheal Ruiseal, BPA.

<doc id="263703" wikidata="Q1347442" url="?curid=263703" title="Moda Center">
<text>Moda Center, formerly known as the Rose Garden, is the primary indoor sports arena in Portland, Oregon, United States. It is used for basketball, rodeos, circuses, conventions, ice shows, concerts, and dramatic productions. The arena has a capacity of 20,500 spectators when configured for basketball. It is equipped with state-of-the-art acoustics and other amenities.

The arena is owned by the City of Portland. The primary tenant is the Portland Trail Blazers NBA franchise, owned by Paul Allen&#x27;s estate. In addition, the Portland WNBA team will make its debut in the arena in 2026.

The other major tenant of the building was the major junior hockey franchise Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, which used to split its schedule with the Memorial Coliseum next door. In addition to the Blazers and Winterhawks, several other professional sports franchises, and the Portland State University men&#x27;s basketball team, either currently play home games in Moda Center, or have done so in the past. In addition, Moda Center is a popular venue for concerts and other artistic productions.

Construction began in 1993, and the arena opened on October 12, 1995. The arena cost US$262 million to build; construction was financed with funds obtained by a variety of sources, including the City of Portland, Allen&#x27;s personal fortune, and $155 million in bonds issued by a consortium of mutual funds and insurance companies. These bonds would become the subject of an acrimonious 2004 bankruptcy in which the Oregon Arena Corporation, the holding company which owned the arena at the time, would forfeit title to the arena in lieu of repaying the bonds per the payment terms. Allen would later repurchase the arena from the creditors in 2007.

==Description==

Moda Center is a multipurpose arena which is suitable for numerous indoor sports, including basketball, ice hockey, arena football, and lacrosse, as well as for hosting other events such as concerts, conventions, and circuses. The arena is located in a sports and entertainment district known as the Rose Quarter, a parcel of land in inner northeast Portland which also includes the Memorial Coliseum arena, as well as several parking structures, restaurants, and other amenities.

===Name===
The original name of the facility was &quot;Rose Garden&quot;; however, the arena was also commonly known as the &quot;Rose Garden Arena&quot; to disambiguate it from the International Rose Test Garden, also located in Portland. The name was chosen both to reflect Portland&#x27;s reputation as the Rose City, and to reflect the importance to basketball heritage of Boston Garden and Madison Square Garden arenas in Boston and New York City, respectively. When the name was selected, the remainder of the former coliseum grounds were given the name &quot;Rose Quarter&quot;.

In 2007, the Trail Blazers and Vulcan announced that they were seeking a corporate partner to grant naming rights for the facility, with the goal of a new name being available for the Blazers&#x27; 2008–09 season. In August 2013, the Trail Blazers announced a 10-year deal with Moda Health, an Oregon-based health insurance provider, to rename the arena Moda Center.

The renaming spurred a public outcry and petition by fans and Portlanders who preferred the old name. Portland mayor Charlie Hales initially expressed concern about the name, calling it a &quot;head scratcher&quot;.

===Structure and architecture===
Moda Center is a precast concrete-framed structure with a roof made up of skeletal steel. The arena structure encloses a total of over , on eight levels, five of which are open to the public. The building height is , from the event floor to the pinnacle of the saddle-shaped roof. The arena includes a permanent stage, and a ice rink.

The building is composed of over of concrete, and over of steel. The exterior is composed of over of glass, of plaster, of architectural precast, of insulation, and of steel louvers.

The building, designed by architecture firm Ellerbe Becket, has been criticized by some in Portland&#x27;s architectural community. A survey of local architects and planners was conducted by the &quot;Portland Tribune&quot;, and subsequently Moda Center was listed among the five ugliest buildings in the city.

===Seating===

The arena has a total of over 14,000 permanent seats arranged in two bowls. An additional 1540 permanent seats are found in the arena&#x27;s 70 skyboxes. Over 4,200 portable seats may or may not be installed, depending on the arena&#x27;s configuration. When configured for basketball, the arena has a capacity of 19,393, and can accommodate a total of up to 20,796 patrons with standing room. Prior to the 1998 NBA season the capacity was reduced to 19,980 from the original 21,485 spectators. When configured for hockey or lacrosse, capacity decreases to 17,544. The arena supports numerous other configurations for events such as concerts, monster trucks, and circuses. The seating below the suites, known as the lower bowl, is further divided into the 100 and 200 levels. The upper bowl seats, above the suites, are the 300 level.

====Skyboxes and suites====
The arena features 70 Suites and 8 Skyboxes each with a seating capacity of 22 guests. Suites include amenities such as a wet bar, catering, a private restroom, multiple television monitors, and a sound system. Suites may be rented on a yearly or single-event basis; yearly renters of suites are given access to all Moda Center events. The arena also features modular party suites, which can be configured either as a pair of 44-person Super Suites, or as one 88-person mega suite.

====Theater of the Clouds====
For smaller, more intimate events, Moda Center can be placed into a configuration known as the &quot;Theater of the Clouds&quot;. This configuration, part of a trend of large arenas having smaller theater configurations, places the stage at center court, and utilizes the western side of the arena. Custom floor-to-ceiling theater curtains are draped at the edges of the seating area, creating a more intimate setting. As of 2004, on average 10 events per year have been held in the Theater of the Clouds configuration.
The Theater of the Clouds configuration seats 6,500, with 16 of the 70 luxury boxes being usable.

===Amenities===
Two concourses, the 100 level and the 300 level, are open to the ticket-buying public during events; the 100 level concourse provides access to the lower bowl (including the 200-level seats); the 300-level concourse provides access to the upper bowl. A third concourse, the 200 level, provides access to guest services such as a sports bar, a barbecue grill, an executive banquet facility, and several outdoor terraces. A fourth concourse, known as Suite Level, provides access to the skyboxes and is restricted to patrons who have skybox admission. All concourses provide a variety of concession stands. The arena also features 32 public restrooms; women&#x27;s toilets outnumber men&#x27;s toilets 3 to 1. There are Wi-Fi hotspots throughout the arena. The concourses are decorated with historical memorabilia.

The primary scoreboard is a Mitsubishi-manufactured HD video scoreboard. This scoreboard, which hangs from the ceiling over center court, features four 15 feet by 22.5 feet (4.5 m by 6.75 m) video screens, among the biggest in the NBA. The arena also features over 650 television monitors placed throughout, showing the action on court. Auxiliary scoreboards located both in the arena itself and the concourses provide statistical information, including &quot;hustle&quot; statistics for basketball (rebounds, blocked shots, and steals). Three media towers, one at each main entrance, provide video of other games in the NBA.

===Acoustics===
A unique feature found in no other multi-purpose arena is known as the &quot;acoustical cloud&quot;. The acoustical cloud is a set of 160 rotating acoustic panels suspended from the Moda Center ceiling, intended to recreate the roar of noise that made the old Memorial Coliseum one of the loudest buildings in the NBA. One side of each 10 feet by 10 feet (3 m by 3 m) panel reflects sound, while the other side absorbs sound. Each panel is shaped like an airplane wing, and is 8 inches (20 cm) thick at the center and 4 inches (10 cm) thick at the edges. The effect during Blazers games is to absorb the noise from the upper levels and reflect it back down to the court.

The panels permit the acoustics of the arena to be adjusted according to the requirements of the event. For smaller events in which only the lower bowl of the arena is used, the panels can be lowered to further improve the sound and increase the intimacy of the arena. The acoustical cloud cost US$2 million to design and install. The arena is also equipped with a JBL sound system.
The acoustics of Moda Center have been widely praised compared to similar venues.

==Ownership and management==
Moda Center is owned by the City of Portland, which acquired the arena from the Estate of Paul Allen in 2024. Management and operation of Moda Center, along with other Rose Quarter facilities, is performed by Rip City Management, a sister company of the Portland Trail Blazers, also wholly owned by the estate of Paul Allen.

==Tenants==

The arena&#x27;s current primary tenant is the Portland Trail Blazers of the NBA. Both the Trail Blazers and Moda Center are ultimately owned by the estate of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which also owns the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League. The head of the estate is his sister Jody Allen. The Trail Blazers have a lease agreement with Moda Health which runs through 2025, and an exclusive site agreement with the City of Portland requires the team to remain in Portland through October 2030.

It was home to the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, a Canadian-based junior hockey league. Both the Trail Blazers and Winterhawks previously played in the Memorial Coliseum and moved to the arena when it was completed in 1995. However, the Winterhawks played home games in both facilities during the season. Moda Center and Winterhawks hold the Western Hockey League&#x27;s record for single game attendance with a crowd of 14,103 on March 15, 1997, in which Portland tied the visiting Seattle Thunderbirds, 6–6. Prior to the start of the 2021-22 WHL season, the Winterhawks announced they will be moving back to Veterans Memorial Coliseum full-time.

The arena was also built to accommodate an NHL franchise and there has been speculation over the years about Portland landing an NHL team; however this has not occurred. A former third tenant was the Portland Lumberjax of the National Lacrosse League, who played four seasons in the arena prior to disbanding.

The arena has hosted numerous other minor league sports teams as well. In 1997, an AFL team landed in Portland from Memphis as the Portland Forest Dragons. Two seasons later, they relocated to Oklahoma City. The arena started hosting another AFL team, the Portland Steel (originally called the Portland Thunder), from 2014 until it disbanded in 2016. From 2000 through 2002, the facility hosted the now-defunct Portland Fire of the WNBA. In the past, the Portland State Vikings men&#x27;s basketball team has played home games in the arena; currently, the team plays its home games at Viking Pavilion on the PSU campus.

On September 18, 2024, the WNBA announced their a new team to play in Portland, which will bring the league back to both the arena and Portland for the first time since 2002.

==History==
In the early 1980s, as the National Basketball Association increased in popularity, it became apparent that the 12,888-seat Memorial Coliseum, which was the home of the Portland Trail Blazers at the time, was no longer an adequate NBA facility. The Trail Blazers had sold out every home game since April 5, 1977. In 1988, the team was purchased by Paul Allen and made appearances in the NBA Finals in 1990 and 1992. Allen soon expressed a desire to build a new arena for his team, and in 1991 chartered the Oregon Arena Corporation, a private corporation with Allen as the sole shareholder, to build and operate a new facility. The team soon made an agreement with the City of Portland to build a new multi-purpose arena on the Coliseum&#x27;s parking lot.

A major factor in the choice of the site for the new arena was its close proximity to transit, with MAX Light Rail and bus service at TriMet&#x27;s Coliseum Transit Center (later renamed Rose Quarter Transit Center) being adjacent to the site. In July 1995, the &quot;Portland Business Journal&quot; quoted the Trail Blazers&#x27; then-president Marshall Glickman as saying, &quot;There is no doubt that transit made it possible for us to build here. The thing that burns everyone in terms of financing big projects like this is parking. The fact that we have a [light rail] stop outside our front door, and the potential for what we&#x27;ll get with the south/north line made this the only place for us to build.&quot; (The &quot;south/north&quot; MAX line referred to was a then-planned line from Clackamas Town Center to Vancouver via downtown Portland, which was canceled in 1996, but partially revived several years later, with the MAX Yellow Line connecting Moda Center with areas to the north.)

===Financing===

The financing of the construction of the facility was widely hailed at the time as a good example of public-private partnership; most of the costs were borne by Allen and/or Allen-owned companies, rather than by taxpayers. The bulk of the $262 million construction costs were funded by a $155 million loan from a consortium of lenders led by pension fund TIAA-CREF. As Allen was unwilling to guarantee the loan with his personal finances, the lenders demanded an interest rate of 8.99%, with no opportunity for prepayment. Other major creditors included Prudential Insurance, and Farmers Insurance.

The remainder of funds came from the City of Portland ($34.5 million), Allen himself ($46 million), with the final $10 million coming from a bond backed by box office and parking revenues. In addition, the City transferred to Allen the underlying land. The city maintains ownership of the Memorial Coliseum and the adjacent parking garages, but the right to manage these was also transferred to Allen. In exchange, Allen signed an exclusive site agreement with the city requiring the Trail Blazers to play all home games in Portland for 30 years The City of Portland hoped that the building of the arena would lead to other renovation or development in the Rose Quarter district, but as of 2021 this has yet to materialize.

===Construction and opening===
Ground on the arena was broken in 1993, and the arena opened on October 12, 1995. The project included the largest construction and demolition recycling program in the U.S. up to that time, in which of construction waste and of dirt were recycled, saving OAC over $127,000. This effort later won the project an environmental award from the city.

The first concert held in the arena was held two weeks after opening, when David Bowie performed on October 25, with Nine Inch Nails opening. The first regular-season game to be played at the facility was the Trail Blazers hosting the then-Vancouver Grizzlies on November 3, 1995, a 92–80 defeat for the home team. The arena was originally capable of seating 20,340 spectators for NBA basketball. Its capacity has since been reduced to 19,393 by subsequent modifications. At the time of its construction, the arena was a state-of-the-art facility. Although more recent NBA arenas have surpassed Moda Center in amenities, it still is well regarded as a facility. A 2005 survey by &quot;USA Today&quot; ranked the facility in the middle of the pack among the 29 NBA arenas; factors unrelated to the venue itself (such as ticket prices and entertainment offerings) are considered in the rankings.

Soon after the arena opened, it was the subject of several lawsuits seeking to enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act. One lawsuit (&quot;United States v. Ellerbe Becket, Inc.&quot;) was filed by the United States Department of Justice against architect Ellerbe-Becket; another (&quot;Independent Living Resources v. Oregon Arena Corporation&quot;) was filed by a disabled advocacy group against OAC. Both lawsuits alleged that Moda Center (and other facilities designed by Ellerbe Becket) did not provide adequate seating for patrons using wheelchairs, and that the line-of-sight of patrons in wheelchairs was frequently obstructed by standing spectators. The first case was settled with a consent decree, wherein Ellerbe Becket agreed to design future projects in compliance with the ADA; the lawsuit against Oregon Arena Corp was resolved in 1998 when OAC agreed to install over one hundred elevated seats permitting wheelchair-using patrons to see over standing spectators in front.

===Oregon Arena Corporation bankruptcy===

Claiming the local economy was responsible for reduced revenues which made it unable to make payments on the loans used to finance construction, the Oregon Arena Corporation filed for bankruptcy on February 27, 2004. After negotiations concurrent with the bankruptcy failed to produce a settlement, the United States Bankruptcy Court ordered on November 8 of that year that the Oregon Arena Corporation transfer the facility to the creditors. A new corporation owned by the creditors, Portland Arena Management (PAM) took over operation of the arena. PAM in turn hired Global Spectrum to operate the arena. For several years, the Trail Blazers (still owned by Allen) and the Portland Arena Management had a highly hostile relationship, with the two entities competing for ticket sales.

The team made numerous complaints about a &quot;broken economic model&quot;, and there was much speculation that the Trail Blazers might leave. The team was put up for sale in the summer of 2006, only to be taken off the market again several months later. Speculation intensified as to what would happen, and the team and Paul Allen were roundly criticized in the media. Despite the criticism and the team&#x27;s poor finances the team insisted that bankruptcy was the right move.

Early in 2007, Allen and the creditors reached an agreement for Allen to repurchase the arena, and the team and the building were united under common ownership once more. After much speculation that Allen would hire Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) to replace Global Spectrum, arena management elected to extend Global Spectrum&#x27;s management contract by one year in the summer of 2007. In September 2007, Global Spectrum announced that the arena would undergo $13 million in renovations.

==Notable events==

While Moda Center has never hosted the NBA Finals (Portland&#x27;s last appearance in the Finals was in 1992, three years before the arena opened), it has hosted three NBA Western Conference Finals series: in 1999 vs. the San Antonio Spurs; in 2000 vs. the Los Angeles Lakers; and in 2019 vs. the Golden State Warriors. One NBA-related event Moda Center—and for that matter, the Trail Blazers franchise—has never hosted is the NBA All-Star Game. The Trail Blazers are one of several franchises to never host an All-Star game; the Blazers&#x27; All-Star drought of 42 years is second only to the Boston Celtics, who last hosted the game in 1964. According to the Oregon Sports Authority, the main issue is hotel space close to the arena; the city of Portland lacks the large &quot;headquarters&quot; hotel needed to host the NBA and media entourage which accompanies the game.

Moda Center has also hosted PBR Built Ford Tough Series bull riding events.

The arena has hosted various WWE events, including Unforgiven in 2004, No Mercy in 2008, and NXT TakeOver: Portland in 2020. The arena has also hosted various episodes of &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

The arena has also hosted UFC 102 in 2009.

In 2004, Portland was selected as one of five cities in the U.S. to host the Dew Action Sports Tour, a new extreme sports franchise to start in 2005. Titled the Vans Invitational, the event was held at the Rose Quarter from August 17 to 21. The Rose Quarter hosted BMX: Dirt and Freestyle Motocross. The Dew Action Sports returned to Portland for a third year.

In the winter of 2005, the Rose Quarter hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, an event attended by over 100,000 spectators. The arena would later host the 2007 NLL All Star Game on March 10, 2007.

In 2009, the arena hosted first- and second-round games of the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament as well as in 2015 and 2022. It was the first time NCAA men&#x27;s tournament games were played in the state of Oregon since 1983, though the arena did host the finals of the 2008 Big Sky Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The state had been under an NCAA-imposed tournament embargo due to sports betting being legal in the state (specifically, the Oregon Lottery&#x27;s &quot;Sports Action&quot; game, a parlay game which allowed bettors to wager on NFL games), but was awarded 2009 tournament games when the state Legislature eliminated Sports Action from the lottery&#x27;s lineup.
In addition to sports, the arena regularly hosts numerous other types of events, including concerts, circuses, ice shows, and conventions. Portland State University holds its spring commencement ceremonies at the arena.

Notable non-sports related events include the 1998 Portland State commencement ceremony, where the keynote speaker was then U.S. President Bill Clinton. The President, speaking before a packed house in the Garden (including a graduating class of 2000), gave a speech embracing immigration to the United States, and was also awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the university.

On June 27, 2000, a concert by former Pink Floyd member Roger Waters at the arena became the basis for the concert video &quot;In the Flesh: Live&quot;.

On April 24, 2012, British rock band Coldplay performed a sold-out show at the arena as part of their Mylo Xyloto Tour. On October 2, 2017, the band came back to the arena during their A Head Full of Dreams Tour. The band covered Free Fallin&#x27; with Peter Buck of R.E.M. there as a tribute to Tom Petty following his death that day.

Lady Gaga performed at the arena on January 15, 2013, as part of her Born This Way Ball tour trek through North America. This was one of the few shows the singer completed in the United States before she was forced to cancel the remainder of the tour due to a labral tear of the hip.

On Sunday, August 9, 2015, Bernie Sanders held a campaign rally at Moda Center that was attended by over 28,000 people.

On April 9, 2017, Radiohead performed at the arena for the first time during their A Moon Shaped Pool tour. It was also their first concert in Portland since 1996.

On October 1, 2019, AJR headlined the theater in Moda Center for their Neotheater World Tour.

The exterior of Moda Center was featured in How I Met Your Mother&#x27;s 2011 episode, Tick Tick Tick; again in the 2013 episode Platonish, and the series finale episode, Last Forever.

The exterior of Moda Center was also featured in iCarly&#x27;s 2009 episode, iFight Shelby Marx.

<doc id="263707" wikidata="Q10341077" url="?curid=263707" title="OpenGL Performer">
<text>OpenGL Performer, formerly known as IRIS Performer and commonly referred to simply as Performer, is a commercial library of utility code built on top of OpenGL for the purpose of enabling hard real-time visual simulation applications. OpenGL Performer was developed by SGI. OpenGL Performer is available for IRIX, Linux, and several versions of Microsoft Windows. Both ANSI C and C++ bindings are available.

==History==

Performer came about in 1991 when a group from SGI&#x27;s Open Inventor project, then known as IRIS Inventor, decided to focus on performance rather than ease of programmability. Whereas Inventor delivered easy-to-use objects and various UI elements to interact with them, Performer focused on a scene graph system that could be re-arranged on the fly for performance reasons, allowing the various passes of a rendering task to be performed in parallel in multiple threads. Performer allowed the scene to describe levels of detail with hysteresis bands and fade capabilities. Frame rate and statistics were monitored and a &#x27;stress&#x27; factor was calculated. This could be used to further weight the level of detail in the scene eliminating detail to maintain a target frame rate.

Other key features of Performer were the use of symmetric multi-processing capabilities, support multiple graphics pipes and the ability to utilize the scalable resources of high end systems. In this regard Performer was actually simple to use given the underlying complexity. Application culling and rendering could be running in different threads locked to different physical processors. In a multi-pipe (multiple graphics subsystems) configuration rendering to each graphics pipe would have a dedicated thread and similarly culling would also have a dedicated processor. Advanced features like database paging, texture paging and point light source management (for flight simulation) and intersection testing for collision detection would also have dedicated processors allowing asynchronous I/O and processing to occur without negatively impacting graphics performance. Most of this complexity was hidden beneath a simpler scene graph API with relatively high level configuration calls which could be made to set up the threads and inter-process communication.

Performer did not have a native file format, merely plugin loaders from 3rd parties such as MultiGen&#x27;s OpenFlight format loader. Similarly there was no default runtime, there was sample code and the often used and often modified &#x27;perfly&#x27; sample application. This probably contributed to its reputation for being difficult to use.

By the mid-1990s it started to become clear that there was no reason that Inventor and Performer could not be combined. This led to the Cosmo 3D project that SGI was intending to build both Inventor and Performer (now essentially API shims) out of, as well as promote as a new and higher-level standardized API for future work on the SGI platform. However, after the first beta release of Cosmo 3D, SGI joined with Intel and IBM (and later DEC) to create OpenGL++, essentially a cleaned up version of Cosmo. This project died when SGI turned their attention to an almost identical project with Microsoft known as Fahrenheit, which was also killed. Today Inventor and Performer remain separate products, and none of the combined versions ever saw the light of day.

==Features==

Performer consists primarily of two libraries: the lower-level &quot;libpr&quot; and the higher-level &quot;libpf.&quot; The &quot;libpr&quot; library provides an object-oriented interface to high-speed rendering functions based on the concept of a &quot;pfGeoSet&quot; and a &quot;pfGeoState&quot;. A &quot;pfGeoSet&quot; is a collection of graphics primitives, such as polygons or lines. A &quot;pfGeoState&quot; encapsulates properties pertaining to a given pfGeoSet such as lighting, transparency, and texturing.

The &quot;libpf&quot; library includes functions for the generation and manipulation of hierarchical scene graphs, scene processing (simulation, intersection, culling, and drawing tasks), level-of-detail management, asynchronous database paging, dynamic coordinate systems, environment models, light points, and so on. This library also provides transparent support for multiple viewports spread across multiple graphics pipelines.

Other Performer libraries--&quot;libpfutil, libpfdb, libpfui,&quot; etc.--provide functions for generating optimized geometry, database conversion, device input (such as for interfacing with external flyboxes and MIL-STD-1553 mux busses), motion models, collision models, and a format-independent database interface that supports common data formats such as Open Inventor, OpenFlight, Designer&#x27;s Workbench, Medit, and Wavefront .obj file.

<doc id="263716" wikidata="Q1068550" url="?curid=263716" title="Chavo Guerrero Sr.">
<text>Salvador Guerrero Llanes (January 7, 1949 – February 11, 2017), better known as Chavo Guerrero or Chavo Guerrero Sr., and also known during the 21st century as &quot;Chavo Classic&quot;, was a Mexican-american professional wrestler. He was best known for his work in Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), American Wrestling Association (AWA), and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and for being the father of third-generation wrestler Chavo Guerrero Jr. He was the oldest son of Salvador &quot;Gory&quot; Guerrero, and part of the Guerrero wrestling family. He was the oldest WWE Cruiserweight Champion.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career (1977–1981)===

In 1977, Chavo competed for NWA Western States. Guerrero later moved his family to California so he could compete in Los Angeles&#x27;s NWA Hollywood Wrestling and San Francisco&#x27;s Big Time Wrestling. In NWA Hollywood, he feuded with Roddy Piper for the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship. Between 1979 and 1980, he held the title 15 times.

===Various territories (1981–1988)===

He spent the early 80&#x27;s splitting his time between All Japan Pro Wrestling, Mid South Wrestling, CWF, and Houston Wrestling. In 1982, Guerrero feuded with Atsushi Onita over the NWA International Junior Heavyweight Championship in All Japan Pro Wrestling. In 1983, he feuded with Gino Hernandez in Mid South Wrestling. The feud resulted in Loser Leaves Town matches, Texas Death Matches and a Mexican Chicken Match. In 1984, he teamed with his brother Hector Guerrero in Championship Wrestling from Florida. They had rivalries with The U.S. Express, from whom they captured the NWA United States Tag Team Titles from and The Breakdancers of Brickhouse Brown and Mark Ragin. In 1985, Hector and Chavo then traveled back over to Mid South Wrestling, where they feuded with The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express. They then engaged in a rivalry with Ted DiBiase and &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Steve Williams over the UWF Tag Team Championship. In 1986, they wrestled The Fabulous Ones on multiple occasions for Mid South.

===AWA and EMLL (1988–1990s)===
In 1988, Mando and Chavo stopped in the AWA. They went after the AWA World Tag Team Championship held by Diamond Dallas Page&#x27;s team of Badd Company (Paul Diamond and Pat Tanaka). However, they were unable to capture the titles in multiple attempts. In 1990, Chavo teamed with his brothers Mando and Eddie in EMLL. He competed with his brothers in multiple trios matches.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2004, 2010)===
In 2004, Guerrero began working for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), joining his son Chavo Jr. in a feud with his younger brother Eddie. While with WWE, he competed as &#x27;Chavo Classic’. On the May 20, 2004 episode of Smackdown, Chavo Classic became the oldest WWE Cruiserweight Champion in history, defeating Chavo Jr. and Spike Dudley in a triple-threat match. On the April 1 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Classic and Chavo Jr. lost to Spike Dudley and Rey Mysterio. On the April 22 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Classic and Chavo Jr defeated John Cena in a 2-on-1 handicap match. On the May 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Chavo Classic defeated Jacqueline thanks to outside help by Chavo Jr. On the June 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Chavo Classic retained the Cruiserweight title against Funaki, thanks to outside help from Chavo Jr. He lost the title to Rey Mysterio less than a month later. On June 15, 2004, he was fired by WWE for no-showing multiple &quot;SmackDown!&quot; house shows. 

On the November 15, 2010, &quot;Old School&quot; episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Guerrero returned as Chavo Classic, driving Alberto Del Rio to the arena.

=== Lucha Underground (2016) ===
Chavo Classic first appeared on Lucha Underground talking with Rey Mysterio about the upcoming match of the latter against his son Chavo Guerrero Jr. in a &quot;Loser Leaves Lucha match&quot;. During the match, Classic, who was in the attendance, turned on Mysterio, helping his son win the match, but Dario Cueto ordered to restart the match, and Mysterio hit the &quot;619&quot; on Classic and defeated Chavo Guerrero, leaving Lucha Underground without the Guerreros.

==Personal life==
Chavo was the son of Gory Guerrero and the older brother of Mando, Hector, and Eddie Guerrero. He grew up in El Paso, Texas He had two children, wrestler Chavo Jr. and daughter Victoria, and he was the brother in-law of Vickie Guerrero.

In July 2016, Guerrero and his son were named as part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE that alleged wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. Over a year after his death, US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.

==Death==
On February 11, 2017, Guerrero died of liver cancer, at the age of 68.

<doc id="263718" wikidata="Q2718421" url="?curid=263718" title="Joe Rogan">
<text>Joseph James Rogan (born August 11, 1967) is an American podcaster, UFC color commentator, comedian, actor, and former television host. He hosts &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;, a podcast in which he discusses current events, comedy, politics, aliens, religion, philosophy, science, martial arts, and hobbies with celebrity guests. His podcast is one of the most influential and most watched podcasts in the world.

Rogan was born in Newark, New Jersey, and began his career in comedy in 1988 in the Boston area. After relocating to Los Angeles in 1994, he signed an exclusive developmental deal with Disney and appeared as an actor on several television shows, including &quot;Hardball&quot; and &quot;NewsRadio.&quot; In 1997, he started working for the UFC as an interviewer and color commentator. He released his first comedy special, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Dead Someday...&quot;, in 2000 and hosted the game show &quot;Fear Factor&quot; from 2001 to 2006.

After leaving &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, Rogan focused on his stand-up career and hosted more comedy specials. He launched &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; in 2009; by 2015, it was one of the most popular podcasts in the world, regularly receiving millions of plays per episode. Spotify obtained exclusive distribution rights to &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; in 2020 for . Rogan&#x27;s audience has since grown significantly, and in 2024, he renewed his deal with Spotify for an estimated , but will no longer be exclusive to them.

Rogan has voiced support for same-sex marriage, recreational drug legalization, universal health care, universal basic income, gun rights, and free speech, while opposing cancel culture and military adventurism. He supported Donald Trump in 2024, having previously endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2020. Rogan has been criticized for promoting conspiracy theories, COVID-19 misinformation, and for hosting guests who spread misinformation and pseudoscience.

== Early life and education ==
Joseph James Rogan was born in Newark, New Jersey, on August 11, 1967. He had one Irish grandparent, while his three other grandparents were all of Italian descent. His parents divorced when he was five, and he has not been in contact with his father, an architect, since he was seven. He recalled, &quot;All I remember of my dad are these brief, violent flashes of domestic violence. But I don&#x27;t want to complain about my childhood. Nothing bad ever really happened to me. I don&#x27;t hate the guy.&quot; At the age of seven, he moved with his mother to San Francisco, California, and when he was 11 they moved to Gainesville, Florida. They later settled in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts. He graduated from Newton South High School in 1985.

Rogan participated in Little League Baseball and developed an interest in martial arts in his early teens. He recalled being &quot;terrified of being a loser&quot; as a child and said, &quot;Martial arts gave me not just confidence, but also a different perspective of myself and what I was capable of. I knew that I could do something I was terrified of, and that was really difficult, and that I could excel at it. It was a big deal for me.&quot; Martial arts were &quot;the first thing that ever gave me hope that I wasn&#x27;t going to be a loser. So I really, really gravitated toward it.&quot; At age 14, he took up karate and started taekwondo a year later. When he was 19, he won the US Open Championship taekwondo tournament as a lightweight. He was a Massachusetts full-contact state champion for four consecutive years and became a taekwondo instructor. He also practiced amateur kickboxing and held a 2–1 record; he retired from competition at age 21, as he began to suffer from frequent headaches and feared he might sustain worse injuries. He attended the University of Massachusetts Boston but found the endeavor &quot;pointless&quot; and dropped out early.

== Career ==
===1988–1994: Early stand-up career===

Rogan had no intention of being a professional comedian, but was a fan of comedy from a young age, later saying of Richard Pryor&#x27;s special &quot;Live on the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;It affected me in such a profound way. Nothing had made me laugh like that.&quot; His friends from gym and Taekwondo school, whom he would make laugh with impressions and jokes, convinced him to try stand-up. At 21, after six months preparing material and practicing his delivery, he performed his first stand-up routine on August 27, 1988, at an open-mic night at a Stitches comedy club in Boston.

While living in Boston and working on his stand-up, Rogan held several jobs to secure himself financially, including teaching martial arts at Boston University and in nearby Revere, delivering newspapers, driving a limousine, doing construction work, and assisting a private investigator. Meanwhile, his blue comedy style earned him gigs at bachelor parties and strip clubs. One night, he persuaded the owner of a comedy club in Boston to allow him to try a new five-minute routine. At the show was talent manager Jeff Sussman, who liked the act and offered to become his manager, which Rogan accepted.

In 1990, Rogan moved to New York City. As a full-time comedian, he was &quot;scratching and grinding&quot; for money and stayed with his grandfather in Newark for the first six months. Rogan later cited Richard Jeni, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison and Bill Hicks as comedy influences.

===1994–1999: &quot;Hardball&quot; and &quot;NewsRadio&quot;===
In 1994, Rogan relocated to Los Angeles, where his first national television spot followed on the MTV comedy show &quot;Half-Hour Comedy Hour&quot;. The appearance led to the network offering him a three-year exclusive contract and a role in a pilot episode of a &quot;dopey game show&quot; for . Rogan declined, but it prompted Sussman to send tapes of Rogan&#x27;s performances to several networks, which sparked a bidding war. After a period of negotiation, Rogan accepted a development deal with the Disney network. He secured his first major acting role in the 1994 nine-episode Fox sitcom &quot;Hardball&quot; as Frank Valente, a young, egocentric star player on a professional baseball team. Rogan called the hiring process &quot;weird&quot;, as the network had no idea if he could act until he was asked by Dean Valentine, then-president of Walt Disney Television, to whom he replied: &quot;If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure&quot;. The filming schedule was a new experience for Rogan, who started to work 12-hour days. Rogan later said: &quot;It was a great show on paper until a horrible executive producer with a big ego was hired by Fox to run the show and he rewrote it&quot;. Around this time, Rogan began performing at The Comedy Store in Hollywood and was hired as a paid regular by owner Mitzi Shore. According to Rogan, he performed at the club for the next 13 years for free and paid for the venue&#x27;s new sound system.

From 1995 to 1999, Rogan starred in the NBC sitcom &quot;NewsRadio&quot; as Joe Garrelli, an electrician and handyman at the show&#x27;s fictional news radio station. The role was originally set to be played by actor Ray Romano, but Romano was let go from the cast after one rehearsal and Rogan was brought in. The switch caused Rogan to work with the show&#x27;s writers to help develop the character before the show was set to launch, which he later described as a &quot;very dumbed-down, censored version&quot; of himself. Rogan befriended fellow cast member Phil Hartman, who confided his marital problems to him. Rogan claimed he tried to persuade Hartman to divorce his wife five times, but &quot;he loved his kids and didn&#x27;t want to leave&quot;. In 1998, Hartman was murdered by his wife. The loss affected Rogan&#x27;s ability to perform stand-up, and he canceled a week of scheduled gigs. Rogan later saw acting as an easy job, but grew tired of &quot;playing the same character every week&quot;, and only did so for the money. He later viewed his time on &quot;NewsRadio&quot; as &quot;a dream gig&quot; that allowed him to earn money while working on his stand-up as often as he could. During the series, he worked on a pilot for a show entitled &quot;Overseas&quot;.

===1997–2006: UFC commentator and &quot;Fear Factor&quot;===

Rogan began working for the mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship as a backstage and post-fight interviewer. His first show took place at &quot;UFC 12: Judgement Day&quot; in Dothan, Alabama, on February 7, 1997. He became interested in Brazilian jiu-jitsu in 1994 after watching Royce Gracie fight at &quot;UFC 2: No Way Out&quot;, and landed the position at the organization as Sussman was friends with its co-creator and original producer, Campbell McLaren. He quit after two years as his salary could not cover the cost of traveling to the events, which were often held in rural locations.

After the UFC was taken over by Zuffa in 2001, Rogan attended some events and became friends with its new president Dana White, who offered him a job as a color commentator. However, Rogan initially declined as he &quot;just wanted to go to the fights and drink&quot;. In 2002, White was able to hire Rogan for free in exchange for prime event tickets for him and his friends. After about 15 free gigs as a commentator, Rogan accepted pay for the job, working alongside Mike Goldberg until the end of 2016. Rogan won the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Award for Best Television Announcer twice, and was named MMA Personality of the Year four times by the World MMA Awards.

In 1999, Rogan secured a three-album deal with Warner Bros. Records and began tentative plans to star in his own prime-time televised sitcom on Fox named &quot;The Joe Rogan Show&quot;. The show, co-written by &quot;Seinfeld&quot; writer Bill Masters, was to feature Rogan as &quot;a second-string sportscaster who lands a spot as the token male on a &quot;View&quot;-style women&#x27;s show&quot;. In December 1999, he recorded his first stand-up comedy album in two shows at the Comedy Connection at Faneuil Hall in Boston, which was released as &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Dead Some Day...&quot; in August 2000. It received national exposure on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; and downloads from Napster. &quot;Voodoo Punanny&quot;, a song Rogan wrote after Warner suggested to produce a song they could play on the radio, was subsequently released as a single. Around this time, Rogan also worked on ideas for a film and a cartoon with his comedian friend Chris McGuire, and began to operate a blog on his website, JoeRogan.net, which he used to discuss various topics that helped him develop his stand-up routines.

In 2001, the development of Rogan&#x27;s television show was interrupted after he accepted an offer from NBC to host the American edition of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;. He declined initially as he thought the network would not air such a program due to its content, but Sussman convinced him to accept. Rogan later said that the main reason he accepted was to obtain observations and anecdotes for his stand-up comedy. The show increased Rogan&#x27;s national exposure which caused turnouts at his stand-up gigs to grow. &quot;Fear Factor&quot; ran for an initial six seasons from 2001 to 2006.

Rogan&#x27;s role as host of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; led to further television opportunities. In 2002, he appeared on the episode &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; of &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot; as Chris, the boyfriend of lead character Maya Gallo. In December 2002, Rogan was the emcee for the 2002 Blockbuster Hollywood Spectacular, a Christmas parade in Hollywood. In February 2003, Rogan became the new co-host of &quot;The Man Show&quot; on Comedy Central for its fifth season from August 2003, with fellow comedian Doug Stanhope, following the departure of original hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Carolla. A year into the show, however, the hosts entered disagreements with Comedy Central and the show&#x27;s producers over content. Rogan recalled: &quot;I was a little misled ... I was told: &#x27;Show nudity, and we&#x27;ll blur it out. Swear and we&#x27;ll bleep it out.&#x27; That hasn&#x27;t been the case&quot;. The show ended in 2004. Around this time Rogan entered talks to host his own radio show, but they came to nothing due to his already busy schedule.

===2005–2009: Comedy specials===
In 2005, actor Wesley Snipes challenged Rogan to a cage fight. Rogan trained for the event for five months before Snipes backed out following an investigation by the IRS for alleged tax evasion. Rogan believed Snipes needed a quick payout to alleviate his debt.

After &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, Rogan focused his career on his stand-up comedy, as concentrating on television had made him feel lazy and uninspired to work on new material for his act. With the money he had earned from television, Rogan hired two people full-time to film him and his comedy friends on tour, and release clips on his website for his &quot;JoeShow&quot; web series. In May 2005, Rogan signed a deal with the Endeavor Talent Agency. Two months later, he filmed his second stand-up comedy special, &quot;Joe Rogan: Live&quot;, in Phoenix, Arizona. The special premiered on &quot;Showtime&quot; in 2007.

In 2005, Rogan wrote a blog entry on his website accusing comedian Carlos Mencia of joke thievery, a claim he had made since 1993. The situation culminated in February 2007 when Rogan confronted Mencia on stage at The Comedy Store in Hollywood. A video of the incident was uploaded onto YouTube and included evidence and comments from other comedians, including George Lopez, &quot;The Reverend&quot; Bob Levy, Bobby Lee, and Ari Shaffir. The incident led to Rogan&#x27;s talent agent expelling him as a client of The Gersh Agency, who also managed Mencia, and his ban from The Comedy Store, causing him to relocate his regular venue to the Hollywood Improv Comedy Club. Rogan later said that every comic he had talked to was happy and thankful that he did it, and went on to sign with William Morris Agency.

In April 2007, Comedy Central Records released Rogan&#x27;s fourth comedy special, &quot;Shiny Happy Jihad&quot;. The set was recorded in September 2006 at Cobb&#x27;s Comedy Club in San Francisco, and contains excerpts of an improvized Q&amp;A session with the audience that was typical of Rogan&#x27;s act at the time.

===2009–present: Latest endeavors and podcast===

Rogan hosted the short-lived CBS show &quot;Game Show in My Head&quot;, which aired for eight episodes in January 2009. It was produced by Ashton Kutcher. The show involved contestants who try to convince people to perform or take part in increasingly bizarre situations for money. He agreed to host the show as the idea intrigued him, calling it &quot;a completely mindless form of entertainment&quot;.

In 2010, Rogan accused comedian Dane Cook of joke thievery.

In 2011, Rogan resumed his role as &quot;Fear Factor&quot; host for its seventh and final season (until 2012). Rogan took the job, saying he &quot;would hate to see somebody else do it&quot;. Later in 2011, Rogan played his first major film character, Gale, in the comedy film &quot;Zookeeper&quot;. He was also working on a book around this time that he tentatively titled &quot;Irresponsible Advice from a Man with No Credibility&quot;, based on his blog entries on his website. Rogan played himself in &quot;Here Comes the Boom&quot;, another action-comedy film starring Kevin James that was released in 2012.

In December 2012, Rogan released his sixth comedy special &quot;Live from the Tabernacle&quot; exclusively as a download on his website for , following Louis C.K.&#x27;s example.

In 2013, Rogan hosted the television show &quot;Joe Rogan Questions Everything&quot; on the SyFy network, which aired for six episodes. The show covered topics discussed on his podcasts, including the existence of Bigfoot and UFOs, and featured several comedians, experts, and scientists with the aim of trying to &quot;put some subjects to bed ... with an open-minded perspective&quot;. SyFy agreed to produce the show without a pilot episode. The production team gave Rogan some creative control over the program and aimed to present it in his own words where possible.

====&quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;====

In December 2009, Rogan launched a free podcast with his friend and fellow comedian Brian Redban. The first episode was recorded on December 24 and was to be a live weekly broadcast on Ustream, with Rogan and Redban &quot;sitting in front of laptops bullshitting&quot;. By August 2010, the podcast was named &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; and entered the list of Top 100 podcasts on iTunes and in 2011, was picked up by SiriusXM Satellite Radio. The podcast features an array of guests who discuss current events, politics, philosophy, comedy, hobbies, and numerous other topics. By January 2015, the podcast reached over 11 million monthly downloads. By October that year, the podcast was downloaded 16 million times each month, making it one of the most popular free podcasts.

On May 19, 2020, Rogan announced that he had signed a multiyear licensing deal with Spotify worth an estimated , making it one of the largest licensing agreements in the podcast business. The deal made &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; available on Spotify starting September 1, 2020, and exclusive on the platform from January 2021. The podcast is available with both audio and video within the Spotify app and video is no longer streamed or uploaded to YouTube. The podcasts are typically released one day after recording, to allow time for the producers to make clips of the podcast. Clips from the video version will continue to be available on YouTube. In February 2022, Spotify removed 113 episodes of &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; over the course of a few days owing in part to some of the episodes having been perceived to have racist and insensitive language.

In February 2022, singer India Arie shared a compilation of Rogan saying the racial slur &quot;nigger&quot; on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; on Instagram. Rogan apologized, calling his past language &quot;regretful and shameful&quot; while also saying that the clips were taken out of context and that he only quoted the slur to discuss its use by others. The footage in question was first published by the political action committee PatriotTakes, an affiliate of the liberal PAC MeidasTouch. This resulted in allegations of a defamation attempt by MeidasTouch, which the founders denied in an interview with Barstool Sports founder David Portnoy, instead attributing the source of the footage to Alex Jones who was a recurring guest on Rogan&#x27;s show. Rogan described the video compilation as a &quot;political hit job&quot;. A number of UFC fighters, including Israel Adesanya, Terrance McKinney, Michael Chandler, Aljamain Sterling, Frankie Edgar, Darren Till, Marlon Vera, Ben Askren, and Brendan Schaub, defended Rogan.

Spotify had refused to carry 42 episodes of the podcast when it acquired the exclusive rights. Spotify says it spoke to Rogan about his &quot;history of using some racially insensitive language&quot;, and it says (in an internal memo) that Rogan selected 70 episodes which were removed on February 4, 2022, all of which pre-date the COVID-19 pandemic.

In early 2022, the video platform Rumble offered Rogan to switch from Spotify. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Rogan had declined the offer.

In December 2024, Spotify confirmed that The Joe Rogan Experience was the top podcast on its platform for a fifth consecutive year.

====Onnit====
Rogan is a co-founder of the supplements and fitness company Onnit, which was sold to Unilever in 2021. Rogan frequently advertises for Onnit products on his podcast. In April 2024 a lawsuit was filed against Onnit, alleging that its &#x27;Alpha BRAIN&#x27; supplement performed no better than a placebo in a clinical study and that the product was surrounded by &quot;false, misleading and deceptive advertising&quot;.

====Comedy Mothership====
Rogan is also the owner of the Comedy Mothership comedy club in Austin, Texas, which opened in March 2023.

== Views ==
=== Political views ===

In 2020, CNN described Rogan as &quot;libertarian-leaning&quot;. In 2019–20, Rogan described himself as socially liberal, saying he supports same-sex marriage, gay rights, women&#x27;s rights, recreational drug use, universal health care, universal basic income, gun rights, and the Second Amendment. He describes himself as a strong supporter of freedom of speech, and has criticized cancel culture and what he perceives to be suppression of those who hold right-wing views in the television and film industry. He has also criticized what he describes as an American foreign policy of military adventurism. 

In 2020, Rogan endorsed left-wing Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, saying &quot;I believe in him, I like him, I like him a lot&quot;. In 2022, Rogan said Republican Ron DeSantis would be &quot;a good president&quot;. On November 4, 2024, the day before the 2024 United States presidential election, Rogan endorsed Republican candidate Donald Trump. He said that Elon Musk, who had been on Rogan&#x27;s podcast a couple of days prior, &quot;makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you&#x27;ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way&quot;.

Rogan opposes Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, calling him &quot;a fucking dictator&quot;, and called Canada &quot;communist&quot; while admitting that he has &quot;zero understanding&quot; of Canada&#x27;s political system. Rogan also said that he liked Trudeau prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In March 2024, Rogan described Israel&#x27;s actions in the Gaza Strip as a &quot;genocide&quot;. In a podcast with writer Coleman Hughes eight days later, where Hughes disputed the genocide allegations, Rogan said he appreciated Hughes&#x27; perspective, saying: &quot;You clearly know more about it than I do&quot;.

Rogan described the way that President Vladimir Putin leads Russia as &quot;evil&quot; but &quot;impressive&quot;. He called Putin a &quot;strong leader&quot; and said &quot;Isn&#x27;t there always a longing for a strong man&quot;. In November 2024, Rogan said the Russian invasion of Ukraine was &quot;100% wrong&quot;. He criticized outgoing US President Joe Biden for allowing Ukraine to strike back at mainland Russia with US-supplied missiles. He also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying &quot;Fuck you, man. You fucking people are about to start world war three&quot;. Ukrainian world heavyweight boxing champion, Wladimir Klitschko, accused Rogan of &quot;repeating Russian propaganda&quot;. Klitschko posted a video offering to debate Rogan on his podcast &quot;like free men&quot;.

=== Drugs and spirituality ===
Rogan supports the legalized use of cannabis and believes it holds numerous benefits. He hosted the documentary film &quot;The Union: The Business Behind Getting High&quot; and was featured in &quot;Marijuana: A Chronic History&quot; and &quot;The Culture High&quot;. He also supports the use of LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and DMT toward the exploration and enhancement of consciousness, as well as introspection. He was the presenter in the 2010 documentary &quot;&quot;.

Rogan has an interest in sensory deprivation and using an isolation tank. He has stated that his personal experiences with meditation in isolation tanks have helped him explore the nature of consciousness and improve his performance in various physical and mental activities and overall well-being.

=== COVID-19 and vaccines ===

In April 2021, Rogan made contentious remarks about COVID-19 vaccines, in particular claiming that young, healthy people do not need to be vaccinated against the virus. This view was criticized by Anthony Fauci and White House communication director Kate Bedingfield, as well as by several media outlets. Part of the objection was that there have been notable cases affecting young, healthy people. Rogan acknowledged there was &quot;some legitimate science&quot; behind Fauci&#x27;s view and emphasized that he is not a doctor and should not be taken as &quot;a respected source of information&quot;.

On September 1, 2021, Rogan tested positive for the virus. Soon after, he released an online video reporting on the status of his condition and stating that he had begun a regimen including monoclonal antibodies, prednisone, azithromycin, NAD drip, a vitamin drip, as well as ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug that is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. This drew controversy due to multiple people reportedly being hospitalized after self-medicating with an over-the-counter form of ivermectin designed to treat ailments in livestock, which typically has a significantly larger dosage. Rogan criticized CNN for describing ivermectin as a &quot;horse dewormer&quot;. On Rogan&#x27;s podcast, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta said that ivermectin is used to treat diseases caused by parasites but that CNN should not have implied that Rogan was taking a veterinary drug since Rogan acquired it through a doctor. On September 3, 2021, Rogan tested negative for the virus.

In January 2022, 270 scientists, physicians, professors, doctors, and healthcare workers wrote an open letter to Spotify expressing concern over &quot;false and societally harmful assertions&quot; on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; and asked Spotify to &quot;establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform&quot;. The 270 signatories took issue with Rogan &quot;broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic&quot; and more specifically &quot;a highly controversial episode&quot; featuring guest Robert W. Malone (#1757)&quot;, a biochemist who has promoted vaccine misinformation.

The episode was criticized for promoting conspiracy theories, including &quot;an unfounded theory that societal leaders have &#x27;hypnotized&#x27; the public&quot;. The signatories wrote that &quot;Dr. Malone is one of two recent JRE guests who has compared pandemic policies to the Holocaust. These actions are not only objectionable and offensive, but also medically and culturally dangerous.&quot; The signatories also note that Malone was suspended from Twitter &quot;for spreading misinformation about COVID-19&quot;.

On January 24, 2022, the songwriter Neil Young posted an open letter demanding that Spotify remove his music from their service if they would not remove &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; from their service. Young wrote that &quot;Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform&quot;. On January 26, Spotify removed Young&#x27;s music; a spokesperson said Spotify wanted &quot;all the world&#x27;s music and audio content to be available to Spotify users&quot; and that it had a &quot;great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators&quot;. On January 29, the songwriter Joni Mitchell removed her catalog from Spotify in support of Young and &quot;the global scientific and medical communities on this issue&quot;.

Responding to the controversy, Rogan denied intentionally spreading misinformation and pledged &quot;to try to balance out these more controversial viewpoints with other people&#x27;s perspectives&quot;, and said that he agreed with Spotify adding a disclaimer to the beginning of his videos.

On January 10, 2025, Joe Rogan published an interview with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, where Zuckerberg alleged that the Biden administration had pressured Facebook to remove content related to the COVID-19 vaccine.

=== Other views, medical misinformation and advocacy ===
Rogan is an avid hunter and is part of the &quot;Eat What You Kill&quot; movement, which attempts to move away from factory farming and the mistreatment of animals raised for food.

Rogan has been an outspoken critic of transgender women competing in women&#x27;s sports, including MMA matches. In April 2022, he said that transgender swimmer Lia Thomas &quot;might be the woke straw that breaks society&#x27;s camel&#x27;s back&quot;. Rogan has offered a critique of transgender martial arts artist Fallon Fox, saying &quot;If you had a dick at one point in time, you also have all the bone structure that comes with having a dick. You have bigger hands, you have bigger shoulder joints. You&#x27;re a fucking man&quot;.

In October 2022, while interviewing Tulsi Gabbard on his show, Rogan shared the widely discredited litter boxes in schools hoax, claiming that public schools were providing litter boxes to students who dress up as cats. Rogan said several weeks later that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t seem that there&#x27;s any proof that they put a litter box in there&quot;, but falsely claimed that there were discussions considering the idea.

During an episode of his podcast in February 2023, Rogan stated the &quot;idea that Jewish people are not into money is ridiculous. That&#x27;s like saying Italians aren&#x27;t into pizza. It&#x27;s fucking stupid.&quot; Rogan made the comment in defense of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who faced allegations of antisemitism for saying that political support for Israel was &quot;all about the benjamins&quot;. Jonathan Greenblatt, the Director of the Anti-Defamation League, condemned Rogan&#x27;s comment as reflecting &quot;antisemitic tropes about Jews and money&quot;.

In a February 2024 podcast with Bret Weinstein, Rogan promoted the debunked claim that party drugs such as poppers were &quot;a very important factor in AIDS&quot;, and falsely claimed that the antiviral drug AZT killed people &quot;quicker&quot; than AIDS itself. Rogan and Weinstein also praised AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg, saying that he had been &quot;demonized&quot; for his arguments about AZT. The American Foundation for AIDS Research reacted by saying, &quot;The fact is that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), untreated, causes AIDS&quot; and criticizing the podcast for &quot;disseminating false information&quot;.

<text>In demonology, Furfur (other spelling: Furtur, Ferthur) is a powerful Great Earl of Hell, being the ruler of twenty-six legions of demons. He is a liar even when compelled to enter a magic triangle, where he answers questions, speaking with a rough voice. Furfur causes love between a man and a woman, creates storms, tempests, thunder, lightning, and teaches on secret and divine things.

He is depicted as a deer or winged deer, and also as an angel. To some authors he changes from deer into angel when compelled to enter the magic triangle.

== Furfur in Latin ==
&#x27;Furfur&#x27; or &#x27;furfures&#x27; in Latin means &quot;bran&quot;. However it seems more likely that the name is a corruption of &#x27;furcifer&#x27;, the Latin word for scoundrel.

== In popular culture ==
*Furfur is portrayed as a horned, red-skinned man in the anime and manga series Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun. 
*He makes brief optional appearances as a passive antagonist in the video game Voices of the Void.
*Furfur is also a character in the comedy tv series Good Omens, and is depicted as a demon working for hell.
*Furfur and Zepar are depicted in Umineko When They Cry as androgynous twin demons who are friends of the witch Beatrice.

<text>In demonology, Marchosias is a great and mighty Marquis of Hell, commanding thirty legions of demons. In the Ars Goetia, the first book of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; (17th century), he is depicted as a wolf with griffin wings and a serpent&#x27;s tail, spewing fire from his mouth. At the request of the magician, he may take the form of a man. He is a strong fighter, gives true answers to all questions, and is very faithful to the magician in following his commands. Before his fall, he belonged to the angelic order of Dominations (or Dominions), and when he was bound by Solomon, he told him that after 1,200 years, he hoped to return to Heaven (&quot;unto the Seventh Throne&quot;).

In the &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (1577) of Johann Weyer, the demon is called Marchocias, and his description is much the same as that given in the Goetia except that his gender when appearing as a wolf is female (&quot;a cruel she-wolf&quot;) and spewing forth &quot;I cannot tell what&quot; from his mouth. He likewise hopes to eventually return to the Seventh Throne, but is &quot;deceived in that hope.&quot;

Collin de Plancy in his &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot; (1818) draws on both sources for his description of Marchosias in his catalogue of demons.

The name Marchosias comes from the Late Latin &quot;marchio&quot;, &quot;marquis&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In James Blish&#x27;s apocalyptic novel &quot;Black Easter&quot;, black magician Theron Ware demonstrates his powers to sceptical arms-dealer Baines by performing a &quot;sending&quot; of Marchosias to cause the suicide by poison of an eminent physicist. The goetic ceremony of evocation is described with a vividness and a meticulous attention to detail unusual in a work of fiction.

Marchosias appears in the &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; season 5 episode &quot;Ship Broken&quot;, where he is a hellhound that was previously the dog of famed serial killer Son of Sam.

In &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Curse&quot; by Kelley Armstrong, a demon claiming to be Marchosias appears with her hell beasts and she claims to be the creator of werewolves. This is said by a werewolf to be one of many legends as to their creation and that he doesn&#x27;t know or care if the demon is actually Marochosias.

The ASW-G-35 Gundam Marchosias &amp; The Asw-G-05 Gundam Marbas (ガンダムマルコシアス) (ガンダムナルバス) is a mobile suit from the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans Urdr-Hunt&quot; mobile game and is one of the 72 Gundam Frames created during the &quot;Calamity War&quot;.

The Marchosias Team is a team of aces from the Principality of Zeon in the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Side Story: Missing Link&quot; video game, formed from characters who are unfit for service in the regular forces.

In &quot;Genshin Impact&quot;, it is revealed that Marchosius (), now Guoba (), was the God of the Stove and Patron God of the Soil. Following a series of calamities, he used up his power to vitalize the land, greatly reducing his physical size and intelligence.

In &quot;Myriad Colors Phantom World&quot;, Marchosias is a phantom that the main character summons to combat other phantoms.

<text>In demonology, Phenex is a Goetic demon. A Great Marquis of Hell he has twenty legions of demons under his command. He teaches all wonderful sciences, is an excellent poet, and is very obedient to the conjuror. Phenex hopes to return to Heaven after 1,200 years.

==Description==
He is depicted as a phoenix, which sings sweet notes with the voice of a child, but the conjurer and anyone with him must not listen and quickly ask him to put on a human shape, which the demon supposedly does after a certain amount of time.

==In conjuring==
The 17th-century spellbook, &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; describes this spirit as follows:
Phoenix is a great marquesse, appearing like the bird Phoenix, having a child&#x27;s voice: but before he standeth still before the conjuror, he singeth many sweet notes. Then the exorcist with his companions must beware he give no ear to the melody, but must by and by bid him put on humane shape; then will he speak marvelously of all wonderful sciences. He is an excellent poet, and obedient, he hopeth to return to the seventh throne after a thousand two hundredth years, and governeth twenty legions.

&quot;Other spellings&quot;: Pheynix, Phoenix, Phoeniex.

<text>Frances Xavier Cabrini (; born Maria Francesca Cabrini; July 15, 1850 – December 22, 1917), also known as Mother Cabrini, was a prominent Italian-American religious sister in the Roman Catholic Church. She was the first American to be recognized by the Vatican as a saint.

Cabrini founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (MSC), a religious institute that today provides education, health care, and other services to the poor in 15 nations. During her lifetime, Cabrini established 67 schools, orphanages and other social service institutions in Italy, the United States and other nations. She became a revered and influential figure in the Catholic hierarchy in the United States and Rome.

Born in Italy, Cabrini migrated to the United States in 1887. Despite anti-Italian prejudice and opposition within the Catholic Church, she successfully established charitable institutions in New York City for poor Italian immigrants. She later extended these efforts to Italian immigrant populations across the United States. Catholic leaders were soon calling on her to create missions in Latin America and Europe.

Cabrini became a naturalized American citizen in 1909. After her death in 1917, her order started a campaign for her sainthood. The Vatican beatified Cabrini in 1938 and canonized her a saint in 1946. The Vatican in 1950 named her as the patron saint of immigrants.

==Life in Italy==

=== Early years ===
Maria Francesca Cabrini was born on July 15, 1850, in Sant&#x27;Angelo Lodigiano, in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, then part of the Austrian Empire. She was the youngest of the 13 children of farmer Agostino Cabrini and his wife Stella Oldini. Only four of her siblings survived beyond adolescence.

Born two months prematurely, Frances Cabrini was small and weak as a child and remained in delicate health throughout her life. During her childhood, she visited an uncle, Don Luigi Oldini of Livraga, a priest who lived beside a canal. While in Livrage, she made little paper boats, dropped violets she called &quot;missionaries&quot; in the boats, and launched them in the stream to sail to India and China. Cabrina made her first holy communion at age nine. On one occasion, she fell into the river and was swept downstream. Her rescuers found her on a riverbank. Cabrini attributed her rescue to divine intervention.

Cabrini&#x27;s older sister Rosa was a teacher, which influenced her to follow the same career path. At age 13, Cabrini attended a school in Arluno, Lombardy, that was run by the Daughters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. In 1868, she graduated &quot;&quot; from the school with a teaching certificate and returned to Sant&#x27;Angelo Lodigiano to teach at the parish school. She later worked for three more years as a substitute teacher at a school in Castiraga Vidardo in Lombardy.

After Cabrini&#x27;s parents died in 1870, she applied for admission to the Daughters of the Sacred Heart at Arluno. However, the sisters rejected Cabrini because they believed her health wasn&#x27;t strong enough. In 1872, while working with the sick during a smallpox outbreak, she contracted the disease and was rejected by the Canossian Sisters of Crema, again due to health reasons. It was reported, however, that the priest in Cabrini&#x27;s parish asked the two orders to deny her application because he did not want to lose her as a teacher.

=== Orphanage in Italy ===

In 1874, a priest in Codogno, Lombardy, invited Cabrini to take over a poorly-run orphanage operated by the Sisters of Providence in that town. After arriving in Codogno, Cabrini took religious vows into Sisters of Providence, finally achieving her goal of becoming a religious sister. She added Xavier (&quot;Saverio&quot; in Italian) to her name to honor Reverend Francis Xavier, the patron saint of missionary service. Like Xavier, her ultimate ambition was to become a missionary in East Asia. However, the two Providence sisters in charge of the orphanage finances were jealous of Cabrini and worked to thwart her actions.

In 1880, due to their turmoil, the Providence Sisters in Codogno dissolved and the orphanage closed. Cabrini then spoke with the bishop of the Diocese of Lodi, Domenico Gelmini, about her future. He told Cabrini that she should pursue her dream of becoming a missionary, but that did not know of any religious orders that would train her. Cabrini responded by saying that she would start her own missionary order.

Cabrini bought a former Franciscan convent in Codogno. With several of the former Providence sisters, Cabrini in November 1880 founded the Institute of the Salesian Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC). At the Codogno convent, the MSC sisters took in orphans and foundlings, opened a day school, started classes in needlework, and sold their fine embroidery. Over the next five years, the MSC sisters established seven homes, a free school and a nursery in Lombardy.

In early 1887, with the blessing of Bishop Giovanni Scalabrini of Piacenza, Cabrini opened a convent in Castel San Giovanni in the Emilia-Romagna region. Scalabrini had recently found the Scalabrinian Missionaries, an order of priests to perform missionary work with Italian immigrants in New York City. He believed that the MSC sisters would be of tremendous assistance to the priests in their work. He asked Calabrini to consider opening an orphanage in New York. Countess Mary Reid DiCesnola, a wealthy Catholic socialite in Manhattan, had been relentlessly petitioning both the pope and Archbishop Michael Corrigan of New York to open an orphanage there for Italian girls, which she would fund. Cabrini still wanted to go to Asia, but also wanted to open a religious home in Rome and gain papal approval for MSC. She allowed Scalabrini set up a meeting with Pope Leo XIII.

==Papal recognition==

In September 1887, Cabrini went to Rome to meet Leo XIII. She asked him for permission to set up a convent in Rome, which he readily gave. She also asked for permission to send missions to Asia. However, Leo XIII was thinking of a different destination.

During the 1880s, the pope and the rest of the Roman Curia were worried about the large numbers of impoverished Italian immigrants emigrating to New York. Leo was concerned that these Catholics would leave the church unless they received material assistance and spiritual guidance. Instead of allowing Cabrini to go to China, Leo XIII told her, go &quot;...not to the East, but to the West...&quot; to New York City.

In December 1888, Cabrini committed to going to New York City. The pope also recognized the MSC as a missionary institute, the first group of Italian religious sisters to receive that approval. Scalabrini promised Cabrini that his religious order, Scalabrinians would greet the MSC sisters in New York City, take care of their needs, and work closely with them.

== Mission in New York ==

=== Arrival ===
Corrigan wrote to Cabrini in February 1889, welcoming her to New York City, but advising her to delay her departure to allow more time for preparation. However, when the letter reached Italy, Cabrini was already gone. At age 38, Cabrini sailed for the United States, arriving in New York City on March 31, 1889, with six other MSC sisters. When they disembarked from the ship, the Scalabrinians were not there. Furthermore, they had failed to set up accommodations for them. The sisters spent their first night in the United States in a decrepit rooming house with bed bugs in the mattresses, forcing them to sleep on chairs.

During this period, the Catholic hierarchy and clergy in New York City were dominated by Irish immigrants who share a common prejudice against Italians. Many of the Irish Catholics considered the Italians to be dirty, superstitious and almost pagan. Many of the Irish-run parishes segregated Italian worshippers in church basements. The archdiocese had very few Italian priests, hindering communication with the Italians. Corrigan, also Irish, believed that only men were suitable for missionary work with immigrants. He had wanted the Vatican to just send him Italian priests, not religious sisters.

=== Meeting with archbishop ===

The day after arriving in New York, Cabrini and the other sisters walked into Corrigan&#x27;s office. Totally surprised that they were in New York, Corrigan told Cabrini that the archdiocese was unready for them and that they should immediately return to Italy. Cabrini refused to go back, simply saying, “I have letters from the pope”, and gave her letters of introduction to Corrigan. Unwilling to defy a papal mandate, Corrigan could not force the MSC sisters to leave.

Corrigan asked Cabrini to establish a schools for Italians first and wait on the orphanage. After the meeting with Corrigan, the Sisters of Charity in the Bronx gladly provided temporary residence for Cabrini and her entourage at their convent. After much delay, the Scalabrinian priests provided a rundown convent for the MSC sisters in the Five Points area of Manhattan.

=== Mission work ===

Soon after their arrival in the city, the MSC sisters started experiencing degrading, anti-Italian slurs and insults. Cabrini wrote back to the sisters in Italy, asking that they send over fabrics for the making of additional veils and habits. She wanted her sisters to be cleanly dressed, “otherwise they will call us ‘guinea-pigs’ the way they do to the Italians here.”

Cabrini and the MSC sisters started knocking on tenement doors in Little Italy in Manhattan. At that time, many Italian immigrants in New York were suspicious of the institutional Catholic Church, sentiments fostered by the government of the newly unified Italy. Their loyalties lay more with their personal saints. In addition, as most of the immigrants came from Sicily, Calabria and other southern regions, they were initially suspicious of the MSC sisters, who all originated from Lombardy in Northern Italy.

With the help of sisters from the other religious orders in New York, the MSC sisters started tending the sick, teaching children and feeding the hungry. They set up a makeshift school for 200 children in the balcony of a local Catholic church. Soon the merchants in Little Italy started providing the sisters with food and funding to support their mission.

With Corrigan&#x27;s blessing and funding from DiCesnola, Cabrini opened the Sacred Heart Orphan Asylum on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. This was her first orphanage in the United States. However, the high cost of running the orphanage in the city, plus increasing friction with Corrigan, soon prompted Cabrini to move it to the countryside.

=== First orphanage in United States ===

In 1890, Cabrini purchased a property from the Jesuits in West Park, New York, where she relocated the orphanage. She also established an MSC novitiate on the property. The West Park campus became St. Cabrini Home, the MSC headquarters in the United States and a boarding school. At that time, other orphanages would automatically force girls to leave once they turned age 14. Cabrini refused to do that. She insisted that the orphanages only discharge the girls if they were placed with an adoptive family or trained to earn an independent living.

Cabrini once wrote:“What we as women cannot do on a large scale to help solve grave social ills is being done in our small sphere of influence in every state and city where we have opened houses. In them we shelter and care for orphans, the sick and the poor.”Although she moved the MSC order to West Park, Cabrini continued to work in New York City. The Scalabrinians thwarted her efforts to build a school there. However, she joined with them in 1890 to build the first hospital in the city for Italians. She brought ten MSC sisters from Italy to staff the hospital, which opened in 1891.

== Other missions ==

As Cabrini&#x27;s reputation grew, she started receiving requests for help on Catholic projects outside New York for both Italian and non-Italian Catholics. She sailed in 1891 to Nicaragua to open a religious house. While there, she traveled by boat into a remote area to visit a settlement of Miskito people. Arriving in Chile, she traveled by mule over the Andes Mountains to found schools in Brazil and Argentina. She also went to Grenada to start a school.

The final destination in her first mission trip was New Orleans in 1892, where she set up another school for Italians. The area was a hotbed of anti-Catholic sentiment, combined with racial discrimination against immigrants from Southern Italy, who locals believed did not &quot;look White&quot; In 1891, a large mob forcibly removed 11 Italian men in jail and killed them. The MSC sisters established a mission in the poorest Italian neighborhood in the city.

Cabrini was forced to return early to New York from New Orleans in later 1892 because the new hospital there was facing closure. The Scalabrinians had mismanaged the hospital and were trying to transfer its debts to MSC. After pulling the sisters from that hospital, she spent $250 to found the Columbus Hospital in Manhattan. Tired of the conflicts with the Scalabrinian leadership, she cut all ties between them and MSC in 1892.

During the early 1890s, Cabrini established schools for Italian communities in Manhattan, the Bronx, Newark, New Jersey, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Cabrini returned to Louisiana in 1895 and established missions in Metairie, Harvey Canal and Kenner. The MSC sisters traveling by mule through rural towns and villages to minister to Catholics. They would visit local hospitals and act as interpreters for Italian patients who could not speak English.

While in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1896, Cabrini made these comments about how she coped with all of her work.“Prayer and interior silence are great necessities for the person who is occupied with a thousand concerns: speaking, listening, hearing, giving of herself even to many good things...Prayer and silence bring her to that mystical rest.&quot;

=== Later years ===

Cabrini arrived in Chicago in 1899 to work with the large Italian population in that city. Her next stop in 1902 was in Denver, Colorado, followed by a trip to Seattle, Washington, in 1903.

In 1907, Cabrini stopped in Philadelphia to have dinner with Mother Katherine Drexel, who had established numerous Catholic missions and schools through the United States for African-Americans and Native Americans. Cabrini had wanted to personally thank Drexel for her helping an MSC sister in Philadelphia. In a very amiable conversation, Drexel told Cabrini that the Vatican bureaucracy was stymieing her religious order on a legal matter. Believing in direct action, Cabrini told her to personally go to Rome and stay there until the Vatican resolved the problem. Drexel took her advice and succeeded in her mission.

Cabrini was naturalized as a United States citizen in 1909. She applied for citizenship to assure the legal foundation of the MSC order after her death and to demonstrate solidarity with the Americans that she served.

Cabrini in 1911 opened a second Columbus Hospital in the Italian neighborhood in Lincoln Park in Chicago. However, some neighbors were unhappy with the new hospital, fearing that it would lower property values. During its construction in the winter, a vandal cut the water mains, flooding the construction site. When the Columbus Extension Hospital was being built on the Near West Side, an arson attack on its grounds was thwarted.

In early second quarter 1912, Cabrini and several MSC sisters were visiting Naples, Italy. To return to the United States, they booked passage on the maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic to New York. However, after hearing about problems with the Columbus Extension Hospital in Chicago, Cabrini switched their bookings to an earlier voyage on a different ship. The Titanic sunk in the North Atlantic with a massive loss of life on April 15 of that year. During her lifetime, Cabrini made 24 transatlantic crossings.

On one of her final trips, Cabrini visited Southern California in 1916. She constructed a chapel above the San Fernando Valley on Mount Raphael to protect the residents from wildfires. It was relocated in 1970 to Burbank, California, to become part of the Mother Cabrini Shrine.

==Death and legacy==

In failing health, Cabrini traveled to Chicago in 1917 to be cared for by the MSC sisters there. On December 21, 1917, she was wrapping sweets she bought as Christmas gifts for children at the Italian school. However, the next day she suddenly got sick and was rushed to Columbus Hospital. She died there on December 22 from chronic endocarditis at age 67.

Cabrini&#x27;s body lay in state at Columbus Hospital until December 26, when it was transported from Chicago to New York City by train. Arriving two days later, she lay in state in New York until December 31. on January 1, 1918, Cabrini was interred at a plot at the Saint Cabrini Home in West Park. Her remains were permanently exhumed in 1933 with the start of the campaign for her sainthood.

During her lifetime, Cabrini founded 67 orphanages, schools and hospitals throughout the United States, Latin America, the Caribbean region, and in Europe. In 1926, the MSC achieved Cabrini&#x27;s original goal of sending missionaries to China.

==Veneration==

In 1921, Peter Smith was born in Columbus Hospital in New York. He was blinded when a nurse accidentally administered a 50% silver nitrate solution into his eyes. The doctors said that Smith&#x27;s corneas were destroyed and that he was permanently blind. The mother superior of the hospital later touched a relic of Cabrini to his eyes and pinned a medal of cabrini to his gown. The nurse who gave Smith the eyedrops prayed for the intercession of Cabrini to help him. When the doctors examined Smith 72 hours later, his eyes were normal. Smith then survived a severe bout of pneumonia. The Vatican cited this case as a miracle in 1938.

Sister Delphina Grazioli, an MSC sister, was dying after four surgical procedures in Seattle from 1925 to 1929. She saw a vision of Cabrini and then made a miraculous recovery. The Vatican accepted this also in 1938 as a miracle from Cabrini.

In 1933, the MSC exhumed Cabrini&#x27;s body and divided it as part of her canonization process. They sent her head to the MSC motherhouse in Rome for display in its chapel. Her heart went to Codogno and her arm bone to the National Shrine of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini in Chicago. The sisters sent the rest of her remains to the St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Shrine in New York City.

Citing the Smith and Grazioli cures, Pope Pius XI beatified Cabrini on November 13, 1938. Smith, now a priest, attended the ceremony. Pope Pius XII canonized Cabrini on July 7, 1946. After Cabrini was canonized, an estimated 120,000 people attended a mass of thanksgiving at Soldier Field in Chicago.

In 1950, Pius XII named Cabrini as the patron saint of immigrants, recognizing her efforts worldwide to build schools, orphanages and hospitals.Pope Francis has stated that Cabrini&#x27;s charitable works in Argentina inspired him to become a priest.

In the Roman Martyrology, Cabrini&#x27;s feast day is December 22, the anniversary of her death. This is the day ordinarily chosen as a saint&#x27;s feast day. Following the reforms in Pope John XXIII&#x27;s Code of Rubrics in 1960, the United States has celebrated Cabrini&#x27;s feast day on November 13, her beatification day. This change was made to avoid conflicting with the greater ferias of Advent.

==Shrines==

===National Shrine of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini===
The National Shrine of Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini is located in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. When the shrine was founded in 1955, it was located within the Columbus Hospital complex in Chicago. Cabrini had founded the hospital in 1905, lived and worked there, and died there in 1917. After Cabrini&#x27;s canonization in 1946, the archdiocese decided that it needed a shrine in her honor. When the hospital was demolished for a high rise development in 2002, the shrine closed for ten years. It was relocated next to the new development and renovated.

Cardinal Francis George redicated the National Shrine in 2012. Today, it contains gold mosaics, Carrara marble, frescoes, and Florentine stained glass. It also preserves the hospital room from the Columbus Hospital where Cabrini died. Visitors use the shrine today for worship, spiritual care, and pilgrimage.

===Mother Cabrini Shrine===
The Mother Cabrini Shrine is located on Lookout Mountain in Golden, Colorado. Cabrini purchased the property in 1910 to serve as a summer camp for the girls from her Queen of Heaven Orphanage in Denver. She built the Stone House at the camp in 1914 to serve as the girls dormitory.

After Cabrini&#x27;s canonization in 1946, the MSC converted the summer camp into the Mother Cabrini Shrine. It contains a footpath partway up Lookout Mountain, marked with the Stations of the Cross, that ends at a statue of Jesus. The shrine campus includes a convent, visitor accommodations, a chapel and an exhibit of Cabrini artifacts. The statues and stained-glass windows in the chapel originated from the former Villa Cabrini Academy in Burbank, California.

===St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Shrine===
The St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Shrine is located in the Hudson Heights neighborhood of New York City. Cabrini purchased the property in 1899 to establish a school for the girls of wealthy families. In 1930, the MSC established the Mother Cabrini High School on the property. They moved the Cabrini remains from the MSC property in West Park, New York, in 1938 to a glass-enclosed coffin under the altar of the high school chapel.

Cabrini&#x27;s canonization in 1946 brought a huge influx of visitors to the school chapel. To accommodate them, the sisters in 1960 moved her remains out of the high school to a separate shrine building on the campus. They now reside in a large bronze-and-glass reliquary casket in the shrine&#x27;s altar. Cabrini&#x27;s body is covered with her religious habit and a sculpted face mask and hands for viewing.

===Other shrines===

<text>The kingpin (also king-pin, king pin and k pin) is the main in the steering mechanism of a car or other vehicle.

The term is also used to refer to part of a fifth wheel coupling apparatus for a semi and its trailer or other load.

==History==
Originally, with the &#x27;turntable&#x27; steering of horse-drawn wagons, this was a single pin on which the moveable axle was pivoted beneath the wagon&#x27;s frame. This located the axle from side to side, but the weight of the wagon was carried on a circular wooden ring turntable surrounding this. Similar centre pivot steering was used by steam traction engines, the kingpin being mounted on the &#x27;perch bracket&#x27; beneath the boiler. Some early cars also used centre pivot steering, although it became apparent that it was unsuitable for their increasing speeds.

Ackermann steering separates the steering movement into two pivots, one near the hub of each front wheel. The beam axle between them remains fixed relative to the chassis, linked by the suspension. Ackermann steering has the two advantages that it reduces tyre scrub, the need to drag tyres sideways across their tread when turning the steering, and also it reduced bump steer, suspension and road bumps tending to upset the steering direction. The kingpins were now fixed to the axle ends and the hub carriers pivoted upon them. Most commonly the centre of the kingpin was fixed in the axle and the hub carrier was forked to fit over this, but some vehicles, including the Ford Model T illustrated, used a forked axle and a kingpin fixed into a single piece carrier. Kingpins were always clamped in the centre and the swivel bearings at the ends, to increase the lever arm and so reduce the bearing load.

Independent front suspension developed through the 1930s, for high-performance cars at least, often using double wishbone suspension. This performance also encouraged the reduction of unsprung weight. Rather than using separate pivots for both the up-and-down motion of the suspension and the steering swivel, the use of a spherical ball joint that could move in two degrees of freedom allowed the same joint to carry out both functions. The hub carrier extended vertically to span the ends of both wishbones, with a ball joint at each end. In the 1950s and 1960s, such independent suspension became commonplace through light cars in all price ranges. Although the kingpin was no longer an identifiable physical component, suspension geometry was still designed in terms of a virtual kingpin along a line between the ball joint centres.
Although they are largely obsolete, kingpin suspensions have the advantage of being able to carry much heavier weights, which is why they are still featured on some heavy trucks. Dana produced the kingpin version of the D60 axle until 1991. (The functionally analogous, similar looking and very robust joint between the chassis and boom on a backhoe is however referred to as a king post.)

The nipple at the front of a semi-trailer to connect to a fifth wheel coupling on a tractor unit is also known as a kingpin, which usage is analogous to the original horse-drawn wagon and traction engine steering use.

==Kingpin inclination==

While no current-era automobile front suspension incorporates a physical kingpin, the axis defined by the steering knuckle pivot points acts as a &quot;virtual kingpin&quot; about which the wheel turns. This virtual kingpin is inclined toward the centerline of the vehicle at an angle called the kingpin angle. Virtual or physical, the kingpin angle may also be referred to by its initialism &quot;KPA&quot;, &quot;kingpin inclination&quot; (&quot;KPI&quot;), or &quot;steering axis inclination&quot; (&quot;SAI&quot;), and remains a fundamental vehicle design parameter. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the vertical, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle, and it is not adjustable, changing only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent.

The kingpin angle has an important effect on steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position because the straight ahead position is where the suspended body of the vehicle is at its lowest point. Thus, the weight of the vehicle tends to rotate the wheel about the kingpin back to this position. The kingpin inclination also contributes to the scrub radius of the steered wheel, the distance between the centre of the tyre contact patch and where the kingpin axis intersects the ground. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero.

==As a biological metaphor==
Zoologist Nicholas Humphrey introduced his 1976 paper &quot;The Social Functions of Intellect&quot; with the following anecdote:

Henry Ford, it is said, commissioned a survey of the car
scrap-yards of America to find out if there were parts of the
Model T Ford which never failed. His inspectors came back
with reports of almost every kind of failure: axles, brakes,
pistons – all were liable to go wrong. But they drew attention
to one notable exception, the kingpins of the scrapped cars
invariably had years of life left in them. With ruthless logic
Ford concluded that the kingpins on the Model T were too
good for their job and ordered that in future they should be
made to an inferior specification.

Humphrey used the metaphor to introduce the idea of the efficiency of resource allocation by natural selection (&quot;Nature is surely at least as careful an economist as Henry Ford&quot;). The metaphor has been cited by several prominent science writers including Richard Dawkins, John Barrow, and Jared Diamond. Biologists Robert A. Laird and Thomas N. Sherratt have questioned both the truth of the story and the utility of the metaphor, pointing out that evolution of multicomponent systems need not result in identical component failure rates.

<doc id="263745" wikidata="Q130157093" url="?curid=263745" title="Rack and pinion">
<text>A rack and pinion is a type of linear actuator that comprises a circular gear (the &quot;pinion&quot;) engaging a linear gear (the &quot;rack&quot;). Together, they convert between rotational motion and linear motion: rotating the pinion causes the rack to be driven in a line. Conversely, moving the rack linearly will cause the pinion to rotate. 

The rack and pinion mechanism is used in rack railways, where the pinion mounted on a locomotive or a railroad car engages a rack usually placed between the rails, and helps to move the train up a steep gradient. It is also used in arbor presses and drill presses, where the pinion is connected to a lever and displaces a vertical rack (the ram). In pipelines and other industrial piping systems, a rack displaced by a linar actuator turns a pinion to open or close a valve. Stairlifts, lock gates, electric gates, and the mechanical steering mechanism of cars are other notable applications. 

The term &quot;rack and pinion&quot; may be used also when the rack is not straight but arcuate (bent), namely just a section of a large gear.

A single pinion can simultaneously drive two racks, parallel but opposite; which will always be displaced by the same distance, only in opposite directions. Conversely, by applying opposite forces to the two racks one can obtain pure torque on the pinion, without any force component. This double rack and pinion mechanism can be used, for example, with a pair of pneumatic actuators to operate a valve with minimum stress.

== Applications gallery ==

==History==

The time and place of the invention of the rack-and-pinion mechanism are unknown, but it presumably was not long after the invention of gears. The south-pointing chariot from China and the Antikythera mechanism are evidence of these being well-known already a couple of centuries BC.

In 1598, firearms designer Zhao Shizhen developed the Xuanyuan arquebus (軒轅銃), featuring a rack-and-pinion matchlock mechanism derived from an Ottoman Turkish matchlock design. The &quot;Wu Pei Chih&quot; (1621) later described Ottoman Turkish muskets that used a rack-and-pinion mechanism.

The use of a variable rack (still using a normal pinion) was invented by Arthur Ernest Bishop in the 1970s, so as to improve vehicle response and steering &quot;feel&quot;, especially at high speeds. He also created a low cost press forging process to manufacture the racks, eliminating the need to machine the gear teeth.

== Comparison with Worm gear ==

A rack and pinion has roughly the same purpose as a worm gear with a rack replacing the gear, in that both convert torque to linear force. However the rack and pinion generally provides higher linear speed — since a full turn of the pinion displaces the rack by an amount equal to the pinion&#x27;s pitch circle whereas a full rotation of the worm screw only displaces the rack by one tooth width. By the same token, a rack and pinion mechanism yields a smaller linear force than a worm gear, for the same input torque. Also, a rack and pinion pair can be used in the opposite way, to turn linear force into torque; whereas a worm drive can be used in only one way.

== Geometry ==
The teeth of a rack and pinion pair may be either straight (parallel to the rotation axis, as in a spur gear) or helical. On the pinion, the profile of the working tooth surfaces is usually an arc of involute, as in most gears. On the rack, on the other hand, the matching working surfaces are flat. One may interpret them as involute tooth faces for a gear with infinite radius. In both parts the teeth are typically formed with a gear cutter (a hob).

<doc id="263746" wikidata="Q470867" url="?curid=263746" title="Bell Beaker culture">
<text>The Bell Beaker culture, also known as the Bell Beaker complex or Bell Beaker phenomenon, is an archaeological culture named after the inverted-bell beaker drinking vessel used at the beginning of the European Bronze Age, arising from around 2800 BC. The term&#x27;s English translation &quot;Bell Beaker&quot; was introduced by John Abercromby in 1904.

Bell Beaker culture lasted in Britain from BC, with the appearance of single burial graves, until as late as 1800 BC, but in continental Europe only until 2300 BC, when it was succeeded by the Únětice culture. The culture was widely dispersed throughout Western Europe, being present in many regions of Iberia and stretching eastward to the Danubian plains, and northward to the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, and was also present in the islands of Sardinia and Sicily and some coastal areas in north-western Africa. The Bell Beaker phenomenon shows substantial regional variation, and a study from 2018 found that it was associated with genetically diverse populations.

In its early phase, the Bell Beaker culture can be seen as the western contemporary of the Corded Ware culture of Central Europe. From about 2400 BC the Beaker folk culture expanded eastwards, into the Corded Ware horizon. In parts of Central and Eastern Europe, as far east as Poland, a sequence occurs from Corded Ware to Bell Beaker. This period marks a period of cultural contact in Atlantic and Western Europe following a prolonged period of relative isolation during the Neolithic.

In its mature phase, the Bell Beaker culture is understood as not only a collection of characteristic artefact types, but a complex cultural phenomenon involving metalwork in copper, arsenical bronze and gold, long-distance exchange networks, archery, specific types of ornamentation, and (presumably) shared ideological, cultural and religious ideas, as well as social stratification and the emergence of regional elites. A wide range of regional diversity persists within the widespread late Beaker culture, particularly in local burial styles (including incidences of cremation rather than burial), housing styles, economic profile, and local ceramic wares (). Nonetheless, according to Lemercier (2018) the mature phase of the Beaker culture represents &quot;the appearance of a kind of Bell Beaker civilization of continental scale&quot;.

==Origins and expansion==

===Origins===
The Bell Beaker artefacts (at least in their early phase) are not distributed across a contiguous area, as is usual for archaeological cultures, but are found in insular concentrations scattered across Europe. Their presence is not associated with a characteristic type of architecture or of burial customs. However, the Bell Beaker culture does appear to coalesce into a coherent archaeological culture in its later phase.

The origin of the &quot;Bell Beaker&quot; artefacts has been traced to the early 3rd millennium, with early examples of the &quot;maritime&quot; Bell Beaker design having been found at the Tagus estuary in Portugal, radiocarbon dated to century BC. The inspiration for the Maritime Bell Beaker is argued to have been the small and earlier &quot;Copoz&quot; beakers that have impressed decoration and which are found widely around the Tagus estuary in Portugal. Turek sees late Neolithic precursors in northern Africa, arguing the Maritime style emerged as a result of seaborne contacts between Iberia and Morocco in the first half of the third millennium BC.

More recent analyses of the &quot;Beaker phenomenon&quot;, published since the 2000s, have persisted in describing the origin of the &quot;Beaker phenomenon&quot; as arising from a synthesis of elements, representing &quot;an idea and style uniting different regions with different cultural traditions and background.&quot;

===Expansion and Corded Ware contacts===
The initial moves from the Tagus estuary were maritime. A southern move led to the Mediterranean where &#x27;enclaves&#x27; were established in south-western Spain and southern France around the Golfe du Lion and into the Po Valley in Italy, probably via ancient western Alpine trade routes used to distribute jadeite axes. A northern move incorporated the southern coast of Armorica. The enclave established in southern Brittany was linked closely to the riverine and landward route, via the Loire, and across the Gâtinais Valley to the Seine Valley, and thence to the lower Rhine. This was a long-established route reflected in early stone axe distributions, and via this network, Maritime Bell Beakers first reached the Lower Rhine in  BC.

Another expansion brought Bell Beaker to Csepel Island in Hungary by about 2500 BC. In the Carpathian Basin, the Bell Beaker culture came in contact with communities such as the Vučedol culture (–2200 BC), which had evolved partly from the Yamnaya culture (c. 3300–2600 BC). In contrast to the early Bell Beaker preference for the dagger and bow, the favourite weapon in the Carpathian Basin during the first half of the third millennium was the shaft-hole axe. Here, Bell Beaker people assimilated local pottery forms such as the polypod cup. These &quot;common ware&quot; types of pottery then spread in association with the classic bell beaker.

The Rhine was on the western edge of the vast Corded Ware zone (), forming a contact zone with the Bell Beaker culture. From there, the Bell Beaker culture spread further into Eastern Europe, replacing the Corded Ware culture up to the Vistula (Poland).

A review in 2014 revealed that single burial, communal burial, and reuse of Neolithic burial sites are found throughout the Bell Beaker zone. This overturns a previous conviction that single burial was unknown in the early or southern Bell Beaker zone, and so must have been adopted from Corded Ware in the contact zone of the Lower Rhine, and transmitted westwards along the exchange networks from the Rhine to the Loire, and northwards across the English Channel to Britain.

The earliest copper production in Ireland, identified at Ross Island in the period 2400–2200 BC, was associated with early Beaker pottery. Here, the local sulpharsenide ores were smelted to produce the first copper axes used in Britain and Ireland. The same technologies were used in the Tagus region and in the west and south of France. The evidence is sufficient to support the suggestion that the initial spread of Maritime Bell Beakers along the Atlantic and into the Mediterranean, using sea routes that had long been in operation, was directly associated with the quest for copper and other rare raw materials.

===Migration vs. acculturation===

While &quot;Bell Beaker&quot; (&quot;Glockenbecher&quot;) was introduced as a term for the artefact type at the beginning of the 20th century,
recognition of an archaeological &quot;Bell Beaker culture&quot; has long been controversial. Its spread has been one of the central questions of the migrationism vs. diffusionism debate in 20th-century archaeology, variously described as due to migration, possibly of small groups of warriors, craftsmen or traders, or due to the diffusion of ideas and object exchange.

====Migration====
Given the unusual form and fabric of Beaker pottery, and its abrupt appearance in the archaeological record, along with a characteristic group of other artefacts, known as the Bell Beaker &quot;package&quot;, the explanation for the Beaker culture until the last decades of the 20th century was to interpret it as the migration of one group of people across Europe.

Gordon Childe interpreted the presence of its characteristic artefact as the intrusion of &quot;missionaries&quot; expanding from Iberia along the Atlantic coast, spreading knowledge of copper metallurgy. Stephen Shennan interpreted the artefacts as belonging to a mobile cultural elite imposing itself over the indigenous substrate populations. Similarly, Sangmeister (1972) interpreted the &quot;Beaker folk&quot; (&quot;Glockenbecherleute&quot;) as small groups of highly mobile traders and artisans. Christian Strahm (1995) used the term &quot;Bell Beaker phenomenon&quot; (&quot;Glockenbecher-Phänomen&quot;) as a compromise in order to avoid the term &quot;culture&quot;.

Heyd (1998) concluded that the Bell Beaker culture was intrusive to southern Germany, and existed contemporarily with the local Corded Ware culture.

The burial ritual which typified Bell Beaker sites appears to be intrusive to Western Europe, from Central Europe. Individual inhumations, often under tumuli with the inclusion of weapons contrast markedly to the preceding Neolithic traditions of often collective, weaponless burials in Atlantic/Western Europe. Such an arrangement is rather derivative of Corded Ware traditions.

====Cultural diffusion====
British and American archaeology since the 1960s have been sceptical about prehistoric migration in general, so the idea of &quot;Bell Beaker Folk&quot; lost ground. A theory of cultural contact de-emphasizing population movement was presented by Colin Burgess and Stephen Shennan in the mid-1970s.

Under the &quot;pots, not people&quot; theory, the Beaker culture was seen as a &#x27;package&#x27; of knowledge (including religious beliefs, as well as methods of copper, bronze, and gold working) and artefacts (including copper daggers, v-perforated buttons, and stone wrist-guards) adopted and adapted by the indigenous peoples of Europe to varying degrees. This new knowledge may have come about by any combination of population movements and cultural contact. An example might be as part of a prestige cult related to the production and consumption of beer, or trading links such as those demonstrated by finds made along the seaways of Atlantic Europe. Palynological studies including analysis of pollen, associated with the spread of beakers, certainly suggests increased growing of barley, which may be associated with beer brewing. Noting the distribution of Beakers was highest in areas of transport routes, including fording sites, river valleys and mountain passes, Beaker &#x27;folk&#x27; were suggested to be originally bronze traders, who subsequently settled within local Neolithic or early Chalcolithic cultures, creating local styles. Close analysis of the bronze tools associated with beaker use suggests an early Iberian source for the copper, followed subsequently by Central European and Bohemian ores.

AOO and AOC Beakers appear to have evolved continually from a pre-Beaker period in the lower Rhine and North Sea regions, at least for Northern and Central Europe.

====Renewed emphasis on migration====
Investigations in the Mediterranean and France recently moved the discussion to re-emphasise the importance of migration to the Bell Beaker story. Instead of being pictured as a fashion or a simple diffusion of objects and their use, the investigation of over 300 sites showed that human groups actually moved in a process that involved explorations, contacts, settlement, diffusion, and acculturation/assimilation.

Some elements show the influence from the north and east, and other elements reveal the south-east of France to be an important crossroad on an important route of communication and exchange spreading north. A distinctive &#x27;barbed wire&#x27; pottery decoration is thought to have migrated through central Italy first. The pattern of movements was diverse and complicated, along the Atlantic coast and the northern Mediterranean coast, and sometimes also far inland. The prominent central role of Portugal in the region and the quality of the pottery all across Europe are forwarded as arguments for a new interpretation that denies an ideological dimension.

Genetic findings also lend support to the migratory hypothesis. An strontium isotope analysis of 86 people from Bell Beaker graves in Bavaria, suggests that 18–25% of all graves were occupied by people who came from a considerable distance outside the area. This was true of children and adults, indicative of some significant migration wave. Given the similarities with readings from people living on loess soils, the general direction of the local movement is from the northeast to the southwest.

Archaeogenetics studies of the 2010s have been able to resolve the &quot;migrationist vs. diffusionist&quot; question to some extent. The study by Olalde et al. (2018) found only &quot;limited genetic affinity&quot; between individuals associated with the Beaker complex in Iberia and in Central Europe, suggesting that migration played a limited role in its early spread. However, the same study found that the further dissemination of the mature Beaker complex was very strongly linked to migration. This is true especially for Britain, where the spread of the Beaker culture introduced high levels of steppe-related ancestry, resulting in a near-complete transformation of the local gene pool within a few centuries, to the point of replacement of about 90% of the local Neolithic-derived lineages.

==Bell Beaker artifacts==

The two main international bell beaker styles are: the All Over Ornamented (AOO), patterned all over with impressions, of which a subset is the All Over Corded (AOC), patterned with cord-impressions; and the Maritime type, decorated with bands filled with impressions made with a comb or cord. Later, other characteristic regional styles developed.

The beakers are suggested to have been designed for the consumption of alcohol, and the introduction of the substance to Europe may have fuelled the beakers&#x27; spread. Beer and mead content have been identified from certain examples. However, not all Beakers were drinking cups. Some were used as reduction pots to smelt copper ores, others have some organic residues associated with food, and still others were employed as funerary urns. They were used as status display amongst disparate elites.

==Postulated linguistic connections==

As the Beaker culture left no written records, all theories regarding the language or languages they spoke remain conjectural. It has been suggested as a candidate for an early Indo-European culture, or as the origin of the Vasconic substrate.

James Mallory (2013) notes that the Beaker culture was associated with a hypothetical cluster of Indo-European dialects termed &quot;North-West Indo-European&quot;, a cluster which includes the (predecessors of) Celtic, Italic, Germanic and Balto-Slavic branches. Earlier theories suggested a link to the hypothesised Italo-Celtic, or Proto-Celtic languages.

According to Csaba Barnabas (2019), genetic research and linguistics do not protect the hypothesis of Celtic languages, because if they had spread at that time they would have the same difference we can find between Sanskrit and Latin. He relates Celtic languages to the La Tène culture and proposes that Basque is the only life after the spread of the culture of the Bell Beakers.

==Physical anthropology==
Historical craniometric studies found that the Beaker people appeared to be of a different physical type than those earlier populations in the same geographic areas. They were described as tall, heavy boned and brachycephalic. The early studies on the Beakers which were based on the analysis of their skeletal remains, were craniometric. This apparent evidence of migration was in line with archaeological discoveries linking Beaker culture to new farming techniques, mortuary practices, copper-working skills, and other cultural innovations. However, such evidence from skeletal remains was brushed aside as a new movement developed in archaeology from the 1960s, which stressed cultural continuity. Anti-migrationist authors either paid little attention to skeletal evidence or argued that differences could be explained by environmental and cultural influences. Margaret Cox and Simon Mays sum up the position: &quot;Although it can hardly be said that craniometric data provide an unequivocal answer to the problem of the Beaker folk, the balance of the evidence would at present seem to favour a migration hypothesis.&quot;

Non-metrical research concerning the Beaker people in Britain also cautiously pointed in the direction of migration. Subsequent studies, such as one concerning the Carpathian Basin, and a non-metrical analysis of skeletons in central-southern Germany, have also identified marked typological differences with the pre-Beaker inhabitants.

Jocelyne Desideri examined the teeth in skeletons from Bell Beaker sites in Northern Spain, Southern France, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Examining dental characteristics that have been independently shown to correlate with genetic relatedness, she found that only in Northern Spain and the Czech Republic were there demonstrable links between immediately previous populations and Bell Beaker populations. Elsewhere there was a discontinuity.

==Genetics==
=== Iberia ===

The earliest Bell Beaker samples in Iberia lacked Steppe ancestry, but between ~2500 and 2000 BC there was a replacement of 40% of Iberia&#x27;s ancestry and nearly 100% of its Y-chromosomes by people with Steppe ancestry. Y-chromosome lineages common in Copper Age Iberia (I2, G2, H) were nearly completely replaced by one lineage, R1b-M269. The most plausible source population for this genetic influx was found to be Germany Bell Beaker. The earliest samples with Steppe ancestry were located in northern Spain and were modelled as deriving 60.2% of their ancestry from Germany Bell Beaker and 39.8% from the Iberian Copper Age, whilst Iberian Bronze Age samples from c. 2000 BC were modelled as 39.6% Germany Bell Beaker and 60.4% Iberia Copper Age. Some Iberian samples had up to 100% Central European Bell Beaker ancestry. A higher percentage of the genetic influx was due to men than women. These results confirm the earlier findings of Patterson et al. (2012) who detected &quot;a signal of gene flow from populations related to present-day northern Europeans into Spain around 2000 BC&quot;, which was hypothesised to be a &quot;genetic signal of the Bell Beaker culture&quot;.

Villalba-Mouco et al. (2021) analysed genome-wide data from 136 southern Iberian individuals dating from the Late Neolithic (3300 cal BCE) to the Late Bronze Age (1200/1000 cal BCE). They found that Bronze Age populations, including those from the El Argar culture were &quot;shifted toward populations with steppe-related ancestry from central Europe&quot; compared to preceding Copper Age groups. After 2100 cal BCE, all individuals from all sites carried steppe-related ancestry, in line with R1b-P312 [R1b-M269] becoming the predominant Y-chromosomal lineage. The major additional ancestry source resembled central European Bell Beaker groups, which first contributed ancestry to northern Iberia, followed by a southward spread. According to the authors, &quot;R1b-Z195, the most common Y lineage in BA Iberia, ultimately derives from a common ancestor R1b-P312 in central Europe.&quot; The authors propose that the El Argar culture &quot;likely formed from a mixture of new groups arriving from north-central Iberia, which already carried central European steppe-related ancestry (and the predominant Y-chromosome lineage) and local southeastern Iberian CA groups that differed from other regions in Iberian in that they carried excess Iran_N-like ancestry similar to eastern and/or central Mediterranean groups.&quot;

=== Central and Northern Europe ===
Lee et al. (2012) detected R1b two male skeletons from a German Bell Beaker site dated to 2600–2500 BC at Kromsdorf, one of which tested positive for M269 but negative for its U106 subclade (note that the P312 subclade was not tested for), while for the other skeleton the M269 test was unclear. A study published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2018 confirmed a massive population turnover in western Europe associated with the Bell Beaker culture. In Britain the spread of the Bell Beaker culture introduced high levels of Steppe-related ancestry and was associated with a replacement of ~90% of the gene pool within a few hundred years. British Beaker-associated individuals showed strong similarities to central European Beaker-associated individuals in their genetic profile. Both men and women with Steppe ancestry participated in the turnover in Neolithic Britain, as evidenced by the rise of the paternal haplogroup R1b and maternal haplogroups I, R1a and U4. The paternal haplogroup R1b was completely absent in Neolithic individuals, but represented more than 90% of the Y-chromosomes during Copper and Bronze Age Britain. The study also found that the Bell Beaker arrivals in Neolithic Britain had significantly higher genetic variants associated with light skin and eye pigmentation than the local population, but low frequencies of the SNP associated with lactase persistence in modern Europeans.

Two studies published in 2015 (Haak et al. 2015, Mathieson et al. 2015) found that Bell Beaker individuals from Germany and the Czech Republic had high proportions of Steppe-related ancestry, showing that they derived from mixtures of populations from the Steppe (such as Corded Ware and Yamnaya) and the preceding Neolithic farmers of Europe. The Y-chromosome composition of Beaker-associated males was dominated by R1b-M269, a lineage associated with the arrival of Steppe migrants in central Europe after 3000 BC. Bell Beaker individuals from Germany analysed by Haak et al. (2015) were found to have less Steppe ancestry than the earlier Corded Ware culture. In a comprehensive study including samples from across Europe, Yediay et al. (2024, preprint) showed conclusively that the steppe ancestry in Bell Beaker populations was derived from the Corded Ware culture, rather than from the Yamnaya culture. Allentoft et al. (2015) found the people of the Bell Beaker culture to be closely genetically related to the Corded Ware culture, the Únětice culture and the Nordic Bronze Age. Among modern populations, Bell Beaker people from Germany, France and Britain were closest genetically to modern British, Dutch, German, Danish and Swedish people.Furtwängler et al. (2020) analysed 96 ancient genomes from Switzerland, Southern Germany, and the Alsace region in France, covering the Middle/Late Neolithic to Early Bronze Age. They confirmed that R1b arrived in the region during the transitory Bell Beaker period (2800-1800 BC), along with Steppe-related ancestry. The vast majority of Bell Beaker R1b samples belonged to the U152 &gt; L2 clade (11 out of 14; the other being P312 or L51).

Allentoft et al. (2024) found that individuals from Denmark dating from the &#x27;Dagger Period&#x27; (c. 2300–1700 BCE) clustered with central and western European Late Neolithic-Bronze Age individuals dominated by males with lineages of R1b-M269/L51, matching the appearance of Bell Beaker material culture in Denmark at this time.

=== Eastern Europe ===
Papac et al. (2021) found that the earliest Bell Beaker individuals from Bohemia in the Czech Republic had a similar genetic composition to Corded Ware individuals. A closer phylogenetic relationship was observed between the Y-chromosome lineages found in early Corded Ware and Bell Beaker than in either late Corded Ware or Yamnaya and Bell Beaker. R1b-L151 was the most common Y-lineage among early Corded Ware males in Bohemia, and was ancestral to R1b-P312, the dominant Y-lineage found in Bell Beaker males.

Engovatova et al. (2024) found a particularly close genetic similarity between a male from the Abashevo culture in the Middle Volga region of Russia and Bell Beaker populations from Germany and the Czech Republic, reflecting the presence of Bell Beaker elements (as well as Únětice-like elements) in the material culture of Abashevo. The authors attribute this to a long-distance migration of groups from central Europe to the Middle Volga region.

=== Italy ===
Olalde et al. (2018) analysed three Bell Beaker-associated individuals (one male and two females) from northern Italy (Parma), dating from 2200 to 1930 BC. Two of the individuals were found to have around 25% Early Bronze Age Steppe-related ancestry whilst one had none. The male belonged to Y-haplogroup R1b1a1a2a1a2 (R1b-M269/P312).

A study by Saupe et al. (2021) found that Bronze Age populations from Northern and Central Italy were characterised by a mix of earlier Chalcolithic ancestry and Steppe-related ancestry. The study found an autosomal affinity of North and Central Italian Bronze Age groups to Late Neolithic Germany, suggesting that Steppe-related ancestry could have arrived through Bell Beaker groups from Central Europe, such as &#x27;Germany Bell Beaker&#x27;. Three out of the four Italian Bronze Age males for which the paternal haplogroup could be determined belonged to haplogroup R1, and two of those were of the R1b-L11 lineage, which was absent in earlier Chalcolithic samples but is common in modern Western Europe and in ancient male Bell-Beaker burials.

Posth et al. (2021) found that Iron Age Etruscans from central Italy could be modelled as deriving 50% of their ancestry from Central European Bell Beakers (represented by Germany Bell Beaker), with around 25-30% steppe ancestry. Two Etruscan samples were modelled as having 80% Germany Bell Beaker ancestry. Overall, the Etruscan samples showed ~75% frequency of the Y-haplogroup R1b, mostly represented by R1b-P312 and its derived R1b-L2 lineage &quot;that diffused across Europe alongside steppe-related ancestry in association with the Bell Beaker complex.&quot; According to the authors, the Etruscans carried &quot;a local genetic profile shared with other neighboring populations such as the Latins from Rome and its environs despite the cultural and linguistic differences between the two neighboring groups.&quot; Antonio et al. (2019) similarly found that 5 out of 6 male Iron Age Latins samples belonged to the R1b-M269 Y-haplogroup, consistent with &quot;the arrival of Steppe ancestry, via migration of Steppe pastoralists or intermediary populations in the preceding Bronze Age.&quot;, and did not find significant genetic differentiation between the Latins and the Etruscans. The Iron Age Latin population showed a clear ancestry shift from the earlier Copper Age, modelled as an introduction of ~30 to 40% steppe ancestry, which was indicative of &quot;large-scale immigration before the Iron Age.&quot;

Yediay et al. (2024, Preprint) found that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Italy was mediated by &quot;Bell Beaker populations of Western Europe&quot;, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages and consistent with the Italo-Celtic linguistic hypothesis. This Bell Beaker-related steppe ancestry was in turn derived from the earlier Corded Ware culture, rather than from the Yamnaya culture.

According to Chintalapatia et al. (2022) a majority of Bronze Age samples from Sardinia lacked steppe-related ancestry, though evidence for steppe-related ancestry was found in a few individuals. This ancestry is estimated to have arrived in Sardinia ~2600 BC.

=== Periphery ===
Yediay et al. (2024, Preprint) identified a small amount of Bell Beaker ancestry in some individuals from Bronze Age Greece, &quot;reflecting a connection with Central Eastern Europe&quot; and &quot;contact with the populations from the Balkan Bronze Age&quot;. Two outlier individuals from Cyprus, dating from c. 1700 BC clustered with Scandinavian Bronze Age individuals and were modelled as deriving their ancestry from the Bell Beaker culture. One of these individuals carried the male haplogroup I1 and displayed a non-local strontium isotope signature compatible with an origin in Scandinavia (particularly Sweden), revealing &quot;an extraordinary journey from Scandinavia to Cyprus&quot;. This may be related to the presence of ring ingots and dress pins from the Central European Únětice culture in Cyprus from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. 

In a 2020 review Fregel et al. identified European Bronze Age ancestry (including Steppe ancestry) in Guanches from the Canary Islands, which could be explained by &quot;the presence of Bell-Beaker pottery in the North African archaeological record&quot; and &quot;the expansion of European Bronze Age populations in North Africa&quot;. Serrano et al. 2023 analysed genome-wide data from 49 Guanche individuals, whose ancestry was modelled as comprising 73.3% Morocco Late Neolithic, 6.9% Morocco Early Neolithic, 13.4% Germany Bell Beaker and 6.4% Mota on average. Germany Bell Beaker ancestry reached 16.2% and 17.9% in samples from Gran Canaria and Lanzarote respectively. Bell Beaker-related haplogroups identified in the Guanches include Y-DNA R1b-M269, mtDNA U5 and mtDNA H4a1. These haplogroups have also been identified in mummies from Ancient Egypt.

==Extent and impact==
Bell Beaker people took advantage of transport by sea and rivers, creating a cultural spread extending from Ireland to the Carpathian Basin and south along the Atlantic coast and along the Rhône valley to Portugal, North Africa, and Sicily, even penetrating northern and central Italy. Its remains have been found in what is now Portugal, Spain, France (excluding the central massif), Ireland and Great Britain, the Low Countries and Germany between the Elbe and Rhine, with an extension along the upper Danube into the Vienna Basin (Austria), Hungary and the Czech Republic, with Mediterranean outposts on Sardinia and Sicily; there is less certain evidence for direct penetration in the east.

Beaker-type vessels remained in use longest in Great Britain and Ireland; late beakers in other areas are classified as early Bronze Age (Barbed Wire Beakers in the Netherlands, Giant Beakers (Riesenbecher)). The new international trade routes opened by the Beaker people became firmly established and the culture was succeeded by a number of Bronze Age cultures, among them the Únětice culture in Central Europe, the Elp culture and Hilversum culture in the Netherlands, the Atlantic Bronze Age in Great Britain, Ireland, and the Atlantic coast of Europe, and by the Nordic Bronze Age, a culture of Scandinavia and northernmost Germany–Poland.

===Iberian Peninsula===

The Bell Beaker phenomenon in the Iberian Peninsula defines the late phase of the local Chalcolithic and even intrudes in the earliest centuries of the Bronze Age. A review of radiocarbon dates for Bell Beaker across Europe found that some of the earliest were found in Portugal, where the range from Zambujal and Cerro de la Virgen (Spain) ran , in contrast to the rather later range for Andalusia ().

At present, no internal chronology for the various Bell Beaker-related styles has been achieved yet for Iberia. Peninsular corded Bell Beakers are usually found in coastal or near coastal regions in three main regions: the western Pyrenees, the lower Ebro and adjacent east coast, and the northwest (Galicia and northern Portugal). A corded-zoned Maritime variety (C/ZM), proposed to be a hybrid between AOC and Maritime Herringbone, was mainly found in burial contexts and expanded westward, especially along the mountain systems of the Meseta.

With some notable exceptions, most Iberian early Bell Beaker &quot;burials&quot; are at or near the coastal regions. As for the settlements and monuments within the Iberian context, Beaker pottery is generally found in association with local Chalcolithic material and appears most of all as an &quot;intrusion&quot; from the third millennium in burial monuments whose origin may go back to the fourth or fifth millennia BC.

Very early dates for Bell Beakers were found in Castelo Velho de Freixo de Numão in Guarda, central Portugal. The site was located on the summit of a spur. A short-lived first occupation of pre-Bell Beaker building phase at  BC revealed the remains of a tower, some pavings, and structures for burning. After a break of one or two centuries, Bell Beaker pottery was introduced in a second building phase that lasted to the Early Bronze Age,  BC. A third building phase followed directly and lasted to  BC, after which the site was covered with layers of stone and clay, apparently deliberately, and abandoned.

The second building phase was dominated by a highly coherent group of pottery within the regional Chalcolithic styles, representing Maritime Bell Beakers of the local (northern Portuguese), &quot;penteada&quot; decoration style in various patterns, using lines of points, incision or impression. Three of them were carbon dated to the first half of the third millennium BC. The site demonstrates a notable absence of more common Bell Beaker pottery styles such as Maritime Herringbone and Maritime Lined varieties found in nearby sites such as Castanheiro do Vento and Crasto de Palheiros. One non-local Bell Beaker sherd, however, belonging to the upper part of a beaker with a curved neck and thin walls, was found at the bedrock base of this second phase. The technique and patterning are classic forms in the context of pure European and Peninsular corded ware. In the Iberian Peninsula, this AOC type was traditionally restricted to half a dozen scattered sites in the western Pyrenees, the lower Ebro, and the Spanish east coast; especially a vessel at Filomena at Villarreal, Castellón (Spain), has parallels with the decoration. In Porto Torrão, at inner Alentejo (southern Portugal), a similar vessel was found having a date ultimately corrected to 2823–2658 BC. All pottery was locally made. The lack or presence of Bell Beaker elements is the basis for the division of Los Millares and Vila Nova cultures into two periods: I and II.

A gold lunula with two gold discs was found in Cabeceiras de Basto, Portugal, dating from the Bell Beaker period.

In 2016 archaeologists discovered a large circular earthwork enclosure in southern Spain near Carmona (Sevilla), dating from the Bell Beaker period, 2600–2200 BC. The complex of concentric rings, known as &#x27;La Loma del Real Tesoro II&#x27; may have been used for holding rituals. Circular earth and timber enclosures are also known from Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands in this period, as well as Stonehenge in England.

===Balearic Islands===
Radiocarbon dating currently indicates a 1,200-year duration for the use of the Beaker pottery on the Balearic Islands, between about 2475 and 1300 BC. Some evidence exists of all-corded pottery in Mallorca, generally considered the most ancient Bell Beaker pottery, possibly indicating an even earlier Beaker settlement at  BC. However, in several regions, this type of pottery persisted long enough to permit other possibilities. Suárez Otero (1997) postulated this corded Beakers entered the Mediterranean by routes both through the Atlantic coast and eastern France. Bell Beaker pottery has been found in Mallorca and Formentera, but has not been observed in Menorca or Ibiza. Collective burials in dolmen structures in Ibiza could be contrasted against the individual burials in Mallorca. In its latest phase (1750–1300 cal BC) the local Beaker context became associated with the distinctive ornamented Boquique pottery demonstrating clear maritime links with the (megalithic) coastal regions of Catalonia, also assessed to be directly related to the late Cogotas complex. In most of the areas of the mainland, Boquique pottery falls into the latter stages of the Bell Beaker complex, as well. Along with other evidence during the earlier Beaker period in the Balearics, , as shown by the local presence of elephant ivory objects together with significant Beaker pottery and other finds, this maritime interaction can be shown to have a long tradition. The abundance of different cultural elements that persisted towards the end of the Bronze Age, show a clear continuity of different regional and intrusive traditions.

The presence of perforated Beaker pottery, traditionally considered to be used for making cheese, at Son Ferrandell-Oleza and at Coval Simó confirms the introduction of production and conservation of dairy. Also, the presence of spindles at sites like Son Ferrandell-Oleza or Es Velar d&#x27;Aprop point to knowledge of making thread and textiles from wool. However, more details on the strategies for tending and slaughtering the domestic animals involved are forthcoming. Being traditionally associated with the introduction of metallurgy, the first traces of copper working in the Balearics were also clearly associated with Bell Beakers.

===Central Europe===

In their large-scale study on radiocarbon dating of the Bell Beakers, J. Müller and S. Willingen established that the Bell Beaker Culture in Central Europe started c. 2500 BC. Two great coexisting and separate Central European cultures – the Corded Ware with its regional groups and the Eastern Group of the Bell Beaker Culture – form the background to the Late Copper Age and Early Bronze Age. The Makó-Kosihy-Čaka culture, indigenous to the Carpathians, may be included as a third component. Their development, diffusion and long-range changes are determined by the great river systems.

The Bell Beaker settlements are still little known, and have proved remarkably difficult for archaeologists to identify. This allows a modern view of them to contradict results of anthropologic research. The late 20th century view was that the Bell Beaker people, far from being the &quot;warlike invaders&quot; as once described by Gordon Childe (1940), added rather than replaced local late Neolithic traditions into a cultural package and as such did not always and evenly abandon all local traditions. More recent extensive DNA evidence, however, suggests a significant replacement of earlier populations. A notable example of a well excavated and documented settlement is Albertfalva in Hungary, dating from 2470–1950 BC.

Bell Beaker domestic ware has no predecessors in Bohemia and Southern Germany, shows no genetic relation to the local Late Copper Age Corded Ware, nor to other cultures in the area, and is considered something completely new. The Bell Beaker domestic ware of Southern Germany is not as closely related to the Corded Ware as would be indicated by their burial rites. Settlements link the Southern German Bell Beaker culture to the seven regional provinces of the Eastern Group, represented by many settlement traces, especially from Moravia and the Hungarian Bell Beaker-Csepel group being the most important. In 2002, one of the largest Bell Beaker cemeteries in Central Europe was discovered at Hoštice za Hanou (Moravia, Czech Republic).

The relationship to the western Bell Beakers groups, and the contemporary cultures of the Carpathian basin to the south east, is much less. Research in northern Poland shifted the north-eastern frontier of this complex to the western parts of the Baltic with the adjacent Northern European plain. Typical Bell Beaker fragments from the site of Ostrikovac-Djura at the Serbian river Morava were presented at the Riva del Garda conference in 1998, some 100 km south-east of the Csepel Beaker sub-group (modern Hungary). Bell Beaker related material has now been uncovered in a line from the Baltic Sea down to the Adriatic and the Ionian Sea, including the modern states comprising Belarus, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Albania, North Macedonia and parts of Greece.

The Bell Beaker culture settlements in southern Germany and in the East-Group show evidence of mixed farming and animal husbandry, and indicators such as millstones and spindle whorls prove the sedentary character of the Bell Beaker people, and the durability of their settlements. Some especially well equipped child-burials seem to indicate sense of predestined social position, indicating a socially complex society. However, analysis of grave furnishing, position within the cemetery, and size and deepness of grave pits did not lead to any strong conclusions on the social divisions.

The Late Copper Age is regarded as a continuous culture system connecting the Upper Rhine valley to the western edge of the Carpathian Basin. Late Copper Age 1 was defined in southern Germany by the connection of the late Cham Culture, Globular Amphora culture, and the older Corded Ware Culture of &quot;beaker group 1&quot; that is also referred to as Horizon A or Step A. Early Bell Beaker Culture intruded into the region at the end of the Late Copper Age 1, around 2600–2550 BC. Middle Bell Beaker corresponds to Late Copper Age 2 and here an east–west Bell Beaker cultural gradient became visible through the difference in the distribution of the groups of beakers with and without handles, cups and bowls, in the three regions Austria–Western Hungary, the Danube catchment area of Southern Germany, and the Upper Rhine/lake Constance/Eastern Switzerland area for all subsequent Bell Beaker periods. This middle Bell Beaker Culture is the main period when almost all the cemeteries in Southern Germany begin. Younger Bell Beaker Culture of Early Bronze Age shows analogies to the Proto-Únětice Culture in Moravia and the Early Nagyrév Culture of the Carpathian Basin.

During the Bell Beaker period, a border ran through southern Germany, which culturally divided a northern from a southern area. The northern area was oriented around the Rhine and the Bell Beaker West Group, while the southern area occupied much of the Danube river system and was mainly settled by the homogeneous Bell Beaker East Group. This latter group overlapped with the Corded Ware Culture and other groups of the Late Neolithic and early Bronze Age. Nevertheless, southern Germany shows some independent developments of itself.

Although a broadly parallel evolution with early, middle, and younger Bell Beaker Culture was detected, the Southern Germany middle Bell Beaker development of metope decorations and stamp and furrow engraving techniques do not appear on beakers in Austria-Western Hungary, and handled beakers are completely absent. It is contemporary to Corded Ware in the vicinity, that has been attested by associated finds of middle Corded Ware (chronologically referred to as &quot;beaker group 2&quot; or Step B) and younger Geiselgasteig Corded Ware beakers (&quot;beaker group 3&quot; or Step C). Bell Beaker Culture in Bavaria used a specific type of copper, which is characterised by combinations of trace elements. This same type of copper was spread over the area of the Bell Beaker East Group.

Previously some archaeologists considered the Bell-beaker people to have lived only within a limited territory of the Carpathian Basin and for a short time, without mixing with the local population. Although there are very few evaluable anthropological finds, the appearance of the characteristic planoccipital (flattened back) Taurid type in the populations of some later cultures (e.g. Kisapostag and Gáta–Wieselburg cultures) suggested a mixture with the local population contradicting such archaeological theories. According to archaeology, the populational groups of the Bell-beakers also took part in the formation of the Gáta-Wieselburg culture on the western fringes of the Carpathian Basin, which could be confirmed with the anthropological Bell Beaker series in Moravia and Germany. In accordance with anthropological evidence, it has been concluded the Bell Beakers intruded in an already established form the southern part of Germany as much as the East Group area.

Around 2300 BC, large circular enclosures were built at Pömmelte and nearby Schönebeck in central Germany. These were important ritual sites which remained in use until BC. The main entrances of the Pömmelte enclosure were oriented towards sunrise and sunset midway between the solstices and equinoxes, indicating that Pömmelte served as a monument for &quot;ceremonies linked to calendrical rites and seasonal feasting&quot;. The Pömmelte and Schönebeck enclosures formed parts of a &#x27;sacral landscape&#x27; with origins in an early 3rd millennium BC sanctuary and elite burial of the Corded Ware culture. The Pömmelte enclosure also has an almost identical diameter and a similar ground plan to Stonehenge in England. According to excavators the two monuments were built by &quot;the same culture&quot; with &quot;the same view of the world&quot;. The largest known Early Bronze Age settlement in central Europe was built next to the Pömmelte enclosure, belonging to the early phase of the Únětice culture. The remains of 130 large timber houses have been found on the site; they were typically 20 metres in length with some up to 30.5 metres in length, and with floor areas ranging from 80m² to 360m². 

A timber henge-like ritual structure has also been excavated at Poysbrunn in Lower Austria.

===Ireland===

Beakers arrived in Ireland  BC and fell out of use  BC. The beaker pottery of Ireland was rarely used as a grave good, but is often found in domestic assemblages from the period. This stands in contrast to the rest of Europe where it is frequently found in both roles. The inhabitants of Ireland used food vessels as a grave good instead. The large, communal passage tombs of the Irish Neolithic were no longer being constructed during the Early Bronze Age (although some, such as Newgrange were re-used). The preferred method of burial seems to have been single graves and cists in the east, or in small wedge tombs in the west. Cremation was also common.

The advent of the Bronze Age Beaker culture in Ireland is accompanied by the destruction of smaller satellite tombs at Knowth and collapses of the great cairn at Newgrange, marking an end to the Neolithic culture of megalithic passage tombs.

Beakers are found in large numbers in Ireland, and the technical innovation of ring-built pottery indicates that the makers were also present. Classification of pottery in Ireland and Britain has distinguished a total of seven intrusive beaker groups originating from the continent and three groups of purely insular character having evolved from them. Five out of seven of the intrusive Beaker groups also appear in Ireland: the European bell group, the All-over cord beakers, the Scottish/North Rhine beakers, the Northern British/Middle Rhine beakers and the Wessex/Middle Rhine beakers. However, many of the features or innovations of Beaker society in Britain never reached Ireland. Instead, quite different customs predominated in the Irish record that were apparently influenced by the traditions of the earlier inhabitants. Some features that are found elsewhere in association to later types of Earlier Bronze Age Beaker pottery, indeed spread to Ireland, however, without being incorporated into the same close and specific association of Irish Beaker context. The Wessex/Middle Rhine gold discs bearing &quot;wheel and cross&quot; motifs that were probably sewn to garments, presumably to indicate status and reminiscent of racquet headed pins found in Eastern Europe, enjoy a general distribution throughout the country, however, never in direct association with beakers.

In 1984, a Beaker period copper dagger blade was recovered from the Sillees River near Ross Lough, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The flat, triangular-shaped copper blade was long, with bevelled edges and a pointed tip, and featured an integral tang that accepted a riveted handle. Flint arrow-heads and copper-blade daggers with handle tangs, found in association with Beaker pottery in many other parts of Europe, have a date later than the initial phase of Beaker People activity in Ireland. Also the typical Beaker wristguards seem to have entered Ireland by cultural diffusion only, after the first intrusions, and unlike English and Continental Beaker burials never made it to the graves. The same lack of typical Beaker association applies to the about thirty found stone battle axes. A gold ornament found in County Down that closely resembles a pair of ear-rings from Ermegeira, Portugal, has a composition that suggests it was imported. Incidental finds suggest links to non-British Beaker territories, like a fragment of a bronze blade in County Londonderry that has been likened to the &quot;palmella&quot; points of Iberia, even though the relative scarcity of beakers, and Beaker-compatible material of any kind, in the &quot;south-west&quot; are regarded as an obstacle to any colonisation directly from Iberia, or even from France. Their greater concentration in the northern part of the country, which traditionally is regarded as the part of Ireland least blessed with sources of copper, has led many authorities to question the role of Beaker People in the introduction of metallurgy to Ireland. However, indications of their use of stream sediment copper, low in traces of lead and arsenic, and Beaker finds connected to mining and metalworking at Ross Island, County Kerry, provide an escape to such doubts.

The featured &quot;food vessels&quot; and cinerary urns (encrusted, collared and cordoned) of the Irish Earlier Bronze Age have strong roots in the western European Beaker tradition. Recently, the concept of these food vessels was discarded and replaced by a concept of two different traditions that rely on typology: the bowl tradition and the vase tradition, the bowl tradition being the oldest as it has been found inserted in existing Neolithic (pre-beaker) tombs, both court tombs and passage tombs. The bowl tradition occurs over the whole country except the south-west and feature a majority of pit graves, both in flat cemeteries and mounds, and a high incidence of uncremated skeletons, often in crouched position. The vase tradition has a general distribution and feature almost exclusively cremation. The flexed skeleton of a man 1.88 meters tall in a cist in a slightly oval round cairn with &quot;food vessel&quot; at Cornaclery, County Londonderry, was described in the 1942 excavation report as &quot;typifying the race of Beaker Folk&quot;, although the differences between Irish finds and e.g. the British combination of &quot;round barrows with crouched, unburnt burials&quot; make it difficult to establishes the exact nature of the Beaker People&#x27;s colonization of Ireland.

In general, the &quot;early&quot; Irish Beaker intrusions do not attest the overall &quot;Beaker package&quot; of innovations that, once fully developed, swept Europe elsewhere, leaving Ireland behind. The Irish Beaker period is characterised by the earliness of Beaker intrusions, by isolation and by influences and surviving traditions of autochthons.

Beaker culture introduces the practice of burial in single graves, suggesting an Earlier Bronze Age social organisation of family groups. Towards the Later Bronze Age the sites move to potentially fortifiable hilltops, suggesting a more &quot;clan&quot;-type structure. Although the typical Bell Beaker practice of crouched burial has been observed, cremation was readily adopted in accordance with the previous tradition of the autochthons. In a tumulus the find of the extended skeleton of a woman accompanied by the remains of a red deer and a small seven-year-old stallion is noteworthy, including the hint to a Diana-like religion. A few burials seem to indicate social status, though in other contexts an emphasis to special skills is more likely.

One of the most important sites in Ireland during the Beaker period is Ross Island. A series of copper mines from here are the earliest known in Ireland, starting from  BC (O&#x27;Brien 2004). A comparison of chemical traces and lead isotope analysis from these mines with copper artefacts strongly suggests that Ross Island was the sole source of copper in Ireland between the dates 2500–2200 BC. In addition, two thirds of copper artefacts from Britain also display the same chemical and isotopic signature, strongly suggesting that Irish copper was a major export to Britain. Traces of Ross Island copper can be found even further afield; in the Netherlands it makes up 12% of analysed copper artefacts, and Brittany 6% of analysed copper artefacts After 2200 BC there is greater chemical variation in British and Irish copper artefacts, which tallies well with the appearance of other mines in southern Ireland and north Wales. After 2000 BC, other copper sources supersede Ross Island. The latest workings from the Ross Island mines is dated to around 1700 BC.

As well as exporting raw copper/bronze, there were some technical and cultural developments in Ireland that had an important impact on other areas of Europe. Irish food vessels were adopted in northern Britain in  BC and this roughly coincides with a decline in the use of beakers in Britain. The &#x27;bronze halberd&#x27; (not to be confused with the medieval halberd) was a weapon in use in Ireland from 2400–2000 BC. They are essentially broad blades that were mounted horizontally on a meter long handle, giving greater reach and impact than any known contemporary weapon. They were subsequently widely adopted in other parts of Europe, possibly showing a change in the technology of warfare.

====Solar symbolism====

Ireland has the greatest concentration of gold lunulae and stone wrist-guards in Europe. However, neither of these items were deposited in graves and they tend to be found isolated and at random.

In some cases gold lunulae have been found with pairs of gold discs, e.g. at Coggalbeg in Ireland and Cabeceiras de Basto in Portugal. Both lunulae and discs have been linked to sun worship. The archaeologist Mary Cahill connects them to a &quot;great solar cult&quot; stretching across western and central Europe to Scandinavia. Cahill suggests that the central part of the lunulae (which is left undecorated) represents a solar boat, which she compares to the gold boat depicted on the Nebra sky disc and to depictions of solar boats from the Nordic Bronze Age, as well as to depictions on pottery from Los Millares in Spain. According to Cahill, pairs of gold discs found with lunulae may therefore represent &quot;the day and night sun&quot;, symbolising the movement of the sun from day to night and from east to west. The double-sun motif has also been linked to the mythological Divine Twins, as have ritual depositions of twinned objects, including two swords buried with the Nebra sky disc.

Scientific analyses have shown that gold used to make both the Irish lunulae and the Nebra sky disc originated from Cornwall, providing a further link between these artefacts. Cornwall was also the likely source of gold used to make artefacts from the Bush Barrow at Stonehenge. Gold used to make discs from western Asturias (northern Spain) dating from the Bell Beaker period, was similarly found to be of non-local origin and possibly from southern Britain.

===Britain===

Beakers arrived in Britain in 2500 BC, with migrations of Corded Ware-related people, eventually resulting in a near total turnover of the British population. The Beaker-culture declined in use 2200–2100 BC with the emergence of food vessels and cinerary urns and finally fell out of use around 1700 BC. The earliest British beakers were similar to those from the Rhine, but later styles are most similar to those from Ireland. In Britain, domestic assemblages from this period are very rare, making it hard to draw conclusions about many aspects of society. Most British beakers come from funerary contexts.

Britain&#x27;s only unique export in this period is thought to be tin. It was probably gathered in streams in Cornwall and Devon as cassiterite pebbles and traded in this raw, unrefined state. It was used to turn copper into bronze from  BC and widely traded throughout Britain and into Ireland. Other possible European sources of tin are located in Brittany and Iberia, but it is not thought they were exploited so early as these areas did not have bronze until after it was well established in Britain and Ireland. Gold was also exported from Cornwall to Ireland and continental Europe.

The most famous site in Britain from this period is Stonehenge, which had its Neolithic form elaborated extensively. Many barrows surround it and an unusual number of &#x27;rich&#x27; burials can be found nearby, such as the Amesbury Archer and the later Bush Barrow.

Close similarities have been noted between Stonehenge and the Pömmelte circular enclosure in central Germany, which was built by Bell Beaker people around 2300 BC. Large timber circles in Britain such as Woodhenge, near to Stonehenge, are similarly dated to the early Beaker period or just before the Beaker period. Some researchers have suggested that Woodhenge may have been a monumental roofed building, though it is usually thought to have been an open-air structure. Silbury Hill was also built in the early Bell Beaker period, and may have originally been a burial mound, though this has never been proven.

According to Bayliss (2007), the &quot;aggrandisement&quot; of both Stonehenge and Silbury Hill occurred &quot;in close relation to the appearance of novel material culture and practices&quot; introduced by Beaker people. The archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson has noted that a significantly higher level of labour mobilisation was achieved following the arrival of Beaker people in Britain The amount of effort that went into building Silbury Hill was &quot;massively more than Stonehenge&quot;, and its dates coincide exactly with the appearance of Beaker burials. Beaker people also introduced mummification, burial in log coffins and cranial deformation to Britain.

The archaeologist Timothy Darvill has argued that Stonehenge represented a solar calendar, reflecting the spread of solar cosmologies across Northern Europe in the third millennium BC. Darvill has also suggested that the Stonehenge trilithons may have represented twin gods or an early form of the Divine Twins. Other researchers have emphasized the lunar aspects of Stonehenge, such as the apparent alignment of the Station Stone rectangle with the Major Lunar Standstill, which occurs every 18.6 years. Various other astronomical interpretations have been proposed, such as the theory put forward by the astronomers Gerald Hawkins and Fred Hoyle that the ring of 56 Aubrey Holes could have been used to predict lunar eclipses.

Another site of particular interest in this period is Ferriby on the Humber Estuary, where Europe&#x27;s oldest sewn-plank boats were recovered, dating from as early as 2030 BC. These are the oldest known sewn-plank boats in the world outside of Egypt. A later example is the Dover Boat from southern England, dating from 1550 BC.

===Italian Peninsula===

The Italian Peninsula&#x27;s most affected areas are the Po Valley, in particular the area of Lake Garda, and Tuscany. The bell-shaped vases appear in these areas of central and northern Italy as &quot;foreign elements&quot; integrated in the pre-existing Remedello and Rinaldone cultures.

Graves with Beaker artefacts have been discovered in the Brescia area, like that of Ca&#x27; di Marco (Fiesse), while in central Italy, bell-shaped glasses were found in the tomb of Fosso Conicchio (Viterbo).

The Bell Beaker culture was followed by the Polada culture and Proto-Apennine culture.

===Sicily===
The Beaker was introduced in Sicily from Sardinia and spread mainly in the north-west and south-west of the island. In the northwest and in the Palermo kept almost intact its cultural and social characteristics, while in the south-west there was a strong integration with local cultures. The only known single bell-shaped glass in eastern Sicily was found in Syracuse.

===Sardinia===
Sardinia has been in contact with extra-insular communities in Corsica, Tuscany, Liguria and Provence since the Stone Age. From the late third millennium BC on, comb-impressed Beaker ware, as well as other Beaker material in Monte Claro contexts, has been found (mostly in burials, such as Domus de Janas), demonstrating continuing relationships with the western Mediterranean. Elsewhere, Beaker material has been found stratigraphically above Monte Claro and at the end of the Chalcolithic period in association with the related Bronze Age Bonnanaro culture (1800–1600 BC), for which C-14 dates calibrate to  BC. There is virtually no evidence in Sardinia of external contacts in the early second millennia, apart from late Beakers and close parallels between Bonnannaro pottery and that of the North Italian Polada culture.

Like elsewhere in Europe and in the Mediterranean area, the Bell Beaker culture in Sardinia (2100–1800 BC) is characterised by the typical ceramics decorated with overlaid horizontal bands and associated finds: brassards, V-pierced buttons, etc. For the first time, gold items appeared on the island (torc of the tomb of Bingia &#x27;e Monti, Gonnostramatza). The different styles and decorations of the ceramics which succeed through the period allow the division of the Beaker culture in Sardinia into three chronological phases: A1 (2100–2000 BC), A2 (2000–1900 BC), and B (1900–1800 BC). In these various phases is observable the succession of two components of different geographical origin: the first Franco-Iberian, and the second Central European.

It appears likely that Sardinia was the intermediary that brought Beaker culture to Sicily.

===Greece===

Bell Beaker artefacts appear in mainland Greece and the Aegean from 2200–2000 BC. According to Heyd (2013) and Maran (1998) this is explained by the movement of people from the Adriatic Cetina culture into Greece at the transition from Early Helladic II to III. The Cetina culture was a &quot;syncretistic Bell Beaker culture&quot;, splitting off from the Adriatic variant of the Vučedol culture and at the same time incorporating Bell Beaker elements related to those in northern Italy. Kristiansen and Larsson (2005) suggest that migrants from both the Adriatic Cetina culture and the Danube area reached Greece in this period, the latter indicated by close similarities in pottery forms to the Mokrin and Nagyrev cultures. New and more intensive exchange of goods subsequently developed after 1900 BC between Greece and Bell Beaker-derived cultures such as the Únětice culture in central Europe and the Wessex culture in Britain. According to Galaty et al. (2015) a &#x27;warrior culture&#x27; including &quot;ideas related to warrior aristocracy&quot; spread from Europe to Greece through contact with the Cetina culture, along with the tradition of tumulus burial.

===Scandinavia===

In Denmark, large areas of forested land were cleared to be used for pasture and the growing of cereals during the Single Grave culture and in the Late Neolithic Period. Faint traces of Bell Beaker influence can be recognised already in the pottery of the Upper Grave phase of the Single Grave period, and even of the late Ground Grave phase, such as occasional use of AOO-like or zoned decoration and other typical ornamentation, while Bell Beaker associated objects such as wristguards and small copper trinkets, also found their way into this northern territories of the Corded Ware Culture. Domestic sites with Beakers only appear 200–300 years after the first appearance of Bell Beakers in Europe, at the early part of the Danish Late Neolithic Period (LN I) starting at 2350 BC. These sites are concentrated in northern Jutland around the Limfjord and on the Djursland peninsula, largely contemporary to the local Upper Grave Period. In east central Sweden and western Sweden, barbed wire decoration characterised the period 2460–1990 BC, linked to another Beaker derivation of northwestern Europe.

====Stone and copper arms trade====
Northern Jutland has abundant sources of high quality flint, which had previously attracted industrious mining, large-scale production, and the comprehensive exchange of flint objects: notably axes and chisels. The Danish Beaker period, however, was characterised by the manufacture of lanceolate flint daggers, described as a completely new material form without local antecedents in flint and clearly related to the style of daggers circulating elsewhere in Beaker dominated Europe. Presumably Beaker culture spread from here to the remainder of Denmark, and to other regions in Scandinavia and northern Germany as well. Central and eastern Denmark adopted this dagger fashion and, to a limited degree, also archer&#x27;s equipment characteristic to Beaker culture, although here Beaker pottery remained less common. This period in Scandinavian prehistory, from 2400 to 1800 BC, is also known as the Dagger Period.

The spread of metallurgy in Denmark is also intimately related to the Beaker representation in northern Jutland. The LN I metalwork is distributed throughout most of Denmark, but a concentration of early copper and gold coincides with this core region, hence suggesting a connection between Beakers and the introduction of metallurgy. Most LN I metal objects are distinctly influenced by the western European Beaker metal industry, gold sheet ornaments and copper flat axes being the predominant metal objects. The LN I copper flat axes divide into As-Sb-Ni copper, recalling so-called Dutch Bell Beaker copper and the As-Ni copper found occasionally in British and Irish Beaker contexts, the mining region of Dutch Bell Beaker copper being perhaps Brittany; and the Early Bronze Age Singen (As-Sb-Ag-Ni) and Ösenring (As-Sb-Ag) coppers having a central European – probably Alpine – origin.

====Connections with other parts of Beaker culture====

The Beaker group in northern Jutland forms an integrated part of the western European Beaker Culture, while western Jutland provided a link between the Lower Rhine area and northern Jutland. The local fine-ware pottery of Beaker derivation reveal links with other Beaker regions in western Europe, most specifically the Veluwe group at the Lower Rhine (Netherlands). Concurrent introduction of metallurgy shows that some people must have crossed cultural boundaries. Danish Beakers are contemporary with the earliest Early Bronze Age (EBA) of the East Group of Bell Beakers in central Europe, and with the floruit of Beaker cultures of the West Group in western Europe. The latter comprise Veluwe and Epi-Maritime in Continental northwestern Europe and the Middle Style Beakers (Style 2) in insular western Europe.

The interaction between the Beaker groups on the Veluwe Plain and in Jutland must, at least initially, have been quite intensive. All-over ornamented (AOO) and All-over-corded (AOC), and particularly Maritime style beakers are featured, although from a fairly late context and possibly rather of Epi-maritime style, equivalent to the situation in the north of the Netherlands, where Maritime ornamentation continued after it ceased in the central region of Veluwe and were succeeded  BC by beakers of the Veluwe and Epi-Maritime style.

Clusters of Late Neolithic Beaker presence similar to northern Jutland appear as pockets or &quot;islands&quot; of Beaker Culture in northern Europe, such as Mecklenburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and southern Norway. In northern central Poland Beaker-like representations even occur in a contemporary EBA setting. The frequent occurrence of Beaker pottery in settlements points at a large-scaled form of social identity or cultural identity, or perhaps an ethnic identity.

In 2023 a large circular enclosure dating from BC was discovered near the town of Tiel in the province of Gelderland. Described as the &quot;Stonehenge of the Netherlands&quot;, the enclosure consisted of earth banks and ditches with entrances aligned to the solstices and equinoxes. At the centre of the enclosure there was a burial mound containing numerous burials. According to the excavators the enclosure functioned as a solar calendar used to determine &quot;important moments including festival and harvest days&quot;. Wooden longhouses and other burial mounds were found in the immediate vicinity of the site. A glass bead from Mesopotamia dating from BC was also found in the enclosure, indicating that long-distance contacts already existed at this time.

Three gold lunulae have been found in Denmark dating from the Bell Beaker period, and one in the Netherlands.

====Burial practices====

In eastern Denmark and Scania one-person graves occur primarily in flat grave cemeteries. This is a continuation of the burial custom characterising the Scanian Battle-axe Culture, often to continue into the early Late Neolithic. Also in northern Jutland, the body of the deceased was normally arranged lying on its back in an extended position, but a typical Bell Beaker contracted position occurs occasionally. Typical to northern Jutland, however, cremations have been reported, also outside the Beaker core area, once within the context of an almost full Bell Beaker equipment.

====Social transition====

The introductory phase of the manufacture and use of flint daggers,  BC, must all in all be characterised as a period of social change. Apel argued that an institutionalised apprenticeship system must have existed. Craftsmanship was transmitted by inheritance in certain families living in the vicinity of abundant resources of high-quality flint. Debbie Olausson&#x27;s (1997) examinations indicate that flint knapping activities, particularly the manufacture of daggers, reflect a relatively low degree of craft specialisation, probably in the form of a division of labour between households.

Noteworthy was the adoption of European-style woven wool clothes kept together by pins and buttons in contrast to the earlier usage of clothing made of leather and plant fibres. Two-aisled timber houses in Late Neolithic Denmark correspond to similar houses in southern Scandinavia and at least parts of central Scandinavia and lowland northern Germany. In Denmark, this mode of building houses is clearly rooted in a Middle Neolithic tradition. In general, Late Neolithic house building styles were shared over large areas of northern and central Europe. Towards the transition to LN II some farm houses became extraordinarily large.

===End of a distinct Beaker culture===

The cultural concepts originally adopted from Beaker groups at the lower Rhine blended or integrated with local Late Neolithic Culture. For a while the region was set apart from central and eastern Denmark, that evidently related more closely to the early Únětice culture across the Baltic Sea. Before the turn of the millennium the typical Beaker features had gone, their total duration being 200–300 years at the most.

A similar picture of cultural integration is featured among Bell Beakers in central Europe, thus challenging previous theories of Bell Beakers as an elitist or purely super-structural phenomenon. The connection with the East Group Beakers of Únětice had intensified considerably in LN II, thus triggering a new social transformation and innovations in metallurgy that would announce the actual beginning of the Northern Bronze Age.

<doc id="263747" wikidata="Q2373148" url="?curid=263747" title="USS Kearsarge (CV-33)">
<text>USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-33) was one of 24 s completed during or shortly after World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was the third US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named for a Civil War-era steam sloop. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was commissioned in March 1946. Modernized in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), she served in the Korean War, for which she earned two battle stars. In the late 1950s she was further modified to become an anti-submarine carrier (CVS). &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was the recovery ship for the last two crewed Project Mercury space missions in 1962–1963. She completed her career serving in the Vietnam War, earning five battle stars.

She was decommissioned in 1970, and sold for scrap in 1974.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; ships. She was laid down on 1 March 1944 at the New York Navy Yard, and was launched on 5 May 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Gwyneth Fitch (née Conger), wife of Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air). &quot;Kearsarge&quot; commissioned on 2 March 1946, with Captain Francis J. McKenna in command.

KEARSARGE Original Hull Number (CV-12 Renamed to HORNET):
The Chief of Naval Operations had ordered three &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers on 10 May 1940 in anticipation of Congress passing the Two-Ocean Navy Act, although the ship that later became &quot;Hornet&quot; originally had the name &quot;Kearsarge&quot; with the hull number of CV-12. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding on 9 September 1940, and her keel was laid down on 3 August 1942. The seventh was sunk in the Battle of Santa Cruz on 26 October 1942, and the CV-12 hull was renamed &quot;Hornet&quot; shortly afterwards.

==Service history==
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; arrived at her home port of Norfolk, Virginia, on 21 April 1946, and for the next year engaged in training operations along the East Coast and Caribbean. She cleared Norfolk on 7 June 1947 on a midshipmen training cruise to the United Kingdom.

Upon her return to the United States in August, the carrier engaged in maneuvers for 10 months before departing Hampton Roads on 1 June 1948 for duty with the 6th Fleet. Tragedy marked her steaming. Eighteen Navy personnel and ten Marines were unaccounted for after a 50-foot open launch returning some 90 men to the carrier from liberty swamped in the choppy water of Hampton Roads on 31 May. Sixty-eight were recovered.

During her tour in the Mediterranean, units of the 6th Fleet were placed on alert to insure peace in the Middle East. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; returned to Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 2 October, and operated along the Atlantic Coast and the Caribbean until 27 January 1950, when she sailed for the West Coast. The carrier arrived Puget Sound Navy Yard on 23 February, and decommissioned there on 16 June 1950 for the SCB-27A modernization overhaul that would enable her to handle new jet aircraft.

===Korean War===
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; recommissioned on 15 February 1952 with Captain Louis B. French in command. Following shakedown, the carrier cleared San Diego on 11 August for intensive flight training in the Hawaiian Islands. Her readiness complete, she sailed for the Far East to engage in combat missions in the Korean War. Arriving at Yokosuka on 8 September, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; joined the fast carrier Task Force 77 (TF 77) off the east coast of Korea six days later. For the next five months, the carrier&#x27;s planes flew nearly 6,000 sorties against Communist forces in North Korea, unleashing considerable damage on enemy positions. She completed her tour in late February 1953, returning to her home port of San Diego on 17 March. While serving in Korea her classification was changed to CVA-33.

After returning to San Diego, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was used in the filming of the 1954 movie &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; to depict the abortive visit to Admiral William F. Halsey Jr. aboard his unnamed flagship.

===Far East===
&quot;Kearsarge&quot; sailed again for the Far East on 1 July 1953 and operated with the 7th Fleet fast carrier force during the uneasy truce in Korea. The &quot;Mighty Kay&quot; (after three collisions with other ships in a short period of time, including the ocean liner , &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was also nicknamed by some &quot;Rammin Rankin&#x27;s Krashbarge&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Kay-RUNCH&quot;) also kept watch over the Formosa Straits to prevent the Communists from attacking the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; returned to San Diego on 18 January 1954 to resume training operations off California. Clearing San Diego on 7 October, she steamed toward her third deployment to the Far East. While operating with the 7th Fleet, the carrier stood by to assist the Nationalist Chinese in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. From 6–13 February 1955, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; supported units of the fleet in the successful evacuation of 18,000 civilians and 20,000 military personnel from the islands. Her cruise ended at San Diego on 12 May and for the next three years operated on the annual deployment schedule to the Far East and training operations off California.

In 1956–57, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; received the SCB-125 modernization, mainly incorporating a hurricane bow and an angled deck.

During the summer of 1958, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was fitted out as a(n) (antisubmarine warfare) support carrier and reclassified CVS-33. Following intensive training in her new role, the carrier sailed on 5 September 1959 for 7th Fleet operations in the Far East. Early in her tour, Japan was hit with a violent typhoon, and &quot;Kearsarge&quot; played an important role in providing relief to the victims. Her planes landed parties of medical and supply units, while her crew and air group donated clothing and money to the distressed people. After participating in SEATO exercises and 7th Fleet operations, she cleared Yokosuka on 3 March 1960 for her homeward voyage. Three days later in stormy waters 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) off Wake Island, four Russians were rescued after drifting 49 days in disabled landing craft. They were flown back to their country after &quot;Kearsarge&quot; arrived in Alameda, California, on 15 March; and the carrier received thanks from the Soviet Union for this gesture.
A year of training operations preceded her next deployment from San Diego which began on 3 March 1961. The antisubmarine carrier steamed to Southeast Asian waters as the Communists intensified their effort to overthrow the government in Laos. The demonstrations of the 7th Fleet were observed by the enemy and the crisis abated. After six months in the Far East, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; arrived Puget Sound on 1 November for the second phase of her modernizations.

===Project Mercury===

Upon completion of repairs and training, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; departed Long Beach, California, on 1 August 1962 to station herself in the Western Range as a recovery ship in the Project Mercury orbital space flight of astronaut Walter Schirra after splashdown. On 3 October, after a flawless flight, the carrier played her role in the Space Age by retrieving Schirra and his space capsule, &quot;Sigma 7&quot;, and returning him to Honolulu for flight back to the mainland.

&quot;Kearsarge&quot; resumed training exercises, continuing these for six months before arriving Pearl Harbor on 29 April 1963 to once again take part in the space program. The carrier repeated her earlier splashdown recovery by plucking astronaut Gordon Cooper on 16 May 1963 after he orbited the Earth 22 times in his capsule &quot;Faith 7&quot;.

===Vietnam===
She returned the space hero to Pearl Harbor, then departed on 4 June on her eighth cruise to the Far East. Operations with the 7th Fleet included keeping watch on the unsettled problems in Southeast Asia. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; returned to Long Beach on 3 December for training exercises off California.

On 19 June 1964, the antisubmarine carrier was deployed on her ninth Far Eastern cruise. Arriving Yokosuka on 30 July, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was dispatched to the South China Sea, following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the North Vietnamese patrol boat attack on U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin in early August 1964. While U.S. Navy planes destroyed North Vietnam oil and supply depots, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; provided antisubmarine protection for the 7th Fleet. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; returned to Long Beach on 16 December.

After overhaul during the first half of 1965, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; operated off the West Coast and appeared in a 1965 episode of &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; entitled &quot;The Admiral,&quot; with a number of Douglas A-1 Skyraiders painted in Korean War-period colors on her deck for the production. She departed for the Far East on 9 June 1966. Steaming via Hawaii and Japan, she reached &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 8 August and operated off Vietnam through 24 October. The next day she headed for the Kuala Lumpur area and anchored in the Strait of Malacca on the 30th. She returned via Subic Bay to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; on 5 November and operated there through the 23rd. The next day, the carrier started home via Hong Kong and Japan, arriving in San Diego on 20 December. She operated on the West Coast until departing San Diego on 18 August and reached Pearl Harbor 10 days later to prepare for future action.

The carrier entering Pearl Harbor towards the end of the film, Tora! Tora! Tora!, was in fact the Essex-class aircraft carrier USS Kearsarge, returning to port.

Made redundant by the general fleet drawdown of the late 1960s and early 1970s, &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was decommissioned on 13 February 1970. Following three years in the Reserve Fleet, she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in May 1973 and sold for scrap in February 1974.

<text>A scalpel, lancet, or bistoury is a small and extremely sharp bladed instrument used for surgery, anatomical dissection, podiatry and various handicrafts. A lancet is a double-edged scalpel.

Scalpel blades are usually made of hardened and tempered steel, stainless steel, or high carbon steel; in addition, titanium, ceramic, diamond and even obsidian knives are not uncommon. For example, when performing surgery under MRI guidance, steel blades are unusable (the blades would be drawn to the magnets and would also cause image artifacts). Historically, the preferred material for surgical scalpels was silver. Scalpel blades are also offered by some manufacturers with a zirconium nitride–coated edge to improve sharpness and edge retention. Others manufacture blades that are polymer-coated to enhance lubricity during a cut.

Scalpels may be single-use disposable or re-usable. Re-usable scalpels can have permanently attached blades that can be sharpened or, more commonly, removable single-use blades. Disposable scalpels usually have a plastic handle with an extensible blade (like a utility knife) and are used once, then the entire instrument is discarded. Scalpel blades are usually individually packed in sterile pouches but are also offered non-sterile.

Alternatives to scalpels in surgical applications include electrocautery and lasers.

== History ==
Obsidian scalpels older than 2100 BC have been found in a Bronze Age settlement in Turkey. Skulls from the same time and place show signs of brain surgery.

Ancient Egyptians made incisions for embalming with scalpels of sharpened obsidian, a material that is still in use.

The first medical writings of ancient Greeks indicate they were commonly using tools identical to today&#x27;s scalpels around 500 BC. The &quot;amphismela&quot; was an anatomical knife-edged on both sides. The term comes from the Greek &quot;αμφι&quot; (&quot;utrinque&quot;, &quot;on both sides&quot;), and &quot;μελιζω&quot; (&quot;inside&quot;, &quot;I cut&quot;).

Ancient Romans used more than 150 different surgical instruments, including scalpels.

10th century Arab-Spanish surgeon Albucasis invented a retractable scalpel.

The French used an amphismela in the 1700s.

South African scientists showed that a blunt scalpel caused sharp cuts if the blade was subjected to ultrasound. Applications might be in energy-saving paper cutting.

== Operation ==
In the &quot;palmar grip&quot;, also called the &quot;dinner knife&quot; grip, the handle is held with the second through fourth fingers and secured along the base of the thumb, with the index finger extended along the top rear of the blade and the thumb along the side of the handle. This grip is best for initial incisions and larger cuts.

In the &quot;pencil grip&quot;, best used for more accurate cuts with smaller blades (e.g. #15) and the #7 handle, the scalpel is held with the tips of the first and second fingers and the tip of the thumb with the handle resting on the fleshy base of the index finger and thumb.

== Types ==

=== Surgical ===
Surgical scalpels consist of two parts, a blade and a handle. The handles are often reusable, with the blades being replaceable. In medical applications, each blade is only used once (sometimes just for a single, small cut).

The handle is also known as a &quot;B.P. handle&quot;, named after Charles Russell Bard and Morgan Parker, founders of the Bard-Parker Company. Morgan Parker patented the 2-piece scalpel design in 1915 and Bard-Parker developed a method of cold sterilization that would not dull the blades, as did the heat-based method that was previously used.

The handle of medical scalpels come in several basic types. The first is a flat handle used in the #3 and #4 handles. The #7 handle is more like a long writing pen, rounded at the front and flat at the back. A #4 handle is larger than a #3. #5 handles are also common, and are round, with a patterning to ensure a non-slip grip. Blades are manufactured with a corresponding fitment size so that they fit on only one size handle. The following table of blades is incomplete and some blades listed may work with handles not specified here.

A lancet has a double-edged blade and a pointed end for making small incisions or drainage punctures.

=== Handicraft ===
Graphical and model-making scalpels tend to have round handles, with textured grips (either knurled metal or soft plastic). The blade is usually flat and straight, allowing it to be run easily against a straightedge to produce straight cuts.

There are many kinds of graphic arts blades; the most common around the graphic design studio is the #11 blade which is very similar to a #11 surgical blade (q.v.). Other blade shapes are used for wood carving, cutting leather and heavy fabric.

== Safety ==

Rising awareness of the dangers of sharps in a medical environment around the beginning of the 21st century led to the development of various methods of protecting healthcare workers from accidental cuts and puncture wounds. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as many as 1,000 people were subject to accidental needle sticks and lacerations each day in the United States while providing medical care. Additionally, surgeons can expect to suffer hundreds of such injuries over the course of their career. Scalpel blade injuries were among the most frequent sharps injuries, second only to needlesticks. Scalpel injuries made up 7 percent to 8 percent of all sharps injuries in 2001.

&quot;Scalpel Safety&quot; is a term coined to inform users that there are choices available to them to ensure their protection from this common sharps injury.

Safety scalpels are becoming increasingly popular as their prices come down and also on account of legislation such as the Needle Stick Prevention Act, which requires hospitals to minimize the risk of pathogen transmission through needle or scalpel-related accidents.

There are essentially two kinds of disposable safety scalpels offered by various manufacturers. They can be either classified as retractable blade or retractable sheath type. The retractable blade version made by companies such as OX Med Tech, DeRoyal, Jai Surgicals, Swann Morton, and PenBlade are more intuitive to use due to their similarities to a standard box-cutter. Retractable sheath versions have much stronger ergonomic feel for the doctors and are made by companies such as Aditya Dispomed, Aspen Surgical and Southmedic. A few companies have also started to offer a safety scalpel with a reusable metal handle. In such models, the blade is usually protected in a cartridge. Such systems usually require a custom handle and the price of blades and cartridges is considerably more than for conventional surgical blades.

There are various scalpel blade removers on the market that allows users to safely remove blades from the handle, instead of dangerously using fingers or forceps. In the medical field, when taking into account activation rates, the combination of a single-handed scalpel blade remover with a passing tray or a neutral zone was as safe and up to five times safer than a safety scalpel. There are companies which offer a single-handed scalpel blade remover that complies with regulatory requirements such as US Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standards.

The usage of both safety scalpels and a single-handed blade remover, combined with a hands-free passing technique, are potentially effective in reducing scalpel blade injuries. It is up to employers and scalpel users to consider and use safer and more effective scalpel safety measures when feasible.

<doc id="263753" wikidata="Q1560445" url="?curid=263753" title="Rebellions of 1837–1838">
<text>The Rebellions of 1837–1838 (), were two armed uprisings that took place in Lower and Upper Canada in 1837 and 1838. Both rebellions were motivated by frustrations with lack of political reform. A key shared goal was responsible government, which was eventually achieved in the incidents&#x27; aftermath. The rebellions led directly to Lord Durham&#x27;s Report on the Affairs of British North America and to the Act of Union 1840 which partially reformed the British provinces into a unitary system and eventually led to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, which created the contemporary Canadian federation and its government.

==Atlantic context==
Some historians contend that the rebellions in 1837 ought to be viewed in the wider context of the late-18th- and early-19th-century Atlantic Revolutions. The American Revolutionary War of 1775–1783, the French Revolution of 1789–99, the Haitian Revolution of 1791–1804, the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and the rebellions in Spanish America (1810–1825) were inspired by republican ideals, but whether the rebels would have gone so far as to usurp the Crown remains a subject for historical debate. Great Britain&#x27;s Chartists sought the same democratic goals. Ducharme (2006) puts the rebellion in 1837 in the context of the Atlantic Revolutions. He argues that Canadian reformers took their inspiration from the republicanism of the American Revolution. The rebels believed that the right of citizens to participate in the political process through the election of representatives was the most important right, and they sought to make the legislative council elective rather than appointed. Rebellion in Upper Canada (and Lower Canada also) broke out after the 1836 Legislative Assembly elections were corrupted. It seemed then that the reformers&#x27; struggles could only be settled outside the framework of existing colonial institutions. The British military crushed the rebellions, ending any possibility the two Canadas would become republics. Some historians see ties to the Chartist Newport Uprising of 1839 in Wales, suppressed by Sir Francis Bond Head&#x27;s cousin, Sir Edmund Walker Head.

Historians have tended to view the two Canadian rebellions and the subsequent US Patriot War in isolation, without reference to each other, and without reference to the republican impetus they shared. Recent reconsiderations have emphasized that this was a purposeful forgetfulness by the Reformers after the Rebellions, as they attempted to repudiate the bold republicanism of William Lyon Mackenzie, yet steer an acceptable course to national independence under the guise of responsible government. 

==Rebellions==

There were two types of rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. Many of the rebels (including Mackenzie) fled to the United States. Mackenzie established a short-lived &quot;Republic of Canada&quot; on Navy Island in the Niagara River, but withdrew from armed conflict soon thereafter. Charles Duncombe and Robert Nelson, in contrast, helped foment a largely American militia, the Hunters&#x27; Lodge/Frères chasseurs, which organized a convention in Cleveland in September 1838 to declare another Republic of Lower Canada. The Hunters&#x27; Lodges drew on the American members of the radical Equal Rights Party (or &quot;Locofocos&quot;). This organization launched the &quot;Patriot War&quot;, which was suppressed only with the help of the American government. The raids did not end until the rebels and Hunters were defeated at the decisive Battle of Windsor, nearly a year after the first defeat near Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern.

===Similarities===

The constitutions of Upper and Lower Canada differed greatly, but shared a basis on the principle of &quot;mixed monarchy&quot;—a balance of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. The colonies, however, lacked the aristocratic element, and found their non-elective Legislative Councils dominated by local oligarchies that controlled local trade and the institutions of state and religion. In Lower Canada they were known as the Château Clique; in Upper Canada they were known as the Family Compact. Both office-holding oligarchies were affiliated with more broadly based &quot;Tory parties&quot; and opposed by a Reform opposition that demanded a radically more democratic government than existed in each colony.

The governments in both provinces were viewed by the Reformers as illegitimate. In Lower Canada acute conflict between the elected and appointed elements of the legislature brought all legislation to a halt, leaving the Tories to impose Lord John Russell&#x27;s Ten Resolutions, allowing them to rule without accountability to electors. In Upper Canada the 1836 elections had been marred by political violence and fraud organized by the new Lt. Governor, Sir Francis Bond Head. William Lyon Mackenzie and Samuel Lount lost their seats in the result. The Tories passed a bill allowing them to continue to sit in disregard of the established practice of dissolving the House on the death of a monarch (William IV died in June 1837).

In the midst of this crisis of legitimacy, the Atlantic economy was thrown into recession, with the greatest impact being on farmers. These farmers barely survived widespread crop failures in 1836–37, and now faced lawsuits from merchants trying to collect old debts. The collapse of the international financial system imperiled trade and local banks, leaving large numbers in abject poverty.

In response, Reformers in each province organized radical democratic &quot;political unions&quot;. The Political Union movement in Britain was largely credited with the passing of the Great Reform Bill of 1832. In Lower Canada the Patriots organized the Société des Fils de la Liberté (&quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;). William Lyon Mackenzie helped organize the Toronto Political Union in July 1837. Both organizations became the vehicles for politically organizing protests, and eventually rebellion. As the situation in Lower Canada approached crisis the British concentrated their troops there, making it apparent that they planned on using armed force against the Patriots. With no troops left in Upper Canada, an opportunity for a sympathetic revolt was opened.

===Differences===

Since the time of &quot;Lord Durham&#x27;s Report&quot; on the Rebellions, the Lower Canada Rebellion has been attributed to tensions between the British and the French, that the conflict was &quot;&#x27;racial&#x27; and, as a consequence, it was sharper than–indeed fundamentally different from—the milder strife that disturbed &#x27;English&#x27; Upper Canada.&quot; Despite being true, this interpretation understates the republicanism of the Patriots.

The Lower Canada rebellion was widely supported by the populace, due to economic and political subordination of the French Canadians, resulting in mass actions over an extended period of time, such as boycotts, strikes and sabotage. These drew harsh punitive reprisals such as the restriction of civil liberties, the burning of entire villages, and imprisonment or exile of hundreds of men by government troops and militias, which had been concentrated in Lower Canada to deal with the crisis. By contrast, the Upper Canada Rebellion was not as broadly supported by local populations, was quickly quelled by relatively small numbers of pro-government militias and volunteers and was consequently less widespread and brutal by comparison.

==Aftermath==

Those rebels who were arrested in Upper Canada following the 1837 uprisings were put on trial, and most were found guilty of insurrection against the Crown. One of the most severe punishments was the sentencing of 100 Canadian rebels and American sympathizers to life in Britain&#x27;s Australian prison colonies. Many were publicly hanged, most notably Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews. The public hangings of the rebels took place in Court House Square, in between Toronto&#x27;s new jail and courthouse. The Foreman of Public Works, Joseph Sheard, was expected to share in the work of building the scaffold for Lount&#x27;s and Matthews&#x27; execution. However, he claimed the men had done nothing that he wouldn&#x27;t have and refused to assist. The Orange militia stood guard during the execution to deter a rescue.

The root cause of resentment in Upper Canada was not so much against distant rulers in Britain, but rather against the corruption and injustice by local politicians—the so-called &quot;Family Compact&quot;. However, the rebels were not really convicted because their views aligned with the liberalism of the US, and thus caused some kind of offence to the Tory values of the Canadian colonies. Rather, as revealed in the ruling of Chief Justice Sir John Robinson, a Lockean justification was given for the prisoners&#x27; condemnation, and not a Burkean one: the Crown, as protector of the lives, liberty and prosperity of its subjects, could &quot;legitimately demand allegiance to its authority.&quot; Robinson went on to say that those who preferred republicanism over monarchism were free to emigrate, and thus the participants in the uprisings were guilty of treason.

After the rebellions died down, more moderate reformers, such as the political partners Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, gained credibility as an alternative voice to the radicals. They proved to be influential when the British government sent Lord Durham, a prominent reformer, to investigate the cause of the troubles. Among the recommendations in his report was the establishment of responsible government for the colonies, one of the rebels&#x27; original demands (although it was not achieved until 1849). Durham also recommended the merging of Upper and Lower Canada into a single political unit, the Province of Canada (established through the &quot;Act of Union 1840&quot;), which became the nucleus for modern-day Canada. More controversially, he recommended the government-sponsored cultural assimilation of French Canadians to the English language and culture. In fact, the merging of the Upper and Lower Canada was intended to take any form of self-government away from the French Canadians, forcing them into becoming a smaller part of the new, larger, political unit.

In geopolitical terms the Rebellions and the subsequent Patriot War altered the landscape of relations between Britain and British colonial authorities on one hand, and the American government on the other. Both nations were dedicated to a peace policy due to a budding financial crisis and to a sense of perceived disadvantage which both felt equally. Both were legitimately concerned about the disruption in relations which radical ideas might foment through further rebellion and raids. An unprecedented level of cooperation occurred in diplomatic and military circles. Far from the Rebellions being entirely domestic events, the administration of American president Martin Van Buren had little choice but to implement mitigating measures on US soil to prevent escalation. As they evolved into the Patriot War, the Rebellions contributed to the construction of more recent Anglo-American and Canada-US relations.

==Legacy==
In 1937, exactly one century after the Rebellion, the names of William Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau were applied to the Mackenzie–Papineau Battalion or the Mac-Paps, a battalion of officially unrecognised Canadian volunteers who fought on the Republican side in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. In memory of their heritage, the group fought to the rallying cry &quot;The Spirit of 1837 Lives on!&quot;

<text>Douglas James Henning (May 3, 1947 – February 7, 2000) was a Canadian magician, illusionist, escape artist and politician.

==Early life==
Henning was born in the Fort Garry district of Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Henning became interested in magic after seeing the Peruvian magician Richiardi Jr. perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. He subsequently learned a variety of tricks and performed for his relatives. He began practising magic at Oakenwald School in Fort Garry. Later, his family relocated to Oakville, Ontario. Eventually he named himself &quot;The Astounding Hendoo&quot; and started advertising in local newspapers.

After Henning graduated from Oakville Trafalgar High School, he stopped doing magic, not wanting to do it for a living. He felt that there were only two kinds of magicians, &quot;...magicians for kids, and magicians for nightclub acts. I didn&#x27;t want to be either kind.&quot; So, instead, he enrolled and became a student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and studied psychology, in preparation for a medical degree. There, Henning met Ivan Reitman, when he appeared in the 1968 Reitman-directed production of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; in the role of Lonesome Polecat.

To support himself during this time, Henning worked at the Toronto International Airport, loading and unloading crates. He found the work to be too heavy and tiring; so, with the help of his partner Mars Barrick, he formed the partnership of Henning and Mars, and they performed at local bars and nightclubs.

On May 19, 1967, Doug&#x27;s father, an Air Canada pilot, was killed during a training flight when his DC-8-54 crashed near the Ottawa airport (CYOW).

Henning graduated with honours, earning a degree in science and psychology. He subsequently decided to take a couple of years to concentrate on his magic before entering medical school. 

==Career==
Henning and Mars successfully performed with the top entertainers in Canada and travelled from one end of the country to the other.

Henning realized that he needed more theatrical training as well as in the principles of magic. He applied for a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts in the theatre division with a proposal that used the equation that magic plus theatre equals art. Henning was awarded a Canada Council for the Arts grant for $4,000. After being awarded the grant to study the art of magic for a year, he studied mime under Adrian Pecknold as well as dance with a Canadian choreographer. He sifted through magic literature in the hopes of developing an all-around magic education in manipulation and illusionism.

He visited the Magic Castle in Hollywood, California, a private club for magicians. After an impromptu performance in the Wine Cellar, he met resident magician, guru, and fellow Canadian Dai Vernon, known as the Professor. Since the terms of the grant required Henning to study magic, he got up the nerve later in the year to write the Professor and asked him if he could take lessons with him. Thereafter, Henning travelled to Hollywood to study with Vernon and then with another magic great, Slydini, whom he came to consider his primary teacher of magic.

Intending to return magic to its &quot;glory days&quot;, Henning worked to perfect his craft. Garnering financial support, he developed a live theatrical show, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, written by David Cronenberg and directed by Henning&#x27;s college friend Ivan Reitman. Along with music by Howard Shore and co-starring actress Jennifer Dale, Henning created a musical that combined his magic with a dramatic storyline.

Henning borrowed money for the project and spent $5,000 to build and design illusions. They set up a backer&#x27;s audition in Toronto. One man found potential in the project and invested $70,000. It took so long to work out a plot around his illusions that there was time only for two dress rehearsals, neither of which was in the theatre.

The show opened at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, where it broke box-office records. Henning reworked the show after catching the attention of New York producers and took it to Broadway as &quot;The Magic Show&quot;, with songs composed by Stephen Schwartz. Debuting in 1974, the show ran for four and a half years and earned Henning a Tony Award nomination.

Following his Broadway success, Henning approached NBC with the idea of producing a television special. It was not until Henning suggested that he would reproduce live Harry Houdini&#x27;s famous and dangerous water-torture escape—for the first time since Houdini performed it himself—that the NBC executives signed him.

Henning spent the next eight months reworking his stage act for TV and practising the water-torture escape act. More than 50 million viewers tuned in for the December 1975 broadcast of &quot;Doug Henning&#x27;s World of Magic&quot;, hosted by Bill Cosby.

In 1977, Henning co-wrote a biography of Houdini, &quot;Houdini: His Legend and His Magic&quot;. He created illusions for an Earth, Wind and Fire tour in 1979, and for two of singer Michael Jackson&#x27;s concerts, including his 1984 Victory Tour.

In 1983, Henning was the producer and star of the Broadway musical &quot;Merlin&quot;. In 1984, he began a solo Broadway show, &quot;Doug Henning and His World of Magic&quot;.

In 1985, Doug &amp; Debby Henning&#x27;s Wonder Whims, a set of plush toys, were made by Panosh Place and copyrighted by Marvin Glass and Associates. There were a total of six Wonder Whim characters. Each came with an animal friend, a personalized story, and a magic kaleidoscope wand of colors and patterns.

===The &quot;World of Magic&quot; specials===
Henning&#x27;s first &quot;World of Magic&quot; special aired on NBC on December 26, 1975. Henning successfully performed the water torture illusion, although he did not break Houdini&#x27;s time record. Produced by famed talk show host David Susskind and sponsored by Mobil, the show ran live in the eastern United States without commercials. The event was the first of seven annual broadcasts, which eventually brought Henning seven Emmy Award nominations, including two back-to-back in 1976 and 1977 for &quot;World of Magic&quot;.

In December 1976, &quot;Doug Henning&#x27;s World of Magic II&quot; aired, again live and with only two commercial breaks, on NBC. The theme for this show was &quot;Fire, Water and Air&quot; and it was hosted by actor Michael Landon, with guest star Joey Heatherton. The show included Henning vanishing an elephant. A segment of the show featured special guest magician Ricky Jay.

On December 15, 1977, &quot;Doug Henning&#x27;s World of Magic III&quot; aired live with guests Glen Campbell and Sandy Duncan; the hyped illusion was &quot;Walking Through a Brick Wall&quot;.

On December 14, 1978, &quot;Doug Henning&#x27;s World of Magic IV&quot; aired with the theme &quot;A Magical Journey Through Time&quot;; however, due to numerous problems that occurred during the telecast, this was the last special broadcast live.

On February 15, 1979, there was a broadcast of the fifth World of Magic special, which was taped at the Las Vegas Hilton.

&quot;Doug Henning&#x27;s World of Magic VI&quot;, taped at Osmond Studios in Orem, Utah, was broadcast February 22, 1980, on NBC. Bill Cosby made his second appearance as special guest. Marie Osmond also appeared on the program. Several revamped versions of illusions from earlier specials appeared. The finale was an escape and reappearance featuring a huge Rube Goldberg machine.

Henning&#x27;s last TV special was &quot;World of Magic VII&quot; in 1982, which featured guest (as Bruce) Caitlyn Jenner and several revamped versions of illusions from earlier specials. The theme was Henning&#x27;s magical house, with rooms featuring magic from the past, present and future. In the show&#x27;s finale, Henning created the illusion of turning a black horse and a white horse into a zebra.

At the end of each &quot;World of Magic&quot; performance, Henning addressed the audience with the same monologue: &quot;Anything the mind can conceive is possible. Nothing is impossible. All you have to do is look within, and you can realize your fondest dreams. I would like to wish each one of you all of life&#x27;s wonders and a joyful age of enlightenment.&quot;

===Other television appearances===
On May 20, 1974, Henning appeared as a guest on the game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He received two of the four votes and then performed The Metamorphosis trick.

On December 13, 1977, Henning appeared as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. While Henning performed illusions and chatted with host Johnny Carson and his other guests, he also plugged his new book on Houdini and announced his impending marriage to Barbara De Angelis.

In 1979, Henning appeared on &quot;The Crystal Gayle Special&quot;, a variety program starring singer Crystal Gayle and featuring, along with Henning, B.B. King and the Statler Brothers. In 1980, Henning appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, where he performed several tricks. He demonstrated chink-a-chink for Scooter, did a flying handkerchief trick for Kermit the Frog&#x27;s nephew Robin, segmented a Muppet monster into four pieces (and put him together wrong), and performed The Metamorphosis. In December, Henning appeared on &quot;The Osmond Family Christmas Special&quot;, starring the popular brother/sister act Donny and Marie Osmond, as a guest with such entertainers as Peggy Fleming and Greg Evigan, at the time star of NBC&#x27;s &quot;B. J. and the Bear&quot;.

On February 13, 1981, Henning made his seventh appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. This show marked the first time that Henning was Carson&#x27;s first guest.

A version of &quot;The Magic Show&quot; was mounted in Toronto at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. The purpose of this show was to film in front of a live audience of several thousand people for broadcast on CBC Television. Henning came back to the show that had made him a star, and many changes were made for this new production. Most of the cast was changed, including the role of Cal, now performed by Didi Conn. Some script changes were made (the night club was now known as &quot;Chez Manny&quot; and the older, drunk magician was now named &quot;Van Zyskin&quot;). Some of the songs in the Broadway version were also changed (such as the risqué lyrics of Charmin&#x27;s lament), or replaced totally, such as the song &quot;Solid Silver Platform Shoes&quot; (the once popular shoe style, by then out of fashion), which was replaced with &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Take a Magician&quot;. The film version of the production was only aired once on Canadian television, but released on DVD decades later.

Henning was featured in television commercials during 1984 to promote the Plymouth Voyager minivan.

===Retirement===

In the mid-1980s, Henning quit his profession, sold his props, and moved to India in order devote his time to Transcendental Meditation.

In 1993, he released a video for the Natural Law Party of Canada, made up of excerpts from his &quot;World of Magic&quot; specials along with newly recorded linking dialogue detailing his philosophy of how the world&#x27;s problems could be solved by meditation and yogic flying.

==Transcendental Meditation==
Henning had an increasing interest in Transcendental Meditation. He received a Ph.D. in the Science of Creative Intelligence from the Maharishi University in Switzerland.

In 1992, Henning and Transcendental Meditation founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi drafted plans for a $1.5 billion project, Maharishi Veda Land, near Niagara Falls, Ontario, that would &quot;combine astonishing, unique visual and sensory effects, state-of-the-art 3D imagery, and ultra high-tech entertainment technology with his best original magic illusion secrets&quot;. Attractions were to include a building suspended above water and a journey into the heart of a rose, but at the time of Henning&#x27;s death the project&#x27;s status was uncertain.

==Political career==

In 1992, Henning was a Natural Law Party candidate in the United Kingdom&#x27;s general election, contesting the Parliamentary constituency of Blackpool South in Lancashire. As a Canadian citizen, Henning qualified as a candidate under British electoral law, which allows candidates from Commonwealth nations. He finished fourth of four candidates, polling 173 votes. He was senior vice president of the Natural Law Party of Canada (&quot;NLPC&quot;), and ran as the party&#x27;s candidate for the former Toronto riding of Rosedale in the 1993 federal election, finishing sixth out of ten candidates.









==Personal life==
Henning married Barbara De Angelis in 1977. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1981, and Henning married Debby Douillard in the Ladies&#x27; Dome in Fairfield, Iowa, in December of that year.

==Death and legacy==
Henning died at the age of 52 on February 7, 2000, at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, five months after being diagnosed with liver cancer. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean off Redondo Beach, California.

In 2005, a handwritten letter from Henning to James Randi was placed for auction on eBay, unbeknownst to Randi. When Randi learned of it, he announced on his blog that the letter had been &quot;stolen&quot; from his files. A week later, Randi wrote that he &quot;managed to have the sale stopped&quot; and that the letter was back in his possession, but did not elaborate on further details of the controversy. Randi claimed that Henning had immersed himself so thoroughly in Transcendental Meditation that he &quot;abandoned regular medical treatment for liver cancer, continued to pursue his diet of nuts and berries, and died of the disease.&quot;

On June 8, 2010, it was announced that Henning would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. His &quot;Zig Zag Girl&quot; illusion is housed at the American Museum of Magic.

<text>Liver tumors (also known as hepatic tumors) are abnormal growth of liver cells on or in the liver. Several distinct types of tumors can develop in the liver because the liver is made up of various cell types. Liver tumors can be classified as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) growths. They may be discovered on medical imaging (even for a different reason than the cancer itself), and the diagnosis is often confirmed with liver biopsy. Signs and symptoms of liver masses vary from being asymptomatic to patients presenting with an abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, jaundice, or some other liver dysfunction. Treatment varies and is highly specific to the type of liver tumor.

==Classification==

Liver tumors can be broadly classified as benign or malignant:

===Benign===
There are several types of benign liver tumors. They are caused by either abnormal growth of neoplastic cells or in response to liver injury, known as regenerative nodules. One way to categorize benign liver tumors is by their anatomic source, such as hepatocellular, biliary, or stromal.

====Hemangiomas====
Cavernous hemangiomas (also called hepatic hemangioma or liver hemangioma) are the most common type of benign liver tumor, found in of people. They are made up of blood clusters that are surrounded by endothelial cells. These hemangiomas get their blood supply from the hepatic artery and its branches. These tumors are most common in women. The cause of liver hemangiomas remains unknown; however, it may have congenital and genetic components. They are not known to become malignant based on the available existing literature.

Liver hemangiomas do not usually cause symptoms. They are usually small, with sizes up to 10 centimeters. Their size tends to remain stable overtime. However, if the hemangioma is large it can cause abdominal pain, a sense of fullness in right upper abdominal area, heart problems, and coagulation dysfunction. Cavernous hemangiomas are diagnosed with medical imaging (do not usually need biopsy to confirm diagnosis).

Given their benign course and often asymptomatic nature, cavernous hemangiomas are typically diagnosed incidentally (e.g. when medical imaging is obtained for another reason). In terms of management, they are usually monitored with periodic imaging as well as more closely if the person becomes pregnant. If the cavernous hemangioma grows quickly or the patient is symptomatic, further medical intervention is warranted. Therapies include open or laparoscopic surgical resection, arterial embolization, or radio-frequency ablation. In terms of complications of hepatic hemangiomas, it is very rare for a hepatic hemangioma to rupture or bleed.

====Focal nodular hyperplasia====
Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is the second most common benign tumor of the liver. FNH is found in of adults worldwide. FNH is more common in females (10:1 female to male ratio) except in Japan and China, in which there is a more equal prevalence of cases between females and males. FNH is associated with women of childbearing years and has been associated with women taking hormonal oral contraceptives. This tumor is the result of a congenital arteriovenous malformation hepatocyte response. This process is one in which all normal constituents of the liver are present, but the pattern by which they are presented is abnormal.

These tumors usually do not have any symptoms. If large, they may present with abdominal pain. It is common for patients to have multiple distinct liver lesions; however, they do not tend to grow over time and they do not typically convert to malignant tumors. Diagnosis is made mainly with medical imaging, such as ultrasound or MRI with contrast. The majority of FNH have a characteristic &quot;central scar&quot; on contrast-enhanced imaging, which helps to solidify the diagnosis. However, if a central scar is not present on imaging, it is hard to tell the difference between FNH, hepatic adenoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma, in which cases biopsy is the next step to aid in the diagnosis process.

Given the benign nature of FNH and the fact that they rarely progress in size or undergo malignant transformation, FNH tumors are usually managed with clinical monitoring. Surgical indications or arterial embolization for FNH include if the FNH lesion is large, symptomatic, or there is uncertainty surrounding the correct diagnosis.

====Hepatic adenoma====
Hepatocellular adenomas (also called hepatocellular adenoma) are rare benign liver tumors made up of hepatocytes, with estimates indicating hepatocellular adenomas make up 2% of liver tumors. They are most common in women using contraceptives or hormone replacement therapies containing estrogen, women who are pregnant, or people mis-using steroids. They are also associated with glycogen storage diseases (subtypes I and III), and newer studies are suggesting that diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, and dyslipidemia are risk factors for hepatic adenomas.

Hepatocellular adenomas are most often asymptomatic and often found incidentally on imaging. However, if signs and symptoms are present they include non-specific abdominal pain, yellowing of skin, and higher than normal gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase laboratory values. They are, in most cases, located in the right hepatic lobe and are frequently seen as a single lesion. Their size ranges from 1 to 30 cm. They can be difficult to diagnosis with imaging studies alone, because it can be hard to tell the difference between hepatocellular adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Molecular categorization via biopsy and pathological analysis aids in both diagnosis and understanding prognosis, particularly because hepatocellular adenomas have the potential to become malignant. It is important to note, percutaneous biopsy should be avoided, because this method can lead to bleeding or rupture of the adenoma. The best way to biopsy suspected hepatic adenoma is via open or laparoscopic excisional biopsy.

Because hepatocellular adenomas are so rare, there are no clear guidelines for the best course of treatment. The complications, which include malignant transformation, spontaneous hemorrhage, and rupture, are considered when determining the treatment approach Estimates indicate approximately 20-40% of hepatocellular adenomas will undergo spontaneous hemorrhage. The evidence is not well elucidated, but the best available data suggests that the risk of hepatocellular adenoma becoming hepatocellular carcinoma, which is malignant liver tumor, is 4.2% of all cases. Transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma is more common in men. Currently, if the hepatic adenoma is &gt;5 cm, increasing in size, symptomatic lesions, has molecular markers associated with HCC transformation, rising level of liver tumor markers such as alpha fetoprotein, the patient is a male, or has a glycogen storage disorder, the adenoma is recommended to be surgically removed. Like most liver tumors, the anatomy and location of the adenoma determines whether the tumor can removed laparoscopically or if it requires an open surgical procedure. Hepatocellular adenomas are also known to decrease in size when there is decreased estrogen or steroids (e.g. when estrogen-containing contraceptives, steroids are stopped, or post-partum).

Women of childbearing age with hepatic adenomas were previously recommended to avoid becoming pregnant altogether; however, currently a more individualized approach is recommended that takes into account the size of the adenoma and whether surgical resection is possible prior to becoming pregnant. Currently, there is a clinical trial called the Pregnancy and Liver Adenoma Management (PALM) study that is investigating management of hepatic adenomas during pregnancy; however, the results of this trial have not been published as of February 2021.

==== Liver Cell Adenomatosis ====
Liver cell adenomatosis (also called hepatic adenomatosis) is a related but distinct diagnosis from hepatocellular adenoma. On medical imaging and histopathological biopsy results they are the same as hepatic adenomas. Liver cell adenomatosis differs from hepatic adenomas by its definition of more than 10 hepatic adenomas that are in both liver lobes in a person who does not have a glycogen storage disease and is not taking exogenous hormones. Liver cell adenomatosis is not associated with steroid use (e.g. their size does not change when taking or not taking oral contraceptives containing estrogen or anabolic steroids), which is another distinction from hepatic adenomas. Liver cell adenomatosis is associated with liver dysfunction and higher rates of bleeding than hepatic adenomas alone. Available evidence suggests that bleeding occurs in approximately 63% of patients with liver cell adenomatosis. Liver cell adenomatosis is also associated with becoming hepatocellular carcinoma. Like hepatic adenomas, they are diagnosed with imaging and biopsies as needed. Treatment of liver cell adenomatosis is difficult due to the multiple, widespread lesions. Liver imaging should be reviewed to see if it is possible to surgically remove the tumors. Liver transplantation is a treatment option for some patients.

==== Simple Liver Cysts ====
Liver cysts are common. They are fluid-filled contained structures within the liver. Simple liver cysts are seen most commonly in women and kids. In terms of pathophysiology, they are formed in response to developmental events and in response to trauma and inflammation. In addition, liver cysts can be seen with polycystic kidney disease and echinococcosis infection (hydatid disease).

Pseudotumors:

Pseudotumors differ from liver tumors in that they are not a proliferation of abnormal cells but are &quot;local variations&quot; of tissue type. Notably, liver pseudotumors can be confused for a liver tumor on initial imaging studies when diagnostically working up a liver mass. Examples of pseudotumors include: distinct areas of hepatic fibrosis, pockets of fatty liver changes, and inflammatory pseudotumor.

===Cancerous===

* Most cases are metastases from other tumors, frequently of the GI tract (like colon cancer, carcinoid tumors mainly of the appendix, &quot;etc&quot;.), but also from breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer, &quot;etc&quot;.
* The most frequent, malignant, primary liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma.
* Other forms of primary forms of liver cancer include cholangiocarcinoma, mixed tumors, sarcoma, and hepatoblastoma.

==Diagnosis==

Upon discovery of a liver tumor, the main issue in the workup is to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant. Many imaging modalities are used to aid in the diagnosis of malignant liver tumors. These include sonography (ultrasound), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Tumor markers, chemicals sometimes found in the blood of people with cancer, can be helpful in diagnosing and monitoring the course of liver cancers. High levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood can be found in many cases of HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma can be detected with these commonly used tumor markers: carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19–9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125). These tumour markers are found in primary liver cancers, as well as in other cancers and certain other disorders.

===Ultrasound===

Ultrasonography of liver tumors involves two stages: detection and characterization. Tumor detection is based on the performance of the method and should include morphometric information (three axes dimensions, volume) and topographic information (number, location specifying liver segment and lobe/lobes). The specification of these data is important for staging liver tumors and prognosis. Tumor characterization is a complex process based on a sum of criteria leading towards tumor nature definition. Often, other diagnostic procedures, especially interventional ones are no longer necessary. Tumor characterization using the ultrasound method will be based on the following elements: consistency (solid, liquid, mixed), echogenicity, structure appearance (homogeneous or heterogeneous), delineation from adjacent liver parenchyma (capsular, imprecise), elasticity, posterior acoustic enhancement effect, the relation with neighboring organs or structures (displacement, invasion), vasculature (presence and characteristics on Doppler ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).

===Computed tomography===

When evaluating hepatic masses by abdominal computed tomography (CT), it can be advantageous to have both late arterial and portal venous phase images since some tumors enhance briskly during the arterial phase (hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, follicular nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and hypervascular metastasis), but maybe occult or difficult to characterize on portal venous phase imaging alone. However, it should be stressed that the addition of late arterial phase images is only indicated if one of these tumors is suspected, or if there is a need for further characterization of a hepatic mass, since the large majority of patients will not benefit from the addition of this phase. In addition, if there is a need to definitively characterize a hepatic mass, MRI is generally more sensitive and specific, with no associated radiation dose.

<text>Gales Point Manatee is a village in Belize District in the nation of Belize, Central America. The village is bordered by five other communities, namely Mullins River, St. Margaret, La Democracia, Gracie Rock, and Freetown Sibun. The village is bordered east by the Caribbean Sea. In 2000, Gales Point had a population of about 500 people, most of whom subsist on fishing and farming.

Most recently, in 2010, the population was placed at 296.

Gales Point Manatee or Malanti is the local name for the village. The majority of the village’s population lives on a peninsula located in the Southern Lagoon, which is a manatee reserve. The Southern Lagoon&#x27;s water is brackish. This lagoon connects directly to the Caribbean Sea through the Manatee Bar River. It also has of wildlife reserve known as the Gales Point Wild Life Sanctuary.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2010 census, Gales Point had a population of 297. Of these, 89.2% were Creole, 6.1% Mixed, 2.4% East Indian, 0.7% Caucasian, 0.7% Garifuna and 0.3% Mestizo.

== History ==
Ritamae Hyde (2009) recently established that, based on (textual and oral) evidence, Gales Point Manatee was an early maroon community, a settlement made by persons who resisted enslavement by fleeing the control of the colonial authorities and &quot;slave masters&quot; to live in self-sufficient communities in the hinterlands.

It is believed that Gale&#x27;s Point became one of such communities where &quot;ex-enslaved&quot; persons from &quot;nearby areas such as Sibun River, Runaway Creek, Mullins River and Main River&quot; established around the late 1700s and early 1800s (Hyde: 2009, p. 13, 16).

Colonial knowledge of maroonage in British Honduras dates to 1816 when Superintendent Col. George Arthur recorded that there was &quot;a community &#x27;near Shiboon River, very difficult to discover&#x27;&quot; outside the influence of the colonial authorities (quoted in Shoman: 2000, 51).

In 1820, Arthur again made reference to &quot;two Slave Towns, which it appears have been long formed in the Blue Mountains to the Northward of Sibun&quot; (ibid).

In around 1944, Gales Point became the first village in Belize to have a village council. Nurse Cleopatra White, first nurse in the village, recognized the need for managing village affairs and organized a council. Her idea later became the model for the current village council system which has been implemented throughout the country.

== Culture ==
Due to the geographic isolation of Gales Point Manatee from the rest of the country, some traditional African practices continue to be observable (see Iyo, et al. 2007; Hyde: 2009).

=== Food and drinks ===
Like many West African cultures, the people of Manatee were traditionally reliant on ground food and other locally planted crops for subsistence.

Fishing and hunting were also a much greater source of food for the community. For example, fish seré is a dish which is essentially a coconut-milk soup of fish and ground foods (yam, coco, potato, etc.). It may also be served along with white rice.

The people at Manatee are also well known for their homemade wines from local berries and cashews, amongst others fruits.

=== Sambai===
The origin of the word Sambai is not fully known, but Sambai refers to the rhythm style, drum style and event from the village of Gales Point Manatee. The Sambai rhythm is the most unusual aspect of Kriol culture from Manatee (taken from National Kriol Council).

It is theorized that since the escaped slaves, or maroons, were likely first generation slaves, they probably remembered rituals and rhythms from their home in Africa. Since the Goombay (gumbeh) drum was not outlawed until 1790, it&#x27;s easy to say that these rhythms were brought with these escaped slaves to the area near Runaway Creek. It is likely that the rhythms migrated from their origins as the people themselves did carrying with them the flowing and mutating rhythmic dialects of their own style, still strongly rooted in Africa.

The Sambai is by tradition considered a fertility dance and occurs during the full moon cycle. Farmers plant and harvest crops directly related to lunar cycles as well and this may contribute to the reason that the Sambai is considered a fertility ritual. Also, many lyrics are sexual in nature such as:

&quot;Hok-i-nani-beh…here here ….hok-i-nani-beh…koko faiya.&quot;

In recent times the Sambai has developed into simply a social event and is no more a fertility ritual. It is done along with most other nighttime activities involving other dances. 
Elders remember the days when children were not allowed to participate in the Sambai. Although children are allowed to be at a Sambai now the event has not changed much since the old days. A circle of dancers and drummers gather around a pine wood fire. Drummers begin playing and &quot;call&quot; the song then the crowd answers. This &quot;call and response&quot; style is typical of the African tradition. For example:
Call: &quot;Aanti Kala Kala Kalala sohnting so&quot; 
Response: &quot;Aanti noh badi mi&quot;.

The dancers enter one at a time and &quot;Jump Sambai&quot; as it is referred to. When the individual exits the ring he or she chooses the next dancer by pointing to or &quot;reeling in&quot; with a gesture or simply exits next to the person they are calling in.

Often subtle courtships were explored as individuals frequently choose the candidate of their pursuit for the evening. If the person was interested they would return the gesture by choosing back the potential partner. If the person was not interested in the courtship then the discrete lack of reciprocation would be noticed only by the pursuer of the courtship.

=== Story telling ===
Storytelling has always been an important form of entertainment in the village.

The introductions always started with a bizarre exaggeration to make the crowd laugh such as &quot;Back in the day when monkey use to chew tobacco&quot; and ended with the classic Creole line &quot;if the pin neva ben, di story neva end&quot;.

Some of the stories are long and have morals that can only be captured if one pays keen attention.

The story may also change according to the mood of the teller. For example, the storyteller mentioned or integrated Hurricane Richard in two of the stories, making the audience laugh at a recent disaster that affected the community.

=== Outside influences ===
It is important to recognize that culture is always in a process of change due to both internal and external occurrences and influences. 
Gales Point is not in total isolation or unaffected by the broader Belizean cultural lifestyles and &#x27;Western culture&#x27;. 
Many things have changed in the community.

For example, the Sambai is no longer the same. There are more children participating in the dance than actual adults. In the past, no children were allowed to do the Sambai.

People now live in concrete houses as opposed to thatched houses in the past. Processed and canned foods are available in the village. There is a local Christian church. Rastafari, or at least the growing of &#x27;locks&#x27;, is now quite common among the youth (for discussion on Rastafari in Belize, see Lawrence: 2012).

These modern influences at the same time have benefited the community. For example, they now have access to electricity and water. 
There is little economic activity occurring in the village which leads people to migrate out of the community. Many persons hope that increase tourist arrivals will increase the economic activities of the community and decrease outward migration.

== Tourism ==
The village of Gales Point has some tourism, mostly for those interested in seeing the rich ecosystem of the area, including a large West Indian manatee population. It is also possible to camp at Methos Campsite near the end of the point.

At the end of the point is a lodge called Manatee Lodge, which offers hikes, manatee spotting trips, and snorkelling in the Caribbean Sea at nearby islands and cayes.

<doc id="263763" wikidata="Q1186355" url="?curid=263763" title="People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan">
<text>The People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), known as the Homeland Party (Dari: , ) from June 1990, was a Marxist–Leninist political party in Afghanistan established on 1 January 1965. Four members of the party won seats in the 1965 Afghan parliamentary election, reduced to two seats in 1969, albeit both before the party was fully legal. For most of its existence, the party was split between the hardline &quot;Khalq&quot; and moderate &quot;Parcham&quot; factions, each of which claimed to represent the &quot;true&quot; PDPA.

The party adhered to Marxist–Leninist ideology and toed a staunch pro-Soviet political line. The PDPA&#x27;s secret constitution, which was adopted by the party during its founding congress in January 1965 but never publicly released to party cadres, described itself as &quot;the vanguard of the working class and all laborers in Afghanistan&quot; and defined its party ideology as &quot;the practical experience of Marxism–Leninism&quot;. While PDPA&#x27;s internal documents incorporated explicitly Marxist terminology, the party refrained from formally branding itself as &quot;communist&quot; in public, instead using labels such as &quot;national democratic&quot; and &quot;socialist&quot;. PDPA&#x27;s public platform document published in April 1966 asserted that its political objectives involved the creation of a &quot;democratic national government&quot; as well as the long-term goal of establishing a socialist state.

The Khalq-Parcham organizational split erupted within the PDPA in 1967. While the Khalqists adhered to rigid Marxist–Leninist dogma and toed a militant revolutionary line, the Parchamis wanted to establish a &quot;common front&quot; with other left-wing parties. In July 1977, Khalq and Parcham factions re-merged into the PDPA after Soviet mediation, with the objective of preparing a coup against Daoud Khan&#x27;s regime. During the initial period of Khalqist rule from 1978 to 1979, PDPA portrayed itself as advancing a &quot;socialist revolution&quot; in Afghanistan. After the ouster and killing of Hafizullah Amin in a palace coup launched by Soviet military forces in December 1979, a Parchamite-dominated PDPA claimed that its government was facilitating what it described as the &quot;national-democratic stage&quot; of Marxist transformation. In its final years, the party gradually moved away from Marxism–Leninism and towards Afghan nationalism.

While a minority, the party helped Mohammad Daoud Khan, former Prime Minister of Afghanistan, overthrow King Mohammad Zahir Shah in 1973 and establish the Republic of Afghanistan. Initially, the PDPA was highly represented in the government cabinet, but many PDPA officials were later dismissed as relations between the party and President Khan worsened. In 1978, the PDPA, with help from members of the Afghan National Army, seized power from Daoud Khan in what became known as the Saur Revolution. The PDPA led by Nur Muhammad Taraki established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, which would last until 1987. After National Reconciliation talks in 1987, the official name of the country reverted to the Republic of Afghanistan (as it was known before 1978). Under the leadership of Mohammad Najibullah in 1990, the party was renamed the Homeland Party and much of the party&#x27;s symbols and policies were altered or removed. The republic lasted until 1992, when mujahideen rebels seized the capital Kabul and took over the country&#x27;s government. The PDPA was subsequently dissolved, with some officials joining the new government, some joining militias, and others deserting.

==History==
Nur Mohammad Taraki started his political career as an Afghan journalist. On 1 January 1965, Taraki, with Babrak Karmal, established the Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Afghanistan. In the beginning the party ran under the name &quot;People&#x27;s Democratic Tendency&quot;, since secularist and anti-monarchist parties were illegal. The People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) was officially formed at the unity congress of the different factions of the Socialist Party of Afghanistan on 1 January 1965. Twenty-seven men gathered at Taraki&#x27;s house in Kabul, elected Taraki as the first party Secretary General and Karmal as Deputy Secretary General, and chose a five-member Central Committee (also called a Politburo). Taraki was invited to Moscow by the International Department of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) later that year.

The PDPA was known in Afghan society at that time as having strong ties with the Soviet Union. Eventually, the PDPA was able to get three of its members into parliament, in the first free elections in Afghan history; these three parliamentarians were Karmal, Anahita Ratebzad, Nur Ahmed Nur. Later on, Taraki established the first radical newspaper in Afghan history under the name &quot;The Khalq&quot;; the newspaper was eventually forced to stop publishing by the government in 1966.

===Khalq and Parcham===

In 1967 the party divided into several political sects, the biggest being the Khalqs and the Parchams, as well as the Setami Milli and Grohi Kar. These new divisions started because of ideological and economic reasons. Most of Khalqs supporters came from ethnic Pashtuns from the rural areas in the country. The Parchams supporters mostly came from urban citizens who supported social-economic reforms in the country. The Khalqs accused the Parchams of allegiance to King Mohammed Zahir Shah because their newspaper, the &quot;Parcham&quot;, was tolerated by the king and published from March 1968 to July 1969.

Karmal sought, unsuccessfully, to persuade the PDPA Central Committee to censure Taraki&#x27;s excessive radicalism. The vote, however, was close, and Taraki in turn tried to neutralize Karmal by appointing new members to the committee who were his own supporters. After this incident, Karmal offered his resignation, which was accepted by the Politburo. Although the split of the PDPA in 1967 into two groups was never publicly announced, Karmal brought with him less than half the members of the Central Committee.

As a result of the internal strife within the party, the party&#x27;s representation in the Afghan parliament decreased from four to only two seats in the Afghan parliamentary election in 1969. In 1973 the PDPA assisted Mohammed Daoud Khan with a seizure of power from Zahir Shah in a nearly bloodless military coup. After Daoud had seized power, he established Daoud&#x27;s Republic of Afghanistan. After the coup, the Loya jirga approved Daoud&#x27;s new constitution, establishing a presidential one-party system of government in January 1977. The new constitution alienated Daoud from many of his political allies.

=== Reconciliation ===
The Soviet Union set in Moscow played a major role in the reconciliation of the Khalq faction led by Taraki and the Parcham faction led by Karmal. In March 1977, a formal agreement on unity was achieved, and in July the two factions held their first joint conclave in a decade. Since the parties division in 1967 both sides had held contact with Soviet government.

Both parties were consistently pro-Soviet. There are allegations that they accepted financial and other forms of aid from the Soviet embassy and intelligence organs. However, the Soviets were close to King Zahir Shah and his cousin Daoud Khan—the first Afghan President—and it could have damaged their relations. There are no facts proving that the Soviets provided financial help to either Khalqis or Parchamis.

Taraki and Karmal maintained close contact with the Soviet Embassy and its personnel in Kabul, and it appears that Soviet Military Intelligence (&quot;Glavnoye Razvedyvatel&#x27;noye Upravleniye&quot; – GRU) assisted Khalq&#x27;s recruitment of military officers.

=== Saur Revolution ===
In 1978 a prominent member of the PDPA on the Parcham side of the party, Mir Akbar Khyber, is claimed to have been assassinated by the government and its associates. While the government rejected any claims of having assassinated him, the PDPA members apparently feared that Mohammad Daoud Khan was planning to exterminate them all. Shortly after a massive protest against the government during the funeral ceremonies of Khaibar, most of the leaders of PDPA were arrested by the government. With a number of Afghan military officers supporting the Khalq faction of the PDPA wing, Hafizullah Amin stayed out of prison long enough to organize an uprising with the group.

On the eve of the coup, the Afghan police did not send Amin to immediate imprisonment, as it did with the three Politburo members and Taraki on 25 April 1978. His imprisonment was postponed for five hours, during which time he was under house arrest. He gave instructions to the Khalqi military officers through his family before being sent to jail on 26 April 1978.

The regime of President Daoud came to a violent end in the early morning hours of 28 April 1978, when military units from the Kabul military base loyal to the Khalq faction of the party stormed the Presidential Palace in Kabul. The coup was also strategically planned for this date because it was the day before Friday, the Muslim day of worship, and most military commanders and government workers were off duty. Tanks were utilized in the coup d&#x27;état, with Major Aslam Watanjar commanding the tank units. With the help of the Afghan air force led by Colonel Abdul Qadir, the insurgent troops overcame the resistance of the Presidential Guard, assassinated Daoud, and killed most members of his family. Hafizullah Amin renamed the country to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), and Qadir assumed the control of the country from 27 to 30 April 1978 as the Head of the Military Revolutionary Council.

=== New reforms ===

The divided PDPA succeeded the Daoud regime with a new government under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki of the Khalq faction. In Kabul, the initial cabinet appeared to be carefully constructed to alternate ranking positions between Khalqis and Parchamis. Taraki was Prime Minister, Babrak Karmal was senior Deputy Prime Minister, and Hafizullah Amin was foreign minister.

Once in power, the PDP embarked upon a program of rapid modernization centered on separation of Mosque and State, eradication of illiteracy (which at the time stood at 90%), land reform, emancipation of women, and abolition of feudal practices. A Soviet-style national flag replaced the traditional black, red, and green.

Traditional practices that were deemed feudal – such as usury, bride price and forced marriage – were banned, and the minimum age of marriage was raised. The government stressed education for both women and men, and launched an ambitious literacy campaign. Sharia Law was abolished, and men were encouraged to cut off their beards.

These new reforms were not well received by the majority of the Afghan population, particularly in rural areas; many Afghans saw them as un-Islamic and as a forced approach to Western culture in Afghan society. Most of the government&#x27;s new policies clashed directly with the traditional Afghan understanding of Islam, making religion one of the only forces capable of unifying the tribally and ethnically divided population against the unpopular new government, and ushering in the advent of Islamist participation in Afghan politics.

The first signs of a rebellion appeared on 20 July 1978 in the far eastern provinces of Nuristan and Kunar.

===Repression===
The new government launched a campaign of repression, which killed thousands, mostly at Pul-e-Charkhi prison. Estimates for the number executed at the prison, between April 1978 and December 1979, are as high as 27,000.

Despite accusations and predictions by conservative elements, a year and a half after the coup no restrictions had been placed on religious practice.

=== Parcham rule ===

In the 1979 Soviet Operation Storm-333, the Soviet special force Spetsnaz stormed the Tajbeg Palace and killed PDPA general secretary Hafizullah Amin. The death of Amin led to Babrak Karmal becoming the new Afghan leader and General Secretary of the PDPA, and marked the beginning of the Soviet-Afghan War.

According to photographic evidence, the PDPA established its own tea brand which would be handed out to government employees, contractors and factory workers under Parcham rule. 

The Khalq-Parcham rivalry remained in place. Clashes between members often resulted in fatalities, with rival gangs of each side firing at each other.

Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal&#x27;s inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the CPSU, said:

Additionally, some Afghan soldiers who had fought for the socialist government began to defect or leave the army. In May 1986, Karmal was replaced as party general secretary by Mohammad Najibullah, and six months later he was relieved of the presidency. His successor as head of state was Haji Mohammad Chamkani. Karmal then moved (or, allegedly, was exiled) to Moscow.

=== National reconciliation ===

After the Soviet Union had leveled most of the villages south and east of Kabul, creating a massive humanitarian disaster, the demise of the PDPA continued with the rise of the Mujahideen guerrillas, who were trained in Pakistani camps with US support. Between 1982 and 1992, the number of people recruited by Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency to join the insurgency topped 100,000.

The Soviet Union withdrew in 1989, but continued to provide military assistance worth billions of dollars to the PDPA regime until the USSR&#x27;s collapse in 1991.

==== Homeland Party ====
The Soviet troop withdrawal in late 1989 changed the political structure that had enabled the PDPA to stay in power all those years. Inner collapse of the government started when Gulbuddin Hekmatyar withdrew his support for the government. Later in March 1990 Defense Minister and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Shahnawaz Tanai tried to seize power in a military coup. The coup failed and Tanai was forced to flee the country. Najibullah still hung on to the presidency, so in June 1990 he renamed the party the &quot;Homeland Party&quot;. The party dropped the Marxist–Leninist ideology that had been held previously by the PDPA.

In 1991, the USSR dissolved and all support for the government stopped after Boris Yeltsin came into power. In April 1992, the PDPA regime in Afghanistan collapsed after the sudden change of allegiance of General Abdul Rashid Dostum following President Najibullah&#x27;s resignation. Post-Najibullah interim leader Abdul Rahim Hatif agreed on 22 April 1992 to a rebel-led state. The party was banned on May 6, 1992, by the Jamiat-i Islami Government.

== Ideology ==
Since 1919, the Soviet Union had strongly influenced Afghan politics, economy and military (see Soviet–Afghan relations before 1979).
The thousands of Afghan academic students and military trainees in the USSR were compelled to study Marxism–Leninism and the international communist movement; some of them became communists. Nur Muhammad Taraki, the first PDPA General Secretary in 1978, had worked and studied in India in 1932, had met members of the Communist Party of India there, and had become a communist. Hafizullah Amin, the second PDPA General Secretary, had seen his leftist beliefs strengthened during his studies in the United States in the late 1950s. Taraki and Babrak Karmal (the third PDPA General Secretary) were Soviet agents since the 1950s.

From its inception in 1965 until at least 1984, the PDPA labeled themselves &quot;national democratic&quot;, not communist; however, in its view of international relations, the PDPA was clearly pro-Soviet oriented. The party also publicly asserted that their desired changes could be achieved peacefully, however their ultimate goal was a revolution, and they were aware that it could only be accomplished through violence. The secret party constitution of 1965 called for &quot;expanding and strengthening Afghan-Soviet friendly relations&quot;. A party history in 1976 stated, &quot;The party struggles against imperialism, particularly American imperialism and its ally, Maoism, and is fighting alongside our brother parties, foremost among them the Leninist party of the Soviet Union.&quot;
In a 1978 party pamphlet, the PDPA described itself as a &quot;vanguard of the working class&quot; and General Secretary Taraki as an &quot;experienced Marxist–Leninist&quot;. These descriptions led Western authors to label PDPA as either of &quot;clear Marxist orientation&quot;, &quot;an avowedly pro-Soviet socialist movement&quot;, or reformist &quot;with a socialist bent&quot;. The PDPA&#x27;s party constitution leaked in 1978 explicitly mentioned Marxism-Leninism as the future of Afghanistan and by the end of 1978, Amin declared the Saur revolution as the &quot;continuation of [the] Great October Revolution&quot;, leaving no doubts about the PDPA&#x27;s orientation.

After the April 1978 PDPA coup d&#x27;état, PDPA general secretary Taraki stated that the PDPA were nationalists and revolutionaries but not communists, and declared a commitment to Islam within a secular state. Once in power, however, it became clear that the PDPA was dominated by an urban intelligentsia and lacked any real social base in the overwhelmingly rural and Islamic communities of Afghanistan. The party launched a programme ranging from land redistribution to emancipation and education of women, which violated traditional customs, religious laws, and the balance of power between Kabul and the rural localities. The radical reform program, class-struggle, anti-imperialistic rhetoric, the signing of a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union, increased presence of Soviet advisers in the country, and support of countries like Cuba and North Korea led to the international media and domestic opponents giving the label of &quot;communist&quot; to the PDPA.

Pro-Najibists relaunched the &quot;Hezb-e Watan&quot; in 2004 and again in 2017.

==Organization==
===Congress===
* 1st Congress (1967)
* 2nd Congress (1987)

====Conference====
====Central Committee====
In the period April 1978 – September 1979 the Central Committee contained 38 individuals, of these, 12 were either purged, imprisoned or executed on the orders of Taraki after the Saur Revolution. With Taraki&#x27;s ouster and execution in 1979, another member was removed. During Hafizullah Amin&#x27;s short rule, September–December 1979, the Central Committee had at most 33 members, 12 of which were appointed by him. Upon Babrak Karmal&#x27;s ascension to power 25 members were either executed or purged on his orders (76% of the members). He reinstated 14 members (including himself), who had been purged by either Taraki or Amin, appointed 15 newcomers and retained 7 Amin appointees. The Central Committee now contained 36 members. A year later, in June 1981, 10 new members were appointed to the Central Committee (the body now containing a record high 46 members), in a bid to increase the representation of Parchamites. Two years later, in 1983, six more members were appointed, with the Central Committee now containing 52 full members and 27 candidate members. Of these 52 members, only three had held offices continuously through Taraki&#x27;s, Amin&#x27;s and Karmal&#x27;s rule; they were Abdur Rashid Arian, Mohammed Ismail Danesh and Saleh Mohammad Zeary (often referred to as a Khalqist).

====Central Auditing Commission====
====Statute====

===Central Committee apparatus===
====General Secretary, Politburo and Secretariat====

The Politburo and Secretariat were elected by a plenum of the Central Committee, exactly as how it was done within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). As in the CPSU, the Politburo was the main executive and legislative body of the PDPA when the congress, conference nor the Central Committee were in session. All decisions of the Politburo were implemented by the Secretariat, a body concurrently in session with the Politburo.

Throughout its existence, the body usually had between 7 and 9 members. During Taraki&#x27;s rule, 10 members had held seats in the PDPA Politburo, this was reduced to seven by Amin (only four members from the Taraki period were retained under Amin), and it was increased back to nine by Karmal. 6 members from the Amin period were either executed or disappeared, and Karmal turned the Politburo into a Parcham-dominated body. In the immediate aftermath of the Saur Revolution, there was &quot;almost an even balance&quot; between the Khalqist and the Parchamites in the body, but Khalqist representation was continuously increased under they formed a majority under Amin. The Politburo had one female member throughout its existence; Anahita Ratebzad. Unlike the Soviet practices the PDPA did not publish the list of Politburo members according to rank, but rather by alphabetical order. There is one exception however, and it was published in the book &quot;Handbook for Party Activists of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan&quot; (published after the 6th Plenary Session of the 1st Central Committee in June 1981).
* Nur Muhammad Taraki, 1965–1979
* Hafizullah Amin, 1979
* Babrak Karmal, 1979–1986
* Mohammad Najibullah, 1986–1992

====Supervisory and Control Commission====
====Subordinate bodies====
The PDPA Central Committee had several specialized commissions which handled day-to-day affairs. For instance, the party had the International Relations Commission, responsible for PDPA&#x27;s relations with other parties, the Organization Commission, responsible for personnel appointments nationwide, and the Defense and Judicial Commission, responsible for military policy.

===Lower-level organizations===
From 1982 onward, the PDPA experienced an organizational expansion into the countryside. For instance, in 1982 there existed 144 district and sub-district party committees, by mid-1984 it had increased to 205. Out of Afghanistan&#x27;s fifty-five border districts, fifteen of them lacked a primary party organization (PPO), another nineteen had only one PPO in each district, and in the remaining twenty-one the party, while better organized, remained ineffective. Despite this, in the period 1982 to 1987 the PDPA did witness an organizational growth; witnessing a growth of PPOs form 443 to 1,331. However, the main problem facing the party was that it was not organized in the small villages scattering Afghanistan; out of an estimated 25,000 villages which existed in Afghanistan, the party was organized in an estimated 2,000. Another daunting problem was that the central party leadership had little contact with lower-level organizations in the provinces or, in general, with the people. In 1987, during Najibullah&#x27;s rule, village-level party secretaries were appointed to the Central Committee in a bid to strengthen central-local contact. Concurrently, a threefold increase in visits by central party personnel to the provinces occurred, in another bid to strengthen the party&#x27;s contact with the PDPA&#x27;s lower-level and non-members alike.

A major problem throughout PDPA&#x27;s rule was that the majority of mid-level cadres resided in Kabul, rather than the places they were responsible for. Of the 10,000 mid-level cadres in the mid-1980s, 5,000 of them resided in Kabul. For instance, in the period 1982–83 the governor of Faryab province only visited the province during the winter months, since the mujahideen withdrew their troops from the area during those months. Another problem, in Faryab province the PDPA was inactive and the majority of the locals believed that Mohammad Daoud Khan, the president which the communists overthrew in 1978, was still ruling the country. Another case, that of Nangrahar province (in which the government was in complete control) faced a similar problem; the party organization laying dormant. To solve this problem, the PDPA sought to improve the cadres&#x27; education by enrolling them to educational institutions within the PDPA, public universities or giving them educational opportunities in the Eastern Bloc or the Soviet Union. The Social Science Institute of the PDPA had a capacity of 2,500 students, and by the end of the 1980s it had given degrees to over 10,000 individuals. Despite all this, the main problem facing the party was the unsafe conditions facing party members serving in the countryside; for instance, when the Ghazni Provincial Committee convened for a meeting the participants had to wait for three months to get home (waiting for an armoured column and a helicopter).

====Membership====
The PDPA had 5,000 to 7,000 members upon taking power. However, author Bruce Amstutz believes that PDPA membership probably stood at around 6,000 when Karmal took power. A little over a year later, the membership was estimated to stand between 10,000 and 15,000. By 1984, the party had between 20,000 and 40,000 members (this figure included both ordinary and probationary members), as a result of concerted membership drives in government institutions, state-owned enterprises, and the military. However, at the 1st PDPA Conference, Karmal claimed that the party had 62,820 ordinary and probationary members; this number was exaggerated. The conference reported a growth of 21,700 members since August 1981. From then until a party meeting in 1983, leading party officials claimed the party had between 63,000 and 70,000 members. Half of the members in 1982, were in the armed forces (which was dominated by the Khalqists). In August 1982, Karmal alleged that the PDPA had 20,000 members within the military, and said that &quot;the army party organization forms the greatest part of the PDPA&quot;. Earlier that year, in March, Soviet sources stated that the largest concentration of PDPA members were to be found in Kabul Polytechnic Institute (with an estimated 600 members) and at Kabul University (with an estimated 1,000 members). In 1983, Karmal claimed that party membership had grown 35% to 90,000, the following year it had allegedly grown 33% to 120,000 members.

While the membership increase did make the PDPA look more powerful than it really was, the increase was concurrently followed with increased indiscipline amongst members (a majority joined because of sheer opportunism). Before the 1973 coup led by Mohammad Daoud Khan, the vast majority of members either had &quot;graduates of junior colleges or colleges&quot;, with many of them either being students or working in the public sector. After the 1973 coup, the Khalqist began recruiting members amongst the Officers Corps, which was proven successful by the takeover of 1978. However, in the aftermath of the coup, membership decreased notably (probably because of the increasing authoritarian policies of the government). By 1979, only the most blatant opportunists would be willing to join the party; the party was at its nadir. After the Soviet intervention, the Soviets forced the PDPA to recruit more members; in 1981 the probationary period for a new member was reduced from one year to six months, and to join a person needed fewer party sponsors. The 1981–83 recruitment drive increased party membership; the majority of the new members worked either in state-owned enterprises, the military. The main problem was that most of these new recruits were &quot;functional illiterate&quot;, which in reality led to an overall decline in the quality of party members. In April 1981, 25–30% of members were &quot;workers, farmers, soldiers, and other toilers&quot;; this increased to 38% (both ordinary and probationary members) in 1982 and in 1983, according to Karmal, 28.4% were ordinary members.

===Democratic Youth Organization===
== Receivers ==
In 1997, Watan Party of Afghanistan was formed, which made attempts to register the old name of the PDPA, but the party was refused registration.

In 2003, the National United Party of Afghanistan, which sought to unite former PDPA members, was registered.

<text>St. George&#x27;s Caye (Spanish: Cayo San Jorge) is an island in the Caribbean Sea, eight miles east of Belize City. It is part of the Belize District of Belize, Central America. The village on the island is also known as St. George&#x27;s Caye. As of 2000, St. George&#x27;s Caye had a permanent population of about 20 people.

St. George&#x27;s Caye was previously known by the Spaniards as &quot;Cayo Cocina&quot;, or &quot;Kitchen Cay&quot;. It was settled as a town in 1650, and was the largest settlement in what was then British Honduras in the 17th century and 18th century; however, its importance was eventually eclipsed by the growth of Belize City. St.George&#x27;s Caye was Belize&#x27;s first capital in the 1700s. Following Spanish Capture of Cayo Cocina in 1779, from 3 September through 10 September 1798, British settlers fought and defeated a small Spanish fleet sent to drive them from the area; this battle is marked as a national holiday in Belize each September 10 as the Battle of St. George&#x27;s Caye.

The British Army had an adventure training establishment on the island, allowing members of the British Forces stationed at the nearby British Army Training and Support Unit Belize (BATSUB) and their families a chance to take part in such activities as diving and sailing. However, the army decided to close the BATSUB in the late 20th century.

Aside from several private residences, the island also has St. George&#x27;s Caye Resort. Resort activities focus on diving, sailing, and snorkeling.

<doc id="263768" wikidata="Q2296351" url="?curid=263768" title="Bumper sticker">
<text>A bumper sticker is an adhesive label or sticker designed to be attached to the rear of a car or truck, often on the bumper. They are commonly sized at around 25.4 cm by 7.6 cm (10 in by 3 in) and are typically made of PVC.

Bumper stickers serve various purposes, including personal expression, promotion, humor, or political activism. They encompass commercial, religious, secular, military, and sports-related themes, allowing individuals to showcase affiliations or support for various causes, regions, or groups. While they are widely used in the United States to display political support during elections, their prevalence is comparatively lower in countries like the United Kingdom.

Before the emergence of bumper stickers, advertising took various forms, including horsefly nets, metal or cardboard bumper signs, and window shield decals. The advancement of fluorescent inks during World War II and the accessibility of pressure-sensitive and adhesive materials in the post-war period played a significant role in the development and widespread adoption of bumper stickers.

==Purpose==

Bumper stickers can be commercial, religious, secular, humorous, or in support of a sports team or other organization. They may promote or oppose a particular philosophical or political position. Or they may go a different route and show a funny cartoon or punchline. In some countries, such as the United States, bumper stickers are a popular way of showing support for a candidate for a government seat and become more common during election years. In others, such as the United Kingdom, they are rarely seen in any form.

One variety of bumper stickers is the country tag. This is typically used for cars crossing international borders, and is overseen by the United Nations as the &quot;Distinguishing Signs of Vehicles in International Traffic&quot;, being authorized by the UN&#x27;s Geneva Convention on Road Traffic (1949) and Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968). Often the country code is displayed on the license plate itself.

These have (usually in the United States) been appropriated into tags indicating a country with which the driver affiliates, or more humorously to indicate things like a region (OBX), support for rabbit rescue groups (BUN), etc.

People who opt to exhibit their individuality through these decals may take part in more acts of road rage. Colorado State University social psychologist William Szlemko found that aggressive driving is linked to the number of markers a person has on their car, regardless of the messages portrayed.

==Application and removal==

Early bumper stickers had printed directions on the back removable liner for applying them to the bumper of a car. Due to the movement of the vehicle and changing weather conditions, the sticker needed to adhere well to the bumper surface.

There are some &quot;easy to remove&quot; bumper stickers and magnetic bumper stickers. Bumper stickers can be removed with a razor blade, penetrating oil or a heat gun. Home remedies also include using common household items, such as WD-40 or paint thinner.

==History==

Before bumper stickers, advertisers used other methods of displaying their wares. In the horse-drawn carriage era, advertisers printed on horsefly nets with the name of a business. In the 1930s and 1940s, bumper signs were printed on metal or cardboard and wired to the chrome bumpers. Lester Dill, promoter of Meramec Caverns in Missouri, was an ardent adopter of the bumper sign to attract motorists to his site. Using a windowshield decal was another option. These paper strips could be wetted and placed inside a car window. However, these strips did not hold up well when placed on a bumper.

Various factors contributed to the development of the bumper sticker. Developments in material manufacturing during World War II led to the widespread use of daylight fluorescent inks, which were invented by Bob Switzer and his brother Joe. These inks appeared to glow during the daytime and were useful to support various wartime activities; they were favored by early bumper sticker manufacturers after the war. In addition, the first commercially produced pressure-sensitive stickers appeared after World War II; new developments in adhesive materials led to the production of paper strips with adhesive on the back. In addition, increased use of vinyl by the general public after World War II led to the eventual use of this material in bumper stickers.

Many experts credit Forest P. Gill, a silkscreen printer from Kansas City, USA, as the developer of the bumper sticker. Gill recognized that the self-adhesive paper used during the second world war could be used to advertise promotional products in the late 1940s and beyond.

Early widespread uses of the advertising bumper sticker were for tourist attractions, such as Marine Gardens, Florida, Seven Falls, Colorado, Meramec Caverns in Missouri, and Lookout Mountain, Tennessee. Another popular advertisement was the &quot;See Rock City&quot; sticker. In the 1940s and 1950s, visitors to the site had a sticker applied to their car, which duplicated the famous signs painted on the roofs of barns throughout the southeastern USA. Tourist attraction staff would circulate through the parking lot, applying the promotional sticker to every car.

The first documented presidential election that used adhesive bumper stickers in political campaigns was the 1952 election between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson II. Bumper stickers allowed citizens to show support for a candidate while still maintaining some anonymity.

Bumper stickers have caused legal issues between people and states. In 1989, a man with a bumper sticker containing indecent wording was convicted. The man&#x27;s conviction was reversed in &quot;Cunningham v. State&quot; (1991). The court referenced the First Amendment, stating &quot;the provision regulating profane words on bumper stickers reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech and unconstitutionally restricts freedom of expression&quot;.

== Around the world ==

Considerable variation exists around the world as to the context and purpose of stickers. For example many Veterans and military family members use military and war related stickers on their cars.

They have also been extensively applied to rear windows as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use. For instance, in Sweden, this is the normal place to put them; bumper stickers are referred to as &quot;bakrutedekal&quot; in Swedish, meaning &quot;rear window decal&quot;.

More recently, bumper stickers have become a route for advertising and a few companies offer to match car owners to advertisers willing to pay for the ad.

&quot;Shirat Hasticker&quot; (&quot;The Sticker Song&quot;) by Hadag Nachash is an Israeli song composed entirely of bumper sticker slogans.

Variants of the bumper sticker have developed in recent years, including vinyl decals meant to be applied to a car&#x27;s rear windshield, and chrome emblems to be affixed to the body of the car itself, generally on the rear (the &quot;Jesus fish&quot; and its &quot;Darwin fish&quot; counterpart are popular examples).

License plate frames and vanity plates can serve a similar purpose to bumper stickers, although the law may place restrictions on messages they display.

<doc id="263774" wikidata="Q647533" url="?curid=263774" title="Cotinga">
<text>The cotingas are a large family, Cotingidae, of suboscine passerine birds found in Central America and tropical South America. Cotingas are birds of forests or forest edges, that are primary frugivorous. They all have broad bills with hooked tips, rounded wings, and strong legs. They range in size from of the fiery-throated fruiteater (&quot;Pipreola chlorolepidota&quot;) up to of the Amazonian umbrellabird (&quot;Cephalopterus ornatus&quot;).

==Description==
Cotingas vary widely in social structure. There is a roughly 50/50 divide in the family between species with biparental care, and those in which the males play no part in raising the young. The purple-throated fruitcrow lives in mixed-sex groups in which one female lays an egg and the others help provide insects to the chick.

In cotinga species where only the females care for the eggs and young, the males have striking courtship displays, often grouped together in leks. Such sexual selection results in the males of these species, including the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, being brightly coloured, or decorated with plumes or wattles, like the umbrellabirds, with their umbrella-like crest and long throat wattles. Other lekking cotingids like the bellbirds and screaming piha, have distinctive and far-carrying calls. In such canopy-dwelling genera as &quot;Carpodectes&quot;, &quot;Cotinga&quot;, and &quot;Xipholena&quot;, males gather high in a single tree or in adjacent trees, but male cocks-of-the-rock, as befits their more terrestrial lives, give their elaborate displays in leks on the ground.

The females of both lekking and biparental species are duller than the males.

==Breeding==
Nests range from tiny to very large. Many species lay a single egg in a nest so flimsy that the egg can be seen from underneath. This may make the nests hard for predators to find. Fruiteaters build more solid cup nests, and the cocks-of-the-rock attach their mud nests to cliffs. The nests may be open cups or little platforms with loosely woven plant material, usually placed in a tree.
The clutches comprise one to four eggs. Incubation typically takes 15–28 days. 
Fledging usually occurs at 28–33 days.

==Habitat==
Deserts, open woodlands, coastal mangroves, and humid tropical forests comprise their habitats. Cotingas face very serious threats from the loss of their habitats.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family Cotingidae was introduced by French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1849. According to the International Ornithological Committee, as of July 2021, the family contains 66 species divided into 24 genera.

A 2014 molecular phylogenetic study of the cotingas by Jacob Berv and Richard Prum found that the genera formed five monophyletic clades and they proposed that the family could be divided into five subfamilies. The following cladogram is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the suboscines by Michael Harvey and collaborators published in 2020.

The genus &quot;Tijuca&quot; was found to be embedded in &quot;Lipaugus&quot;, a position that was confirmed by a more detailed 2020 study.

A number of species previously placed in this family are now placed in the family Tityridae (genera &quot;Laniisoma&quot;, &quot;Laniocera&quot; and &quot;Iodopleura&quot;)

<text>The La Ferté-Alais Air Show is an annual meeting of aviation enthusiasts, flight organizations, companies, and pilots in the village of La Ferté-Alais, France.

It takes place during Pentecost at the Cerny airfield (ICAO: LFFQ), which is owned and operated by the &quot;Amicale Jean-Baptiste Salis&quot; (AJBS). The airfield is also the site of the Musée Volant Salis, hosting 70 aircraft from the past century.

In preparation for the airshow, dozens of vintage aircraft are come from Europe and the US for display and flight demonstrations. 

The show regularly starts with a flight demonstration of vintage aircraft such as the Blériot XI and Stearman. It is then usually followed with an aerobatic and pyrotechnic display of warbirds such as the T-6 texan and T-28 Trojan. The French Air Force (Armée de l&#x27;Air) then often presents some of the aircraft in their fleet, such as the Rafale, Atlantique and Mirage aircraft. The French Sécurite Civile sometimes comes to demonstrate their technology such as water bombers and surveillance helicopters. This is followed by personal presentations of special individual aircraft performing aerobatics and flight demonstrations. The airshow usually ends with demonstrations by the Patrouille de France and Rafale Solo Display.

On rare occasions, Air France performs a flyby with their flagship aircraft, such as the Concorde in 1988 or the Boeing 777 in 2019.

== Media Presence ==
The B-17 Flying Fortress &quot;The Pink Lady&quot; used in the motion picture Memphis Belle is a permanent project of the AJBS group.

<doc id="263780" wikidata="Q461021" url="?curid=263780" title="Formicariidae">
<text>Formicariidae is a family of smallish suboscine passerine birds of subtropical and tropical Central and South America known as antthrushes. They are between in length, and are most closely related to the ovenbirds in the family Furnariidae, and the tapaculos in the family Rhinocryptidae. The family Formicariidae contains 12 species in two genera.

These are forest birds that tend to feed on insects at or near the ground. Most are drab in appearance with shades of (rusty) brown, black, and white being their dominant tones. Compared to other birds that specialize in following ants, this family is the most tied to the ground. The long, powerful legs (which lend the birds a distinctive upright posture) and an essentially vestigial tail aid this lifestyle.

They lay two or three eggs in a nest in a tree, both sexes incubating.

==Systematics==
The antthrushes are similar in appearance to small rails. Their sexes are alike in plumage, and they walk like starlings. The &quot;thrush&quot; part of the name refers only to the similarity in size (and in &quot;Chamaeza&quot; also coloration) to true thrushes, not to an evolutionary relationship.

Molecular phylogenetic studies indicated that the Formicariidae as previously delimited were highly paraphyletic, judging from comparison of several mt and nDNA sequences. The aberrant bar-bellied &quot;antpittas&quot; of the genus &quot;Pittasoma,&quot; which were formerly placed here, belong to the gnateater family (which initially was also considered part of the Formicariidae); as the gnateaters proper, they are sexually dichromatic. In addition, the true antpittas formerly placed in this family are now found in their own family, the Grallariidae. On the other hand, at least a large proportion of the Rhinocryptidae (tapaculos), including the type genus &quot;Rhinocrypta&quot;, seem to be closer to the antthrushes, but are still considered a distinct family.

The following cladogram shows the phylogeny of the antthrush family. It is based on a large molecular phylogenetic study of the suboscines by Michael Harvey and collaborators that was published in 2020. The species are those recognised by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).

The short-tailed antthrush was found to be paraphyletic. Eleven subspecies are recognised in several disjunct areas and ornithologists had suspected that more than a single species was involved.

<doc id="263789" wikidata="Q1027867" url="?curid=263789" title="Antpitta">
<text>Grallariidae is a family of smallish suboscine passerine birds of subtropical and tropical Central and South America known as antpittas. They are between 10 and 20 cm (4–8 in) in length, and are related to the antbirds, Thamnophilidae, and gnateaters, Conopophagidae. 

The antpittas were formerly placed in the family Formicariidae. Beginning in 2002 a series of molecular genetic studies found that Formicariidae, as then defined, was non-monophyletic. In 2008, the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union reorganised the genera to create monophyletic families and moved the antpittas to their own family Grallariidae. This family now contains 68 species in one large and four fairly small genera.

These are forest birds that tend to feed at or near the ground since many are specialist ant eaters. Most are drab in appearance with shades of (rusty) brown, black, and white being their dominant tones. Compared to other birds that specialize in following ants, this family is the most tied to the ground. The long, powerful legs (which lend the birds a distinctive upright posture) and an essentially vestigial tail aid this lifestyle.

The antpittas are sexually monomorphic; they resemble the true pittas in that they are virtually tailless; they hop like some thrushes, and are much easier to hear than see—although their vocalizations may be rather atypical for perching birds.

They lay 1 to 6 eggs in a nest in a tree, both sexes incubating.

==Taxonomy==
The following cladogram shows the phylogeny of the antipitta family. It is based on a large molecular phylogenetic study of the suboscines by Michael Harvey and collaborators that was published in 2020. The three species in the genus &quot;Myrmothera&quot; were found to be embedded in the genus &quot;Hylopezus&quot;. The species are those recognised by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).
===Species===
Typical antpittas – tribe Grallariini/subfamily Grallariinae
* Genus &quot;Grallaria&quot; (47 species)

Lesser antpittas – possibly tribe Myrmotherini/subfamily Myrmotherinae

<text>Sir Colin Earl Meads (3 June 1936 – 20 August 2017) was a New Zealand rugby union player. He played 55 test matches (133 games), most frequently in the lock forward position, for New Zealand&#x27;s national team, the All Blacks, from 1957 until 1971.

Meads is widely considered one of the greatest players in history. Nicknamed &#x27;Pinetree&#x27; due to his physical presence, he was an
icon within New Zealand rugby, and was named the country&#x27;s Player of the Century at the NZRFU Awards in 1999.

==Early life and family==
Colin Earl Meads was born to Vere Meads and Ida Meads (née Gray) on 3 June 1936, in the town of Cambridge in the Waikato region. His father Vere was a descendant of early settlers Joseph Meads and Ann Meads (née Coates), who emigrated to New Zealand from England in 1842. Vere&#x27;s grandfather Zachariah Meads was among the first British children to be born in Te Aro, Wellington, in 1843, and his grandmother Elizabeth Meads (née Lazare) was the daughter of an Irish minister who had educated freed slaves on the island of Mauritius before emigrating to Wanganui.
Vere and his wife raised their five children on a sheep farm near Te Kūiti. Meads credited the farming lifestyle for his strong physique and high level of fitness. Meads&#x27; brother Stanley Meads was also a noted rugby player, playing 30 matches as an All Black. In 11 matches Stanley and Colin locked the All Black scrum.

Meads and his wife Verna had five children: Karen Stockman, Kelvin Meads, Rhonda Wilcox (who represented New Zealand in the Silver Ferns netball team), Glynn &#x27;Pinecone&#x27; Meads (who also played and managed rugby for provincial side King Country) and youngest daughter Shelley Mitchell (who played for the New Zealand women&#x27;s basketball team). Meads raised his family on a farm on the outskirts of Te Kūiti and continued to live in the area until his death in 2017.

==Rugby career==
Meads played his club rugby throughout his career for Waitete R.F.C in Te Kūiti. He played his first game for King Country in 1955 against Counties, at the age of 19. He had a memorable game, scoring a try, and even a drop-goal (an unusual feat for a lock). He would play a further 138 games for the province.

In 1955 Meads was also selected for the New Zealand under 21 side which toured Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He &quot;played all eight matches, scored three tries and was recognised by the Rugby Almanack as one of the 1955 season&#x27;s most promising players.&quot; In 1956 Meads played in national trials and was selected for the North Island team as a loose forward, but was considered too young to play for the All Blacks against the Springboks.

Meads was selected for the 1957 tour of Australia. He played in ten matches and made his test debut, against the Wallabies. He played both tests, scoring a try in the second. Although normally a lock, he played at flanker and number 8, and even wing (from where he scored a try), as the All Black team was strong on locks. From 1957 until 1971 Meads was effectively an automatic pick for the All Blacks, missing selection for just two series; the British &amp; Irish Lions in 1959 and Australia in 1962. There are differing accounts of how he acquired his nickname &quot;Pinetree&quot;. Roger Boon believes he was the first to come up with the name in 1955. Alternatively, when he toured Japan in the New Zealand Under-23 team in 1958 teammate Ken Briscoe gave him the nickname and it stuck.

He was named captain of the All Blacks 11 times, his first in a 23–9 victory over the Combined Services during the 1963–64 tour of Britain. His captaincy debut for the All Blacks in a test match came in his final series against the Lions in 1971. His final international game ended in a 14–14 draw, giving the Lions a 2–1 series victory, their only series win over the All Blacks. He seriously injured his back in a Land Rover accident at the end of the year and never played for the All Blacks again. Meads recovered enough to continue playing for King Country for two more years before retiring, amassing a total of 361 first class matches, a record that stood for 42 years.

His strength and high threshold for pain became legendary — best illustrated when in a game against Eastern Transvaal in South Africa, in which he emerged from a particularly vicious ruck with his arm dangling horribly, with an obvious fracture, yet completed the match. When the doctor cut away his shirt and confirmed the break, Meads muttered, &quot;At least we won the bloody game.&quot; He missed the first two Tests, but returned for the third with his still broken arm held together by a thin guard. Another incident occurred when Meads was kicked in the head, causing a large gash. The All Blacks doctor at the time wanted to take him to hospital so they could use anaesthetic, but Meads ordered him to do it right there in the dressing room.

He also had the reputation of being a &quot;hard man&quot; and &quot;an enforcer&quot;. Benoit Dauga, the player Meads thought had kicked him in the head, ended up with a broken nose. South African center John Gainsford once tried to challenge Meads, who proceeded to hold his wrists in a grip that was &quot;like being held in a band of steel&quot; and simply said &quot;Don&#x27;t bother, son.&quot; Meads considered the Welsh player Rhys Williams and Irishman Willie John McBride just as hard as himself. However, he considered the &quot;one-eyed Springbok&quot; Martin Pelser as his toughest opponent.

Meads was involved in some controversial incidents. In 1967, he was sent off by Irish referee Kevin D. Kelleher for dangerous play against at Murrayfield, becoming only the second All Black suspended in a test match at the time. The British newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said of the incident that &#x27;For one with Meads&#x27; worldwide reputation for robust play, this was rather like sending a burglar to prison for a parking offence.&#x27;

In Australia he is notorious for having ended the career of Ken Catchpole by wrenching Catchpole&#x27;s leg while he was pinned down, tearing his hamstring off the bone and severely rupturing his groin muscles. Meads says he was just trying to put him on the ground and did not realise his other leg was pinned. Years later he was invited to a dinner in Catchpole&#x27;s honour, but was warned off by the organisers saying he would get booed off the stage. Meads saw that as more of a reason why he should attend and did so without receiving any boos.

==After retirement==

After retiring as a player in 1973, Meads became chairman of the King Country union, and spent time selecting and coaching the now-defunct North Island rugby team. In 1986 he was elected to the national selection panel, but was fired later in the year for acting as coach to the unauthorised New Zealand Cavaliers tour of apartheid South Africa, where the All Blacks were no longer allowed to tour. In 1992 he was elected to the New Zealand Rugby Union council and remained there for four years. In 1994 and 1995 he was All Blacks manager, which included the 1995 Rugby World Cup. He was uncompromising in this role, not afraid to let loose at his players when they played poorly.

Despite his retirement from rugby, Meads remained a familiar face to many New Zealanders. He was a frequent public speaker at events, donating money raised to buy a farm for people with intellectual disabilities. He also appeared on television advertising products ranging from tanalised fence posts to finance companies. He was seen by many as the public face of Provincial Finance, he described the company as &quot;solid as, I&#x27;d say&quot; in an advertisement, and was later criticised when it went bankrupt. He regretted doing the ad and was sorry so many people lost money when it failed. Despite this Meads was named the third most trusted New Zealander after Victoria Cross holder Willie Apiata and triple Olympic gold medallist Peter Snell in 2008.

In 2007 the Meads sold their sheep farm so they could move into Te Kūiti.

In August 2016 it was announced that Meads had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, following several months of illness. He died on 20 August 2017, as a result of cancer. As a mark of respect many New Zealanders placed rugby balls outside the front doors of their homes.

Meads is buried in the Te Kuiti New Cemetery.

==Honours and tributes==
Meads is regarded by many as New Zealand&#x27;s greatest ever rugby player, and was named Player of the Century at the NZRFU Awards dinner in 1999. He is a member of both the World Rugby Hall of Fame and the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame, and was a member of the International Rugby Hall of Fame before its merger with the World Rugby Hall in 2014. The International Rugby Hall of Fame considers him to have been &#x27;the most famous forward in world rugby throughout the 1960s&#x27;.

Meads was considered by many to be a tough, uncompromising, loyal and humble person. At tall and weighing , he was a similar size to many other players of the era. He had a large physical presence though, being very strong and having a high level of fitness. Meads credited this to growing up and working on a farm.

In the 1971 New Year Honours, Meads was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to rugby. He was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (CNZM) for services to rugby and the community, in the 2001 New Year Honours. In the 2009 Special Honours, following the restoration of titular honours by the New Zealand government, Meads accepted redesignation as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM). On 19 June 2017, during the then-ongoing British &amp; Irish Lions tour, a statue of Meads was unveiled in the Te Kuiti town centre. Despite his ongoing battle with cancer, Meads attended and spoke at the unveiling.

One of the other trophies contested in New Zealand&#x27;s domestic competition, the Heartland Championship, is named the Meads Cup in his honour. Rugby writer Lindsay Knight wrote that &quot;As a sporting legend Meads is New Zealand&#x27;s equivalent of Australia&#x27;s Sir Donald Bradman or the United States of America&#x27;s Babe Ruth.&quot;

<doc id="263797" wikidata="Q2086468" url="?curid=263797" title="Nice Work">
<text>Nice Work is a 1988 novel by British author David Lodge. It is the final volume of Lodge&#x27;s &quot;Campus Trilogy&quot;, after &quot;Changing Places&quot; (1975) and &quot;Small World: An Academic Romance&quot; (1984). &quot;Nice Work&quot; won the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; Book of the Year award in 1988 and was also shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

The larger socioeconomic background to the novel was the economic policies and education cuts during the Thatcher government. Lodge was inspired, in part, by his experiences of shadowing a friend who supervised an engineering firm.

The year following its publication, the book was adapted in a four-part TV series for the BBC.

==Plot summary==
Set in 1986, in the fictional city of Rummidge, the book describes the relationship between Robyn Penrose, a feminist university teacher specialising in the industrial novel and women&#x27;s writing and Vic Wilcox, the manager of J. Pringle &amp; Sons Casting &amp; General Engineering (&quot;Pringle&#x27;s&quot;). Robyn is a temporary lecturer at Rummidge, where her boss is Professor Philip Swallow. Swallow is head of the English Department but is also Dean of Rummidge&#x27;s Arts Faculty. Robyn has the temporary lectureship at Rummidge because of the time demands of Swallow&#x27;s new administrative responsibilities.

As part of the &quot;Industry Year Shadow Scheme&quot;, the university is required to send one of its faculty into a local factory. Robyn is the chosen faculty member from Rummidge and the chosen factory is Pringle&#x27;s, where Robyn is to shadow Vic Wilcox and observe the inner workings of a real-life foundry, which she has never seen.

The novel also traces the separate private lives of Robyn and Vic. In the Wilcox family are Vic, his father, his wife Marjorie and his children. Separately, Robyn goes through various stages of her long-standing relationship with her boyfriend, Charles, a fellow literary scholar. Later in the novel, to Robyn&#x27;s discomfort, after she has completed her time at Pringle&#x27;s, the shadow scheme reverses, with Vic shadowing her during her teaching at Rummidge. The philosophical conflict between the ideologies of industry and academe come to the fore. Later, away from Vic, Professor Morris Zapp, a friend of Swallow&#x27;s from the fictional American university Euphoric State (based on UC Berkeley), and a character from the earlier two novels in the Campus Trilogy, pays a brief visit to Rummidge on his way to a conference. He learns about Robyn&#x27;s work for the first time and is impressed. Zapp tries to arrange for Robyn to have a job interview at Euphoric State for an open faculty position, to run interference against his ex-wife, whom Euphoric State&#x27;s faculty is trying to recruit for the post. The uncertainty in Robyn&#x27;s professional status comes from whether she will be able to find a permanent post anywhere, in the context of national budget reductions to the universities.

The relationship between Robyn and Vic reveals their weaknesses. Robyn&#x27;s academic position is precarious because of national budget cuts to education and the universities. Vic has to deal with industrial politics at Pringle&#x27;s. The plot is a pastiche of the industrial novel genre, alluding to &quot;North and South&quot; by Elizabeth Gaskell. This gentle ribbing acts to undermine the postmodern and feminist position of Robyn, who accepts the hand of fate despite ridiculing its role as the sole restorative capable (in the minds of authors of industrial novels) of elevating the female to a serious social position. Robyn acquires insight into the pragmatic ethos whose encroachment on university culture she resents and about the physical reality of factories of which her only prior knowledge was literature. In his turn, Vic learns to appreciate the symbolic or semiotic dimension of his environment and discovers a romanticism within himself that he had previously despised in his everyday life.

==Adaptation==
In 1989, the BBC broadcast a four-part TV miniseries based on the novel, with a screenplay by Lodge. Directed by Christopher Menaul, the series featured Haydn Gwynne as Robyn Penrose and Warren Clarke as Vic Wilcox. The University of Birmingham served as the filming location of many of the scenes from this series. The series won the 1989 Royal Television Society award for best drama series.

<text>Nicholas John Tate (born 18 June 1942) is an Australian actor. He is best known for his roles as pilot Alan Carter in the 1970s science fiction series &quot;&quot; and James Hamilton in the 1980s soap opera &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;. He has also had a successful voiceover career in movie trailers, animation and video games.

==Early life==
Tate was born on 18 June 1942 in Sydney, New South Wales. His parents were the actors John Tate and Neva Carr Glyn. His maternal grandparents were also actors, originally from Ireland and Great Britain, who performed in vaudeville. His father, of Russian descent, also had a connection to the works of &quot;&quot; creator Gerry Anderson, being a secondary voice actor in &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

Tate grew up amongst parties and opening nights, and was often back stage while his parents performed in the theatre. He acted in all his school plays, before being scouted by the Sydney Opera Company to play Amahl in Menotti’s light opera &quot;Amahl and the Night Visitors&quot;.

At the age of twelve, Tate&#x27;s parents separated. The same year, as an avid surfer, he joined Sydney&#x27;s Mona Vale Surf Club, where the club captain was actor Rod Taylor.

==Career==

Wanting to direct, Tate joined the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) which was starting up Australian television. A television role as the singing telegram boy in Thornton Wilder’s &quot;Skin of our Teeth&quot; prompted Tate to quit school. He graduated from studio hand to assistant director, while working on a variety of series. In 1964 he joined an actors&#x27; workshop as his interest turned to acting, but unsure of what direction to take, he joined the Australian commandos for a year. Eventually, his surfing skills afforded him a lead role as a surfer in the thriller miniseries &quot;The Purple Jacaranda&quot;.

Tate&#x27;s big break came with a lead role in the award-winning Australian television series &quot;My Brother Jack&quot;, followed by a stage production of the musical &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; where he played &#x27;Nicholas the Gallant&#x27; for eighteen months on tour throughout the country. This was followed by the 1970 Australian television series &quot;Dynasty&quot; about a rich, powerful family, where he joined his father John Tate for the first time onscreen – the two playing father and son roles.

Tate portrayed astronaut Alan Carter in the British science fiction series &quot;&quot;, which was broadcast from 1975 to 1977, though the series began production in late 1973. In 1976, he broke through in film with an AACTA award-winning role in the movie &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Playground&quot;. He continued to work in film with supporting roles in a number of theatrical films, including &quot;The Year My Voice Broke&quot;, Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, &quot;Return from the River Kwai&quot;, &quot;Evil Angels&quot;, and Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Hook&quot;. From 1985 to 1986, he portrayed James Hamilton in the Australian soap opera &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;. Tate has also made guest appearances on numerous American TV shows, such as &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (in the 1990 episode &quot;Final Mission&quot;), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (in the 1998 episode &quot;Honor Among Thieves&quot;), &quot;Farscape&quot; and in the &quot;Lost&quot; episode &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;.

On stage, Tate appeared in the TRIP (Tony Rudlin Ingrid Pitt Productions) stage production of &quot;Duty Free&quot; (later known as &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother to Dress&quot;), by &quot;Emmerdale&quot; writer Neville Siggs, which ran from 1976 to 1977 at the Bristol Hippodrome. In 2006 he played the leading role of Captain Edward J. Smith in the Australian premiere of the musical &quot;Titanic&quot;.

Tate is also known for his voiceover work in Hollywood theatrical trailers for such films as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, &quot;Austin Powers&quot;, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;Goldeneye&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;The World is not Enough&quot; and &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; and clip-on bumpers for Sony Pictures Home Entertainment from 2005–2006. He has also voiced in commercials, including Lexus, Kodak and HP, and Guinness beer spots airing from 2006. Tate and four other well-known voice artists (Don LaFontaine, John Leader, Mark Elliot, and Al Chalk) parodied their individual voiceover styles &quot;en route&quot; to an awards show in a 1997 short film, &quot;5 Men and a Limo&quot;. He has also performed voiceover work in various video games, including the voice for the Australian tycoon Ozzie Mandrill in the 2000 game &quot;Escape from Monkey Island&quot;.

Tate resides in both Australia and the US.

==Personal life==
Tate married his wife, Hazel Butterfield at Dulwich College Chapel, UK in September 1977, and their son Thomas was born in 1979. They moved to Australia in 1981, where they had a second child, Jessie Josephine in 1986. Through Tom and Jessie, they have three grandchildren.

Tate also has a keen interest in technical drawing and carpentry, and has designed and built seven of his family homes.

<doc id="263800" wikidata="Q168525" url="?curid=263800" title="Tadpole">
<text>A tadpole or polliwog (also spelled pollywog) is the larval stage in the biological life cycle of an amphibian. Most tadpoles are fully aquatic, though some species of amphibians have tadpoles that are terrestrial. Tadpoles have some fish-like features that may not be found in adult amphibians, such as a lateral line, gills and swimming tails. As they undergo metamorphosis, they start to develop functional lungs for breathing air, and the diet of tadpoles changes drastically.

A few amphibians, such as some members of the frog family Brevicipitidae, undergo direct development i.e., they do not undergo a free-living larval stage as tadpoles instead emerging from eggs as fully formed &quot;froglet&quot; miniatures of the adult morphology. Some other species hatch into tadpoles underneath the skin of the female adult or are kept in a pouch until after metamorphosis. Having no hard skeletons, it might be expected that tadpole fossils would not exist. However, traces of biofilms have been preserved and fossil tadpoles have been found dating back to the Middle Jurassic.

Tadpoles are eaten as human food in some parts of the world and are mentioned in various folk tales from around the world.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;tadpole&quot; is from Middle English &#x27;, made up of the elements &#x27;, &#x27;toad&#x27;, and &#x27;, &#x27;head&#x27; (modern English &quot;poll&quot;). Similarly, &quot;pollywog&quot; / &quot;polliwog&quot; is from Middle English &#x27;, made up of the same &#x27;, &#x27;head&#x27;, and &#x27;, &#x27;to wiggle&#x27;.

==General description==
The life cycle of all amphibians involves a larval stage that is intermediate between embryo and adult. In most cases this larval stage is a limbless free-living organism that has a tail and is referred to as a tadpole, although in a few cases (e.g., in the &quot;Breviceps&quot; and &quot;Probreviceps&quot; genera of frogs) direct development occurs in which the larval stage is confined within the egg. Tadpoles of frogs are mostly herbivorous, while tadpoles of salamanders and caecilians are carnivorous.

=== Anura ===

Tadpoles of frogs and toads are usually globular, with a laterally compressed tail with which they swim by lateral undulation. When first hatched, anuran tadpoles have external gills that are eventually covered by skin, forming an opercular chamber with internal gills vented by spiracles. Depending on the species, there can be two spiracles on both sides of the body, a single spiracle on the underside near the vent, or a single spiracle on the left side of the body. Newly hatched tadpoles are also equipped with a cement gland which allows them to attach to objects. The tadpoles have a cartilaginous skeleton and a notochord which eventually develops into a proper spinal cord.

Anuran tadpoles are usually herbivorous, feeding on soft decaying plant matter. The gut of most tadpoles is long and spiral-shaped to efficiently digest organic matter and can be seen through the bellies of many species. Though many tadpoles will feed on dead animals if available to them, only a few species of frog have strictly carnivorous tadpoles, an example being the frogs of the family Ceratophryidae, their cannibalistic tadpoles having wide gaping mouths with which they devour other organisms, including other tadpoles. Another example is the tadpoles of the New Mexico spadefoot toad (&quot;Spea multiplicata&quot;) which will develop a carnivorous diet along with a broader head, larger jaw muscles, and a shorter gut if food is scarce, allowing them to consume fairy shrimp and their smaller herbivorous siblings. A few genera such as Pipidae and Microhylidae have species whose tadpoles are filter feeders that swim through the water column feeding on plankton. Megophrys tadpoles feed at the water surface using unusual funnel-shaped mouths.
As a frog tadpole matures it gradually develops its limbs, with the back legs growing first and the front legs second. The tail is absorbed into the body using apoptosis. Lungs develop around the time as the legs start growing, and tadpoles at this stage will often swim to the surface and gulp air. During the final stages of metamorphosis, the tadpole&#x27;s mouth changes from a small, enclosed mouth at the front of the head to a large mouth the same width as the head. The intestines shorten as they transition from a herbivorous diet to the carnivorous diet of adult frogs.

Tadpoles vary greatly in size, both during their development and between species. For example, in a single family, Megophryidae, length of late-stage tadpoles varies between and . The tadpoles of the paradoxical frog (&quot;Pseudis paradoxa)&quot; can reach up to , the longest of any frog, before shrinking to a mere snout-to-vent length of 3.4–7.6 cm (1.3–3.0 in).

While most anuran tadpoles inhabit wetlands, ponds, vernal pools, and other small bodies of water with slow moving water, a few species are adapted to different environments. Some frogs have terrestrial tadpoles, such as the family Ranixalidae, whose tadpoles are found in wet crevices near streams. The tadpoles of &quot;Micrixalus herrei&quot; are adapted to a fossorial lifestyle, with a muscular body and tail, eyes covered by a layer of skin, and reduced pigment. Several frogs have stream dwelling tadpoles equipped with a strong oral sucker that allows them to hold onto rocks in fast flowing water, two examples being the Indian purple frog (&quot;Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis&quot;) and the tailed frogs (Ascaphus) of Western North America. Although there are no marine tadpoles, the tadpoles of the crab-eating frog can cope with brackish water.

Some anurans will provide parental care towards their tadpoles. Frogs of the genus Afrixalus will lay their eggs on leaves above water, folding the leaves around the eggs for protection. Female Pipa frogs will embed the eggs into their backs where they get covered by a thin layer of skin. The eggs will hatch underneath her skin and grow, eventually leaving as either large tadpoles (such as in &quot;Pipa parva&quot;) or as fully formed froglets (&quot;Pipa pipa&quot;). Female marsupial frogs (Hemiphractidae) will carry eggs on her back for various amounts of time, with it going as far as letting the tadpoles develop into tiny froglets in a pouch. Male African bullfrogs (&quot;Pyxicephalus adspersus&quot;) will keep watch over their tadpoles, attacking anything that might be a potential threat, even though he may eat some of the tadpoles himself.

Males of the Emei mustache toads (&quot;Leptobrachium boringii&quot;) will construct nests along riverbanks where they breed with females and keep watch over the eggs, losing as much as 7.3% of their body mass in the time they spend protecting the nest. Male midwife toads (&quot;Alytes&quot;) will carry eggs between their legs to protect them from predators, eventually releasing them into a body of water when they are ready to hatch. Poison dart frogs (Dendrobatidae) will carry their tadpoles to various locations, usually phytotelma, where they remain until metamorphosis. Some female dart frogs such as the strawberry poison dart frog (&quot;Oophaga pumilio&quot;) will regularly lay unfertilized eggs for the developing tadpoles to feed on.

==Fossil record==
Despite their soft-bodied nature and lack of mineralised hard parts, fossil tadpoles (around 10 cm in length) have been recovered from Upper Miocene strata. They are preserved by virtue of biofilms, with more robust structures (the jaw and bones) preserved as a carbon film. In Miocene fossils from Libros, Spain, the brain case is preserved in calcium carbonate, and the nerve cord in calcium phosphate. Other parts of the tadpoles&#x27; bodies exist as organic remains and bacterial biofilms, with sedimentary detritus present in the gut. Tadpole remains with telltale external gills are also known from several labyrinthodont groups. The oldest unambiguous fossil, a tadpole of the species &quot;Notobatrachus deguistioi&quot; from the Middle Jurassic, was published on in 2024.

==Human use==
Tadpoles are used in a variety of cuisines. Tadpoles of the megophryid frog &quot;Oreolalax rhodostigmatus&quot; are particularly large, more than in length, and are collected for human consumption in China. In Peru &quot;Telmatobius mayoloi&quot; tadpoles are collected for both food and medicine.

==Mythology and history==
According to Sir George Scott, in the origin myths of the Wa people in China and Myanmar, the first Wa originated from two female ancestors &quot;Ya Htawm&quot; and &quot;Ya Htai&quot;, who spent their early phase as tadpoles (&quot;&quot;) in a lake in the Wa country known as &quot;Nawng Hkaeo&quot;.

<text>Alien hand syndrome (AHS) or Dr. Strangelove syndrome is a category of conditions in which a person experiences their limbs acting seemingly on their own, without conscious control over the actions. There are a variety of clinical conditions that fall under this category, most commonly affecting the left hand. There are many similar terms for the various forms of the condition, but they are often used inappropriately. The affected person may sometimes reach for objects and manipulate them without wanting to do so, even to the point of having to use the controllable hand to restrain the alien hand. The occurrence of alien hand syndrome can be usefully conceptualized as a phenomenon reflecting a functional &quot;disentanglement&quot; between thought and action.

Alien hand syndrome is best documented in cases where a person has had the two hemispheres of their brain surgically separated, a procedure sometimes used to relieve the symptoms of extreme cases of epilepsy and epileptic psychosis, e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy. It also occurs in some cases after brain surgery, stroke, infection, tumor, aneurysm, migraine and specific degenerative brain conditions such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, corticobasal degeneration and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Other areas of the brain that are associated with alien hand syndrome are the frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes.

==Signs and symptoms==
&quot;Alien behavior&quot; can be distinguished from reflexive behavior in that the former is flexibly purposive while the latter is obligatory. Sometimes the affected person will not be aware of what the alien hand is doing until it is brought to his or her attention, or until the hand does something that draws their attention to its behavior. There is a clear distinction between the behaviors of the two hands in which the affected hand is viewed as &quot;wayward&quot; and sometimes &quot;disobedient&quot; and generally out of the realm of their own voluntary control, while the unaffected hand is under normal volitional control. At times, particularly in individuals who have sustained damage to the corpus callosum that connects the two cerebral hemispheres , the hands appear to be acting in opposition to each other.

A related syndrome described by the French neurologist François Lhermitte involves the release through disinhibition of a tendency to compulsively utilize objects that present themselves in the surrounding environment around the patient. The behavior of the patient is, in a sense, obligatorily linked to the &quot;affordances&quot; (using terminology introduced by the American ecological psychologist, James J. Gibson) presented by objects that are located within the immediate peri-personal environment.

This condition is known as utilization behavior. It is most often associated with extensive bilateral frontal lobe damage and might actually be thought of as &quot;bilateral&quot; alien hand syndrome in which the patient is compulsively directed by external environmental contingencies (such as the presence of a hairbrush on the table in front of them elicits the act of brushing the hair) and has no capacity to &quot;hold back&quot; and inhibit pre-potent motor programs that are obligatorily linked to the presence of specific external objects in the peri-personal space of the patient. When the frontal lobe damage is bilateral and generally more extensive, the patient completely loses the ability to act in a self-directed manner and becomes totally dependent upon the surrounding environmental indicators to guide their behavior in a general social context, a condition referred to as &quot;environmental dependency syndrome&quot;.

To deal with the alien hand, some individuals engage in personification of the affected hand. Usually these names are negative in nature, from mild such as &quot;cheeky&quot; to malicious &quot;monster from the moon&quot;. For example, Rachelle Doody and Jankovic described a patient who named her alien hand &quot;baby Joseph&quot;. When the hand engaged in playful, troublesome activities such as pinching her nipples (akin to biting while nursing), she would experience amusement and would instruct baby Joseph to &quot;stop being naughty&quot;. Furthermore, Bogen suggested that certain personality characteristics, such as a flamboyant personality, contribute to frequent personification of the affected hand.

Neuroimaging and pathological research shows that lesions of the frontal lobe (in the frontal variant) and corpus callosum (in the callosal variant) are the most common anatomical lesions responsible for the alien hand syndrome. These areas are closely linked in terms of motor planning and its final pathways.

The callosal variant includes advanced willed motor acts by the non-dominant hand, where individuals frequently exhibit &quot;intermanual conflict&quot; in which one hand acts at cross-purposes with the other &quot;good hand&quot;. For example, one patient was observed putting a cigarette into her mouth with her intact, &quot;controlled&quot; hand (her right, dominant hand), following which her left hand rose, grasped the cigarette, pulled it out of her mouth, and toss it away before it could be lit by the right hand. The patient then surmised that &quot;I guess &#x27;he&#x27; doesn&#x27;t want me to smoke that cigarette.&quot; Another patient was observed to be buttoning up her blouse with her controlled dominant hand while the alien non-dominant hand, at the same time, was unbuttoning her blouse. The frontal variant most often affects the dominant hand, but can affect either hand depending on the lateralization of the damage to medial frontal cortex, and includes grasp reflex, impulsive groping toward objects or/and tonic grasping (in other words, difficulty in releasing grip).

In most cases, classic alien-hand signs derive from damage to the medial frontal cortex, accompanying damage to the corpus callosum. In these individuals, the main cause of damage is unilateral or bilateral infarction of cortex in the territory supplied by the anterior cerebral artery or associated arteries. Oxygenated blood is supplied by the anterior cerebral artery to most medial portions of the frontal lobes and to the anterior two-thirds of the corpus callosum, and infarction may consequently result in damage to multiple adjacent locations in the brain in the supplied territory. As the medial frontal lobe damage is often linked to lesions of the corpus callosum, frontal variant cases may also present with callosal form signs. Cases of damage restricted to the callosum however, tend not to show frontal alien-hand signs.

==Cause==
The common emerging factor in alien hand syndrome is that the primary motor cortex controlling hand movement is isolated from premotor cortex influences but remains generally intact in its ability to execute movements of the hand.

A 2009 fMRI study looking at the temporal sequence of activation of components of a cortical network associated with voluntary movement in normal individuals demonstrated &quot;an anterior-to-posterior temporal gradient of activity from supplemental motor area through premotor and motor cortices to the posterior parietal cortex&quot;. Therefore, with normal voluntary movement, the emergent sense of agency appears to be associated with an orderly sequence of activation that develops initially in the anteromedial frontal cortex in the vicinity of the supplementary motor complex on the medial surface of the frontal aspect of the hemisphere (including the supplementary motor area) &quot;prior&quot; to activation of the primary motor cortex in the pre-central gyrus on the lateral aspect of the hemisphere, when the hand movement is being generated. Activation of the primary motor cortex, presumed to be directly involved in the execution of the action via projections into the corticospinal component of the pyramidal tracts, is then followed by activation of the posterior parietal cortex, possibly related to the receipt of recurrent or &quot;re-afferent&quot; somatosensory feedback generated from the periphery by the movement which would normally interact with the efference copy transmitted from primary motor cortex to permit the movement to be recognized as self-generated rather than imposed by an external force. That is, the efference copy allows the recurrent afferent somatosensory flow from the periphery associated with the self-generated movement to be recognized as &quot;re-afference&quot; as distinct from &quot;ex-afference&quot;. Failure of this mechanism may lead to a failure to distinguish between self-generated and externally generated movement of the limb. This anomalous situation in which re-afference from a self-generated movement is mistakenly registered as ex-afference due to a failure to generate and successfully transmit an efference copy to sensory cortex, could readily lead to the interpretation that what is in actuality a self-generated movement has been produced by an external force as a result of the failure to develop a sense of agency in association with emergence of the self-generated movement (see below for a more detailed discussion).

A 2007 fMRI study examining the difference in functional brain activation patterns associated with alien as compared to non-alien &quot;volitional&quot; movement in a patient with alien hand syndrome found that alien movement involved anomalous &quot;isolated&quot; activation of the primary motor cortex in the damaged hemisphere contralateral to the alien hand, while non-alien movement involved the normal process of activation described in the preceding paragraph in which primary motor cortex in the intact hemisphere activates in concert with frontal premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex presumably involved in a normal cortical network generating premotor influences on the primary motor cortex along with immediate post-motor re-afferent activation of the posterior parietal cortex.

Combining these two fMRI studies, one could hypothesize that the alien behavior that is unaccompanied by a sense of agency emerges due to autonomous activity in the primary motor cortex acting independently of premotor cortex pre-activating influences that would normally be associated with the emergence of a sense of agency linked to the execution of the action.

As noted above, these ideas can also be linked to the concept of efference copy and &quot;re-afference&quot;, where efference copy is a signal postulated to be directed from premotor cortex (activated normally in the process associated with emergence of an internally generated movement) over to somatosensory cortex of the parietal region, in advance of the arrival of the &quot;re-afferent&quot; input generated from the moving limb, that is, the afferent return from the moving limb associated with the self-generated movement produced. It is generally thought that a movement is recognized as internally generated when the efference copy signal effectively &quot;cancels out&quot; the re-afference. The afferent return from the limb is effectively correlated with the efference copy signal so that the re-afference can be recognized as such and distinguished from &quot;ex-afference&quot;, which would be afferent return from the limb produced by an externally imposed force. When the efference copy is no longer normally generated, then the afferent return from the limb associated with the self-generated movement is mis-perceived as externally produced &quot;ex-afference&quot; since it is no longer correlated with or canceled out by the efference copy. As a result, the development of the sense that a movement is not internally generated even though it actually is (i.e. the failure of the sense of agency to emerge in conjunction with the movement), could indicate a failure of the generation of the efference copy signal associated with the normal premotor process through which the movement is prepared for execution.

Since there is no disturbance of the sense of ownership of the limb in this situation, and there is no apparent physical explanation for how the owned limb could be moving in a purposive manner without an associated sense of agency, a cognitive dissonance is created which may be resolved through the assumption that the goal-directed limb movement is being directed by an &quot;alien&quot; unidentifiable external force with the capacity for directing goal-directed actions of one&#x27;s own limb.

===Disconnection===
It is theorized that alien hand syndrome results when disconnection occurs between different parts of the brain that are engaged in different aspects of the control of bodily movement. As a result, different regions of the brain are able to command bodily movements, but cannot generate a conscious feeling of self-control over these movements. As a result, the sense of agency that is normally associated with voluntary movement is impaired or lost. There is a dissociation between the process associated with the actual execution of the physical movements of the limb and the process that produces an internal sense of voluntary control over the movements, with this latter process thus normally creating the internal conscious sensation that the movements are being internally initiated, controlled and produced by an active self.

Recent studies have examined the neural correlates of emergence of the sense of agency under normal circumstances. This appears to involve consistent congruence between what is being produced through efferent outflow to the musculature of the body, and what is being sensed as the presumed product in the periphery of this efferent command signal. In alien hand syndrome, the neural mechanisms involved in establishing that this congruence has occurred may be impaired. This may involve an abnormality in the brain mechanism that differentiates between &quot;re-afference&quot; (the return of kinesthetic sensation from the self-generated &quot;active&quot; limb movement) and &quot;ex-afference&quot; (kinesthetic sensation generated from an externally produced &#x27;passive&#x27; limb movement in which an active self does not participate). This brain mechanism is proposed to involve the production of a parallel &quot;efference copy&quot; signal that is sent directly to the somatic sensory regions and is transformed into a &quot;corollary discharge&quot;, an expected afferent signal from the periphery that would result from the performance driven by the issued efferent signal. The correlation of the corollary discharge signal with the actual afferent signal returned from the periphery can then be used to determine if, in fact, the intended action occurred as expected. When the sensed result of the action is congruent with the predicted result, then the action can be labelled as self-generated and associated with an emergent sense of agency.

If, however, the neural mechanisms involved in establishing this sensorimotor linkage associated with self-generated action are faulty, it would be expected that the sense of agency with action would not develop as discussed in the previous section.

===Loss of inhibitions===
One theory posed to explain these phenomena proposes that the brain has separable neural &quot;premotor&quot; or &quot;agency&quot; systems for managing the process of transforming intentions into overt action. An anteromedial frontal premotor system is engaged in the process of directing exploratory actions based on &quot;internal&quot; drive by releasing or reducing inhibitory control over such actions.

A 2011 paper reporting on neuronal unit recording in the medial frontal cortex in human subjects showed a clear pre-activation of neurons identified in this area up to several hundred milliseconds prior to the onset of an overt self-generated finger movement and the authors were able to develop a computational model whereby volition emerges once a change in internally generated firing rate of neuronal assemblies in this part of the brain crossed a threshold. Damage to this anteromedial premotor system produces disinhibition and release of such exploratory and object acquisition actions which then occur autonomously. A posterolateral temporo-parieto-occipital premotor system has a similar inhibitory control over actions that withdraw from environmental stimuli as well as the ability to excite actions that are contingent upon and driven by external stimulation, as distinct from internal drive. These two intrahemispheric systems, each of which activates an opposing cortical &quot;tropism&quot;, interact through mutual inhibition that maintains a dynamic balance between approaching toward (in other words, with &quot;intent-to-capture&quot; in which contact with and grasping onto the attended object is sought) versus withdrawing from (that is, with &quot;intent-to-escape&quot; in which distancing from the attended object is sought) environmental stimuli in the behavior of the contralateral limbs. Together, these two intrahemispheric agency systems form an integrated trans-hemispheric agency system.

When the anteromedial frontal &quot;escape&quot; system is damaged, involuntary but purposive movements of an exploratory reach-and-grasp naturewhat Denny-Brown referred to as a &quot;positive&quot; cortical tropismare released in the contralateral limb. This is referred to as a &quot;positive&quot; cortical tropism because eliciting sensory stimuli, such as would result from tactile contact on the volar aspect of the fingers and palm of the hand, are linked to the activation of movement that increases or enhances the eliciting stimulation through a positive feedback connection (see discussion above in section entitled &quot;Parietal and Occipital Lobes&quot;).

When the posterolateral parieto-occipital &quot;approach&quot; system is damaged, involuntary purposive movements of a release-and-retract nature, such as levitation and instinctive avoidance – what Denny-Brown referred to as a &quot;negative&quot; cortical tropism – are released in the contralateral limb. This is referred to as a &quot;negative&quot; cortical tropism because eliciting sensory stimuli, such as would result from tactile contact on the volar aspect of the fingers and palm of the hand, are linked to the activation of movement that reduces or eliminates the eliciting stimulation through a negative feedback connection (see discussion above in section entitled &quot;Parietal and Occipital Lobes&quot;).

Each intrahemispheric agency system has the potential capability of acting autonomously in its control over the contralateral limb although unitary integrative control of the two hands is maintained through interhemispheric communication between these systems via the projections traversing the corpus callosum at the cortical level and other interhemispheric commissures linking the two hemispheres at the subcortical level.

===Disconnection of hemispheres due to injury===
One major difference between the two hemispheres is the direct connection between the agency system of the dominant hemisphere and the encoding system based primarily in the dominant hemisphere that links action to its production and through to its interpretation with language and language-encoded thought. It is proposed that while relational action in the form of embodied inter-subjective behavior precedes linguistic capacity during infant development, a process ensues through the course of development through which linguistic constructs are linked to action elements in order to produce a language-based encoding of action-oriented knowledge.

When there is a major disconnection between the two hemispheres resulting from callosal injury, the language-linked dominant hemisphere agent which maintains its primary control over the dominant limb loses, to some degree, its direct and linked control over the separate &quot;agent&quot; based in the nondominant hemisphere, and the nondominant limb, which had been previously responsive and &quot;obedient&quot; to the dominant conscious agent. The possibility of purposeful action occurring outside of the realm of influence of the conscious dominant agent can occur and the basic assumption that both hands are controlled through and subject to the dominant agent is proven incorrect. The sense of agency that would normally arise from movement of the nondominant limb now no longer develops, or, at least, is no longer accessible to consciousness. A new explanatory narrative for understanding the situation in which the now inaccessible nondominant hemisphere based agent is capable of activating the nondominant limb is necessitated.

Under such circumstances, the two separated agents can control simultaneous actions in the two limbs that are directed at opposing purposes although the dominant hand remains linked to the dominant consciously accessible language-linked agent and is viewed as continuing to be under &quot;conscious control&quot; and obedient to conscious will and intent as accessible through thought, while the nondominant hand, directed by an essentially non-verbal agent whose intent can only be inferred by the dominant agent after the fact, is no longer &quot;tied in&quot; and subject to the dominant agent and is thus identified by the conscious language-based dominant agent as having a separate and inaccessible alien agency and associated existence. This theory would explain the emergence of alien behavior in the nondominant limb and intermanual conflict between the two limbs in the presence of damage to the corpus callosum.

The distinct anteromedial, frontal, and posterolateral temporo-parieto-occipital variants of the alien hand syndrome would be explained by selective injury to either the frontal or the posterior components of the agency systems within a particular hemisphere, with the relevant and specific form of alien behavior developing in the limb contralateral to the damaged hemisphere.

==Diagnosis==

===Corpus callosum===
Damage to the corpus callosum can give rise to &quot;purposeful&quot; actions in the person&#x27;s non-dominant hand (an individual who is left-hemisphere-dominant will experience the left hand becoming alien, and the right hand will turn alien in the person with right-hemisphere dominance).

In &quot;the callosal variant&quot;, the patient&#x27;s hand counteracts voluntary actions performed by the other, &quot;good&quot; hand. Two phenomena that are often found in individuals with callosal alien hand are &quot;agonistic dyspraxia&quot; and &quot;diagonistic dyspraxia&quot;.

Agonistic dyspraxia involves compulsive automatic execution of motor commands by one hand when the patient is asked to perform movements with the other hand. For example, when a patient with callosal damage was instructed to pull a chair forward, the affected hand would decisively and impulsively push the chair backwards.
Agonistic dyspraxia can thus be viewed as an involuntary competitive interaction between the two hands directed toward completion of a desired act in which the affected hand competes with the unaffected hand to complete a purposive act originally intended to be performed by the unaffected hand.

Diagonistic dyspraxia, on the other hand, involves a conflict between the desired act in which the unaffected hand has been engaged and the interfering action of the affected hand which works to oppose the purpose of the desired act intended to be performed by the unaffected hand. For instance, when Akelaitis&#x27;s individuals underwent surgery to the corpus callosum to reduce epileptic seizures, one patient&#x27;s left alien hand would frequently interfere with the right hand. For instance, while trying to turn over to the next page with the right hand, his left hand would try to close the book.

In another case of callosal alien hand, the patient did not have intermanual conflict between the hands but rather from a symptom characterized by involuntary mirror movements of the affected hand. When the patient was asked to perform movements with one hand, the other hand would involuntarily perform a mirror image movement which continued even when the involuntary movement was brought to the attention of the patient, and the patient was asked to restrain the mirrored movement. The patient had a ruptured aneurysm near the anterior cerebral artery, which resulted in the right hand being mirrored by the left hand. The patient described the left hand as frequently interfering and taking over anything the patient tried to do with the right hand. For instance, when trying to grasp a glass of water with the right hand with a right side approach, the left hand would involuntary reach out and grasp hold of the glass through a left side approach.

More recently, Geschwind et al. described the case of a woman with severe coronary heart disease. One week after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, she noticed that her left hand started to &quot;live a life of its own&quot;. It would unbutton her gown, try to choke her while asleep and would automatically fight with the right hand to answer the phone. She had to physically restrain the affected hand with the right hand to prevent injury, a behavior which has been termed &quot;self-restriction&quot;. The left hand also showed signs of severe ideomotor apraxia. It was able to mimic actions but only with the help of mirror movements executed by the right hand (enabling synkinesis). Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Geschwind et al. found damage to the posterior half of the callosal body, sparing the anterior half and the splenium extending slightly into the white matter underlying the right cingulate cortex.

Park et al. also described two cases of infarction as the origin of alien hand symptoms. Both individuals had had infarction of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). One individual, a 72-year-old male, had difficulty controlling his hands, as they often moved involuntarily, despite his trying to stabilize them. Furthermore, he often could not let go of objects after grasping them with his palms. The other individual, a 47-year-old female with an ACA in a different location of the artery, complained that her left hand would move on its own and she could not control its movements. Her left hand could also sense when her right hand was holding an object and would involuntarily, forcibly take the object out of her right hand.

===Frontal lobe===
Unilateral injury to the medial aspect of the brain&#x27;s frontal lobe can trigger reaching, grasping and other purposeful movements in the contralateral hand. With anteromedial frontal lobe injuries, these movements are often exploratory reaching movements in which external objects are frequently grasped and utilized functionally, without the simultaneous perception on the part of the patient that they are &quot;in control&quot; of these movements. Once an object has been acquired and is maintained in the grasp of this &quot;frontal variant&quot; form of alien hand, the patient often has difficulty with voluntarily releasing the object from grasp and can sometimes be seen to be peeling the fingers of the hand back off the grasped object using the opposite controlled hand to enable the release of the grasped object (also referred to as tonic grasping or the &quot;instinctive grasp reaction&quot;). Some (for example, the neurologist Derek Denny-Brown) have referred to this behavior as &quot;magnetic apraxia&quot;

Goldberg and Bloom described a woman with a large cerebral infarction of the medial surface of the left frontal lobe in the territory of the left anterior cerebral artery which left her with the frontal variant of the alien hand involving the right hand. There were no signs of callosal disconnection nor was there evidence of any callosal damage. The patient displayed frequent grasp reflexes; her right hand would reach out and grab objects without releasing them. In regards to tonic grasping, the more the patient tried to let go of the object, the more the grip of the object tightened. With focused effort the patient was able to let go of the object, but if distracted, the behaviour would re-commence. The patient could also forcibly release the grasped object by peeling her fingers away from contact with the object using the intact left hand. Additionally, the hand would scratch at the patient&#x27;s leg to the extent that an orthotic device was required to prevent injury. Another patient reported not only tonic grasping towards objects nearby, but the alien hand would take hold of the patient&#x27;s penis and engage in public masturbation.

===Parietal and occipital lobes===
A distinct &quot;posterior variant&quot; form of alien hand syndrome is associated with damage to the posterolateral parietal lobe and/or occipital lobe of the brain. The movements in this situation tend to be more likely to withdraw the palmar surface of the hand away from sustained environmental contact rather than reaching out to grasp onto objects to produce palmar tactile stimulation, as is most often seen in the frontal form of the condition. In the frontal variant, tactile contact on the ventral surface of the palm and fingers facilitates finger flexion and grasp of the object through a positive feedback loop (i.e. the stimulus generates movement that reinforces, strengthens and sustains the triggering stimulation).

In contrast, in the posterior variant, tactile contact on the ventral surface of the palm and fingers is actively avoided through facilitation of extension of the fingers and withdrawal of the palm in a negative feedback loop (i.e. the stimulus, and even anticipation of stimulation of the palmar surface of the hand, generates movement of the palm and fingers that reduces and effectively counteracts and eliminates the triggering stimulation, or, in the case of anticipated palmar contact, decreases the likelihood of such contact). Alien movements in the posterior variant of the syndrome also tend to be less coordinated and show a coarse ataxic motion during active movement that is generally not observed in the frontal form of the condition. This is generally thought to be due to an optic form of ataxia since it is facilitated by the visual presence of an object with visual attention directed toward the object. The apparent instability could be due to an unstable interaction between the tactile avoidance tendency biasing toward withdrawal from the object, and the visually based acquisition bias tendency pushing toward an approach to the object.

The alien limb in the posterior variant of the syndrome may be seen to &quot;levitate&quot; upward into the air withdrawing away from contact surfaces through the activation of anti-gravity musculature. Alien hand movement in the posterior variant may show a typical posture, sometimes referred to as a &quot;parietal hand&quot; or the &quot;instinctive avoidance reaction&quot; (a term introduced by neurologist Derek Denny-Brown as an inverse form of the &quot;magnetic apraxia&quot; seen in the frontal variant, as noted above), in which the digits move into a highly extended position with active extension of the interphalangeal joints of the digits and hyper-extension of the metacarpophalangeal joints, and the palmar surface of the hand is actively pulled back away from approaching objects or up and away from supporting surfaces. The &quot;alien&quot; movements, however, remain purposeful and goal-directed, a point which clearly differentiates these movements from other disorganized non-purposeful forms of involuntary limb movement (e.g. athetosis, chorea, or myoclonus).

===Similarities between frontal and posterior variants===
In both the frontal and the posterior variants of the alien hand syndrome, the patient&#x27;s reactions to the limb&#x27;s apparent capability to perform goal-directed actions independent of conscious volition is similar. In both of these variants of alien hand syndrome, the alien hand emerges in the hand contralateral to the damaged hemisphere.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for the alien hand syndrome. However, the symptoms can be reduced and managed to some degree by keeping the alien hand occupied and involved in a task, for example by giving it an object to hold in its grasp. Specific learned tasks can restore voluntary control of the hand to a significant degree. One patient with the &quot;frontal&quot; form of alien hand who would reach out to grasp onto different objects (e.g., door handles) as he was walking was given a cane to hold in the alien hand while walking, even though he really did not need a cane for its usual purpose. With the cane firmly in the grasp of the alien hand, it would generally not release the grasp and drop the cane in order to reach out to grasp onto a different object. Other techniques proven to be effective include; wedging the hand between the legs or slapping it; warm water application and visual or tactile contact. Additionally, Wu et al. found that an irritating alarm activated by biofeedback reduced the time the alien hand held an object.

In the presence of unilateral damage to a single cerebral hemisphere, there is generally a gradual reduction in the frequency of alien behaviors observed over time and a gradual restoration of voluntary control over the affected hand. Actually, when AHS originates from focal injury of acute onset, recovery usually occurs within a year. One theory is that neuroplasticity in the bihemispheric and subcortical brain systems involved in voluntary movement production can serve to re-establish the connection between the executive production process and the internal self-generation and registration process. Exactly how this may occur is not well understood, but a process of gradual recovery from alien hand syndrome when the damage is confined to a single cerebral hemisphere has been reported. In some instances, individuals may resort to constraining the wayward, undesirable and sometimes embarrassing actions of the impaired hand by voluntarily grasping onto the forearm of the impaired hand using the intact hand. This observed behavior has been termed &quot;self-restriction&quot; or &quot;self-grasping&quot;.

In another approach, the patient is trained to perform a specific task, such as moving the alien hand to contact a specific object or a highly salient environmental target, which is a movement that the patient can learn to generate voluntarily through focused training in order to effectively override the alien behavior. It is possible that some of this training produces a re-organization of premotor systems within the damaged hemisphere, or, alternatively, that ipsilateral control of the limb from the intact hemisphere may be expanded.

Another method involves simultaneously &quot;muffling&quot; the action of the alien hand and limiting the sensory feedback coming back to the hand from environmental contact by placing it in a restrictive &quot;cloak&quot; such as a specialized soft foam hand orthosis or, alternatively, an everyday oven mitt. Other individuals have reported using an orthotic device to restrict perseverative grasping or restraining the alien hand by securing it to the bed pole. Of course, this can limit the degree to which the hand can participate in addressing functional goals for the patient and may be considered to be an unjustifiable restraint.

Theoretically, this approach could slow down the process through which voluntary control of the hand is restored if the neuroplasticity that underlies recovery involves the recurrent exercise of voluntary will to control the actions of the hand in a functional context and the associated experiential reinforcement through successful willful suppression of the alien behavior.

== History ==
The first known case described in the medical literature appeared in a detailed case report published in German in 1908 by the preeminent German neuro-psychiatrist, Kurt Goldstein. In this paper, Goldstein described a right-handed woman who had had a stroke affecting her left side from which she had partially recovered by the time she was seen. However, her left arm seemed as though it belonged to another person and performed actions that appeared to occur independent of her will.

The patient complained of a feeling of &quot;strangeness&quot; in relationship to the goal-directed movements of the left hand and insisted that &quot;someone else&quot; was moving the left hand, and that she was not moving it herself. When the left hand grasped an object, she could not voluntarily release it. The senses of touch and proprioception of the left side were impaired. The left hand would make spontaneous movements, such as wiping the face or rubbing the eyes, but these were relatively infrequent. With significant effort, she was able to move her left arm in response to spoken command, but conscious movements were slower or less precise than similar involuntary motions.

Goldstein developed a &quot;doctrine of motor apraxia&quot; in which he discussed the generation of voluntary action and proposed a brain structure for temporal and spatial cognition, will and other higher cognitive processes. Goldstein maintained that a structure conceptually organizing both the body and external space was necessary for object perception as well as for voluntary action on external objects.

In his classic papers reviewing the wide variety of disconnection syndromes associated with focal brain pathology, Norman Geschwind commented that Kurt Goldstein &quot;was perhaps the first to stress the non-unity of the personality in individuals with callosal section, and its possible psychiatric effects&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* In Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, the eponymous character, played by Peter Sellers, apparently has alien hand syndrome, as he cannot stop himself from doing the Nazi salute. &quot;Dr. Strangelove syndrome&quot; was suggested as the official name for AHS. This was not approved, though it is sometimes used as an alternative name.
* In the medical drama TV series &quot;House&quot; episode &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, a patient has alien hand syndrome.
* An episode of &quot;Dark Matters: Twisted But True&quot;a documentary TV series on Discovery Sciencedescribed alien hand syndrome and traced its history.
* The 2017 Indian Tamil dark comedy film &quot;Peechankai&quot; is about a person with AHS.
* In Season 2 of the TV series &quot;Scream Queens&quot;, Dr. Brock Holt appears to have alien hand syndrome.
* In the Brazilian soap opera &quot;A Dona do Pedaço&quot; (2019), the character Eusébio, played by Marco Nanini, began to suffer from a &quot;supernatural phenomenon&quot; similar to AHS.
* In Season 7 of the TV series 9-1-1, LAFD Station 118 respond to a patient with AHS.

<text>Pyromancy (Ancient Greek ἐμπυρία (empyria), &quot;divination by fire&quot;) is the art of divination by means of fire or flames.

The word &quot;pyromancy&quot; is adapted from the Greek word &quot;pyromanteia&quot;, from pyr (πῦρ, &quot;fire)&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;manteia&quot; (μαντεία, &quot;divination by means of&quot;). Its first known use was in the 1300s, and it evolved into the Late Latin word &quot;piromantia&quot; and Old French word &quot;piromance.&quot;

==History of pyromancy==
Due to the importance of fire in society in prehistory and its continued importance within civilizations, it is quite likely that pyromancy was one of the earlier forms of divination, arising independently in many civilizations around the world. 

In much of Western culture, fire was often associated with a god, or was revered as a god itself. Fire was associated with a living being (because it ate, breathed, grew, decayed, and died) in both Western and non-Western religions. Fire was so basic to the human experience that it has persisted in the minds of humanity as an element close to nature.

The eternal fire at Nymphaion in southern Illyria (present-day Albania) also functioned as an oracle. The forms of divination practiced in this natural fire sanctuary with peculiar physical properties were widely known to the ancient Greek and Roman authors.

Fire rituals in Mesopotamia and Eurasia were thought to originate with ancient Zoroastrian rituals around the use of fire in temples and on altars. Ancient Zoroastrians believed fire to have been “the most holy spirit” from which all life was born, and fire was used as a central icon in many Zoroastrian rituals.

In the Old Testament, fire was often associated with divine intervention; with the burning bush guiding the decision of Moses, and the pillar of fire guiding the Israelites in the wilderness. Even the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah was accomplished through divine retribution.

Greek legends of the origins of fire speaks to the importance of fire to separate humans from animals. To many ancient Greeks, fire was a godly element that was bestowed by higher forces, having been given to humans by the Titan Prometheus. It is said that in Greek society, virgins at the Temple of Athena in Athens regularly practiced pyromancy. It is also likely that the followers of Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire and the forge, practiced pyromancy.

In Renaissance magic, pyromancy was classified as one of the seven &quot;forbidden arts&quot;, along with necromancy, geomancy, aeromancy, hydromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and scapulimancy.

Fire rituals in East Asia most often revolved around animal bones. In ancient China, Japan, and Tibet, bones from animal scapula (the shoulder bone) would be thrown into fires, and the cracks would be interpreted to divine the future. This made up an important part of the culture of ancient China, with these bones later being referred to as oracle bones. In Japan, turtle shells would also be used as a ritualistic divination technique. In Tibet, such divination was used to understand natural phenomena that was otherwise inexplicable to villagers. Lamps that use animal fat were often burned by ancient Tibetan peoples, and the smoke and flames thereof were interpreted as the guidance of natural forces.

==Types of pyromancy==
The most basic form of pyromancy is that in which the diviner observes flames, from a sacrificial fire, a candle, or another source of flame, and interprets the shapes that he or she sees within them. However, there are several variations of pyromancy, some of which are as follows: 

*Alomancy: divination by salt, one type of which involves casting salt into a fire
*Botanomancy: divination by burning plants
*Capnomancy: divination by smoke; light, thin smoke that rose straight up was a good omen; otherwise, a bad one.
*Causinomancy: divination by burning (non-specific as to the object burned)
*Daphnomancy (also called empyromancy): divination by burning laurel leaves
*Osteomancy: divination using bones, one type of which involves heating to produce cracks
*Plastromancy: divination using turtle plastrons; in China, this was done by heating pits carved into them.
*Scapulimancy: divination by scapulae; in Asia and North America, this was done through pyromancy.
*Sideromancy: divination by burning straw with an iron.

<doc id="263805" wikidata="Q7366701" url="?curid=263805" title="Ropata Wahawaha">
<text>Ropata Wahawaha ( – 1 July 1897) was a Māori military leader and &quot;rangatira&quot; (chief) of the Ngāti Porou &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) who rose to prominence during New Zealand&#x27;s East Cape War and Te Kooti&#x27;s War.

Born in 1820 in the Waiapu Valley on the East Cape, he was enslaved as a boy and became known as Rāpata Wahawaha. He later obtained his freedom and as an adult, became known as Ropata. In 1865, he fought against the Pai Mārire religious movement when it expanded into the East Cape area. During the conflict, he became &quot;rangatira&quot; of Te Aowera, a &quot;hapū&quot; (subtribe) of Ngāti Porou. As a &quot;Kūpapa&quot;, a Māori allied to the New Zealand Government, he fought alongside the Volunteer Force, New Zealand&#x27;s militia, and led war parties against the Pai Mārire and their presence in the East Cape region was largely eliminated by mid-1866.

From 1868 to 1871, he commanded Ngāti Porou war parties in the pursuit of Te Kooti, a rebel Māori leader whose religious movement, Ringatū, threatened the security of the East Cape region. During the conflict he played a key role in the capture of Te Kooti&#x27;s &quot;pā&quot; (hill fort) at Ngatapa, for which he was awarded the New Zealand Cross and was made a major in the Volunteer Force. His pursuit of Te Kooti was motivated by a desire to ensure that Ngāti Porou land was not subject to seizure by the Government. In his later years, he commanded the militia in the Ngāti Porou district, was a land agent and a member of the Legislative Council.

==Early life==
Rāpata Wahawaha was born about 1820 either in Te Puia Springs or Akuaku, in the Waiapu Valley on the East Cape. He was the son of Hīpora Koroua and Te Hapamana Te Whao. He was of the Te Aowera &quot;hapū&quot; (sub-tribe) of the Ngāti Porou &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe), one of the major Māori iwi in the eastern regions of the North Island of New Zealand.

As a child Ropata was captured by the Rongowhakaata &quot;iwi&quot; during a conflict with Ngāti Porou over disputed land. He became the slave of Rāpata Whakapuhia whose name he perforce adopted. However, in later years when he rose to prominence he worked closely with Donald McLean who, having a broad Scottish accent, habitually pronounced his name as &quot;Ropata&quot; and it became the name by which he is generally known. He preferred this as it disassociated him from the period of life when he was a slave. By 1839 Ropata had gained his freedom and was living with the Ngāti Porou. He was married to Harata Te Ihi whose nephew, Paratene Ngata, was raised in their household.

==East Cape War==
Little is known of Ropata&#x27;s life following his marriage until 1865, when the East Cape War broke out. Ngāti Porou had become divided following the arrival on the East Cape that year of the leaders of the Pai Mārire religious movement. The religion espoused its followers, known as Hauhau, immunity to bullets and sought to move &quot;pākehā&quot; (European New Zealanders) off Maori land. It also advocated for the Kingites. Some of the &quot;hapū&quot; of Ngāti Porou converted to the new religion while others opposed it.

Owing to the work of missionaries in the area since the 1830s, many Ngāti Porou, including Ropata&#x27;s &quot;hapū&quot;, had a strong Christian faith. They were angered by the murder of Carl Völkner by the Hauhau in early 1865. Furthermore, they realised that alignment with Pai Mārire would lead to conflict with the New Zealand Government, and a risk of confiscation of their land, as had happened elsewhere in the country.

===Waiapu Valley campaign===

Ropata himself was staunchly Anglican, and was a founding member of the diocese of Waiapu. On 5 June, he was among a number of Te Aowera attending celebrations for the establishment of a church at Popoti, when they were advised that some Hauhau had arrived in the Waiapu Valley. In response to pleas by a Ngāti Porou leader, he gathered a party of 40 men, mainly from his own &quot;hapū&quot; of Te Aowera. His party was poorly equipped, with only a few flintlock muskets among them, and traditional weapons such as &quot;mere&quot; (club) and &quot;taiaha&quot; (staff). In contrast, the Hauhau were armed with modern rifles. On 20 June Ropata led an attack on the Hauhau, who had established a &quot;pā&quot; (hill fort) at Mangaone. Although the Te Aowera were defeated, Ropata gained some notoriety when, in single combat, he killed a Hauhau leader. The &quot;rangatira&quot; (chief) of the Te Aowera was killed in the engagement and Ropata succeeded him as the leader of his &quot;hapū&quot;. He suffered another defeat two days later when his party was driven off during an attack of the Hauhau&#x27;s pā at Pukemaire. In addition, their own &quot;pā&quot; at Tikitiki was captured.

When the Hauhau arrived in Waiapu Valley, Mōkena Kōhere, a senior &quot;rangatira&quot; of Ngāti Porou, had appealed to Donald McLean, the superintendent for the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Province, for assistance. Much needed supplies were subsequently sent along with one hundred militia, who arrived at Te Hatepe &quot;pā&quot;, to where Ropata and his party had withdrawn. His force now numbered around 85, following the arrival of Te Aowera reinforcements. The arrival of personnel of the Volunteer Force, New Zealand&#x27;s militia, on 13 July further boosted numbers. This proved timely for the Hauhau attacked the next day and were driven off.

Further defeats followed for the Hauhau, thanks to the intervention of the militia, but Ropata also played key roles in the fighting; He staged a successful ambush of Hauhau forces in late July and, equipped with modern weapons, later carried out campaigns alongside Henare Potae, another &quot;rangatira&quot; of Ngāti Porou, towards Tokomaru Bay and Tolaga Bay, seizing Hauhau &quot;pā&quot;. By this time, he had established himself as a respected warrior and &quot;rangatira&quot; among Ngāti Porou. He was also regarded as ruthless: according to an account written in 1879 by Walter Gudgeon, at one point Ropata found some men from his own &quot;hapū&quot;, Te Aowera, among a group of Hauhau prisoners and he personally shot each one. Monty Soutar, a Ngāti Porou historian, disputes this, writing in 2000 that no evidence in contemporary records could be found to support this action occurred.

On 3 October, in conjunction with over 100 militia, Ropata&#x27;s war party of 120 commenced a siege of the Pai Mārire stronghold of Pukemaire &quot;pā&quot;. Ropata, with a group of 12 warriors, dug a sap leading up to the palisade of the &quot;pā&quot; and pulled it down to gain entry. Although they had to withdraw, and poor weather delayed a renewed attack, the Hauhau abandoned Pukemaire a few days later and retreated to Hungahungatoroa. Ropata, with a group of his men, harried the Hauhau as they withdrew. On 13 October, they attacked Hungahungatoroa with Ropata part of a group sent to a ridge, overlooking the &quot;pā&quot;, to snipe at the Hauhau. At the suggestion of Mōkena Kōhere, negotiations commenced with defenders and the Ngāti Porou among them surrendered after receiving guarantees of their safety. The remainder, about 60, escaped out the rear of the &quot;pā&quot;. One, a senior leader of the Hauhau, was taken captive by Ropata; a colonial militia officer, upon discovering the identity of the prisoner, executed him. The action at Hungahungatoroa eliminated the last of the Hauhau strongholds in the Waiapu Valley. Some Ngāti Porou were allowed to return to their &quot;hapū&quot; after swearing allegiance to the Crown while others were sent to the Chatham Islands.

===Shift to the Poverty Bay===
There was still a Hauhau presence in Poverty Bay, to the south of the Waiapu Valley, centred on Waerenga-a-hika, a &quot;pā&quot; manned by around 400 to 500 Hauhau. The militia, despite being reinforced with troops brought in from Napier, only numbered 150 or so, inadequate to attack the &quot;pā&quot;. McLean sought Ropata&#x27;s assistance to deal with the threat. He eagerly complied; many of the Hauhau in Poverty Bay were of the Rongowhakaata &quot;iwi&quot;, which had enslaved him as a child. Ropata gathered a Ngāti Porou war party of 300 warriors and joined the militia in what amounted to a seven-day siege on Waerenga-a-hika that commenced in mid-November. After an attempted breakout, the Hauhau were defeated and the survivors taken as prisoners to the Chatham Islands.

Ropata continued to lead his war party south, this time in assistance of the Ngāti Kahungunu &quot;iwi&quot;, which was aligned with the Government. In January 1866, he and 150 Ngāti Porou landed at Wairoa. Together with 150 militia and 250 warriors from Ngāti Kahungunu &quot;iwi&quot;, they pushed towards Lake Waikaremoana in pursuit of the Hauhau. When the force was ambushed on 12 January and its lead elements began to fall back, Ropata helped restore morale, moving forward and setting fire to the undergrowth which obscured the vision of the Hauhau. Unable to see in the face of the advancing Ropata and his men, they withdrew. Closely pursued, around 25 to 35 were killed and several others taken prisoner. The losses of Ngāti Kahungunu and Porou amounted to 14 killed, one being Ropata&#x27;s uncle, mostly in the initial ambush. Few militia were involved in this engagement but one later recorded that Ropata executed four leaders of the Hauhau that were among the prisoners. He had initially proposed to spare those of Ngāti Kahungunu but this was not acceptable to that tribe&#x27;s &quot;rangatira&quot; who wished to make an example for the rest of their &quot;iwi&quot;. The Government forces and their allies then returned to Wairoa. There was further engagements with the remaining Hauhau over the next few months, but these involved Ngāti Kahungunu. By the middle of the year, the Hauhau threat to the East Cape had largely been eliminated.

==Te Kooti&#x27;s War==
In July 1868, Ropata was called upon again by the Government to help deal with a new threat. This was Te Kooti, of Ngāti Maru, a &quot;hapū&quot; of Rongowhakaata &quot;iwi&quot;, who had recently escaped from captivity in the Chatham Islands. Te Kooti had been sent there when he was arrested in March 1866 as a spy during the campaign against the Hauhau in Poverty Bay. While on the Chathams, he had become a religious leader among the numerous exiled Hauhau, espousing his own faith, Ringatū, based upon the Bible. After two years, the prisoners had become frustrated at their treatment, having been held without trial, and Te Kooti led them in surprising their guards and seizing a vessel to sail back to New Zealand.

Te Kooti and his followers made landfall near Poverty Bay on 9 July 1868 and made their way inland shortly afterwards. The local militia commander, Captain Biggs, ordered some of his men in pursuit after an initial attempt by a local &quot;rangatira&quot; to negotiate with Te Kooti was rejected. The militia were defeated in an encounter on 20 July, and there would be further unsuccessful skirmishes with Te Kooti&#x27;s men over the next several weeks. Te Kooti&#x27;s ranks soon swelled with converts from among the Māori of the region, who in their fervour, murdered some Ngāti Kahungunu &quot;rangatira&quot;. In response, in late October, Ropata and his Ngāti Porou were brought in.

===Ngatapa===
Te Kooti, after mounting a raid on 10 November that saw a number of Māori and European settlers and farmers murdered, retreated to a strong defensive &quot;pā&quot; at Ngatapa. Ropata and his men, at Wairoa, went north to Gisborne (known at the time as Tūranga) and onto Ngatapa. The &quot;pa&quot; contained about 200 Ringatū warriors and around 300 other Māori, many of whom were prisoners taken in Te Kooti&#x27;s raids. The first assault on 4 December, led by Ropata, Hōtene Porourangi, another &quot;rangatira&quot; of Ngāti Porou, and Lieutenants Mair and Preece of the Armed Constabulary, was unsuccessful. The &quot;pā&quot; was up on the peak of a ridge, and had strong fortifications including entrenchments and was palisaded. Although Ropata led a party in capturing a defensive trench, it had to be abandoned in the evening when they ran out of ammunition. Ropata pulled his men, tired by the march from Wairoa and the subsequent fighting, back to Tūranga. Despite this Ropata was awarded the New Zealand Cross (NZC) for his bravery and leading role in this action. The NZC had recently been established as a gallantry award for colonial personnel, and was regarded as being equivalent to a Victoria Cross (VC); those serving in New Zealand&#x27;s colonial militia were ineligible for the VC unless they were under the command of British officers. Ropata was also made a major in the Armed Constabulary. 

In early December, Colonel George Whitmore, commandant of the Armed Constabulary, arrived at Tūranga with 350 reinforcements for the local militia. They proceeded to Ngatapa after receiving reports that Te Kooti was still in the area and had not retreated to the Urewera country as first thought. In the meantime, Ropata had briefly returned to the East Cape to bring in more Ngāti Porou reinforcements and returned on 26 December with 300 men. Whitmore now had nearly 700 men, including 370 Ngāti Porou and 60 warriors of Te Arawa &quot;iwi&quot;, from the Bay of Plenty, under his command for an attack on Ngatapa. A tight cordon was thrown around the &quot;pā&quot; on 30 December, cutting off its water supply, and a siege commenced. An assault on 4 January 1869 breached the outer defences. This forced Te Kooti to evacuate the &quot;pā&quot; at dawn the next day, descending down steep, unguarded bluffs. Many of the escapees were captured by pursuing Ngāti Porou and Te Arawa. Around 136 of the Ringatū followers were killed, either during the siege itself or executed afterwards on the orders of Ropata. Te Kooti himself escaped and made his way to the Urewera country. Whitmore&#x27;s force lost 11 men killed and eight wounded. Afterwards, he was effusive in his praise of Ropata&#x27;s leadership and fighting skills. Indeed, it was Whitmore who had recommended Ropata for the NZC.

Whitmore sought Ropata&#x27;s assistance for a campaign against Titokowaru, another rebel chief, in the Wanganui area, on the opposite coast of the North Island. Ropata declined to join; he, along with Donald McLean and Karaitiana Takamoana, the Ngāti Kahungunu &quot;rangatira&quot;, felt that Te Kooti remained a threat to the East Cape region and did not want to see the area and his people defenceless. The Minister of Colonial Defence, Theodore Haultain, and the Prime Minister, Edward Stafford, both felt that McLean, who did not like Whitmore, influenced Ropata&#x27;s decision. When Whitmore found that Ropata and his men were unavailable, he expressed regret, considering them &quot;the bravest &quot;hapu&quot; of the best bush tribe in New Zealand&quot;. Some within Ngāti Porou were critical of Ropata&#x27;s decision and proceeded to join Whitmore in his campaign.

===Urewera country===

The Urewera country, to the west of East Cape, was rugged, mountainous terrain, and thickly forested, the home of the Ngāi Tūhoe &quot;iwi&quot;. The Government had alienated Tūhoe with confiscation of its most valuable land. Te Kooti and around 30 acolytes soon gathered followers from among Tūhoe and mounted raids on Ohiwa and Whakatane for supplies and weapons. His actions during these and later raids were particularly ruthless, and drew the ire of the &quot;iwi&quot; and &quot;hapū&quot; surrounding the Urewera country and encouraged them to support the Government. Whitmore mounted an invasion of the Urewera country in early May, inflicting many casualties on the Tūhoe and destroying their homes and cultivated lands. Ngāti Porou warriors were slow to become involved in Whitmore&#x27;s invasion of the Urewera country, only joining an expedition at Lake Waikaremoana in late May and that was withdrawn the following month after Te Kooti moved to the Taupo plains.

In early 1870, the Government decided to withdraw all pākeha militia from the pursuit of Te Kooti, and entrust the hunt for him to kūpapa (Māori allied to the Government): the Ngāti Porou, under Ropata, and Maori from the Whanganui, under Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui. The Te Arawa &quot;iwi&quot; would also be involved in the hunt for Te Kooti. Ropata was to command an East Cape invasion force, and manage its military operations. This was at the instigation of McLean, now the Minister of Defence, who had noted the success achieved by the kūpapa in the hunt for Te Kooti compared to the Armed Constabulary. Additional motivation was provided by a bounty of £5,000 for the capture of Te Kooti. Only one &quot;pākeha&quot; was allowed to accompany each of the Māori war parties; Ropata asked for and got Captain Thomas Porter, an officer of the Voluntary Cavalry in Poverty Bay. The East Cape party departed for the Urewera country on 28 February, numbering about 370 men. In his later writings, Porter commented favourably on Ropata&#x27;s leadership and the resulting discipline and loyalty he instilled in his Ngāti Porou during the march to Maungapohatu, a key site for the Tūhoe. They captured the &quot;pa&quot; there, which had never before been attacked, with the loss of only one man. Then, in late March Te Keepa and Ropata managed to catch Te Kooti between their two forces at his &quot;pā&quot; at Maraetahi. In the ensuing battle the Ringatū force was destroyed. Te Kooti escaped but most of his men were either captured or killed.

Despite Te Kooti evading capture, he was now largely a spent force. McLean was pleased with the result and rewarded Ngāti Porou by announcing the withdrawal of the Government&#x27;s claim to disputed land on the East Cape. This prompted Ropata to raise another contingent of Ngāti Porou to pursue Te Kooti; Crosby notes his motivation was likely to ensure that McLean kept his word. He left Tūranga on 4 May with nearly 440 men, aiming to capture Ngāti Kowhatu, near the Mangaaruhe River. The weather conditions, being harsh, brought an end to the campaign which saw 22 prisoners captured. Ropata was also annoyed at the efforts of Ngāti Kahungunu, which had mounted a similar campaign at the same time, causing the Hauhau remnants to scatter. This reduced the effectiveness of Ropata&#x27;s own operations. When Te Kooti raided a settlement at Uawa, on the East Cape, in late July, Ropata was seeking intelligence on his whereabouts. On hearing of the raid, he raised a war party of over 100 Ngāti Porou to pursue Te Kooti. After a few weeks of fruitless searching for Te Kooti in the bush around Taloga Bay, he withdrew.

Over the following months, Tūhoe envoys carried out peace negotiations with some of Te Kooti&#x27;s allies in the Urewera country. A sticking point was security from repercussions launched by Te Kooti if peace was made. The prospect of a Ngāti Porou garrison force moving into the Urewera country for protection was raised by McLean with Ropata. This required a daily payment to Ngāti Porou participants since the purpose was not the capture of Te Kooti, and thus there was no bounty available. Ropata took a party of 170 warriors to the Urewera country in mid-January 1871. Despite no bounty being on offer for the capture of Te Kooti, Ropata decided to go by way of the Waimana valley to look for him. It was rumoured he was hiding there. Two weeks of fruitless searching followed before they proceeded to Maungapohatu, as a &quot;rangitara&quot; had advised Ropata that it would be better to pacify the Tūhoe there. This was achieved and he proceeded east, continuing to look for Te Kooti. A follower of his was captured, who provided useful intelligence and led them to Te Kooti&#x27;s &quot;pā&quot;. Although he was not there, another key follower of his was captured and food supplies were destroyed. Ropata&#x27;s expedition ended in April and they returned to Tūranga, worn out from the weeks of marching over the hill country of the Urerewas. Ropata himself was covered with boils.

Despite this, in June Ropata assembled another party to hunt for Te Kooti. His 200 men were split into four groups of 50 and pursued different routes. Ropata commanded one group and Porter another. Being mid-winter, conditions were harsh and by the time Ropata ended his search in early August, three of his men had died of exhaustion while many others were sick. He had succeeded in capturing small groups of Ringatū adherents who claimed to have lost contact with Te Kooti. Once in Gisborne, he received information that Te Kooti may be staying at a site on Lake Waikaremoana. Ropata almost immediately left for the area with a fresh group of Ngāti Porou warriors. Porter, still accompanying Ropata, struck out for sites previously searched to ensure that Te Kooti had not returned to them. He linked up with a Te Arawa party hunting Te Kooti after he escaped them following an attack on his campsite at Waipaoa. In the meantime, Ropata searched the likely areas where he believed Te Kooti might be. However, he became sick, and for most of September stayed in camp in the Mangaaruhe area while his party carried out local patrols. Porter&#x27;s party had more success, and on 1 September his party surrounded Te Kooti&#x27;s camp at Te Hapua, although Te Kooti himself escaped. Porter and Ropata, now recovered from his illness, met up at Maungapohatu, and then moved onto Ruatahuna, where they were advised that Kereopa Te Rau, who was one of the Hauhau involved in the murder of Völkner in 1865, was living a few hours away. Kereopa, who had a bounty of £1,000 for his capture, was seized in a surprise raid mounted by the Ngāti Porou party on 18 November. Following this, Tūhoe made peace with the Government, and Ropata withdrew his party, ending the Ngāti Porou campaigns in the Urewera country. The pursuit of Te Kooti was left to the Te Arawa.

==Later life==

By the end of Te Kooti&#x27;s War Ropata was recognised as one of the leading men of Ngāti Porou due to his actions as a &quot;kūpapa&quot;. He used his influence to strengthen the &quot;iwi&quot;&#x27;s position with the Government, ensuring that it maintained its promise to not confiscate Ngāti Porou land. Te Kooti himself continued to evade capture and was eventually given refuge in the King Country.

Ropata settled at Waiōmatatini and constructed a &quot;marae&quot; (meeting house) there, calling it Porourangi. An advocate for education, when a school was established at Waiōmatatini in 1871, he was its chairman. He would fine parents whose children did not attend the school without good reason. Conscious of his own inability in the language, he particularly urged teaching of English to Māori students. He became a land agent for the Government, facilitating the sale or leasing of Ngāti Porou land. This saw much of his &quot;iwi&quot;&#x27;s land being leased, ensuring it remained in Ngāti Porou hands in the long term. He particularly encouraged the use of the Native Land Court to settle disputes. He also took up sheep farming. In his later years, his herd numbered over 2,400 sheep.

During the general election of 1875 he opposed Karaitiana Takamoana of Ngāti Kahungunu, who was standing for Parliament in the Eastern Maori electorate. Takamoana was the leader of the Repudiation movement, which involved some former Hauhau and sought to recover Māori land through litigation. Ropata was against the movement; he tried to exert undue influence in the electorate in favour of his preferred candidate for the seat, Hōtene Porourangi, but was unsuccessful.

In 1878 Ropata was awarded the Sword of Honour from Queen Victoria in recognition of his service in the conflicts against the Pai Mārire and Te Kooti. He was also entitled to the New Zealand War Medal. From 1878, he was commander of the regional militia, with a salary of £200 a year, until 1884, when cost cutting measures saw an end to the position being salaried. In his later years, he received an annual pension of £100. On 10 May 1887 he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council. Two years later, he eventually got the chance to arrest Te Kooti, who had been pardoned in 1883. Since then Te Kooti had built up a large religious following. This was tolerated until 1889 when he decided to return to Poverty Bay, the scene of his earlier exploits. Ropata and Porter, still working together, were appointed by the then Prime Minister, Harry Atkinson, to make sure Te Kooti did not enter the East Cape or Urewera country. Ngāti Porou were mobilised and arrived on the scene just as Te Kooti was arrested by a police inspector, in time to prevent his followers from making a violent issue of it. Ropata missed the actual arrest because of ill health.

==Death and legacy==

Ropata died in Gisborne on 1 July 1897. Before his death, he stressed to his &quot;hapu&quot; that they should remain united and loyal to the Crown, committed to Christianity and congenial to &quot;pākehā&quot;. He was buried with full military honours nearly two weeks later at an &quot;urupā&quot; (burial ground) on Puputa, a rocky outcrop behind the Porourangi marae at Waiōmatatini. Porter was a pall bearer. A year after his death, the Government erected a memorial at Puputa in recognition of Ropata&#x27;s services to the Crown. His grand-nephew, Sir Āpirana Ngata, is buried nearby.

Since the 1860s, Ropata has been described as a &quot;Kūpapa&quot;, for example by historians James Belich and Michael King. This is generally understood as meaning Māori who were neutral or loyal to the Government. However, in recent times, the term has also been used in a derogatory sense, to refer to Māori who aligned themselves with the Government to the disadvantage of other Māori. According to Crosby, Ropata should be more correctly characterised as being loyal to his &quot;iwi&quot; and the honouring of the Treaty of Waitangi, which guaranteed the security of Ngāti Porou lands. He took a pragmatic approach to collaboration with the Government to ensure his &quot;iwi&quot;&#x27;s land was not confiscated given that at least some Ngāti Porou became Hauhau during the East Cape War.

<text>&quot;Isle of Beauty, Isle of Splendour&quot; is the popular title for the national anthem of Dominica. It was adopted upon the island gaining statehood in 1967 and again with Dominica&#x27;s independence in 1978. The lyrics are by Wilfred Oscar Morgan Pond (1912–1985), and the music was composed by Lemuel McPherson Christian OBE (1917–2000).

The anthem was listed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as one of the 10 best national anthems of countries competing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;I
Isle of beauty, isle of splendour,
Isle to all so sweet and fair,
All must surely gaze in wonder
At thy gifts so rich and rare.
Rivers, valleys, hills and mountains,
All these gifts we do extol.
Healthy land, so like all fountains,
Giving cheer that warms the soul.

II
Dominica, God hath blest thee
With a clime benign and bright,
Pastures green and flowers of beauty
Filling all with pure delight,
And a people strong and healthy,
Full of godly reverent fear.
May we ever seek to praise Thee
For these gifts so rich and rare.

III
Come ye forward, sons and daughters
Of this gem beyond compare.
Strive for honour, sons and daughters,
Do the right, be firm, be fair.
Toil with hearts and hands and voices.
We must prosper! Sound the call,
In which ev&#x27;ryone rejoices,
&quot;All for Each and Each for All.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Bourg-en-Bresse (; ) is the prefecture of the Ain department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in Eastern France. Located northeast of Lyon, it is the capital of the ancient province of Bresse (). In 2018, the commune had a population of 41,248.

==Geography==
Bourg-en-Bresse is located at the western base of the Jura Mountains, on the left bank of the Reyssouze, a tributary of the Saône. It lies northeast of Lyon and south-southwest of Lons-le-Saunier.

==History==
Roman remains have been discovered at Bourg, but little is known of its early history. It was probably pillaged by Goths in Late Antiquity. Raised to the rank of a free town in 1250, it was at the beginning of the 15th century the capital of the dukes of Savoy in the province of Bresse. In February 1535 it was conquered by France during a full-scale invasion of Savoy, but was restored to Duke Philibert Emmanuel in 1559, when he married Henri II&#x27;s sister Marguerite. The duke later built a strong citadel, which afterwards withstood a six-months&#x27; siege by the soldiers of Henry IV during the Franco-Savoyard War of 1600–1601. The town was finally ceded to France in 1601. In 1814, the inhabitants, in spite of the defenseless condition of their town, offered resistance to the Austrians, who put the place to pillage.

==Demographics==
== Politics ==

Since 2008, Jean-François Debat of the Socialist Party (PS) has been Mayor of Bourg-en-Bresse. He was reelected following the 2020 municipal election.

In the four last presidential elections, Bourg-en-Bresse voted as following:

== Sights ==
Bourg-en-Bresse Cathedral, also known as the church of Notre-Dame (&quot;Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Annonciation de Bourg-en-Bresse&quot;), which dates back to the 16th century, has a façade built in the Renaissance; other parts of the church are Gothic. In the interior there are stalls of the 16th century.

The other public buildings, including a handsome prefecture, are modern. The town hall contains a library and the Lorin Museum with a collection of pictures, while another museum has a collection of old costumes and ornaments characteristic of Bresse. Among the statues in the town there is one of historian Edgar Quinet, a native of Bourg-en-Bresse.

The Royal Monastery of Brou, named after the suburb settlement of Bourg-en-Bresse in which it lies, is of great artistic interest. Margaret of Bourbon, wife of Philip II of Savoy, had intended to found a monastery on the spot, but died before her intention could be carried into effect. The church was actually built early in the 16th century by her daughter-in-law Margaret of Austria, wife of Philibert le Beau of Savoy, in memory of her husband.

The exterior, especially the &quot;façade&quot;, is richly ornamented, but the chief interest lies in the works of art in the interior, which date from 1532. The most important are the three mausoleums with the marble effigies of Marguerite of Bourbon, Philibert le Beau and Margaret of Austria. All three are remarkable for perfection of sculpture and richness of ornamentation. The rood loft, the oak stalls and the reredos in the chapel of the Virgin are masterpieces in a similar style. The monastery has three cloisters from the early 16th century. The church and the cloisters are listed monuments.

<doc id="263843" wikidata="Q866223" url="?curid=263843" title="National Anthem of the Dominican Republic">
<text>The [[national anthem]] of the [[Dominican Republic]] (), also known by its incipit Valiant Quisqueyans (), was composed by José Rufino Reyes y Siancas (1835–1905), and its lyrics were authored by Emilio Prud&#x27;Homme (1856–1932).

==History==
José Reyes was inspired to create a national anthem for the Dominican Republic after having seen the Argentine National Anthem in the Parisian newspaper &quot;El Americano&quot;. In 1883, he invited his friend Emilio Prud&#x27;Homme to write lyrics for the anthem.

The first version of Prud&#x27;Homme&#x27;s lyrics was published in the weekly newspaper &quot;El Eco de la Opinion&quot; on 16 August 1883, and the first public performance of the anthem took place the next day on 17 August in Respectable Hope Lodge No. 9 in Santo Domingo. Though the music was an instant success, several objections were made to the lyrics for having various historical inaccuracies. In 1897, Prud’Homme submitted revised lyrics, which stand to this day.

On 7 June 1897, the Congress of the Dominican Republic passed an act adopting &quot;Himno Nacional&quot; with the original music and revised lyrics as the country&#x27;s official national anthem; however, then-President Ulises Heureaux (1846–1898) vetoed the act, because the lyric&#x27;s author, Prud’Homme, was an opponent of the president and his administration. In 1899, Heureaux was assassinated, and the political disorder that ensued prevented the national anthem&#x27;s legal adoption until 30 May 1934, when &quot;Himno Nacional&quot; was officially adopted and signed into law.

==Lyric==
The Spanish name of the Dominican Republic, &quot;, is never used in the anthem&#x27;s official Spanish lyrics, nor is the demonym for Dominicans, &quot;. Rather, the indigenous word for the island of Hispaniola, &quot;, is used twice, and its derivative demonym, &quot;, is used once. However, research later showed that these words do not seem to derive from the original Arawak Taíno language.

In public, the national anthem is usually performed through the end of the lyric&#x27;s fourth paragraph.

<text>Epic Records is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, the American division of Japanese conglomerate Sony. The label was founded predominantly as a jazz and classical music label in 1953, but later expanded its scope to include a more diverse range of genres, including pop, R&amp;B, rock, and hip-hop. Epic Records&#x27; current artists roster includes Travis Scott, Future, 21 Savage, Tyla, Meghan Trainor, Madison Beer, André 3000, Tori Kelly, Beam, Bia, Judas Priest, Sade, Lamb of God, Coi Leray, DDG, Zara Larsson, Doe Boy, Eddie Benjamin, Fiona Apple, Giveon, Headie One, Mariah the Scientist, Mario, Ozzy Osbourne, Real Boston Richey, Sara Bareilles, ScarLip, Yolanda Adams, Tom Walker, and will.i.am.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Epic Records was launched in 1953 by the Columbia Records unit of CBS, for the purpose of marketing jazz, pop, and classical music that did not fit the theme of its more mainstream Columbia Records label. Initial classical music releases were from Philips Records which distributed Columbia product in Europe. Pop talent on co-owned Okeh Records were transferred to Epic which made Okeh a rhythm and blues label. Epic&#x27;s bright-yellow, black, and blue logo became a familiar trademark for many jazz and classical releases. This has included such notables as the Berlin Philharmonic, Charles Rosen, the Juilliard String Quartet, Antal Doráti conducting the Hague Philharmonic, and George Szell conducting the Cleveland Orchestra.

===Expansion of genres and mainstream success===
By 1960, Epic became better known for signing newer, fledgling acts. By the end of the 1960s, Epic earned its first gold records and had evolved into a formidable hit-making force in rock and roll, R&amp;B and country music. Among its many acts, it included Roy Hamilton, Bobby Vinton, the Dave Clark Five, the Hollies, Tammy Wynette, Donovan, the Yardbirds, Lulu, July, Helen Shapiro, Cliff Richard, and Jeff Beck. Several of the British artists on the Epic roster during the 1960s were the result of CBS&#x27;s Epic/Okeh units&#x27; 1962 international distribution deal with EMI; Epic recordings were issued via this arrangement by EMI on the Columbia label. Other British artists appearing on Epic were a result of signings to the new UK CBS affiliate formed after the acquisition of Oriole Records (UK) in August 1964.

Epic was involved in a notable &quot;trade&quot; of artists. Graham Nash was signed to Epic because of his membership in The Hollies. When the newly formed Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash wanted to sign with Atlantic Records, Ahmet Ertegun worked out a deal with Clive Davis whereby Richie Furay&#x27;s new band Poco (having signed with Atlantic due to Furay&#x27;s contract from being in Buffalo Springfield) would sign with Epic.

=== Corporate structure ===
During the 1960s, Epic oversaw the smaller subsidiary CBS labels including Okeh Records and Date Records. In 1968, Epic recordings began being distributed in the UK by CBS after the distribution deal with EMI expired that year; Epic itself launched in England around 1971.

Sony Corporation bought CBS Records in 1987, and the company was renamed Sony Music in 1991. It began splitting European operations into two separate labels, Epic and Columbia, in 1992, and in 1997, Sony Music Australia and New Zealand followed suit.

In 2004, Sony merged with music distributor BMG, bringing Arista Records, Columbia Records, Epic Records, J Records, Jive Records, RCA Records, and Zomba Group of Companies to one parent company known as Sony BMG Music Entertainment. In 2008, Sony bought out BMG for $1.2 billion, bringing all affiliated labels together as Sony Music Entertainment International, SMEI. The merger was approved by the European Union in 2009.

=== 1980s–2010===
In 1983, John Hammond Sr. signed Stevie Ray Vaughan to Epic Records. 
Epic Soundtrax was founded as a film soundtrack label in 1992. It was central to Epic&#x27;s 1990s success, with 11 soundtrack releases cumulatively selling more than 40 million records over a three-year period. Notable releases included soundtrack albums for &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot;, &quot;Singles&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and &quot;Judgment Night&quot;.

In 1999, Jennifer Lopez released her debut album &quot;On the 6&quot; (as part of WORK Group), which was a critical and commercial success, going-on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide. Lopez&#x27;s sophomore album, &quot;J.Lo&quot; (2001), experienced similar—if not greater—success, initially selling over 8 million copies worldwide, and gaining multi-platinum status under Epic Records. The record spawned several international and domestic hits, including &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot;, &quot;Play&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t it Funny&quot;. With her second album, Lopez became the first female solo artist, under the record company, to reach the number one spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The 2002 remix album &quot;J TO THA L-O! The Remixes&quot;, which served as a follow-up to Lopez&#x27;s sophomore effort, was the first remix album to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and became the fourth best selling remix album of all time, behind albums by Michael Jackson (fellow Epic Records artist), Madonna and The Beatles. Furthermore, in the second week at number-one for the remix album, Lopez&#x27;s remixed single &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny (Murder Remix)&quot; (with Ja Rule), was also number one, making Lopez the only artist in history to have a number one remix album and single in the same week. Lopez&#x27;s third studio album, released in late 2002, was also a success, titled &quot;This is me... Then&quot;; the record sold 6 million copies worldwide and peaked at the second spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Lopez&#x27;s first full-length Spanish debut, &quot;Como Ama Una Mujer&quot;, became the first Spanish-language debut album to enter the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has sold 1 million copies worldwide. This was Lopez&#x27;s final studio album under Epic Records before her move to Island Def Jam and Capitol Records; she released her first greatest hits compilation, &quot;Dance Again... The Hits&quot;, gaining critical success.

In February 2009, Sony Music Group chairman Rob Stringer appointed singer-songwriter Amanda Ghost as president of Epic. Ghost, who had successfully promoted James Blunt to Grammy Award-winning status, was an unconventional and controversial choice for president because she had no corporate executive experience. She was expected to reverse the trend of declining sales at Epic by promoting the label&#x27;s newer and mid-tier artists such as Augustana. Stringer also merged Epic and Columbia to form the Columbia/Epic Label Group in 2009, with himself as acting chairman. Ghost scored hit records for the Fray, Modest Mouse, Matisyahu and Sean Kingston. However, she delayed the scheduled release of Shakira&#x27;s album &quot;She Wolf&quot; by insisting that the album contain another song – &quot;Give It Up to Me&quot; featuring Lil Wayne and uncredited Timbaland. This delay probably caused &quot;She Wolf&quot; to perform less well in the market. Epic staff members described Ghost as &quot;abrasive&quot; and a &quot;loose cannon&quot;. She was fired in October 2010, with Stringer apologizing for his mistake: &quot;I owe the people at Epic...&quot;

=== 2011–2023 ===
In July 2011, L.A. Reid became the CEO of Epic Records, signing artists such as TLC, Toni Braxton, Cher Lloyd, Avril Lavigne, Outkast, Future, Yo Gotti, Ciara, Meghan Trainor, DJ Khaled, and Travis Scott. Epic also signed the winners of &quot;The X Factor&quot; during the seasons that Reid appeared on the show.

In February 2012, Epic Records signed experimental hip-hop/punk rap trio, Death Grips, under the recommendation of, then executive vice president of marketing, Angelica Cob-Baehler. They released their, arguably, most commercially successful album The Money Store (album) in April 2012. They were later dropped from the label following conflict due to cancelling a tour to work on their next album, No Love Deep Web, and releasing it for legal download on Peer-to-peer connection site, BitTorrent, to bypass Epic Records&#x27; desire to release it in 2013.

In 2013, Sylvia Rhone, former president of Universal Motown, launched the imprint Vested In Culture through Epic Records. A year later,
she was named president of Epic.

In November 2014, Mosley Music Group created a joint venture with Sony Music- with marketing, publicity, distribution and overall label services provided by Epic. The joint venture was created due to Timbaland&#x27;s previous co-collaboration with Reid on Michael Jackson&#x27;s posthumous album, &quot;Xscape&quot;. Previously operated by Interscope, most of MMG&#x27;s roster moved to Epic.

In 2015, Def Jam Recordings parted ways with Mariah Carey and Carey reunited with Reid at Epic. She had worked with Reid at Def Jam under The Island Def Jam Music Group in 2004. Carey&#x27;s deals with both Def Jam and Epic were at a fraction of the $80 million deal Carey had previously signed with Virgin Records; Virgin later rescinded that deal after poor sales. That same month, it was announced that R&amp;B group Jodeci had signed to the label and planned to release their first studio album in 20 years.

Wondaland Records, singer Janelle Monáe&#x27;s imprint, entered into a joint venture with Epic in 2015. Acts on Wondaland include Jidenna, St. Beauty, Deep Cotton and Roman GianArthur.

In 2016, Jennifer Lopez returned to Sony Music, six years after leaving in favor of Island Def Jam and Capitol Records. Lopez&#x27;s multi-album deal reunited her with Reid, whom she signed with at Island Def Jam in 2010.

In January 2017, 21 Savage signed to Epic. On May 11, 2017, it was announced that Reid would exit as the label&#x27;s CEO. Following his exit, it was reported that Reid had been accused of sexual harassment by multiple Epic employees.

On April 23, 2019, it was announced that Rhone had been appointed as Chair and CEO of the label. In April 2023, Sony Music UK announced the relaunch of Epic Records UK as one of their frontline labels, with former publishing executive Sarah Lockhart appointed as president.

<doc id="263860" wikidata="Q273296" url="?curid=263860" title="Sangria">
<text>Sangria ( , ; ) is an alcoholic beverage originating in Spain and Portugal. A punch, sangria traditionally consists of red wine and chopped fruit, often with other ingredients or spirits.

Under EU regulations only Spain and Portugal can label their product as Sangria; similar products from different regions are differentiated in name. Clericó is a similar beverage that is popular in Latin America.

Sangria is very popular among foreign tourists in Spain even if locals do not consume the beverage that much. It is commonly served in bars, restaurants, and chiringuitos and at festivities throughout Portugal and Spain.

==History and etymology==
&quot;Sangria&quot;/&quot;sangría&quot; means &quot;bloodletting&quot; in Spanish and in Portuguese. The term &quot;sangria&quot; used for the drink can be traced back to the 18th century.

Sangria has its historical roots in the Kingdom of León during the Middle Ages, where the precursor beverage, Leonese lemonade, originated. During this era, residents of the Leonese kingdom crafted this concoction using wine, oranges, lemons, sugar, and spices. Wine lemonade has endured as a popular beverage in the region of Castile and León in Spain, gaining prominence in consumption, particularly during Holy Week.

The sangria cocktail, on the other hand, has been enjoyed since at least the early 19th century. &quot;Sangaree&quot;, a predecessor drink to sangria that was served either hot or cold, probably originated in the Caribbean (West Indies), and from there was introduced to mainland America, where it was common beginning in the American colonial era but had &quot;largely disappeared in the United States&quot; by the early twentieth century. Hispanic Americans and Spanish restaurants had re-introduced sangria to the U.S. as an iced drink by the late 1940s, and it gained greater popularity through the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in New York.

==Recipe==

Sangria recipes vary wildly even within Spain, with many regional distinctions. The base ingredients are always red wine, and some means to add a fruity or sweeter flavour, and maybe boost the alcohol content.

Traditionally sangria may be mixed with local fruits such as peaches, nectarines, berries, apples, pears, or global fruits such as pineapple or lime, and sweetened with sugar and orange juice. Spanish Rioja red wine is traditionally used. Some sangria recipes, in addition to wine and fruit, feature additional ingredients, such as brandy, sparkling water, or a flavored liqueur.

&quot;Sangria blanca&quot; (sangria with white wine) is a more recent innovation. For &quot;sangria blanca&quot;, American food writer Penelope Casas recommends dry white wines such as a Rueda, Jumilla, or Valdepeñas.

&quot;Ponche de Sangria&quot; is a variation for children, often for birthday parties. Oranges, peaches, and other sugary fruits are combined with berries, grapes, or food coloring in order to create the coloration of sangria. A soft drink typically replaces the wine.

===European Union law protection===
Under European Union law, the use of sangria in commercial or trade labeling is now restricted under geographical labeling rules. The European Parliament approved new labeling laws by a wide margin in January 2014, protecting indications for aromatized drinks, including sangria, Vermouth and Glühwein. Only sangria made in Spain and Portugal is allowed to be sold as &quot;sangria&quot; in the EU; sangria made elsewhere must be labeled as such (e.g., as &quot;German sangria&quot; or &quot;Swedish sangria&quot;).

The definition of &quot;sangria&quot; under European Union law according to the 2014 Regulation states that it is an:

The 2014 regulation also recognises &#x27;clarea&#x27; as an aromatised wine-based drink, which is obtained from white wine under the same conditions as for sangría. Clarea may be used as a sales denomination only when the product is produced in Spain. When the product is produced in other Member States, &#x27;clarea&#x27; may only be used to supplement the sales denomination &#x27;aromatised wine-based drink&#x27;, provided that it is accompanied by the words: &#x27;produced in&#x27;, followed by the name of the Member State of production or of a more restricted region.

<doc id="263861" wikidata="Q1057427" url="?curid=263861" title="World Cup of Hockey">
<text>The World Cup of Hockey is an international ice hockey tournament. Inaugurated in 1996, it is the successor to the Canada Cup, which was held every three to five years from 1976 to 1991 and was the first international hockey championship to allow nations to field their top players. The World Cup has occurred thrice before on an irregular basis, with the United States winning in 1996 and Canada winning in 2004 and 2016. Following the 2016 tournament, it was uncertain whether the series would be continued, after the cancellation of the 2020 tournament. It is tentatively scheduled to be held every four years, starting in 2028.

The World Cup of Hockey is organized by the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA), unlike the annual Ice Hockey World Championships and quadrennial Olympic tournament, both run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). World Cup games are played under NHL rules and not those of the IIHF, and the tournament occurs prior to the NHL pre-season, allowing all the NHL&#x27;s players to be available, unlike the World Championships, which overlaps with the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup playoffs.

==History==

===Canada Cup===

The World Cup of Hockey was preceded by the Canada Cup, which began in 1976 in a combined effort from Doug Fisher of Hockey Canada and Alan Eagleson of the NHL Players&#x27; Association. Taking inspiration from soccer&#x27;s FIFA World Cup, Eagleson proposed a new tournament that would bring together all the top hockey–playing nations. After successful negotiations with hockey officials from the Soviet Union in September 1974, Eagleson began arranging the Canada Cup tournament, which debuted in 1976. It was the first international ice hockey tournament that allowed hockey nations to field their top players, as the Winter Olympics was nominally an amateur competitior at the time and the annual World Championships clashed with the Stanley Cup playoffs.

The tournaments, held every three to five years, took place in North American venues prior to the start of the National Hockey League (NHL) regular season. Six teams competed in each edition. Of the five Canada Cup tournaments, four were won by Canada, and one by the Soviet Union in 1981.

===World Cup of Hockey===

In 1996, the Canada Cup was officially replaced by the World Cup of Hockey. The Canada Cup trophy was retired. The tournament expanded to eight teams: as the national teams of Canada, the United States, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden, popularly dubbed as the Big Six, were joined by Germany and Slovakia. The United States defeated Canada in the finals to win the inaugural event.

Eight years later, the second installment of the World Cup of Hockey took place in 2004, just prior to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Canada won its first tournament championship, defeating the Czech Republic in the semifinals and Finland in the final match.

On January 24, 2015, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced the 2016 World Cup of Hockey to be held in September 2016 at Air Canada Centre in Toronto. The 2016 edition featured a slightly modified format: alongside the Big Six countries, there were two all-star teams, consisting of Team Europe and an under-23 Team North America. Canada again won the championship, defeating Team Europe in the finals.

A 2020 edition was planned to include a European qualification tournament to determine some participating nations. In January 2019, plans for the tournament were abandoned due to the pending expiration of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the NHL and the NHL Players&#x27; Association. In August 2019, it was reported that a World Cup could take place in February 2021 if the CBA could be extended or renewed; however, this was ruled-out by the NHL later that year.

In February 2024, the NHL announced plans to hold the next World Cup in 2028 and every four years after that. The NHL is hosting the 4 Nations Face-Off in lieu of a World Cup in February 2025. On February 12, 2025, the NHL again announced that the tournament would return in February 2028, launching a commitment to send NHL players to the 2030 Winter Olympics. It was mentioned that the Olympics and World Cup are going to rotate every two years starting with the 2026 Winter Olympics and the teams will be solicited by the league and the NHLPA.

==Trophy==
In 2004, Canadian American architect Frank Gehry designed a new trophy for the tournament. It is made from a composite alloy of copper and nickel as well as solid cast urethane plastic. The trophy was criticized by the sports community, including the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;&#x27;s headline &quot;What is that?&quot;

<text>The Juilliard String Quartet is a classical music string quartet founded in 1946 at the Juilliard School in New York by William Schuman and Robert Mann. Since its inception, it has been the quartet-in-residence at the Juilliard School. It has received numerous awards, including four Grammys and membership in the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. In February 2011, the group received the NARAS Lifetime Achievement Award for its outstanding contributions to recorded classical music.

As of 2022, the quartet&#x27;s members are violinists Areta Zhulla and Ronald Copes, violist Molly Carr, and cellist Astrid Schween.

== History ==

=== First era: 1946–1996 ===
The quartet was founded by Juilliard School president William Schuman and violin faculty member Robert Mann in 1946. The original members were Mann and violinist Robert Koff, violist Raphael Hillyer and cellist Arthur Winograd. It began recording with Columbia Records upon its founding. Between March and August 1949, the quartet became the first group to record Béla Bartók&#x27;s complete string quartets. Columbia released the recordings in 1950. Around the time of its public and recording debuts, the Juilliard Quartet quickly established itself as a premier American ensemble on the international level. 

In 1953, the group was the first to record Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s complete quartets. In 1955, Claus Adam replaced Winograd as the group&#x27;s cellist. In 1958, Isidore Cohen replaced Koff as second violinist. 

In 1962, the Juilliard String Quartet replaced the Budapest String Quartet as the Library of Congress&#x27;s quartet in residence. That year, the quartet performed at the Library with a set of Stradivarius instruments Gertrude Clarke Whittall donated in the 1930s. In 1966, Earl Carlyss replaced Cohen as second violinist and three years later, Samuel Rhodes replaced Hillyer as violist. 

In 1974, Joel Krosnick replaced his teacher Adam as the cellist. By 1981, the Juilliard Quartet was said to have performed in over 3,000 concerts in 43 different countries. In 1986, Joel Smirnoff replaced Carlyss as second violinist.

In 1996, Mann announced his intention to retire. He played his last concert as a member of the quartet at the Tanglewood Music Festival that year. Smirnoff took over as first violinist and Ronald Copes joined the group as second violinist.

=== 21st century: 1997–present ===
In 2005, the quartet performed in Madrid for Queen Sofía of Spain on the set of Stradivarius Palatinos instruments owned by the Royal Palace of Madrid. In 2009, Nick Eanet replaced Smirnoff as first violinist. He left the group in 2010 for health reasons and was replaced by Joseph Lin of the Formosa Quartet.

In 2013, Roger Tapping replaced Rhodes as violist. In 2015, the quartet released an app for Apple&#x27;s iOS called &quot;Juilliard String Quartet – An Exploration of Schubert’s Death and the Maiden&quot;. Ulysses Arts issued the recording separately. The London-based app developer Touchpress and the Juilliard School co-produced the app, which features the quartet in a performance of Franz Schubert’s String Quartet No. 14 in D minor (&quot;Death and the Maiden&quot;). In 2016, Astrid Schween replaced Krosnick as cellist, becoming the quartet&#x27;s first female member. Areta Zhulla then replaced Lin as first violinist. After Tapping&#x27;s death in 2022, Molly Carr became the quartet&#x27;s new violist.

== Repertoire ==
The quartet plays a wide range of classical music, and has recorded works by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Bartók, Debussy and Shostakovich, among others, while also promoting more contemporary composers such as Elliott Carter, Ralph Shapey, Henri Dutilleux and Milton Babbitt. It has performed with other noted musicians, such as Aaron Copland, Glenn Gould, Benita Valente and also (in its early days) the scientist Albert Einstein. It can be heard on the soundtrack of the movie Immortal Beloved. By the early 1990s, the quartet was said to have produced more than 100 recordings and performed over 500 unique works.

<text>Beauvais ( , ; ) is a town and commune in northern France, and prefecture of the Oise département, in the Hauts-de-France region, north of Paris.

The commune of Beauvais had a population of 56,020 , making it the most populous town in the Oise department, and third most populous in Picardy. Together with its suburbs and satellite towns, the metropolitan area of Beauvais has a population of 128,020.

The region around Beauvais is called the Beauvaisis.

== History ==
Beauvais was known to the Romans by the Gallo-Roman name of &quot;Caesaromagus&quot; (&quot;magos&quot; is Common Celtic for &quot;field&quot;). The post-Renaissance Latin rendering is &quot;Bellovacum&quot; from the Belgic tribe the Bellovaci, whose capital it was. In the ninth century, it became a county (comté), which about 1013 passed to the bishops of Beauvais, who became peers of France from the twelfth century. At the coronations of kings, the Bishop of Beauvais wore the royal mantle and went, with the Bishop of Langres, to raise the king from his throne to present him to the people.

&quot;De Bello Gallico&quot; II 13 reports that as Julius Caesar was approaching a fortified town called Bratuspantium in the land of the Bellovaci, its inhabitants surrendered to him when he was about 5 Roman miles away. Its name is Gaulish for &quot;place where judgements are made&quot;, from *&quot;bratu-spantion&quot;. Some say that Bratuspantium is Beauvais. Others theorise that it is Vendeuil-Caply or Bailleul sur Thérain.

From 1004 to 1037, the Count of Beauvais was Odo II, Count of Blois.

In a charter dated 1056/1060, Eudo of Brittany granted land &quot;in pago Belvacensi&quot; (Beauvais, Picardy) to the Abbey of Angers Saint-Aubin (see Albinus of Angers).

In 1346, the town had to defend itself against the English, who again besieged it in 1433. The siege that it endured in 1472 at the hands of the Duke of Burgundy was rendered famous by the heroism of the town&#x27;s women, under the leadership of Jeanne Hachette, whose memory is still celebrated by a procession on 27 June (the feast of Sainte Angadrême), during which women take precedence over men.

A significant hoard of coins from the High Middle Ages became known as the &quot;Beauvais Hoard&quot; because some of the English and European coins found with the lot were from the French abbey located in Beauvais. The hoard, which contained a variety of rare and extremely rare Anglo-Norman pennies, English and foreign coins, was reputed to have been found in or near Paris.

Beauvais was extensively damaged during World War I, and again in World War II during the German advance on Paris in June 1940. Much of the older part of the city was all but destroyed, and the cathedral was badly damaged before being liberated by British forces on 30 August 1944.

Beauvais experienced significant rioting during the Nahel Merzouk protests in 2023.

== Geography ==
Beauvais lies at the foot of wooded hills on the left bank of the Thérain at its confluence with the Avelon. Its ancient ramparts have been destroyed, and it is now surrounded by boulevards, outside of which run branches of the Thérain. In addition, there are spacious promenades in the north-east of the town.

===Climate===
Beauvais experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature is 9.9 °C (1961–1990), and the sunlight annual average of 1669 hours (1991–2010). Hills Bray is provided for the precipitation of Beauvais. The precipitation is 669 mm on average per year (1981–2010), while it is 800 mm on average per year in Bray. However, the frequency of rainfall is high. The average number of days per year above the precipitation of 1 mm is 116 days or every third day. The fog is often present, it is estimated at 55 days a year. The department is affected by 41 days of average wind year, usually, it comes from the west to the south.
==Climate==

==Population==

The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Beauvais proper in its geography at the given years. The commune of Beauvais absorbed the former communes of Marissel, Saint-Just-des-Marais and Voisinlieu and part of Notre-Dame-du-Thil in 1943.

== Sights ==

=== Cathedral ===

The city&#x27;s cathedral, dedicated to Saint Peter (&quot;Cathédrale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais&quot;), in some respects, the most daring achievement of Gothic architecture, consists only of a transept and quire with apse and seven apse-chapels. The vaulting in the interior exceeds 46 m or 150 feet in height. The cathedral underwent a major repair and restoration process in 2008.

The small Romanesque church of the 10th century known as the &quot;Basse Oeuvre&quot; occupies the site destined for the nave; much of its east end was demolished to make room for the new cathedral.

Begun in 1247, under Bishop William of Grès (Guillaume de Grès, Guillaume de Grez), an extra were added to the height, to make it the tallest cathedral in Europe: the work was interrupted in 1284 by the collapse of the vaulting of the choir, a disaster that produced a temporary failure of nerve among the masons working in Gothic style. The transept was built from 1500 to 1548. In 1573 the fall of a too-ambitious central tower stopped work again, after which little addition was made.

Its façades, especially that on the south, exhibit all the richness of the late Gothic style. The carved wooden doors of both the north and the south portals are masterpieces respectively of Gothic and Renaissance workmanship. The church possesses an elaborate astronomical clock (1866) and tapestries of the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries; but its chief artistic treasures are stained glass windows of the thirteenth, fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, the most beautiful of them from the hand of the Renaissance artist, Engrand Le Prince, a native of Beauvais. To him also due to some of the stained glass in St. Etienne, the second church of the town, and an interesting example of the transition stage between the Romanesque and Gothic styles.

During the Middle Ages, on 14 January, the Feast of Asses was celebrated in the Beauvais Cathedral, in commemoration of the Flight into Egypt.

=== Other notable sites ===
In the Place de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville and the old streets near the cathedral, several houses are dating from the 12th to the 16th centuries. The Hôtel de Ville, close to which stands the statue of Jeanne Hachette, was built in 1753.

The episcopal palace, now housing the Musée départemental de l&#x27;Oise, was built in the 16th century, partly upon the Gallo-Roman fortifications. The church of &quot;Saint-Étienne&quot; is a Romanesque-Gothic building (early 12th-late 16th centuries), including, in one of its transept&#x27;s portals, a sculpture of the &quot;Wheel of fortune&quot;.

== Transport ==

=== Rail transport ===
The railway station, Gare de Beauvais, opened in 1857 is currently served by several TER lines:
* Beauvais – PersanBeaumont – Paris Gare du Nord 
* Beauvais – Creil 
* Beauvais – Abancourt – Le Tréport

=== Air transport ===

Beauvais–Tillé Airport, dating from the 1930s, lies in the north of the city, in Tillé. It is used as a gateway to Paris by several low-cost carriers. Traffic growth is significant: in 1997, 200,000 passengers used it annually, but by 2006, it was more than 1.8 million. Airport usage increased by 40% a year on average between 2001 and 2005. The airport is mainly used for passenger traffic (only 2 to 3 flights involve freight each month) and serves 48 destinations.

On 5 October 1930, the British airship R101 crashed just outside Beauvais on its maiden overseas voyage, killing 48 of the 54 people on board.

=== Public transport ===

Public transport in Beauvais is provided by (formerly &quot;The Urban Transport network of Beauvaisis&quot; or ). The transit bus (commuter bus) network consists of 25 regular lines which serve Beauvais and its suburbs, including:

* 12 day lines
** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 12 13 14

=== Environmentally friendly transportation ===
To promote cleaner urban transportation and protect the environment, the city began to develop a &quot;Green Plan&quot; (&quot;Plan vert&quot;). Ultimately, the goal is to have a network of bicycle paths.

== Economy ==
The industry of Beauvais comprises, besides the state manufacture of tapestry, which dates from 1664, the manufacture of various kinds of cotton and woollen goods, brushes, toys, boots and shoes, and bricks and tiles. Market-gardening flourishes in the vicinity and an extensive trade is carried on in grain and wine.

The town is the seat of a bishop, a prefect and a &quot;Court of Assizes&quot;; it has &quot;Tribunals of First Instance&quot; and commerce, together with a Chamber of Commerce, a branch of the Bank of France, a higher ecclesiastical seminary, a &quot;lycée&quot; and training colleges.

Amongst the major companies operating in the town are Nestle and Agco (Massey Ferguson). Also present since 1986 is RS Components, founded by Jerry Vaughan, and now operating from a purpose-built distribution centre to the east of the town

Beauvais also has a small airport, Beauvais Tillé, which is used by several low-cost carriers and charter airlines such as Ryanair as a terminal for nearby Paris, to which frequent shuttle buses run.

<doc id="263872" wikidata="Q553514" url="?curid=263872" title="JScript">
<text>JScript is Microsoft&#x27;s legacy dialect of the ECMAScript standard that is used in Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer web browser and HTML Applications, and as a standalone Windows scripting language.

JScript is implemented as an Active Scripting engine. This means that it can be &quot;plugged in&quot; to OLE Automation applications that support Active Scripting, such as Internet Explorer, Active Server Pages, and Windows Script Host. It also means such applications can use multiple Active Scripting languages, e.g., JScript, VBScript or PerlScript.

JScript was first supported in the Internet Explorer 3.0 browser released in August 1996. Its most recent version is JScript 9.0, included in Internet Explorer 9.

JScript 10.0 is a separate dialect, also known as JScript .NET, which adds several new features from the abandoned fourth edition of the ECMAScript standard. It must be compiled for .NET Framework version 2 or version 4, but static type annotations are optional.

JScript has been criticized for being insecure and having multiple security bugs &quot;exploited by nation-state actors&quot;, leading Microsoft to add an option to disable it.

== Comparison to JavaScript ==
As explained by Douglas Crockford in his talk titled &quot;The JavaScript Programming Language&quot; on YUI Theater, 

However, JScript supports conditional compilation, which allows a programmer to selectively execute code within block comments. This is an extension to the ECMAScript standard that is not supported in other JavaScript implementations, thus making the above statement not completely true, although conditional compilation is no longer supported in Internet Explorer 11 Standards mode.

Other internal implementation differences between JavaScript and JScript, at some point in time, are noted on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN). The default type value for the script element in Internet Explorer is JavaScript, while JScript was its alias. In an apparent transition from JScript to JavaScript, online, the Microsoft Edge [Legacy] Developer Guide refers to the Mozilla MDN web reference library as its definitive documentation. As of October 2017, Microsoft MSDN pages for scripting in Internet Explorer are being redirected there as well. This information may not include JScript specific objects, such as Enumerator, which are listed in the JavaScript language reference on Microsoft Docs. Those provide additional features that are not included in the ECMA Standards, whether they are supported in the Edge [Legacy] browser or its predecessor.

== Versions ==
=== JScript (COM Classic) ===
The original JScript is an Active Scripting engine. Like other Active Scripting languages, it is built on the COM/OLE Automation platform and provides scripting capabilities to host applications.

This is the version used when hosting JScript inside a Web page displayed by Internet Explorer, in an HTML application before IE9, as well as in classic ASP, Windows Script Host scripts and other Automation environments.

JScript is sometimes referred to as &quot;classic JScript&quot; or &quot;Active Scripting JScript&quot; to differentiate it from newer .NET-based versions.

Some versions of JScript are available for multiple versions of Internet Explorer and Windows. For example, JScript 5.7 was introduced with Internet Explorer 7.0 and is also installed for Internet Explorer 6.0 with Windows XP Service Pack 3, while JScript 5.8 was introduced with Internet Explorer 8.0 and is also installed with Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows Mobile 6.5.

Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of ECMAScript 5th Edition in Windows 8 Consumer Preview is called &quot;JavaScript&quot; and the corresponding Visual Studio 11 Express Beta includes a &quot;completely new&quot;, full-featured JavaScript editor with IntelliSense enhancements for HTML5 and ECMAScript 5 syntax, &quot;VSDOC&quot; annotations for multiple overloads, simplified DOM configuration, brace matching, collapsible outlining and &quot;go to definition&quot;.

JScript is also available on Windows CE (included in Windows Mobile, optional in Windows Embedded CE). The Windows CE version lacks Active Debugging.

=== Managed JScript ===
Managed JScript is an implementation of JScript for the Dynamic Language Runtime, it is part of Microsoft&#x27;s dynamic languages for .NET along with IronRuby, IronPython, and Dynamic Visual Basic.
Unlike JScript .NET, which is less dynamic than the original JScript but provides CLS compatibility, Managed JScript is designed on top of the DLR and provides the features needed for scripting scenarios.

While it is primarily designed to be used within Silverlight and ASP.NET at this time, it can also easily be embedded within any .NET application.

Two builds of Managed JScript exist: one for the Desktop CLR and one for the Silverlight CoreCLR
Managed JScript is not supported in the .NET Compact Framework.

(Source: files versions of Microsoft.JScript.Runtime.dll in ASP.NET Futures and Silverlight 1.1 folders)

=== JScript &quot;Chakra&quot; (JsRT) ===

JScript &quot;Chakra&quot; is based on the JScript (COM classic) version, but it has been redesigned to improve performance in Internet Explorer 9 at the expense of proper Active Scripting engine compatibility. It requires a specific Microsoft JavaScript Hosting (JsRT) API for proper use. Therefore, it is installed side by side with JScript 5.x and is only used by Internet Explorer 9 and later as well as JsRT hosts, while other Active Scripting hosts keep using the 5.x version when requesting the JScript engine.

There are two versions of the Chakra JsRT engine.
The original one was used by Internet Explorer 9 and later, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;jscript9.dll&quot; or &quot;legacy Chakra engine&quot;, and a second one used by Microsoft Edge Legacy browser and sometimes referred to as &quot;new Chakra engine&quot;, &quot;Edge engine&quot; or &quot;Chakra.dll&quot;.
Both Chakra JsRT versions can be used by other applications using the JsRT API and can be installed side by side.

There is also a COM Classic version of Chakra internally called &quot;JScript 9 Legacy&quot; (provided by jscript9Legacy.dll), introduced with Windows 11 24H2, which brings back compatibility with Active Scripting hosts and intended as a compatible drop-in replacement for JScript 5.8. Although largely compatible with the original JScript 5.8, there are notable breaking differences.

See separate page about new Chakra (Edge) engine.

=== JScript .NET (CLI) ===

JScript .NET is a Microsoft .NET implementation of JScript. It is a CLI language and thus inherits very powerful features, but lacks many features of the original JScript language, making it inappropriate for many scripting scenarios.
JScript .NET can be used for ASP.NET pages and for complete .NET applications, but the lack of support for this language in Microsoft Visual Studio places it more as an upgrade path for classic ASP using classic JScript than as a new first-class language.

JScript .NET is not supported in the .NET Compact Framework.

Note: JScript .NET versions are not related to classic JScript versions. JScript .NET is a separate product. Even though JScript .NET is not supported within the Visual Studio IDE, its versions are in sync with other .NET languages versions (C#, VB.NET, VC++) that follow their corresponding Visual Studio versions.

.NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 are built on top of 2.0 and do not include the newer JScript.NET release (version 10.0 for .NET Framework 4.0).
