<text>Cozia Monastery, erected close to Călimănești by Mircea the Elder in 1388 and housing his tomb, is one of the most valuable monuments of national medieval art and architecture in Romania.

==History==
The name of the monastery is of Cuman origin and it means &quot;walnut grove&quot;, from Turkic word &quot;koz&quot;, meaning walnut. The original name of the place was the Romanian equivalent, &quot;Nucetul&quot;, but already in 1387, a document of Mircea cel Bătrân uses the current name.

The fortified cloister dates from the foundation (1388) and is the only in Byzantine style preserved in Romania. Two chapels are incorporated in the side toward the Olt River and their Byzantine cupolas are reflected in the water, creating one of the most iconic cultural - natural landmarks in Romania.

The church façades&#x27; decorations with stone rosettes, horizontal Byzantine-style rows of brick and stone and vertical frames are unprecedented in Wallachian architecture and are typical from the Serbian Morava School, which flourished in central Serbia between the 14th century and the 15th century. In fact, the strong resemblance with the Lazarica church indicates that Mircea cel Bătrân employed Serbian craftsmen.

The appearance of the church was modified under Neagoe Basarab (1517), Şerban Cantacuzino and Constantin Brâncoveanu (1707), who added a veranda, a new fountain, a chapel and a watch tower, adding to its architecture the &#x27;brâncovenesc style&#x27;.

Of great value is the hospital church, &#x27;bolnița&#x27; (1543), with original well-preserved indoor frescoes like the votive portrait of ruler Mircea cel Bătrân and his sons.

Cozia was painted between 1390 and 1391. Some of the original frescoes (1390) are still well preserved.

The church of the monastery was put on a Romanian stamp in 1968.

==Museum==

Cozia features a museum of exhibiting old art: old manuscripts and prints, embroideries and objects of worship.

<text>Deluxe Paint, often referred to as &quot;DPaint&quot;, is a bitmap graphics editor created by Dan Silva for Electronic Arts and published for the then-new Amiga 1000 in November 1985. A series of updated versions followed, some of which were ported to other platforms. An MS-DOS release with support for the 256 color VGA standard became popular for creating pixel graphics in video games in the 1990s.

Author Dan Silva previously worked on the &quot;Cut &amp; Paste&quot; word processor (1984), also from Electronic Arts.

== History ==
Deluxe Paint began as an in-house art development tool called Prism. As author Dan Silva added features to Prism, it was developed as a showcase product to coincide with the Amiga&#x27;s debut in 1985. Upon release, it was quickly embraced by the Amiga community and became the de facto graphics (and later animation) editor for the platform. Amiga manufacturer Commodore International later commissioned EA to create version 4.5 AGA to bundle with the new Advanced Graphics Architecture chipset (A1200, A4000) capable Amigas. Version 5 was the last release after Commodore&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1994.

Early versions of Deluxe Paint were available in protected and non copy-protected versions, the latter retailing for a slightly higher price. The copy protection scheme was later dropped. Deluxe Paint was first in a series of products from the Electronic Arts Tools group—then later moved to the ICE (for Interactivity, Creativity, and Education) group—which included such Amiga programs as &quot;Deluxe Music Construction Set&quot; (preceded by &quot;Music Construction Set&quot; for the Apple II), &quot;Deluxe Video&quot;, and the &quot;Studio&quot; series of paint programs for the Mac.

With the development of Deluxe Paint, EA introduced the ILBM and ANIM file format standards for graphics. While widely used on the Amiga, these formats never gained widespread end user acceptance on other platforms, but were heavily used by game development companies. Deluxe Paint was used by LucasArts to make graphics for their adventure games such as &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, and the name of a particular filename used to store the main protagonist Guybrush Threepwood was probably at the origin of his peculiar name. One of the main artist developer of the game, Mark Ferrari, in an interview for &quot;The Making of Monkey Island 30th Anniversary Documentary&quot; remembers that &quot;there was a pulldown menu in DPaint called brushes, so character sprites were referred to as brushes&quot;, and the male protagonist was simply &quot;the guy.brush&quot; until the artist Steve Purcell suggested to take the very name &quot;Guybrush&quot;. The author Ron Gilbert remembers that the PC DOS version of the file was named &quot;guybrush.bbm&quot;.

==Versions==
===Amiga===

Deluxe Paint I was released in 1985. A major feature was animation by using color cycling. The Amiga natively supports indexed color, where a pixel&#x27;s color value does not carry any RGB hue information but instead is an index to a color palette (a collection of unique color values). By adjusting the color value in the palette, all pixels with that palette value change simultaneously in the image or animation, creating cyclic movement in the image. In the Christmas demo files on the Deluxe Paint I disk, this kind of animation (which is toggled by pressing the tab key) is used to depict falling snowflakes, a blinking Christmas tree, and a roaring fire in the fireplace.

In 1986, Deluxe Paint II was introduced, which added many convenient features such as pattern and gradient fill, which could be selected by right-clicking on a fill tool. An effects menu with e.g. perspective transformation was also added. The screen format could now be changed from a dedicated selection page.

Deluxe Paint III appeared in 1989 and added support for Extra Halfbrite. New editing modes allowed one to stencil certain colors to protect them, so it is possible to e.g. paint a landscape from front to back, with the foreground protected by a stencil. A major new feature of Deluxe Paint III was the ability to create cel-like animation, and animbrushes (1MB of RAM is needed for animation). These let the user pick up a section of an animation as an &quot;animbrush&quot;, which can then be placed onto the canvas while it animates. Deluxe Paint III was one of the first paint programs to support animbrushes. This is similar to copy and paste, except one can pick up more than one image.

Deluxe Paint IV (introduced in 1991), which did not include Silva as the lead programmer, offered significant new features like non-bitplane-indexed Hold-and-Modify support for creating images with up to 4,096 colors. Animation support was improved by adding a light table, i.e. onion skinning, and AnimBrush morphing. The color mixer was now a HAM region at the bottom of the screen (instead of a floating window as before) and allowed mixing adjacent colors similar to a real palette.

Deluxe Paint 4.5 AGA appeared the following year, addressing the stability issues and providing support for the new A1200 and A4000 AGA machines and a revamped screen mode interface. It appeared in both standalone and Commodore-bundled versions.

The final release, Deluxe Paint V, in 1995, supported true 24-bit RGB images. However, using only the AGA native chipset, the 24-bit RGB color was only held in computer memory, the on-screen image was displayed in HAM8 (18-bit colour).

=== Apple IIGS ===
DeluxePaint II for the Apple IIGS was developed by Brent Iverson and released in 1987.

=== MS-DOS ===
Deluxe Paint II for PC came out in 1988, requiring MS-DOS 2.0 and 640 kB of RAM. It supported CGA, EGA, MCGA, VGA, Hercules and Tandy IBM-compatible PC graphic cards.

Deluxe Paint II Enhanced was released in 1989, requiring MS-DOS 2.11 and 640 kB of RAM.

Deluxe Paint II Enhanced 2.0, released in 1994, was the most successful PC version, and was compatible with ZSoft&#x27;s PC Paintbrush PCX image format file. The MS-DOS conversion was carried out by Brent Iverson and its enhanced features were by Steve Shaw. It supported the CGA, EGA, MCGA and VGA IBM-compatible PC graphic cards, the Hercules, Tandy and Amstrad proprietary video cards and the main of the first Super VGA video cards (manufacturer dependent) modes, enabling it to support up to 800×600 pixel screen resolution with 256 (from 262,144) colors and 1024×768 pixels with 16 colors.

The sister product Deluxe Paint Animation (only for 320×200 pixels and 256 colors) was widely used, especially in the videogame industry.

=== Atari ST ===
Deluxe Paint ST was developed by ArtisTech Development, published by Electronic Arts, and was released in 1990, supporting features such as the STE 4096-color palette and animated graphics.

Features advertised for the Atari ST version includes 3D perspective, design your own fonts, mirror symmetry, multi-color airbrushing &amp; animations, printing up to poster size, split-screen magnification with variable zoom, and working on animations (including multiple animations).

== Workflow ==

&quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot; hotkeys could step through the indexed palette, turning indexed-pixel-painting into a fast two-handed mouse+keys process, and the right mouse button would paint with the background colour (instead of bringing up a context sensitive menu as is common in modern packages)

For example, transparency was obtained as simply as selecting a &quot;background&quot; colour index (a single right click on the palette GUI to change). Colours could be locked from editing by use of a stencil (a list of colour indexes whose pixels should not be altered in the image data). And simple colour-cycling animations could be created using contiguous entries in the palette. It was easy to change the hue and tone of a section of the image by altering the corresponding colours in the palette. (The specific section needed to use a dedicated part of the palette for this technique to work.)

Brushes can be cut from the background by using the box, freehand, or polygon selection tools. They can then be used in the same manner as any other brush or pen. This functionality is simpler to use than the &quot;stamp&quot; tool of Photoshop or Alpha Channels as provided in later programs. Brushes can be rotated and scaled, even in 3D. After a brush is selected, it appears attached to the mouse cursor, providing an exact preview of what will be drawn. This allows precise pixel positioning of brushes, unlike brushes in Photoshop CS3 and lower, which only show an outline.

Animations stored in IFF ANIM format were delta compressed (only the differences between current and previous frames are stored), making animations smaller and faster on playback.

== Reception ==
&quot;Compute!&quot; criticized the documentation of the first release of &quot;DeluxePaint&quot; as inadequate, but stated that &quot;&quot;DeluxePaint&quot; is a visual arts program of immense scope and flexibility&quot;. In later versions the documentation was much improved; for instance &quot;DeluxePaint IV&quot; came with a 300-page manual.

&quot;Deluxe Paint&quot; was a hit for EA. The main line of the series, particularly installments one to three, has won a total of at least nine awards from independent publications and organizations, including three Amiga-specific awards. &quot;Deluxe Paint III&quot; also won Commodore International&#x27;s Enterprise and Vision award in 1990, becoming the first software to win the award, for what the company&#x27;s judges believed to be best utilizing the Amiga&#x27;s graphical capabilities.

Deluxe Paint for Atari ST won multiple awards from the publication: ST Format for &quot;Best Application Software Of 1990&quot; and &quot;Best Art/Graphics Package.&quot;

ST Format&#x27;s Andrew Hutchinson writes, &quot;It (Deluxe Paint) first appeared in November 1985 and soon more than 50 percent of all Amiga owners had a copy of the package. Since then it&#x27;s undergone two revisions, but the current version available for the ST far outstrips all earlier incarnations. It&#x27;s the best version there is!&quot; 

ST Review writes, &quot;Amiga owners have been sniggering for years at basic packages like Neochrome (NEOchrome) and even the mighty Degas (DEGAS (software)), as they tinkered with the enormously successful Deluxe Paint series. Now ST owners have their day.&quot;

Atari ST User&#x27;s Simon Lawson gave Deluxe Paint the magazine&#x27;s highest rating of &quot;Excellent&quot; for both &quot;Features&quot; and &quot;Ease Of Use.&quot;

== Uses ==
&quot;Deluxe Paint&quot; was frequently used for making graphics for home computer games from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, and was used for games such as &quot;Another World&quot;, &quot;Dark Seed&quot;, &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, &quot;Sim City 2000&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;DOOM&quot;, and &quot;Quake&quot;.

The music video for the 2003 single &quot;Move Your Feet&quot; by Danish alternative dance duo Junior Senior was created entirely using the Amiga version of Deluxe Paint by the art collective Shynola.

The webcomic &quot;Unicorn Jelly&quot; by Jennifer Diane Reitz was completed over the course of three years using Deluxe Paint 2, one panel posted every night at midnight.

British author and artist Molly Cutpurse used Deluxe Paint to create the video graphics for the 1989 film &quot;Murder on the Moon&quot;, starring Brigitte Nielsen.

== Legacy ==
After leaving EA in 1989, Silva went on to join the Yost Group, which developed Autodesk&#x27;s 3D Studio.

In 2015, Electronic Arts released via the Computer History Museum the source code of &quot;Deluxe Paint I&quot; for historical reasons.

<text>New Boston is an unincorporated community in Wayne County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Huron Charter Township. As an unincorporated community, New Boston has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own.

New Boston is located close to three divisions of the Huron–Clinton Metroparks system: Lower Huron, Oakwoods, and Willow. The Huron River runs through New Boston. The community has its own post office with the 48164 ZIP Code, which also serves the communities of Waltz and Willow, as well as smaller portions of Sumpter Township to the west and Brownstown Charter Township to the east. The community is served by Huron School District.

==History==
New Boston was first settled in 1827 and was originally called &quot;Catville&quot; after the initials of the proprietor, C. A. Trowbridge. It received a post office with that name in 1860. On March 20, 1868, it was renamed New Boston, after Boston, Massachusetts.

==Transportation==
Interstate 275 passes through the middle of the community with three exits within the New Boston ZIP Code area: Will Carleton Road (exit 8), South Huron Road (exit 11). Clark Road makes the border with the Township of Sumpter, and Sibley Road (exit 13). The Detroit Metropolitan Airport is just north of New Boston in the city of Romulus.

The Waltz Road–Huron River Bridge is a bridge crossing the Huron River just south of the central business district of New Boston.

<text>The 1st Commonwealth Division was the military unit that commanded Commonwealth land forces in the Korean War. The division was a part of the multinational British Commonwealth Forces Korea, with infantry units of the British Army, Canadian Army and Australian Army forming the bulk of the division. Additionally, the New Zealand Army supplied artillery contingents and an Indian medical unit was also attached. As with the &quot;Korean Augmentation To the United States Army&quot; (KATUSA) programme, numerous South Korean troops were seconded to the Commonwealth division to make up numbers under a scheme known as &quot;KATCOM&quot;.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Following the outbreak of the Korean War, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, which was the initial parent formation of Commonwealth army units in Korea, arrived in the peninsula with two British Infantry battalions in August 1950. It was reinforced by the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) in September, and by the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), in February 1951.

The brigade was subsequently re-constituted as the 28th Commonwealth Brigade in April 1951. Meanwhile, in November 1950, the brigade was joined by the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade, and in May 1951 by the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade.

=== Formation ===
In July 1951, the infantry brigades were combined to form the 1st Commonwealth Division, wherein the unit was 58% British forces, 22% Canadian forces, 14% Australian forces, 5% New Zealander forces, and 1% Indian forces.

The 1st Commonwealth Division was part of the US I Corps, which also included the US 1st Cavalry Division, the US 3rd and 25th Infantry Divisions, and the ROK 1st Division. The division occupied the strategically important sector of front on the Jamestown Line, stretching from the Kimpo peninsula on the Yellow Sea coast to a point east of Kumhwa about , and just from the South Korean capital, Seoul.

=== Dissolution ===
It was deactivated in 1954 as part of the demobilisation of forces in Korea in the aftermath of the war, being reduced to a Commonwealth Brigade Group, and from May 1956 until its final withdrawal in August 1957 to a Commonwealth Contingent of battalion strength.

<text>Premier Election Solutions, formerly Diebold Election Systems, Inc. (DESI), was a subsidiary of Diebold that made and sold voting machines.

In 2009, it was sold to competitor ES&amp;S. In 2010, Dominion Voting Systems purchased the primary assets of Premier, including all intellectual property, software, firmware and hardware for Premier&#x27;s current and legacy optical scan, central scan, and touch screen voting systems, and all versions of the GEMS election management system from ES&amp;S.

At the time ES&amp;S spun off the company due to monopoly charges its systems were in use in 1,400 jurisdictions in 33 states and serving nearly 28 million people.

==History==
DESI was run by Bob Urosevich, starting in 1976. In 1979, Bob Urosevich founded, and served as the president (through 1992) of, &quot;American Information Systems&quot;, now known as Election Systems &amp; Software, Inc. (ES&amp;S), becoming a chief competitor to DESI. Todd Urosevich, Bob&#x27;s brother, was vice president, aftermarket sales, of Election Systems &amp; Software, Inc.

In 1995, Bob Urosevich started I-Mark Systems, whose product was a touch screen voting system utilizing a smart card and biometric encryption authorization technology. Global Election Systems, Inc. (GES) acquired I-Mark in 1997, and on 31 July 2000, Bob Urosevich was promoted from Vice President of Sales and Marketing and New Business Development, to president and chief operating officer. On January 22, 2002, Diebold announced the acquisition of GES, then a manufacturer and supplier of electronic voting terminals and solutions. The total purchase price, in stock and cash, was $24.7 million. Global Election Systems subsequently changed its name to Diebold Election Systems, Inc.

===Name change ===
In late 2006, Diebold decided to remove its name from the front of the voting machines in what its spokesperson called &quot;a strategic decision on the part of the corporation&quot;. In August 2007 Diebold Election Systems changed its name to &quot;Premier Election Solutions&quot; (&quot;PES&quot;).

====Acquisition by Election Systems &amp; Software ====
Election Systems &amp; Software (ES&amp;S) acquired Premier Election Solutions on September 3, 2009. ES&amp;S President and CEO Aldo Tesi said combining the two companies would result in better products and services for customers and voters.

==== Acquisition by Dominion ====
Following the acquisition, the Department of Justice and 14 individual states launched investigations into the transaction on antitrust grounds. In March 2010, the Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against ES&amp;S, requiring it to divest voting equipment systems assets it acquired from Premier Election Solutions in order to restore competition. The company sold the assets to Dominion Voting Systems.

Dominion Voting Systems acquired Premier on May 19, 2010. &quot;We are extremely pleased to conclude this transaction, which will restore much-needed competition to the American voting systems market and will allow Dominion to expand its capabilities and operational footprint to every corner of the United States,&quot; said John Poulos, CEO of Dominion. The transaction was approved by the Department of Justice and nine state attorneys general.

==Controversies==
===O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s fundraising===
In August 2003, Walden O&#x27;Dell, chief executive of Diebold, announced that he had been a top fundraiser for President George W. Bush and had sent a get-out-the-funds letter to Ohio Republicans. In the letters he said he was &quot;committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.&quot; Although he clarified his statement as merely a poor choice of words, critics of Diebold and/or the Republican party interpreted this as at minimum an indication of a conflict of interest, at worst implying a risk to the fair counting of ballots. He responded to the critics by pointing out that the company&#x27;s election machines division is run out of Texas by a registered Democrat. Nonetheless, O&#x27;Dell vowed to lower his political profile lest his personal actions harm the company. O&#x27;Dell resigned his post of chairman and chief executive of Diebold on December 12, 2005, following reports that the company was facing securities fraud litigation surrounding charges of insider trading.

===Security and concealment issues===
In January 2003, Diebold Election Systems&#x27; proprietary software, and election files, hardware and software specifications, program files, voting program patches, on its file transfer protocol site, were leaked, later 7 August 2003 leaked to &quot;Wired&quot;.
In 2004, Avi Rubin, a professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University and Technical Director of the Information Security Institute, analyzed the source code used in these voting machines and reported &quot;this voting system is far below even the most minimal security standards applicable in other contexts.&quot; Following the publication of this paper, the State of Maryland hired Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) to perform another analysis of the Diebold voting machines. SAIC concluded &quot;[t]he system, as implemented in policy, procedure, and technology, is at high risk of compromise.&quot;

In January 2004, &quot;RABA Technologies&quot;, a security company in Columbia, Maryland, did a security analysis of the Diebold AccuVote, confirming many of the problems found by Rubin and finding some new vulnerabilities.

In June 2005, the &quot;Tallahassee Democrat&quot; reported that when given access to Diebold optical scan vote-counting computers, Black Box Voting, a nonprofit election watchdog group founded by Bev Harris, hired Finnish computer expert Harri Hursti and conducted a project in which vote totals were altered, by replacing the memory card that stores voting results with one that had been tampered with. Although the machines are supposed to record changes to data stored in the system, they showed no record of tampering after the memory cards were swapped. In response, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of State said, &quot;Information on a blog site is not viable or credible.&quot;

In early 2006, a study for the state of California corroborated and expanded on the problem; on page 2 the California report states that:

&quot;Memory card attacks are a real threat: We determined that anyone who has access to a memory card of the AV-OS, and can tamper it (i.e. modify its contents), and can have the modified cards used in a voting machine during election, can indeed modify the election results from that machine in a number of ways. The fact that the results are incorrect cannot be detected except by a recount of the original paper ballots&quot; and &quot;Harri Hursti&#x27;s attack does work: Mr. Hursti&#x27;s attack on the AV-OS is definitely real. He was indeed able to change the election results by doing nothing more than modifying the contents of a memory card. He needed no passwords, no cryptographic keys, and no access to any other part of the voting system, including the GEMS election management server.&quot;
A new vulnerability, this time with the TSx DRE machines, was reported in May 2006. According to Professor Rubin, the machines are &quot;much, much easier to attack than anything we&#x27;ve previously said... On a scale of one to 10, if the problems we found before were a six, this is a 10. It&#x27;s a totally different ballgame.&quot; According to Rubin, the system is intentionally designed so that anyone with access can update the machine software, without a pass code or other security protocol. Diebold officials said that although any problem can be avoided by keeping a close watch on the machines, they are developing a fix.

Michael I. Shamos, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University who is a proponent of electronic voting and the examiner of electronic voting systems for Pennsylvania, stated &quot;It&#x27;s the most severe security flaw ever discovered in a voting system.&quot; Douglas W. Jones, a professor of computer science at the University of Iowa, stated &quot;This is the barn door being wide open, while people were arguing over the lock on the front door.&quot; Diebold spokesman David Bear played down the seriousness of the situation, asserting that &quot;For there to be a problem here, you&#x27;re basically assuming a premise where you have some evil and nefarious election officials who would sneak in and introduce a piece of software. I don&#x27;t believe these evil elections people exist.&quot;

On October 30, 2006, researchers from the University of Connecticut demonstrated new vulnerabilities in Diebold AccuVote-OS optical scan voting terminal. The system can be compromised even if its removable memory card is sealed in place.

On September 13, 2006, Director of the &quot;Center for Information and Technology Policy&quot; at Princeton University, Professor Edward Felten, and graduate students Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman discovered severe security flaws in a Diebold AccuVote-TS voting machine. Their findings claimed, &quot;Malicious software running on a single voting machine can steal votes with little if any risk of detection. The malicious software can modify all of the records, audit logs, and counters kept by the voting machine, so that even careful forensic examination of these records will find nothing amiss.&quot;

On November 2, 2006, HBO premiered &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot;, a documentary about the vulnerability of electronic voting machines (primarily Diebold) to hacking and inaccurate vote totals. The company argued that the film was factually inaccurate and urged HBO to air a disclaimer explaining that it had not verified any of the claims. However, corroboration and validation for the exploits shown in &quot;Hacking Democracy&quot; was published in a report for the state of California (see above).

In January 2007, a photo of the key used to open Diebold voting machines was posted in the company&#x27;s website. It was found possible to duplicate the key based on the photo. The key unlocks a compartment which contains a removable memory card, leaving the machine vulnerable to tampering.

A report commissioned by Ohio&#x27;s top elections official on December 15, 2007, found that all five voting systems used in Ohio (made by Elections Systems and Software; Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold Election Systems); and Hart InterCivic) have critical flaws that could undermine the integrity of the 2008 general election.

On July 17, 2008, Stephen Spoonamore made the claim that he had &quot;fresh evidence regarding election fraud on Diebold electronic voting machines during the 2002 Georgia gubernatorial and senatorial elections.&quot; Spoonamore is &quot;the founder and until recently the CEO of Cybrinth LLC, an information technology policy and security firm that serves Fortune 100 companies.&quot; He claims that Diebold Election Systems Inc. COO Bob Urosevich personally installed a computer patch on voting machines in two counties in Georgia, and that the patch did not fix the problem it was supposed to fix. Reports have indicated that then Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox did not know the patch was installed until after the election.

===States rejecting Diebold===
In 2004, after an initial investigation into the company&#x27;s practices, Secretary of State of California Kevin Shelley issued a ban on one model of Diebold voting machines in that state. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, joined the state of California into a false claims suit filed in November 2003 by Bev Harris and Alameda County citizen Jim March.

The suit charged that Diebold had given false information about the security and reliability of Diebold Election Systems machines that were sold to the state. To settle the case, Diebold agreed to pay $2.6 million and to implement certain reforms. On August 3, 2007, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen decertified Diebold and three other electronic voting systems after a &quot;top-to-bottom review of the voting machines certified for use in California in March 2007.&quot;

In April 2007, the Maryland General Assembly voted to replace paperless touchscreen voting machines with paper ballots counted by optical scanners, effective in time for the 2010 general (November) elections. The law, signed by the Governor in May 2007, was made contingent on the provision of funding by no later than April 2008. The Governor included such funding in his proposed budget in January 2008, but the funding was defeated by the state House in July 2008.

In March 2009, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen decertified Diebold&#x27;s GEMS version 1.18.19 after the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project discovered that GEMS had silently dropped 197 ballots from its tabulation of a single precinct in Eureka, California. The discovery was made after project members conducted an independent count using the ballot counting program Ballot Browser.

===Leaked memos===
In September 2003, a large number of internal Diebold memos, dating back to 1999, were posted to the BlackBoxVoting.org web site, resulting in the site being shut down due to a Diebold cease and desist order. Later, other website organizations Why War? and the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons, a group of student activists at Swarthmore College posted the memos. U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich, a Democrat from Ohio, placed portions of the files on his websites.

Diebold attempted to stop the publication of these internal memos by sending cease-and-desist letters to each site hosting these documents, demanding that they be removed. Diebold claimed the memos as their copyrighted material, and asserted that anyone who published the memos online was in violation of the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act found in §512 of the United States Copyright Act.

When it turned out that some of the challenged groups would not back down, Diebold retracted their threat. Those who had been threatened by Diebold then sued for court costs and damages, in &quot;OPG v. Diebold&quot;. This suit eventually led to a victory for the plaintiffs against Diebold, when in October 2004 Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled that Diebold abused its copyrights in its efforts to suppress the embarrassing memos.

===Stephen Heller===
In January and February 2004, a whistleblower named Stephen Heller brought to light memos from Jones Day, Diebold&#x27;s attorneys, informing Diebold that they were in breach of California law by continuing to use illegal and uncertified software in California voting machines. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed civil and criminal suits against the company, which were dropped when Diebold settled out of court for $2.6 million. In February 2006, Heller was charged with three felonies for this action. On November 20, 2006, Heller made a plea agreement to pay $10,000 to Jones Day, write an apology, and receive three years probation.

===Diebold and Kenneth Blackwell&#x27;s conflict of interest===
Ohio State Senator Jeff Jacobson, Republican, asked Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, also a Republican, in July 2003 to disqualify Diebold&#x27;s bid to supply voting machines for the state, after security problems were discovered in its software, but was refused. Blackwell had ordered Diebold touch screen voting machines, reversing an earlier decision by the state to purchase only optical scan voting machines which, unlike the touch screen devices, would leave a &quot;paper trail&quot; for recount purposes. Blackwell was found, in April 2006, to own 83 shares of Diebold stock, down from 178 shares purchased in January 2005, which he attributed to an unidentified financial manager at Credit Suisse First Boston who had violated his instructions to avoid potential conflict of interest, without his knowledge. When Cuyahoga county&#x27;s primary was held on May 2, 2006, officials ordered the hand-counting of more than 18,000 paper ballots after Diebold&#x27;s new optical scan machines produced inconsistent tabulations, leaving several local races in limbo for days and eventually resulting in a reversal of the outcome of one race for state representative. Blackwell ordered an investigation by the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections; Ohio Democrats demanded that Blackwell, who was also the Republican gubernatorial candidate in 2006, recuse himself from the investigation due to conflicts of interest, but Blackwell did not do so.

The Republican head of the Franklin County, Ohio Board of Elections, Matt Damschroder, said a Diebold contractor came to him and bragged of a $50,000 check he had written to Blackwell&#x27;s &quot;political interests.&quot;

<text>Wikiquote is part of a family of wiki-based projects run by the Wikimedia Foundation using MediaWiki software. The project&#x27;s objective is to collaboratively produce a vast reference of quotations from prominent people, books, films, proverbs, etc. and writings about them. The website aims to be as accurate as possible regarding the provenance and sourcing of the quotations.

Initially, the project operated only in English from July 2003, expanding to include other languages in July 2004. As of 2025, there are active Wikiquote sites for languages comprising a total of articles and recently active editors.

== History ==
The Wikiquote site originated in 2003. The article creation milestones are taken from WikiStats.

==Operation==
Wikiquote is one of few online quotation collections that provides the opportunity for visitors to contribute and the very few which strive to provide exact sources for each quotation as well as corrections of misattributed quotations. Wikiquote pages are cross-linked to articles about the notable personalities on Wikipedia.

== Multi-lingual cooperation ==
As of 2025, there are Wikiquote sites for languages of which are active and are closed. The active sites have articles and the closed sites have articles. There are registered users of which are recently active.

The top ten Wikiquote language projects by mainspace article count:

For a complete list with totals see Wikimedia Statistics: 

==Use in experiments==
It can be possible to utilise Wikiquote as a text corpus for language experiments.
The University of Wroclaw team entering Conversational Intelligence Challenge of the 2017 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017) used Wikiquote to produce a conversational talker module for extraction of rare words.
Researchers have used Wikiquote to train language models to detect extremist quotes.

==Reception==
Wikiquote has been suggested as &quot;a great starting point for a quotation search&quot; with only quotes with sourced citations being available. It is also noted as a source from frequent misquotes and their possible origins. It can be used for analysis to produce claims such as &quot;Albert Einstein is probably the most quoted figure of our time&quot;.

<text>Tomson Highway (born 6 December 1951) is an Indigenous Canadian playwright, novelist, children&#x27;s author and musician. He is best known for his plays &quot;The Rez Sisters&quot; and &quot;Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing&quot;, both of which won the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding New Play and the Floyd S. Chalmers Award.

Highway also published a novel, &quot;Kiss of the Fur Queen&quot; (1998), which is based on the events that led to his brother René Highway&#x27;s death of AIDS. He wrote the libretto for the first Cree language opera, &quot;The Journey or Pimooteewin&quot;.

==Biography==

Tomson Highway was born on 6 December 1951 in northwestern Manitoba to Pelagie Cook and Joe Highway, a caribou hunter and champion dogsled racer. Cree is his first language and he was raised according to Cree tradition before being sent to residential school. He is related to actor/playwright Billy Merasty.

When he was six, Tomson&#x27;s father voluntarily enrolled him at Guy Hill Indian Residential School. Until he was fifteen, he was allowed to return home only during the summer months.

Some children who attended residential schools later reported abuse. Highway has said that &quot;Nine of the happiest years of my life I spent it at that school,&quot; crediting it with teaching him English and to play piano. He has said that &quot;There are many very successful people today that went to those schools and have brilliant careers and are very functional people, very happy people like myself. I have a thriving international career, and it wouldn&#x27;t have happened without that school.&quot;

He obtained his B.A. in Honours Music in 1975 and his B.A. in English in 1976, both from the University of Western Ontario. While working on his degree, he met playwright James Reaney. For seven years, Highway worked as a social worker on First Nations reserves across Canada. He also was involved in creating and organizing several Indigenous music and arts festivals.

Drawing from these experiences, he has written novels and plays that have won him widespread recognition across Canada and around the world.

In 1986, Highway published &quot;The Rez Sisters&quot;, which won multiple awards in productions across Canada. It also went to the Edinburgh International Festival in 1988. In 1989, he published &quot;Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing&quot;, which was the first Canadian play to receive a full production at Toronto&#x27;s Royal Alexandra Theatre.

Both of these plays explore the community on a fictional First Nation reserve of Wasychigan Hill on Manitoulin Island. &quot;The Rez Sisters&quot; depicts seven women of the community planning a trip to the &quot;BIGGEST BINGO IN THE WORLD&quot; in Toronto and features a male trickster, called Nanabush. &quot;Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing&quot; depicts the men&#x27;s interest in ice hockey and features a female trickster. &quot;Rose&quot;, written in 2000, is the third play in the heptalogy, featuring characters from each of the previous plays.

Highway was artistic director of Native Earth Performing Arts in Toronto from 1986 to 1992, as well as De-ba-jeh-mu-jig theatre group in Wikwemikong.

Frustrated with difficulties presented by play production, Highway wrote a novel called &quot;Kiss of the Fur Queen&quot;. The novel presents an uncompromising portrait of the sexual abuse of Native children in residential schools and its traumatic consequences. &quot;Kiss of the Fur Queen&quot; has won a number of awards and spent several weeks on top of Canadian bestseller lists.

After a hiatus from playwriting, Highway wrote &quot;Ernestine Shuswap Gets Her Trout&quot; in 2005. Set in 1910, the play revolves around the visit of the &quot;Big Kahoona of Canada&quot; (then Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier) to the Thompson River Valley.

In 2010, Highway re-published &quot;The Rez Sisters&quot; and &quot;Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing&quot; in a Cree-language edition. Highway said that &quot;the Cree versions [...] are actually the original versions. As it turns out, the original ones that came out 20 years ago were the translation.&quot;

His musical &quot;The (Post) Mistress&quot; premiered in 2009 as a cabaret titled &quot;Kisageetin&quot;. It was developed as a full musical, which has since been staged across Canada in both English and French versions. A soundtrack album for the musical was released in 2014; it garnered a Juno Award nomination for Aboriginal Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2015.

In 2022 &quot;Cree Country&quot;, an album of original Cree-language country songs written by Highway and sung by his frequent collaborator Patricia Cano, was released.

Highway divides his time between residences in Gatineau, Québec, in France and in Italy with his life partner Raymond Lalonde.

==Awards and recognition==

Highway has been awarded nine honorary degrees, from Brandon University, the University of Winnipeg, the University of Western Ontario (London), the University of Windsor, Laurentian University (Sudbury, Ontario), Lakehead University (Thunder Bay, Ontario), l&#x27;Universite de Montreal, University of Manitoba, and the University of Toronto. In addition, he holds two &quot;equivalents&quot; of such honours: from The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto and The National Theatre School in Montreal.

In 1994, he was made a member of the Order of Canada. In 1998, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; named him as one of the &#x27;100 most important people in Canadian history&#x27;. In 2001, he received a National Indigenous Achievement Award, now the Indspire Awards, in the field of arts and culture.

Although Highway is considered one of Canada&#x27;s most important playwrights, in recent years both theatre critics and Highway have noted a significant gap between his reputation and the relative infrequency of his plays being produced by theatre companies. According to Highway, theatres frequently face or perceive difficulty in finding a suitable cast of First Nations actors, but are reluctant to risk casting non-Indigenous performers due to their sensitivity to being accused of cultural appropriation. He believes that such companies simply pass over his plays instead.

In 2011, director Ken Gass mounted a production of &quot;The Rez Sisters&quot; at Toronto&#x27;s Factory Theatre. As part of an ongoing research project into the effects of colour-blind casting on theatre, he staged two readings of the play — one with an exclusively First Nations cast and one with a colour-blind cast of actors from a variety of racial backgrounds — before mounting a full colour-blind stage production.

His memoir &quot;Permanent Astonishment&quot; was the winner of the 2021 Hilary Weston Writers&#x27; Trust Prize for Nonfiction.

Highway gave the 2022 Massey Lecture.

<text>The Ziegfeld Follies were a series of elaborate theatrical revue productions on Broadway in New York City from 1907 to 1931, with renewals in 1934, 1936, 1943, and 1957. They became a radio program in 1932 and 1936 as &quot;The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air&quot;.

==Founding and history==

Inspired by the Folies Bergère of Paris, the Ziegfeld Follies were conceived and mounted by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., reportedly at the suggestion of his then-wife, the actress and singer Anna Held. The shows&#x27; producers were turn-of-the-twentieth-century producing titans Klaw and Erlanger.

The Follies were a series of lavish revues, something between later Broadway shows and the more elaborate high-class vaudeville and variety show. The first follies, &quot;The Follies of 1907&quot;, was produced that year at the &quot;Jardin de Paris&quot; roof theatre.

During the Follies era, many of the top entertainers, including W. C. Fields, Eddie Cantor, Josephine Baker, Fanny Brice, Ann Pennington, Bert Williams, Eva Tanguay, Bob Hope, Will Rogers, Ruth Etting, Ray Bolger, Helen Morgan, Louise Brooks, Marilyn Miller, Ed Wynn, Gilda Gray, Nora Bayes and Sophie Tucker appeared in the shows.

The Ziegfeld Follies were known for displaying beautiful chorus girls, commonly called Ziegfeld Girls, who &quot;paraded up and down flights of stairs as anything from birds to battleships.&quot; They usually wore elaborate costumes by designers such as Erté, Lady Duff-Gordon and Ben Ali Haggin. The &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; used in the revues were designed by Ben Ali Haggin from 1917 to 1925. Joseph Urban was the scenic designer for the &quot;Follies&quot; shows, starting in 1915, and Edward Royce directed the &quot;Follies&quot; in 1920 and 1921, in addition to several other Ziegfeld productions.

After Ziegfeld&#x27;s death his widow, actress Billie Burke, authorized use of his name for Ziegfeld Follies in 1934 and 1936 to Jake Shubert, who then produced the Follies. The name was later used by other promoters in New York City, Philadelphia, and again on Broadway, with less connection to the original Follies. These later efforts failed miserably. When the show toured, the 1934 edition was recorded in its entirety, from the overture to play-out music, on a series of 78 rpm discs, which were edited by the record producer David Cunard to form an album of the highlights of the production and which was released as a CD in 1997.

==Productions based on the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;==
In 1937, at the 9th Academy Awards, the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; produced the previous year won the Best Picture (called &quot;Outstanding Production&quot;), starring William Powell as Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. and co-starring Myrna Loy (as Ziegfeld&#x27;s second wife Billie Burke), Luise Rainer (as Anna Held, which won her an Academy Award for Best Actress), and Frank Morgan as Jack Billings. Featuring numbers by Ray Bolger, Dennis Morgan, Virginia Bruce, and Harriet Hoctor, the film gave a glimpse into what the Follies were really like. The show-stopper was the Irving Berlin-composed &quot;A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody&quot;, which, by itself, cost more to produce than one of Ziegfeld&#x27;s entire stage shows.

In 1941 MGM released &quot;Ziegfeld Girl&quot;, starring Judy Garland, Lana Turner, Hedy Lamarr, James Stewart and Tony Martin. The film was set in the 1920s. Celebrated numbers from Ziegfeld Revues were recreated, including the famed &quot;Wedding Cake&quot; set which had been used for Metro&#x27;s earlier film, &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot;. Judy Garland was filmed on the top of the cake. Charles Winninger, who had performed in the Follies of 1920, appeared as &quot;Ed Gallagher&quot; with Gallagher&#x27;s real-life partner, Al Shean to recreate the duo&#x27;s famous song &quot;Mister Gallagher and Mister Shean&quot;. According to modern sources, Turner&#x27;s character was modeled after Ziegfeld Girl Lillian Lorraine, who suffered a drunken fall into the orchestra pit during an extravagant number.

In 1946 MGM released a third feature film based on Ziegfeld&#x27;s shows titled &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; with Fred Astaire, Judy Garland, Lena Horne, William Powell (as Ziegfeld), Gene Kelly, Fanny Brice, Red Skelton, Esther Williams, Cyd Charisse, Lucille Ball, Kathryn Grayson, and others performing songs and sketches similar to those from the original Follies. &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; was awarded the &quot;Grand Prix de la Comedie Musicale&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival in 1947, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration (black and white).

The stage musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot; depicts Fanny Brice&#x27;s success with the Follies. The musical debuted on Broadway in 1964 with Barbra Streisand playing Brice, Roger DeKoven as Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. and Brice&#x27;s son-in-law Ray Stark producing. The 1968 Columbia Pictures film adaptation featuring Streisand reprising her role as Brice and Walter Pidgeon as Ziegfeld was the year&#x27;s top-grossing movie. A subsequent Broadway revival in 2022 and 2023 featured Beanie Feldstein and later Lea Michele as Brice and Peter Francis James as Ziegfeld.

==Ziegfeld girls and other Ziegfeld performers==
==Legacy==
The 1971 Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Follies&quot; takes place at a reunion of showgirls from the &quot;Weissman Follies&quot;, a fictional revue inspired by the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. In addition to featuring &quot;ghosts&quot; of statuesque showgirls from the heyday of the revues, the musical includes many songs and production numbers that are intended to evoke the types of entertainment typically featured in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; and other revues of the period. Examples include parade of showgirls (&quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;); a torch song (&quot;Losing My Mind&quot;); a baggy pants comic song (&quot;The God-Why-Don&#x27;t-You-Love-Me Blues&quot;); and a novelty song (&quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;). In &quot;The Drowsy Chaperone&quot;, the character Victor Feldzieg is the producer of &quot;Feldzieg&#x27;s Follies&quot;, a parody of &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. 

The TV show &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, about crime and corruption in 1920s Atlantic City, New Jersey, features a character that is a former &quot;Follies&quot; dancer, Lucy Danzige, portrayed by Paz de la Huerta.

The 1912 version of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; included a song titled &#x27;&quot;Row, Row, Row&quot;&#x27;, the tune of which has been adapted by football clubs in Brazil&lt;ref name=&quot;ge.globo/hino-do-america-da-ufrj&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia, where Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Herald Sun&quot; ranked one of these adaptations, &quot;We&#x27;re from Tigerland&quot;, as the best Australian Football League club song.

<doc id="264648" wikidata="Q912542" url="?curid=264648" title="Brian Lenihan Snr">
<text>Brian Patrick Lenihan (17 November 1930 – 1 November 1995) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Tánaiste from 1987 to 1990, Minister for Defence from 1989 to 1990, Minister for Agriculture from March 1982 to December 1982, Minister for Fisheries from 1977 to 1979, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1987 to 1989, 1979 to 1981 and January 1973 to March 1973, Minister for Transport and Power from 1969 to 1973, Minister for Education from 1968 to 1969, Minister for Justice from 1964 to 1969, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands from 1961 to 1964. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1961 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1995. He served as a Senator for the Industrial and Commercial Panel from 1957 to 1961 and 1973 to 1977. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Oireachtas from 1973 to 1977.

He was a member of a family political dynasty; his father, Patrick Lenihan, and sister both followed him into Dáil Éireann; his sister Mary O&#x27;Rourke sitting in cabinet with him. Two of his sons, Brian Lenihan Jnr and Conor Lenihan, became TDs in the 1990s. Brian Lenihan Jnr served as Minister for Finance and Conor was Minister of State in the government of Taoiseach Brian Cowen. Two phrases associated with Lenihan Snr, &quot;No problem&quot; and &quot;On mature recollection&quot;, entered the Irish political lexicon.

==Early life==
Born in Dundalk, County Louth, Lenihan was the son of Patrick Lenihan and Anne Scanlon. His father had been active in the Irish Republican Army, which saw action during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. He had been an admirer of Michael Collins and took the pro-Treaty side in 1922, before later returning to his studies and qualifying as a teacher.

Lenihan, who was one of five children, grew up in Athlone. He was educated at Marist College in the town before later studying law at University College Dublin (UCD), where he was actively involved in the Law Society as a Committee Member, and also played football for UCD, scoring against Sligo Rovers in the 1952–1953 FAI Cup. He later qualified as a barrister from King&#x27;s Inns. He then practised law for a few years before becoming a full-time politician.

==Political career==
===Beginnings===
Lenihan first entered politics in 1954, when he ran as a Fianna Fáil candidate in Longford–Westmeath in that year&#x27;s general election. Of the four Fianna Fáil candidates, Lenihan was the only one not to be elected.

Three years later Lenihan contested the 1957 general election, this time in the Roscommon constituency. Although he received more first preferences than any of the other Fianna Fáil candidates, he lost out on a Dáil seat once again. In spite of this, he was elected to the Seanad for the Industrial and Commercial Panel in 1957

After four years as a senator, Lenihan finally secured a seat in Dáil Éireann, following his success at the 1961 general election in Roscommon. He had the distinction of being made a Parliamentary Secretary on his first day in the Dáil as a TD, serving under both Minister for Lands Mícheál Ó Móráin and Minister for Justice Charles Haughey.

===Minister for Justice===
A cabinet reshuffle saw Lenihan join the cabinet of Seán Lemass in 1964, as Minister for Justice. His predecessor in the office, Charles Haughey, systematically reviewed, repealed or amended Acts dating back 700 years in the single largest reform of the Irish civil and criminal code ever undertaken. Lenihan carried the legislative programme, covering everything from repealing mediæval laws to granting succession rights to married women. As Minister, it was Lenihan who repealed Ireland&#x27;s notorious censorship laws. Controversially he also suggested that Ireland should rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations, though it is unclear whether that suggestion actually reflected &quot;his&quot; opinion or whether he was simply raising the issue at Lemass&#x27;s request to gauge public reaction.

===Minister for Education===
In 1968, Lemass&#x27;s successor Jack Lynch appointed Lenihan as Minister for Education. As Minister, he controversially proposed the merger of Dublin&#x27;s (then) two universities, Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and University College Dublin (UCD). The scheme was abandoned after mass opposition, Lenihan famously being forced to flee student protests in Trinity through a toilet window. Lenihan was also Minister during a 19-day secondary teachers&#x27; strike in February 1969.

===Minister for Transport and Power===
Following the 1969 general election, Fianna Fáil returned to power for a fourth successive term of office. Lenihan had hopes of further promotion within the cabinet, however, his appointment as Minister for Transport and Power was largely seen as a demotion.

===Minister for Foreign Affairs===
In 1973, Patrick Hillery was appointed as Ireland&#x27;s European Commissioner, upon the Irish entry to the European Economic Community. Lenihan then finally secured his much sought-after portfolio, that of Minister for Foreign Affairs. His tenure was short-lived, as the government fell and a new Fine Gael-Labour Party government took office, following the 1973 general election.

==Political return==
Lenihan also dramatically lost his Roscommon–Leitrim seat. He once again became a Senator, becoming his party&#x27;s leader in the upper house. In 1973, he was appointed a member of the second delegation from the Oireachtas to the European Parliament.

He moved his political base from rural Roscommon to Dublin West, where he was elected as a TD at the 1977 general election, which saw a landslide victory for Fianna Fáil. Jack Lynch appointed him Minister for Forestry and Fisheries.

At Lynch&#x27;s retirement in 1979, Fianna Fáil saw a leadership battle between Charles Haughey (the radical republican candidate) and George Colley (the party establishment candidate and mild republican). Lenihan dismissed the choice as being between a &quot;knave and a fool&quot;. He also described himself as being the &quot;x in &quot;Oxo&quot;&quot;. He was believed to have backed Colley. Years later he claimed he had actually supported Haughey, but not everyone accepted this assertion.

Haughey, seeking to weaken the faction supporting Colley, appointed Lenihan as Minister for Foreign Affairs, a post he held until Fianna Fáil lost power in 1981. His period in Foreign Affairs was overshadowed by a comment made after an Anglo-Irish summit between Haughey and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, when he spoke of Britain and Ireland being able to bring about Irish unity within ten years, a comment which infuriated the British and Northern Ireland unionists and which undid much of the goodwill achieved by the summit. His comments, at a time of major problems within Northern Ireland, with the Provisional IRA and Irish National Liberation Army campaigns in full swing along with Ulster Defence Association and other loyalists conducting reprisals were widely criticised in the Irish media as insensitive, especially as Irish unity had not even been on the agenda of the summit. One newspaper columnist commented simply &quot;there goes Brian, pointlessly talking himself into trouble again&quot;. In 1982, when Fianna Fáil regained power for what would prove only ten months, Lenihan was appointed Minister for Agriculture, the announcement in the Dáil being greeted by a sustained round of laughter on the opposition benches.

==Anglo-Irish Agreement opposition==
In opposition, Lenihan and Haughey attracted some international criticism when, against the advice of senior Irish-American politicians Senator Edward Kennedy and Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill, they campaigned against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which the government of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had signed with the British government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The agreement gave Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. In 1987, Fianna Fáil returned to power and Lenihan was for the third and final time appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the additional post of Tánaiste (deputy prime minister). In power Haughey and Lenihan reversed their opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Lenihan attending meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference which the Ireland&#x27;s Foreign Minister and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland co-chaired.

==Liver transplant==
Lenihan&#x27;s last period as Minister for Foreign Affairs was overshadowed by his serious ill-health. A long-standing liver problem had developed into a life-threatening issue requiring a liver transplant. Lenihan, previously a large-framed man, had been reduced to a bone-thin jaundiced-looking shadow of his former self, so ill-looking that the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, said afterwards that on seeing Brian at an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting, he had speculated as to whether Lenihan would die at the meeting. In May 1989, Lenihan underwent the liver transplant at Mayo Clinic in the United States. In his absence he was re-elected to the Dáil in the 1989 general election for Dublin West, after which, while remaining Tánaiste, he was made Minister for Defence. Lenihan returned to Irish politics with a new lease of life. When he entered the Dáil chamber he received an ovation, an indication of his personal cross-party popularity.

It was revealed subsequently that Lenihan&#x27;s operation was partly paid for through fundraising by Taoiseach Charles Haughey, from businessmen with Fianna Fáil links. In evidence to the Moriarty Tribunal investigating Haughey&#x27;s finances, it was established that much of the money raised but not ultimately needed for the operation was redirected by Haughey into his own personal bank account. Haughey was revealed in the 2006 tribunal report to have been engaged in numerous acts of corruption, to finance a lifestyle considerably in excess of his earnings as a politician.

==Presidential candidate==
In January 1990, leaks to the media suggested that Lenihan was considering seeking the Fianna Fáil nomination in the 1990 presidential election, which was due in November 1990. Speculation abounded that this was part of a plan to discourage other parties from running candidates in the belief that Lenihan would prove unbeatable and so get the office unopposed. Labour Party leader Dick Spring indicated that Labour would run a candidate for the presidency, even if he had to stand himself. Ultimately, Labour chose former Senator Mary Robinson as its candidate.

Lenihan was generally perceived as an unbeatable candidate, though he did receive a late challenge for the nomination from cabinet colleague John Wilson. However, in September 1990, Lenihan was formally nominated as his party&#x27;s candidate. The main opposition party, Fine Gael chose Austin Currie, a TD and former Northern Ireland cabinet minister, to be its candidate.

===The Lenihan tape===

The issue of Lenihan&#x27;s trustworthiness became the central issue of the second half of the presidential campaign.

In January 1982, Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had asked President Patrick Hillery, a former government colleague of Lenihan&#x27;s, to dissolve the Dáil, a request which Hillery granted. If President Hillery had refused a dissolution, Charles Haughey as Leader of the Opposition, could have formed an alternative government and strengthened his own embattled position as leader of Fianna Fáil. Subsequently, it was reported in books by authors Stephen O&#x27;Byrnes and Raymond Smith, and by many political journalists in newspaper articles (some of whom had Lenihan as their source) that Lenihan had been one of the people who had made phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin, the President&#x27;s official residence, on the night in question, in order to persuade or pressure Hillery to refuse a dissolution. Lenihan himself never denied his involvement in the incident. Indeed, in May 1990, he confirmed his participation in an on-the-record interview with a postgraduate student and journalist, Jim Duffy. In September 1990, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; carried a series of articles on the presidency, one of which mentioned in passing the role of Lenihan, Sylvester Barrett, and Charles Haughey in making the calls. The article in question was sourced from Duffy&#x27;s interview.

In October 1990, in the midst of the presidential election, Lenihan suddenly changed his account. In an interview in the &quot;Irish Press&quot; and on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; programme, he insisted that he had had &quot;no hand, act or part&quot; in efforts to pressure President Hillery. The &quot;Irish Times&quot;, which was aware that Lenihan himself was Duffy&#x27;s source for the original article claim, published, with Duffy&#x27;s agreement, a newspaper story confirming that Lenihan had indeed made the controversial phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin. When Lenihan&#x27;s campaign manager, Bertie Ahern, named Duffy on radio as someone who had interviewed Lenihan back in May, a political storm erupted in which the journalist was put under siege by the media and Fianna Fáil, leading to his reluctant decision, after consulting with lawyers, to release the portion of the tape in which Lenihan talked about the events of January 1982.

===&quot;On mature recollection&quot;===

Lenihan&#x27;s reaction severely damaged his credibility. He appeared on a live TV news bulletin, and, looking into the camera, pleaded with the Irish people to believe him, stating that &quot;on mature recollection&quot; he had not phoned President Hillery and his account to Duffy had been wrong. He then requested an audience with President Hillery to seek his confirmation that he made no phone calls. No audience was granted, and his campaign manager Bertie Ahern withdrew the request – though, in a sign of the chaos enveloping the campaign, Lenihan told journalist Charlie Bird that the request was still there until the journalist played back his interview with Ahern, after which Lenihan recorded a new soundbite explaining why the request had been withdrawn.

At this point, the opposition put down a motion of no confidence in the government. The Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil&#x27;s coalition partner, told Taoiseach Charles Haughey that unless Lenihan was either dismissed or an inquiry set up into the events of January 1982, it would pull out of government, support the opposition motion and force a general election. Though insisting that he would put no pressure on Brian Lenihan, &quot;my friend of thirty years&quot;, Haughey drew up a letter of resignation for Lenihan&#x27;s signature. Lenihan refused to sign, and Haughey formally advised President Hillery to dismiss Lenihan from the government – which Hillery, as was required constitutionally, duly did, despite grave personal concerns. Many in Fianna Fáil were disgusted with what they saw as Haughey&#x27;s betrayal of his old friend, and argued that the Progressive Democrats&#x27; threat to bring down the government was a mere bluff. This would be the first in a series of events generating discontent in Fianna Fáil with Haughey&#x27;s leadership, culminating in his downfall in early 1992.

===Pádraig Flynn&#x27;s attack on Mary Robinson===

Lenihan&#x27;s dismissal led to an immediate collapse in his popularity (from mid 40% to 31% almost overnight), though his standing in the polls subsequently improved. A personal attack by former cabinet colleague Pádraig Flynn on Mary Robinson, in which he accused her of showing a &quot;new-found interest&quot; in her family, backfired and destroyed Lenihan&#x27;s campaign. Women voters rallied to Robinson and abandoned the Lenihan campaign in droves.

===The result===
In spite of his troubled campaign, Lenihan won the largest number of first-preference votes. However, most of the votes that initially went to Austin Currie, the third-placed candidate, transferred to Mary Robinson on the second count, in what was widely seen as a pact between Fine Gael and the Labour Party. As a result, Lenihan became the first Fianna Fáil candidate to lose an Irish presidential election.

==Out of government==
Lenihan remained active in politics right up to his death in 1995. Bitter at what he saw as his betrayal by the Progressive Democrats, he campaigned for Fianna Fáil to go into coalition with the Labour Party instead, something which happened after the 1992 general election. He also occasionally reviewed books, which showed an intellect that he had suppressed in his public persona as a politician.

==Death==
Brian Lenihan&#x27;s health again deteriorated and he died in 1995, at the age of 64. The resulting by-election was won by his son Brian Lenihan Jnr.

In the 1997 general election another son, Conor Lenihan, was elected to Dáil Éireann.

==Brian Lenihan Memorial Lecture==
A Brian Lenihan Memorial Lecture is delivered annually in the Irish Institute of European Affairs. The first guest speaker was the late Lord Jenkins of Hillhead (previously known as Roy Jenkins; formerly British Home Secretary and President of the European Commission). In 2001, the lecture was given by Chris Patten, former British Conservative Party Minister and MP, former Governor of Hong Kong and current British European Commissioner.

<text>This Was is the debut studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, released in October 1968. Recorded at a cost of £1200, it is the only Jethro Tull album with guitarist Mick Abrahams, who was a major influence for the sound and music style of the band&#x27;s first songs. When the album was released the band were performing regularly at the Marquee Club in London, where other successful British groups, such as the Rolling Stones and the Who, had started their careers.

Compared to the band&#x27;s later discography, &quot;This Was&quot; contains significant blues rock and jazz fusion influences, owing to Abrahams&#x27; songwriting and playing style. The band would soon begin to abandon much of these influences upon Abrahams&#x27; departure after the release of the album, starting with follow up album &quot;Stand Up&quot; (1969).

==Music==
While vocalist Ian Anderson&#x27;s creative vision largely shaped Jethro Tull&#x27;s later albums, on &quot;This Was&quot; Anderson shared songwriting duties with Tull&#x27;s guitarist Mick Abrahams. In part due to Abrahams&#x27; influence, the album incorporates more rhythm and blues and jazz influences than the progressive rock the band later became known for. In particular: &quot;This Was&quot; also contains the only Jethro Tull lead vocal not performed by Ian Anderson on a studio album, in &quot;Move on Alone&quot;. Mick Abrahams, the song&#x27;s author, provided vocals; Dee Palmer provided the horn arrangement. Abrahams left Jethro Tull following the album&#x27;s completion.

The song &quot;Dharma for One&quot;, a staple of Tull&#x27;s early concerts (usually incorporating an extended drum solo by Clive Bunker), was later covered by Ekseption, Pesky Gee! and The Ides of March. This song featured use of the &quot;claghorn&quot;, a hybrid instrument invented by Jeffrey Hammond which combined the body of a recorder, the bell of a toy trumpet and the mouthpiece of a saxophone. Anderson also claims to have invented the instrument.

In the documentary film &quot;Woodstock&quot;, the songs &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Farm&quot; and &quot;Serenade to a Cuckoo&quot; can be heard playing over the festival&#x27;s PA system.

==Reception==

&quot;This Was&quot; received generally favourable reviews and sold well upon its release. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; thoroughly recommended the album in 1968 for being &quot;full of excitement and emotion&quot; and described the band as a blues ensemble &quot;influenced by jazz music&quot; capable of setting &quot;the audience on fire&quot;. Allen Evans of &quot;New Musical Express&quot; wrote in his review that the album &quot;sounds good and has a lot of humour about it&quot; and that the band &quot;play jazz really, in a soft, appealing way, and have a bit of fun on the side with tone patterns and singing&quot;. American critic Robert Christgau, on the contrary, was appalled by the success of a band that combined &quot;the worst of Roland Kirk, Arthur Brown, and your nearest G.O. blues band.&quot;

Recent reviews of the remastered edition underline the duality of Anderson and Abrahams&#x27; songwriting and stage presence, as well as the strong ties of the band to blues in their early days. Sid Smith of BBC Music wrote that &quot;what made Tull stand out from the great-coated crowd (of touring bands) was the high-visibility of frontman Ian Anderson&#x27;s on-stage Tourette&#x27;s-inspired hyper-gurning and Mick Abraham&#x27;s ferocious fretwork.&quot; An AllMusic reviewer remarked how Jethro Tull on their vinyl debut appeared &quot;vaguely reminiscent of the Graham Bond Organization only more cohesive, and with greater commercial sense&quot;. David Davies of &quot;Record Collector&quot; reminds how &quot;&quot;This Was&quot; only hints at the depth and majesty of the ensuing seven albums&quot;, but also wrote that &quot;the direct, unfussy and predominantly blues-based&quot; tracks of the original recordings and the extra tracks of the collector&#x27;s edition &quot;could well come as something of a surprise&quot; and &quot;be of the greatest interest to Tull aficionados.&quot;

The album reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart and number 62 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 
It was voted number 574 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

<text>Ruairi Quinn (born 2 April 1946) is an Irish former Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Education and Skills from 2011 to 2014, Leader of the Labour Party from 1997 to 2002, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party from 1989 to 1997, Minister for Finance from 1994 to 1997, Minister for Enterprise and Employment from 1993 to 1994, Minister for the Public Service from 1986 to 1987, Minister for Labour from 1983 to 1986, Minister of State for Urban Affairs and Housing from 1982 to 1983. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South-East constituency from 1977 to 1981 and 1982 to 2016. He was a Senator from 1976 to 1977, after being nominated by the Taoiseach and again from 1981 to 1982 for the Industrial and Commercial Panel.

==Early life==
Quinn was born on 2 April 1946. His family were prominent republicans in County Down in the 1920s, taking an active part in the IRA during the War of Independence and on the anti-Treaty side during the Civil War. The Quinns were prosperous merchants in Newry, County Down, then moved to Dublin in the 1930s, where Quinn&#x27;s father built a successful business career.

Quinn was educated at St Michael&#x27;s College and Blackrock College, both situated in Dublin, where he was academically successful and an outstanding athlete and a member of Blackrock College&#x27;s Senior Cup rugby team. From an early age, he was interested in art and won the all-Ireland Texaco Children&#x27;s Art competition. This prompted him to study architecture at University College Dublin (UCD), in 1964 and later at the School of Ekistics in Athens.

In 1965, Quinn joined the Labour Party, working on Michael O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s successful campaign in Dublin North-Central. In the following years, Quinn was a leading student radical in UCD demanding reform of the university&#x27;s structures and the old fashioned architectural course that then prevailed. This earned him the nickname &quot;Ho Chi Quinn&quot;, after the Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh.

He travelled in Europe and became a europhile, which was to be a defining characteristic of his political career. He qualified as an architect in 1969 and married for the first time that year before embarking on studies in Athens. He and his first wife had a son and a daughter. He married again in 1990 and has a son with his second wife, Liz Allman, an architect, whose family came from Milltown, County Kerry. He then became an architect with Dublin Corporation in 1971.

==Early political career==
In 1972, Quinn decided he would stand for the Labour Party in the next general election and hoped he would be the running mate of the sitting Labour deputy for Dublin South-East, Noël Browne. The party organisation was largely moribund since the 1969 general election, as Browne had been ill and little work had been done locally. When the 1973 general election, Quinn was the only Labour Party candidate, as Browne refused to stand in principled opposition to the Labour Party&#x27;s decision to enter into a pre-election pact with Fine Gael to form a National Coalition. Quinn lost by 39 votes to Fergus O&#x27;Brien of Fine Gael in the final count. Following the 1973 election, Quinn began to rebuild the Labour Party in Dublin South-East with his mainly youthful supporters. He won a council seat on Dublin Corporation at the local elections in 1974 in the Pembroke–Rathmines local electoral area and took a leading role in the Labour Party group on the city council.

Quinn was a partner in an architecture firm from 1973 to 1982. In 1976, he was nominated by the Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, to Seanad Éireann when Brendan Halligan won a by-election in Dublin South-West and his Seanad seat became vacant. He was first elected a Labour Party TD for Dublin South-East at the 1977 general election. Quinn was at this time associated with environmental issues being the first professional architect and town planner ever elected to the Dáil. He served as environment spokesperson for the Labour Party and was very close to the party leader, Frank Cluskey, whom he had voted for in the leadership contest of 1977. Quinn lost his seat at the 1981 general election but was elected to the 15th Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial Panel. Quinn was re-elected as TD at the February 1982 general election and would continue to retain his seat at each election until his retirement in 2016.

On 10 March 1991, Quinn was observed by Gardaí driving erratically in the Clontarf area. At Clontarf Garda Station, Quinn provided a urine sample, which showed him to have an 202 mg of alcohol for 100ml of urine. He was banned from driving for a year and fined £250.

==Early ministerial career==
In 1982, he became Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. Between 1983 and 1987, he served as Minister for Labour. From 1986 to 1987, he was appointed Minister for the Public Service, held in addition to the Labour portfolio. He resigned as a minister when Labour left the government in January 1987. In 1989, he became deputy leader of the Labour Party. He was director of elections for Mary Robinson&#x27;s successful presidential election campaign in 1990.

==Minister for Enterprise and Employment==

In the Fianna Fáil–Labour Party coalition government of 1993–1994, Quinn became Minister for Enterprise and Employment.

In July 1993, Quinn adopted a successful employment policy called the Back to Work Allowance, which targeted the long-term unemployed. This allowed unemployed people to retain their unemployment benefits on a sliding scale for a number of years, while setting up a business or taking up a job. He also presided over the merger of the former Department of Industry and Commerce with the former Department of Labour, with a new focus on enterprise development and reduction of high unemployment levels. Quinn implemented reform of industrial strategy and reorganised the industrial development agencies. He also introduced the Community Employment Programme to provide activity and involvement for unemployed workers in 1994, which proved to be particularly successful.

Quinn was seen as a moderniser in economic terms, but who tried and failed to close the Irish Steel company in Haulbowline, County Cork. Nevertheless, it was in August 1994, while Quinn and Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Bertie Ahern were economic ministers, that the Irish economy was first described as the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot;.

Quinn, along with many of his Labour cabinet colleagues, strove unsuccessfully to keep the Fianna Fáil–Labour government together during the Father Brendan Smyth crisis in November 1994. He records in his autobiography that he still cannot understand why that Government fell.

==Minister for Finance==

The following year, Quinn became Minister for Finance in the Rainbow coalition of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left. He took a relatively conservative line as finance minister, conscious of his position as the first Labour Party Minister for Finance in Ireland. He quickly proved his competence, dispelling opposition jibes and stock market fears about a social democratic minister holding the sensitive finance portfolio. The Irish economy continued to perform, while inflation and the government finances were kept under firm control. Unemployment gradually fell and public debt levels improved.

During Quinn&#x27;s tenure as Minister for Finance, the overall tax burden in Ireland (the ratio of tax revenue, including pay-related social insurance levies, to gross national product) fell from 38.7% to 34.8%, of by 1.3 percentage points each year. He achieved this by limiting current government spending to grow by 6.8% in nominal terms or 4.8% in real terms, against a backdrop of improving economic fortunes, due to increasing investment in technology-intensive sectors of the Irish economy.

Under Quinn, the General Government Balance went from a deficit of 2.1% in 1995 to a surplus of 1.1% in 1997. The General Government Debt fell from 81% of GNP in 1995 to 63.6% in 1997. The year before Quinn became an economic Minister in 1993, Irish economic growth was 2.5% (1992). In 1997, it was 10.3%. The unemployment rate fell from 15.7% in 1993 to 10.3% in 1997.

Quinn served as the president of the Ecofin Council of the European Union in 1996, and worked to accelerate the launch of the European Single Currency, while securing Ireland&#x27;s qualification for the eurozone. Quinn, and his party leader and Tánaiste, Foreign Minister Dick Spring enjoyed a somewhat uneasy relationship during the Rainbow Coalition, as recounted in Quinn&#x27;s 2005 memoir. At the 1997 general election the Labour Party returned to opposition, winning only 17 of its outgoing 33 seats. Many other ministers of the Labour Party were under significant pressure from the media (particularly the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;) concerning allegations of cronyism (&quot;jobs for the boys&quot;) and abusing the privileges of office. In comparison, the opposition under Bertie Ahern placed heavy reliance on cutting tax rates as opposed to widening tax bands favoured by Quinn. Ahern also claimed that credit for the country&#x27;s improving economy was due to his earlier term in government.

==Leader of the Labour Party==

===Accession to leadership===
In October 1997, Dick Spring resigned as leader of the Labour Party following an unsuccessful campaign by the Labour Party candidate, Adi Roche, in the 1997 Irish presidential election. Quinn defeated Brendan Howlin to become the new leader. In 1999, the Labour Party and Democratic Left merged. Proinsias De Rossa of the latter party became the largely symbolic party president, while Quinn remained as leader of the party. He used his years of leadership to develop a strong policy platform, publishing a Spatial Strategy for future development of the country, promoting universal access to health insurance, advocating reform of the Garda Síochána, and arguing for closer European integration. Fianna Fáil countered by exploiting Quinn&#x27;s middle-class background, labelling him &quot;Mr Angry from Sandymount,&quot; the middle-class district of Dublin where Quinn is a longtime resident, and part of the constituency he represented.

===2002 general election===

At the 2002 general election, which saw the incumbent Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats government re-elected, the Labour Party returned with no net gain since the previous election, after accounting for the merger with Democratic Left. Quinn fought that election on an independent platform, although he indicated a preference to enter government with Fine Gael, with which he had served with in the Rainbow coalition era. Quinn&#x27;s strategy was predicated on the Labour Party holding the balance of power and keeping a distance from the two bigger parties. This underestimated the attraction for the electorate of the outgoing Ahern Government, which had enjoyed extraordinary economic growth and prosperity.

Realising that the choice was between a majority Fianna Fáil government on the one hand, or a government of Fianna Fáil in coalition with the Progressive Democrats, Michael McDowell, a constituency rival of Quinn&#x27;s, seized the moment and put themselves forward as the guarantor of the public interest in a new Fianna Fáil government. Under the leadership of Michael Noonan, Fine Gael lost 23 seats, being reduced to 31 seats, their worst performance in decades.

Quinn was disappointed that, even though Labour had not lost seats in net numbers and Fine Gael had lost 23 seats, he had failed to increase the number of seats his party held, in an election that resulted in gains for small parties on the left end of the political spectrum, such as Sinn Féin and the Green Party. Quinn himself was re-elected on the last count by 600 votes. Accepting that he would now be in opposition for another term, Quinn announced that he would not seek re-election for another six-year term as leader of the Labour Party, at the end of August 2002.

==Post-leadership==

In October 2002, Quinn&#x27;s term as party leader expired and he retired as Labour leader, being replaced in a leadership election by Pat Rabbitte. When Rabbitte resigned as party leader in 2007, Quinn supported the successful candidacy of Eamon Gilmore. His public support of Gilmore, where he also brought the endorsement of all the Dublin City Councillors in his area, was seen as instrumental in discouraging other candidates from entering the race. Quinn caused anger and controversy when he refused to give up his minister&#x27;s pension worth €41,656 while sitting as a TD in 2009. He eventually backed down after pressure was put on him to give up the pension.

Quinn led the European Movement Ireland, a pro-EU lobby group in Ireland until late 2007, when he re-founded the Irish Alliance for Europe to campaign on the Treaty of Lisbon. Quinn is also vice-president and Treasurer of the Party of European Socialists. He is a brother of Lochlann Quinn, former chairman of Allied Irish Banks, and a first cousin of Senator Feargal Quinn. His nephew, Oisín Quinn, was a Labour Party Dublin City Councillor between 2004 and 2014.

In 2005, his political memoir, &quot;Straight Left&quot;, was published.

==2007 general election==

At the 2007 general election, Quinn increased his share of the poll by some 4% and was returned to the 30th Dáil. He was nominated for the post of Ceann Comhairle but was defeated by John O&#x27;Donoghue. Quinn became Labour Party spokesperson on Education and Science as a member of Eamon Gilmore&#x27;s front bench in September 2007. Quinn contributed to the successful second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty in September 2009 and continued to be an office holder with the Party of European Socialists.

==2011 general election==
In September 2010, Quinn was appointed as the Labour Party&#x27;s national director of elections for the 2011 general election by Gilmore. He had been selected along with Kevin Humphreys to be a candidate for Labour in that election. Both Quinn and Humphreys were elected to the 31st Dáil on 27 February 2011; strategic vote management saw the Labour Party in Dublin South-East secure two seats with only a quarter of the first preference vote.

==Minister for Education: 2011–2014==
On 9 March 2011, Quinn was appointed as Minister for Education and Skills in the Fine Gael–Labour coalition government. In May 2011, he confirmed a U-turn on a pre-election pledge that he would reverse a proposed increase in third-level student registration fees, instead providing for a €500 increase in the fee payable by students. In July 2011, Quinn had again refused to rule out the return of college fees as he acknowledged the funding crisis in the higher education sector. The Minister told a meeting of the Higher Education Authority (HEA) that the funding crisis in higher education will “not go away” for many years to come. Asked if new charges were planned, he said: “I honestly can&#x27;t say. We are looking for efficiencies in the system at third level. ... I have said to Brendan Howlin that I will deliver.”

In October 2012, Quinn announced the phasing out of the current Junior Certificate programme over the next eight years, to be replaced by a school-based model of continuous assessment. He described his plan as &quot;the most radical shake-up of the junior cycle programme since the ending of the Inter Cert in 1991&quot;, and claimed the scrapping of the Junior Certificate exams would help the &quot;bottom half&quot; of students. This reform was never implemented.

On 12 October 2012, Quinn, speaking to an audience at an anniversary celebration for St Kilian&#x27;s German School, said the &quot;demons of nationalism&quot; and &quot;chauvinism&quot; embedded in our cultures would only stay under control if there was a deeper European culture. He went on to say they &quot;will only stay in the place where they belong if we have more Europe, if we have a deeper Europe, if we have a wider Europe&quot;.

On 29 January 2013, Quinn launched Ireland&#x27;s first national plan to tackle bullying in schools, including cyberbullying. The Action Plan on Bullying set out 12 clear actions on how to prevent and tackle bullying.

Quinn was responsible for the Further Education and Training Act 2013, which replaced the largely discredited state training and employment agency, FÁS, with a new statutory body named SOLAS.

On 2 July 2014, Ruairi Quinn announced his decision to resign as Minister for Education and Skills, which became effective following the cabinet reshuffle on 11 July. He also said that he would not be seeking re-election to the Dáil after the 2016 Irish general election.

==Post-political activities==
Since 2016, Quinn has sat on various boards, including as chairperson of the Irish Architectural Archive (2020–2023), and as a director of the Institute of International and European Affairs.

<text>Sir Henry Hamilton Johnston (12 June 1858 – 31 July 1927) was a British explorer, botanist, artist, colonial administrator, and linguist who travelled widely across Africa to speak some of the languages spoken by people on that continent. He published 40 books on subjects related to the continent of Africa and was one of the key players in the Scramble for Africa that occurred at the end of the 19th century.

==Early years==
Johnston was born at Kennington Park, south London, the son of John Brookes Johnstone and Esther Laetitia Hamilton. He attended Stockwell grammar school and then King&#x27;s College London, followed by four years studying painting at the Royal Academy. In connection with his studies, he travelled to Europe and North Africa, visiting the little-known (by Europeans) interior of Tunisia.

==Exploration in Africa==
In 1882, he visited southern Angola with the Earl of Mayo, and in the following year met Henry Morton Stanley in the Congo, becoming one of the first Europeans after Stanley to see the river above the Stanley Pool.

His developing reputation led the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association to appoint him leader of a scientific expedition to Mount Kilimanjaro in 1884. On the expedition, Johnston concluded treaties with local chiefs (which were then transferred to the British East Africa Company), in competition with German efforts to do likewise.

==British colonial service and the Cape to Cairo vision==
In October 1886, the British government appointed him vice-consul in Cameroon and the Niger River delta area, where a protectorate had been declared in 1885, and he became acting consul in 1887, deposing and banishing the local chief Jaja. 

While in West Africa in 1886, Johnston sketched what has been termed a &quot;fantasy map&quot; of his ideas of how the African continent could be divided among the colonial powers. This envisaged two blocks of British colonies, one of continuous territory in West Africa, the Nile valley and much of East Africa as far south as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyasa, the other in southern Africa south of the Zambezi. This left a continuous band in Portuguese occupation from Angola to Mozambique and Germany in possession of much of the East African coast.

The original proposal for a Cape to Cairo railway was made in 1874 by Edwin Arnold, the then editor of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, which was joint sponsor of the expedition by H. M. Stanley to Africa to discover the course of the Congo River. The proposed route involved a mixture of railway and river transport between Elizabethville, now Lubumbashi in the Belgian Congo and Sennar in the Sudan rather than a completely rail one. Johnston later acknowledged his debt to Stanley and Arnold and when on leave in England in 1888, he revived the Cape-to-Cairo concept of acquiring a continuous band of British territory down Africa in discussion with Lord Salisbury. Johnston then published an supporting the idea article in &quot;Times&quot; anonymously, as &quot;by an African Explorer&quot; and later in 1888 and 1889 published a number of articles in other newspapers and journals with Salisbury&#x27;s tacit approval.

==Scramble for Katanga==
The Berlin Conference had allocated Katanga to the sphere of influence of King Leopold of Belgium&#x27;s Congo Free State, but under the Berlin Conference&#x27;s Principle of Effectivity this was only provisional. In July 1890, Leopold protested to Lord Salisbury that Johnston, as agent for Cecil Rhodes, was circulating maps showing that the Congo Free State did not include Katanga, and in response to Salisbury&#x27;s enquiries, in August 1890 Johnston presented Rhodes&#x27; claim, which included the false information that Msiri, King of Garanganze in Katanga had asked for British protection. 

In November 1890, to justify his claim, Johnston sent Alfred Sharpe (who would become his successor in Nyasaland) to act for Rhodes and the British South Africa Company (BSAC), to obtain a treaty with Msiri, a move which had the potential to precipitate an Anglo-Belgian crisis. Sharpe failed with Msiri, though he obtained treaties with Mwata Kazembe covering the eastern side of the Luapula River and Lake Mweru, and with other chiefs covering the southern end of Lake Tanganyika. When Leopold again protested to Salisbury in May 1891, the latter had to admit Msiri had not signed a treaty asking for British protection and left Katanga open to Belgian colonisation. In 1891 Leopold sent the Stairs Expedition to Katanga. Johnston dissuaded it from accessing Katanga through Nyasaland, but it went through German East Africa instead, and took Katanga after killing Msiri. The southern border of the Congo Free State was settled by an Anglo-Congo agreement of 1894.

==Nyasaland (British Central Africa Protectorate)==

In 1879, the Portuguese government formally claimed the area south and east of the Ruo River (currently the southeastern border of Malawi) and then, in 1882, occupied the lower Shire River valley as far north as the Ruo. It attempted to gain British acceptance of this claim without success, and also failed in a claim that the Shire Highlands was part of Portuguese East Africa, as it was not under effective occupation As late as 1888, the British Foreign Office would not accept responsibility for British missionaries and settlers in the Shire Highlands after the African Lakes Corporation had tried but failed to become a Chartered company with interests there and around the western shore of Lake Malawi.

However, in 1885–86, Alexandre de Serpa Pinto had undertaken an expedition which reached Shire Highlands, which had failed to make any treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs west of Lake Malawi. To prevent possible Portuguese occupation, in November 1888, Johnston was appointed as Commissioner and Consul-general for the Mozambique and the Nyasa districts, and arrived in Blantyre in March 1889. On his way to take up his appointment, Johnston spent six weeks in Lisbon attempting to negotiate an acceptable agreement on Portuguese and British spheres of influence in southeastern Africa. However, as the draft agreement did not expressly exclude the Shire Highlands from the Portuguese sphere, it was rejected by the Foreign Office.

Among several pressing problems was the Karonga War, a dispute between Swahili traders in slaves and ivory with their Henga allies on one side and the African Lakes Trading Company and factions of the Ngonde people on the other which had broken out in 1887. As Johnston had no significant forces at that time, he agreed to a truce with the Swahili leaders in October 1889, but the Swahili traders did not adhere to its terms.

In late 1888 and early 1889, the Portuguese government sent two expeditions to make treaties of protection with local chiefs, one under Antonio Cardoso set off toward Lake Malawi, the other under Alexandre de Serpa Pinto moved up the Shire valley. Between them, they made more than twenty treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi. Johnston met Serpa Pinto in August 1889, east of the Ruo, and advised him not to cross the river, but Serpa Pinto disregarded this and crossed the river to Chiromo, now in Malawi. In September, following minor clashes between Serpa Pinto&#x27;s force and local Africans, Johnston&#x27;s deputy declared a Shire Highlands Protectorate, despite the contrary instructions. Johnston&#x27;s proclamation of a further protectorate west of Lake Malawi, the Nyasaland Districts Protectorate, was endorsed by the Foreign Office in May 1891.

Johnston arrived in Chiromo, in the south of Nyasaland, on 16 July 1891. By that time, he had already selected a team of men who were to assist in forming the administration of the new protectorate. They included Alfred Sharpe (Johnston&#x27;s Deputy Commissioner), Bertram L. Sclater (surveyor, roadmaker, and Commandant of the Constabulary), Alexander Whyte (a zoologist who was to discover several new species in Nyasaland), Cecil Montgomery Maguire (military commandant), Hugh Charlie Marshall (Customs Officer, Collector of Revenues and Postmaster for the Chiromo district), John Buchanan (an agriculturalist who had been in Nyasaland since 1876, and was appointed Vice Consul by Johnston), and others.

In 1891, Johnston only controlled a fraction of the Shire Highlands, itself a small part of the whole protectorate. He was provided with a small force of Indian troops in 1891, and began to train African soldiers and police. At first, Johnston used his small force in the south of the protectorate to suppress slave trading by Yao chiefs, who had established links with Swahili traders in ivory and slaves from the early 19th century. As the Yao people had no central authority, Johnston was able to defeat one group at a time, although this took until 1894, as he left the most powerful chief, Makanjira, until almost last, starting an amphibious operation against him in late 1893.

Before the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in May 1891, a number of European companies and settlers had made, or claimed to have made, treaties with local chiefs under which the land owned by the African communities that occupied it was transferred to the Europeans in exchange for protection and some trade goods. The African Lakes Company claimed more than 2.75 million acres in the north of the protectorate, some under treaties that claimed to transfer sovereignty to the company, and three others individuals claimed to have purchased large areas of land in the south. Eugene Sharrer claimed 363,034 acres, Alexander Low Bruce claimed 176,000 acres, and John Buchanan and his brothers claimed a further 167,823 acres. These lands were purchased for trivial quantities of goods under agreements signed by chiefs with no understanding of English concepts of land tenure.

Johnston had the task of reviewing these land claims, and he began to do so in late 1892, as the proclamation of the protectorate had been followed by a wholesale land grab, with huge areas of land bought for trivial sums and some claims overlapping. He rejected any suggestion that treaties made before the protectorate was established could transfer sovereignty to individuals or companies, but accept that they could be evidence of land sales. Although Johnston accepted that the land belonged to its African communities, so their chiefs had no right to alienate it, he suggested that each community had given their chief this right. Despite having no legal training, he claimed that, as Commissioner, he was entitled to investigate these land sales and to issue Certificates of Claim registering freehold title to the European claimants. He rejected very few claims, despite the questionable evidence for several major ones. The existing African villages and farms were exempted from these sales, and the villagers were told that their homes and fields were not being alienated. Despite this, the concentration of much of the most fertile land in the Shire Highlands in the hands of European owners had profound economic consequences that lasted throughout the colonial period.

In April 1894, Johnston returned to England and was away for a year. He had quarrelled with Cecil Rhodes, who had so far provided most of his funds, and during the first three years the administration had run up a deficit of £20,000. During his leave, Johnston managed to persuade the British Government to agree to take over the financing of the country. On his way back, he visited Egypt and India with a view to recruiting soldiers, and eventually arrived back in Nyasaland with a flotilla of boats, 202 Sikh soldiers, and more than 400 other men; 4,000 porters were recruited in the Shire Highlands to carry stores and equipment. Johnston reached Zomba on 3 May 1895.

Johnston visited Karonga in June 1895 to try to make a settlement, but the Swahili leaders refused either to meet him or to curtail their raiding activities, so Johnston decided on military action. In November 1895, Johnston embarked with a force of more than 400 Sikh and African riflemen, with artillery and machine guns on steamers, to Karonga and surrounded the traders&#x27; main stockaded town, bombarding it for two days and finally assaulting it on 4 December. The Swahili leader, Mlozi, was captured, given a cursory trial and hanged on 5 December, and between 200 and 300 of fighters and several hundred non-combatants were killed, many while attempting to surrender. Other Swahili stockades did not resist and were destroyed.

==North-Eastern Rhodesia and Nyasaland==
Johnston realised the strategic importance of Lake Tanganyika to the British, especially since the territory between the lake and the coast had become German East Africa, forming a break of nearly in the chain of British colonies in the Cape to Cairo dream. However, the north end of Lake Tanganyika was only from British-controlled Uganda, and so a British presence at the south end of the lake was a priority. Although the northern boundaries of North-Eastern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were eventually settled by negotiations between Britain, Germany. Portugal and the Congo Free State, Johnston ensured that British bomas were established (in addition to those in Nyasaland) east of Luapula-Mweru at Chiengi and the Kalungwishi River, at the south end of Lake Tanganyika at Abercorn, and at Fort Jameson between Mozambique and the Luangwa valley to demonstrate effective occupation. 

Until 1899, Johnston had administrative control of the territory which became North-Eastern Rhodesia (the north-eastern half of today&#x27;s Zambia), and he helped to set up and oversee the British South Africa Company&#x27;s administration in that area. North-Eastern Rhodesia was little developed in this period, being regarded principally as a labour reserve, with only a handful of company administrators.

Despite having missed out in Katanga, altogether he helped to consolidate an area of nearly half a million square kilometres into the British Empire – nearly , or twice the area of the United Kingdom in 2009 – lying between the lower Luangwa River valley and lakes Nyasa, Tanganyika, and Mweru.

==Later years==
In 1896, in recognition of this achievement, Johnston was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), but afflicted by tropical fevers, he transferred to Tunis as consul-general. In the same year, he had married the Hon. Winifred Mary Irby, daughter of Florance George Henry Irby, fifth Baron Boston.

In 1899, Sir Harry was sent to Uganda as special commissioner to reorganize the administration of that protectorate after the suppression of the mutiny of the Sudanese soldiers and to end an ongoing war with Unyoro. He improved the colonial administration, and concluded the Buganda Agreement of 1900, dividing the land between the UK and the chiefs. For his services in Uganda, he received the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours list in November 1901. Also in 1901, Johnston was the first recipient of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society&#x27;s Livingstone Medal, and in the following year he was appointed a member of the council of the Zoological Society of London. He received the honorary degree &quot;Doctor of Science&quot; (D.Sc.) from the University of Cambridge in May 1902. The Royal Geographical Society awarded him their 1904 Founder&#x27;s Medal for his services to African exploration.

In 1902, his wife gave birth to twin boys, but neither survived more than a few hours, and the couple had no more children. Johnston&#x27;s sister, Mabel Johnston, married Arnold Dolmetsch, an instrument maker and member of the Bloomsbury set, in 1903.

In 1903 and in 1906, Johnston stood for parliament for the Liberal Party, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. In 1906, the Johnstons moved to the hamlet of Poling, near Arundel in West Sussex, where Johnston largely concentrated on his literary endeavours. He took to writing novels, which were frequently short-lived, while his accounts of his own voyages through central Africa were rather more enduring.



Johnston suffered two strokes in 1925, from which he became partially paralysed and never recovered, dying two years later in 1927 at Woodsetts House near Worksop in Nottinghamshire. He was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Poling, West Sussex, where there is a commemorative wall plaque within the nave of the church designed and cut by the Arts and Crafts sculptor and typeface designer Eric Gill who lived in nearby Ditchling.

==Legacy==
Harry Johnston is commemorated in the scientific names of the okapi, &quot;Okapia johnstoni&quot;, and of two species of African lizards, &quot;Trioceros johnstoni&quot; and &quot;Latastia johnstonii&quot;.

The falls at Mambidima on the Luapula River were named &quot;Johnston Falls&quot; by the British in his honour.

Sir Harry Johnston Primary school in Zomba, Malawi is also named after him.

Prominent Bengali author Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay mentioned the influence of Sir H. H. Johnston&#x27;s works, one of many, in helping him portray scenes convincingly in his famous Bengali adventure novel Chander Pahar.

<text>Frank Cluskey (8 April 1930 – 7 May 1989) was an Irish Labour Party politician who served as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism from 1982 to 1983, Leader of the Labour Party from 1977 to 1981 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare from 1973 to 1977. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South-Central and Dublin Central constituencies from 1965 to 1981 and 1982 to 1989.

==Early and personal life==
Cluskey was born on 8 April 1930 in Dublin, the youngest of two sons and three daughters of Francis Cluskey a butcher and active trade unionist, and Elizabeth Cluskey (née Millington). His father was long-serving secretary of the butchers&#x27; section of the Workers&#x27; Union of Ireland (WUI)), and a close associate of James Larkin. He was educated at St. Vincent&#x27;s C.B.S. in Glasnevin. He worked as a butcher and then joined the Labour Party. He quickly became a branch secretary in the WUI. He married Eileen Gillespie in 1965, a post office civil servant from Clontarf; she died after a short illness in 1978. They had two daughters and one son.

==Politics==
At the 1965 general election he was elected as a Labour Party Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin South-Central constituency. He was a member of Dublin City Council from 1960 to 1969, and in 1968 he was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin. In 1973 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Brendan Corish. He introduced sweeping reforms to the area while he held that position, pushing through legislation introducing a &#x27;single-mothers&#x27; welfare allowance and managing with his colleagues to triple welfare spending between 1973 and 1977. He played a leading role in initiating the EU Poverty Programmes.

The Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition was defeated at the 1977 general election resulting in the resignation of Brendan Corish as Labour Party leader. Cluskey was elected the new leader of the Labour Party. In 1981, the Labour Party entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael. However Cluskey had lost his seat at the 1981 general election and resigned the party leadership. On 1 July 1981, he was appointed as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Dublin, replacing Michael O&#x27;Leary, who had resigned the seat after succeeding Cluskey as Labour leader.

The coalition government fell in January 1982 over a budget dispute, and Cluskey was re-elected to the Dáil at the February 1982 general election. When the coalition returned to office after the November 1982 election, Cluskey was appointed as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism. He then resigned from the European Parliament, to be replaced by Brendan Halligan.

On 8 December 1983 he resigned as Minister due to a fundamental disagreement over government policy about the Dublin Gas Company. He retained his Dáil seat in the 1987 general election.

Following his re-election his health deteriorated. He died on 7 May 1989 after a long battle with cancer.

<text>Eoin O&#x27;Duffy (born Owen Duffy; 28 January 1890 – 30 November 1944) was an Irish revolutionary, soldier, police commissioner and politician. O&#x27;Duffy was the leader of the Monaghan Brigade of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and a prominent figure in the Ulster IRA during the Irish War of Independence. In this capacity, he became Chief of Staff of the IRA in 1922. He accepted the Anglo-Irish Treaty and as a general became Chief of Staff of the National Army in the Irish Civil War, on the pro-Treaty side.

He had been an early member of Sinn Féin and was elected a Teachta Dála (TD) for Monaghan in the Second Dáil in 1921, supporting pro-Treaty Sinn Féin in the split of 1922. In 1923 he became associated with Cumann na nGaedheal.

He was appointed as the second Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in 1922, the police force of the new Irish Free State, serving until 1933. In 1924, during the Irish Army Mutiny, he was appointed as General Officer Commanding of the Irish Army, holding both roles until 1925.

In the 1930s O&#x27;Duffy became attracted to the various fascist movements on the continent. In 1933 O&#x27;Duffy took control of the paramilitary movement called Army Comrades Association, also known as the Blueshirts. When the Blueshirts merged with Cumann na nGaedhael and National Centre Party to form Fine Gael, O&#x27;Duffy began the new party&#x27;s first leader, remaining as such for 13 months. He subsequently raised the Irish Brigade to fight for the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War as an act of Catholic solidarity and was inspired by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy to create the National Corporate Party. During the Second World War, he was clandestinely involved in pro-Axis circles but focused mostly on athletic administration in his capacity as president of the National Athletics and Cycling Association. He died in 1944.

O&#x27;Duffy was active in multiple sporting bodies, including the Gaelic Athletic Association and the Irish Olympic Council.

==Early life==
Eoin O&#x27;Duffy was born Owen Duffy in Lough Egish, near Castleblayney, County Monaghan, on 28 January 1890 to an impoverished smallholder family. He was the youngest of seven children. His father, also named Owen Duffy, had inherited his farm from his father Peter in 1888; however, the family were forced to farm conacre land and work on the roads to make ends meet. O&#x27;Duffy attended Laggan national school. He graduated to a school in Laragh where he developed an interest in the Gaelic Revival and attended night classes hosted by the Gaelic League. He was close to his mother, Bridget Fealy, who died of cancer when he was 12. O&#x27;Duffy was devastated by her death and he wore her ring for the rest of his life.

In 1909, he sat the king&#x27;s scholarship examination for St Patrick&#x27;s College, Dublin, but as a place was not assured, he applied to become a clerk in the county surveyor&#x27;s office in Monaghan. O&#x27;Duffy decided to pursue a career as a surveyor and came fifth in the local government board examination in 1912. O&#x27;Duffy was appointed and moved to Newbliss to take up his new position. He later secured a post as an engineer.

==Involvement in sport==
===Ulster GAA===

O&#x27;Duffy was a leading member of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Ulster. He was appointed secretary of the Ulster Provincial Council in 1912. He later served as Treasurer of the GAA Ulster Council from 1921 to 1934. His important role in developing the GAA in Ulster is memorialised by the O&#x27;Duffy Terrace at the principal provincial stadium, St Tiernach&#x27;s Park in Clones, County Monaghan. In December 2009 a plaque was erected in memory of O&#x27;Duffy in Aughnamullen. The plaque was unveiled by the President of the Ulster GAA Council, Tom Daly.

He was also a member of Harps&#x27; Gaelic football club.

===Other sports===
As well as being a prominent figure in Ulster GAA he was also active in other sports. He was President of the Irish Amateur Handball Association from 1926 to 1934, the National Athletic and Cycling Association from 1931 to 1934 (which he founded in 1922), and the Irish Olympic Council from 1931 to 1932.

O&#x27;Duffy believed in the ideal of &quot;cleaned manliness&quot;. He said sport &quot;cultivates in a boy habits of self-control [and] self-denial&quot; and promotes &quot;the cleanest and most wholesome of the instincts of youth&quot;. He said a lack of sport caused some boys to have &quot;failed to keep their athleticism, but became weedy youths, smoking too soon, drinking too soon&quot;.

==Political activities==
===Irish Republican Army and Sinn Féin===

In 1917, O&#x27;Duffy joined the Irish Volunteers and took an active part in the Irish War of Independence, after that organisation became the Irish Republican Army (IRA). He rose rapidly through the ranks. He started as the Section Commander of the Clones Company, then Captain, then Commandant and finally appointed Brigadier in 1919. He came to the attention of Michael Collins, who enrolled him in the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and supported his advancement in the movement&#x27;s hierarchy. One year later, Collins described O&#x27;Duffy as &quot;the best man in Ulster&quot;. O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s senior involvement in the GAA and knowledge of Monaghan from his job as a surveyor proved invaluable for organisation and recruitment.

In 1918 O&#x27;Duffy became secretary of Sinn Féin&#x27;s north Monaghan area council. On 14 September 1918 he and Daniel Hogan were arrested after a GAA match and charged with &quot;illegal assembly&quot;. He was imprisoned in Belfast Prison and released on 19 November 1918. After his release O&#x27;Duffy focused on organising his brigade and built an effective intelligence network by cultivating contacts with susceptible RIC men. He was forced to go on the run after a RIC raid on his house in September 1919 but continued to draw his salary from the Monaghan County Council.

On 15 February 1920, he (along with Ernie O&#x27;Malley) was involved in the first capture of a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks by the IRA in Ballytrain, in his native Monaghan. The raid boosted local IRA recruitment, shook RIC morale and resulted in the closure of many barracks in rural Monaghan. O&#x27;Duffy was once again arrested and imprisoned in Belfast Prison, where he went on hunger strike. He was released in June and arranged which Sinn Féin candidates would stand in Monaghan during the 1920 Irish local elections.

O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s brigade started raiding the homes of Protestants for arms, increasing sectarian tensions. The raids were not necessarily targeting protestants but unionists as Fearghall McGarry writes &quot;the raids were also motivated by sectarian tensions and the Volunteers’ resentment of Protestant support for the authorities: ‘They gave information concerning the IRA to Crown forces and maintained a most hostile attitude to everything republican.’&quot; The raids were immensely unpopular even amongst the volunteers and &quot;Local Protestants, many of them isolated in rural nationalist areas, were outraged...In contrast, one Protestant, whose ‘dog was very friendly with the raiders’ received a polite apology for the disturbance, while another paid ‘tribute to the pleasant way that the raiders visited him. They came and parted on the happiest terms.’&quot; Armed Orangemen began parading the roads of Unionist areas and tit-for-tat killings occurred in reprisal for IRA casualties incurred during raids. He supported the Belfast Boycott and his brigade began harassing of Protestant stores, burning delivery vans from Belfast, raiding trains carrying northern goods and sabotaging rail tracks.

O&#x27;Duffy became more ruthless in 1921, intensifying attacks on British forces and executions of suspected informers and other opponents of the IRA. When a Protestant trader named George Lester held up and searched two boys he suspected of being dispatch carriers for the IRA in February 1921, O&#x27;Duffy ordered his death. Lester was shot but survived his injury. In retaliation, the B Specials invaded Rosslea on 23 February and sacked the Catholic part of the town. One month later the IRA, commanded by O&#x27;Duffy, raided the town in reprisal, burning fourteen houses and killing three Protestants, two of them B Specials.

He became director of the army in 1921. In May 1921 he was returned as a Sinn Féin TD for the Monaghan constituency to the Second Dáil. He was re-elected at the 1922 general election.

In March 1921, he was made commander of the IRA&#x27;s 2nd Northern Division. Following the Truce with the British in July 1921, he was sent to Belfast. After the rioting known as Belfast&#x27;s Bloody Sunday, he was given the task of liaising with the British to try to maintain the Truce and defend Catholic areas against attack. During this time he gained the nickname &quot;Give &#x27;em the lead&quot; after delivering a belligerent speech in South Armagh threatening that if unionists &quot;decided they were against Ireland and against their fellow countrymen&quot; the IRA would &quot;have to use the lead against them&quot;. He was Director of Organisation in Ulster and Chief Liaison officer for Ulster at the time the treaty was signed.

In January 1922 he became IRA Chief of Staff, replacing Richard Mulcahy. O&#x27;Duffy was the youngest general in Europe until Spanish general Francisco Franco was promoted to that rank.

===Civil War General and Garda Síochána===
In 1921 he supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, being pessimistic about the IRA&#x27;s chances should the war resume and seeing the treaty as a stepping stone to a republic. Frank Aiken, a future military and political opponent, stated that from the signing of the treaty to the attack on the Four Courts in June 1922, O&#x27;Duffy did Herculean work for the pro-treaty cause. Further, Aiken felt that without those endeavours, aided by Mulcahy and Eoin MacNeill, the Civil War would not have taken place.

On 14 January, Dan Hogan was arrested in Derry by the B Specials. In response, O&#x27;Duffy proposed the kidnapping of a hundred prominent Orangemen in Fermanagh and Tyrone to Collins. The raid was executed on 7 February. On 22 April, O&#x27;Duffy accused Liam Lynch&#x27;s 1st Southern Division of retaining arms intended for the Northern IRA. Lynch in turn blamed O&#x27;Duffy for the arms not reaching the north.

He served as a general in the National Army and was given control of the South-Western Command. In the ensuing Irish Civil War he was one of the architects behind the Free State&#x27;s strategy of seaborne landings in Republican-held areas. He took Limerick for the Free State in July 1922, before being held up in the Battle of Killmallock south of the city. The enmities of the Civil War era were to stay with O&#x27;Duffy throughout his political career.

In September 1922, Minister for Home Affairs Kevin O&#x27;Higgins was experiencing indiscipline within the recently formed Garda Síochána and O&#x27;Duffy was appointed Garda Commissioner after resigning from the army to take up the position. O&#x27;Duffy was a fine organiser and has been given much of the credit for the emergence of a largely respected, non-political and unarmed police force. He insisted on a Catholic ethos to distinguish the Gardaí from their Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) predecessors, and regularly told members of the force they were not just men working an ordinary job, but policemen fulfilling their religious duty. He was also a vocal opponent of alcohol in the force, instructing Gardaí to avoid it in his first public address as Garda Commissioner. He encouraged Garda members to join the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association of the Sacred Heart. Although Garda were not allowed to wear pins on their uniform, O&#x27;Duffy made an exception for the Pioneer pin. In 1924 during the Irish Army Mutiny he was appointed as General Officer Commanding of the Irish Army, holding both roles until 1925.

In February, following a general election in 1933, Executive Council President Éamon de Valera dismissed O&#x27;Duffy as Garda Commissioner. In the Dáil de Valera explained the reason for his dismissal, stating &quot;[O&#x27;Duffy] was likely to be biased in his attitude because of past political affiliations&quot;. The true reason, however, appears to have been the new government&#x27;s discovery that shortly after the 1932 election, O&#x27;Duffy was one of the voices urging the Cumann na nGaedheal government of W. T. Cosgrave to resort to a military coup rather than to turn over power to the incoming Fianna Fáil administration. O&#x27;Duffy refused the offer of another position of equivalent rank in the public service. Ernest Blythe said many years later that Cosgrave had become so alarmed by O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s conduct that had he returned to power he would have also sacked O&#x27;Duffy as De Valera had done. However O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s dismissal was criticised in the Dáil at the time by Cumann na nGaedheal politicians.

===Leader of the Blueshirts===

In July 1933 O&#x27;Duffy, urged by Blythe and Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins, became leader of the Army Comrades Association, an organisation set up to protect Cumann na nGaedheal public meetings, which had been disrupted under the slogan &quot;No Free Speech for Traitors&quot; by Irish Republican Army members newly confident after the elections. O&#x27;Duffy and many other conservative elements within the Irish Free State began to embrace fascist ideology, which was in vogue at that time and O&#x27;Duffy was seen to be an ideal choice to lead the Blueshirts as he was considered charismatic, skilled in organising and also untainted by association with the failures of the previous Cumann na nGaedheal government.

O&#x27;Duffy was approved as leader of the ACA on 20 July. He soon changed the name of this new movement to the National Guard. An admirer of the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, O&#x27;Duffy and his organisation adopted outward symbols of European fascism such as the straight-arm Roman salute and a distinctive blue uniform. It was not long before they became known as the Blueshirts, similar to the Italian Blackshirts and the German Brownshirts. O&#x27;Duffy established a weekly newspaper, the Blueshirt, and published a new constitution that promoted corporatism, Irish unification and opposition to &quot;alien&quot; control and influence.

In July 1933, O&#x27;Duffy announced plans for a parade by the Blueshirts in Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Arthur Griffith, and Kevin O&#x27;Higgins. An annual march to Leinster Lawn to commemorate the three pro-Treaty nationalists had been held until Fianna Fáil came to power in 1932. De Valera feared a similar &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; as seen in Italy and the Special Branch raided the houses of prominent people aligned with Cumann na nGaedheal to seize their firearms. On 11 August, de Valera reinstated the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Act 1931, banned the parade and placed Gardaí outside of key locations. 48 hours before the planned march, 200 men were recruited into an auxiliary special branch of the police soon nicknamed the Broy Harriers.

On 22 August the Blueshirts were declared an illegal organisation. To circumvent this ban the movement once again adopted a new name, this time styling itself the League of Youth. In 1933 a group of Irish republicans, one member of which was Dan Keating, planned to assassinate O&#x27;Duffy in Ballyseedy, County Kerry, while he would be on his way to a meeting. A man was sent to Limerick to find out which car O&#x27;Duffy would be travelling in but the man purposely gave false information and O&#x27;Duffy escaped.

During the early stages of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, O&#x27;Duffy offered Benito Mussolini the service of 1000 Blueshirts because he believed the war represented the struggle between civilisation and barbarism. On 18 September, in an interview he said that the Blueshirts were volunteering to fight &quot;not for Italy or against Abyssinia, but for the principle of the corporate system&quot; against which &quot;the forces of both Marxism and of capitalism&quot; were ranged.

O&#x27;Duffy and some of his men also made an appearance at the 1934 International Fascist conference in Montreux where he argued against antisemitism, telling the conference that they had &quot;no Jewish problem in Ireland&quot; and that he &quot;could not subscribe to the principle of the persecution of any race&quot;. Upon his return to Ireland, he indicated his preference for Italian fascism over German Nazism, stating: &quot;the Nazi policy is not compatible with the corporative system.&quot;

===Fine Gael===

On 24 August 1933, representatives of Cumann na nGaedheal and the National Centre Party approached O&#x27;Duffy, offering that the Blueshirts join their ranks in exchange for O&#x27;Duffy becoming their leader. On 8 September the Blueshirts, under pressure after de Valera&#x27;s ban on the organisation, approved the merger and so Cumann na nGaedheal, the Centre Party and the Blueshirt movement merged to form Fine Gael. O&#x27;Duffy, though not a TD, became the first leader, with W. T. Cosgrave serving as Vice President and parliamentary leader. The National Guard, now rechristened the Young Ireland Association, was transformed from an illegal paramilitary group into the militant wing of a political party.

The new party&#x27;s policy document, published in mid-November 1933, sought the reunification of Ireland within the British Commonwealth but made no mention of a corporatist parliament and committed itself to democracy. As a result, O&#x27;Duffy was forced to tone down his anti-democratic rhetoric though many of his Blueshirt colleagues continued to advocate authoritarianism.

Fine Gael meetings were often attacked by IRA members and O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s touring of rural towns resulted in tensions and violence. On 6 October 1933 O&#x27;Duffy was involved in disturbances in Tralee during which he was hit with a hammer on the head and had his car torched as he attempted to attend a Fine Gael convention. De Valera used the violence to justify a crackdown on Blueshirt activities. A raid on the Young Ireland Association found evidence that it was the National Guard under another name, and the organisation was once again banned. O&#x27;Duffy responded with a speech in Ballyshannon where referred to himself as a republican and declared that &quot;whenever Mr de Valera runs away from the Republic and arrests you Republicans, and puts you on board beds in Mountjoy, he is entitled to the fate he gave Mick Collins and Kevin O’Higgins&quot;. O&#x27;Duffy was arrested by the Gardaí several days later. He was initially released on appeal but was summoned to appear before the Military Tribunal two days later and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and incitement to murder the president of the executive council, however, they were unable to convict him of either charge.

O&#x27;Duffy proved an unsuitable leader: he was a soldier rather than a politician and was temperamental. He resented Cumann na nGaedheal&#x27;s drift from republicanism following Collins&#x27; death in 1922, and insisted that Fine Gael would not &quot;play second fiddle to anybody in the matter of Nationality&quot;. O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s nationalistic views alienated ex-Unionists who had supported Cumann na nGaedheal since the civil war, alarmed pro-Commonwealth moderates in Fine Gael, and resulted in O&#x27;Duffy being made the subject of an exclusion order in Northern Ireland. O&#x27;Duffy also clashed with his party on economic matters. Whereas Fine Gael favoured a return to pasture farming and free trade, O&#x27;Duffy was supportive of the experiments in tillage and protectionism implemented by his Fianna Fáil rivals, and was forced to attempt to compromise between the two.

His Fine Gael colleagues who regarded themselves as defenders of law-and-order were embarrassed by the Blueshirts&#x27; use of violence and attacks on the Gardaí, in addition to O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s connections with foreign fascist organisations and his view of the IRA as a communist group. O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s prestige was damaged when Fine Gael only won majorities on six councils to Fianna Fáil&#x27;s fifteen in the 1934 Irish local elections after O&#x27;Duffy had predicted taking twenty. The cost of Blueshirt activism also began to strain the party financially. O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s approval of illegal agitation against the collection of land annuities by the government, declaration of his support for a republic and the revelation of his connections with the British Union of Fascists and the Fedrelandslaget were the last straws for moderates in Fine Gael. On 5 and 7 September 1934 Cosgrave, Ned Cronin and James Dillon met O&#x27;Duffy resulting in an agreement that O&#x27;Duffy could &quot;deliver only carefully prepared and concise speeches from manuscripts&quot; and give interviews &quot;only after consultation and in writing&quot;. In response, O&#x27;Duffy resigned from the party on 18 September.

After his resignation, O&#x27;Duffy denounced Fine Gael as &quot;the pan-British party of the Free State&quot; and claimed he resigned &quot;because he was not prepared to lead the League of Youth with the Union Jack tied to his neck&quot;.

===Spanish Civil War===
At first, O&#x27;Duffy announced to the press that &quot;he was glad to be out of politics&quot;, but in October 1934 he announced his intentions to lead the Blueshirts as an independent movement. The Blueshirts split into two factions, one supporting O&#x27;Duffy and the other supporting Ned Cronin&#x27;s leadership. O&#x27;Duffy and Cronin toured the country attempting to win the support of local Blueshirt branches. By 1935, the Blueshirts had disintegrated. Seeking to regain his former political influence, O&#x27;Duffy attempted to court the IRA, encouraging his followers to wear Easter lilies and desist from informing on republicans. In June 1935, O&#x27;Duffy launched the National Corporate Party, a fascist political party inspired by Italy&#x27;s Mussolini. 

The following year, he organised an Irish Brigade to fight for the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. He was motivated to do so by Ireland&#x27;s historic link with Spain, his devout anti-communism and a will to defend Catholicism, stating &quot;It is not a conflict between fascism and anti-fascism but between Christ and antichrist&quot;. In London in September 1936, O&#x27;Duffy met Juan de la Cierva and Emilio Mola, promising he would recruit an Irish contingent to fight against the Republicans.

Despite the Irish Government advising against participation in the war, 700 of O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s followers went to Spain to fight on the Nationalist side. He later stated he had received over 7,000 applications but several complications meant only 700 of these made it to Spain. O&#x27;Duffy&#x27;s men saw little fighting and were sent home by Nationalist leader Francisco Franco, returning in June 1937. Franco had not been impressed by the Brigade&#x27;s lack of military expertise and there were bitter arguments among O&#x27;Duffy and his officers about the direction of the Brigade.

==Later life and death==
O&#x27;Duffy returned to Ireland from Spain in disarray. He wrote a book, &quot;Crusade in Spain&quot; (1938), about the Irish Brigade in Spain. The book had antisemitic undertones; O&#x27;Duffy wrote that trade unions are &quot;powerful political Jewish-Masonic organisations, directed and focused by the Communist International.&quot; He later congratulated General Franco for winning the Spanish Civil War; Franco thanked O&#x27;Duffy for his sending congratulations &quot;on the victory of the Spanish Army in defence of Christianity, occidental civilisation and humanity, over the forces of destruction and disorder.&quot;

In 1936 O&#x27;Duffy attended the founding meeting of Cumann Poblachta na hÉireann but never became a member. In 1940 he also attended the founding meeting of Córas na Poblachta along with former leaders of the Irish Christian Front. In 1939 &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that O&#x27;Duffy and his followers were trying to set up a new organisation however nothing materialised. He was subsequently put under surveillance by the G2.

In February 1939 he met up with Oskar Pfaus, a German spy whom he put in touch with the IRA. He also met the Italian diplomat Vincenzo Berardis. Berardis assessed O&#x27;Duffy as being a committed fascist and noted his approval of the S-Plan and his opposition to de Valera&#x27;s coercion against the IRA. A month later O&#x27;Duffy met Berardis again to solicit his support for a new fascist party that would unite Irish fascists and republicans. He is thought to have met with several leading IRA figures and German diplomat Eduard Hempel in a remote corner of County Donegal during the summer of 1939. G2 suspected O&#x27;Duffy was &quot;flirting with the IRA&quot; by acting as a negotiator between them and the Germans. At one point O&#x27;Duffy was offered a position as an IRA intelligence officer and on another occasion, he was invited to join former IRA Chiefs of Staff Moss Twomey and Andy Cooney in a protest against the &quot;Yankee invasion of the Six Counties&quot; in the summer of 1941.

In early November 1940, O&#x27;Duffy spoke with German spy Hermann Goertz in a meeting arranged by Seamus O&#x27;Donovan. O&#x27;Duffy made a good impression on Goertz and put him in contact with General Hugo MacNeill, who met with O&#x27;Duffy and German diplomat Henning Thomsen the next month to draw up a bilateral understanding between the Irish army and Germany in the event of a British invasion of Ireland.

In February-March 1943, transmissions were sent using Goertz&#x27;s code to the Abwehr in Berlin purportedly from an associate of O&#x27;Duffy which offered to raise a &#x27;Green Division&#x27; of volunteers to fight alongside the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front to &quot;fight against Bolshevism&quot;. The telegram was sent by Joseph Andrews, a man unconnected to O&#x27;Duffy, who had been attempting to extract money from the Germans. He was arrested in Dublin in December 1943. O&#x27;Duffy was unaware of the proposal made in his name by Andrews.

By this time O&#x27;Duffy had developed a serious drinking problem and his health had begun to seriously deteriorate; he died on 30 November 1944, aged 54. He received a state funeral. Following Requiem Mass in St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, he was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

In 2006 RTÉ aired a documentary entitled &quot;Eoin O&#x27;Duffy — An Irish Fascist&quot;.

<doc id="264696" wikidata="Q917080" url="?curid=264696" title="Vincent Lopez">
<text>Vincent Lopez (December 30, 1895 – September 20, 1975) was an American bandleader, actor, and pianist.

==Early life and education==
Lopez was born of Portuguese immigrant parents in Brooklyn, New York City, United States, and was leading his own dance band in New York City by 1916. On November 27, 1921, his band began broadcasting on the new medium of entertainment radio; the band&#x27;s weekly 90-minute show on the Newark, New Jersey, station WJZ boosted the popularity of both himself and of radio. He became one of North America&#x27;s most popular bandleaders, and would retain that status through the 1940s.

==Career==
He began his radio programs by announcing &quot;Hello everybody, Lopez speaking!&quot; His theme song was &quot;Nola&quot;, Felix Arndt&#x27;s novelty ragtime piece of 1915, and Lopez became so identified with it that he occasionally satirized it. (His 1939 movie short for Vitaphone, &quot;Vincent Lopez and his Orchestra&quot;, features the entire band singing &quot;Down with Nola&quot;.)

Lopez worked occasionally in feature films, notably &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; (1932) and as a live-action feature in the Max Fleischer cartoon &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Make History&quot; (1936). In 1940, he was one of the first bandleaders to work in Soundies movie musicals. He made additional Soundies in 1944.

Noted musicians who played in his band included Artie Shaw, Xavier Cugat, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Bob Effros, Mike Mosiello, Fred Lowery, Joe Tarto and Glenn Miller. He also featured singers Keller Sisters and Lynch, Betty Hutton, and Marion Hutton. Lopez&#x27;s longtime drummer was the irreverent Mike Riley, who popularized the novelty hit &quot;The Music Goes Round and Round&quot;.

Lopez&#x27;s flamboyant style of piano playing influenced such later musicians as Eddy Duchin and Liberace.

In 1941, Lopez&#x27;s Orchestra began a residency at the Taft Hotel in Manhattan that would last 25 years.

In the early 1950s, Lopez along with Gloria Parker hosted a radio program broadcast from the Taft Hotel called &quot;Shake the Maracas&quot; in which audience members competed for small prizes by playing maracas with the orchestra.

In 1960 he published his autobiography &quot;Lopez Speaking&quot;. Vincent Lopez died at the Villa Maria nursing home in North Miami, Florida, on September 20, 1975.

== Business interests ==
Lopez saw jazz and bandleading as a big business opportunity. Like rival Paul Whiteman had done a few years earlier with his United Orchestras, Inc, in 1924 he created the company Vincent Lopez, Inc, with a stated goal of starting jazz orchestras and schools in major North American cities, and managing copyrights. By 1926 the endeavor became insolvent, and to avoid bankruptcy Lopez, Inc went into partnership with Eugene Geiger&#x27;s Eldorado Finance Co.

In 1927, he partnered with other major bandleaders Paul Whiteman, Ben Bernie, George Olson, Roger Kahn, Fred Rich, B. A. Rolfe, and Ernie Golden to launch the trade union National Association of Orchestra Leaders. They hired Julian T. Abeles at an annual salary of $25,000; his stated goal was to stop competition among their orchestras for musicians, contracts, and bookings. In practice this was a labor cartel, and the NAOL&#x27;s efforts and lawsuits on behalf of orchestra leaders and owners continued into the 21st century.

<doc id="264705" wikidata="Q10447" url="?curid=264705" title="Erlangen-Höchstadt">
<text>Erlangen-Höchstadt is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Bavaria, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Fürth, Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim, Bamberg, Forchheim and Nürnberger Land, and by the cities of Nuremberg and Erlangen. The city of Erlangen is not part of the district, but nonetheless its administrative seat.

==History==

The earliest extant documents are drawings from 1413 which show water wheels along the Regnitz. The first (1449–1450) and second (1552–1555) Margrave wars, Brandenburg versus Nuremberg, devastated the countryside.

In 1715 a lock was placed in the Regnitz river at Hemhofen. The highpoint of waterwheel usage was in the early 19th century when more than 190 were in use between Fuerth and Forchheim.

The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Erlangen and Höchstadt.

==Geography==

The main river is the Regnitz, which runs through the city of Erlangen. Lands west of the river are covered with several hundred tiny lakes on both sides of the Aisch. The Aisch is an affluent of the Regnitz, running from southwest to east. East of the river the country is rising to the hills of the northern Frankish Alb.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the lion of the clerical state of Bamberg, which ruled the district&#x27;s western half until 1802
* the red and white border of the right half is taken from the arms of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (see Bayreuth)
* the blue and gold colours of the right half are identical to the heraldic colours of Nuremberg
* the image in the right half symbolises a watermill on the river Regnitz

<doc id="264706" wikidata="Q826312" url="?curid=264706" title="New Jersey Route 147">
<text>Route 147 is a state highway located in Cape May County in New Jersey, United States. It is a short connector between U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in Middle Township and North Wildwood at New York Avenue. West of US 9, the road continues to Route 47 as County Route 618 (CR 618, Indian Trail Road); this route along with Route 147 provides an alternate route to The Wildwoods from Route 47. East of New York Avenue, the route continues south through The Wildwoods as CR 621 (New Jersey Avenue). The route passes through mostly marshland along its journey, intersecting the Garden State Parkway at a partial interchange and CR 619 (Ocean Drive).

The portion of the route east of the intersection with the latter forms a part of Ocean Drive. When the 500-series county routes were established in New Jersey in the 1950s, what is now Route 147 became a part of CR 585, a route running from Lower Township north to Absecon. On November 1, 1971, Route 147 was designated along CR 585 between US 9 and the North Wildwood border. The route was extended to its current location in North Wildwood by the 1990s.

==Route description==
 Route 147 begins at an intersection with US 9 in the Burleigh section of Middle Township, heading to the east along North Wildwood Boulevard, a two-lane undivided road. The road continues to the west of US 9 as CR 618 (Indian Trail Road) to Route 47. The road passes residences and businesses to the north and woodland to the south before coming to a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Garden State Parkway that has access to the northbound direction of the parkway and from the southbound direction of the parkway.
Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 147 becomes a four-lane divided highway that briefly passes more homes and commercial establishments before entering a delta-type series of marshy rivers and inlets. It turns to the southeast and comes to an intersection with CR 665 before crossing the Grassy Sound on a bridge. After the bridge, the route comes to an intersection with the southern terminus of CR 619 (Ocean Drive).

At this point, the Ocean Drive moniker merges onto Route 147 and the road crosses over the Beach Creek into the Jersey Shore city of North Wildwood. Here, the route turns south and becomes Spruce Avenue, which heads between marshland to the west and homes to the east. At the intersection with West Angelsea Drive, Route 147 becomes a four-lane undivided road that continues past more developments, turning to the southeast. Route 147 heads through a mix of residential and commercial establishments before ending at the intersection with New York Avenue. From here, CR 621 continues south along the roadway as New Jersey Avenue. Route 147, along with CR 618, provide an alternate route to The Wildwoods from Route 47.

==History==

What is now Route 147 was an unimproved road back in 1927. When the 500-series county routes were established in the 1950s, this road became a part of CR 585, a route that ran from Route 109 (then a part of US 9) in Lower Township north to US 30 and Route 157 in Absecon. The route was also designated as part of CR 18, which continued west past US 9 to Route 47. On November 1, 1971, Route 147 was designated to replace the portion of CR 18/CR 585 between US 9 in Burleigh and the North Wildwood border. In 1994, the current fixed-span steel girder bridge over the Grassy Sound was built. As a result of the bridge replacement, Route 147 was realigned off its former drawbridge, and the former alignment became CR 665. The southern terminus of CR 585 was eventually truncated its current location at Route 52 in Somers Point. By the 1990s, Route 147 was extended to its current terminus at New York Avenue in North Wildwood.

In 2020, NJTA proposed a $10 million project to reconstruct the partial interchange between Route 147 and the Garden State Parkway into a full interchange.

<text>Route 152 is a state highway in Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States. Route 152 begins at Bay Avenue in Somers Point as a continuation of County Route 620 (CR 620). The route heads along two causeways, ending at the foot of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway in Egg Harbor Township, where the state turns maintenance back to Atlantic County as CR 629 to Longport.

Route 152 originates as an alignment of County Route 20, which ran along the entire alignment of Route 152 from Somers Point to Longport. The state took over CR 20 in 1969, designating the route as Route 152 in relation to the Route 52 designation further south. In 1988, the former bridge over the Broad Thoroughfare was demolished and replaced by the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge.

==Route description==
Route 152 begins at an intersection with CR 620 (West Maryland Avenue) and Bay Avenue in the city of Somers Point. The route heads eastward, passing to the north of a local marina as East Maryland Avenue, crossing over Bass Harbor Creek soon after. Just after crossing the creek, Route 152 leaves Somers Point, entering the community of Egg Harbor Township. On the other side of the creek, Route 152 becomes known as Longport–Somers Point Boulevard and heads along a causeway through Egg Harbor Township. The route passes to the north of a marina, curving soon after at an intersection with Anchorage Drive, which is a connector road to waterside residential homes.

Route 152 continues eastward, crossing over several streams and passing to the north of a large estate. The route remains a two-lane causeway for a distance, intersecting with its former alignment to the south, which parallels the current route. Route 152 then rises in elevation as it heads onto the newer causeway (known as the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge), passing a lone fishing pier. After crossing over the Cooper Bridge, the highway parallels its former alignment for a short distance, intersecting with the Ocean Drive/Ocean City-Longport Boulevard. Route 152 heads along the Broad Thoroughfare as a three-lane waterside arterial boulevard. The route leaves the shoreline, running along the sandy surroundings. The route reaches Seaview Harbor, served by an intersection with Sunset Boulevard and Seaview Boulevard. Route 152 turns eastward, reaching the foot of the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge. There, the state designation ends, and it continues as CR 629 (Ventnor Avenue) into the borough of Longport.

The entire span of the Longport Bridge is accessible to pedestrians, runners, and bicycles, with dedicated lanes on each side. The bridge has been a featured route in running, walking, and cycling events including the Bike MS: City to Shore Ride.

==History==

In 1916, the causeway connecting Somers Point and Longport opened. The current alignment of Route 152 originates as a state takeover of CR 20, which was first brought to the floor of the New Jersey State Legislature in 1968. The state approved the measure, and effective January 19, 1969, the New Jersey Department of Transportation took over maintenance of CR 20. The alignment was designated as Route 152, numbered after nearby Route 52 to the south in Somers Point and Ocean City.

Route 152 originally went along a lower wooden bridge across the Broad Thoroughfare. At least six people drowned from traffic accidents along the bridge from 1976 to 1986. Atlantic County Assemblywoman Dolores G. Cooper helped secure state funding for a new bridge, which opened September 1988 at a cost of $21 million. The new bridge was completed to the north of the former route. The former alignment to the south, designated as Old Road, is currently being demolished with the former fishing pier as of 2017. 
The route has remained intact virtually since 1988. In 1994, the new bridge was named the Dolores G. Cooper Bridge.

The original alignment of Route 152 was designated by 1953 from Route 29 (which at the time went east via Memorial Drive and Lafayette Street to U.S. Route 206, US 206) in Trenton to US 1 in Trenton. This became part of rerouted Route 29 by 1969, while the old route of Route 29 was given to the city.

<text>Route 154 is a state highway in Cherry Hill Township, Camden County, New Jersey. The route begins at an intersection with County Route 561 (CR 561) in Cherry Hill, heading northward to the site of the former Ellisburg Circle, where Route 154 reaches its northern terminus at Route 41 (Kings Highway) and Route 70. The route ends concurrent with Route 41 for the short distance from the junction between the two routes. Brace Road is the local name for Route 154 for its entire length.

Route 154 is an original portion of Route 41, defined in the 1927 renumbering. The route remained intact for several decades, until the construction of a bypass around Haddonfield. By the time of the 1953 renumbering on January 1, 1953, Route 41 was realigned onto a county-maintained roadway, signed as Temporary Route 41, while the former alignment went unnumbered. During the 1960s, the old alignment was designated as Route 154, but was unsigned until 1992. From 1984 to 1992, the New Jersey Department of Transportation removed the Ellisburg Circle, built in 1938 at Route 154&#x27;s northern terminus.

==Route description==

Route 154 begins at an intersection with CR 561 (Haddonfield-Berlin Road) in the township of Cherry Hill. The site of the former Cherry Hill Arena, now occupied by a shopping center, lies on the route&#x27;s east side at its beginning. The highway progresses northward as Brace Road, passing through some large commercial districts and to the east of Tyndall Village. The route continues, passing several small commercial businesses until approaching an intersection with CR 671 (Kresson Road) in the northeast portion of Tyndall Village. Route 154 continues northward, passing to the east of several more commercial buildings, while the surroundings become woodland to the northwest and east for a short distance. The route continues northward, passing Kingsway Circle Park before becoming moderately developed with homes and businesses.

After the intersection with Munn Lane West, Route 154 becomes surrounded by large, deep patches of trees until the intersection with Kenwood Drive, where residential homes return. At the intersection, Route 154 gains its own service road for the local residences, which terminate a block away. A short distance later, Route 41 comes in from the west and becomes concurrent with Route 154 for a short distance. Passing some large businesses in Ellisburg, a part of Cherry Hill, Route 41 and Route 154 intersect with Route 70, where Route 154&#x27;s designation terminates.

==History==

The alignment of Route 154 was originally a stretch of Route 41 through Cherry Hill and Ellisburg assigned in the 1927 renumbering of state highways. The route went from its current alignment along former Route 25 to current Route 154 instead of via the Kings Highway. The route remained intact until plans for a bypass around Haddonfield arose in 1929. By the second state highway renumbering in 1953, the bypass around Haddonfield had only been partially built, so instead, the New Jersey State Highway Department realigned Route 41 onto the Kings Highway, leaving the former route unnumbered. The route remained unnumbered until the 1960s, when it was given the designation of Route 154.

In 1938, the State Highway Department tore down the Ellisburg General Store, a market located at the intersection of then-Route 41 and Route 40 (now Route 70) to construct a new traffic circle at the junction. This circle, known as the Ellisburg Circle, was removed in 1992, while plans arose in the late 1980s to remove the congested circle, hosting the junctions of Route 154, 41, and 70. The impetus to remove the structure and replace it with a four-way intersection was produced in 1987, with a cost of $8 million (1987 USD) to rebuild.

<text>The &quot;Iowa&quot; class was a class of six fast battleships ordered by the United States Navy in 1939 and 1940. They were initially intended to intercept fast capital ships such as the Japanese and serve as the &quot;fast wing&quot; of the U.S. battle line. The &quot;Iowa&quot; class was designed to meet the Second London Naval Treaty&#x27;s &quot;escalator clause&quot; limit of standard displacement. Beginning in August 1942, four vessels, , , , and , were completed; two more, and , were laid down but canceled in 1945 and 1958, respectively, before completion, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958–1959.

The four &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships were the last battleships commissioned in the U.S. Navy. All older U.S. battleships were decommissioned by 1947 and stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; (NVR) by 1963. Between the mid-1940s and the early 1990s, the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships fought in four major U.S. wars. In the Pacific Theater of World War II, they served primarily as fast escorts for s of the Fast Carrier Task Force and also shelled Japanese positions. During the Korean War, the battleships provided naval gunfire support (NGFS) for United Nations forces, and in 1968, &quot;New Jersey&quot; shelled Viet Cong and Vietnam People&#x27;s Army forces in the Vietnam War. All four were reactivated and modernized at the direction of the United States Congress in 1981, and armed with missiles during the 1980s, as part of the 600-ship Navy initiative. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; fired missiles and guns at Iraqi targets.

Costly to maintain, the battleships were decommissioned during the post-Cold War drawdown in the early 1990s. All four were initially removed from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot;, but the United States Congress compelled the Navy to reinstate two of them on the grounds that existing shore bombardment capability would be inadequate for amphibious operations. This resulted in a lengthy debate over whether battleships should have a role in the modern navy. Ultimately, all four ships were stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; and released for donation to non-profit organizations. With the transfer of &quot;Iowa&quot; in 2012, all four are museum ships part of non-profit maritime museums across the US.

==Background==
The vessels that eventually became the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships were born from the U.S. Navy&#x27;s War Plan Orange, a Pacific war plan against Japan. War planners anticipated that the U.S. fleet would engage and advance in the Central Pacific, with a long line of communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed Japanese cruisers and capital ships. The chief concern was that the U.S. Navy&#x27;s traditional 21-knot battle line of &quot;Standard-type&quot; battleships would be too slow to force these Japanese task forces into battle, while faster aircraft carriers and their cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the Japanese battlecruisers, which had been upgraded in the 1930s to fast battleships. As a result, the U.S. Navy envisioned a fast detachment of the battle line that could bring the Japanese fleet into battle. Even the new standard battle line speed of 27 knots, as the preceding and battleships were designed for, was not considered enough and during their development processes, designs that could achieve over 30 knots in order to counter the threat of fast &quot;big gun&quot; ships were seriously considered. At the same time, a special strike force consisting of fast battleships operating alongside carriers and destroyers was being envisaged; such a force could operate independently in advance areas and act as scouts. This concept eventually evolved into the Fast Carrier Task Force, though initially the carriers were believed to be subordinate to the battleship.

Another factor was the &quot;escalator clause&quot; of the Second London Naval Treaty, which reverted the gun caliber limit from to . Japan had refused to sign the treaty and in particular refused to accept the 14-inch gun caliber limit or the 5:5:3 ratio of warship tonnage limits for Britain, the United States, and Japan, respectively. This resulted in the three treaty powers, the United States, Britain, and France, invoking the caliber escalator clause after April 1937. Circulation of intelligence evidence in November 1937 of Japanese capital ships violating naval treaties caused the treaty powers to expand the escalator clause in June 1938, which amended the standard displacement limit of battleships from to .

== Design ==

===Early studies===
Work on what would eventually become the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleship began on the first studies in early 1938, at the direction of Admiral Thomas C. Hart, head of the General Board, following the planned invocation of the &quot;escalator clause&quot; that would permit maximum standard capital ship displacement of . Using the additional over previous designs, the studies included schemes for &quot;slow&quot; battleships that increased armament and protection as well as &quot;fast&quot; battleships capable of or more. One of the &quot;slow&quot; designs was an expanded &quot;South Dakota&quot; class carrying either twelve 16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns or nine /48 guns and with more armor and a power plant large enough to drive the larger ship through the water at the same 27-knot maximum speed as the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s. While the &quot;fast&quot; studies would result in the &quot;Iowa&quot; class, the &quot;slow&quot; design studies would eventually settle on twelve 16-inch guns and evolve into the design for the after all treaty restrictions were removed following the start of World War II. Priority was given to the &quot;fast&quot; design in order to counter and defeat Japan&#x27;s &quot;Kongō&quot;-class fast battleships, whose higher speed advantage over existing U.S. battleships might let them &quot;penetrate U.S. cruisers, thereby making it &#x27;open season&#x27; on U.S. supply ships&quot;, and then overwhelm the Japanese battle line was therefore a major driving force in setting the design criteria for the new ships, as was the restricting width of the Panama Canal.

For &quot;fast&quot; battleships, one such design, pursued by the Design Division section of the Bureau of Construction and Repair, was a &quot;cruiser-killer&quot;. Beginning on 17 January 1938, under Captain A.J. Chantry, the group drew up plans for ships with twelve 16-inch and twenty guns, Panamax capability but otherwise unlimited displacement, a top speed of and a range of when traveling at the more economical speed of . Their plan fulfilled these requirements with a ship of standard displacement, but Chantry believed that more could be done if the ship were to be this large; with a displacement greater than that of most battleships, its armor would have protected it only against the weapons carried by heavy cruisers.

Three improved plans – &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; – were designed at the end of January. An increase in draft, vast additions to the armor, and the substitution of twelve guns in the secondary battery were common among the three designs. &quot;A&quot; was the largest, at standard, and was the only one to still carry the twelve 16-inch guns in four triple turrets (3-gun turrets according to US Navy). It required to make . &quot;B&quot; was the smallest at standard; like &quot;A&quot; it had a top speed of 32.5 knots, but &quot;B&quot; only required to make this speed. It also carried only nine 16-inch guns, in three triple turrets. &quot;C&quot; was similar but added (for a total of ) to meet the original requirement of . The weight required for this and a longer belt – , compared with for &quot;B&quot; – meant that the ship was standard.

===Design history===
In March 1938, the General Board followed the recommendations of the Battleship Design Advisory Board, which was composed of the naval architect William Francis Gibbs, William Hovgaard (then president of New York Shipbuilding), John Metten, Joseph W. Powell, and the long-retired Admiral and former Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance Joseph Strauss. The board requested an entirely new design study, again focusing on increasing the size of the &quot;South Dakota&quot; class. The first plans made for this indicated that was possible on a standard displacement of about . could be bought with and a standard displacement of around , which was well below the London Treaty&#x27;s &quot;escalator clause&quot; maximum limit of .

These designs were able to convince the General Board that a reasonably well-designed and balanced 33-knot &quot;fast&quot; battleship was possible within the terms of the &quot;escalator clause&quot;. However, further studies revealed major problems with the estimates. The speed of the ships meant that more freeboard would be needed both fore and amidships, the latter requiring an additional foot of armored freeboard. Along with this came the associated weight in supporting these new strains: the structure of the ship had to be reinforced and the power plant enlarged to avoid a drop in speed. In all, about had to be added, and the large margin the navy designers had previously thought they had – roughly – was suddenly vanishing. The draft of the ships was also allowed to increase, which enabled the beam to narrow and thus reduced the required power (since a lower beam-to-draft ratio reduces wave-making resistance). This also allowed the ships to be shortened, which reduced weight.

With the additional displacement, the General Board was incredulous that a tonnage increase of would allow only the addition of over the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s. Rather than retaining the 16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 guns used in the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s, they ordered that the preliminary design would have to include the more powerful but significantly heavier 16-inch/50 caliber Mark 2 guns left over from the canceled s and battleships of the early 1920s.

The 16&quot;/50 turret weighed some more than the 16&quot;/45 turret already in use and also had a larger barbette diameter of compared to the latter&#x27;s barbette diameter of , so the total weight gain was about . This put the ship at a total of – well over the limit. An apparent savior appeared in a Bureau of Ordnance preliminary design for a turret that could carry the 50-caliber guns and also fit in the smaller barbette of the 45-caliber gun turret. Other weight savings were achieved by thinning some armor elements and substituting construction steel with armor-grade Special Treatment Steel (STS) in certain areas. The net savings reduced the preliminary design displacement to standard, though the margin remained tight. This breakthrough was shown to the General Board as part of a series of designs on 2 June 1938.

However, the Bureau of Ordnance continued working on the turret with the larger barbette, while the Bureau of Construction and Repair used the smaller barbettes in the contract design of the new battleships. As the bureaus were independent of one another, they did not realize that the two plans could not go together until November 1938, when the contract design was in the final stages of refinement. By this time, the ships could not use the larger barbette, as it would require extensive alterations to the design and would result in substantial weight penalties. Reverting to the 45-caliber gun was also deemed unacceptable. The General Board was astounded; one member asked the head of the Bureau of Ordnance if it had occurred to him that Construction and Repair would have wanted to know what turret his subordinates were working on &quot;as a matter of common sense&quot;. A complete scrapping of plans was avoided only when designers within the Bureau of Ordnance were able to design a new 50-caliber gun, the Mark 7, that was both lighter and smaller in outside diameter; this allowed it to be placed in a turret that would fit in the smaller barbette. The redesigned 3-gun turret, equipped as it was with the Mark 7 naval gun, provided an overall weight saving of nearly to the overall design of the &quot;Iowa&quot; class. The contract design displacement subsequently stood at standard and full load.

In May 1938, the United States Congress passed the Second Vinson Act, which &quot;mandated a 20% increase in strength of the United States Navy&quot;. The act was sponsored by Carl Vinson, a Democratic Congressman from Georgia who was Chairman of the House Naval Affairs and Armed Services Committee. The Second Vinson Act updated the provisions of the Vinson-Trammell Act of 1934 and the Naval Act of 1936, which had &quot;authorized the construction of the first American battleships in 17 years&quot;, based on the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930; this act was quickly signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and provided the funding to build the &quot;Iowa&quot; class. Each ship cost approximately US$100 million.

As 1938 drew to a close, the contract design of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s was nearly complete, but it would continuously evolve as the New York Navy Yard, the lead shipyard, conducted the final detail design. These revisions included changing the design of the foremast, replacing the original /75-caliber guns that were to be used for anti-aircraft (AA) work with /70 caliber Oerlikon cannons and /56 caliber Bofors guns, and moving the combat information center into the armored hull. Additionally, in November 1939, the New York Navy Yard greatly modified the internal subdivision of the machinery rooms, as tests had shown the underwater protection in these rooms to be inadequate. The longitudinal subdivision of these rooms was doubled, and the result of this was clearly beneficial: &quot;The prospective effect of flooding was roughly halved and the number of uptakes and hence of openings in the third deck greatly reduced.&quot; Although the changes meant extra weight and increasing the beam by to , this was no longer a major issue; Britain and France had renounced the Second London Naval Treaty soon after the beginning of the Second World War. The design displacement was standard, approximately 2% overweight, when &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; were laid down in June and September 1940. By the time the &quot;Iowa&quot;s were completed and commissioned in 1943–44, the considerable increase in anti-aircraft armament – along with their associated splinter protection and crew accommodations – and additional electronics had increased standard displacement to some , while full load displacement became .

==Specifications==

=== General characteristics ===
The &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships are long at the waterline and long overall with a beam of . During World War II, the draft was at full load displacement of and at design combat displacement of . Like the two previous classes of American fast battleships, the &quot;Iowa&quot;s have a double bottom hull that becomes a triple bottom under the armored citadel and armored skegs around the inboard shafts. The dimensions of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s were strongly influenced by speed. When the Second Vinson Act was passed by the United States Congress in 1938, the U.S. Navy moved quickly to develop a 45,000-ton-standard battleship that would pass through the wide Panama Canal. Drawing on a 1935 empirical formula for predicting a ship&#x27;s maximum speed based on scale-model studies in flumes of various hull forms and propellers and a newly developed empirical theorem that related waterline length to maximum beam, the Navy drafted plans for a battleship class with a maximum beam of which, when multiplied by 7.96, produced a waterline length of . The Navy also called for the class to have a lengthened forecastle and amidship, which would increase speed, and a bulbous bow.

The &quot;Iowa&quot;s exhibit good stability, making them steady gun platforms. At design combat displacement, the ships&#x27; (GM) metacentric height was . They also have excellent maneuverability in the open water for their size, while seakeeping is described as good, but not outstanding. In particular, the long fine bow and sudden widening of the hull just in front of the foremost turret contributed to the ships being rather wet for their size. This hull form also resulted in very intense spray formations, which led to some difficulty refueling escorting destroyers.

=== Armament ===
====Main battery====

The primary guns used on these battleships are the nine /50-caliber Mark 7 naval guns, a compromise design developed to fit inside the barbettes. These guns fire high explosive- and armor-piercing shells and can fire a 16-inch shell approximately .&lt;ref name=&quot;NavWeaps 16/50&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The guns are housed in three 3-gun turrets: two forward of the battleship&#x27;s superstructure and one aft, in a configuration known as &quot;2-A-1&quot;. The guns are long (50 times their 16-inch bore, or 50 calibers from breechface to muzzle). About protrudes from the gun house. Each gun weighs about without the breech, or with the breech. They fired armor-piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , or high-capacity projectiles at , up to . At maximum range, the projectile spends almost  minutes in flight. The maximum firing rate for each gun is two rounds per minute.

Each gun rests within an armored turret, but only the top of the turret protrudes above the main deck. The turret extends either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contain rooms for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. Each turret required a crew of between 85 and 110 men to operate. The original cost for each turret was US$1.4 million, but this figure does not take into account the cost of the guns themselves. The turrets are &quot;three-gun&quot;, not &quot;triple&quot;, because each barrel is individually sleeved and can be elevated and fired independently. The ship could fire any combination of its guns, including a broadside of all nine. The fire control was performed by the Mark 38 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS); the firing solutions were computed with the Mark 8 rangekeeper, an analog computer that automatically receives information from the director and Mark 8/13 fire control radar, stable vertical, ship pitometer log and gyrocompass, and anemometer. The GFCS uses remote power control (RPC) for automatic gun laying.

The large-caliber guns were designed to fire two different conventional 16-inch shells: the Mk 8 &quot;Super-heavy&quot; APC (Armor Piercing, Capped) shell for anti-ship and anti-structure work, and the Mk 13 high-explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. When firing the same conventional shell, the 16-inch/45 caliber Mark 6 used by the fast battleships of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;South Dakota&quot; classes had a slight advantage over the 16-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 gun when hitting deck armor – a shell from a 45 cal gun would be slower, meaning that it would have a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45 cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45.2 degrees, as opposed to 36 degrees with the 50 cal.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavWeaps 16/45&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Mark 7 had a greater maximum range over the Mark 6: vs .

In the 1950s, the W23, an adaptation of the W19 nuclear artillery shell, was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell weighed , had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships&#x27; 16-inch guns the world&#x27;s largest nuclear artillery and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to have nuclear shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship&#x27;s guns it is not known if any of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy&#x27;s policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991, the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its nuclear artillery shells from service, and the dismantling of the US nuclear artillery inventory is said to have been completed in 2004.

====Secondary battery====
The &quot;Iowa&quot;s carried twenty /38 caliber Mark 12 guns in ten Mark 28 Mod 2 enclosed base ring mounts. Originally designed to be mounted upon destroyers built in the 1930s, these guns were so successful that they were added to many American ships during the Second World War, including every major ship type and many smaller warships constructed between 1934 and 1945. They were considered to be &quot;highly reliable, robust and accurate&quot; by the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Ordnance.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavWeaps 5/38&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Each 5-inch/38 gun weighed almost without the breech; the entire mount weighed . It was long overall, had a bore length of , and a rifling length of . The gun could fire shells at about ; about 4,600 could be fired before the barrel needed to be replaced. Minimum and maximum elevations were −15 and 85 degrees, respectively. The guns&#x27; elevation could be raised or lowered at about 15 degrees per second. The mounts closest to the bow and stern could aim from −150 to 150 degrees; the others were restricted to −80 to 80 degrees. They could be turned at about 25 degrees per second. The mounts were directed by four Mark 37 fire control systems primarily through remote power control (RPC).

The 5-inch/38 gun functioned as a dual-purpose gun (DP); that is, it was able to fire at both surface and air targets with a reasonable degree of success. However, this did not mean that it possessed inferior anti-air abilities. As proven during 1941 gunnery tests conducted aboard the gun could consistently shoot down aircraft flying at , twice the effective range of the earlier single-purpose 5-inch/25 caliber AA gun. As Japanese airplanes became faster, the gun lost some of its effectiveness in the anti-aircraft role; however, toward the end of the war, its usefulness as an anti-aircraft weapon increased again because of an upgrade to the Mark 37 Fire Control System, Mark 1A computer, and proximity-fused shells.

The 5-inch/38 gun would remain on the battleships for the ships&#x27; entire service life; however, the total number of guns and gun mounts was reduced from twenty guns in ten mounts to twelve guns in six mounts during the 1980s&#x27; modernization of the four &quot;Iowa&quot;s. The removal of four of the gun mounts was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to carry and fire Tomahawk missiles. At the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts.

====Anti-air battery====

At the time of their commissioning, all four of the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships were equipped with 20 quad 40 mm mounts and 49 single 20 mm mounts. These guns were respectively augmented with the Mk 14 range sight and Mk 51 fire control system to improve accuracy.

The Oerlikon gun, one of the most heavily produced anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War, entered service in 1941 and replaced the M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis. Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon, with the high point being 48.3% for the second half of 1942; however, the 20 mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II and were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier Bofors AA gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavWeaps 20mm/70&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships were commissioned in 1943 and 1944, they carried twenty quad 40 mm AA gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy AA guns were also employed in the protection of Allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II, and accounted for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;NavWeaps 40mm/56&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NavWeaps 3/50&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although successful in this role against WWII aircraft, the 40 mm guns were stripped from the battleships in the jet age – initially from &quot;New Jersey&quot; when reactivated in 1968 and later from &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Missouri,&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; when they were reactivated for service in the 1980s.

=== Propulsion ===
The powerplant of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s consists of eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers and four sets of double reduction cross-compound geared turbines, with each turbine set driving a single shaft. Specifically, the geared turbines on &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; were provided by General Electric, while the equivalent machinery on &quot;New Jersey&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was provided by Westinghouse. The plant produced and propelled the ship up to a maximum speed of at full load displacement and at normal displacement. The ships carried of fuel oil which gave a range of at . Two semi-balanced rudders gave the ships a tactical turning diameter of at and at .

The machinery spaces were longitudinally divided into eight compartments with alternating fire and engine rooms to ensure adequate isolation of machinery components. Four fire rooms each contained two M-Type boilers operating at with a maximum superheater outlet temperature of . The double-expansion engines consist of a high-pressure (HP) turbine and a low-pressure (LP) turbine. The steam is first passed through the HP turbine which turns at up to 2,100 rpm. The steam, largely depleted at this point, is then passed through a large conduit to the LP turbine. By the time it reaches the LP turbine, it has no more than of pressure left. The LP turbine increases efficiency and power by extracting the last little bit of energy from the steam. After leaving the LP turbine, the exhaust steam passes into a condenser and is then returned as feed water to the boilers. Water lost in the process is replaced by three evaporators, which can make a total of 60,000 US gallons per day (3 liters per second) of fresh water. After the boilers have had their fill, the remaining fresh water is fed to the ship&#x27;s potable water systems for drinking, showers, hand washing, cooking, etc. All of the urinals and all but one of the toilets on the &quot;Iowa&quot; class flush with salt water in order to conserve fresh water. The turbines, especially the HP turbine, can turn at 2,000 rpm; their shafts drive through reduction gearing that turns the propeller shafts at speeds up to 225 rpm, depending upon the desired speed of the ship. The &quot;Iowa&quot;s were outfitted with four screws: the outboard pair consisting of four-bladed propellers in diameter and the inboard pair consisting of five-bladed propellers in diameter. The propeller designs were adopted after earlier testing had determined that propeller cavitation caused a drop in efficiency at speeds over . The two inner shafts were housed in skegs to smooth the flow of water to the propellers and improve the structural strength of the stern.

Each of the four engine rooms has a pair of 1,250 kW Ship&#x27;s Service Turbine Generators (SSTGs), providing the ship with a total non-emergency electrical power of 10,000 kW at 450 volts alternating current. Additionally, the vessels have a pair of 250 kW emergency diesel generators. To allow battle-damaged electrical circuits to be repaired or bypassed, the lower decks of the ship have a Casualty Power System whose large 3-wire cables and wall outlets called &quot;biscuits&quot; can be used to reroute power.

===Electronics (1943–69)===
The earliest search radars installed were the SK air-search radar and SG surface-search radar during World War II. They were located on the mainmast and forward fire-control tower of the battleships, respectively. As the war drew to a close, the United States introduced the SK-2 air-search radar and SG surface-search radar; the &quot;Iowa&quot; class was updated to make use of these systems between 1945 and 1952. At the same time, the ships&#x27; radar systems were augmented with the installation of the SP height finder on the main mast. In 1952, AN/SPS-10 surface-search radar and AN/SPS-6 air-search radar replaced the SK and SG radar systems, respectively. Two years later the SP height finder was replaced by the AN/SPS-8 height finder, which was installed on the main mast of the battleships.

In addition to these search and navigational radars, the &quot;Iowa&quot; class were also outfitted with a variety of fire control radars for their gun systems. Beginning with their commissioning, the battleships made use of a pair of Mk 38 gun fire control systems with Mark 8 fire control radar to direct the 16-inch guns and a quartet of Mk 37 gun fire control systems with Mark 12 fire control radar and Mark 22 height finding radar to direct the 5-inch gun batteries. These systems were upgraded over time with the Mark 13 replacing the Mark 8 and the Mark 25 replacing the Mark 12/22, but they remained the cornerstones of the combat radar systems on the &quot;Iowa&quot; class during their careers. The range estimation of these gunfire control systems provided a significant accuracy advantage over earlier ships with optical rangefinders; this was demonstrated off Truk Atoll on 16 February 1944, when the &quot;New Jersey&quot; engaged the at a range of and straddled her, setting the record for the longest-ranged straddle in history.

In World War II, the electronic countermeasures (ECM) included the SPT-1 and SPT-4 equipment; passive electronic support measures (ESM) were a pair of DBM radar direction finders and three intercept receiving antennas, while the active components were the TDY-1 jammers located on the sides of the fire control tower. The ships were also equipped with the identification, friend or foe (IFF) Mark III system, which was replaced by the IFF Mark X when the ships were overhauled in 1955. When the &quot;New Jersey&quot; was reactivated in 1968 for the Vietnam War, she was outfitted with the ULQ-6 ECM system.

=== Armor ===
Like all battleships, the &quot;Iowa&quot;s carried heavy armor protection against shellfire and bombs with significant underwater protection against torpedoes. The &quot;Iowa&quot;s&#x27; &quot;all-or-nothing&quot; armor scheme was largely modeled on that of the preceding &quot;South Dakota&quot; class, and designed to give a zone of immunity against fire from 16-inch/45-caliber guns between away. The protection system consists of Class A face-hardened Krupp cemented (K.C.) armor and Class B homogeneous Krupp-type armor; furthermore, special treatment steel (STS), a high-tensile structural steel with armor properties comparable to Class B, was extensively used in the hull plating to increase protection.

The citadel consisting of the magazines and engine rooms was protected by an STS outer hull plating thick and a Class A armor belt thick mounted on STS backing plate; the armor belt is sloped at 19 degrees, equivalent to of vertical class B armor at 19,000 yards. The armor belt extends to the triple bottom, where the Class B lower portion tapers to . The ends of the armored citadel are closed by vertical Class A transverse bulkheads for &quot;Iowa&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot;. The transverse bulkhead armor on &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was increased to ; this extra armor provided protection from raking fire directly ahead, which was considered more likely given the high speed of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s. The deck armor consists of a STS weather deck, a combined Class B and STS main armor deck, and a STS splinter deck. Over the magazines, the splinter deck is replaced by a STS third deck that separates the magazine from the main armored deck. The powder magazine rooms are separated from the turret platforms by a pair of 1.5-inch STS annular bulkheads under the barbettes for flashback protection. The installation of armor on the &quot;Iowa&quot;s also differed from those of earlier battleships in that the armor was installed while the ships were still &quot;on the way&quot; rather than after the ships had been launched.

The &quot;Iowa&quot;s had heavily protected main battery turrets, with Class B and STS face, Class A sides, Class A rear, and Class B roof. The turret barbettes&#x27; armor is Class A with abeam and facing the centerline, extending down to the main armor deck. The conning tower armor is Class B with on all sides and on the roof. The secondary battery turrets and handling spaces were protected by of STS. The propulsion shafts and steering gear compartment behind the citadel had considerable protection, with Class A side strake and roof.

The armor&#x27;s immunity zone shrank considerably against guns equivalent to their own 16-inch/50-caliber guns armed with the Mk 8 armor-piercing shell due to the weapon&#x27;s increased muzzle velocity and improved shell penetration; increasing the armor would have increased weight and reduced speed, a compromise that the General Board was not willing to make.

The &quot;Iowa&quot;s&#x27; torpedo defense was based on the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s&#x27; design, with modifications to address shortcomings discovered during caisson tests. The system is an internal &quot;bulge&quot; that consists of four longitudinal torpedo bulkheads behind the outer hull plating with a system depth of to absorb the energy of a torpedo warhead. The extension of the armor belt to the triple bottom, where it tapers to a thickness of , serves as one of the torpedo bulkheads and was hoped to add to protection; the belt&#x27;s lower edge was welded to the triple bottom structure and the joint was reinforced with buttstraps due to the slight knuckle causing a structural discontinuity. The torpedo bulkheads were designed to elastically deform to absorb energy and the two outer compartments were liquid loaded in order to disrupt the gas bubble and slow fragments. The outer hull was intended to detonate a torpedo, with the outer two liquid compartments absorbing the shock and slowing any splinters or debris while the lower armored belt and the empty compartment behind it absorb any remaining energy. However, the Navy discovered in caisson tests in 1939 that the initial design for this torpedo defense system was actually less effective than the previous design used on the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s due to the rigidity of the lower armor belt causing the explosion to significantly displace the final holding bulkhead inwards despite remaining watertight. To mitigate the effects, the third deck and triple bottom structure behind the lower armor belt were reinforced and the placement of brackets was changed. &quot;Iowa&quot;s&#x27; system was also improved over the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s&#x27; through closer spacing of the transverse bulkheads, greater thickness of the lower belt at the triple bottom joint, and increased total volume of the &quot;bulge&quot;. The system was further modified for the last two ships of the class, &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot;, by eliminating knuckles along certain bulkheads; this was estimated to improve the strength of the system by as much as 20%.

Based on costly lessons in the Pacific theater, concerns were raised about the ability of the armor on these battleships to withstand aerial bombing, particularly high-altitude bombing using armor-piercing bombs. Developments such as the Norden bombsight further fueled these concerns. While the design of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s was too far along to adequately address this issue, experience in the Pacific theater eventually demonstrated that high-altitude unguided bombing was ineffective against maneuvering warships.

=== Aircraft (1943–69) ===
When they were commissioned during World War II, the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships came equipped with two aircraft catapults designed to launch floatplanes. Initially, the &quot;Iowa&quot;s carried the Vought OS2U Kingfisher and Curtiss SC Seahawk, both of which were employed to spot for the battleship&#x27;s main gun batteries – and, in a secondary capacity, perform search-and-rescue missions.

By the time of the Korean War, helicopters had replaced floatplanes and the Sikorsky HO3S-1 helicopter was employed. &quot;New Jersey&quot; made use of the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH drone for her Vietnam War deployment in 1968–69.

== Conversion proposals ==
The &quot;Iowa&quot; class were the only battleships with the speed required for post-war operations based around fast aircraft carrier task forces. There were several proposals in the early Cold War to convert the class to take into account changes in technology and doctrine. These included plans to equip the class with nuclear missiles, add aircraft capability, and – in the case of &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot; – a proposal to rebuild both as aircraft carriers instead of battleships.

Initially, the &quot;Iowa&quot; class was to consist of only four battleships with hull numbers BB-61 to BB-64: &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;New Jersey&quot;, &quot;Missouri&quot;, and &quot;Wisconsin&quot;. However, changing priorities during World War II resulted in the battleship hull numbers BB-65 and BB-66 being reordered as &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot;, respectively; &quot;Montana&quot; and &quot;Ohio&quot; were reassigned to hull numbers BB-67 and BB-68. At the time these two battleships were to be built a proposal was put forth to have them constructed as aircraft carriers rather than fast battleships. The plan called for the ships to be rebuilt to include a flight deck and an armament suite similar to that placed aboard the s that were at the time under construction in the United States. Ultimately, nothing came of the design proposal to rebuild these two ships as aircraft carriers and they were cleared for construction as fast battleships to conform to the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class design, though they differed from the earlier four that were built. Eventually, the light cruisers were selected for the aircraft-carrier conversion. Nine of these light cruisers would be rebuilt as light aircraft carriers.

After the surrender of the Empire of Japan, construction on &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot; stopped. &quot;Illinois&quot; was eventually scrapped, but &quot;Kentucky&quot;″s construction had advanced enough that several plans were proposed to complete &quot;Kentucky&quot; as a guided missile battleship (BBG) by removing the aft turret and installing a missile system. A similar conversion had already been performed on the battleship (BB-41/AG-128) to test the RIM-2 Terrier missile after World War II. One such proposal came from Rear Admiral W.K. Mendenhall, Chairman of the Ship Characteristics Board (SCB); Mendenhall proposed a plan that called for $15–30 million to be spent to allow &quot;Kentucky&quot; to be completed as a guided-missile battleship (BBG) carrying eight SSM-N-8 Regulus II guided missiles with a range of . He also suggested Terrier or RIM-8 Talos launchers to supplement the AA guns and proposed nuclear (instead of conventional) shells for the 16-inch guns. This never materialized, and &quot;Kentucky&quot; was ultimately sold for scrap in 1958, although her bow was used to repair her sister &quot;Wisconsin&quot; after a collision on 6 May 1956, earning her the nickname &quot;WisKy&quot;.

In 1954, the Long Range Objectives Group of the United States Navy suggested converting the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships to BBGs. In 1958, the Bureau of Ships offered a proposal based on this idea. This replaced the 5- and 16-inch gun batteries with &quot;two Talos twin missile systems, two RIM-24 Tartar twin missile systems, an RUR-5 ASROC antisubmarine missile launcher, and a Regulus II installation with four missiles&quot;, as well as flagship facilities, sonar, helicopters, and fire-control systems for the Talos and Tartar missiles. In addition to these upgrades, of additional fuel oil was also suggested to serve in part as ballast for the battleships and for use in refueling destroyers and cruisers. Due to the estimated cost of the overhaul ($178–193 million) this proposal was rejected as too expensive; instead, the SCB suggested a design with one Talos, one Tartar, one ASROC, and two Regulus launchers and changes to the superstructure, at a cost of up to $85 million. This design was later revised to accommodate the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile, which in turn resulted in a study of two schemes by the SCB. In the end, none of these proposed conversions for the battleships were ever authorized. Interest in converting the &quot;Iowa&quot;s into guided-missile battleships began to deteriorate in 1960 because the hulls were considered too old and the conversion costs too high. Nonetheless, additional conversion proposals – including one to install the AN/SPY-1 Aegis Combat System radar on the battleships – were suggested in 1962, 1974, and 1977, but as before, these proposals failed to gain the needed authorization. This was due, in part, to the possibility that sensitive electronics within of any 16-inch gun muzzle may be damaged from overpressure.

== 1980s reactivation/modernization ==
In 1980, Ronald Reagan was elected president on a promise to build up the US military as a response to the increasing military power of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Navy was commissioning the &quot;Kirov&quot; class of missile cruisers, the largest type of surface combatant since World War II. As part of Reagan&#x27;s 600-ship Navy policy and as a counter to the &quot;Kirov&quot; class, the US Navy began reactivating the four &quot;Iowa&quot;-class units and modernizing them for service.
The Navy considered several proposals that would have removed the aft 16-inch turret. Martin Marietta proposed to replace the turret with servicing facilities for 12 AV-8B Harrier STOVL jump jets. A more detailed proposal, the &quot;Interdiction Assault Ship&quot;, proposed a V-shaped ramped flight deck (the base of the V would have been on the ship&#x27;s stern, while each leg of the V would extend forward, so that planes taking off would fly past the ship&#x27;s exhaust stacks and conning tower), while a new hangar would be added with two elevators, which would support up to twelve McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II jump-jets. These aviation facilities could also support helicopters, SEAL teams and up to 500 Marines for an air assault. In the empty space between the V flight deck would be up to 320 missile silos accommodating a mixture of Tomahawk land attack missiles, ASROC anti-submarine rockets and Standard surface-to-air missiles. The existing five-inch gun turrets would be replaced with 155-millimeter howitzers for naval gunfire support.

Charles Myers, a former Navy test pilot turned Pentagon consultant, proposed replacing the turret with vertical launch systems for missiles and a flight deck for Marine helicopters. In July 1981, the US Naval Institute&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings&quot; published a proposal by naval architect Gene Anderson for a canted flight deck with steam catapult and arrestor wires for F/A-18 Hornet fighters. Plans for these conversions were dropped in 1984.

Each battleship was overhauled to burn navy distillate fuel and modernized to carry electronic warfare suites, close-in weapon systems (CIWS) for self-defense, and missiles. The obsolete electronics and anti-aircraft armament were removed to make room for more modern systems. The Navy spent about $1.7 billion, from 1981 through 1988, to modernize and reactivate the four &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships, roughly the same as building four &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates.

After modernization, the full load displacement was relatively unchanged at .

The modernized battleships operated as centerpieces of their own battle group (termed as a Battleship Battle Group or Surface Action Group), consisting of one , one or , one , three s and one support ship, such as a fleet oiler.

=== Armament ===

During their modernization in the 1980s, each &quot;Iowa&quot; was equipped with four of the US Navy&#x27;s Phalanx CIWS mounts, two of which sat just behind the bridge and two which were next to the ship&#x27;s aft funnel. &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;New Jersey&quot;, and &quot;Missouri&quot; were equipped with the Block 0 version of the Phalanx, while &quot;Wisconsin&quot; received the first operational Block 1 version in 1988. The Phalanx system is intended to serve as a last line of defense against enemy missiles and aircraft, and when activated can engage a target with a 20 mm M61 Vulcan 6-barreled Gatling cannon at a distance of approximately .

As part of their modernization in the 1980s, each of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s received a complement of eight quad-cell Armored Box Launchers and four &quot;shock hardened&quot; Mk 141 quad-cell launchers. The former was used by the battleships to carry and fire the BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) for use against enemy targets on land, while the latter system enabled the ships to carry a complement of RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles for use against enemy ships. With an estimated range of for the Tomahawks and for the Harpoons, these two missile systems displaced the 16-inch guns and their maximum range of to become the longest-ranged weapons on the battleships during the 1980s; the ships&#x27; complement of 32 Tomahawk missiles was the largest until the Mk 41 VLS-equipped cruisers entered service. It has been alleged by members of the environmental group Greenpeace that the battleships carried the TLAM-A (also cited, incorrectly, as the TLAM-N) – a Tomahawk missile with a variable yield W80 nuclear warhead – during their 1980s service with the United States Navy, but owing to the United States Navy&#x27;s policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships, these claims can not be conclusively proved. Between 2010 and 2013, the US withdrew the BGM-109A, leaving only conventional munitions packages for its Tomahawk missile inventory, though the Iowas had been withdrawn from service at that point.

Owing to the original 1938 design of the battleships, the Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the &quot;Iowa&quot; class unless the battleships were rebuilt in such a way as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the &quot;Iowa&quot;s and the removal of four of each of the battleships&#x27; ten 5-inch/38 DP mounts. The mid and aft end of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile launchers. At one point, the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects of firing the main battery. To supplement the anti-aircraft capabilities of the &quot;Iowa&quot;s, five FIM-92 Stinger surface-to-air missile firing positions were installed. These secured the shoulder-launched weapons and their rounds for ready use by the crew.

=== Electronics ===
During their modernization under the 600-ship Navy program, the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships&#x27; radar systems were again upgraded. The foremast was of a new tripod design that was considerably reinforced to allow the AN/SPS-6 air-search radar system to be replaced with the AN/SPS-49 radar set (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search radar set was replaced by the AN/SPS-67 search radar. The new mast also incorporates a Tactical Air Navigation System (TACAN) antenna. The aft mast was changed to be placed in front of the aft funnel and mounts a circular SATCOM antenna while another one was mounted on the fire control mast.

By the Korean War, jet engines had replaced propellers on aircraft, which severely limited the ability of the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. &quot;New Jersey&quot; received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx CIWS mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20 mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.

With the added missile capacity of the battleships in the 1980s came additional fire-support systems to launch and guide the ordnance. To fire the Harpoon anti-ship missiles, the battleships were equipped with the SWG-1 fire-control system, and to fire the Tomahawk missiles the battleships used either the SWG-2 or SWG-3 fire-control system. In addition to these offensive-weapon systems, the battleships were outfitted with the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie to be used as a lure against enemy torpedoes; an SLQ-32 electronic warfare system that can detect, jam, and deceive an opponent&#x27;s radar; and a Mark 36 SRBOC system to fire chaff rockets intended to confuse enemy missiles.

Aside from the electronics added for weaponry control, all four battleships were outfitted with a communications suite used by both cruisers and guided missile cruisers in service at the time. This communication suite included the OE-82 antenna for satellite communications but did not include the Naval Tactical Data System.

=== Aircraft (1982–1992) ===
During the 1980s these battleships made use of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an unmanned aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under the belly of the aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed at the back of the ship; the aircraft was flown into it. &quot;Missouri&quot; and &quot;Wisconsin&quot; both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by &quot;Wisconsin&quot; received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned &quot;Iowa&quot;s could support operations by various types of helicopters, including the UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion, and LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.

== Gunfire support role ==
Following the 1991 Gulf War and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States Navy began to decommission and mothball many of the ships it had brought out of its reserve fleet in the drive to attain a 600-ship Navy. At the height of Navy Secretary John F. Lehman&#x27;s 600-ship Navy plan, nearly 600 ships of all types were active within the Navy. This included fifteen aircraft carriers, four battleships, and over 100 submarines, along with various other types of ships the overall plan specified. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 the Navy sought to return to its traditional, 313-ship composition. While reducing the fleet created under the 600-ship Navy program, the decision was made to deactivate the four recommissioned &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships and return them to the reserve fleet.

In 1995, the decommissioned battleships were removed from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; after it was determined by ranking US Navy officials that there was no place for a battleship in the modern navy. In response to the striking of the battleships from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; a movement began to reinstate the battleships, on the grounds that these vessels had superior firepower over the 5-inch guns found on the &quot;Spruance&quot;, &quot;Kidd&quot; and &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers and &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class cruisers. Citing concern over the lack of available gunfire to support amphibious operations, Congress required the Navy to reinstate two battleships to the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; and maintain them with the mothball fleet, until the Navy could certify it had gunfire support within the current fleet that would meet or exceed the battleship&#x27;s capability.

The debate over battleships in the modern navy continued until 2006, when the two reinstated battleships were stricken after naval officials submitted a two-part plan that called for the near-term goal of increasing the range of the guns in use on the &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers with new Extended Range Guided Munition (ERGM) ammunition intended to allow a 5-inch projectile fired from these guns to travel an estimated inland. The long-term goal called for the replacement of the two battleships with 32 vessels of the of guided-missile destroyers. Cost overruns caused the class to be reduced to three ships. These ships are outfitted with an Advanced Gun System (AGS) that was to fire specially developed 6-inch Long Range Land Attack Projectiles for shore bombardment. LRLAP procurement was canceled in 2017 and the AGS is unusable. The long-term goal for the &quot;Zumwalt&quot; class is to have the ships mount railguns or free-electron lasers.

== Cultural significance ==


The &quot;Iowa&quot; class became culturally symbolic in the United States in many different ways, to the point where certain elements of the American public – such as the United States Naval Fire Support Association – were unwilling to part with the battleships, despite their apparent obsolescence in the face of modern naval combat doctrine that places great emphasis on air supremacy and missile firepower. Although all were officially stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; they were spared scrapping and were donated for use as museum ships.

Their service records added to their fame, ranging from their work as carrier escorts in World War II to their shore bombardment duties in North Korea, North Vietnam, and the Middle East, as well as their service in the Cold War against the expanded Soviet Navy. Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships&#x27; 16-inch guns were such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity – and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the &quot;Kirov&quot;-class battlecruisers – the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors pleading for a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.

In part because of the service length and record of the class, members have made numerous appearances in television shows, video games, movies, and other media, including appearances of the &quot;Kentucky&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot; in the anime series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, the History Channel documentary series &quot;Battle 360: USS Enterprise&quot;, the Discovery Channel documentary &quot;The Top 10 Fighting Ships&quot; (where the &quot;Iowa&quot; class was rated Number 1), the book turned movie &quot;A Glimpse of Hell&quot;, the 1989 music video for the song by Cher &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;, the 1992 film &quot;Under Siege&quot;, the 2012 film &quot;Battleship&quot;, among other appearances. Japanese rock band Vamps performed the finale of their 2009 US tour on board &quot;Missouri&quot; on 19 September 2009.

== Ships in class==

When brought into service during the final years of World War II, the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships were assigned to operate in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. By this point in the war, aircraft carriers had displaced battleships as the primary striking arm of both the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy. As a result of this shift in tactics, US fast battleships of all classes were relegated to the secondary role of carrier escorts and assigned to the Fast Carrier Task Force to provide anti-aircraft screening for Allied aircraft carriers and perform shore bombardment. Three were recalled to service in the 1950s with the outbreak of the Korean War, and they provided naval artillery support for U.N. forces for the entire duration of the war before being returned to mothballs in 1955 after hostilities ceased. In 1968, to help alleviate US air losses over North Vietnam, &quot;New Jersey&quot; was summoned to Vietnam, but she was decommissioned a year after arriving. All four returned in the 1980s during the drive for a 600-ship Navy to counter the new Soviet &quot;Kirov&quot;-class battlecruisers, only to be retired after the collapse of the Soviet Union on the grounds that they were too expensive to maintain.


=== &quot;Iowa&quot; ===

&quot;Iowa&quot; was ordered 1 July 1939, laid down 27 June 1940, launched 27 August 1942, and commissioned 22 February 1943. She conducted a shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay before sailing to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, to be ready in case the entered the Atlantic. Transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1944, &quot;Iowa&quot; made her combat debut in February and participated in the campaign for the Marshall Islands. The ship later escorted US aircraft carriers conducting air raids in the Marianas campaign, and then was present at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During the Korean War, &quot;Iowa&quot; bombarded enemy targets at Songjin, Hŭngnam and Kojo, North Korea. &quot;Iowa&quot; returned to the US for operational and training exercises before being decommissioned on 24 February 1958. Reactivated in the early 1980s, &quot;Iowa&quot; operated in the Atlantic Fleet, cruising in North American and European waters for most of the decade and participating in joint military exercises with European ships. On 19 April 1989, 47 sailors were killed following an explosion in her No. 2 turret. In 1990, &quot;Iowa&quot; was decommissioned for the last time and placed in the mothball fleet. She was stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 17 March 2006. &quot;Iowa&quot; was anchored as part of the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay, California until October 2011, when she was towed from her mooring to Richmond, California for renovation as a museum ship. She was towed from Richmond in the San Francisco Bay on 26 May 2012, to San Pedro at the Los Angeles Waterfront to serve as a museum ship run by Pacific Battleship Center and opened to the public on 7 July 2012.

=== &quot;New Jersey&quot; ===

&quot;New Jersey&quot; was ordered 4 July 1939, laid down 16 September 1940, launched 7 December 1942, and commissioned 23 May 1943. &quot;New Jersey&quot; completed fitting out and trained her initial crew in the Western Atlantic and Caribbean before transferring to the Pacific Theatre in advance of the planned assault on the Marshall Islands, where she screened the US fleet of aircraft carriers from enemy air raids. At the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the ship protected carriers with her anti-aircraft guns. &quot;New Jersey&quot; then bombarded Iwo Jima and Okinawa. During the Korean War, the ship pounded targets at Wonsan, Yangyang, and Kansong. Following the , &quot;New Jersey&quot; conducted training and operation cruises until she was decommissioned on 21 August 1957. Recalled to duty in 1968, &quot;New Jersey&quot; reported to the gunline off the Vietnamese coast and shelled North Vietnamese targets before departing the line in December 1968. She was decommissioned the following year. Reactivated in 1982 under the 600-ship Navy program, &quot;New Jersey&quot; was sent to Lebanon to protect US interests and US Marines, firing her main guns at Druze and Syrian positions in the Beqaa Valley east of Beirut. Decommissioned for the last time 8 February 1991, &quot;New Jersey&quot; was briefly retained on the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; before being donated to the Home Port Alliance of Camden, New Jersey for use as a museum ship in October 2001.

=== &quot;Missouri&quot; ===

&quot;Missouri&quot; was the last of the four &quot;Iowa&quot;s to be completed. She was ordered 12 June 1940, laid down 6 January 1941, launched 29 January 1944, and commissioned 11 June 1944. &quot;Missouri&quot; conducted her trials off New York with shakedown and battle practice in the Chesapeake Bay before transferring to the Pacific Fleet, where she screened US aircraft carriers involved in offensive operations against the Japanese before reporting to Okinawa to shell the island in advance of the planned landings. Following the bombardment of Okinawa, &quot;Missouri&quot; turned her attention to the Japanese homeland islands of Honshu and Hokkaido, performing shore bombardment and screening US carriers involved in combat operations. She became a symbol of the US Navy&#x27;s victory in the Pacific when representatives of the Empire of Japan boarded the battleship to sign the documents of unconditional surrender to the Allied powers in September 1945. After World War II, &quot;Missouri&quot; conducted largely uneventful training and operational cruises until suffering a grounding accident. In 1950, she was dispatched to Korea in response to the outbreak of the Korean War. &quot;Missouri&quot; served two tours of duty in Korea providing shore bombardment. She was decommissioned in 1956. She spent many years at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. Reactivated in 1984, as part of the 600-ship Navy plan, &quot;Missouri&quot; was sent on operational cruises until being assigned to Operation Earnest Will in 1988. In 1991, &quot;Missouri&quot; participated in Operation Desert Storm, firing 28 Tomahawk Missiles and 759 16-inch shells at Iraqi targets along the coast. Decommissioned for the last time in 1992, &quot;Missouri&quot; was donated to the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; Memorial Association of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for use as a museum ship in 1999.

=== &quot;Wisconsin&quot; ===

&quot;Wisconsin&quot; was ordered 12 June 1940, laid down 25 January 1942, launched 7 December 1943, and commissioned 16 April 1944. After trials and initial training in the Chesapeake Bay, she transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1944 and was assigned to protect the US fleet of aircraft carriers involved in operations in the Philippines until summoned to Iwo Jima to bombard the island in advance of the Marine landings. Afterward, she proceeded to Okinawa, bombarding the island in advance of the Allied amphibious assault. In mid-1945 &quot;Wisconsin&quot; turned her attention to bombarding the Japanese home islands until the surrender of Japan in August. Reactivated in 1950, for the Korean War, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; served two tours of duty, assisting South Korean and UN forces by providing call fire support and shelling targets. In 1956, the bow of the uncompleted &quot;Kentucky&quot; was removed and grafted on &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, which had collided with the destroyer . Decommissioned in 1958, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was placed in the reserve fleet at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard until reactivated in 1986 as part of the 600-ship Navy plan. In 1991, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; participated in Operation Desert Storm, firing 24 Tomahawk Missiles at Iraqi targets and expending 319 16-inch shells at Iraqi troop formations along the coast. Decommissioned for the last time 30 September 1991, &quot;Wisconsin&quot; was placed in the reserve fleet until stricken from the &quot;Naval Vessel Register&quot; on 17 March 2006, so she could be transferred for use as a museum ship. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; is currently berthed at the Nauticus maritime museum in Norfolk, Virginia.

=== &quot;Illinois&quot; and &quot;Kentucky&quot; ===

Hull numbers BB-65 and BB-66 were originally intended as the first and second ships of the &quot;Montana&quot;-class of battleships; however, the passage of an emergency war building program on 19 July 1940 resulted in both hulls being reordered as &quot;Iowa&quot;-class units to save time on construction. The war ended before either could be completed, and work was eventually stopped. Initially, proposals were made to convert the hulls into aircraft carriers similar to the &quot;Essex&quot; class, but the effort was dropped.

 was ordered on 9 September 1940 and initially laid down on 6 December 1942. However, work was suspended pending a decision on whether to convert the hull to an aircraft carrier. Upon determination the result would cost more and be less capable than building from scratch, construction resumed, but it was canceled for good approximately one-quarter complete on 11 August 1945. She was sold for scrap and broken up on the slipway in September 1958.
 was ordered on 9 September 1940 and laid down on 7 March 1942. Work on the ship was suspended in June 1942, and the hull floated out to make room for the construction of LSTs. The interruption lasted for two and a half years while a parallel aircraft carrier debate played out as with &quot;Illinois&quot;, reaching the same conclusion. Work resumed in December 1944, with completion projected for mid-1946. Further suggestions were made to convert &quot;Kentucky&quot; into a specialist anti-aircraft ship, and work was again suspended. With the hull approximately three-quarters completed, she was floated on 20 January 1950, to clear a dry dock for repairs to &quot;Missouri&quot;, which had run aground. During this period, plans were proposed to convert &quot;Kentucky&quot; into a guided missile battleship, which saw her reclassified from BB-66 to BBG-1. When these failed construction of any sort, work never resumed and the ship was used as a parts hulk; in 1956, her bow was removed and shipped in one piece across Hampton Roads and grafted onto &quot;Wisconsin&quot;, which had collided with the destroyer &quot;Eaton&quot;. In 1958, the engines installed on &quot;Kentucky&quot; were salvaged and installed on the &quot;Sacramento&quot;-class fast combat support ships and . Ultimately, what remained of the hulk was sold for scrap on 31 October 1958.

<text>Sophie Tucker (born Sofia Kalish; January 13, 1886 – February 9, 1966) was a Ukrainian-American singer, comedian, actress, and radio personality. Known for her powerful delivery of comical and risqué songs, she was one of the most popular entertainers in the U.S. during the first half of the 20th century. She was known by the nickname &quot;the Last of the Red-Hot Mamas&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Tucker was born Sofiya &quot;Sonya&quot; Kalish (Ukrainian: Соня Калиш; ) in 1886 to a Jewish family in Tulchyn, Russian Empire, now Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine. (Sonya is a pet name for Sofiya in Ukrainian as well as for Sofya, the Yiddish form of the name Sophia.) They arrived in Boston on September 26, 1887. The family adopted the surname Abuza before immigrating, her father fearing repercussions for having deserted from the Imperial Russian Army. The family lived in Boston&#x27;s North End for eight years, then settled in Hartford, Connecticut, and opened a restaurant.

At a young age, she began singing at her parents&#x27; restaurant for tips. Between taking orders and serving customers, Tucker recalled that she &quot;would stand up in the narrow space by the door and sing with all the drama I could put into it. At the end of the last chorus, between me and the onions, there wasn&#x27;t a dry eye in the place.&quot;

In 1903, around the age of 17, Tucker eloped with Louis Tuck, a beer cart driver, from whom she later derived her professional surname. When she returned home, her parents arranged an Orthodox wedding for the couple. In 1905, she gave birth to a son, Albert. However, shortly after Albert was born, the couple separated, and Tucker left the baby with her family and moved to New York City.

==Career==
After Tucker left her husband, Willie Howard gave her a letter of recommendation to Harold Von Tilzer, a composer and theatrical producer in New York. When it failed to bring her work, Tucker found jobs in cafés and beer gardens, singing for food and tips from the customers. She sent most of what she made back home to Connecticut to support her son and family.

===Stage===
In 1907, Tucker made her first theater appearance, singing at an amateur night in a vaudeville establishment. The producers thought that the crowd would tease her for being &quot;so big and ugly.&quot; Early in her career, Tucker appeared in blackface as a minstrel singer, but she disliked this work and would sabotage the act by revealing that she was white at the end of the show, first removing a glove to reveal her white hand, then by pulling off her wig and exposing her blonde hair. Tucker also began integrating &quot;fat girl&quot; humor, which became a common thread in her acts. Her songs included &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Get Thin&quot; and &quot;Nobody Loves a Fat Girl, But Oh How a Fat Girl Can Love.&quot;
In 1909, Tucker performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. Though she was a hit, the other female stars refused to share the spotlight with her, and the company was forced to let her go. This caught the attention of William Morris, a theater owner and future founder of the William Morris Agency. Two years later, Tucker released &quot;Some of These Days&quot; on Edison Records, written by Shelton Brooks. The title of the song was used as the title of Tucker&#x27;s 1945 biography.

In 1921, Tucker hired pianist and songwriter Ted Shapiro as her accompanist and musical director, a position he would keep throughout her career. Besides writing a number of songs for her, Shapiro became part of her stage act, playing piano on stage while she sang, and exchanging banter and wisecracks with her in between numbers. Tucker remained a popular singer through the 1920s and became friends with stars such as Mamie Smith and Ethel Waters, who introduced her to jazz. Tucker learned from these women and became one of the early performers to introduce jazz to white vaudeville audiences.

Also in 1921, Nathan Handwerker named his previously unnamed hot dog stand Nathan&#x27;s Hot Dogs in 1921 after Tucker, then a singer at the nearby Carey Walsh&#x27;s Cafe, made a hit of the song &quot;Nathan, Nathan, Why You Waitin?&quot; 

In 1925, Jack Yellen wrote &quot;My Yiddishe Momme&quot;, a song which became strongly identified with her and was performed in cities which had a significant Jewish audience. Tucker said &quot;Even though I loved the song and it was a sensational hit every time I sang it, I was always careful to use it only when I knew the majority of the house would understand Yiddish. However, you didn&#x27;t have to be a Jew to be moved by &#x27;My Yiddishe Momme&#x27;.&quot; The song was banned in Nazi Germany. 

===Popularity===

By the 1920s, Tucker&#x27;s success had spread to Europe, and she began a tour of England, performing for King George V and Queen Mary at the London Palladium in 1926. Tucker re-released her hit song &quot;Some of These Days&quot;, backed by Ted Lewis and his band, which stayed at the number 1 position of the charts for five weeks beginning November 23, 1926. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

Tucker was strongly affected by the decline of vaudeville. Speaking about performing in the final show at E.F. Albee&#x27;s Palace Theater in New York City, she remarked &quot;Everyone knew the theater was to be closed down, and a landmark in show business would be gone. That feeling got into the acts. The whole place, even the performers, stank of decay. I seemed to smell it. It challenged me. I was determined to give the audience the idea: Why brood over yesterday? We have tomorrow. As I sang, I could feel the atmosphere change. The gloom began to lift, the spirit which formerly filled the Palace and which made it famous among vaudeville houses the world over came back. That&#x27;s what an entertainer can do.&quot;
In 1929, she made her first movie appearance in &quot;Honky Tonk&quot;. During the 1930s, Tucker brought elements of nostalgia for the early years of the 20th century into her show. She was billed as &quot;the Last of the Red Hot Mamas&quot; as her hearty sexual appetite was a frequent subject of her songs, unusual for female performers of the day after the decline of vaudeville.

The cartoon &quot;The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos&quot; caricatures Tucker as Sophie Turkey.

===American Federation of Actors===
In 1938, Tucker was elected president of the American Federation of Actors, an early actors&#x27; trade union. Originally formed for vaudeville and circus performers, the union expanded to include nightclub performers and was chartered as a branch of the Associated Actors and Artistes.

In 1939, the union was disbanded by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) for financial mismanagement. However, Tucker was not implicated in the proceedings. The AFL later issued a charter for the succeeding American Guild of Variety Artists, which remains active.

===Later days===
In 1938–1939, Tucker had her own radio show, &quot;The Roi Tan Program with Sophie Tucker&quot;, broadcast on CBS for 15 minutes on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. She made numerous guest appearances on such programs as &quot;The Radio Hall of Fame&quot; and &quot;The Andrews Sisters&#x27; Show: Eight-to-the-Bar Ranch&quot; hosted by the Andrews Sisters. In the 1950s and early 1960s Tucker, &quot;the First Lady of Show Business&quot;, made frequent television appearances on many popular variety and talk shows of the day such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show &quot;and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. She remained popular abroad, performing for fanatical crowds in the music halls of London. On April 13, 1963, a Broadway musical titled &quot;Sophie&quot;, based on Tucker&#x27;s early life until 1922, opened with Libi Staiger as the lead. It closed after eight performances.

Tucker continued to perform for the rest of her life. In 1962, she performed in the Royal Variety Performance, which was broadcast on the BBC. She appeared on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on October 3, 1965. For the color broadcast, her last television appearance, she performed &quot;Give My Regards to Broadway&quot;, &quot;Louise&quot;, and her signature song, &quot;Some of These Days&quot;.

==Personal life==

Tucker was married three times. Her first marriage was to Louis Tuck, a beer cart driver, with whom she eloped in 1903. The marriage produced Tucker&#x27;s only child, Albert. In 1906 the couple separated, and Tucker left Albert with her family, supporting them with money from her singing jobs in New York. They were divorced in May 1913. Albert was raised by his maternal aunt, Annie. Annie and Sophie had a close relationship and kept in touch with weekly letters.

Her second marriage, to Frank Westphal (1917–20), her accompanist, and her third marriage, to Al Lackey (1928–34), her manager, both ended in divorce and produced no children. She blamed the failure of her marriages on her being too adjusted to economic independence. She said &quot;Once you start carrying your own suitcase, paying your own bills, running your own show, you&#x27;ve done something to yourself that makes you one of those women men like to call &#x27;a pal&#x27; and &#x27;a good sport,&#x27; the kind of woman they tell their troubles to. But you&#x27;ve cut yourself off from the orchids and the diamond bracelets except those you buy yourself.&quot;

Tucker died of lung cancer and kidney failure on February 9, 1966, aged 80, in her Park Avenue apartment. She continued working until her death, playing shows at the Latin Quarter just weeks before. Tucker is buried in Emanuel Cemetery in Wethersfield, Connecticut.

==Influences==
Tucker&#x27;s comic and singing styles are credited with influencing later female entertainers, including Mae West, Rusty Warren, Carol Channing, Totie Fields, Joan Rivers, Roseanne Barr, Ethel Merman, &quot;Mama&quot; Cass Elliot of the Mamas &amp; the Papas, and Bette Midler, who has included Tuck as one of her stage characters. She also influenced Miami-based radio and television host-cum-singer Peppy Fields, sister of noted pianist Irving Fields, whom &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; magazines called the &quot;Sophie Tucker of Miami&quot;.

Probably the greatest influence on Tucker&#x27;s later song delivery was Clarice Vance (1870–1961). They appeared many times on the same vaudeville bill. Sophie made her first recordings in 1910, and Clarice made her final records in 1909. Clarice had perfected and was known for her subtle narrative talk-singing style that Sophie later used to her advantage when her vocal range became increasingly limited. At the time that Clarice Vance was using the narrative style, it was unique to her among women entertainers.

==Legacy==
Tucker is briefly mentioned in the lyrics of the song &quot;Roxie&quot; from the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; (&quot;And Sophie Tucker&#x27;ll shit I know/To see her name get billed below/Foxy Roxie Hart&quot;) and was cited as the main influence for the character Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton.

A popular music revue, &quot;Sophie Tucker: The Last of the Red Hot Mamas&quot;, developed by Florida Studio Theatre (FST) in Sarasota, Florida, celebrates Tucker&#x27;s brassy and bawdy behavior, songs, and persona. Developed in-house by artistic director Richard Hopkins in 2000, it has enjoyed several productions across the country, including theatres in New York City, Chicago, Atlanta, and Toronto. Kathy Halenda, who originated the role of Tucker in the production, returned to FST for a limited engagement of &quot;The Last of the Red Hot Mamas&quot; in March 2012.

William Gazecki produced the 2014 documentary &quot;The Outrageous Sophie Tucker&quot;.

During the Beatles&#x27; appearance at the Royal Variety Performance on November 4, 1963, Paul McCartney introduced the song &quot;Till There Was You&quot; as having been recorded &quot;by our favourite American group, Sophie Tucker.&quot; McCartney likewise introduced the song &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; on the Ed Sullivan Show, February 16, 1964 in the same manner.

<text>A weather satellite or meteorological satellite is a type of Earth observation satellite that is primarily used to monitor the weather and climate of the Earth. Satellites are mainly of two types: polar orbiting (covering the entire Earth asynchronously) or geostationary (hovering over the same spot on the equator).

While primarily used to detect the development and movement of storm systems and other cloud patterns, meteorological satellites can also detect other phenomena such as city lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, and energy flows. Other types of environmental information are collected using weather satellites. Weather satellite images helped in monitoring the volcanic ash cloud from Mount St. Helens and activity from other volcanoes such as Mount Etna. Smoke from fires in the western United States such as Colorado and Utah have also been monitored.

El Niño and its effects on weather are monitored daily from satellite images. The Antarctic ozone hole is mapped from weather satellite data. Collectively, weather satellites flown by the U.S., Europe, India, China, Russia, and Japan provide nearly continuous observations for a global weather watch.

==History==

===1950s===
As early as 1946, the idea of cameras in orbit to observe the weather was being developed. This was due to sparse data observation coverage and the expense of using cloud cameras on rockets. By 1958, the early prototypes for TIROS and Vanguard (developed by the Army Signal Corps) were created. The first weather satellite, Vanguard 2, was launched on February 17, 1959. It was designed to measure cloud cover and resistance, but a poor axis of rotation and its elliptical orbit kept it from collecting a notable amount of useful data. The Explorer 6 and Explorer 7 satellites also contained weather-related experiments.

===1960s===
The first weather satellite to be considered a success was TIROS-1, launched by NASA on April 1, 1960. TIROS operated for 78 days and proved to be much more successful than Vanguard 2. Other early weather satellite programs include the 1962 Defense Satellite Applications Program (DSAP) and the 1964 Soviet Meteor series.

TIROS paved the way for the Nimbus program, whose technology and findings are the heritage of most of the Earth-observing satellites NASA and NOAA have launched since then. Beginning with the Nimbus 3 satellite in 1969, temperature information through the tropospheric column began to be retrieved by satellites from the eastern Atlantic and most of the Pacific Ocean, which led to significant improvements to weather forecasts.

The ESSA and NOAA polar orbiting satellites followed suit from the late 1960s onward. Geostationary satellites followed, beginning with the ATS and SMS series in the late 1960s and early 1970s, then continuing with the GOES series from the 1970s onward. Polar orbiting satellites such as QuikScat and TRMM began to relay wind information near the ocean&#x27;s surface starting in the late 1970s, with microwave imagery which resembled radar displays, which significantly improved the diagnoses of tropical cyclone strength, intensification, and location during the 2000s and 2010s.

===1970s===
In Europe, the first Meteosat geostationary operational meteorological satellite, Meteosat-1, was launched in 1977 on a Delta launch vehicle. The satellite was a spin-stabilised cylindrical design, 2.1 m in diameter and 3.2 m tall, rotating at approx. 100 rpm and carrying the Meteosat Visible and Infrared Imager (MVIRI) instrument. Successive Meteosat first generation satellites were launched, on European Ariane-4 launchers from Kourou in French Guyana, up to and including Meteosat-7 which acquired data from 1997 until 2017, operated initially by the European Space Agency and later by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). 

Japan has launched nine Himawari satellites beginning in 1977. 

===1980s===
Starting in 1988 China has launched twenty-one Fengyun satellites.

===2000s===
The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites - also spin stabilised although physically larger and twice the mass of the first generation - were developed by ESA with European industry and in cooperation with EUMETSAT who then operate the satellites from their headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany with this same approach followed for all subsequent European meteorological satellites. Meteosat-8, the first MSG satellite, was launched in 2002 on an Ariane-5 launcher, carrying the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) and Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instruments, along with payloads to support the COSPAS-SARSAT Search and Rescue (SAR) and ARGOS Data Collection Platform (DCP) missions. SEVIRI provided an increased number of spectral channels over MVIRI and imaged the full-Earth disc at double the rate. Meteosat-9 was launched to complement Meteosat-8 in 2005, with the second pair consisting of Meteosat-10 and Meteosat-11 launched in 2012 and 2015, respectively. 

In 2006, the first European low-Earth orbit operational meteorological satellite, Metop-A was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit at 817 km altitude by a Soyuz launcher from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. This operational satellite - which forms the space segment of the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) - built on the heritage from ESA&#x27;s ERS and Envisat experimental missions, and was followed at six-year intervals by Metop-B and Metop-C - the latter launched from French Guyana in a &quot;Europeanised&quot; Soyuz. Each carry thirteen different passive and active instruments ranging in design from imagers and sounders to a scatterometer and a radio-occultation instrument. The satellite service module is based on the SPOT-5 bus, while the payload suite is a combination of new and heritage instruments from both Europe and the US under the Initial Joint Polar System agreement between EUMETSAT and NOAA. 

===2010s===
The DSCOVR satellite, owned by NOAA, was launched in 2015 and became the first deep space satellite that can observe and predict space weather. It can detect potentially dangerous weather such as solar wind and geomagnetic storms. This is what has given humanity the capability to make accurate and preemptive space weather forecasts since the late 2010s.

===2020s===
The Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) programme launched its first satellite, Meteosat-12, in 2022, and featured a number of changes over its predecessors in support of its mission to gather data for weather forecasting and climate monitoring. The MTG satellites are three-axis stabilised rather than spin stabilised, giving greater flexibility in satellite and instrument design. The MTG system features separate Imager and Sounder satellite models that share the same satellite bus, with a baseline of three satellites - two Imagers and one Sounder - forming the operational configuration. The imager satellites carry the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI), succeeding MVIRI and SEVIRI to give even greater resolution and spectral coverage, scanning the full Earth disc every ten minutes, as well as a new Lightning Imager (LI) payload. The sounder satellites carry the Infrared Sounder (IRS) and Ultra-violet Visible Near-infrared (UVN) instruments. UVN is part of the European Commission&#x27;s Copernicus programme and fulfils the Sentinel-4 mission to monitor air quality, trace gases and aerosols over Europe hourly at high spatial resolution. Two MTG satellites - one Imager and one Sounder - will operate in close proximity from the 0-deg geostationary location over western Africa to observe the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Europe, Africa and the Middle East, while a second imager satellite will operate from 9.5-deg East to perform a Rapid Scanning mission over Europe. MTG continues Meteosat support to the ARGOS and Search and Rescue missions. MTG-I1 launched in one of the last Ariane-5 launches, with the subsequent satellites planned to launch in Ariane-6 when it enters service. 

A second generation of Metop satellites (MetOp-SG) is in advanced development with launch of the first satellite foreseen in 2025. As with MTG, Metop-SG will launch on Ariane-6 and comprise two satellite models to be operated in pairs in replacement of the single first generation satellites to continue the EPS mission.

==Observation==

Observation is typically made via different &#x27;channels&#x27; of the electromagnetic spectrum, in particular, the visible and infrared portions.

Some of these channels include:

*&quot;Visible and Near Infrared:&quot; 0.6–1.6 μmfor recording cloud cover during the day
*&quot;Infrared:&quot; 3.9–7.3 μm (water vapor), 8.7–13.4 μm (thermal imaging)

===Visible spectrum===
Visible-light images from weather satellites during local daylight hours are easy to interpret even by the average person, clouds, cloud systems such as fronts and tropical storms, lakes, forests, mountains, snow ice, fires, and pollution such as smoke, smog, dust and haze are readily apparent. Even wind can be determined by cloud patterns, alignments and movement from successive photos.

===Infrared spectrum===
The thermal or infrared images recorded by sensors called scanning radiometers enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. Infrared satellite imagery can be used effectively for tropical cyclones with a visible eye pattern, using the Dvorak technique, where the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops can be used to determine its intensity (colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm). Infrared pictures depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even El Niño phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.

==Types==
Each meteorological satellite is designed to use one of two different classes of orbit: geostationary and polar orbiting.

===Geostationary===
Geostationary weather satellites orbit the Earth above the equator at altitudes of 35,880 km (22,300 miles). Because of this orbit, they remain stationary with respect to the rotating Earth and thus can record or transmit images of the entire hemisphere below continuously with their visible-light and infrared sensors. The news media use the geostationary photos in their daily weather presentation as single images or made into movie loops. These are also available on the city forecast pages of www.noaa.gov (example Dallas, TX).

Several geostationary meteorological spacecraft are in operation. The United States&#x27; GOES series has three in operation: GOES-15, GOES-16 and GOES-17. GOES-16 and-17 remain stationary over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, respectively. GOES-15 was retired in early July 2019.

The satellite GOES 13 that was previously owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) was transferred to the U.S. Space Force in 2019 and renamed the EWS-G1; becoming the first geostationary weather satellite to be owned and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense.

Russia&#x27;s new-generation weather satellite Elektro-L No.1 operates at 76°E over the Indian Ocean. The Japanese have the MTSAT-2 located over the mid Pacific at 145°E and the Himawari 8 at 140°E. The Europeans have four in operation, Meteosat-8 (41.5°E) and Meteosat-9 (0°) over the Atlantic Ocean and have Meteosat-6 (63°E) and Meteosat-7 (57.5°E) over the Indian Ocean. China currently has four Fengyun (风云) geostationary satellites (FY-2E at 86.5°E, FY-2F at 123.5°E, FY-2G at 105°E and FY-4A at 104.5 °E) operated. India also operates geostationary satellites called INSAT which carry instruments for meteorological purposes.

===Polar orbiting===
Polar orbiting weather satellites circle the Earth at a typical altitude of 850 km (530 miles) in a north to south (or vice versa) path, passing over the poles in their continuous flight. Polar orbiting weather satellites are in sun-synchronous orbits, which means they are able to observe any place on Earth and will view every location twice each day with the same general lighting conditions due to the near-constant local solar time. Polar orbiting weather satellites offer a much better resolution than their geostationary counterparts due their closeness to the Earth.

The United States has the NOAA series of polar orbiting meteorological satellites, presently NOAA-15, NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 (POES) and NOAA-20 and NOAA-21 (JPSS). Europe has the Metop-A, Metop-B and Metop-C satellites operated by EUMETSAT. Russia has the Meteor and RESURS series of satellites. China has FY-3A, 3B and 3C. India has polar orbiting satellites as well.

====DMSP====

The United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Meteorological Satellite (DMSP) can &quot;see&quot; the best of all weather vehicles with its ability to detect objects almost as &#x27;small&#x27; as a huge oil tanker. In addition, of all the weather satellites in orbit, only DMSP can &quot;see&quot; at night in the visual. Some of the most spectacular photos have been recorded by the night visual sensor; city lights, volcanoes, fires, lightning, meteors, oil field burn-offs, as well as the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis have been captured by this high space vehicle&#x27;s low moonlight sensor.

At the same time, energy use and city growth can be monitored since both major and even minor cities, as well as highway lights, are conspicuous. This informs astronomers of light pollution. The New York City Blackout of 1977 was captured by one of the night orbiter DMSP space vehicles.

In addition to monitoring city lights, these photos are a life saving asset in the detection and monitoring of fires. Not only do the satellites see the fires visually day and night, but the thermal and infrared scanners on board these weather satellites detect potential fire sources below the surface of the Earth where smoldering occurs. Once the fire is detected, the same weather satellites provide vital information about wind that could fan or spread the fires. These same cloud photos from space tell the firefighter when it will rain.

Some of the most dramatic photos showed the 600 Kuwaiti oil fires that the fleeing Army of Iraq started on February 23, 1991. The night photos showed huge flashes, far outstripping the glow of large populated areas. The fires consumed huge quantities of oil; the last was doused on November 6, 1991.

==Uses==
Snowfield monitoring, especially in the Sierra Nevada, can be helpful to the hydrologist keeping track of available snowpack for runoff vital to the watersheds of the western United States. This information is gleaned from existing satellites of all agencies of the U.S. government (in addition to local, on-the-ground measurements). Ice floes, packs, and bergs can also be located and tracked from weather spacecraft.

Even pollution whether it is nature-made or human-made can be pinpointed. The visual and infrared photos show effects of pollution from their respective areas over the entire earth. Aircraft and rocket pollution, as well as condensation trails, can also be spotted. The ocean current and low level wind information gleaned from the space photos can help predict oceanic oil spill coverage and movement. Almost every summer, sand and dust from the Sahara Desert in Africa drifts across the equatorial regions of the Atlantic Ocean. GOES-EAST photos enable meteorologists to observe, track and forecast this sand cloud. In addition to reducing visibilities and causing respiratory problems, sand clouds suppress hurricane formation by modifying the solar radiation balance of the tropics. Other dust storms in Asia and mainland China are common and easy to spot and monitor, with recent examples of dust moving across the Pacific Ocean and reaching North America.

In remote areas of the world with few local observers, fires could rage out of control for days or even weeks and consume huge areas before authorities are alerted. Weather satellites can be a valuable asset in such situations. Nighttime photos also show the burn-off in gas and oil fields. Atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles have been taken by weather satellites since 1969.

==Non-imaging sensors==
Not all weather satellites are direct imagers. Some satellites are &quot;sounders&quot; that take measurements of a single pixel at a time. They have no horizontal spatial resolution but often are capable or resolving vertical atmospheric layers. Soundings along the satellite ground track can still be gridded later to form maps.

==International regulation==
According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a meteorological-satellite service (also: meteorological-satellite radiocommunication service) is – according to &quot;Article 1.52&quot; of the ITU Radio Regulations (RR) – defined as &quot;« An earth exploration-satellite service for meteorological purposes.» &quot;

<doc id="264730" wikidata="Q913639" url="?curid=264730" title="Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)">
<text>Stand Up, released in 1969, is the second studio album by British rock band Jethro Tull. It was the first Jethro Tull album to feature guitarist Martin Barre, who would go on to become the band&#x27;s longtime guitarist until its initial dissolution in 2011. Before recording sessions for the album began, the band&#x27;s original guitarist Mick Abrahams departed from the band as a result of musical differences with frontman and primary songwriter Ian Anderson; Abrahams wanted to stay with the blues rock sound of their 1968 debut, &quot;This Was&quot;, while Anderson wished to add other musical influences such as folk rock.

As a result of Abrahams&#x27; departure, Anderson was the sole songwriter on all of the album&#x27;s tracks, with the exception of the jazz fusion cover of J.S. Bach&#x27;s Bourrée in E minor. Anderson&#x27;s songwriting sees the album shift musically away from the blues rock of &quot;This Was&quot;, instead favoring more layered and poignant songs drawing influences from folk artists such as Roy Harper, Pentangle and Bert Jansch. However, the album does retain some blues rock influences on tracks such as side openers &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot; and &quot;Nothing Is Easy&quot;.

The album was released 25 July, and was No. 1 on the UK albums chart the following week, 3 August, following up on the success of the non-album single &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, which had reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart on the day the album was released. The album was Jethro Tull&#x27;s first success in the United States, reaching No. 20 on the Billboard 200. 

==Background==
Jethro Tull released their debut album &quot;This Was&quot; in October 1968. During the recording of &quot;This Was&quot;, frontman Ian Anderson began writing new material which differed from the straight blues/jazz fusion style which the band were known for at the time. Anderson estimated that he wrote &quot;50 percent&quot; of &quot;Stand Up&quot; during the summer of 1968. Anderson wrote the album&#x27;s songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedsit in Kentish Town, London, and cited Roy Harper, Ornette Coleman, Charlie Parker, Bert Jansch, Pentangle, Blind Faith and Jimi Hendrix as inspirations. The new material&#x27;s departure from the band&#x27;s blues-based style caused conflict with guitarist Mick Abrahams, who was a blues purist: Anderson recalled &quot;running some of [the new songs] by Mick Abrahams, and coming to the conclusion that they weren&#x27;t going up to be up his street at all&quot; while drummer Clive Bunker stated that &quot;when Ian started to write new and different stuff, that&#x27;s when we realised we were going to have serious problems, because Mick just didn&#x27;t want to do it.&quot; The stylistic clash resulted in Abrahams&#x27; departure from the band in December 1968. The band initially began rehearsals for &quot;Stand Up&quot; with Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, however Iommi left the band after only a few weeks as he felt he did not fit in well with the group. The job eventually went to Martin Barre, who immediately joined rehearsals for &quot;Stand Up&quot; before making his live debut with the band on 30 December 1968.

The band then embarked on a short Swedish tour to support Jimi Hendrix in January 1969 before embarking on a three-month U.S. tour (the band&#x27;s first) during which the band recorded the non-album single &quot;Living in the Past&quot; and B-side &quot;Driving Song&quot; at the behest of manager Terry Ellis to &quot;keep the pot boiling&quot; in the UK. Following the end of the tour in April, the band returned to the UK to begin recording sessions for the new album.

==Recording==
The album&#x27;s sessions began on 17 April 1969 with the recording of &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot;, and ended on 21 May 1969 when the band finished &quot;Look Into the Sun&quot;. There was a brief pause in early-mid May for the band to embark on a joint headlining tour of the UK and France with Ten Years After. All of the songs were recorded at Studio 2 of Morgan Studios, except for &quot;Bourée&quot; which was recorded at Olympic Studios because Morgan was already booked for the day (although takes of the song were also recorded at Morgan). The general routine was that the band would arrive at the studio at 9:00 am to work on one or two songs which would be finished by 4:00 or 5:00 pm. Anderson cited Morgan Studios&#x27; modern 8-track recording facilities as &quot;a big help&quot;, saying that &quot;8-track was the beginning of that creative freedom without which it would have been much harder to have made the &quot;Stand Up&quot; album.&quot; The band praised recording engineer Andy Johns, who they found easy to work with. Johns tried some innovative recording techniques on the album; for example on &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot; he achieved a swirling, stereo-shifting guitar effect by swinging an expensive Neumann U67 microphone on its cable in wide circles around the studio.

The majority of the album was recorded live with the entire band, with minimal overdubs, however primarily acoustic songs such as &quot;Look Into the Sun&quot; and &quot;Fat Man&quot; were recorded mostly solo by Anderson. The song &quot;Bourée&quot; proved the most difficult to record, with the band unsatisfied with any of the takes they recorded. The final version of the song was compiled later from several takes, with additional overdubs added by Anderson. Bass guitar on &quot;Look Into the Sun&quot; was recorded by Johns, as bassist Glenn Cornick was not present at the session (Johns&#x27; performance was uncredited on the album). One song titled &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; had its backing track recorded but was aborted during the sessions and was never released. The band also recorded the backing track for &quot;Play in Time&quot; during the sessions, a song which would later be finished and released on the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Benefit&quot;.

==Album cover==
The design of the album cover started with a visit to New Haven, Connecticut during a concert tour in late February 1969. Under the direction of producer Terry Ellis, the band met a woodcarver named James Grashow who followed them for a week in order to properly represent them in wood. The resulting gatefold album cover, in a woodcut style designed by Grashow, originally opened up like a children&#x27;s pop-up book so that a cut-out of the band&#x27;s personnel stood up, evoking the album&#x27;s title. &quot;Stand Up&quot; won &quot;New Musical Express&quot;&#x27;s award for best album artwork in 1969. The pop-up was not carried over to the 1973 album reissue, but is now available on the 180g vinyl issue of the Steven Wilson remixed version of the album, released in 2017.

==Musical style==
The album still shows a great blues influence, as in the first track &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot;. Some songs on the album exhibit unusual instrumentation, such as &quot;Fat Man,&quot; played on a mandolin, and &quot;Jeffery Goes to Leicester Square,&quot; played on a balalaika. The acoustic pieces, like &quot;Reasons for Waiting&quot;, already show Anderson under the influence of Roy Harper. The instrumental &quot;Bourée&quot; (one of Jethro Tull&#x27;s popular concert pieces) is a jazzy re-working of &quot;Bourrée in E minor&quot; by Johann Sebastian Bach. On the other hand, &quot;Nothing Is Easy&quot; is a jazz-rock song with drums and electric guitar that contrasts with the acoustic material on the album.

Ian Anderson has speculated that the chord progression in &quot;We Used to Know&quot; was picked up subconsciously by the Eagles when they toured together in 1971 or 1972 and used in their song &quot;Hotel California&quot;. However Don Felder, who wrote the music for &quot;Hotel California&quot;, did not join the Eagles until 1974. In a 2016 interview, Anderson stated that the chord progression had likely been used in earlier songs and also called &quot;Hotel California&quot; a &quot;much better song&quot; than &quot;We Used to Know&quot;.

==Themes==
Anderson has described the album&#x27;s lyrics as composing of a mixture of made up scenarios, occasionally mixed with biographical anecdotes or experiences from his personal life. Songs like &quot;Back to the Family&quot; and &quot;For a Thousand Mothers&quot; were influenced by Anderson&#x27;s rocky relationship with his parents at the time, while &quot;We Used to Know&quot; describes the band&#x27;s difficult life of financial hardship before finding success. Anderson has denied that songs concerning relationships such as &quot;A New Day Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Look Into the Sun&quot; and &quot;Reasons for Waiting&quot; were inspired by real life experiences, saying that &quot;I&#x27;ve always had a feeling that you don&#x27;t talk about real stuff when it comes to that, and that you shouldn&#x27;t betray real relationships in songs.&quot; Anderson wrote &quot;Fat Man&quot; as a reference to former guitarist Mick Abrahams (who was the largest member of the group), however Anderson has denied that the song was intended as an insult. &quot;Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square&quot; references Anderson&#x27;s friend Jeffrey Hammond, who was also referenced on &quot;This Was&quot; and would later join Jethro Tull as bassist in 1970.

==Critical reception and legacy==

&quot;Stand Up&quot; received mixed reviews upon its release, but more recent evaluations praised the album as a whole, for the production and musicianship.

The 1969 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review was quite positive, stating that the album &quot;has a fairly low raunch quotient, true to form, but it is quite marvellous&quot; and also that &quot;the album is not really funky; rather, it is a meticulously crafted work (no sterility implied) which deserves careful listening. At a time when many of the established stars are faltering, it is a particular pleasure to hear an important new voice.&quot; The contemporary &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; review was less favourable; it considered the expensive cover the &quot;most impressive&quot; part of the album and Jethro Tull a good live band but still incapable of producing a &quot;musically interesting&quot; release. American critic Robert Christgau reiterated his dislike of the band, but judged the album &quot;adequate&quot; in his &quot;Village Voice&quot; review.

A retrospective AllMusic review was positive, saying that the band had &quot;solidified their sound&quot; with the album, bringing an &quot;English folk music&quot; influence to several of the songs, atop an overall blues rock foundation. Sean Murphy of &quot;PopMatters&quot; more emphatically wrote that &quot;Stand Up&quot; was a &quot;meaningful document from what turned out to be a very transitional moment in rock history... a document created in a rapidly closing artistic window, pre-prog but post-British blues and psychedelic rock.&quot; He praised the musicianship of the players and remarked the first examples of &quot;the first-rate lyricist Anderson would quickly become.&quot; The &quot;Record Collector&quot; review highlights how &quot;the album captured the band on a vertiginous upswing, jubilant with confidence following the drafting in of guitarist Martin Barre&quot; and contained &quot;a fresh batch of diverse but uniformly strong compositions&quot;.

A variety of rock artists have cited &quot;Stand Up&quot; as an all-time favourite album, including Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder, Aerosmith&#x27;s Tom Hamilton, Joe Bonamassa, and Joe Satriani. Black Francis of Pixies also spoke glowingly of the album, commenting, &quot;&quot;Stand Up&quot; is the [Jethro Tull] record that moves me the most. It&#x27;s only their second album and they&#x27;re still kind of scruffy. There&#x27;s a heavy rock influence but they had that English thing going on, you know, university dudes who were really into folk music. It didn&#x27;t seem like an affectation to me – it still seems real&quot;. During an interview with &quot;BraveWords&quot; in 2015, Anderson selected &quot;Stand Up&quot; as his favourite Tull album: &quot;I suppose if you were to really twist my arm, I would probably go back to 1969, with the &quot;Stand Up&quot; album, because that was my first album of first really original music. It has a special place in my heart.&quot; Barre and Bunker have also ranked it as being among their favorite Tull albums. It was voted number 513 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).

<doc id="264734" wikidata="Q1327614" url="?curid=264734" title="Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei">
<text>Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei ((北)魏孝文帝) (October 13, 467 – April 26, 499), personal name Tuoba Hong (拓拔宏), later Yuan Hong (元宏), was an emperor of China&#x27;s Northern Wei dynasty, reigning from September 20, 471 to April 26, 499.

Under the regent of Empress Dowager Feng, Emperor Xiaowen enacted a new land-tenure system named the equal-field system in 485, which was aimed at boosting agricultural production and tax receipts. The implementation of the equal-field system was largely due to the court&#x27;s desire to break the economic power of local magnates who sheltered residents under their control living in fortified villages. Under this system, all land was owned by the state, and then equally distributed to taxpaying farmers. This system successfully created a stable fiscal infrastructure and a basis for universal military conscription for the Northern Wei, and continued well into the Tang dynasty. The equal-field program was coupled with another initiative, the &quot;Three Elders&quot; system, aimed at compiling accurate population registers so that land could be distributed accordingly.

Emperor Xiaowen implemented a policy of sinicization, intending to centralize the government and make the multi-ethnic state easier to govern. These policies included changing artistic styles to reflect Chinese preferences and forcing court officials to speak the language and to wear Chinese clothes. He compelled his own Xianbei people and others to adopt Chinese surnames, and changed his own family surname from Tuoba to Yuan. He also encouraged intermarriage between Xianbei and Han.

In 494, Emperor Xiaowen moved the Northern Wei capital from Pingcheng (平城, in modern Datong, Shanxi) to Luoyang, a city long acknowledged as a major center in Chinese history. While the capital was moved to Luoyang, the military elite remained centered at the old capital, widening the differences between the administration and the military. The population at the old capital remained conservative, while the population at Luoyang were much more eager to adopt Xiaowen&#x27;s policies of sinicization. His reforms were met with resistance by the Xianbei elite. In 496, two plots by Xianbei nobles, one centered on his crown prince Yuan Xun, and one centered on his distant uncle Yuan Yi (元頤). By 497, Xiaowen had destroyed the conspiracies and forced Yuan Xun to commit suicide.

== Early life and regency of Emperor Xianwen ==
Tuoba Hong was born in 467, when his father Emperor Xianwen was himself young—at the age of 13, and not yet ruling by himself, but instead was emperor under the regency of Emperor Xianwen&#x27;s stepmother Empress Dowager Feng. Tuoba Hong was Emperor Xianwen&#x27;s oldest son. His mother, Consort Li, was the daughter of Li Hui, a mid-level official at the time, who was a brother of Emperor Xianwen&#x27;s mother. Empress Dowager Feng, following Tuoba Hong&#x27;s birth, ended her regency and returned power to Emperor Xianwen, while spending her time raising Tuoba Hong. In 469, at age two, Tuoba Hong was created crown prince. That same year, his mother Consort Li died—and while traditional histories did not describe how she died, it appeared likely that she was forced to commit suicide according to the Northern Wei tradition of forcing crown princes&#x27; mothers to commit suicide, for it was written that the entire palace mourned her bitterly.

In 471, Emperor Xianwen, who favored Taoist and Buddhist philosophies, tired of the throne, and considered passing the throne to his uncle Tuoba Zitui (拓拔子推) the Prince of Jingzhao. After opposition by virtually all high level officials, however, Emperor Xianwen was still resolved to pass the throne to someone else, but decided to instead yield the throne to Crown Prince Hong. He subsequently did so, and Crown Prince Hong took the throne as Emperor Xiaowen, while Emperor Xianwen took the title of &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (retired emperor), although, due to Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s young age, Emperor Xianwen continued to be in actual control of important matters. When needed on the frontlines against Rouran, he conducted military campaigns himself, while leaving important officials in charge of the capital Pingcheng (平城, in modern Datong, Shanxi) with Emperor Xiaowen.

In 476, Empress Dowager Feng, resentful that Emperor Xianwen had put her lover Li Yi (李奕) to death in 470, had him assassinated. (Most historians, including Sima Guang, believed that she poisoned him, but another version indicated that Empress Dowager Feng readied assassins who, when Emperor Xianwen came to her palace to greet her, seized and smothered him.) She assumed regency over Emperor Xiaowen and assumed the title of Grand Empress Dowager.

== Regency of Grand Empress Dowager Feng ==

After Grand Empress Dowager Feng re-assumed regency, she was said to be more dictatorial than she was before, but intelligent in her decisions and frugal in her living. Not only was she highly literate, but she also was capable in mathematics. However, she trusted several eunuchs and permitted them to interfere in governmental matters. Further, she greatly promoted her lovers Wang Rui (王叡) and Li Chong (李沖) – both of whom were apparently talented officials, but whose promotions were beyond what their talents and contributions called for. She balanced her reputation by also promoting some honored officials who were not her lovers. Because she was concerned that she would be criticized for what was seen as immoral conduct, she punished those whom she perceived to be criticizing her or parodying her behavior with severe punishment, including death. One of her victims was Li Xin, who had contributed to her prior lover Li Yi&#x27;s death, as she had Li Xin put to death in 477. Fearful that Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s mother&#x27;s clan would try to take power, she falsely accused his grandfather Li Hui (李惠) the Prince of Nan Commandery of treason in 478 and had him and his clan slaughtered. She apparently accelerated the policy of Sinicization, which included social stratification, as she issued an edict in 478 requiring people to marry in their social classes.

The Northern Wei started to arrange for Han Chinese elites to marry daughters of the Xianbei Tuoba royal family in the 480s. Some Han Chinese exiled royalty fled from southern China and defected to the Xianbei. Several daughters of the Xianbei Emperor Xiaowen were married to Han Chinese elites, the Han Chinese Liu Song royal Liu Hui 刘辉, married Princess Lanling 蘭陵公主 of the Northern Wei, Princess Huayang 華陽公主 to Sima Fei 司馬朏, a descendant of Jin dynasty (266–420) royalty, Princess Jinan 濟南公主 to Lu Daoqian 盧道虔, Princess Nanyang 南阳长公主 to Xiao Baoyin 萧宝夤, a member of Southern Qi royalty. Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei&#x27;s sister the Shouyang Princess was wedded to The Liang dynasty ruler Emperor Wu of Liang&#x27;s son Xiao Zong .
In 479, after rival Liu Song&#x27;s throne was usurped by the general Xiao Daocheng, who established Southern Qi as its Emperor Gao, Northern Wei commissioned Liu Chang (劉昶) the Prince of Danyang, a Liu Song prince who had fled to Northern Wei in 465, with an army and promising him support to rebuild Liu Song. However, Liu Chang&#x27;s abilities were not up to task, and he was never able to gain much following in the border regions to mount a major drive to reestablish Liu Song. By 481, the campaign had fizzled.

Also in 481, the Buddhist monk Faxiu (法秀) tried to start a popular uprising at Pingcheng, but was discovered, captured, and executed. Some officials advocating the execution of all Buddhist monks, but Grand Empress Dowager Feng refused. Also that year, she started the building of her future tomb at Fang Mountain (方山), near Pingcheng, leaving instructions that after she died that it would be unnecessary for her to be buried with her husband Emperor Wengcheng, who was buried near the old Northern Wei capital Shengle (盛樂, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Later that year, a new criminal code that she commissioned Gao Lü to write was completed—with 832 sections, 16 of them prescribing clan-slaughter as penalty, 235 of them prescribing personal death penalty, and 377 prescribing other forms of punishment.

Sometime during Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s rise to power, Grand Empress Dowager Feng had him detained and considered deposing him in favor of his brother Tuoba Xi (拓拔禧), but her attendants persuaded her otherwise. While Grand Empress Dowager Feng never formally returned imperial powers to him, by about 483 he appeared to be fairly in control of the government, although Grand Empress Dowager Feng continued to retain substantial powers. Indeed, it was by her order that that year, after Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s concubine Consort Lin bore his oldest son, Tuoba Xun, Consort Lin was forced to commit suicide pursuant to Northern Wei customs. She raised Tuoba Xun herself. In 485, after Emperor Xiaowen created his younger brothers princes, Grand Empress Dowager Feng established an imperial school for these princes. In 486, perhaps as both a sign of Sinicization and demonstration of Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s authority, he began to assume traditional Chinese imperial clothing, including a robe with dragon patterns and a tasseled hat. As Emperor Xiaowen was raised by Grand Empress Dowager Feng, he also became very close to the family of her brother Feng Xi (馮熙). For some time, he took two of his daughters as concubines, but one of them soon died of illness, and the other, Consort Feng Run, also suffered a major illness and was sent back to her father house, where she became a Buddhist nun.

The power-sharing arrangement between stepgrandmother and stepgrandson could perhaps be illustrated by an incident in 489, when Emperor Wencheng&#x27;s younger brothers Tuoba Tianci (拓拔天賜) the Prince of Ruyin and Tuoba Zhen (拓拔楨) the Prince of Nan&#x27;an were accused of corruption, a death offense. Grand Empress Dowager Feng and Emperor Xiaowen jointly convened an imperial council to discuss their punishment. Grand Empress Dowager Feng opened by asking the officials, &quot;Do you believe that we should care about familial relations and destroy law, or to disregard familial relations and follow the law?&quot; The officials largely pleaded for the princes&#x27; lives. After Grand Empress Dowager Feng fell silent, Emperor Xiaowen stated: &quot;What the two princes committed is unpardonable, but the Grand Empress Dowager takes after the brotherly love that Gaozong [Emperor Wengcheng&#x27;s Temple name] had. Further, the Prince of Nan&#x27;an is filially pious toward his mother. Therefore, the two will be spared the death penalty, but their offices and titles will be stripped from them, and they will be reduced to commoner status with no political rights.&quot;

In 490, Grand Empress Dowager Feng died, and she was buried with magnificent honors. Emperor Xiaowen was so distraught that he was unable to take in food or water for five days, and subsequently observed a three-year mourning period for her, notwithstanding officials&#x27; pleas for him to shorten the mourning period in accordance with rules that Emperor Wen of Han had set.

== Early personal reign ==
After Grand Empress Dowager Feng&#x27;s death, Emperor Xiaowen not only continued the sinicization campaign, but carried it out in earnest, changing many laws and customs of the Northern Wei states to conform with Han, particularly Confucian, customs. While he sought out his mother Consort Li&#x27;s cousins (Consort Li&#x27;s brothers had been executed with their father Li Hui) and rewarded them with relatively low offices, he later retracted the rewards, bringing criticism that he was treating the Fengs with too much kindness and not treating the Lis with sufficient kindness.

in 492, in conformance with past dynasties&#x27; tradition, Emperor Xiaowen demoted the many princes in the state, unless they were descendants of the dynasty founder Emperor Daowu, to the titles of duke, with two exceptions: Baba Guan (拔拔觀) the Prince of Shangdang, because of the great accomplishments of his grandfather Baba Daosheng (拔拔道生), was allowed to remain prince; and the former Liu Song prince Liu Chang the Prince of Danyang, while having his own rank reduced to Duke of Qi Commandery, was given a special title, which appeared to be non-inheritable, of Prince of Song.

In 493, Emperor Xiaowen married another daughter of Feng Xi, Feng Qing, as empress.

Also in 493, Emperor Xiaowen began the first of a number of campaigns that he would conduct against Southern Qi – although in the case of this campaign, it was intended to instead allow him to move the capital from Pingcheng south to the Han heartland of Luoyang, to further his sinicization campaign. As he reached Luoyang in the late fall, he ordered a continued advance despite heavy rains, and then, when the Xianbei officials who opposed the campaign tried again to stop him, he offered a compromise—that the capital be moved to Luoyang, and the campaign be abandoned. The officials agreed. He also entrusted the matters of changing Xianbei ceremonies and music to Han ceremonies to the official Wang Su (王肅), who had only recently defected from Southern Qi.

in 494, Emperor Xiaowen made a return to Pingcheng, and, for reasons that are not clear, reopened the discussions on whether to move the capital to Luoyang. This time, the Xianbei officials largely opposed the move, but Emperor Xiaowen overruled them and continued moving the governmental agencies to Luoyang, although maintaining a fairly substantial governmental presence at Pingcheng for it to serve as the secondary capital. To alleviate the concerns that the move from Pingcheng to Luoyang would cause a supply shortage of horses and other livestock, he had the general Yuwen Fu (宇文福) set up a large livestock grazing zone at Heyang (河陽, in modern Jiaozuo and Xinxiang, Henan).

A fief of 100 households and the rank of 崇聖侯 &quot;Marquis who worships the sage&quot; was bestowed upon a Confucius descendant, Yan Hui&#x27;s lineage had 2 of its scions and Confucius&#x27;s lineage had 4 of its scions who had ranks bestowed on them in Shandong in 495 and a fief of ten households and rank of 崇聖大夫 &quot;Grandee who venerates the sage&quot; was bestowed on 孔乘 Kong Sheng who was Confucius&#x27;s scion in the 28th generation in 472 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei.

== Late personal reign ==
Late in 494, under the stated reason that Southern Qi&#x27;s Emperor Ming had usurped the throne (from his grandnephew Xiao Zhaowen), Emperor Xiaowen prepared a major campaign against Southern Qi, departing Luoyang about new year 495. He initially put the important cities Shouyang (壽陽, in modern Lu&#x27;an, Anhui) and Yiyang (義陽, in modern Xinyang, Henan) under siege, but could not capture them easily, and battles that his armies conducted against Southern Qi armies were largely indecisive. By late spring 495, he abandoned the campaign.

In summer 495, Emperor Xiaowen issued a number of edicts that made what was stated policy official law—that Xianbei clothing and language be prohibited, and that the Han clothing and language be used instead. (An exemption was given to those over 30.) In spring 496, he also ordered that the Xianbei family names be changed to Han ones, changing his own clan&#x27;s name from Tuoba to Yuan. He also strengthened the social stratification that had already been underway for some time, making eight Xianbei clans and five Han clans particularly honored, and ordering that all political offices be given by clan status, not by abilities, despite heavy opposition by his official Li Chong. The particularly honored clans were:

* Xianbei
** Mu (穆, originally Qiumuling)
** Lu (陸, originally Buliugu)
** He (賀, originally Helai)
** Liu (劉, originally Dugu)
** Lou (樓, originally Helou)
** Yu (于, originally Wuniuyu)
** Xi (奚, originally Daxi)
** Yu (尉, originally Yuchi)
* Han
** Lu (盧)
** Cui (崔)
** Zheng (鄭)
** Wang (王)
** Li (李)

Emperor Xiaowen went as far as ordering his six younger brothers to demote their current wives to concubine status, and taking the daughters of officials from the five Han clans to be their new wives, an action heavily criticized by historians.

Sometime prior to fall 496, Emperor Xiaowen had, perhaps due to recommendation from Empress Feng, welcomed her older sister Feng Run back to the palace to again be his concubine, and Feng Run, believing herself to be the older sister, refused to yield to Empress Feng and began to find ways to undermine her position. In summer 496, Emperor Xiaowen deposed Empress Feng, who then went to Yaoguang Temple (瑤光寺) and became a Buddhist nun.

Also in fall 496, the crown prince Yuan Xun, who did not adjust well to Han customs or the much hotter weather in Luoyang, plotted with his followers to flee back to Pingcheng, perhaps to hold that city against his father. His plot, however, was discovered, and Emperor Xiaowen, after asking his brother Yuan Xi (元禧) the Prince of Xianyang to cane Yuan Xun with him, deposed Yuan Xun. However, a second plot quickly arose, organized by the officials Mu Tai (穆泰) and Lu Rui (陸叡), who intended to again hold the northern regions against the Emperor. However, their plot was revealed by Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s distant uncle Yu Yi (元頤) the Prince of Yangping, whom they had intended to make their leader but who had only pretended to go along with their plot. Emperor Xiaowen sent a force commanded by his cousin Yuan Cheng (元澄) the Prince of Rencheng to Pingcheng, putting down the plot before it started in earnest, and putting Mu and Lu to death.

In spring 497, Emperor Xiaowen created another son, Yuan Ke, crown prince. Believing in reports by the official Li Biao (李彪), who then had the former Crown Prince Xun under house arrest, that Yuan Xun was still plotting rebellion, he forced Yuan Xun to commit suicide. In fall 497, Emperor Xiaowen created Feng Run to be empress, and when Yuan Ke&#x27;s mother Consort Gao subsequently died, common belief was that Empress Feng had her secretly poisoned so that she could raise Yuan Ke herself.

Also in fall 497, Emperor Xiaowen launched another major attack against Southern Qi, this time first concentrating on the city Wancheng (宛城, in modern Nanyang, Henan). While he was able to capture Wancheng and Xinye (新野, also in modern Nanyang), the battles were still largely indecisive. During his absence, a major conflict erupted between Li Chong and Li Biao in the capital Luoyang, and Li Chong, after putting Li Biao under arrest, died in anger. Partly because of this and partly because, once Southern Qi&#x27;s Emperor Ming died in fall 498, that he should not continue to attack a country that was mourning for its emperor, he ended the campaign in fall 498. At that same time, he himself was falling ill, and he entrusted the important matters to his brother Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng, although he subsequently recovered and was able to return to Luoyang.

Meanwhile, however, in Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s absence, Empress Feng had been carrying on an affair with the attendant Gao Pusa (高菩薩). When she, also in Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s absence, tried to force Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s sister Princess Pengcheng, whose husband Liu Chengxu (劉承緒, Liu Chang&#x27;s son) had died earlier, to marry her brother Feng Su (馮夙) the Duke of Beiping, Princess Pengcheng fled out of Luoyang and arrived at Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s camp, accusing Empress Feng of adultery. Once Emperor Xiaowen arrived back in Luoyang, he arrested Gao and Empress Feng&#x27;s assistant Shuang Meng (雙蒙) and interrogated them. He then interrogated Empress Feng personally as well, concluding that she had in fact committed adultery. However, claiming that he did not want to shame the Feng clan, he did not depose her, but refused to see her again and also ordered Crown Prince Ke to not to see her again either.

Emperor Xiaowen, despite his own weakened physical state, then decided to again advance south to react against a retaliation campaign by the Southern Qi general Chen Xianda (陳顯達). He was able to repel and defeat Chen, but while on the campaign, he died. Yuan Xie and Yuan Cheng kept his death secret until his body could be returned to Luoyang, and then announced his death. Yuan Ke succeeded to the throne as Emperor Xuanwu. By Emperor Xiaowen&#x27;s will, Empress Feng was forced to commit suicide.

<doc id="264740" wikidata="Q903420" url="?curid=264740" title="Isomerization">
<text>In chemistry, isomerization or isomerisation is the process in which a molecule, polyatomic ion or molecular fragment is transformed into an isomer with a different chemical structure. Enolization is an example of isomerization, as is tautomerization. 

When the activation energy for the isomerization reaction is sufficiently small, both isomers can often be observed and the equilibrium ratio will shift in a temperature-dependent equilibrium with each other. Many values of the standard free energy difference, formula_1, have been calculated, with good agreement between observed and calculated data.

==Examples and applications==
===Alkanes===
Skeletal isomerization occurs in the cracking process, used in the petrochemical industry to convert straight chain alkanes to isoparaffins as exemplified in the conversion of normal octane to 2,5-dimethylhexane (an &quot;isoparaffin&quot;):

Fuels containing branched hydrocarbons are favored for internal combustion engines for their higher octane rating. Diesel engines however operate better with straight-chain hydrocarbons.

===Alkenes===
====Cis vs trans====
Trans-alkenes are about 1 kcal/mol more stable than cis-alkenes. An example of this effect is cis- vs trans-2-butene. The difference is attributed to unfavorable non-bonded interactions in the cis isomer. This effects helps to explain the formation of trans-fats in food processing. In some cases, the isomerization can be reversed using UV-light. The &quot;trans&quot; isomer of resveratrol converts to the &quot;cis&quot; isomer in a photochemical reaction.

====Terminal vs internal====
Terminal alkenes prefer to isomerize to internal alkenes:
The conversion essentially does not occur in the absence of metal catalysts. This process is employed in the Shell higher olefin process to convert alpha-olefins to internal olefins, which are subjected to olefin metathesis.

===Other organic examples===
Isomerism is a major topic in sugar chemistry. Glucose, the most common sugar, exists in four forms.
Aldose-ketose isomerism, also known as Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformation, provides an example in saccharide chemistry.

===Inorganic and organometallic chemistry===
The compound with the formula  exists as three isomers in solution. In one isomer the CO ligands are terminal. When a pair of CO are bridging,
cis and trans isomers are possible depending on the location of the C5H5 groups.

Another example in organometallic chemistry is the linkage isomerization of decaphenylferrocene, .

<text>Robert Hilles (born November 13, 1951) is a Canadian poet and novelist.

He was born in Kenora, Ontario and grew up at Longbow Lake, Ontario. He left there in 1971 to attend university and later studied at the University of Calgary, earning a BA in Psychology and English in 1976. He also holds an MSc in Educational Psychology, earned at the university in 1985.

For ten years he acted as the managing editor of &quot;Dandelion&quot;, the oldest surviving literary magazine in Alberta. In 2001, he moved to British Columbia and has been active in the literary community there, especially on Salt Spring Island where he lived for 17 years. With other writers, he helped to set up a scholarship for beginning writers on Salt Spring and also organized a new reading series on the island. He moved to Nanaimo in 2019.

He served on the executive of the League of Canadian Poets for five years and in 1996 was sent by the League of Canadian Poets and the Department of Foreign Affairs to represent Canada at an International Poetry Festival in Japan. Hilles won the 1994 Governor General&#x27;s Award for Poetry for &quot;Cantos From A Small Room&quot; (1993). In the same year, his first novel, &quot;Raising of Voices&quot; (1993), won the Writers&#x27; Guild of Alberta&#x27;s George Bugnet Award for Novel. He has published sixteen books of poetry and five books of prose.

&quot;Wrapped Within Again, New and Selected Poems&quot; was published in the fall of 2003 and won the Stephan Stephansson Award for Poetry. His second novel, &quot;A Gradual Ruin&quot;, was published by Doubleday Canada in 2004. His books have also been shortlisted for the Milton Acorn People&#x27;s Poetry Prize, the W.O. Mitchell City of Calgary Book Prize, the Stephan G. Stephansson Award for Poetry, and the Howard O&#x27;Hagan Award for Short Fiction.

<text>Acoustix is a Dallas, Texas-based quartet that won the 1990 International Quartet Championship of SPEBSQSA (now Barbershop Harmony Society, or BHS). They have all, at different times, been members of the Dallas-based Vocal Majority chorus.

Acoustix shot to fame in 1990 at their first SPEBSQSA International Contest appearance in San Francisco, just six months after the quartet formed. They stormed to victory in the third round, overcoming 139th Street Quartet and The Naturals to take the gold medal home.

The original bass in the quartet during their championship was Jeff Oxley, who went on to direct the Masters of Harmony chorus from California to their fourth International Championship win in 1999. He also sang bass with the 1984 International Champion quartet The Rapscallions and Max Q, the 2007 International Champion quartet.

<doc id="264746" wikidata="Q970537" url="?curid=264746" title="Saturated fat">
<text>A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all single bonds between the carbon atoms. A fat known as a glyceride is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: a short glycerol backbone and fatty acids that each contain a long linear or branched chain of carbon (C) atoms. Along the chain, some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-). A double bond along the carbon chain can react with a pair of hydrogen atoms to change into a single -C-C- bond, with each H atom now bonded to one of the two C atoms. Glyceride fats without any carbon chain double bonds are called saturated because they are &quot;saturated with&quot; hydrogen atoms, having no double bonds available to react with more hydrogen.

Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated. Various foods contain different proportions of saturated and unsaturated. Many processed foods like foods deep-fried in hydrogenated oil and sausage are high in saturated fat content. Some store-bought baked goods are as well, especially those containing partially hydrogenated oils. Other examples of foods containing a high proportion of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol include animal fat products such as lard or schmaltz, fatty meats and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt, ice cream, cheese and butter. Certain vegetable products have high saturated fat content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. 

Guidelines released by many medical organizations, including the World Health Organization, have advocated for reduction in the intake of saturated fat to promote health and reduce the risk from cardiovascular diseases.
==Fat profiles==
While nutrition labels regularly combine them, the saturated fatty acids appear in different proportions among food groups. Lauric and myristic acids are most commonly found in &quot;tropical&quot; oils (e.g., palm kernel, coconut) and dairy products. The saturated fat in meat, eggs, cacao, and nuts is primarily the triglycerides of palmitic and stearic acids.

==Examples of saturated fatty acids==

Some common examples of saturated fatty acids:
*Lauric acid with 12 carbon atoms (contained in coconut oil, palm kernel oil, cow&#x27;s milk, and breast milk)
*Myristic acid with 14 carbon atoms (contained in cow&#x27;s milk and dairy products)
*Palmitic acid with 16 carbon atoms (contained in palm oil and meat)
*Stearic acid with 18 carbon atoms (also contained in meat and cocoa butter)
==Association with diseases==
===Cardiovascular disease===

The effect of saturated fat on heart disease has been extensively studied. Many health authorities, such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,&lt;ref name=&quot;ADA/DOC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the British Dietetic Association, American Heart Association, the World Heart Federation, the British National Health Service, among others, advise that saturated fat is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In 2020, the World Health Organization recommended lowering dietary intake of saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy consumption, and increasing intake of unsaturated fats. There is moderate-quality evidence that reducing the proportion of saturated fat in the diet and replacing it with unsaturated fats or carbohydrates for a period of at least two years leads to a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease. 

A 2017 review by the Sax Institute for the National Heart Foundation of Australia found that saturated fat consumption is associated with higher mortality and that replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat decreases risk of cardiovascular disease events and mortality. In 2019, the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition concluded that higher saturated fat consumption is associated with raised blood cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

A 2021 review found that diets high in saturated fat were associated with higher mortality from all causes, as well as from cardiovascular disease.

A 2023 review by the World Health Organization found convincing evidence that higher saturated fat consumption is associated with higher coronary heart disease incidence and mortality.

A 2023 review by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found moderate certainty evidence to support reducing saturated fat intake for reduced risk of CVD and CVD events.

A scoping review for Nordic Nutrition Recommendations 2023 found that partial replacement of saturated fatty acid with omega-6 fatty acid decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and improves the blood lipid profile.

A 2024 meta-analysis found that odd-chain and longer-chain saturated fatty acids were negatively associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke.

===Dyslipidemia===

The consumption of saturated fat is generally considered a risk factor for dyslipidemia, which in turn is a risk factor for some types of cardiovascular disease.

Abnormal blood lipid levels high total cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke.

Meta-analyses have found a significant relationship between saturated fat and serum cholesterol levels. High total cholesterol levels, which may be caused by many factors, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 

There are other pathways involving obesity, triglyceride levels, insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, and thrombogenicity, among others, that play a role in cardiovascular disease. Different saturated fatty acids have differing effects on various lipid levels. There is strong evidence that lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids raise LDL-C, while stearic acid is more neutral.

===Type 2 diabetes===
A 2022 review of cohort studies found that the risk of type 2 diabetes was not associated with dietary intake of total saturated fats, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. Dietary lauric acid and myristic acid, present in plant oils and also in dairy fat, were associated with reduced risk of diabetes.

===Cancer===
Several reviews of case–control studies have found that saturated fat intake is associated with breast cancer risk and mortality.

Observational studies have shown that a diet high in saturated fat increases the risk of prostate cancer.

==Dietary sources==
==Dietary recommendations==
Recommendations to reduce, limit or replace dietary intake of trans fats and saturated fats, in favor of unsaturated fats, are made by the World Health Organization, American Heart Association, Health Canada, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the UK National Health Service, the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, the Australian Department of Health and Aging, the Singapore Ministry of Health, the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the New Zealand Ministry of Health, and Hong Kong&#x27;s Department of Health.

In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) expert consultation report concluded:

A 2004 statement released by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) determined that &quot;Americans need to continue working to reduce saturated fat intake…&quot; In addition, reviews by the American Heart Association led the Association to recommend reducing saturated fat intake to less than 7% of total calories according to its 2006 recommendations. This concurs with similar conclusions made by the US Department of Health and Human Services, which determined that reduction in saturated fat consumption would positively affect health and reduce the prevalence of heart disease.

The United Kingdom, National Health Service claims the majority of British people eat too much saturated fat. The British Heart Foundation also advises people to cut down on saturated fat, and to read labels on the food they buy. The British Nutrition Foundation have said that based on the totality of available evidence the saturated fatty acids should make up no more than 10% of total dietary energy.

A 2004 review stated that &quot;no lower safe limit of specific saturated fatty acid intakes has been identified&quot; and recommended that the influence of varying saturated fatty acid intakes against a background of different individual lifestyles and genetic backgrounds should be the focus in future studies.

Blanket recommendations to lower saturated fat were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the American Dietetic Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing saturated fats rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates. Concern was expressed over the health risks of replacing saturated fats in the diet with refined carbohydrates, which carry a high risk of obesity and heart disease, particularly at the expense of polyunsaturated fats which may have health benefits. None of the panelists recommended heavy consumption of saturated fats, emphasizing instead the importance of overall dietary quality to cardiovascular health.

In a 2017 comprehensive review of the literature and clinical trials, the American Heart Association published a recommendation that saturated fat intake be reduced or replaced by products containing monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, a dietary adjustment that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by 30%.

==Molecular description==

 The two-dimensional illustration has implicit hydrogen atoms bonded to each of the carbon atoms in the polycarbon tail of the myristic acid molecule (there are 13 carbon atoms in the tail; 14 carbon atoms in the entire molecule).

Carbon atoms are also implicitly drawn, as they are portrayed as intersections between two straight lines. &quot;Saturated,&quot; in general, refers to a maximum number of hydrogen atoms bonded to each carbon of the polycarbon tail as allowed by the Octet Rule. This also means that only single bonds (sigma bonds) will be present between adjacent carbon atoms of the tail.

<text>An unsaturated fat is a fat or fatty acid in which there is at least one double bond within the fatty acid chain. A fatty acid chain is monounsaturated if it contains one double bond, and polyunsaturated if it contains more than one double bond.

A saturated fat has no carbon-to-carbon double bonds, so the maximum possible number of hydrogen is bonded to carbon, and thus, is considered to be &quot;saturated&quot; with hydrogen atoms. To form carbon-to-carbon double bonds, hydrogen atoms are removed from the carbon chain. In cellular metabolism, unsaturated fat molecules contain less energy (i.e., fewer calories) than an equivalent amount of saturated fat. The greater the degree of unsaturation in a fatty acid (i.e., the more double bonds in the fatty acid) the more susceptible it becomes to lipid peroxidation (rancidity). Antioxidants can protect unsaturated fat from lipid peroxidation.

==Composition of common fats==

In chemical analysis, fats are broken down to their constituent fatty acids, which can be analyzed in various ways. In one approach, fats undergo transesterification to give fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), which are amenable to separation and quantitation using gas chromatography. Classically, unsaturated isomers were separated and identified by argentation thin-layer chromatography.
The saturated fatty acid components are almost exclusively stearic (C18) and palmitic acids (C16). Monounsaturated fats are almost exclusively oleic acid. Linolenic acid comprises most of the triunsaturated fatty acid component.
== Chemistry and nutrition ==
Although polyunsaturated fats are protective against cardiac arrhythmias, a study of post-menopausal women with a relatively low fat intake showed that polyunsaturated fat is positively associated with progression of coronary atherosclerosis, whereas monounsaturated fat is not. This probably is an indication of the greater vulnerability of polyunsaturated fats to lipid peroxidation, against which vitamin E has been shown to be protective.

Examples of unsaturated fatty acids are palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, myristoleic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid. Foods containing unsaturated fats include avocado, nuts, olive oils, and vegetable oils such as canola. Meat products contain both saturated and unsaturated fats.

Although unsaturated fats are conventionally regarded as &#x27;healthier&#x27; than saturated fats, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation stated that the amount of unsaturated fat consumed should not exceed 30% of one&#x27;s daily caloric intake. Most foods contain both unsaturated and saturated fats. Marketers advertise only one or the other, depending on which one makes up the majority. Thus, various unsaturated fat vegetable oils, such as olive oils, also contain saturated fat.

== Membrane composition as a metabolic pacemaker ==
Studies on the cell membranes of mammals and reptiles discovered that mammalian cell membranes are composed of a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (DHA, omega-3 fatty acid) than reptiles. Studies on bird fatty acid composition have noted similar proportions to mammals but with 1/3rd less omega-3 fatty acids as compared to omega-6 for a given body size. This fatty acid composition results in a more fluid cell membrane but also one that is permeable to various ions (H+ &amp; Na+), resulting in cell membranes that are more costly to maintain. This maintenance cost has been argued to be one of the key causes for the high metabolic rates and concomitant warm-bloodedness of mammals and birds. However polyunsaturation of cell membranes may also occur in response to chronic cold temperatures as well. In fish increasingly cold environments lead to increasingly high cell membrane content of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, to maintain greater membrane fluidity (and functionality) at the lower temperatures.

<text>In astronomy and cosmology, baryonic dark matter is hypothetical dark matter composed of baryons. Only a small proportion of the dark matter in the universe is likely to be baryonic.

==Characteristics==
As &quot;dark matter&quot;, baryonic dark matter is undetectable by its emitted radiation, but its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter. This form of dark matter is composed of &quot;baryons&quot;, heavy subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons and combinations of these, including non-emitting ordinary atoms.

==Presence==
Baryonic dark matter may occur in non-luminous gas or in Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) – condensed objects such as black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, very faint stars, or non-luminous objects like planets and brown dwarfs.

==Estimates of quantity==
The total amount of baryonic dark matter can be inferred from models of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and observations of the cosmic microwave background. Both indicate that the amount of baryonic dark matter is much smaller than the total amount of dark matter.

===Big Bang nucleosynthesis===
From the perspective of Big Bang nucleosynthesis, a larger amount of ordinary (baryonic) matter implies a denser early universe, more efficient conversion of matter to helium-4, and less unburned deuterium remaining. If all of the dark matter in the universe were baryonic, then there would be much less deuterium in the universe than is observed. This could be resolved if more deuterium were somehow generated, but large efforts in the 1970s failed to identify plausible mechanisms for this to occur. For instance, MACHOs, which include, for example, brown dwarfs (bodies of hydrogen and helium with masses less than ), never begin nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but they do burn deuterium. Other possibilities that were examined include &quot;Jupiters&quot;, which are similar to brown dwarfs but have masses formula_1 and do not burn anything, and white dwarfs.

<doc id="264755" wikidata="Q167409" url="?curid=264755" title="Isham Jones">
<text>Isham Edgar Jones (January 31, 1894 – October 19, 1956) was an American bandleader, saxophonist, bassist and songwriter.

==Career==
Jones was born in Coalton, Ohio, United States, to a musical and mining family. His father, Richard Isham Jones (1865–1945), was a violinist. The family moved to Saginaw, Michigan, where Jones grew up and started his first ensemble for church concerts. In 1911 one of Jones&#x27;s earliest compositions &quot;On the Alamo&quot; was published by Tell Taylor Inc.

In 1915, Jones moved to Chicago, Illinois. He performed at the Green Mill Gardens, then began playing at Fred Mann&#x27;s Rainbo Gardens. Chicago remained his home until 1932, when he settled in New York City. He also toured England with his orchestra in 1925.
In 1917, he composed the tune &quot;We&#x27;re in the Army Now&quot; (also known as &quot;You&#x27;re in the Army Now&quot;) when the United States entered World War I. The same tune was popular during World War II and it is played by the U.S. Army Band.

The Isham Jones band made a series of popular gramophone records for Brunswick throughout the 1920s. His first 26 sides, made at Rainbo Gardens, were credited to &quot;Isham Jones&#x27; Rainbo Orchestra&quot;. By the end of 1920, the name was simply &quot;Isham Jones&#x27; Orchestra&quot;.

He led one of the most popular dance bands in the 1920s and 1930s. His first successful recording, &quot;Wabash Blues&quot; written by Dave Ringle and Fred Meinken, was recorded in 1921. This million-seller stayed for twelve weeks in the U.S. charts, six at No. 1. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Noted musicians who played in Jones&#x27;s band included Louis Panico, Benny Goodman (although no records were made during the short time he was there), Woody Herman, Walt Yoder, and Roy Bargy. Reed virtuoso Al Gallodoro appeared briefly with Jones in 1933, taking part in a record date October 3.

From the start, his Brunswick records were popular. There was a gap from October 1927 to June 1929 where Jones did not record due to disbanding and reorganization.

From 1929 to 1932, his Brunswick recordings became even more sophisticated with offbeat arrangements by Gordon Jenkins and others; Jones was his own arranger early on, but cultivated others. During this period, Jones started featuring violinist Eddie Stone as one of his regular vocalists. Stone had an unusual, almost humorous tone to his voice. His other vocalists included Frank Sylvano, Billy Scott, and Arthur Jarrett. In 1932, he added Joe Martin, another of the band&#x27;s violinists, as a frequent vocalist. In April that year, young Bing Crosby recorded two sessions with Jones&#x27;s group which included &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot;. Crosby at this point in his career was still singing in a jazz idiom, transitioning to his better known &quot;crooner&quot; style. 

In August 1932, Jones signed with Victor, and these records are considered among the best arranged and performed commercial dance band records of the Depression era. Victor&#x27;s recording technique was suited to Jones&#x27; band. In October 1932, he teamed up with the Three X Sisters in New York who had just departed from CBS radio. They recorded &quot;experimental&quot; songs for RCA Victor in which Jones began to fuse jazz and early swing music. They recorded &quot;Where? (I Wonder Where?)&quot; and &quot;What Would Happen to Me If Something Happened to You.&quot; His Victor releases had an almost symphonic sound, often with a strong use of tuba. During his Victor period, he recorded two long playing &quot;Program Transcription&quot; records as part of Victor&#x27;s unsuccessful 33 1/3 RPM series. He stayed with Victor until July 1934, when he signed with Decca. Jones&#x27;s recordings during this period rivaled Paul Whiteman, Waring&#x27;s Pennsylvanians, Leo Reisman and other dance orchestras as examples of the most popular dance music of the era.

Jones&#x27; Decca recordings are often unfavorably compared to his Victor recordings, due to Decca&#x27;s recording techniques, Decca&#x27;s insisting that Jones re-record many of his Victor recordings, and the apparent smaller size of his orchestra. After he left Decca in 1936, he again retired and his orchestra was taken over by band member Woody Herman. Jones started a new band in 1937–38 and recorded a handful of sessions under the ARC labels: Melotone, Perfect and Banner. 

In 1931, Jones performed at the Elitch Gardens Trocadero ballroom.

In the 1940s, Jones resided on his poultry farm in Colorado, which he occasionally left for short tours with pickup bands. He later resided in Los Angeles. He moved to Hollywood, Florida in 1955, and died there of cancer in 1956.

His great-nephew was jazz drummer Rusty Jones.

== Compositions ==

Isham Jones was the leader of one of America&#x27;s most popular dance bands in the first half of the 20th century, between the two World Wars. His remarkable string of chart-topping compositions between 1922 and 1925, in collaboration with lyricist Gus Kahn, and later with Charles Newman, included eight number 1 records, an unequaled body of work for a full-time band leader.

<doc id="264756" wikidata="Q1154050" url="?curid=264756" title="Peninsula campaign">
<text>The Peninsula campaign (also known as the Peninsular campaign) of the American Civil War was a major Union operation launched in southeastern Virginia from March to July 1862, the first large-scale offensive in the Eastern Theater. The operation, commanded by Major General George B. McClellan, was an amphibious turning movement against the Confederate States Army in Northern Virginia, intended to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. Despite the fact that Confederate spy Thomas Nelson Conrad had obtained documents describing McClellan&#x27;s battle plans from a double agent in the War Department, McClellan was initially successful against the equally cautious General Joseph E. Johnston, but the emergence of the more aggressive General Robert E. Lee turned the subsequent Seven Days Battles into a humiliating Union defeat.

McClellan landed his army at Fort Monroe and moved northwest, up the Virginia Peninsula. Confederate Brigadier General John B. Magruder&#x27;s defensive position on the Warwick Line caught McClellan by surprise. His hopes for a quick advance foiled, McClellan ordered his army to prepare for a siege of Yorktown. Just before the siege preparations had been completed, the Confederates, now under the direct command of Johnston, began a withdrawal toward Richmond. The first heavy fighting of the campaign occurred during the Battle of Williamsburg in which the Union troops managed some tactical victories, but the Confederates continued their withdrawal. An amphibious flanking movement to Eltham&#x27;s Landing was ineffective in cutting off the Confederate retreat. During the Battle of Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, an attempt by the US Navy to reach Richmond by way of the James River was repulsed.

As McClellan&#x27;s army reached the outskirts of Richmond, a minor battle occurred at Hanover Court House, but it was followed by a surprise attack by Johnston at the Battle of Seven Pines or Fair Oaks. The battle was inconclusive, with heavy casualties, but it had lasting effects on the campaign. Johnston was wounded by a Union artillery shell fragment on May 31 and replaced the next day by the more aggressive Robert E. Lee, who reorganized his army and prepared for offensive action in the final battles of June 25 to July 1, which are popularly known as the Seven Days Battles. The result was that the Union army was unable to enter Richmond, and both armies remained intact.

==Background==

===Military situation===
On August 20, 1861, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan formed the Army of the Potomac, with himself as its first commander. During the summer and fall, McClellan brought a high degree of organization to his new army, and greatly improved its morale by his frequent trips to review and encourage his units. It was a remarkable achievement, in which he came to personify the Army of the Potomac and reaped the adulation of his men. He created defenses for Washington that were almost impregnable, consisting of 48 forts and strong points, with 480 guns manned by 7,200 artillerists.

On November 1, 1861, Gen. Winfield Scott retired and McClellan became general in chief of all the Union armies. The president expressed his concern about the &quot;vast labor&quot; involved in the dual role of army commander and general in chief, but McClellan responded, &quot;I can do it all.&quot;

On January 12, 1862, McClellan revealed his intentions to transport the Army of the Potomac by ship to Urbanna, Virginia, on the Rappahannock River, outflanking the Confederate forces near Washington, and proceeding overland to capture Richmond. On January 27, Lincoln issued an order that required all of his armies to begin offensive operations by February 22, Washington&#x27;s birthday. On January 31, he issued a supplementary order for the Army of the Potomac to move overland to attack the Confederates at Manassas Junction and Centreville. McClellan immediately replied with a 22-page letter objecting in detail to the president&#x27;s plan and advocating instead his Urbanna plan, which was the first written instance of the plan&#x27;s details being presented to the president. Although Lincoln believed his plan was superior, he was relieved that McClellan finally agreed to begin moving, and reluctantly approved. On March 8, doubting McClellan&#x27;s resolve, Lincoln called a council of war at the White House in which McClellan&#x27;s subordinates were asked about their confidence in the Urbanna plan. They expressed their confidence to varying degrees. After the meeting, Lincoln issued another order, naming specific officers as corps commanders to report to McClellan (who had been reluctant to do so prior to assessing his division commanders&#x27; effectiveness in combat, even though this would have meant his direct supervision of twelve divisions in the field).

Before McClellan could implement his plans, the Confederate forces under General Joseph E. Johnston withdrew from their positions before Washington on March 9, assuming new positions south of the Rappahannock, which completely nullified the Urbanna strategy. McClellan retooled his plan so that his troops would disembark at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and advance up the Virginia Peninsula to Richmond. However, McClellan came under extreme criticism from the press and the Congress when it was found that Johnston&#x27;s forces had not only slipped away unnoticed, but had for months fooled the Union Army through the use of Quaker Guns.

A further complication for the campaign planning was the emergence of the first Confederate ironclad warship, CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, which threw Washington into a panic and made naval support operations on the James River seem problematic. In the Battle of Hampton Roads (March 8–9, 1862), &quot;Virginia&quot; defeated wooden U.S. Navy ships blockading the harbor of Hampton Roads, Virginia, including the frigates USS &quot;Cumberland&quot; and USS &quot;Congress&quot; on March 8, calling into question the viability of any of the wooden ships in the world. The following day, the USS &quot;Monitor&quot; ironclad arrived at the scene and engaged with the &quot;Virginia&quot;, the famous first duel of the ironclads. The battle, although inconclusive, received worldwide publicity. After the battle, it was clear that ironclad ships were the future of naval warfare. Neither ship severely damaged the other; the only net result was keeping &quot;Virginia&quot; from attacking any more wooden ships.

On March 11, 1862, Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief, leaving him in command of only the Army of the Potomac, ostensibly so that McClellan would be free to devote all his attention to the move on Richmond. Although McClellan was assuaged by supportive comments Lincoln made to him, in time he saw the change of command very differently, describing it as a part of an intrigue &quot;to secure the failure of the approaching campaign.&quot;

==Opposing forces==

===Union===

The Army of the Potomac had approximately 50,000 men at Fort Monroe when McClellan arrived in late March, but this number grew to 121,500 before hostilities began. The army was organized into three corps and other units, as follows:
* II Corps, Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. Israel B. Richardson and John Sedgwick
* III Corps, Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. Fitz John Porter, Joseph Hooker, and Charles S. Hamilton
* IV Corps, Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes commanding: divisions of Brig. Gens. Darius N. Couch, William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith, and Silas Casey
* 1st Division of the I Corps, Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin commanding
* Reserve infantry commanded by Brig. Gen. George Sykes
* Cavalry commanded by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman
* The garrison of Fort Monroe, 12,000 men under Maj. Gen. John E. Wool; Wool was quickly transferred to another department for duty in Baltimore after the War Department realized that he technically outranked McClellan.

===Confederate===


On the Confederate side, Johnston&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia (newly named as of March 14) was organized into three wings, each composed of several brigades, as follows:
* Left Wing, Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill commanding: brigades of Brig. Gen. Robert E. Rodes, Winfield S. Featherston, Jubal A. Early, and Gabriel J. Raines
* Center Wing, Maj. Gen. James Longstreet commanding: brigades of Brig. Gens. A. P. Hill, Richard H. Anderson, George E. Pickett, Cadmus M. Wilcox, Raleigh E. Colston, and Roger A. Pryor
* Right Wing, Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder commanding: division of Brig. Gen. Lafayette McLaws (brigades of Brig. Gens. Paul J. Semmes, Richard Griffith, Joseph B. Kershaw, and Howell Cobb) and division of Brig. Gen. David R. Jones (brigades of Brig. Gens. Robert A. Toombs and George T. Anderson)
* Reserve force commanded by Maj. Gen. Gustavus W. Smith
* Cavalry commanded by Brig. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart

However, at the time the Army of the Potomac arrived, only Magruder&#x27;s 11,000 men faced them on the Peninsula. The bulk of Johnston&#x27;s force (43,000 men) were at Culpeper, 6,000 under Maj. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes at Fredericksburg, and 9,000 under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Huger at Norfolk. In Richmond, General Robert E. Lee had returned from work on coastal fortifications in the Carolinas and on March 13 became the chief military adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis.

Forces in the Shenandoah Valley played an indirect role in the campaign. Approximately 50,000 men under Maj. Gens. Nathaniel P. Banks and Irvin McDowell were engaged chasing a much smaller force under Stonewall Jackson in the Valley Campaign. Jackson&#x27;s expert maneuvering and tactical success in small battles kept the Union men from reinforcing McClellan, much to his dismay. He had planned to have 30,000 under McDowell to join him.

Magruder had prepared three defensive lines across the Peninsula. The first, about north of Fort Monroe, contained infantry outposts and artillery redoubts, but was insufficiently manned to prevent any Union advance. Its primary purpose was to shield information from the Union about a second line extending from Yorktown to Mulberry Island. This Warwick Line consisted of redoubts, rifle pits, and fortifications behind the Warwick River. By enlarging two dams on the river, the river was turned into a significant military obstacle in its own right. The third defensive line was a series of forts at Williamsburg, which waited unmanned for use by the army if it had to fall back from Yorktown.

==Initial movements==

===Movement to the Peninsula and the siege of Yorktown===

McClellan&#x27;s army began to sail from Alexandria on March 17. It was an armada that dwarfed all previous American expeditions, transporting 121,500 men, 44 artillery batteries, 1,150 wagons, over 15,000 horses, and tons of equipment and supplies. An English observer remarked that it was the &quot;stride of a giant.&quot;

With the &quot;Virginia&quot; still in operation, the U.S. Navy could not assure McClellan that they could protect operations on either the James or the York, so his plan of amphibiously enveloping Yorktown was abandoned, and he ordered an advance up the Peninsula to begin April 4.

On April 5, the IV Corps of Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes made initial contact with Confederate defensive works at Lee&#x27;s Mill, an area McClellan expected to move through without resistance. Magruder, a fan of theatrics, set up a successful deception campaign. By moving one company in circles through a glen, he gained the appearance of an endless line of reinforcements marching to relieve him. He also spread his artillery very far apart and had it fire sporadically at the Union lines. Federals were convinced that his works were strongly held, reporting that an army of 100,000 was in their path. As the two armies fought an artillery duel, reconnaissance indicated to Keyes the strength and breadth of the Confederate fortifications, and he advised McClellan against assaulting them. McClellan ordered the construction of siege fortifications and brought his heavy siege guns to the front. In the meantime, Gen. Johnston brought reinforcements for Magruder.

McClellan chose not to attack without more reconnaissance and ordered his army to entrench in works parallel to Magruder&#x27;s and besiege Yorktown. McClellan reacted to Keyes&#x27;s report, as well as to reports of enemy strength near the town of Yorktown, but he also received word that the I Corps, under Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell, would be withheld for the defense of Washington, instead of joining him on the Peninsula as McClellan had planned. In addition to the pressure of Jackson&#x27;s Valley campaign, President Lincoln believed that McClellan had left insufficient force to guard Washington and that the general had been deceptive in his reporting of unit strengths, counting troops as ready to defend Washington when they were actually deployed elsewhere. McClellan protested that he was being forced to lead a major campaign without his promised resources, but he moved ahead anyway. For the next 10 days, McClellan&#x27;s men dug while Magruder steadily received reinforcements. By mid April, Magruder commanded 35,000 men, barely enough to defend his line.

Although McClellan doubted his numeric superiority over the enemy, he had no doubts about the superiority of his artillery. The siege preparations at Yorktown consisted of 15 batteries with more than 70 heavy guns. When fired in unison, these batteries would deliver over 7,000 pounds of ordnance onto the enemy positions with each volley.
On April 16, Union forces probed a point in the Confederate line at Dam No. 1, on the Warwick River near Lee&#x27;s Mill. Magruder realized the weakness of his position and ordered it strengthened. Three regiments under Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb, with six other regiments nearby, were improving their position on the west bank of the river overlooking the dam. McClellan became concerned that this strengthening might impede his installation of siege batteries. He ordered Brig. Gen. William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith, a division commander in the IV Corps, to &quot;hamper the enemy&quot; in completing their defensive works.

At 3 p.m., four companies of the 3rd Vermont Infantry crossed the dam and routed the remaining defenders. Behind the lines, Cobb organized a defense with his brother, Colonel Thomas Cobb of the Georgia Legion, and attacked the Vermonters, who had occupied the Confederate rifle pits. Unable to obtain reinforcements, the Vermont companies withdrew across the dam, suffering casualties as they retreated. At about 5 p.m., Baldy Smith ordered the 6th Vermont to attack Confederate positions downstream from the dam while the 4th Vermont demonstrated at the dam itself. This maneuver failed as the 6th Vermont came under heavy Confederate fire and were forced to withdraw. Some of the wounded men were drowned as they fell into the shallow pond behind the dam.

For the remainder of April, the Confederates, now at 57,000 and under the direct command of Johnston, improved their defenses while McClellan undertook the laborious process of transporting and placing massive siege artillery batteries, which he planned to deploy on May 5. Johnston knew that the impending bombardment would be difficult to withstand, so began sending his supply wagons in the direction of Richmond on May 3. Escaped slaves reported that fact to McClellan, who refused to believe them. He was convinced that an army whose strength he estimated as high as 120,000 would stay and fight. On the evening of May 3, the Confederates launched a brief bombardment of their own and then fell silent. Early the next morning, Heintzelman ascended in one of Lowe&#x27;s observation balloons and found that the Confederate earthworks were empty.

McClellan was stunned by the news. He sent cavalry under Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in pursuit and ordered Brig. Gen. William B. Franklin&#x27;s division to reboard Navy transports, sail up the York River, and cut off Johnston&#x27;s retreat.

==Battles==

===Williamsburg===

By May 5, Johnston&#x27;s army was making slow progress on muddy roads and Stoneman&#x27;s cavalry was skirmishing with Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry, Johnston&#x27;s rearguard. To give time for the bulk of his army to get free, Johnston detached part of his force to make a stand at a large earthen fortification, Fort Magruder, straddling the Williamsburg Road (from Yorktown), constructed earlier by Magruder. The Battle of Williamsburg was the first pitched battle of the Peninsula campaign, in which nearly 41,000 Union and 32,000 Confederates were engaged.

Brig. Gen. Joseph Hooker&#x27;s 2nd Division of the III Corps was the lead infantry in the Union Army advance. They assaulted Fort Magruder and a line of rifle pits and smaller fortifications that extended in an arc southwest from the fort, but were repulsed. Confederate counterattacks, directed by Maj. Gen. James Longstreet, threatened to overwhelm Hooker&#x27;s division, which had contested the ground alone since the early morning while waiting for the main body of the army to arrive. Hooker had expected Baldy Smith&#x27;s division of the IV Corps, marching north on the Yorktown Road, to hear the sound of battle and come in on Hooker&#x27;s right in support. However, Smith had been halted by Sumner more than a mile away from Hooker&#x27;s position. He had been concerned that the Confederates would leave their fortifications and attack him on the Yorktown Road.

Longstreet&#x27;s men did leave their fortifications, but they attacked Hooker, not Smith or Sumner. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox applied strong pressure to Hooker&#x27;s line. Hooker&#x27;s retreating men were aided by the arrival of Brig. Gen. Philip Kearny&#x27;s 3rd Division of the III Corps at about 2:30 p.m. Kearny ostentatiously rode his horse out in front of his picket lines to reconnoiter and urged his men forward by flashing his saber with his only arm. The Confederates were pushed off the Lee&#x27;s Mill Road and back into the woods and the abatis of their defensive positions. There, sharp firefights occurred until late in the afternoon.

Brig. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock&#x27;s 1st Brigade of Baldy Smith&#x27;s division, which had marched a few miles to the Federal right and crossed Cub&#x27;s Creek at the point where it was dammed to form the Jones&#x27;s Mill pond, began bombarding Longstreet&#x27;s left flank around noon. Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill, commanding Longstreet&#x27;s reserve force, had previously detached a brigade under Brig. Gen. Jubal A. Early and posted them on the grounds of the College of William &amp; Mary. Splitting his command, Early led two of his four regiments through the woods without performing adequate reconnaissance and found that they emerged not on the enemy&#x27;s flank, but directly in front of Hancock&#x27;s guns, which occupied two abandoned redoubts. He personally led the 24th Virginia Infantry on a futile assault and was wounded by a bullet through the shoulder.

Hancock had been ordered repeatedly by Sumner to withdraw his command back to Cub Creek, but he used the Confederate attack as an excuse to hold his ground. As the 24th Virginia charged, D. H. Hill emerged from the woods leading one of Early&#x27;s other regiments, the 5th North Carolina. He ordered an attack before realizing the difficulty of his situation—Hancock&#x27;s 3,400 infantrymen and eight artillery pieces significantly outnumbered the two attacking Confederate regiments, fewer than 1,200 men with no artillery support. He called off the assault after it had begun, but Hancock ordered a counterattack. After the battle, the counterattack received significant publicity as a major, gallant bayonet charge and McClellan&#x27;s description of Hancock&#x27;s &quot;superb&quot; performance gave him the nickname, &quot;Hancock the Superb.&quot;

Confederate casualties at Williamsburg were 1,682, Union 2,283. McClellan miscategorized his first significant battle as a &quot;brilliant victory&quot; over superior forces. However, the defense of Williamsburg was seen by the South as a means of delaying the Federals, which allowed the bulk of the Confederate army to continue its withdrawal toward Richmond.

===Eltham&#x27;s Landing (or West Point)===

After McClellan ordered Franklin&#x27;s division to turn Johnston&#x27;s army with an amphibious operation on the York River, it took two days just to board the men and equipment onto the ships, so Franklin was of no assistance to the Williamsburg action. But McClellan had high hopes for his turning movement, planning to send other divisions (those of Brig. Gens. Fitz John Porter, John Sedgwick, and Israel B. Richardson) by river after Franklin&#x27;s. Their destination was Eltham&#x27;s Landing on the south bank of the Pamunkey River across from West Point, a port on the York River, which was the terminus of the Richmond and York River Railroad. The landing was close to a key intersection on the road to New Kent Court House that was being used by Johnston&#x27;s army on the afternoon of May 6.

Franklin&#x27;s men came ashore in light pontoon boats and built a floating wharf to unload artillery and supplies. The work was continued by torchlight through the night and the only enemy resistance was a few random shots fired by Confederate pickets on the bluff above the landing, ending at about 10 p.m.

Johnston ordered Maj. Gen. G. W. Smith to protect the road to Barhamsville and Smith assigned the division of Brig. Gen. William H. C. Whiting and Hampton&#x27;s Legion, under Col. Wade Hampton, to the task. On May 7, Franklin posted Brig. Gen. John Newton&#x27;s brigade in the woods on either side of the landing road, supported in the rear by portions of two more brigades (Brig. Gens. Henry W. Slocum and Philip Kearny). Newton&#x27;s skirmish line was pushed back as Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood&#x27;s Texas Brigade advanced, with Hampton to his right.

As a second brigade followed Hood on his left, the Union troops retreated from the woods to the plain before the landing, seeking cover from the fire of Federal gunboats. Whiting employed artillery fire against the gunboats, but his guns had insufficient range, so he disengaged around 2 p.m. Union troops moved back into the woods after the Confederates left, but made no further attempt to advance. Although the action was tactically inconclusive, Franklin missed an opportunity to intercept the Confederate retreat from Williamsburg, allowing it to pass unmolested.

===Norfolk and Drewry&#x27;s Bluff===

President Lincoln witnessed part of the campaign, having arrived at Fort Monroe on May 6 in the company of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase on the Treasury Department&#x27;s revenue cutter &quot;Miami&quot;. Lincoln believed that the city of Norfolk was vulnerable and that control of the James was possible, but McClellan was too busy at the front to meet with the president. Exercising his direct powers as commander in chief, Lincoln ordered naval bombardments of Confederate batteries in the area on May 8 and set off in a small boat with his two Cabinet secretaries to conduct a personal reconnaissance on shore. Troops under the command of Maj. Gen. John E. Wool, the elderly commander of Fort Monroe, occupied Norfolk on May 10, encountering little resistance.

After the Confederate garrison at Norfolk was evacuated, Commodore Josiah Tattnall III knew that CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; had no home port and he could not navigate her deep draft through the shallow stretches of the James River toward Richmond, so she was scuttled on May 11 off Craney Island to prevent her capture. This opened the James River at Hampton Roads to Federal gunboats.

The only obstacle that protected Richmond from a river approach was Fort Darling on Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, overlooking a sharp bend on the river down river from the city. The Confederate defenders, including marines, sailors, and soldiers, were supervised by Cammander Ebenezer Farrand of the navy and by Captain Augustus H. Drewry of the army, the owner of the property that bore his name. The eight cannons in the fort, including field artillery pieces and five naval guns, some salvaged from the &quot;Virginia&quot;, commanded the river for miles in both directions. Guns from the CSS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;, including an smoothbore, were just upriver and sharpshooters gathered on the river banks. An underwater obstruction of sunken steamers, pilings, debris, and other vessels connected by chains was placed just below the bluff, making it difficult for vessels to maneuver in the narrow river.

On May 15, a detachment of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, under the command of Commander John Rodgers steamed up the James River from Fort Monroe to test the Richmond defenses. At 7:45 a.m., the USS &quot;Galena&quot; closed to within of the fort and anchored, but before she could open fire, two Confederate rounds pierced the lightly armored vessel. The battle lasted over three hours and during that time, &quot;Galena&quot; remained almost stationary and took 45 hits. Her crew reported casualties of 14 dead or mortally wounded and 10 injured. &quot;Monitor&quot; was also a frequent target, but her heavier armor withstood the blows. Contrary to some reports, the &quot;Monitor&quot;, despite its squat turret, did not have difficulty bringing its guns to bear and fired steadily against the fort. The USS &quot;Naugatuck&quot; withdrew when her 100-pounder Parrott rifle exploded. The two wooden gunboats remained safely out of range of the big guns, but the captain of the USS &quot;Port Royal&quot; was wounded by a sharpshooter. Around 11 a.m. the Union ships withdrew to City Point.

The massive fort on Drewry&#x27;s Bluff had blunted the Union advance just short of the Confederate capital. Rodgers reported to McClellan that it was feasible for the Navy to land troops as close as from Richmond, but the Union Army never took advantage of this observation.

===Armies converge on Richmond===
Johnston withdrew his 60,000 men into the Richmond defenses. Their defensive line began at the James River at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff and extended counterclockwise so that his center and left were behind the Chickahominy River, a natural barrier in the spring when it turned the broad plains to the east of Richmond into swamps. Johnston&#x27;s men burned most of the bridges over the Chickahominy and settled into strong defensive positions north and east of the city. McClellan positioned his 105,000-man army to focus on the northeast sector, for two reasons. First, the Pamunkey River, which ran roughly parallel to the Chickahominy, offered a line of communication that could enable McClellan to get around Johnston&#x27;s left flank. Second, McClellan anticipated the arrival of McDowell&#x27;s I Corps, scheduled to march south from Fredericksburg to reinforce his army, and thus needed to protect their avenue of approach.

The Army of the Potomac pushed slowly up the Pamunkey, establishing supply bases at Eltham&#x27;s Landing, Cumberland Landing, and White House Landing. White House, the plantation of W.H.F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee, son of General Robert E. Lee, became McClellan&#x27;s base of operations. Using the Richmond and York River Railroad, McClellan could bring his heavy siege artillery to the outskirts of Richmond. He moved slowly and deliberately, reacting to faulty intelligence that led him to believe the Confederates outnumbered him significantly. By the end of May, the army had built bridges across the Chickahominy and was facing Richmond, straddling the river, with one third of the Army south of the river, two thirds north. (This disposition, which made it difficult for one part of the army to reinforce the other quickly, would prove to be a significant problem in the upcoming Battle of Seven Pines).

On May 18, McClellan reorganized the Army of the Potomac in the field and promoted two major generals to corps command: Fitz John Porter to the new V Corps and William B. Franklin to the VI Corps. The army had 105,000 men in position northeast of the city, outnumbering Johnston&#x27;s 60,000, but faulty intelligence from the detective Allan Pinkerton on McClellan&#x27;s staff caused the general to believe that &quot;he&quot; was outnumbered two to one. Numerous skirmishes between the lines of the armies occurred from May 23 to May 26. Tensions were high in the city, particularly following the earlier sounds of the naval gun battle at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff.

===Hanover Court House===

While skirmishing occurred all along the line between the armies, McClellan heard a rumor that a Confederate force of 17,000 was moving to Hanover Court House, north of Mechanicsville. If this were true, it would threaten the army&#x27;s right flank and complicate the arrival of McDowell&#x27;s reinforcements. A Union cavalry reconnaissance adjusted the estimate of the enemy strength to be 6,000, but it was still cause for concern. McClellan ordered Porter and his V Corps to deal with the threat.

Porter departed on his mission at 4 a.m. on May 27 with his 1st Division, under Brig. Gen. George W. Morell, the 3rd Brigade of Brig. Gen. George Sykes&#x27;s 2nd Division, under Col. Gouverneur K. Warren, and a composite brigade of cavalry and artillery led by Brig. Gen. William H. Emory, altogether about 12,000 men. The Confederate force, which actually numbered about 4,000 men, was led by Col. Lawrence O&#x27;Bryan Branch. They had departed from Gordonsville to guard the Virginia Central Railroad, taking up position at Peake&#x27;s Crossing, southwest of the courthouse, near Slash Church. Another Confederate brigade was stationed north at Hanover Junction.

Porter&#x27;s men approached Peake&#x27;s Crossing in a driving rain. At about noon on May 27, his lead element skirmished briskly with the Confederates until Porter&#x27;s main body arrived, driving the outnumbered Confederates up the road in the direction of the courthouse. Porter set out in pursuit with most of his force, leaving three regiments to guard the New Bridge and Hanover Court House Roads intersection. This movement exposed the rear of Porter&#x27;s command to attack by the bulk of Branch&#x27;s force, which Porter had mistakenly assumed was at Hanover Court House.

Branch also made a poor assumption—that Porter&#x27;s force was significantly smaller than it turned out to be—and attacked. The initial assault was repulsed, but Martindale&#x27;s force was eventually almost destroyed by the heavy fire. Porter quickly dispatched the two regiments back to the Kinney Farm. The Confederate line broke under the weight of thousands of new troops and they retreated back through Peake&#x27;s Crossing to Ashland.

The estimates of Union casualties at Hanover Court House vary, from 355 (62 killed, 233 wounded, 70 captured) to 397. The Confederates left 200 dead on the field and 730 were captured by Porter&#x27;s cavalry. McClellan claimed that Hanover Court House was yet another &quot;glorious victory over superior numbers&quot; and judged that it was &quot;one of the handsomest things of the war.&quot; However, the reality of the outcome was that superior (Union) numbers won the day in a disorganized fight, characterized by misjudgments on both sides. The right flank of the Union army remained secure, although technically the Confederates at Peake&#x27;s Crossing had not intended to threaten it. And McDowell&#x27;s Corps did not need its roads kept clear because it never arrived—the defeat of Union forces at the First Battle of Winchester by Stonewall Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley caused the Lincoln administration to recall McDowell to Fredericksburg.

A greater impact than the actual casualties, according to Stephen W. Sears, was the effect on McClellan&#x27;s preparedness for the next major battle, at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks four days later. During the absence of Porter, McClellan was reluctant to move more of his troops south of the Chickahominy, making his left flank a more attractive target for Johnston. He was also confined to bed, ill with a flare-up of his chronic malaria.

===Seven Pines (or Fair Oaks)===

Johnston knew that he could not survive a massive siege of Richmond and decided to attack McClellan. His original plan was to attack the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, before McDowell&#x27;s corps, marching south from Fredericksburg, could arrive. However, on May 27, Johnston learned that McDowell&#x27;s corps had been diverted to the Shenandoah Valley and would not be reinforcing the Army of the Potomac. He decided against attacking across his own natural defense line, the Chickahominy, and planned to capitalize on the Union army&#x27;s straddle of the river by attacking the two corps south of the river, leaving them isolated from the other three corps north of the river.

If executed correctly, Johnston would engage two thirds of his army (22 of its 29 infantry brigades, about 51,000 men) against the 33,000 men in the III and IV Corps. The Confederate attack plan was complex, calling for the divisions of A.P. Hill and Magruder to engage lightly and distract the Union forces north of the river, while Longstreet, commanding the main attack south of the river, was to converge on Keyes from three directions. The plan had an excellent potential for initial success because the division of the IV Corps farthest forward, manning the earthworks a mile west of Seven Pines, was that of Brig. Gen. Silas Casey, 6,000 men who were the least experienced in Keyes&#x27;s corps. If Keyes could be defeated, the III Corps, to the east, could then be pinned against the Chickahominy and overwhelmed.

The complex plan was mismanaged from the start. Johnston issued orders that were vague and contradictory and failed to inform all of his subordinates about the chain of command. On Longstreet&#x27;s part, he either misunderstood his orders or chose to modify them without informing Johnston, changing his route of march to collide with Hill&#x27;s, which not only delayed the advance, but limited the attack to a narrow front with only a fraction of its total force. Exacerbating the problems on both sides was a severe thunderstorm on the night of May 30, which flooded the river, destroyed most of the Union bridges, and turned the roads into morasses of mud.

The attack got off to a bad start on May 31 when Longstreet marched down the Charles City Road and turned onto the Williamsburg Road instead of the Nine Mile Road. Huger&#x27;s orders had not specified a time that the attack was scheduled to start and he was not awakened until he heard a division marching nearby. Johnston and his second-in-command, Smith, unaware of Longstreet&#x27;s location or Huger&#x27;s delay, waited at their headquarters for word of the start of the battle. Five hours after the scheduled start, at 1 p.m., D.H. Hill became impatient and sent his brigades forward against Casey&#x27;s division.

Casey&#x27;s line buckled with some men retreating, but fought fiercely for possession of their earthworks, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Confederates only engaged four brigades of the thirteen on their right flank that day, so they did not hit with the power that they could have concentrated on this weak point in the Union line. Casey sent for reinforcements but Keyes was slow in responding. Eventually the mass of Confederates broke through, seized a Union redoubt, and Casey&#x27;s men retreated to the second line of defensive works at Seven Pines.

Hill, now strengthened by reinforcements from Longstreet, hit the secondary Union line near Seven Pines around 4:40 p.m. Hill organized a flanking maneuver to attack Keyes&#x27;s right flank, which collapsed the Federal line back to the Williamsburg Road. Johnston went forward on the Nine Mile Road with three brigades of Whiting&#x27;s division and encountered stiff resistance near Fair Oaks Station, the right flank of Keyes&#x27;s line. Soon heavy Union reinforcements arrived. Brig. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner, II Corps commander, heard the sounds of battle from his position north of the river. On his own initiative, he dispatched a division under Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick over the sole remaining bridge. The treacherous &quot;Grapevine Bridge&quot; was near collapse on the swollen river, but the weight of the crossing troops helped to hold it steady against the rushing water. After the last man had crossed safely, the bridge collapsed and was swept away. Sedgwick&#x27;s men provided the key to resisting Whiting&#x27;s attack.

At dusk, Johnston was wounded and evacuated to Richmond. G.W. Smith assumed temporary command of the army. Smith, plagued with ill health, was indecisive about the next steps for the battle and made a bad impression on President Davis and General Lee, Davis&#x27;s military adviser. After the end of fighting the following day, Davis replaced Smith with Lee as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia.

On June 1, the Confederates under Smith renewed their assaults against the Federals, who had brought up more reinforcements and fought from strong positions, but made little headway. The fighting ended about 11:30 a.m. when the Confederates withdrew. McClellan arrived on the battlefield from his sick bed at about this time, but the Union Army did not counterattack.

Both sides claimed victory with roughly equal casualties—Union casualties were 5,031 (790 killed, 3,594 wounded, 647 captured or missing), Confederate 6,134 (980 killed, 4,749 wounded, 405 captured or missing). McClellan&#x27;s advance on Richmond was halted and the Army of Northern Virginia fell back into the Richmond defensive works. The battle was frequently remembered by the Union soldiers as the Battle of Fair Oaks Station because that is where they did their best fighting, whereas the Confederates, for the same reason, called it Seven Pines.

==The Seven Days Battles==

Despite claiming victory at Seven Pines, McClellan was shaken by the experience. He redeployed all of his army except for the V Corps south of the river, and although he continued to plan for a siege and the capture of Richmond, he lost the strategic initiative and never regained it.

Lee used the month-long pause in McClellan&#x27;s advance to fortify the defenses of Richmond and extend them south to the James River at Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. On the south side of the James River, defensive lines were built south to a point below Petersburg. The total length of the new defensive line was about . To buy time to complete the new defensive line and prepare for an offensive, Lee repeated the tactic of making a small number of troops seem larger than they really were. McClellan was also unnerved by Jeb Stuart&#x27;s audacious (but otherwise militarily pointless) cavalry ride completely around the Union army (June 13–15).

The second phase of the Peninsula campaign took a negative turn for the Union when Lee launched fierce counterattacks just east of Richmond in the Seven Days Battles (June 25July 1, 1862). Although none of these battles were significant Confederate tactical victories (and the Battle of Malvern Hill on the last day was a significant Confederate defeat), the tenacity of Lee&#x27;s attacks and the sudden appearance of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s &quot;foot cavalry&quot; on his western flank unnerved McClellan, who pulled his forces back to a base on the James River. Lincoln later ordered the army to return to the Washington, D.C., area to support Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s army in the northern Virginia campaign and the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Virginia Peninsula was relatively quiet until May 1864, when Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler again invaded as part of the Bermuda Hundred campaign.

<text>A pamphlet is an unbound book (that is, without a hard cover or binding). Pamphlets may consist of a single sheet of paper that is printed on both sides and folded in half, in thirds, or in fourths, called a &quot;leaflet&quot; or it may consist of a few pages that are folded in half and saddle stapled at the crease to make a simple book.

For the &quot;International Standardization of Statistics Relating to Book Production and Periodicals&quot;, UNESCO defines a pamphlet as &quot;a non-periodical printed publication of at least 5 but not more than 48 pages, exclusive of the cover pages, published in a particular country and made available to the public&quot; and a book as &quot;a non-periodical printed publication of at least 49 pages, exclusive of the cover pages&quot;. The UNESCO definitions are, however, only meant to be used for the particular purpose of drawing up their book production statistics.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pamphlet&quot; for a small work (&quot;opuscule&quot;) issued by itself without covers came into Middle English as or , generalized from a twelfth-century amatory comic poem with a satiric flavor, &quot;Pamphilus, seu de Amore&quot; (&#x27;Pamphilus: or, Concerning Love&#x27;), written in Latin. Pamphilus&#x27;s name is derived from the Greek name , meaning &quot;beloved of all&quot;. The poem was popular and widely copied and circulated on its own, forming a slim codex.

==History==

The earliest appearance of the word is in &quot;The Philobiblon&quot; (1344; ch. viii) of Richard de Bury, who speaks of &quot;&quot; {&#x27;little pamphlets&#x27;}.

Its modern connotations of a tract concerning a contemporary issue was a product of the heated arguments leading to the English Civil War; this sense appeared in 1642. In some European languages, this secondary connotation, of a disputatious tract, has come to the fore: compare &quot;libelle&quot;, from the Latin &quot;libellus&quot;, denoting a &quot;little book&quot;.

Pamphlets functioned in place of magazine articles in the pre-magazine era, which ended in the mid-nineteenth century. There were hundreds of them in the United States alone. They were a primary means of communication for people interested in political and religious issues, such as slavery. Pamphlets never looked at both sides of a question; most were avowedly partisan, trying not just to inform but to convince the reader.

==Purpose==

Pamphlets can contain anything from information on kitchen appliances to medical information and religious treatises. Pamphlets are very important in marketing because they are cheap to produce and can be distributed easily to customers. Pamphlets have also long been an important tool of political protest and political campaigning for similar reasons.

A pamphleteer is a historical term for someone who produces or distributes pamphlets, especially for a political cause.

==Collectibility==

Due to their ephemeral nature and to the wide array of political and religious perspectives given voice by the format&#x27;s ease of production, pamphlets are prized by many book collectors. Substantial accumulations have been amassed and transferred to ownership of academic research libraries around the world.

Particularly comprehensive collections of American political pamphlets are housed at New York Public Library, the Tamiment Library of New York University, and the Jo Labadie collection at the University of Michigan.

==Commercial uses==

The pamphlet has been widely adopted in commerce, particularly as a format for marketing communications. There are numerous purposes for pamphlets, such as product descriptions or instructions, corporate information, events promotions or tourism guides and they are often used in the same way as leaflets or brochures.

<text>Family Affair is an American sitcom starring Brian Keith and Sebastian Cabot that aired on CBS from September 12, 1966, to March 4, 1971. The series explored the trials of well-to-do engineer and bachelor Bill Davis (Keith) as he attempted to raise his brother&#x27;s orphaned children in his luxury New York City apartment. Davis&#x27; traditional English gentleman&#x27;s gentleman, Mr. Giles French (Cabot), also had adjustments to make as he became saddled with the responsibility of caring for 15-year-old Cissy (Kathy Garver) and the six-year-old twins, Jody (Johnny Whitaker) and Buffy (Anissa Jones).

&quot;Family Affair&quot; ran for 138 episodes in five seasons. The show was created and produced by Edmund Hartmann and Don Fedderson, also known for &quot;My Three Sons&quot; and &quot;The Millionaire&quot;.

==Storyline==
Indiana native William &quot;Bill&quot; Davis is a successful civil engineer who develops major projects all over the world. A wealthy bachelor, Bill lives in a large apartment on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, and has a British manservant, Giles French (usually called &quot;Mr. French&quot; or just &quot;French&quot;), as his valet.

A year prior to the series, Bill&#x27;s brother Bob and his wife Mary were killed in a car crash in Indiana, orphaning their three children – teenager Cissy, and younger twins Jody and Buffy. His other relatives believe that Bill is the one most capable of supporting them, so the three move in with him in New York. Consequently, Bill&#x27;s bachelor lifestyle gets turned upside down.

Initially, &quot;Uncle Bill&quot; is none too pleased to have the three youngsters living with him, but he soon grows fond of them. Mr. French, who effectively becomes a nanny in addition to his valet duties, is also flustered by the erratic situation at first, but he, too, develops an affinity for them. Over time, the bachelor, the butler, and the three orphans find themselves becoming a close-knit family.

=== Other characters ===

When Sebastian Cabot became ill, Giles&#x27; brother, Nigel &quot;Niles&quot; French (John Williams) was introduced. He worked for the Davis family for nine episodes in 1967, while Giles was said to be touring with the Queen in the Commonwealth countries. In the final season, Bill hired a part-time housekeeper, Emily Turner (Nancy Walker), to assist Mr. French.

Various other characters were also seen regularly, including several acquaintances of Mr. French who are in service (most notably Miss Faversham, played by Heather Angel), colleagues of Bill&#x27;s, and friends of Cissy&#x27;s.

==Production==
Due to Don Fedderson&#x27;s strong track record, &quot;Family Affair&quot; was sold to CBS even before the pilot had been filmed.

As Fedderson&#x27;s other program, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, had done for Fred MacMurray, &quot;Family Affair&quot; used a 60-day production schedule to accommodate Brian Keith. All of his scenes for the season would be shot in two 30-day blocks, while his co-stars would fill in after the actor&#x27;s work was completed. This enabled Fedderson to harness movie stars like Keith and MacMurray into television commitments, while still enabling each to make motion pictures. As a result, each season had a single director for each of the 30-odd scripts.

Since the show&#x27;s child actors (Whitaker and Jones) could only legally work eight hours a day, scenes with them were shot first, and as a result the cast and crew were often filming as many as four episodes at the same time.

Due to the popularity of the series with girls, Buffy&#x27;s doll, &quot;Mrs. Beasley&quot; (which she often carried with her), was marketed as a Mattel talking toy in the United States. Mattel went on to produce two additional dolls, as well, patterned after Buffy: the &quot;Tutti&quot;-sized Buffy and larger &quot;Small Talk Buffy&quot; (talking doll), both of which featured accompanying miniature Mrs. Beasley dolls.

==Opening==
The theme song was composed by veteran television composer Frank DeVol. The opening featured credits appearing over a kaleidoscopic view of a multicolored array of gems and precious stones.

Most of the episodes in the fifth season opened with either Sebastian Cabot or the twins saying, &quot;Good evening, so nice of you to join us,&quot; and closing the episode saying, &quot;It&#x27;s been very good of you to watch and we do hope to see you again next week on &quot;Family Affair&quot;.&quot;

==Cast==

* Brian Keith as Bill Davis - The part was first offered to Glenn Ford, who turned it down. Keith also held part ownership of the show.
* Sebastian Cabot as Giles French 
* Kathy Garver as Catherine &quot;Cissy&quot; Davis - Garver was cast at the last minute, in the middle of shooting the pilot, after the actress originally cast for the part gained 15 pounds on a trip to Europe. Garver, though playing a teenage girl, was 20 years old at the time of filming. No scenes were filmed with Garver&#x27;s predecessor.
* Johnny Whitaker as Jonathan &quot;Jody&quot; Davis - Keith suggested Whitaker for the role. Jody and Buffy were originally supposed to be different ages, but after seeing how good Whitaker looked with Anissa Jones, who had already been cast, the producers decided to change them to twins.

<text>The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), founded on 15 September 1883, is one of the largest non-governmental organisations in India engaged in conservation and biodiversity research. It supports many research efforts through grants and publishes the &quot;Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&quot;. Many prominent naturalists, including the ornithologists Sálim Ali and S. Dillon Ripley, have been associated with it.

==History==

British hunters in Bombay organized a hunting group around 1811, their activities included riding with foxhounds and shooting. A Bombay Hunt was supported by Sir Bartle Frere from 1862. A natural history society was begun, possibly as spinoff from the Bombay Geographical Society, in 1856 by Doctors Don (of Karachee), Andrew Henderson Leith (surgeon), George Buist, and Henry John Carter along with Lawrence Hugh Jenkins, then a registrar of the Supreme Court. The group did not last more than three years. On 15 September 1883 eight men interested in natural history met at Bombay in the Victoria and Albert Museum (now Bhau Daji Lad Museum) and:

According to E. H. Aitken (the first honorary secretary, September 1883-March 1886), Dr D. MacDonald was the &quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;source and origin&quot;) of the society. The other founders were Dr G. A. Maconachie, Col. C. Swinhoe, Mr J. C. Anderson, Mr J. Johnston, Dr Atmaram Pandurang and Dr Sakharam Arjun. Mr H. M. Phipson (second honorary secretary, 1886–1906) was a part of the founding group. He lent a part of his wine shop at 18 Forbes Street to the BNHS as an office.

In 1911, R. C. Wroughton, a BNHS member and forest officer, organised a survey of mammals making use of the members spread through the Indian subcontinent to provide specimens. This was perhaps the first collaborative natural history study in the world. It resulted in a collection of 50,000 specimens in 12 years. Several new species were discovered, 47 publications were published, and the understanding of biogeographic boundaries was improved.

In the early years, the &quot;Journal of the BNHS&quot; reviewed contemporary literature from other parts of the world. The description of ant-bird interactions in German by Erwin Stresemann was reviewed in a 1935 issue leading to the introduction of the term &quot;anting&quot; into English.

Today the BNHS is headquartered in the specially constructed &#x27;Hornbill House&#x27; in southern Mumbai. It sponsors studies in Indian wildlife and conservation, and publishes a four-monthly journal, &quot;Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society&quot;, as well as a quarterly magazine, &quot;Hornbill&quot;.

BNHS is the partner of BirdLife International in India. It has been designated as a &#x27;Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation&#x27; by the Department of Science and Technology. Its headquarter is in Mumbai and has one regional centre at Wetland Research and Training Centre, near Chilika Lake, Odisha.

==BNHS logo==

The BNHS logo is the great hornbill, inspired by a great hornbill named William, who lived on the premises of the Society from 1894 until 1920, during the honorary secretaryships of H. M. Phipson until 1906 and W. S. Millard from 1906 to 1920. The logo was created in 1933, the golden jubilee year of the Society&#x27;s founding.

===William===
According to H. M. Phipson, William was born in May 1894 and presented to the Society three months later by H. Ingle of Karwar. He reached his full length () by the end of his third year. His diet consisted of fruit (like plantains and wild figs) and also of live mice, scorpions, and plain raw meat, which he ate with relish. He apparently did not drink water, nor use it for bathing. William was known for catching tennis balls thrown at him from a distance of some 30 feet with his beak.

In his obituary of W. S. Millard, Sir Norman Kinnear made the following remarks about William: 

==Initiatives==
===National Dragonfly festival===
The festival was started in 2018 in order to inform the public about integral role played by dragonflies in our environment. The Bombay Natural History Society has been organising the festival since then in association with WWF India, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme and National Biodiversity Board of India. The local events which are the part of this nationwide festival are also organised by WWF India in association with various state agencies. The &quot;Thumbimahotsavam&quot; is a state butterfly festival of Kerala which is organised as a part of National Dragonfly festival.

===Asian Waterbird census===
The Asian waterbird census is an annual exercise undertaken in India by Bombay Natural History Society in association with Wetlands International, in which enthusiastic birdwatchers count the birds by observing them near their respective breeding grounds. The exercise is a part of &#x27;International waterbird census&#x27;, an international exercise. It also aims to create awareness regarding bird species as well as health of the wetlands, which are facing severve threat amidst anthropogenic disturbance. It is conducted in the month of January every year.

Education Programmes

The BNHS Programme Department, currently led by Mr Asif N. Khan is an integral component of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), focuses on education, research, and outreach initiatives.

<doc id="264772" wikidata="Q3246610" url="?curid=264772" title="Eugene Airport">
<text>Eugene Airport , also known as Mahlon Sweet Field, is a public airport 7 miles (11 km) northwest of Eugene, in Lane County, Oregon, United States. Owned and operated by the City of Eugene, it is the fifth-largest airport in the Pacific Northwest.

The terminal building has &quot;A&quot; gates on the upper level and &quot;B&quot; gates, ticketing, and baggage claim on the lower level. The airport has an expanded air cargo facility and three fixed-base operators (FBOs) to handle general aviation. In 2024, the Eugene Airport handled 1,682,311 passengers, a 2.17% decrease from the previous year.

The airport was named for Mahlon Sweet (1886–1947), a Eugene automobile dealer who was a strong supporter of aviation and pushed to get the now-defunct Eugene Air Park built in 1919, followed by the current airfield in 1943.

In 2010, a new airport rescue and firefighting facility was built.

EUG covers 2,600 acres (1,052 ha) of land.

== History ==
At the request of Mahlon Sweet, the original Eugene Air Park was built in 1919 at what is now the southeast corner of West 18th Avenue and Chambers Street (). This first airstrip took care of all aviation operations until the modern Mahlon Sweet Field opened in 1943. The original site ceased operations in the summer of 1956.

During World War II, the airfield was used by the United States Army Air Forces. The December 1951 C&amp;GS diagram shows three runways forming an asterisk: the 026-deg runway was in length, the 111-deg was , and the 158-deg was .

<text>Sir Thomas Smith (23 December 151312 August 1577) was an English scholar, parliamentarian and diplomat.

==Early life==

Born at Saffron Walden in Essex, Smith was the second son of John Smith of Walden by Agnes, daughter of John Charnock of Lancashire. The Smiths of Essex are said to be descendants of Sir Roger de Clarendon, an illegitimate son of the Black Prince. He was educated at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, where he became a Fellow in 1530, and, in 1533, was appointed a public reader or professor. He lectured in the schools on natural philosophy, and on Greek in his own College. In 1540, Smith went abroad, and, after studying in France and Italy and taking a degree in law at the University of Padua, he returned to Cambridge in 1542.

He took the lead in the reform of the pronunciation of Greek, his views being universally adopted after considerable controversy. He and his friend, Sir John Cheke, were the great classical scholars of the time in England. In January 1543/44 he was appointed the first Regius Professor of Civil Law. He was vice-chancellor of the university the same year. In 1547, he became Provost of Eton College and Dean of Carlisle Cathedral.

Sir Thomas was an early convert to Protestantism, which brought him into prominence when Edward VI came to the throne. During the protectorate of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, he entered public life and was made the Secretary of State, and was sent on an important diplomatic mission to Brussels. In 1548, he was knighted. On the accession of Queen Mary I he lost all his offices, but in the reign of her sister, Elizabeth I, he was prominently employed in public affairs.

He was returned as Member of Parliament for Liverpool in 1559. It became clear that he supported the religious settlement and Confessions of Westminster (1560), sitting on two committees of Inquiry. When an expert handler of the son of the King of Sweden visiting Westminster, he was sent in 1562 as ambassador to France as an emerging diplomatic talent; he remained in France from September 1562 with experienced envoy Sir Nicholas Throckmorton.

Smith came to dagger blows with Throckmorton over character and policy differences. He returned from France in disgrace after suffering illness in April 1566. Nonetheless, Smith remained one of Elizabeth&#x27;s most trusted Protestant counsellors. He had long been a friend of Sir William Cecil. Ennobled as Lord Burghley, Cecil appointed Smith to the Privy Council, only a month before he was elected to Commons as a knight of the shire for Essex. Smith, a prime mover behind the Conformity Bills, sought to restrain extremism and secure a subsidy from his fellow members. But when he proposed that the bishops be consulted, the puritan William Fleetwood defeated his motion. As a Privy Councillor he was influential on a number of committees. He spoke on the Treason Bill on the floor of the house, and examined witnesses to the Catholic plot led by the Duke of Norfolk. He was noted as upholding a religious objection to torture. His outstanding work elevated him to the higher ministerial echelons: in 1572 he was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter and in July, principal secretary.

In 1572, Smith again went to France as an ambassador for a short time, and attended the receptions held at the arrival of Lord Clinton. Smith, Clinton, and Francis Walsingham had an audience with Catherine de&#x27; Medici at the Madrid Palace (while she was in bed) and Charles IX of France showed them her gardens and banqueting pavilion at the Tuileries Palace.

==Failed colony in Ireland==
In 1571, Elizabeth I granted Smith of East Ulster. The lands were to be used to plant English settlers in an effort to control areas claimed by Clandeboye O&#x27;Neill territory and thus control the native Irish. The grant included all of the area known today as North Down and the Ards, apart from the southern tip of the Ards peninsula which was controlled by the Anglo-Norman Savage family.

Unfortunately for Smith, the booklet he printed to advertise his new lands was read by the Clandeboye O&#x27;Neill chief, Sir Brian MacPhelim, who just a few years earlier had been knighted by Elizabeth. Furious at what he saw as her &quot;duplicity&quot; in secretly arranging for the colonisation of unsettled areas claimed by O&#x27;Neill, he burned down all the major buildings in the area. The owners objected, but could do nothing. This made it difficult for the plantation to take hold. Then launching a wave of attacks on these early English settlers when they arrived, the O&#x27;Neills scorched the land Smith was to develop, burning abbeys, monasteries and churches, and leaving Clandeboye &quot;totally waste and void of inhabitants&quot;.

Smith, who was also a Member of Parliament for Essex in 1571 and 1572, died on 12 August 1577 at Hill Hall in Essex.

==Marriages and heirs==
Smith married twice. First he wed Elizabeth Carkeke, daughter of a London printer, April 15, 1548; she died in 1553. His second marriage, which took place July 23, 1554, was to Philippa Wilford, the widow of Sir John Hampden of Great Hampden, Buckinghamshire, and the daughter of the London merchant Henry Wilford. She died 15 June 1578.

Smith had no issue by either marriage, although he had one illegitimate son named Thomas, who was killed during the failed Ards settlement. His heirs were his younger brother, George, and George&#x27;s son, Sir William Smith (died 12 December 1626) of Theydon Mount, Essex. Sir William Smith&#x27;s daughter, Frances Smith, married Sir Matthew Brend, owner of the land on which the first and second Globe Theatres were built. Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, was brought up in Smith&#x27;s house and his early education was supervised by him.

Smith left his books to Queen&#x27;s College, Cambridge, except a few volumes that he had given to rector of Theydon Mount. He made provision for finishing the building of Hill Hall in his will, and a monument for himself and his wife (designed by Richard Kyrbie). Lady Phillipa Smith&#x27;s will details some of the furnishings of Hill Hall.

==Works==
Sir Thomas Smith&#x27;s book &quot;De Republica Anglorum: the of or of the of England&quot;, written between 1562 and 1565, was first published in 1583. In it, he described England as a mixed government and a commonwealth, and stated that all commonwealths are of mixed character.

Smith also authored &quot;De recta &amp; emendata lingvæ Anglicæ scriptione, dialogus&quot; (&quot;Correct and Improved English Writing, a Dialogue&quot;, 1568).

<text>An ibex (: ibex, ibexes or ibices) is any of several species of wild goat (genus &quot;Capra&quot;), distinguished by the male&#x27;s large recurved horns, which are transversely ridged in front. Ibex are found in Eurasia, North Africa and East Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;ibex&quot; comes from Latin, borrowed from Iberian or Aquitanian, akin to Old Spanish &quot;bezerro&quot;, &#x27;bull&#x27;, modern Spanish &quot;becerro&quot;, &#x27;yearling&#x27;. Ranging in height from and weighing for males, ibex can live up to 20 years. Three closely related varieties of goats found in the wild are not usually called ibex: the markhor, western tur, and eastern tur.

A male ibex is referred to as a buck, a female is a doe, and young juveniles are called kids. An ibex buck is commonly larger and heavier than a doe. The most noticeable difference between the sexes is the larger size of a buck&#x27;s horns. The doe grows a pair of smaller, thinner horns which develop considerably more slowly than those of a buck. The ibex&#x27;s horns appear at birth and continue to grow through the rest of its life.

==Known ibex==
Species of wild goats that are called ibex are:

* The Asian ibex also known as the Siberian ibex (&quot;Capra sibirica&quot;) is a wild goat inhabiting long mountain systems in central Asian deserts and the northwestern Himalayas. The animal is 80–100 cm high at shoulder, and weighs an average 60 kg. The adult males have long pointed beards and scimitar-shaped horns with prominent ridges on the frontal surface. The coat is dark brown with greyish underparts, and a dorsal stripe runs from the neck to tail. Adult males also have grey saddle patches on their backs. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, as the females are smaller with small straight horns that are widely separated at the base. Asiatic ibex is widely distributed over an area stretching from the Hindu Kush Mountains in Afghanistan to Sayan Mountains in Mongolia. The animals are found most frequently at elevations ranging from 3000 to 5300 m above sea level, but are also known to occur in areas as low as 1000 m in the Altai Mountains. They have a predilection for rugged terrain as an anti-predator strategy.
* The Alpine Ibex (&quot;Capra ibex&quot;) is found in the European Alps. Alpine ibex are found in France, Bulgaria, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Germany and Slovenia, and have been introduced to ranches in the United States, Canada and Argentina.
* The Iberian ibex (&quot;Capra pyrenaica&quot;), formerly called Spanish ibex, is restricted to mountainous enclaves of the Iberian Peninsula, in Spain, Portugal and the French Pyrenees, but in the past it also occurred in southern France. There are approximately 50,000 Iberian ibex living. Two subspecies have become extinct. One of those, the Pyrenean Ibex, was cloned in 2003, but the resulting individual died very quickly.
* The Nubian ibex (&quot;Capra nubiana&quot;) inhabits the desert regions of the Middle East, as well as the Itbay region of Sudan and Egypt. They are the smallest ibex species and adapted for arid environments with a tan color, white underbelly and rump, black legs, and dark tail. This species is Vulnerable, with less than 4,500 individuals in the wild. The population is declining through most of its range.
* The Walia or Ethiopian ibex (&quot;Capra walie&quot;) is found in the Semien Mountains of the Ethiopian Highlands, where it has recently been upgraded from critically endangered to endangered. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of Alpine Ibex. The Ibex was also a national emblem of the Axumite Empire.
* The wild goat (&quot;Capra aegagrus&quot;), also known as West Asian ibex, is found in Turkey and the Caucasus in the west to Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east, and is the ancestor of the domestic goat.

==History==
Evidence of the ibex is widely present in the archaeological record, particularly in the Near East and Mediterranean regions. Ibex motifs are very common on cylinder seals and pottery, both painted and embossed.
Excavations from Minoan Crete at Knossos, for example, have yielded specimens from , including one cylinder seal depicting an ibex defending himself from a hunting dog. From the similar age a gold jewelry ibex image was found at the Akrotiri archaeological site on Santorini in present day Greece.

An Iron Age &quot;Capra ibex&quot; specimen was recovered at the Aq Kupruk Archaeological site in present day Afghanistan, illustrating either domestication or hunting of the ibex by these early peoples. However, archaeological records of ibex can be difficult to separate from those of domestic goats.
Earlier evidence of domestication or hunting of the ibex was found identified through DNA analysis of the contents of the stomach of Ötzi, the natural mummy of a Chalcolithic man discovered in the Ötztal Alps in 1991, who lived between 3400 and 3100 BCE. According to DNA reconstruction, the man&#x27;s penultimate meal contained ibex. There is a myth that says Ibex used to have wings in a time and they used to fly back in dates, by time their wings disappeared and they started climbing the mountain.

In Yemen, the ibex is a longstanding symbol of national identity, representing many positive attributes of the Yemeni people. Numbers of the animal – primarily the Nubian ibex – declined significantly from the late 20th century, due to hunting. In 2022, activists and intellectuals urged the declaration of an annual National Ibex Day, on 22 January, along with calls for greater protection of the animal.

Further Information: 

==Rescue from extinction==
When firearms spread in the 15th century, the large population of ibex that spanned many of Europe&#x27;s mountains decreased as they became easy targets for hunters. The ibex was often hunted for its meat, with other body parts used for medicine. The ibex horns were highly sought after as a remedy for impotence, while its blood was used for treating kidney stones.

The relentless hunting of the ibex might have led to its extinction were it not for the foresight of the dukes of Savoy. Charles-Felix, Duke of Savoy and King of Sardinia, banned the hunting of the ibex across his estates of the Gran Paradiso after being persuaded by a report on the animal&#x27;s endangered state. The ban was implemented on 12 September 1821 and its law was soon extended to the rest of the kingdom. In 1856, Victor Emmanuel II, succeeding Charles-Felix as the king, inducted the Gran Paradiso as a protected hunting estate along with appointed gamekeepers to patrol the area.

<text>The term &quot;white-collar crime&quot; refers to financially motivated, nonviolent or non-directly violent crime committed by individuals, businesses and government professionals. The crimes are believed to be committed by middle- or upper-class individuals for financial gains. It was first defined by the sociologist Edwin Sutherland in 1939 as &quot;a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of their occupation&quot;. Typical white-collar crimes could include wage theft, fraud, bribery, Ponzi schemes, insider trading, labor racketeering, embezzlement, cybercrime, copyright infringement, money laundering, identity theft, and forgery. White-collar crime overlaps with corporate crime. White-collar crimes often lead to extradition requests, especially for fraud, money laundering, and corruption. However, such cases can be contested on grounds like due process violations, political motivations, or risks of unfair treatment.

==Definitional issues==
Modern criminology generally prefers to classify the type of crime and the topic:
*By the type of offense, e.g., property crime, economic crime, and other corporate crimes like environmental and health and safety law violations. Some crimes are only possible because of the offender&#x27;s identity, e.g., transnational money laundering requires the participation of senior officers employed in banks. However, the FBI has adopted the narrow approach, defining white-collar crime as &quot;those illegal acts which are characterized by deceit, concealment, or violation of trust and which are not dependent upon the application or threat of physical force or violence&quot; (1989, 3). While the true extent and cost of white-collar crime are unknown, the FBI and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimate the annual cost to the United States to fall between $300 and $660 billion.
* By the type of offender, e.g., by social class or high socioeconomic status, the occupation of positions of trust or profession, or academic qualification, researching the motivations for criminal behavior, e.g., greed or fear of loss of face if economic difficulties become obvious. Shover and Wright point to the essential neutrality of a crime as enacted in a statute. It almost inevitably describes conduct in the abstract, not by reference to the character of the persons performing it. Thus, the only way that one crime differs from another is in the backgrounds and characteristics of its perpetrators.
* By organizational culture rather than the offender or offense which overlaps with organized crime. Appelbaum and Chambliss offer a twofold definition:
** Occupational crime occurs when crimes are committed to promote personal interests, say, by altering records and overcharging, or by cheating of clients by professionals.
** Organizational or corporate crime occurs when corporate executives commit criminal acts to benefit their company by overcharging or price fixing, false advertising, etc.

==Relationship to other types of crime==

===Blue-collar crime===

The types of crime committed are a function of what is available to the potential offender. Thus, those employed in relatively unskilled environments have fewer opportunities to exploit than those who work in situations where large financial transactions occur. Blue-collar crime tends to be more obvious and thus attracts more active police attention such as vandalism or shoplifting. In contrast, white-collar employees can incorporate legitimate and criminal behavior, thus making themselves less obvious when committing the crime. Therefore, blue-collar crime will more often use physical force. In contrast, the corporate world, the identification of a victim is less obvious and the issue of reporting is complicated by a culture of commercial confidentiality to protect shareholder value. It is estimated that a great deal of white-collar crime is undetected or, if detected, it is not reported.

===Corporate crime===

Corporate crime benefits the corporation (company or other type of business organization), rather than individuals. It may, however, result from the decisions of high-ranking individuals within the corporation. Corporations are not, unlike individuals, litigated in criminal courts, which means the term &quot;crime&quot; does not really apply. Litigation usually takes place in civil courts or by institutions with jurisdiction over specific types of offences, such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission which litigates violations of financial market and investment statutes.

===State-corporate crime===

State-corporate crime is “illegal or socially injurious actions that occur when one or more institutions or political governance pursue a goal in direct cooperation with one or more institutions of economic production and distribution.” The negotiation of agreements between a state and a corporation will be at a relatively senior level on both sides, this is almost exclusively a white-collar &quot;situation&quot; which offers the opportunity for crime. Although law enforcement claims to have prioritized white-collar crime, evidence shows that it continues to be a low priority.

When senior levels of a corporation engage in criminal activity using the company this is sometimes called control fraud.

===Organized transnational crime===
Organized transnational crime is organized criminal activity that takes place across national jurisdictions, and with advances in transportation and information technology, law enforcement officials and policymakers have needed to respond to this form of crime on a global scale. Some examples include human trafficking, money laundering, drug smuggling, illegal arms dealing, terrorism, and cybercrime. Although it is impossible to precisely gauge transnational crime, the Millennium Project, an international think tank, assembled statistics on several aspects of transnational crime in 2009:
*World illicit trade of almost $780 billion
*Counterfeiting and piracy of $300 billion to $1 trillion
*Global drug trade of $321 billion

===Red-collar crime===
When a white-collar criminal turns violent, it becomes red-collar crime. This can take the form of killing a witness in a fraud trial to silence them or murdering someone who exposed the fraud, such as a journalist, detective or whistleblower. Perri and Lichtenwald defined red-collar crime as follows:“This sub-group is referred to as red-collar criminals because they straddle both the white-collar crime arena and, eventually, the violent crime arena. In circumstances where there is the threat of detection, red-collar criminals commit brutal acts of violence to silence the people who have detected their fraud and to prevent further disclosure.”According to a 2018 report by the Bureau of Labour Statistics, homicide is the third highest cause of death in the American workplace. The Atlantic magazine reported that red-collar criminals often have traits of narcissism and psychopathy, which ironically, are seen as desirable qualities in the recruitment process, even though it puts a company at risk of employing a white-collar criminal.

One investigator, Richard G. Brody, said that the murders might be difficult to detect, being mistaken for accidents or suicides:

“Whenever I read about high-profile executives who are found dead, I immediately think red-collar crime,” he said. “Lots of people are getting away with murder.”

===Occupational crime===
Occupational crime is “any act punishable by law that is committed through opportunity created on the course of an occupation that is legal.” Individuals may commit crimes during employment or unemployment. The two most common forms are theft and fraud. Theft can be of varying degrees, from a pencil to furnishings to a car. Insider trading, the trading of stock by someone with access to publicly unavailable information, is a type of fraud.

===Crimes related to national interests===
The crimes related to the national interests consist mainly of treason. In the modern world, there are a lot of nations which divide crimes into some laws. &quot;Crimes Related to Inducement of Foreign Aggression&quot; is the crime of communicating with aliens secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. &quot;Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression&quot; is the treason of cooperating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. &quot;Crimes Related to Insurrection&quot; is the internal treason. Depending on the country, criminal conspiracy is added to these. One example is Jho Low, a Malaysian businessman and international fugitive who stole billions of US dollars from 1MDB, a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.

==Demographics==
According to a 2016 American study, A considerable percentage of white-collar offenders are gainfully employed middle-aged Caucasian men who usually commit their first white-collar offense sometime between their late thirties through their mid-forties and appear to have middle-class backgrounds. Most have some higher education, are married, and have moderate to strong ties to community, family, and religious organizations. Whitecollar offenders usually have a criminal history, including infractions that span the spectrum of illegality, but many do not overindulge in vice. Recent research examining the five-factor personality trait model determined that white-collar offenders tend to be more neurotic and less agreeable and conscientious than their non-criminal counterparts.

==Punishment==
In the United States, sentences for white-collar crimes may include a combination of imprisonment, fines, restitution, community service, disgorgement, probation, or other alternative punishment. These punishments grew harsher after the Jeffrey Skilling and Enron scandal, when the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush, defining new crimes and increasing the penalties for crimes such as mail and wire fraud. Sometimes punishment for these crimes could be hard to determine due to the fact that convincing the courts that what the offender has done is challenging within itself. In other countries, such as China, white-collar criminals can be given the death penalty under aggravating circumstances, yet some countries have a maximum of 10–25 years imprisonment. Certain countries like Canada consider the relationship between the parties to be a significant feature of a sentence when there is a breach of trust component involved. Questions about sentencing disparity in white-collar crime continue to be debated. The FBI, concerned with identifying this type of offense, collects statistical information on several different fraud offenses (swindles and cons, credit card or ATM fraud, impersonation, welfare fraud, and wire fraud), bribery, counterfeiting and forgery, and embezzlement.

In the United States, the longest sentences for white-collar crimes have included the following: Sholam Weiss (845 years for racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering in connection with the collapse of National Heritage Life Insurance Company); Norman Schmidt and Charles Lewis (330 years and 30 years, respectively, for &quot;high-yield investment&quot; scheme); Bernard Madoff (150 years for $65 billion fraud scheme); Frederick Brandau (55 years for $117 million Ponzi scheme); Martin Sigillito (40 years for $56 million Ponzi scheme); Eduardo Masferrer (30 years for accounting fraud); Chalana McFarland (30 years for mortgage fraud scheme); Lance Poulsen (30 years for $2.9 billion fraud).

== Theories ==

From the perspective of an offender, the easiest targets to entrap in &quot;white collar&quot; crime are those with a certain degree of vulnerability or those with symbolic or emotional value to the offender. Examples of these people can be family members, clients, and close friends who are wrapped up in personal or business proceedings with the offender. The way that most criminal operations are conducted is through a series of different particular techniques. In this case, a technique is a certain way to complete a desired task. When one is committing a crime, whether it be shoplifting or tax fraud, it is always easier to successfully pull off the task with experience in the technique. Shoplifters who are experienced at stealing in plain sight are much more successful than those who do not know how to steal. The major difference between a shoplifter and someone committing a white-collar crime is that the techniques used are not physical but instead consist of acts like talking on the phone, writing, and entering data.

Often these criminals utilize the &quot;blame game theory&quot;, a theory in which certain strategies are utilized by an organization or business and its members in order to strategically shift blame by pushing responsibility to others or denying misconduct. This theory is particularly used in terms of organizations and indicates that offenders often do not take the blame for their actions. Many members of organizations will try to absolve themselves of responsibility when things go wrong.

Forbes Magazine lays out four theories for what leads a criminal to commit a &quot;white collar&quot; crime. The first is that there are poorly designed job incentives for the criminal. Most finance professionals are given a certain type of compensation or reward for short-term mass profits. If a company incentivizes an employee to help commit a crime, such as assisting in a Ponzi Scheme, many employees will partake in order to receive the reward or compensation. Often, this compensation is given in the form of a cash &quot;bonus&quot; on top of their salaries. By doing a task in order to receive a reward, many employees feel as though they are not responsible for the crime, as they have not ordered it. The &quot;blame game theory&quot; comes into play as those being asked to carry out illegal activities feel as though they can place the blame on their bosses instead of themselves. The second theory is that the company&#x27;s management is very relaxed when it comes to enforcing ethics. If unethical practices are already commonplace in the business, employees will see that as a &quot;green light&quot; to conduct unethical and unlawful business practices to further the business. This idea also ties into Forbes&#x27; third theory, that most stock traders see unethical practices as harmless. Many see white-collar crime as a victimless crime, which is not necessarily true. Since many of these stock traders cannot see the victims of their crimes, it seems as if it hurts no one. The last theory is that many firms have unrealistic, large goals. They preach the mentality that employees should &quot;do what it takes&quot;.

<text>Sir John Cheke (or Cheek; 16 June 1514 – 13 September 1557) was an English classical scholar and statesman. One of the foremost teachers of his age, and the first Regius Professor of Greek at the University of Cambridge, he played a great part in the revival of Greek learning in England. He was tutor to Prince Edward, the future King Edward VI, and also sometimes to Princess Elizabeth. Of strongly Reformist sympathy in religious affairs, his public career as provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Member of Parliament and briefly as Secretary of State during King Edward&#x27;s reign was brought to a close by the accession of Queen Mary in 1553. He went into voluntary exile abroad, at first under royal licence (which he overstayed). He was captured and imprisoned in 1556, and recanted his faith to avoid death by burning. He died not long afterward, reportedly regretting his decision.

== Origins and earlier career ==
The Cheke or Cheeke family is said to have originated in Northamptonshire and to be descended from Sir William de Butevillar. At the time of John&#x27;s birth, the family seat had been, for more than a century, at Mottistone in the Isle of Wight. John&#x27;s father, Peter Cheke of Cambridge (the son of Robert Cheke of Mottistone), was Esquire Bedell of the University of Cambridge from 1509 until his death in 1529. John&#x27;s mother was Agnes Duffield, daughter of Andrew Duffield of Cambridge: John was born in that city in 1514, and had five sisters, Ann, Alice, Elizabeth, Magdalen, and Mary. His grammatical education was begun by John Morgan, M.A. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, where he proceeded to receive a B.A. in 1529, and obtained a Fellowship. He commenced with an M.A. in 1533. His tutor was George Day, who became an opponent of the Edwardian Reformation.

At university, Cheke, and his friend, Thomas Smith (a student of Civil Law at Queens&#x27; College), were thought so outstanding that each was granted an exhibition by King Henry to support them in their studies. Both were largely impressed by the classical learning of John Redman, who had studied in Paris, and sought to emulate him. Both Queens&#x27; College (where the influence of Erasmus remained) and St John&#x27;s fostered Reformist principles which Cheke and Smith embraced.

During the early 1530s Cheke and Smith studied together privately to restore proper definition to the pronunciation of ancient Greek diphthongs, which by custom had become obscured. The language itself, its cadences and inflexions of meaning, thereby gained new life and the works of the ancient scholars and orators were freshly received and understood. Smith, giving Greek lectures from 1533, around 1535 began to make public trial of these effects, and soon gained a following. Smith&#x27;s student John Poynet, succeeding his tutor, maintained the new pronunciation in his lectures: both Cheke and Smith began to coach students in their method, and the &quot;Plutus&quot; of Aristophanes was acted at St. John&#x27;s in the new manner. After Poynet as Greek Reader came Roger Ascham, Cheke&#x27;s student, who read Isocrates, at first disputing but afterwards coming round fully to the innovations, which also won the approval of John Redman.

=== Academic manoeuvres ===

Through the mediation of Matthew Parker, Cheke obtained the support of Anne Boleyn for his student William Bill to continue his studies. After a year as Master of St John&#x27;s, and as University Vice-Chancellor, George Day was appointed by King Henry to be provost of King&#x27;s College in 1538, Smith having become University Orator in 1537 in succession to him. In 1540, at the King&#x27;s creation of the Regius Professorships, Smith was made Professor of Law, Cheke Professor of Greek, and John Blythe (of King&#x27;s College) Professor of Physick. Blythe married Alice, one of Cheke&#x27;s sisters, before 1536, and in 1541 William Cecil (afterwards Lord Burleigh), Cheke&#x27;s distinguished student, married Mary Cheke, another. (Mary Cecil died two years later, leaving Cecil with a son, Thomas Cecil.) In 1542 one &quot;Mistress Cheke&quot; was still resident in the Cheke home at Market Hill, Cambridge.

In June 1542, Bishop Gardiner, as chancellor of the university, issued his Edict to all who recognized his authority that the sounds customarily used for the pronunciation of Greek or Latin should not be changed by anyone, and gave a list of them with phonetic explanations. He pronounced severe and potentially exclusionist penalties at all levels of the academic hierarchy for those who contravened this ruling, and further wrote to the vice-chancellor requiring that his edict be observed. Cheke, as one of the principal targets of Gardiner&#x27;s disapproval, entered into a correspondence of seven letters with him, but the Bishop remained inflexible. However the seeds of his method had been sown, and took root. At that time the letters remained unpublished.

In that year Cheke was incorporated M.A. at the University of Oxford, being made a canon of King Henry VIII&#x27;s College. In 1544 he succeeded Smith as Public Orator in the University of Cambridge. Day, consecrated Bishop of Chichester in 1543, remained provost of King&#x27;s. At this time Cheke prepared his Latin translation (dedicated to the King) of the &quot;De Apparatu Bellico&quot; of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI, often sharing and talking over his work with Roger Ascham. Thomas Hoby was then one of his pupils. Cheke&#x27;s reading and thought in the Greek Histories, and his use of them to extract examples of policy and conduct, can be studied in his annotations to print copies (from the Aldine Press) of Herodotus and Thucydides.

In 1543 and 1545, his Latin versions of the homilies of St John Chrysostom were published, opening with a letter of dedication to his patron the King. On 10 June 1544 Cheke was appointed tutor to the future King Edward VI of England, as a supplement to his tutor Dr Richard Cox, to teach him &quot;of toungues, of the scripture, of philosophie and all liberal sciences&quot; (as the Prince wrote in his Journal), and commenced his duties at Hampton Court soon afterwards. At the Prince&#x27;s invitation, the young Henry Hastings shared in his studies. Roger Ascham felt strongly Cheke&#x27;s absence from the university, where his example was so inspirational. Special interest has been found in Cheke&#x27;s lengthy preface to his Latin translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;De Superstitione&quot;, prepared as a New Year&#x27;s gift for the King in 1545 or 1546.

Edward&#x27;s tutor in French, the Huguenot Jean Belmain, was Cheke&#x27;s nephew by marriage. Ascham&#x27;s pupil William Grindal was, at his recommendation to Cheke, chosen to read Greek to Princess Elizabeth, until his untimely death in 1548. By that time William Bill was Master of St John&#x27;s, and John Redman Master of the newly-founded Trinity College (1546), in which Bill succeeded him in 1551.

On 11 May 1547, Cheke married Mary, daughter of Richard Hill (formerly Sergeant of the Wine-cellar to Henry VIII) and now stepdaughter of Sir John Mason. Cheke&#x27;s religious and scholarly purpose bore fruit in the highest quarters. Gerard Langbaine the elder expressed it thus:&quot;under God M. Cheek was a speciall instrument of the propagation of the Gospell, &amp; that Religion which we now professe in this Kingdome. For he not only sowed the seeds of that Doctrine in the heart of Prince EDWARD, which afterwards grew up into a generall Reformation when he came to be King, but by his meanes the same saveing truth was gently instilled into the Lady ELIZABETH, by those who by his procurement were admitted to be the Guides of her younger Studies.&quot;

== Edwardian statesman ==
=== Status and compromise ===

Upon the accession of Edward to the throne Cheke, now Schoolmaster to the King, was made a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, being allowed an annuity of £100 from the Augmentations in August. On 1 October, he was returned to Parliament as a member for Bletchingley, Sussex, probably under the patronage of Sir Thomas Cawarden. He was very soon placed in a compromise by Thomas Seymour (brother of the Duke of Somerset), who had drafted a letter as from the King to the Lords of the Parliament House seeking their approval to separate the offices of Lord Protector and Lord Regent, and to appoint Thomas Seymour himself as Protector. He urged Cheke to pass the letter to the King and to induce him to sign it, which Cheke refused to do, stating that Lord Paget had prohibited any such dealings. At Christmas, Seymour followed this up with a gift of £40 to Cheke, half for himself and half for the King. Seymour approached the King himself without success: Edward took Cheke&#x27;s advice, and refused to sign it.
On 1 April 1548 Cheke was chosen by special mandate of the King, overriding university statutes, to replace his former tutor George Day as provost of King&#x27;s College. He received by purchase a large grant of lands in London and elsewhere, including the site of the former College of St John the Baptist at Stoke-by-Clare in Suffolk, in October 1548. Matthew Parker, its dean, had established a school there, and after its superstitious constitution had been dissolved he advised Cheke on its condition and maintenance.

The Seymour affair came to a head in January 1548/9, when Thomas Seymour was formally charged with using improper means to influence King Edward, and Cheke became implicated as his likely accomplice. On 11 January Cheke came near to losing his office as schoolmaster to the King. Seymour confessed the gift, but on 20 February Cheke exonerated himself by an honest declaration of his dealings in the matter. 
Unfortunately, Mistress Cheke offended the Duchess of Somerset in the course of these proceedings; an apology had to be made. Following Seymour&#x27;s execution in March Cheke retreated to Cambridge for a time, tending his library and readjusting his circumstances, aware that he had come near to losing his position (as his letter to Peter Osborne indicates). Other royal preceptors, Sir Anthony Cooke or Dr. Cox, maintained the young King&#x27;s instruction.

In the Epistle to his &quot;Arte of Logique&quot; (published 1551), Thomas Wilson speaks of Cheke and Cooke as &quot;your Maiesties teachers and Scholemaisters in all good litterature&quot;.

The antiquary Francis Blomefield dates to 1550 Cheke&#x27;s receipt of a 21-year lease of the manor and rectory of Rushworth, Norfolk (a former collegiate estate established by the Gonville family), which he re-leased to his brother-in-law, George Alyngton, of Stoke-by-Clare.

=== Religious reform: friends and rewards ===

In discharge of their Commission, in May–July 1549 the Bishops Goodrich of Ely and Ridley of Rochester, Sir William Paget and Sir Thomas Smith, John Cheke and two others conducted the King&#x27;s Visitation of the University of Cambridge to investigate and amend statutes tending towards ignorance and Romish superstition. William Bill was now Master of St John&#x27;s and vice-chancellor. On 6 May Cheke delivered the King&#x27;s statute before the University Senate. Colleges were visited, complaints were heard, investigated and acted upon; two disputations (20 and 25 June) were held in the Philosophy Schools upon the question of the Real Presence in the Sacrament. Their business concluded, the congress broke up on 8 July.

In that year Cheke published his lasting work &quot;The Hurt of Sedition&quot;, in the aftermath of the suppression of Kett&#x27;s rebellion. This made plain his full commitment to the Edwardian reform and its authority. He was chosen one of 8 divines, among 32 Commissioners, to draw up a reform of laws for the governance of the Church. The Latin form of their report, which Cheke prepared with Walter Haddon, remained long unpublished. He returned to London, giving evidence at the examination of Bishop Bonner in September 1549, and sitting in the Parliamentary third session, towards the close of which he was granted property in Lincolnshire and Suffolk worth £118 a year for his care in the King&#x27;s instruction. In April 1550, following Somerset&#x27;s fall, Cheke was given licence to keep 50 retainers. In May he acquired the manor and town of Dunton Wayletts in Essex, and the manors of Preston and Hoo in Sussex, from John Poynet. He obtained for Roger Ascham the role of secretary to Sir Richard Morison&#x27;s Embassy to Emperor Charles V.
Archbishop Cranmer reputedly told Cheke that he might be glad all the days of his life to have such a scholar as the Prince, &quot;for he hathe more divinitie in his litle fynger, then all we have in al our bodies.&quot; Cheke meanwhile prepared a Latin version of the first Book of Common Prayer, the form in which Peter Martyr read it when consulted over its review by Cranmer. Peter Martyr doubted if the bishops would approve it, but Cheke foreknew the King&#x27;s determination to implement it. In October 1550 his friend Martin Bucer, Cambridge Regius Professor of Divinity (who was indebted to Cheke for some favour offered by the King towards his countryman Johann Sleidan), presented him with the draft manuscript of his &quot;De Regno Christi&quot; (which remained unpublished until 1557).

With Sir Thomas Smith, William Cecil, Sir Anthony Wingfield, Sir Thomas Wroth and Sir Ralph Sadler, Cheke gave evidence at the interrogation and deprivation of Stephen Gardiner in January 1551. At that time he was appointed to a weighty Commission to inquire into, amend and punish heresies, renewed in the following year. Martin Bucer died in February. In May 1551 Cheke&#x27;s annuity was cancelled, and in its place he received an enhanced grant of Stoke-by-Clare with its former lands and dependencies in Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Huntingdon, etc, with other properties, worth £192 per annum, for his industry in teaching the King. He was serving as commissioner for relief in Cambridgeshire, and, having conducted a Visitation of Eton in September, he and his brother-in-law Cecil (now a Secretary of State and chancellor of the Order of the Garter) on 11 October received knighthoods, the day upon which the Earl of Warwick was created Duke of Northumberland, and others of the nobility were advanced.
Shortly thereafter Cheke took part in two important private disputations upon the Real Presence, one at Cecil&#x27;s house and the second at Sir Richard Morison&#x27;s, held as a preparation for the review of the Prayer Book to be conducted in 1552. Among the auditors were Sir Thomas Wroth, Sir Anthony Cooke, Lord Russell and Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and the debate lay between Cheke, Cecil, Edmund Grindal and others, against the presence, and John Feckenham, Dr Yong and others upholding it. The matter of the debates was printed by John Strype. The commission for examination of ecclesiastical laws, as required by Act of Parliament, was issued on 12 February. At this time Cheke, who had the books and papers of Martin Bucer, was attempting to build up the royal Library, and at the death of his friend and admirer John Leland, the antiquary, in April 1552 acquired his materials for the same purpose.

Having suffered a severe inflammation of the lungs in May 1552, he held a further disputation in Cambridge upon the doctrine of the Harrowing of Hell, with Christopher Carlile, before joining a royal progress. In July 1552, he was granted a special licence to shoot at certain fowl and deer with crossbow or hand-gun; in August he was created Chamberlain of the Receipt of the King&#x27;s Exchequer, in the place of Anthony Wingfield, deceased, with a lifetime authority to appoint its officers (he entered office on 12 September 1552), and was also awarded the wardship and marriage of the heir of Sir Thomas Barnardiston.

In mid-September he received from Archbishop Cranmer the Forty-two Articles prepared for the revision of the Prayer-Book with the instruction to discuss them with Cecil and to set them in order. Being approved by the Convocation they were published in 1553: in the same period Cheke had apparently prepared the Latin translation of Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament&quot; of 1550, and this too was published in 1553.

During 1552, he was visited in London by Girolamo Cardano, who lodged with him. Cheke was, like others of his time, somewhat given to judicial astrology. John Dee claimed that Cheke had declared his &#x27;good liking&#x27; of him to William Cecil.

At least two horoscopes of Cheke&#x27;s birth exist, one by Sir Thomas White and one by Cardano. Cardano&#x27;s observations on Cheke were published in his &quot;De Genituris Liber&quot;.

Cheke gave him some exact dates concerning events in his life, and Cardano described him as a slender, manly figure with fine skin of good colour, well-set and sharp eyes, of noble bearing, handsome and hirsute.

=== Apotheosis ===

Cheke was returned again for the Parliament of March 1553, and was at about that time a clerk of the Privy Council. In May 1553 he was further rewarded for his services to the King&#x27;s education both in childhood and in youth, by the grant of the manor of Clare, Suffolk and the fees of various possessions of the Honour of Clare in Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, worth £100 per annum. As the King&#x27;s health declined and the question of succession became imminent, on 2 June 1553 Cheke was sworn as one of the principal Secretaries of State and took his place in the Privy Council. If that had been in anticipation of the resignation of Sir William Petre or Sir William Cecil, in the event neither resigned and there were for that time three Secretaries, all of whom signed the Engagement of the Council written out by Petre to certify the King&#x27;s appointment of the succession, and the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s Letters Patent to that effect, dated 21 June 1553.
In Edward&#x27;s last weeks Sir Thomas Wroth enfeoffed Cheke, and members of his own family, with his estates to the uses of his Wroth descendants, probably anticipating the danger of dispossession.

Roger Ascham wrote from Brussels to congratulate Cheke on future hopes for the King&#x27;s reign, but too late. The King died on 6 July and Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed Queen on the 10th. Cheke remained as her Secretary of State and was loyal to her to the last. The council received a letter from Mary dated 9 July, from Kenninghall in Norfolk, stating her claim to the throne and demanding their loyalty. Sir John Cheke composed the reply of the same date, signed by the Lords of the council, informing her of Jane&#x27;s rightful succession, of the witnessed and sealed deeds declaring the late King&#x27;s will, and of their duty to her. He was present at the proclamation of Queen Mary on 19 July, hours after he had written to Lord Rich on behalf of the council to ensure his loyalty to Jane. He bowed to the inevitable.

Among the numerous arrests which followed, Sir John Cheke and the Duke of Suffolk (Queen Jane&#x27;s father) were taken on 27 or 28 July 1553 and imprisoned in the Tower, articles of indictment being drawn up against him two weeks later. Cranmer, also imprisoned, wrote to Cecil for news of Cheke&#x27;s welfare.

Following the executions of the Duke of Northumberland and Sir John Gates on 22 August, Mary&#x27;s initial response was one of clemency. Cheke was released from the Tower on 13 September 1553. He ceased to be provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. His office in the Exchequer was granted to Robert Strelley in November 1553 and to Henry, Lord Stafford in February 1554. Cheke&#x27;s property was seized, but in the spring of 1554 he was granted licence to go abroad. By the time his pardon for offences before 1 October 1553 was granted, on 28 April 1554, he had already left England.

== Marian exile ==

Travelling under licence in early spring 1554, Cheke took with him Sir Thomas Wroth and Sir Anthony Cooke (who were not under licence), going first in April to Strasbourg and thence to Basel. There he met Caelius Secundus Curio, a distinguished Italian humanist, who had sent books and a greeting to Cheke in 1547. Cheke explained to him his system of Greek pronunciation and entrusted to him the correspondence between himself and Stephen Gardiner on that subject. By July 1554 they were in Italy, where at Padua he gave lectures upon Demosthenes in Greek to English students, met with Sir Thomas Wylson and many others, and entertained Sir Philip Hoby. Wroth, Cheke and Cooke, with their companies, joined with the Hoby party on an excursion to Mantua and Ferrara, returning to Padua in late November.

The following August, the Hobys&#x27; company having proceeded to Caldero beside Verona, Wroth and Cheke joined them there from Padua, avoiding a fresh outbreak of the plague, and they progressed north together through Rovereto, Innsbruck and Munich to Augsburg, where they arrived on 28 August 1555. After this the Hobys went on to Frankfurt, but Wroth and Cheke diverted to Strasbourg, and remained there, Cheke being chosen public Professor of the Greek tongue. During 1555 his correspondence with Bishop Gardiner on the Greek pronunciation was published at Basel by Curio without his knowledge; but not without provocation to Bishop Gardiner, now Lord Chancellor, and to his doctrine. Cheke remained in correspondence with Sir William Cecil at this time. Cheke may also have been in Emden to supervise the publication of his Latin edition of Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s &quot;Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ&quot; and other Reformist publications.

In the spring of 1556 he visited Brussels to make a rendezvous with his wife, and, under promise of safe conduct, to meet with Lord Paget and Sir John Mason, his wife&#x27;s stepfather. In the return journey, between Brussels and Antwerp, he and Sir Peter Carew were seized on 15 May 1556, by order of Philip II of Spain, and returned unceremoniously to England, where they were imprisoned in the Tower. In Cheke&#x27;s words, he was &quot;taken as it were in a whirlwind from the place he was in, and brought over sea, and never knew whither he went till he found himself in the Tower of London.&quot; John Poynet considered that Paget and Mason had treacherously arranged the arrest, causing them to be &quot;taken by the Provost Marshall, spoiled of their horses, and clapt into a cart, their legs, arms, and bodies tyed with halters to the body of the cart, and so carried to the sea-side, and from thence into the Tower of London.&quot;

== Imprisonment, recantation and death ==
Cheke, whose wife was allowed to attend him, was visited by two priests and by Dr John Feckenham, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s, with whom he had formerly disputed. Cheke wrote to the Queen expressing his willingness to obey her laws. Feckenham attempted to intercede for him, but nothing less than a full recantation, in prescribed terms, was acceptable to Mary. The fates of so many, of John Bradford, Rowland Taylor, Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer stood newly before him. In early September 1556 he wrote a submission to the Queen which Her Majesty approved, though he was made to write it out again for having failed to mention King Philip: Feckenham sent him some notes on the real presence. He agreed to be received into the Church of Rome by Cardinal Pole, and, following a public oration by John Feckenham, made his public recantation on 4 October 1556. John Foxe continues:&quot;Then after his recantation, hee was thorough the craftie handlyng of the catholikes, allured first to dine and company with them, at length drawen unwares to sit in place, where the pore Martyrs were brought before Boner and other Bishops to bee condemned, the remorse whereof so mightely wrought in his hart, that not longe after he lefte this mortal life. Whose fall although it was full of infirmitie, yet his rising again by repentaunce was greate, and his ende comfortable, the Lorde bee praised.&quot;
In the wake of his recantation the confiscated freehold properties in the eastern counties granted to him by King Edward VI were restored to him but immediately exchanged for other freehold lands in Suffolk, Devon and Somerset providing for an annual return of almost £250. He surrendered ownership of the Manor of Barnardiston to Queen Mary on 31 May 1557. In July 1557, living at Peter Osborne&#x27;s house in Wood Street (Cheapside), he wrote to Sir Thomas Hoby thanking him for inviting his editorial comments on Hoby&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Courtier&quot; (&quot;Il Cortegiano&quot;) of Baldassare Castiglione, over the Preface to which he had taken some pains. An advocate of English linguistic purism, he remarked &quot;our own tung shold be written cleane and pure, vnmixt and vnmangeled with borowing of other tunges... For then doth our tung naturallie and praisablie vtter her meaning&quot;; and he complimented Hoby on the &#x27;roundness&#x27; of his &#x27;saienges and welspeakinges&#x27;.

His brief will, providing for an annuity of £10 for his son Henry&#x27;s continuing education, making his wife and his friend and kinsman Peter Osborne (husband of Cheke&#x27;s niece Anne Blythe) his executors and his &quot;deerely beloved&quot; Sir John Mason his overseer, was written on 13 September 1557. Mylady Cheke, Mistress Osborne and his son&#x27;s schoolmaster William Irelande (a distinguished early pupil of Roger Ascham&#x27;s) were among the witnesses. He died, aged 43, on the same day, at Osborne&#x27;s house in London, carrying, as Thomas Fuller remarked, &quot;God&#x27;s pardon and all good men&#x27;s pity along with him.&quot; The will was proved on 18 January following. He was buried at St Alban, Wood Street and had a memorial inscription there, written by Walter Haddon, recorded by Gerard Langbaine:

Roger Ascham remembered him as &quot;My dearest frend, and best master that ever I had or heard in learning, Syr I. Cheke, soch a man, as if I should live to see England breed the like againe, I feare, I should live over long...&quot; Thomas Wilson, in the epistle prefixed to his translation of the &quot;Olynthiacs of Demosthenes&quot; (1570), has a long and interesting eulogy of Cheke; and Thomas Nashe, in a preface to Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Menaphon&quot; (1589), called him &quot;the Exchequer of eloquence, Sir John Cheke, a man of men, supernaturally traded in all tongues.&quot; The antiquary John Gough Nichols, who (after John Strype) developed historiographical understanding of Sir John Cheke, called him &quot;in many respects, one of the most interesting personages of the century.&quot;

===Portraits===
A portrait of Sir John Cheke is attributed to Claude Corneille de Lyon. The line engraving attributed to Willem de Passe, published in 1620, might be based on an earlier portrait. The Joseph Nutting engraving published in Strype&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; of 1705 apparently derives from the same source as a later engraving by James Fittler, A.R.A., after a drawing by William Skelton, itself said to be based on an original picture at Ombersley Court, Worcestershire, formerly in possession of the Dowager Marchioness of Devonshire. The portrait formerly in the collection of the Dukes of Manchester at Kimbolton Castle was sold at Christie&#x27;s in 2020.

== Children ==
* Henry Cheke (c. 1548–1586) married first Frances Radclyffe (sister of Edward Radclyffe), by whom he had three sons and two daughters, and second Frances daughter of Marmaduke Constable of York.

<text>Robert Kett () was the leader of Kett&#x27;s Rebellion.

Kett was the fourth son of Thomas Kett, of Forncett, Norfolk and his wife Margery. He is thought to have been a tanner, but he certainly held the manor of Wymondham in Norfolk. With his brother William he led the men of Wymondham in their quarrel with John Flowerdew, the father of Edward Flowerdew. They tore down the enclosure fences Flowerdew had erected on the Hethersett common, and having thus come into prominence, he headed the men of Norfolk when they rose in rebellion in 1549 owing to the hardships inflicted by the extensive enclosures of common lands and by the general policy of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, then Lord Protector. A feast held at Wymondham in July 1549 developed into a riot and gave the signal for the outbreak. Leading his followers to Norwich, Kett formed a camp on Mousehold Heath, where he is said to have commanded 16,000 men, introduced a regular system of discipline, administered justice and blockaded the region. The 29 clauses of the Petition survives and the petition is below. It is notable in reflecting the language of the new religion, in line with the Lord Protector&#x27;s inclinations; and in its carefully diplomatic format of requesting changes. Broadly speaking, the clauses seek:
* To limit the power of the gentry
* To restrain rapid economic change
* Prevent the over use of communal resources
* And remodel the values of the clergy, echoing Somerset&#x27;s religious radicalism
#We pray your grace that where it is enacted for enclosing that it be not hurtful to such as have enclosed saffron grounds for they be greatly chargeable to them, and that from henceforth no man shall enclose any more.
#We certify your grace that whereas the lords of the manors have been charged with certain free rent, the same lords have sought means to charge the freeholders to pay the same rent, contrary to right.
#We pray your grace that no lord of no manor shall common upon the common.
#We pray that priests from henceforth shall purchase no lands neither free nor bond, and the lands that they have in possession may be letten to temporal men, as they were in the first year of the reign of King Henry VII.
#We pray that all the marshes that are held of the king’s majesty by free rent or of any other, may be at such price as they were in the first year of King Henry VII.
#We pray that reed ground and meadow ground may be at such price as they were in the first year of King Henry VII.
#We pray that all bushels within your realm be of one stice, that is to say, to be in measure VIII gallons.
#We pray that priests or vicars that be not able to preach and set forth the word of God to his parishioners may be thereby put from his benefice, and the parishioners there to choose another or else patron or lord of the town.
#We pray that the payments of castle ward rent, blanch farm, and office lands, which hath been accustomed to be gathered of the tenements, whereas we suppose the lords ought to pay the same to their bailiffs for their rents gathering, and not the tenants.
#We pray that no man under the degree of a knight or esquire keep a dove house, except it hath been of an old ancient custom.
#We pray that all freeholders and copyholders may take the profits of all commons, and there to common, and the lords not to common nor take profits of the same.
#We pray that no feodary within your shores shall be a counselor to any man in his office making, whereby the king may be truly served, so that a man being of good conscience may be yearly chosen to the same office by the commons of the same shire.
#We pray your grace to take all liberty of leet your own hands whereby all men may quietly enjoy their commons with all profits.
#We pray that copyhold land that is unreasonable rented may go as it did in the first year of King Henry VII. And that at the death of a tenant, or of a sale the same lands to be charged with an easy fine as a capon or a reasonable sum of money for a remembrance.
# We pray that no priest shall hold no other office to any man of honour or worship, but only to be resident upon their benefices, whereby their parishioners may be instructed within the laws of God.
#We pray that all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious bloodshedding.
#We pray that Rivers may be free and common to all men for fishing and passage.
#We pray that no man shall be put by your Feudatory to find any office, unless he holdeth of your grace in chief, or capite above 10 by year.
#We pray that the poor mariners or fishermen may have the whole profits of their fishings such as porpoises, grampuses, whales, or any great fish so it be not prejudicial to your grace.
#We pray that every proprietary parson or vicar having a benefice of 10 or more by year, shall either by themselves, or by some other person teach poor men’s children of their parish the book called the catechism and the primer.
#We pray that it be not lawful to the lords of any manor to purchase lands freely, (i.e. that are freehold), and to let them out again by copy or court roll to their great advancement, and to the undoing of your poor subjects.
#We pray that no proprietary parson or vicar, in consideration of avoiding trouble and lawsuit between them and their poor parishioners, which they daily do proceed and attempt, shall from henceforth take for the full contents of all the tenths which now they do receive, but 8.
#We pray that no lord, knight, esquire, nor gentlemen do graze nor feed any bullocks or sheep if he may spend forty pounds a year by his lands but only for the provision of his house.
#We pray that no man under the degree of [word missing] shall keep any conies upon any freehold or copyhold unless he pale them in so that it shall not be to the commons’ annoyance.
#We pray that no person of what estate degree or condition he be shall from henceforth sell the awardship of any child, but that the same child if he live to his full age shall be at his own choosing concerning his marriage the King’s wards only except.
# We pray that no manner of person having a manor of his own, shall be no other lord’s bailiff but only his own.
#We pray that no lord, knight, or gentleman shall have or take in form any spiritual promotion.
#We pray your grace to give license and authority by your gracious commission under your great seal to such commissioners as your poor commons have chosen, or to as many of them as your majesty and your counsel shall appoint and think meet, for to redress and reform all such good laws, statues, proclamations and all other your proceedings; which hath been hidden by your Justices of your peace, Sheriff, Feudatories, and other your officers, from your poor commons, since the first year of the reign of your noble grandfather King Henry VII.
#We pray that those your officers, which have offended your grace and your commons, and [are] so proved by the complaint of your poor commons, do give unto these poor men so assembled 4d. every day so long as they have remained there.

He refused the royal offer of an amnesty on the grounds that innocent and just men had no need of pardon, and on 1 August 1549 attacked and took possession of Norwich. John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, marched against the rebels, and after his offer of pardon had been rejected he forced his way into the city, driving its defenders before him. Then, strengthened by the arrival of some foreign mercenaries, he attacked the main body of the rebels at Dussindale on 27 August. Although Kett&#x27;s men were faced with a trained soldiery, the battle saw fierce fighting and lasted most of the day: but Kett&#x27;s men were ultimately defeated and Robert and William Kett were seized and taken to London, where they were condemned to death for treason. On 7 December 1549 Robert was executed at Norwich, and his body was hanged on the top of the castle, while that of William was hanged on the church tower at Wymondham. The Kett line still survives to this day.

<doc id="264787" wikidata="Q2299256" url="?curid=264787" title="Solomon Stoddard">
<text>Solomon Stoddard (September 27, 1643, baptized October 1, 1643 – February 11, 1729) was the pastor of the First Church of Christ in Northampton, Massachusetts Bay Colony. He succeeded Rev. Eleazer Mather, and later married his widow around 1670. Stoddard significantly liberalized church policy while promoting more power for the clergy, decrying drinking and extravagance, and urging the preaching of hellfire and the Judgment. The major religious leader of what was then the frontier, he was known as the &quot;Puritan Pope of the Connecticut River valley&quot; and was concerned with the lives (and the souls) of second-generation Puritans. The well-known theologian Jonathan Edwards (1703–1758) was his grandson, the son of Solomon&#x27;s daughter, Esther Stoddard Edwards. Stoddard was the first librarian at Harvard University and the first person in American history known by that title.

==Religious leader==
Stoddard was an influential religious leader in colonial New England, and was the grandfather of the prominent theologian Rev. Jonathan Edwards.

For 55 years, Stoddard occupied an unparalleled position in the Connecticut River Valley region of Massachusetts. His theology was not widely accepted in Boston, but was popular on the frontier. Opponents sometimes referred to him as &quot;Pope&quot; Stoddard, rhetorically placing him in the locally detested camp of the Roman Catholic Church. Yet what started as an insult from Increase Mather changed as his presbyterian influences over Congregational church government grew. Stoddard insisted that the sacrament of the Lord&#x27;s Supper should be available to all who lived outwardly pious lives and had a good reputation in the community, even if they weren&#x27;t full members of the church. This was his attempt to save his church from a &quot;dying religion&quot;, and was the cause of great theological controversy in 18th century New England (see also Halfway Covenant).

Although in acknowledging his grandfather as a &quot;sort of deity&quot;, Edwards minimised his influence over Northampton, being dismissive of the oracle who had caused great wounds and split the church. Nevertheless, years later Timothy Dwight would assess his impact as more profound than any other clergyman over a thirty-year period.

==Early life==
Stoddard was born in Boston on September 26, 1643, to Anthony Stoddard, a wealthy Boston merchant, and Mary Downing (sister of Sir George Downing (after whom Downing Street in London is named), niece to Governor John Winthrop). He was baptized on October 1 at the First Church, Boston. As such, he was born into the highest stratum of aristocratic New England, but his mother died suddenly in June 1647, when he was still an infant.

He attended Cambridge Grammar School, probably the best one in New England &quot;to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for Universities&quot;, &quot;under the most reputable&quot; Elijah Corlet, Oxon MA.

Going up in 1658 he aimed to &quot;lead an honest, sober and Godly life,&quot; permitted to speak only Latin, &quot;diligently avoid being inoffensive in word or gesture.&quot; In the rigid disciplinary world of the Puritan Theocracy, alcohol was forbidden, except for a weak beer, as was tobacco. The &quot;poenal laws&quot; included expulsion for blasphemy and &quot;prophanation of the Lords Day Ordinances&quot;. He graduated BA from this &quot;elite gathering&quot; at Harvard College in July 1662. The MA during the next three years was &#x27;Puritan casuistry&#x27; becoming an expert in a systematic study of theology adhering to the fundamentals of Holy Scripture. Rational theology was not pure Calvinism, but divined from Covenant; it resembled philosophy, offering a distilled thesis of disputation.

A Fellow and Tutor of Harvard Corporation for a year, he was then chosen in March 1667, to be the &quot;first American librarian known to history by that title&quot; when he was appointed &quot;Library keeper&quot;, and Library Laws were enacted specifying that he should keep the Library &quot;duly swept&quot; and the books &quot;clean and orderly.&quot; The following is found in the records of Harvard College:

March 27, 1667, &quot;Mr Solomon Stoddard was chosen Library keeper.&quot; &quot;For the rectifying of ye Library &amp; Rules for the Library Keeper&quot;, sixteen &quot;orders were made.&quot; &quot;No person resident in the College, except an Overseer&quot;, and &quot;no Schollar in the College, under a Senior&quot;, could borrow a book, and &quot;no one under master of Art (unless it be a fellow) ... without the allowance of the President.&quot;

It was there that he studied the British Presbyterian history with a maverick perspective on order from chaos. To improve his health, Stoddard went to Barbados and served as a chaplain to Governor Daniel Searle from 1667 to 1669. But he soon felt the need to return to New England. As he prepared to depart from Boston for a position in England, he received a call from Northampton Church to stand in for the recently deceased Eleazar Mather, brother of Increase Mather. He accepted the offer, and relocated to Northampton, which in 1670 was on the frontier. Within a few months, Stoddard had married Mather&#x27;s widow Esther (née Esther, daughter of Rev. John Warham, of Windsor, CT; - February 10, 1736), moved into his house, and took over his pulpit to become Northampton&#x27;s second minister. He held the post for 55 years, during which time he and Esther produced thirteen children: John, Solomon, Samuel, Solomon, Anthony (d.infant), Anthony, Aaron, Israel, Mary, Christian, Sarah, Esther, Hannah. 
Stoddard was pastor of a group ministry of churches at Dorchester, Roxbury, and Springfield as well as Northampton, purchased from the Indians in 1653.
Although well versed in the Latin and Hebrew of the Boston Puritan elite, he preferred to use the common language of the frontier in his sermons. A sense of the frontier life may be gleaned from his proposal in 1703 to use dogs &quot;to hunt Indians as they do Bears&quot;, the argument being that dogs would catch many an Indian who would be too light of foot for the townsmen. This was not considered inhumane, for the Indians, in Stoddard&#x27;s view, &quot;act like wolves and are to be dealt with as wolves.&quot; Three years later. Massachusetts passed an act for the raising of dogs to better secure the frontier borders.

==Half-way Covenant==
Stoddard is credited with propounding the &quot;Half-way Covenant&quot;, at Northampton on 18 April 1661. while young Elezear Mather was the pastor. It represented a reaffirmation of the Communion rules that accompanied a decline of piety in the Congregational church. Stoddard&#x27;s interest was to insure the growth of church congregations in a colony of second-generation pilgrims who were increasingly interested in the political and economic life of the frontier, as opposed to the pure idealism of their immigrant parents. Stoddard taught that people who had grown up in the church and were not scandalous in behavior could receive communion as a means of grace; and have their children baptized, despite the fact that the Puritan tradition had previously required prospective members of the church to proclaim a spiritual &quot;conversion&quot;. Eleazer Mather opposed the Covenant as contrariwise to the Cambridge Platform of 1648, voted against the innovations of Synod of 1662. When in 1669, Mather died, the Northampton Church declared: &quot;to rest contented with that share and portion of privilege belonging to them that are only in a state of Education in Christ&#x27;s House...and have their children baptized.&quot; That was the position when Stoddard took over the congregation. At a meeting on August 1670, Solomon was promised 20 acres of land, but then offered £100 instead. And eventually setting on four acres to build a house, to be funded by a Ministers Rate of 2s 6d.
Stoddard was ordained as pastor of Northampton on the strength of a Letter of Recommendation (Feb 7, 1672) from Rev John Strong, regional convenor of the Congregational Church in neighbouring towns of Massachusetts and Connecticut. Subscribing to the Doctrine of Faith, the Half-Way Covenant was put in place was an essential prerequisite to installment. Mather&#x27;s orthodox Puritanism had witnessed declining numbers, yet Stoddard was able to revitalise the church through liberal reforms.

The Northampton Church was in danger of extinction unless additional members were admitted on a &quot;half-way&quot; basis, explains Harry Swanhart. Stoddard&#x27;s decision to admit all but the &quot;scandalous&quot; to the church attracted the ire and rancour of the Mathers from the Massachusetts Bay area. For his case, Stoddard turned to the Northampton Town Meeting, abandoning the old Theocracy, but making the &quot;communion of saints&quot; subject to civilian political control. In September 1675, he implored Increase Mather to speak with the Governor to &quot;care for a Reformation...especially mention oppression, that Intollerable Pride in Cloathes and hair, the tolleration of so many taverns, especially in Boston,&quot; he wrote from Northampton. Mather eventually came to realise that children were being left without discipline, and so it was axiomatic to support the Synod &quot;to bring them under the yoke of Christ,&quot; even if it proved an impossibility.

==Congregationalism and Stoddard==
Stoddard&#x27;s Congregationalism would &quot;Whole-way ruin all in a little time&quot;, admonished Mather in &quot;The Danger of Apostacy&quot;. In theology, Stoddard contradicted nearly every standard belief of his Puritan colleagues. Puritan theology at the time stressed a strict doctrine of salvation by repentance. Stoddard believed that everyone should experience God&#x27;s glory for himself, whether through Nature or Scripture. When one sees this glory for himself, Stoddard preached that one&#x27;s will is automatically affected. He explained that &quot;the gloriousness of God has a commanding power on the heart&quot;. Membership without conversion should come experientially rather than through any set process or education. Mather countered this belief by stating that, although a Harvard education may assist in the pulpit on Sunday mornings, the sermon is useless unless the minister has experienced God&#x27;s saving grace.

Stoddard&#x27;s concepts of theology were not widely accepted either by fellow clergy or laymen in New England. As he believed the ministry was key to bringing people closer to the Lord God Almighty, his main goal was conversion of the hearts of sinners. The only source of salvation was God&#x27;s Word, especially as related through the sermon. If a community continued to remain unconverted, then either the preacher himself was unconverted, or he needed to modify his sermons to better address the unconverted. This called for a revision in church policy.

&quot;We fear the dangers ahead&quot;, averred Edward Taylor of Westfield, whose group, jealous of the improving church-going numbers in Northampton recommended a plan for the adoption of a &quot;Church State.&quot; Stoddard called presbyterian like councils to discuss and debate innovations in policy: he wanted to develop the &quot;Instituted Church&quot; in order to preserve purity among ministers. Each church would be instructed through a national church, which determined the proper qualifications for ministers. The redemption of the sinner&#x27;s soul was to be the evangelical purpose of this church. His ideas, at least in this respect, gained few adherents. Stoddard&#x27;s position was expressed through debates with his in-laws Cotton and Increase Mather. As leader of one of Boston&#x27;s primary churches, Cotton Mather wielded influence during Stoddard&#x27;s lifetime. Mather&#x27;s arguments could not hold sway: Congregationalism eventually adopted Stoddard&#x27;s stance on communion, despite initial fears of &quot;New England&#x27;s apostasy.&quot;

Mather remained a formidable opponent. Another contrast between Stoddard and the other Puritan leaders of his time was his belief in the strict dichotomy between the converted (or regenerate) and the unconverted. Stoddard rejected the Puritan claim that no one could discern whether he was saved. Like his own conversion experience, he believed that a person would know when he had been converted, because predestination elected whom God saved and those who were unregenerate. This belief led to the communion controversy: Because of his conversion experience, Solomon stressed the importance of an open communion which would be used as a converting ordinance. In 1677 all members of the community who were instructed in Christian doctrine, made a public profession of faith; and living decent lives, could participate in communion. Stoddard explained that there was no biblical justification for allowing only sinners to take communion.

==Businessman and administrator==
During King Philip&#x27;s War Stoddard, already a man of stature in his community, played an outstanding part in organizing defence against the Indian invasions that fell on the townspeople &quot;like wolves and are to be dealt withall as wolves&quot;. Later at the ambush of Dewey&#x27;s Hole, Stoddard was almost killed by Indians. The effect was that he began his pastorate feeling all hostiles should be hunted down and killed. But by 1723 he had undergone a complete transformation, becoming the Indians greatest defender, advocating their conversion to Christianity. In the civil world he maintained a good personal friendship with Judge Samuel Sewall, one of Boston&#x27;s eminent men. He informed the Governor Gurdon Saltonstall of &quot;this Excellent Divine, respecting the Indians.&quot; &quot;I congratulate&quot;, Sewall told his friend, &quot;the unparalleled constancy of Serviceableness, which God has honoured you...&quot;

In 1701 his step-daughter Eunice Mather was carried off and never seen again. This event had a profound impact upon such a religious man. He wrote copiously to Increase Mather and the Governor warning of impending doom &quot;for our preservation...that which the Lord ad delivered.&quot; Stoddard was a major contributor to the definitive history of the events: &quot;A Briefe History of the War with the Indians in New England&quot;. he rose to be assumed the public spokesman of his community to Boston. He proposed road-building to improve trade. In 1700 he managed to transfer the ownership of lands to the Township of Northampton, which was granted by petition in 1701.

==Stoddard&#x27;s Ecclesiology==
Raised in an orthodox Reformed context, today Stoddard is remembered mostly for his introduction of the Halfway Covenant in Northampton. By the mid-seventeenth century Puritan New England&#x27;s first American-born children had come of age, but most children of this second generation were not presenting themselves for full membership in the church. Stoddard introduced the practice of &quot;halfway covenanting&quot; or &quot;owning the covenant&quot; in the Northampton church, which permitted adult children who had not formally joined the church to become &quot;halfway members.&quot; Halfway membership made it possible to affiliate more closely with the church without making a public statement of faith and conversion. The objective of the practice was to allow the adult children of the first generation of settlers, who were committed to Christianity but unsure of their own conversions, to bring their own young children for baptism in the church. Puritans typically reserved the sacrament of baptism only for adult converts and the children of full members.

==Later years==
Stoddard&#x27;s change in the sacraments produced little increase in the number of communicants. Nevertheless, he was able to propose two motions to the Northampton Church in 1690: first, to abolish the public profession of faith and second, to appoint the Lord&#x27;s Supper as a converting ordinance. The first passed by a majority and as a result the population of Northampton doubled from 500 to 1000 in twenty years. The second motion was opposed by the elders of the church, the motion was denied, although the younger people supported it. In 1725, his congregation decided to bring in an assistant, choosing his grandson Jonathan Edwards. Stoddard had a major influence on his grandson and was succeeded by him as the pastor of the church at Northampton. Edwards later repudiated his views, becoming the most famous and fiery orator of the Great Awakening of 1735-1745. The Great Awakening was to some extent a reaction to the failure of &quot;The Halfway Covenant&quot; to strengthen the church. But Stoddard&#x27;s influence persisted in Northampton. Edwards&#x27; views eventually displeased his parishioners, and he was dismissed from the pulpit.

Stoddard may have been too liberal for his grandson Jonathan Edwards, but he was lampooned for prudishness concerning petticoats in an anonymous pamphlet attributed to Benjamin Franklin. Stoddard published a pamphlet in 1722 entitled &quot;Answer to Some Cases of Conscience&quot; in which he argued that the newly fashionable hoop petticoats were &quot;Contrary to the Light of Nature&quot; and that &quot;Hooped Petticoats have something of Nakedness&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s satirical response was entitled &quot;Hoop-Petticoats Arraigned and Condemned, by the Light of Nature, and Law of God&quot;.

Ultimately, Stoddard&#x27;s power seems to derive more from his personality, political influence, and preaching ability, than from the force of his ideas. One man describes Stoddard with a poem:

<doc id="264788" wikidata="Q1200062" url="?curid=264788" title="Horizon Air">
<text>Horizon Air is an American regional airline headquartered in SeaTac, Washington, within the Seattle metropolitan area. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Alaska Air Group and it is paid by fellow group member Alaska Airlines to staff, operate, and maintain aircraft used on flights that are scheduled, marketed, and sold by Alaska Airlines. Planes operated by Horizon are co-branded as to differentiate Horizon&#x27;s planes from those operated by Alaska&#x27;s other regional airline partner, SkyWest Airlines.

Horizon Air started operations in September 1981, was purchased by the Alaska Air Group in November 1986, and continued to fly as a separately branded airline until 2011, when it shifted to the current capacity purchase agreement business model.

The airline is headquartered in the Seattle suburb of SeaTac, not far from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and the airline&#x27;s primary maintenance base is at Portland International Airport. Horizon also considers Seattle–Tacoma and Portland airports its hubs.

== History ==

Horizon Air was formed in May 1981 by Milt Kuolt, Joe Clark, and Bruce McCaw, with initial plans to fly to Hawaii but later changed to serve Washington state. The airline started operations on September 1, 1981, with three Fairchild F-27 aircraft. Its headquarters were in an area that is now within SeaTac, Washington.

Horizon Air&#x27;s first route connected Yakima to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and was followed a week later by Tri-Cities Airport in Pasco to Seattle. The general offices of Horizon Air were operated out of an old house behind Sea-Tac Airport. Horizon acquired Air Oregon on June 17, 1982, after both airlines were losing hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly, in order to consolidate and reduce their operating deficit. Horizon agreed to purchase Transwestern Airlines of Utah in September 1983, once again to try to reduce operating deficit of the airline.
A single Fokker F28 twin jet, purchased in July 1984 from an African carrier, was the first jet owned by Horizon Air (however, the first jet operated by Horizon was a wet leased Douglas DC-9-10).

An initial public offering occurred in 1985 to secure operating capital, which after only one profitable year since founding, was needed to keep the airline afloat. That summer, Horizon entered into its first codeshare agreement with United Airlines, and on September 8, Horizon signed an agreement with de Havilland Canada to begin purchasing the airline&#x27;s first brand new aircraft, the de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 twin turboprop.

Late in 1985, Horizon entered into an agreement to purchase their chief competitor in Washington, Cascade Airways, but by early 1986 were released from the agreement. Merger talks between the two had begun in late 1982.

In January 1986, the airline became an international carrier when it began service to Calgary, Alberta, in association with Cascade Airways.

=== Acquisition ===
Alaska Airlines struck a deal to acquire Horizon Air in November 1986. The year before, Alaska had undergone a major corporate restructuring with the airline now being owned by the Alaska Air Group, an airline holding company. Under the agreement, the Alaska Air Group became the owner of Horizon Air after approval by the Transportation Department in late December. The Alaska Air Group continued to operate Horizon as a separately branded airline, with a codesharing agreement with its new sister airline, Alaska, while ending its codeshare with United Airlines.

In 1988, Horizon signed a code share agreement with Northwest Airlines.

International service was expanded in May 1989 with flights to Vancouver and Victoria in British Columbia, using both Dash 8-100 and Fairchild Metroliner turboprop aircraft.

Horizon was the launch customer for the Dornier 328 turboprop, intending to replace the Metroliners with this new aircraft which promised speed and comfort on par with jetliners. In recognition of the order, Dornier painted its second prototype of the 328 in Horizon colors. Twelve aircraft were delivered between November 1993 and November 1995, but they were quickly phased out in late 1997, along with the remaining Metroliners, in favor of fleet standardization to the Dash 8 series of turboprops.

Throughout its history, Horizon has either operated as a standalone carrier or as a regional affiliate of Alaska Airlines, except between 2004 and 2007 when it operated Bombardier CRJ700 aircraft on behalf of Frontier Airlines.

=== Brand phase-out ===

In late 2010, Horizon&#x27;s parent company, the Alaska Air Group, made the decision to no longer operate Horizon as a separate regional airline. Starting on January 1, 2011, Horizon shifted to a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) business model, which had by that time become the regional airline industry standard. Under the CPA, Horizon operates and maintains its aircraft, while Alaska Airlines is responsible for scheduling, marketing and pricing all flights. As part of the change to the new business model, the Horizon Air brand was retired and all Horizon planes were repainted with a co-branded &quot;Alaska &quot; livery.

Alaska Airlines entered into a similar capacity purchase agreement with SkyWest Airlines in May 2011. As part of the agreement, Alaska Air Group managers agreed to sell Horizon&#x27;s fleet of five Bombardier CRJ700 regional jet aircraft to SkyWest, which used the aircraft to operate six West Coast routes as &quot;Alaska &quot;. The move left Horizon with a fleet consisting of a single type of aircraft; the Bombardier Q400 turboprop.
Horizon announced in April 2016 that it would expand its fleet and once again operate regional jets, placing an order for 30 Embraer 175 airplanes.

The airline experienced a period of turmoil in 2017. Amid unprecedented growth (spurred by the addition of the new aircraft), Horizon experienced a severe pilot shortage, forcing the airline to cancel hundreds of flights and delay delivery of new aircraft. The pilot shortage was part of a broader problem affecting all regional airlines, but hit Horizon particularly hard. After the airline industry started to rebound in 2013 after a decade long downturn, mainline air carriers started to hire pilots, mostly from regional carriers which offer low wages and limited opportunities for advancement. More experienced regional carrier pilots moved to higher paying mainlines. Horizon responded with drastically increased pay for flight crews and worked with Alaska, its sister airline, to create more opportunities for advancement. As a result, there is an influx of new, young pilots with less experience.

In response to the crisis, Alaska shifted some of its flights from Horizon to its other regional partner, SkyWest Airlines. It was a move that Horizon&#x27;s CEO described as &quot;disheartening.&quot; Because of the shift, SkyWest ordered additional Embraer 175 airplanes that it will fly for Alaska.

At the end of the troubled year, Horizon&#x27;s CEO Dave Campbell announced that he would step down effective January 5, 2018, for personal reasons. Gary Beck became CEO in January 2018. In November 2019, former retiree of the company Joe Sprague returned to Horizon Air as president.

== Destinations ==

Horizon&#x27;s 45 destinations are located in the U.S. states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington as well as the Canadian provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.

== Fleet ==
=== Current fleet ===

, Horizon Air operates the following aircraft:
The Embraer 175 is a regional jet operated in a three-class configuration (first class, premium class, and main cabin) with a total of 76 all leather, reclining seats. The premium class and main cabin sections of the aircraft have two seats either side of the aisle, while the first class section has a single seat on one side of the aisle and two seats on the other.

===Former fleet===
Horizon Air has previously operated the following aircraft:


=== Aircraft livery ===
At the start of the carrier, Horizon livery had a painted sunrise with a small beach with capitalized words saying &quot;Horizon&quot;. Until 2011, the Horizon Air livery was very similar to that of its parent, Alaska Airlines, except for a dark red (rather than blue) cheatline, and the tail featured a stylized sunset logo, rather than an Eskimo. Two E175s are currently painted in special liveries. Some Dash 8-100s and Q200s (no longer in service with Horizon Air) had names of various destinations preceded by &quot;Great City of&quot; or &quot;Great Cities of&quot; printed on the front of the airplane. The first Dash 8-100, N811PH was dedicated as the &quot;Great Cities of Seattle/Tacoma&quot; and the second airplane, N812PH was the &quot;Great City of Portland&quot;. N824PH was dedicated as the &quot;Great Cities of Pullman/Moscow&quot; on one side and the &quot;Great Cities of Moscow/Pullman&quot; on the other side. N363PH (Q200) was the first airplane to incorporate the &quot;deep bing cherry red&quot; on the underside of the engine nacelle. This became the standard for Horizon&#x27;s brand livery as well as the current Alaska Airlines livery. Prior to this change, the underside of the nacelle was painted &quot;Horizon White&quot;.

On January 25, 2011, Horizon Air announced it was retiring its public brand and adopting the trademark Eskimo of its sister company, Alaska Airlines, on its fleet. Horizon&#x27;s Bombardier Q400 fleet was repainted with a new scheme prominently featuring &quot;Alaska&quot; across the fuselage and the Eskimo on the tail. The planes continue to include a small Horizon logo on the sides of the aircraft, which now appears in Alaska&#x27;s dark blue color.

On March 5, 2019, Horizon introduced a themed livery in celebration of Horizon&#x27;s heritage. Bombardier Q400 #N421QX featured stripes down the side in the traditional Horizon colors and the sunset logo on the tail. The aircraft made its inaugural flight from Yakima to Seattle, the route of Horizon&#x27;s first ever flight.

== Services ==
=== On-board meals and beverages ===
Flight time permitting, passengers in the main cabin are offered a complimentary small snack (cookie, nuts or a snack mix) and a beverage.

Horizon, like its parent airline Alaska, focuses on serving and selling items produced on and inspired by the West Coast. Coffee from Portland-based Stumptown Coffee Roasters is served on all flights.

Horizon&#x27;s aircraft are equipped with a First Class cabin and Premium Class cabin and offer a similar onboard experience to that of Alaska, with complimentary meals in First Class and complimentary alcoholic beverages in both classes.

=== On-board Internet access ===
Horizon&#x27;s aircraft are equipped with an in-flight Wi-Fi and streaming entertainment system. Alaska and Horizon use Gogo Inflight Internet, a land-based internet service, covering all routes served by the airline. The service is fee-based for all passengers, depending on the length of the flight.

== Flight accidents and incidents ==
* On May 2, 1986, a Fairchild Metroliner was hijacked over Oregon, between Eugene and Portland. The pilot convinced the hijacker to allow the plane to stop in Hillsboro to refuel and even let the pilot off the plane, who then called the FBI.
* On April 15, 1988, Flight 2658, a Dash 8-100 (N819PH – &quot;Great City of Sun Valley&quot;), en route from Seattle to Spokane with 37 passengers and 3 crew members, crashed after attempting an emergency landing at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac). The number two (right side/starboard) engine caught fire (due to a manufacturing defect) after take-off from Seattle. Loss of hydraulic pressure due to the fire caused the aircraft to veer off the runway, across the grass, across Taxiway B, and crashed into the B7 and B9 jetways, destroying the plane. There were four serious injuries but no fatalities.
* On May 23, 1990, a Fairchild Metroliner III on a flight from Portland to Seattle suffered a window blowout at above Olympia. The flight made an emergency descent and landing to its planned destination of Sea-Tac Airport. The passenger seated next to the window, who was partially sucked out of the plane for a brief period, was taken to a local hospital where he was treated for his injuries and released.
* On August 10, 2018, a Horizon Air Bombardier Q400 aircraft registered N449QX was stolen from Seattle–Tacoma International Airport by Richard Russell, a ground service agent for Horizon. The incident prompted F-15 fighter jets to scramble and intercept the aircraft. After being in contact with air traffic control for over an hour, the aircraft crashed on Ketron Island in Pierce County, Washington, killing Russell, the only person on the aircraft.
* On October 22, 2023, Flight 2059 was operating from Paine Field in Everett, Washington to San Francisco International Airport when an off-duty pilot sitting in the jumpseat inside the flight deck, Joe Emerson, reportedly tried to pull both engine fire extinguisher handles on the overhead panel. The Embraer 175 aircraft was operating at 31,000 feet at the time, and if Emerson was successful at activating the fire extinguishers, both engines would have shut down. The crew was able to subdue him and land at the Portland International Airport in Oregon, where Emerson was arrested and later charged with 83 counts of attempted murder.

== Lawsuits ==
In November 2023, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Horizon and Alaska Airlines on behalf of the passengers on board Flight 2059, alleging that the passengers&#x27; lives were put at risk by an off-duty pilot who was allowed to ride in the cockpit and who attempted to shut off the engines during flight on October 22, 2023, and seeking an injunction that would require the airlines to &quot;conduct reasonable examinations&quot; of all employees with access to the cockpit immediately prior to boarding.

In July 2024, Horizon was sued by a flight attendant for the airline, who alleged that she was &quot;repeatedly and severely&quot; sexually harassed by two Horizon pilots from September 2023 through February of 2024 and that Horizon&#x27;s human resources department &quot;took no action&quot; to protect her.

<text>Cornelia Hoogland is a Canadian poet, playwright and retired professor. She lived on Hornby Island, British Columbia, Canada, but until 2011 divided her time between London, Ontario as well, where she was a professor at the University of Western Ontario. Hoogland has performed and worked internationally in the areas of poetry and theatre. In 2004, she founded and was the director until 2011 of Antler River Poetry (formerly Poetry London), a poetry reading and workshop series.

== Works ==

=== Poetry ===
&quot;Woods Wolf Girl&quot; (Wolsak and Wynn, 2011) is Hoogland&#x27;s 6th book of poetry, and is based on the fairy tale, Red Riding Hood. &quot;Crow&quot; (Black Moss Press), was also released in 2011. Her 2012 chapbook, &quot;Gravelly Bay&quot; (Alfred Gustav Press, 2012), is set at the ferry terminal on Denman Island. In 2017, her poem &quot;Tourists Stroll a Victoria Waterway&quot; was one of five poems named to the shortlist of the CBC Poetry Prize. Hoogland was a 2020/2021 featured poet as a part of Books BC&#x27;s Poetry in Transit, which displays work by British Columbian poets on TransLink and BC Transit vehicles. The featured poem was &quot;P&#x27;i, Standstill&quot; from her collection &quot;Cosmic Bowling&quot;. 

=== Theater ===
Hoogland adapted &quot;Woods Wolf Girl&quot; for stage as &quot;Faim de Loup&quot;, which was dramaturged by Gil Garret and Susan Ferley and included in the 2012 PlayWrights Cabaret at the Grand Theatre in London, ON. &quot;Faim de Loup&quot; was selected for inclusion in the 2012 Women Playwrights International Conference, and performed as &quot;Talking in Bed.&quot; 

Hoogland&#x27;s play, &quot;Country of my Skin&quot; won the Adjudicators&#x27; Choice Award at the London One-Act Festival in 2004, Lesleigh Turner, Director. Janice Johnston directed the same play for In Good Company at the Aeolian Hall in October 2006 and in November 2006 &quot;Country&quot; traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, to the Women Playwrights International conference. Her published play for children – &quot;Salmonberry: A West Coast Fairy Tale&quot; (&quot;International Plays for Young Audiences&quot;, Meriwether, 2000) – was performed at the 1999 International Women Playwrights Conference in Athens.

<text>The Pomo are a Native American people of California. Historical Pomo territory in Northern California was large, bordered by the Pacific Coast to the west, extending inland to Clear Lake, mainly between Cleone and Duncans Point. One small group, the Tceefoka (Northeastern Pomo), lived in the vicinity of present-day Stonyford, Colusa County, where they were separated from the majority of Pomo lands by Yuki and Wintuan speakers.

The name &quot;Pomo&quot; derives from a conflation of the Pomo words and . It originally meant &quot;those who live at red earth hole&quot; and was once the name of a village in southern Potter Valley, near the present-day community of Pomo, Mendocino County. The word may also have referred to the local deposits of red magnesite (mined and utilized for making red beads) or to the reddish, earthen clay soil of the area, rich in hematite (also mined for use). In the Northern Pomo dialect, &quot;-pomo&quot; or &quot;-poma&quot; was used as a suffix after the names of places, to mean a subgroup of people of the place. By 1877, the meaning of the word &quot;Pomo&quot; had been broadened, at least in the English language, to refer to not only the Pomo language but the entire group of people speaking it, as well—the people known as Pomo, today.

==History==

The people called Pomo were originally linked by location, language, and cultural expression. They were not socially or politically linked as a unified group. Instead, they lived in small groups or bands linked by lineage and marriage.

===Precontact===
According to certain linguistic hypotheses, the Pomo descend from Hokan-speaking peoples; per this theory, a Hokan-speaking people migrated into the upland valley regions near Clear Lake ca. 7000 BCE, where their language evolved into Proto-Pomoan. Another theory places the Pomoan ancestral community in the Sonoma region, where coastal redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) forests met with inland valleys and mixed woodlands, bolstered by Clear Lake and its abundant natural resources. Around 4000 BCE to 5000 BCE, some of these people relocated into the areas of today&#x27;s Russian River Valley and northward, near present-day Ukiah. Their language diverged into western, southern, central, and northern Pomoan, respectively.

Another people, possibly Yukian speakers, lived first in the Russian River Valley and Lake Sonoma areas prior to being displaced by the Pomo, who subsequently took over the region. Modern archaeological analyses and discoveries have suggested that the local economy, which was based on women processing acorns by mortar and pestle, and first observed by the Spanish upon their arrival in Central California, may have developed during the Mostin culture period (ca. 8500 BP–6300 BP) in the Clear Lake Basin.

====Tolay Lake site====
More than a thousand precontact charmstones and numerous arrowheads have been unearthed at Tolay Lake, southern Sonoma County, attributed to both Pomo and Coast Miwok people. A sacred site, the lake is a ceremonial gathering and healing place.

====Lake Sonoma sites====
*At the &quot;broken bridge&quot; site, researchers using radiocarbon dating of artifacts determined it was inhabited ca. 3280 BCE, the oldest human habitation documented in the valley. They consider it part of the Skaggs Phase (3000–500 BCE).
*&quot;Oregon Oak Place&quot; was dated at 1843 BCE; surveyors suggested that, compared to the lower river valleys, this remote area was only sparsely inhabited before the Pomo arrived.

Both of these Skaggs-Phase sites contained millstones and other handstones for grinding seed and nuts. The villages may have been used for hunting or temporary camps. Obsidian was used, albeit rarely, from Mount Konocti, in present-day Lake County. There were no petroglyphs. The population lived only along major creeks.

The &quot;Dry Creek&quot; Phase lasted from 500 BCE to [1300 CE. During this phase, the Indigenous people settled the lands more extensively, and permanently. Archaeologists believe a Pomo group took over the lands from earlier peoples during this phase. They founded 14 additional sites in the Warm Springs and Upper Dry Creek areas. Bowls, mortars, and pestles appeared in this phase, probably used by women to pound acorns (as opposed to the milling stones used for seeds). The sites were more settled and, likewise, more &quot;complex&quot;. Trade took place on a larger scale beyond the region. Decorative beads and ornaments were made in this phase, and approximately half of the artifacts were made of obsidian. Steatite or soapstone objects were also found, which must have been imported into the region through trade, as the rocks do not exist locally. Relatively soft and easy to carve, soapstone was used to make beads, pendants, as well as mortars. The largest and only substantial steatite mine in California existed on Catalina Island, one of the Channel Islands off the coast of what is now Los Angeles County. The existence of steatite in Pomo and Northern California Native sites is a strong indicator of the size and complexity of Native California trade networks.

The next phase, named the &quot;Smith Phase&quot; after the Pomo consultants, lasted from 1300 CE to the mid-19th century. Researchers mapped 30 sites in this era, showing a gradual evolving and intensification of trends. Archery, and its associated applications, was a major technological advancement which greatly benefited the population. The production of shell beads (and drills to create holes in beads), remained important, with drills being found in high numbers. Numerous clamshell beads, a major currency among the peoples of Central California, were also found, also suggesting a vast trade network.

===Post contact===

There were an estimated 8,000 to 21,000 Pomo among 70 tribes speaking seven Pomo languages at the time of European contact. The way of life of the Pomo changed with the arrival of Russians at Fort Ross (1812 to 1841) on the Pacific coastline, and Spanish missionaries and European-American colonists]coming in from the south and east. The Pomo who lived on the coastline and near Fort Ross were known as the Kashaya. They interacted and traded with the Russians.

The Spanish missionaries stole or enslaved many of the southern Pomo from the Santa Rosa Plain to Mission San Rafael, at present-day San Rafael, between 1821 and 1828. Only a few Pomo speakers went to Mission Sonoma, the other Franciscan mission, located on the north side of San Francisco Bay. The Pomo who remained in the present-day Santa Rosa area of Sonoma County were often called &quot;Cainameros&quot; in regional history books from the time of Spanish and Mexican occupation.

In the Russian River Valley, a missionary colonized and baptized the Makahmo Pomo people of the Cloverdale area. Many Pomo left the valley because of this. One such group fled to the Upper Dry Creek Area. The archeology surveyors of the Lake Sonoma region believe that European and Euro-American encroachment was the reason why Pomo villages became more centralized; the people retreated to the remote valley to band together for defense and mutual support.

The Pomo suffered from the infectious diseases brought by the Euro-American migrants, including cholera and smallpox. They did not have immunity to such diseases and fatalities were high. In 1837 a deadly epidemic of smallpox, originating in settlements at Fort Ross, caused numerous deaths of native people in the Sonoma and Napa regions. Mission treatment of Pomo was similar to that of slavery, and many Pomo died due to inhospitable living conditions.

The Russian River Valley was settled in 1850 by the 49ers, and the Lake Sonoma Valley was homesteaded out. The US government forced many Pomo on to reservations so that the European-Americans could homestead the former Pomo lands. Some Pomo took jobs as ranch laborers; others lived in refugee villages.

During this time, two white settlers named Andrew Kelsey and Charles Stone enslaved many Pomo people in order to work as cowboys on their ranch. They forced the Pomo Indians to work in very intense and unorthodox conditions and sexually abused the Pomo women. The Pomo men were forced to work in harsh conditions and were not given any respect by the settlers. Exasperated with the violence and oppression of Stone and Kelsey, they rebelled.

The Pomo men set up a sneak attack and killed both Stone and Kelsey. Because of the deaths of Kelsey and Stone, United States lieutenant J. W. Davidson and captain Nathaniel Lyon sent an army to retaliate against the Pomo people. During the Bloody Island Massacre of 1850, on an island in Clear Lake the 1st Dragoons US Cavalry slaughtered between 60 and 100 people, mostly women and children of the Clear Lake Pomo and neighboring tribes.
Shortly after the massacre, during 1851 and 1852, four reservations for the Pomo were established by the United States government in California. Pomo were also part of the forced relocation known as the &quot;Marches to Round Valley&quot; in 1856, conducted by the U.S. federal government. By using bullwhips and guns, white settlers demanded relocation to reservations of the Pomo Indian. The justification given was that to protect their culture, the Pomo Indians had to be removed from their ancestral land.

Richerson &amp; Richerson stated that before the European conquests there was an estimated 3,000 Pomo Indians that lived at Clear Lake; after all of the death, disease, and killings, there were only about 400 Pomo Indians left.

One ghost town in the Lake Sonoma Valley excavations was identified as Amacha, built for 100 people but hardly used. Elder natives of the region remember their grandfathers hid at Amacha in the mid-1850s, trying to evade the colonizing settlers. They tell that one day soldiers took all the people in the village to government lands and burned the village houses.

From 1891 to 1935, starting with &quot;National Thorn&quot;, the artist Grace Hudson painted more than 600 portraits, mainly of Pomo individuals living near her in the Ukiah area. Her style was sympathetic and poignant, as she portrayed domestic native scenes that would have been fast disappearing in that time.

==Population==
===Demographics===
In 1770 there were about 8,000 Pomo people; in 1851 population was estimated between 3,500 and 5,000; and in 1880 estimated at 1,450. Anthropologist Samuel Barrett estimated a population of 747 in 1908, but that is probably low; fellow anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber reported 1,200 Pomo counted in the 1910 Census. According to the 1930 Census there were 1,143 Pomo, and by the 1990 Census there were 4,766.

According to the 2010 United States Census, there are 10,308 Pomo people in the United States. Of these, 8,578 reside in California.

===Languages===
Pomo, also known as Pomoan or less commonly Kulanapan, is a language family that includes seven distinct and mutually unintelligible languages, including Northern Pomo, Northeastern Pomo, Eastern Pomo, Southeastern Pomo, Central Pomo, Southern Pomo, and Kashaya. John Wesley Powell classified the language family as Kulanapan in 1891, using the name first introduced by George Gibbs in 1853. This name for the language family is derived from the name of one Eastern Pomo village on the south shore of Clear Lake. Stephen Powers (1877) was the first to refer to this entire language family with the name &quot;Pomo&quot;, and the geographic names that have been used to refer to the seven individual Pomoan languages (e.g. Southeastern Pomo) were introduced by Samuel Barrett (1908).

The Pomoan languages became severely endangered after European-American colonization of their native territory. Contacts with Russians, the Spanish, and Euro-Americans have impacted these languages, and many are no longer spoken due to language shift to English, accelerated by policies such as the 1887 ban on the teaching in Native American languages put into place by John DeWitt Clinton Atkins. There are about twelve Pomo language varieties that are still in use by Pomo people. One, , which is spoken by Elem Pomo, is in the process of revival due to efforts by Clear Lake Pomo Cultural Preservation Foundation.

==Culture==

The Pomo Indian cultures are several ethnolinguistic groups that make up a single language family in Northern California. Pomo cultures originally encompassed hundreds of independent communities.

Like many other Native groups, the Pomo Indians of Northern California relied upon fishing, hunting, and gathering for their daily food supply. They ate salmon, wild greens, gnats, mushrooms, berries, grasshoppers, rabbits, rats, and squirrels. Acorns were the most important staple in their diet. The division of labor in Pomo Indian communities typically involved gathering and preparation of plant-based foods by women, while men were hunters and fishers.
===Religion===

The Pomo people participated in shamanism; one form this took was the Kuksu religion, which was held by people in Central and Northern California. It included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty rites of passage, shamanic intervention with the spirit world, and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms. The Pomo believed in a supernatural being, the &quot;Kuksu&quot; or &quot;Guksu&quot; (depending on their dialect), who lived in the south and who came during ceremonies to heal their illnesses, along with spirits from six cardinal directions, and Coyote as their ancestor and creator god. Medicine men dressed up as &quot;Kuksu&quot;, their interpretation of a healer spirit.

In 1872, the first Ghost Dance was introduced to the Pomo by a Wintun dreamer and quickly spread. The initial introduction was of the Earth Lodge cult derivation which had begun in Wintu lands, with Bole Maru appearing in Patwin lands and spreading to the Pomo as well soon after. In 1874, the Big Head cult grew out of Bole Maru, but with less of a focus on dreamers and their visions, which spread all the way north to the Shasta. While the Earth Lodge cult and Big Head cult died out pretty quickly, Bole Maru stuck around and has continued to be practiced since, though Mabel McKay, the last Pomo dreamer, died in 1993.

===Traditional narratives===

The record of Pomo myths, legends, tales, and histories is extensive. The body of narratives is classed within the Central California cultural pattern.

===Ethnobotany===
Carex roots are used to make baskets, and used to tend fishing traps. They are also used to make torches.

==Basket weaving tradition==
Pomo baskets made by Pomo Indian women of Northern California are recognized worldwide for their exquisite appearance, range of technique, fineness of weave, and diversity of form and use. While women mostly made baskets for cooking, storing food, and religious ceremonies, Pomo men also made baskets for fishing weirs, bird traps, and baby baskets.
Making the baskets required great skill and knowledge in collecting and preparing the needed materials. Materials for weaving baskets changed with the seasons and years. The Pomo usually covered a basket completely with the vivid red feathers of the pileated woodpecker until the surface resembled the smoothness of the bird itself. With the feathers, 30–50 to every inch, beads were fastened to the basket&#x27;s border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from the basket itself. Pomo women sometimes spent months or years making such gift baskets.

The materials used to make the baskets—including, but not limited to, swamp canes, saguaro cactuses, rye grass, black ash, willow shoots, sedge roots, the bark of redbud, the root of bulrush, and the root of the gray pine—were harvested annually. After being picked, the materials are dried, cleaned, split, soaked, and dyed. Sometimes the materials are also boiled over a fire and set in the sun to dry.

Women traditionally wove Pomo baskets with great care and technique. The three different techniques of Pomo basket weaving are plaiting, coiling, and twining. One drying method was wrapping maiden fern in blue clay and placing underground for several days. This prevented fading in the sun or when cooking mush.

There are many different designs that are woven into the baskets that signify different cultural meanings. For example, the Dau is a pattern woven into a basket by creating a small change in the stitching to create a small opening between two stitches. The Dau is the design that is also called the Spirit Door. This Spirit Door allows good spirits to come and circulate inside of the basket while the good or bad spirits are released.
Although baskets were made for decorating homes and as gifts, they were centrally used in Pomo daily life as well. Basket weaving is considered sacred to the Pomo tribe and baskets were produced for a variety of purposes. Pomo children were cradled in baskets, acorns (a major food staple to the Pomo) were harvested in great conical burden baskets, and food was stored, cooked, and served in baskets—some even being watertight. There were even &quot;baskets&quot; that were made as boats to be pushed by men to carry women across rivers.

===Post-contact===
A commercial market for authentic baskets developed in the latter part of the 19th century, lasting from about 1876 to the 1930s. Two Pomo people who capitalized on this market were William Ralganal Benson and his wife, Mary Knight Benson and the Bensons may have been the first California Indians who supported themselves solely by crafting and selling their baskets to collectors and museums.

Even though most of their original land was taken over, this was the first turning point for the Pomo people. They had finally escaped the harsh road they were once a part of, and even though they had to settle on poor, isolated land, they finally got to make a stride towards tradition and basket weaving. From 1852 to 1878, many Pomo Indians tried to rekindle their cultures and find peace to what had happened to them. Many people let this time be a learning and spiritual time, where they could have visions and see what the future would have in store. It was a time to build, a time to connect, a time of hope, and a time of change.
The Pomo Indians did not have enough money to buy land. The Pomo men decided to work for ranchers and the woman went back to making baskets. The &quot;white&quot; people loved the baskets, especially the designer, feathered ones, which led to a basketry movement. Finally, in 1878, the Pomo Indians bought their first piece of land in California. Paula Giese noted, &quot;In 1878, a group of Northern Pomo people bought 7 acres in Coyote Valley. In 1880, another Northern Pomo group bought 100 acres along Ackerman Creek (now known as Pinoleville)&quot;. In 1881, Yokaya Rancheria was financed by central Pomo people. Once the Pomo Indians had bought the land, it was time to make money.

Baskets were in so much demand at this point, even though they were once used for trade and bartering with other tribes and people, they now became the Pomo people&#x27;s way to make money and build their newly found empires. Women had preserved Pomo basket weaving traditions, which made a huge change for the Pomo people. The baskets were wanted all over California; it was a piece of art that traders wanted. Grandmothers and daughters taught other Pomo women, who had lost the tradition of basket weaving, how to make the all-powerful baskets.

Within this time period in addition to basket weaving, the Pomo also manufactured elaborate jewelry made from abalone and clamshells. Assembled during the winter, during the summer the Pomo would travel from various sites along the coast where they would fish and gather all of their materials needed to create their jewelry. The Pomo Indians would create stunning, beautiful, and intricate forms of jewelry that were worn during celebrations and rituals, and even given as gifts. Both of these traditions of creation and culture have slowly dispersed and have become less common over the history of the tribe but more evident in today&#x27;s culture.

===Basket weaving today===
Pomo basket weaving is still valued and honored today, not only by the Pomo Indians themselves, but also by amateur enthusiasts, buyers for curio dealers, and scientific collectors. The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria are a federally recognized American Indian tribe of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo Indians. During the past 30 years, the appreciation for American Indian art has been on the rise, and the art has become in demand – specifically Pomo Indian basketry. Dr. Joallyn Archambault, director of the American Indian Program at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of Natural History says: &quot;Since the 1880s, when Pomo baskets first became sought after, the Pomo have changed their lifestyles enormously.&quot; Pomo today live normal modern lifestyles, but the basket weavers are still heralded and praised within the community for their artistic ability and skill.

One of those basket weavers is Julia F. Parker. She is a master weaver, having woven under Lucy Telles. Her childhood was rough, constantly moving around until boarding school after her parents&#x27; death at 6. Lucy had taught Julia because of her perceived interest in preserving Indian culture and specifically basketry. Julia Parker became a cultural demonstrator after Lucy Telles died in 1956. She continued in her studies and later studied Pomo basketry with Pomo master weaver Elsie Allen (1899–1990) at Ukiah and several others. Julia belongs to the Miwok Pomo and Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria. Many of her baskets are in museums in Yosemite, Mono Lake and other museums; she even presented her baskets to Queen Elizabeth II.

They wove baskets from sedge root, willow shoots and roots, bulrush or blackroot, redbud shoots, and sometimes bracken fern and a variety of colorful bird feathers, abalone and other types of shells, or magnesite beads and sometimes glass beads. Redbud shoots, used for the darker reddish colors in basket designs are gathered in October. Good redbud is hard to obtain around Ukiah, so it is usually found at Clear Lake. All these materials are gathered with a thankful heart and the gatherers talk continuously to the plants. They were, after all, living things that were giving themselves for something useful and beautiful. In order to preserve the soil and creek banks, sedge gathering was done with care. The commonly held decision would be leaving behind about half of what was found. Dyeing of the bulrush root takes about three to six months in a concoction of black walnuts, rusty metal and ashes in water.

Today, new Pomo baskets might sell for as much as $1,000, and the more historical ones might sell for more than $10,000. Dealing of these baskets has not always been so lucrative and many have tried to exploit the artists and communities. Dealers and collectors may have exploited the lucrative basket market, but it still paid well enough to provide income to Pomo women where hunting and gathering were no longer feasible and money was needed for survival.

Today you will see rare baskets being sold for the prices mentioned above. Due to the time and preparation necessary to weave these pieces of art; basket weavers today have more requests than they can fulfill, and many customers wait months before receiving orders. The rarity of the baskets and the skill are required in making them in what makes them valuable. The demand is greater than the supply, and collectors facilitate a high demand for these artistically made baskets.

==Villages and communities==
===Federally recognized tribes===

Today, federally recognized tribes have sovereignty and relations with the United States federal government. Classified as &quot;domestic dependent nations,&quot; these tribes are under the jurisdiction of the federal government, but with some autonomy from their respective states, including California.

Federally recognized Pomo tribes are based in Sonoma, Lake, and Mendocino counties. They include the following tribes:

*Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians of the Big Valley Rancheria
*Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California
*Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California
*Dry Creek Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California
*Elem Indian Colony of Pomo Indians of the Sulphur Bank Rancheria
*Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria (a tribe of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo)
*Guidiville Rancheria of California
*Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake
*Hopland Band of Pomo Indians of the Hopland Rancheria
*Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria
*Koi Nation of the Lower Lake Rancheria
*Lytton Rancheria of California
*Manchester Band of Pomo Indians of the Manchester Rancheria
*Middletown Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California
*Pinoleville Pomo Nation
*Potter Valley Tribe
*Redwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California
*Robinson Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California
*Round Valley Indian Tribes of the Round Valley Reservation (a confederation of several tribes, including Pomo)
*Scotts Valley Band of Pomo Indians of California
*Sherwood Valley Rancheria of Pomo Indians of California
Other self-identified Native American groups are not federally recognized.

=== California Rancheria Termination Acts ===
Many Pomo were impacted by the California Rancheria Termination Acts and lost lands due to lack of understanding the tax system, along with predation by merchants who took advantage of land-rich but cash-poor tribal members. Along with losing their lands, the tribes lost their status as federally recognized tribes and the ability to access federal clinics that served other federally recognized tribes. In a decision dated July 19, 1983 the United States District Court for the Northern District of California restored the status of 17 California rancherias in &quot;Hardwick v. United States&quot;.

===Historical groups===
The Pomo people were traditionally divided into several large groupings, each speaking its own language. While these had no overarching governance structure and villages were politically independent, they had some cultural differences and were recognizable as units to those who lived in them:

* Kashia (Southwestern Pomo)
* Southern Pomo
* Central Pomo
* Northern Pomo
* Tceefoka (Northeastern or Salt Pomo)
* Eastern Pomo (Clear Lake Pomo), spoke Bahtssal
* Elem Pomo (Southeastern Pomo)
