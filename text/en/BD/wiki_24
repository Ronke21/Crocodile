<text>Kinderhook (&quot;Kinderhoeck&quot; in Dutch) is a village in the town of Kinderhook in Columbia County, New York, United States. The village population was 1,170 at the 2020 census, slightly down from 1,211 at the 2010 census. The village of Kinderhook is located in the south-central part of the town on US 9. The eighth President of the United States, Martin Van Buren, was born in Kinderhook and retired to the area (Lindenwald).

==History==
The area was named by Henry Hudson in 1609 as &quot;Kinderhoeck&quot; (Dutch for &quot;children&#x27;s corner&quot;) because he had seen Native American children frequently playing there. First settled by the Dutch around 1640, the area was surrendered to the English in 1664.

In 1686, the area was granted the Great Kinderhook Patent and organized into one township.

Much of the area&#x27;s growth did not occur until the 19th century - in 1813, the village had only twenty dwellings. By 1843, the number had grown to 86, and just seven years later, there were about 200 buildings and 1,400 inhabitants. The size of the village has remained steady since then, and the Kinderhook Village District has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1974. In 1838, Kinderhook was chartered as a village.

United States President Martin Van Buren was born in the town of Kinderhook, and was known as &quot;Old Kinderhook&quot;. The home where he was raised, his father&#x27;s tavern, no longer exists; however, a historical marker is located near the site at 46Â Hudson Street. The Martin Van Buren National Historic Site, Van Buren&#x27;s retirement home is located south of the village and is open to the public. Van Buren&#x27;s burial place is in the Kinderhook Reformed Church Cemetery along Albany Avenue in the northwest part of the village, about a half mile from his childhood home.

U.S. Route 9 runs through Kinderhook and intersects with Columbia County route 21 at the center of the village. Northwest of the intersection, CR 21 is known as Albany Avenue, while southeast it is called Hudson Street.

<text>Kinderhook is a town in the northern part of Columbia County, New York, United States. The population was 8,330 at the 2020 census, making it the most populous municipality in Columbia County. The name of the town means &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; in the language of the original Dutch settlers (&quot;Kinderhoek&quot;). The name &quot;Kinderhook&quot; has its root in the landing of Henry Hudson in the area around present-day Stuyvesant, where he was greeted by Native Americans with many children. With the Dutch &quot;kind&quot; meaning &quot;child&quot; and &quot;hoek&quot; meaning &quot;corner&quot;, it could be that the name refers to a bend (or &quot;corner&quot;) in the river where the children are. The eighth president of the United States, Martin Van Buren, was born in Kinderhook and retired to it.

The town of Kinderhook contains two villages, one of which is also named Kinderhook; the other is the village of Valatie. In addition, the town contains the hamlet of Niverville, next to Kinderhook Lake.

== History ==
In 1609 Henry Hudson sailed as far north as Kinderhook on his exploration of the Hudson River and named the location &quot;Kinderhoek&quot;. &quot;Kinderhook&quot; signifies in the Dutch tongue &quot;the children&#x27;s corner&quot;, and is supposed to have been applied to this locality, in 1609, on account of the many Indian children who had assembled on one of the bluffs along the river to see his strange vessel (the &quot;Half Moon&quot;) sailing upstream. Hudson had mixed dealing with the local Mohican natives, ranging from peaceful trade to minor skirmishes. As the Dutch attempted to colonize the area, further warfare broke out with the natives. Another version says that a Swede named Scherb, living in the forks of an Indian trail in the present town of Stuyvesant, had such a numerous family of children that the name of Kinderhook was used by the Dutch traders to designate that locality. A third theory about the town&#x27;s name derives from a settler, named Frans Pietersz. Clauw, who operated a mill on the river and was known as the &quot;child of luxury&quot; (&quot;Kind van Weelde&quot;).

Kinderhook was settled before 1651 and established as a town in 1788 from a previously created district (1772), but lost substantial territory to form part of the town of Chatham in 1775. Kinderhook was one of the original towns of Columbia County. More of Kinderhook was lost to form the town of Ghent in 1818 and the town of Stuyvesant in 1823.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.87%, is water, including Kinderhook Lake, Kinderhook Creek, and the waterfalls of Valatie.

The northern town line is the border of Rensselaer County.

Kinderhook Creek is an important stream in the town, flowing southwest toward tidal Stockport Creek, an arm of the Hudson River. U.S. Route 9 and New York State Route 9H pass through the town.

==Arts and culture==
President Martin Van Buren&#x27;s retirement home, Lindenwald, is in the town of Kinderhook. The Dutch Colonial Luykas Van Alen House, a National Historic Landmark (c.1737), is thought to be author Washington Irving&#x27;s inspiration for the &quot;Van Tassel family&quot; farm in his classic story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot;, as Irving â a friend of Van Buren â was a frequent visitor and sometime resident to the area. The 19th-century rural Ichabod Crane Schoolhouse, named for the Washington Irving character patterned after Kinderhook schoolteacher, Jesse Merwin, is adjacent to the Van Alen House.

The Columbia County Historical Society is headquartered in the town, with four historic properties, including the 1737 Luykas Van Alen House, the 1850 Ichabod Crane Schoolhouse, the c1819 James Vanderpoel &#x27;House of History&#x27;, and the 1915 CCHS Museum &amp; Library building. The Historical Society also owns and exhibits a permanent collection consisting of important and unique genealogical materials, archives, paintings, textiles, furniture and decorative arts relating to Columbia County&#x27;s culture and heritage.

The James Vanderpoel House, known as &quot;The House of History&quot;, on Broad Street in Kinderhook village was built circa 1819 and is an important example of high-style Federal architecture that is owned and maintained by the Columbia County Historical Society. The Old Columbia Academy was an early Dutch school established on March 13, 1787. The school was renamed Kinderhook Academy on April 3, 1824.

The former Martin Van Buren Public School, on Broad Street, now houses an international gallery of contemporary fine art, The School, a branch of the Jack Shainman Gallery, New York.

The Olde Kinderhook Fair, also called the Kindercrafters Fair, is an annual arts and crafts fair held in the Kinderhook Village Square and sponsored by the Kinderhook Business and Professional Association. Other activities are often scheduled for the fair day, such as the Kinderhook Memorial Library Book Sale, free tours of the James Vanderpoel House, and live music. The 42nd fair was held in June 2018.

The name was in honor of founder Ebenezer Foote, who was known as &quot;The Great Mogul&quot;. Another founder, Erastus Root, a rival of Foote, is responsible for the pronunciation.

Might as well call it Foote-high.&quot; Another explanation of its pronunciation is &quot;Because itâs HIGH on the DELaware River.&quot;

==History==

The town of Franklin lies in the northern part of Delaware County, in an area of wooded hills, streams, ponds, historic homes, commercial buildings, and numerous winding roads. Its surface is hilly upland made of shaley loam atop hardpan, while the valleys consist of gravelly loam and alluvium.

Ouleout Creek, which flows into the Susquehanna River, is the main surface water feature. The waterway was important to village development, not only for water supply but as transportation arteries for travel as well as shipment of lumber and goods to market.

The village of Franklin was platted in 1827 by John Edgerton, who had bought for the site. Accompanied by the French Lyons descendants It was incorporated in 1836. Throughout the 19th century, the town and village adapted to changes in agricultural demand. Before the Civil War, raising sheep and processing wool was more profitable than the cultivation of grain or rearing of cattle. With the competition by canals and railroads for traffic, the Catskill Turnpike lost some of its business. This resulted in an economic decline in the village.

In 1835, the town gained approval by the state legislature for what it called the Delaware Literary Institute, for higher education. Local students and others from different states paid tuition at this well-received school. Three major buildings were constructed: Stone and Chapel halls. The Civil War and growing tax support for public schools brought about a decline in attendance. The trustees deeded all of DLI&#x27;s facilities to District 10. With centralization in 1929, the Franklin Central School was created. The following year voters authorized the official name of the school to be Delaware Literary Institute and Franklin Central School, thus preserving part of the past.

By 1860, Franklin village streets showed many fine residences built in the Federal, Greek Revival, Italianate Revival and Gothic styles. Main Street bustled with commercial activity.

Printer George W. Reynolds published and edited Franklin&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Weekly Visitor,&quot; from 1855 to 1863. It was succeeded after the Civil War by the &quot;Franklin Register,&quot; 1868-1883, which changed to the &quot;Delaware County Dairyman&quot; in 1883-1952. The First National Bank of Franklin was founded in 1863, Amos Douglas being its first president. This bank served the community until 1933, closing during the Great Depression.

In the aftermath of the Civil War, dairying became more important; production of milk, butter, and cheese all increased. A creamery association was formed to develop and market dairy products, especially to the major market of metropolitan New York. In addition to licensed taverns, inns, and hotel, the business directory for the town included dry goods, hardware, furniture, grocery, druggists, carriagemakers, coopers, harness makers, shoemakers, foundry, cigar company, telegraph, ice cream parlor, marble works, doctors, dentists, lawyers, and other vocations.

The trustees of the DLI voted to ask the Board of Regents to establish teacher training at the school and gained the founding of a Normal School in Oneonta, now the State University of New York at Oneonta.

Near the village, the Ouleout Valley Cemetery on Route 357, beginning in 1873, often draws attention for its handsome iron gate and well-manicured grounds. Annual Memorial Day observances have been held at the Soldiers Monument since its dedication in 1889.

Many villages and town community and fraternal associations were started in the 19th century. These included the volunteer Fire Department, Masonic Lodge, Odd Fellows Lodge, Sportsmen&#x27;s Association, Washington Reading Circle, and Onesiphorus, and the Free Library.

In 1990, the census showed a population of 409 in the Village of Franklin. The number of active farms continued to decline, and absentee ownership increased. Few new businesses survive, and a substantial number of people are retired or commute to work outside the town. Franklin Central School completed a building program in 1991. An annual Franklin Day is held in August to raise funds for the preservation of Stone Hall, once part of the Delaware Literary Institute.

In 1983, the village of Franklin was designated an historic district and placed on the National Register of Historic Places. This noteworthy honour was a memorable beginning in the continued preservation of Franklin&#x27;s architectural treasures.

In 1992, the town of Franklin celebrated its bicentennial with many events. On July 25, 1992, dozens of groups marched along Main Street of the village in the bicentennial parade, which was videotaped for later viewing. The Ouleout Valley Historical Society published &quot;Throughout the Years in the Town of Franklin 1792-1992.&quot;

The Franklin Stage Company currently occupies Chapel Hall (once part of the Delaware Literary Institute) located at 25 Institute Street. Since 1997, the Franklin Stage Company has done extensive renovations to the building and also raised money through foundations and government grants to support their work. The Stage Company is funded in part by the New York State Council on the Arts.

Since late 2001 the Greater Franklin Chamber of Commerce has maintained a website, which serves as a central community hub for information and news.

<text>Franklin is a town in Delaware County, New York, United States. The population was 2,288 at the 2020 census. The town contains a village also named Franklin. The village is the population center. The town is on the county&#x27;s northern border.

== History ==

Little is known of the area prior to the American Revolution. Areas along the waterways were occupied by bands of Lenape (Delaware) people primarily, with remnants of other tribes who had been pushed west across the Hudson by English colonial development. Hunters and fur trappers also visited the area.

After the war, speculators, often based in New York City, bought various land patents sight unseen, as they were lured by dreams of profit-taking as land was resold to settlers. Hundreds of settlers had moved into the town of Harpersfield in what is now Delaware County.

On April 10, 1792, the State Legislature passed &quot;An Act For Dividing the Several Towns,

...That all that part of the town of Harpersfield, lying south of a line to be drawn, beginning at the southeasterly bank of the river Susquehannah, from thence running a south-easterly course to the northwest corner of others, thence running on the northeast line of Whites-Borough until it comes to the Cachquago branch of the river Delaware, thence down the said river to the line of property, thence along the said line of property, until it comes to the river Susquehannah, opposite to the river Unadilla, thence up the said river Susquehannah, to the place of beginning, shall be and hereby is erected into a town, by the name of Franklin, and that the first town meeting shall be held at the house of Sluman Wattles Esquire, in the said town...&quot;

Six men, including William Franklin, eldest son of statesman Benjamin Franklin, owned east of the town of Franklin, named the Franklin Patent. The new town of Franklin underwent several changes over the following decades, as areas were developed and split off. The Skovsende and Sitts family, primarily Georgetta and Traci, have maintained much control over the land with their wood and dairy businesses respectively.

Sluman Wattles was the first European-American settler in 1785, followed by Nathaniel Edgerton, James Follett, Alex Smith, Enos Parker, Asa Turner, and hundreds of others, many of them migrants from New England.

In 1797 part of the town was split off to become the town of Walton. The law provided that Franklin and Walton would divide &quot;existing money and poor people&quot;, as shall appear most equitable to the major part of them. Further changes to the town boundaries occurred when Meredith was taken off in 1800, Sidney in 1801, and the &quot;Huntsville&quot; portion of Otego in 1822.

Franklin was originally part of Otsego County. On May 30, 1797, the first annual meeting of the Board of Supervisors was held at Gideon Frisbee&#x27;s house to proceed with the formation of Delaware County. Franklin and six other towns were represented at this meeting.

In 1800, Franklin&#x27;s first census showed a population of 1,390. Most of the people who were not clearing isolated land were clustered in settlements at Bartlett Hollow and Leonta. On September 30, 1800, Franklin became the first United States post office in the county, with Elias Osborn appointed as its first postmaster. On June 30, 2012, Jonathan Lockwood took over the reins of Postmaster.

The land yielded pine, beech, maple, oak, hickory, and chestnut. Lumber was carted to the Delaware and Susquehanna rivers, where it was rafted to the cities. Large amounts of grain were harvested. As in many frontier communities, distilleries converted the surplus into thousands of barrels of whiskey, which were shipped to Philadelphia and New York. A local market for pork developed.

Cattle drovers guided their herds eastward to market along the newly formed Catskill and Susquehanna Turnpike. This toll road spurred trade between Catskill and Wattle&#x27;s Ferry. Towns along this road grew as taverns, hotels, liveries, and other facilities developed to support the endless movement of wagons, animals, and people. The villages of Franklin and Treadwell (formerly known as Jug Town and Croton) prospered. Strong ties with agriculture also grew as the villages served as trading centers for the growing needs of farmers.

Throughout the 19th century, Franklin had to adapt to changes in agriculture. Before the Civil War, raising sheep and processing wool surpassed the cultivation of grain and cattle. Traffic on the Catskill Turnpike declined as canals and railroads successfully competed for transportation business.

Despite this loss of trade, Franklin continued to grow in population, institutions and businesses. In 1793, the Baptist and Congregational churches organized and remained notable religious influences in Franklin. In 1833, decades of circuit riding preacher visits ended with the establishment of the Methodist Church. By 1865, there were eight churches in town: two Baptist, one Congregational, three Methodist, one Presbyterian, and one Episcopal.

In 1835â36, the community organized for long-term improvements. It financed a well-engineered road between Franklin and Oneonta through the sale of $25 shares in the Franklin &amp; Oneonta Turnpike Company. The village of Franklin became the town&#x27;s population center, especially after John Edgerton purchased and platted street and lot layouts in 1827. In 1836, the village became incorporated.

Formal education began in the town with the construction of a schoolhouse in Bartlett Hollow. By 1840, there were 25 school districts in Franklin. Residents believed that higher education was needed. They gained approval by the state legislature in 1835 for a grant of incorporation for the Delaware Literary Institute. In time, three large buildings, Stone, Ladies, and Chapel halls, were built with financing by Franklin&#x27;s citizens. Local students and others from different states paid tuition at this well-received school.

The disruption of the Civil War and growing tax support for public schools brought about a decline in attendance. The school trustees deeded all of DLI&#x27;s facilities to District 10. With centralization in 1929, the Franklin Central School was created. The following year voters authorized the official name of the school to be Delaware Literary Institute and Franklin Central School, thus preserving part of the past.

By 1860, the census showed that there were 3,308 people in the town. Franklin village streets showed many fine residences built in the Federal, Greek Revival, Italianate Revival and Gothic styles. Main Street bustled with commercial activity.

Franklin&#x27;s support of the military dated from 1792, when a local militia was formed. During the War of 1812, three companies of Franklin men served at Sackets Harbor, New York, which became the site of a major naval shipyard on Lake Ontario and a defensive army installation, and at New York City. In 1845, Franklin&#x27;s militia was called out to guard Delhi during the Anti-Rent crisis. Civil War records indicate that 318 men served different periods of enlistment in Franklin&#x27;s Company D of the 144th Regiment, or in filling other Delaware County town quotas. Franklin men have continued to serve in all of this nation&#x27;s wars. The militia stands strong today with Jody Pinney as head of the Commando 450s. According to the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, &quot;Groups of armed individuals that engage in paramilitary activity or law enforcement functions without being called forth by a governor or the federal government and without reporting to any government authority are acting as
unauthorized private militias.&quot; In addition, the Anti-Defamation League warns that modern militia groups are anti-government, conspiracy-oriented ideology.

Printer George W. Reynolds published and edited Franklin&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Weekly Visitor,&quot; from 1855 to 1863. It was succeeded by the &quot;Franklin Register,&quot; 1868-1883, which changed to the &quot;Delaware County Dairyman,&quot; 1883-1952. The First National Bank of Franklin was founded in 1863, Amos Douglas being its first president. This bank served the community until 1933, forced to close during the hard times of the Great Depression.

In the aftermath of the Civil War, many social and economic changes occurred in Franklin. In terms of agriculture, dairying took on increasing importance, with milk, butter, and cheese all showing production increases. A creamery association was formed to develop and market dairy products, often to the major market of metropolitan New York City. In addition to licensed taverns, inns, and hotel, the business directory included dry goods, hardware, furniture, grocery, druggists, carriagemakers, coopers, harness makers, shoemakers, foundry, cigar company, telegraph, ice cream parlor, marble works, doctors, dentists, lawyers, and other vocations.

The railroad bypassed Franklin, except for the Ontario &amp; Western&#x27;s Franklin Depot. When the trustees of the D.L.I. voted to ask the Board of Regents to establish teacher training at the school, the end result was the founding of a normal school in Oneonta for teacher training. This has developed into SUNY Oneonta. A gradual decline in population continued through the first half of the 20th century, but it was reversed as people began to buy homes in the town for retirement or as second homes for recreation.

The Ouleout Valley Cemetery on Route 357, begun in 1873, often draws attention to its handsome iron gate and well-manicured grounds. The massive Erastus Edgerton Monument is impressive. The Soldiers&#x27; Monument was dedicated in 1889 to veterans particularly of the American Civil War, and annual Memorial Day observances have been held there since for all veterans.

Many of the community and fraternal organizations were started in the mid-19th century. Members of the volunteer Fire Department, Masonic Lodge, Odd Fellows Lodge, Sportsmen&#x27;s Association, Washington Reading Circle, Onesiphori, and the Free Library have all contributed to Franklin&#x27;s way of life.

Treadwell and Franklin also had strong chapters of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the Good Templars, organized to try to suppress drinking and drunkenness. In the 20th century, local sales of alcoholic beverages were controlled through the issuance of licenses by the town government. The fees collected were often used to aid the less fortunate. In the 21st century, Franklin continues to be a &quot;dry&quot; town.

In 1990, the census showed the town of Franklin with a population of 2,471, with 409 of them in the village of Franklin. The number of active farms continued to decline, absentee ownership increased, few new businesses survive, a substantial number of people retired or commuted to work. Franklin Central School completed a building program in 1991. An annual Franklin Day is held in August to raise funds for the preservation of Stone Hall.

In 1983, the village of Franklin was recognized for its architectural qualities and placed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. This noteworthy honor has aided the continued preservation of Franklin&#x27;s architectural treasures.

In 1992, the town of Franklin celebrated its bicentennial with many events. On July 25, 1992, dozens of groups marched along Main Street in the bicentennial parade, which was videotaped for later viewing. The Ouleout Valley Historical Society published &quot;Throughout the Years in the Town of Franklin 1792-1992.&quot; Some groups still march to this day with community leader Adam Davidson. He and fellow screenplay writer Keith have made their mark on the town.

<text>Hancock is a village in Delaware County, New York, United States. The population was 908 at the 2020 census. The village is in the west part of the town of Hancock at the junction of NY Routes 17 and 97.

Hancock is located at the confluence of the East and West branches of the Delaware River.

Hancock owes its former importance mainly to the Erie Railroad from 1848. The Erie merged into the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. The railroad still exists as the Southern Tier Line of the Norfolk Southern Railway, leased to the Central New York Railroad, but sees only a few freight trains weekly.

The Scranton Branch of the New York, Ontario and Western Railway bridged the West Branch of the Delaware River just west of the village; this railway&#x27;s main activity in the area was at Cadosia junction, a few miles up the East Branch of the Delaware River. Though the O&amp;W ceased operations on March 29, 1957, the bridge was not removed until the 1970s.

<doc id="259740" wikidata="Q3460542" url="?curid=259740" title="Sidney (village), New York">
<text>Sidney is a village in Delaware County, New York, United States. The population was 3,900 at the 2010 census. The village is in the western part of the town of Sidney.

==History==
The area now known as Sidney was inhabited by the Husatunnuk prior to its &quot;purchase&quot; from Goldsboro Banyar, of Albany, in 1771 by Rev. William Johnston, Presbyterian, born in Dublin, Ireland. The town was then called &quot;Johnston&quot; settlement until its renaming in 1801. 
The village was named for Admiral Sir Sidney Smith.

It is located nearly equidistant from Oneonta to the northeast, in the direction of the state capital Albany, and Binghamton to the southwest via I-88. Its position on the Susquehanna River makes it witness to the annual General Clinton Canoe Regatta. 

The largest local employer today is Amphenol followed by Keith Clark though the latter is reported to be closing. 

The town has also felt the loss of a local grocery, Price Chopper remains, and Kmart, as its manufacturing overall has declined over the last couple of decades. 

It&#x27;s local hospital, now part of Bassett A.O. Fox Hospital â Tri-Town Campus, has been closed except for the daytime critical care center. Two other outpatient clinics are also present nearby. 

The town continues to maintain its own local schools, library, EMS and fire district. 

Pioneer Cemetery and the Sidney Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In June 2006, Sidney, along with other parts of New York and Pennsylvania, was hit by severe flooding. Carr&#x27;s Creek washed out a section of Interstate 88 east of Sidney. At around 6:20Â am on Wednesday, June 28, two trucks from different directions drove into the chasm, apparently unaware of it, killing both drivers. David Swingle, 42, of Waverly, New York, who was driving westbound, was identified shortly after the accident. The eastbound trucker was Patrick O&#x27;Connell, 55, of Lisbon, Maine. His body was found downstream several days after the water receded.

The New York State Department of Transportation finished preliminary repairs on I-88 by the end of 2006. Additional construction was completed within the next year due to the settling of the highway.

The village itself was also flooded, particularly the westernmost part of the town on the south side of the Susquehanna River. Hardest hit were parts of Willow, Maple, Oak, Winegard, Bridge and River streets, some of which took on over of muddy water during the flood. Many other areas were also affected. The entire downtown area north of the railroad tracks was evacuated because of the rising levels of the Susquehanna River.

==Geography==
Sidney is located at the western end of the town of Sidney at (42.308175, -75.396465), on the south side of the Susquehanna River. It is in the northwest corner of Delaware County, bordered by Otsego County to the north across the Susquehanna and by Chenango County to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village of Sidney has a total area of , of which , or 0.64%, is water.

Interstate 88 passes just south of the village, with access from Exit 9 (New York State Route 8). I-88 leads northeast to Oneonta and southwest to Binghamton. Route 8 leads north to Utica and south to Deposit.

<text>Amenia is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population was 3,769 at the 2020 census, down from 4,436 at the 2010 census. The town is on the eastern border of the county.

== History ==
Amenia is one of the original towns formed by act of March 7, 1788. It comprises the width of the Oblong Tract, and the east tier of lots in the Great Nine Partners Patent.

Inhabitants prior to European incursion were Pequot, in a village on the west side of a pond they called Wequagnoch. Along with related Native Americans from Connecticut, they held Pow Wows on land both before and after the incorporation of the town.

In 1703 Richard Sackett was granted a patent for land along Wassaic Creek. As this land was already included in the previous Great Nine Partners Patent, Sackett&#x27;s title was invalid. Sackett was also one of the partners in the Little Nine Partners Patent. He settled about one mile south of Wassaic at a site that was later called the &quot;Steel Works&quot;, as furnace and foundry were established there during the Revolution to manufacture steel for the use of the army. There was a forge at that location as early as 1770.

In 1724 Captain Garret Winegar (Winnegar) came to Amenia Union from East Camp in Columbia County, New York. The Winegars were among the Palatine families from the Middle Rhine that had settled in the Province of New York in 1710 under the sponsorship of Queen Anne. A second Palatine family, that of Johannes Rouh (Rowe), came to Hitchcock&#x27;s Corner (Amenia Union) sometime prior to 1731. Samuel Hitchcock, for whom the hamlet was named, arrived in about 1757. Dr. Thomas Young lived at the &quot;Corner&quot; for several years and married a daughter of Captain Winegar. The town was named by Young, derived from Latin and meaning &quot;pleasant to the eye&quot;.

The house of worship known as the &quot;Red Meeting House&quot; was built in 1758, and stood about a mile northeast of the village of Amenia. George Whitefield preached there in the summer of 1770. The Precinct of Amenia was established by act of the colonial legislature in 1762.

In the summer of 1778, a large number of prisoners - mostly Hessians, taken at the battle of Saratoga the year before - were marched through the town on their way to Fishkill Landing, where they crossed the Hudson. It is said that some of the Hessian soldiers solicited the people to aid them in escaping; a few succeeded, and remained in this country. 

Jacob Bockee, a captain in the company in Col. Willet&#x27;s Regiment, was a member of the Assembly in 1795 and 1797, where he introduced a bill for the abolition of slavery in the state. Most of the slaves in the town were manumitted in the manner and under the conditions prescribed by law. Owners were not permitted to make free and cast off any slave who was not capable of providing for himself. In 1824, three years before the institutional abolition of slavery in the state, there were 32 slaves in Amenia.

About the year 1812, a company was organized in this town for the manufacture of woolen goods, styled as the &quot;Amenia Manufacturing Company&quot; and owned by the Barker, Benton, Ingraham, Park, and Canfield families. Its factory was located on the banks of Webatuck Creek at Leedsville.

Amenia was officially named a town, in separation from the eponymous precinct, in 1788.

<text>Fishkill is a village within the town of Fishkill in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The village is in the eastern part of the town of Fishkill on U.S. Route 9. It is north of Interstate 84. NY 52 is the main street. It is part of the PoughkeepsieNewburghMiddletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New YorkNewarkBridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area. The first U. S. Post Office in New York state was established in Fishkill by Samuel Loudon, its first Postmaster.

==History== 
Fishkill is located in the former territory of the Wappinger people. It was part of the Rombout Patent granted to Francis Rombouts, Gulian VerPlanck, and Stephanus Van Cortlandt of New Amsterdam in 1685. The name &quot;Fishkill&quot; evolved from two Dutch words, &#x27; (fish) and &#x27; (stream or creek). In 1714, Dutch immigrants settled in the area. The village of Fishkill was a significant crossroads in the overland transportation network in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Queen&#x27;s Highway, connecting Albany to New York City, intersected with a major overland route from New England to the Hudson River. Among the first to occupy the land now within the village limits were Johannes Ter Boss and Henry Rosecrance.

During the American Revolution printer Samuel Loudon fled from New York City during the British occupation of that city and set up a post office in Fishkill, which became the first post office in New York state. Here Loudon also continued printing a revolutionary newspaper called, &quot;The New York Packet and The American Advertiser&quot; which he founded while in New York City.

The third New York Provincial Congress convened in Fishkill in May 1776. Fishkill became part of one of the largest colonial military encampments during the Revolutionary War. General Washington&#x27;s aide-de-camp Alexander Hamilton took residence here. The Trinity Church, on Hopewell Avenue in the village, was organized in 1756 and the structure built in 1760. It was used as a hospital during the Revolutionary War. The Dutch Reformed church was used as a military prison. American spy Enoch Crosby was held there briefly with Loyalist recruits before being allowed to escape.

In 1871, construction began for a schoolhouse on Church Street. The site used for the schoolhouse belonged to the Fishkill Reformed Church and was formerly used as pasture land for the pastor&#x27;s cow. In 1876, a great fire destroyed many of the old wooden buildings, which were then replaced by brick ones.

In 1996, the animal rights group PETA (led by the organization&#x27;s president at the time, Jack Earnhardt) suggested the town (and, presumably, the village, as well) change its name to something less suggestive of violence toward fish. The town declined this change because the name is not meant to suggest violence but instead comes from the Dutch who originally settled the land in which &quot;&quot; means &quot;creek&quot;. Various other communities also contain the word &quot;&quot; with various prefixes, and a creek in the Catskills called Beaver Kill is a tributary of the Delaware River. Both &quot;Catskill&quot; and &quot;Beaver Kill&quot; could be considered to promote animal violence when their names are improperly understood. This led then-mayor George Carter to joke that if Fishkill is renamed, the Catskills should also be renamed, presumably to the Catsave Mountains.

==Geography==

<text>Fishkill is a town in the southwestern part of Dutchess County, New York, United States. It lies approximately north of New York City. The population was 24,226 at the 2010 census. Fishkill surrounds the city of Beacon, and contains a village, which is also named Fishkill.

The name Fishkill derives from the Dutch words &quot;vis kill&quot;, meaning &quot;fish creek&quot;. The location of Fishkill was known as &quot;Tioranda&quot; by the Native American peoples. The name means &quot;The place where two waters meet&quot;. Fishkill is one of the nine original towns in Dutchess County, and is best known today for its rich history dating to the American Revolutionary War period and scenic views of the Hudson Highlands.

==History==
In 1683, New York City merchants Francis Rombouts and Gulian Verplanck purchased in Dutchess County from the Wappinger confederacy of Native Americans for a quantity of goods including rum, powder, and tobacco. In 1685 it was granted as the royal Rombout Patent. Neither ever lived on the land, intending to use it only for fur trading. The first white settlers were Rombout&#x27;s daughter, Catheryna, and her husband, Roger Brett, who built a mill at the mouth of Fishkill Creek as it flows into the Hudson River.

Originally, the boundaries of Fishkill extended far beyond the boundaries of the present-day Town of Fishkill. When the town was incorporated in 1788, Fishkill&#x27;s land area included the present-day City of Beacon and Village of Fishkill, as well as the Town of Wappinger, Village of Wappingers Falls, Town of East Fishkill and a portion of the Town of LaGrange. During the 19th century, as other towns incorporated, Fishkill&#x27;s area was reduced until the incorporation of the City of Beacon in 1913 resulted in Town boundaries approximate to modern town lines.

A number of areas within the town retain their Native American names, including Matteawan Road and the hamlet of Wiccopee, which overlaps into the modern town of East Fishkill. Daniel Nimham, the final sachem of the Wappinger people, was born in the Wiccopee area in 1726.

Fishkill played a pivotal role in the American Revolutionary War when a huge military encampment known as the Fishkill Supply Depot was established one mile (1.6Â km) south of the village of Fishkill to guard the mountain pass to the south. Signal fires lay in readiness on tops of the surrounding mountains. The Fishkill encampment became the main supply depot for the northern department of the Continental Army. The first copies of the New York State Constitution were printed at Fishkill in 1777. Mount Beacon, located in the town, earned its name for the signal fires at the summit which were used for Continental Army communications during the war.

As commander of the Continental Army, George Washington spent considerable time in Fishkill, and in 1778, noted Fishkill silversmith John Bailey crafted a sword for Washington near present-day Maurer-Geering Park. The sword was a particular favorite of Washington&#x27;s, and he carried it for the remainder of the war. Upon his death, Washington bequeathed a sword to each of his five nephews, and nephew Samuel Washington received the Bailey sword. He donated it to Congress in 1843. The sword now lies in the Smithsonian Institution, as part of the National Museum of American History.

Today, the town&#x27;s economy is diverse, comprising tourism, medical care, retail and restaurants, warehouses, recreation spots and a wealth of small businesses.

In 1996, the animal rights group PETA suggested the town change its name to something less suggestive of violence toward fish. The name derives from the Dutch &quot;vis kill&quot;, meaning &quot;fish creek.&quot; For this reason, the town declined. 

In 2021, the Town commissioned an eight-foot bronze statue depicting Daniel Nimham from noted Hudson Valley sculptor Michael Keropian. The statue was installed at the Arrowhead intersection of NY-52 and NY-82 (41Â° 32.685â² N, 73Â° 52.16â² W.) in May 2022 and dedicated on June 11, 2022. Town Supervisor Ozzy Albra hosted the ceremony which featured comments from elected officials, educators, the sculptor, and a number of special presentations by Native American community groups.

==Government==

The Town of Fishkill is overseen by a Town Supervisor a Town Council, comprising four Councilmembers. The Town Supervisor and Town Council are elected to four-year terms, and town law limits the Town Supervisor and Town Council to two terms of service. As of 2024, the Town Supervisor is Ozzy Albra, and the Town Council consists of John Forman, Greg Totino and Brian Wrye.

==Tourism==
Fishkill is home to a number of tourist locations, including a number of historically significant sites. Popular sites include:

* Dutchess Stadium, home of the Hudson Valley Renegades Minor League Baseball team
*Mount Gulian
*SplashDown Beach, a seasonal water and amusement park
* Stony Kill Farm
* Van Wyck Homestead Museum
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 14.55%, is water. The elevation of the town varies from sea level along the Hudson River (Fishkill Waterfront, Fishkill Landing, Dutchess Junction) to above sea level (South Beacon Mountain).

The southern town line is the border between Dutchess and Putnam counties and between the towns of Fishkill and Philipstown. The western town line is defined by the Hudson River, across which lie the Orange County towns of Cornwall, New Windsor, and Newburgh, as well as the city of Newburgh. The city of Beacon is contained within the town, though Fishkill&#x27;s area west of Beacon is mostly occupied by the Hudson. To the north is the town of Wappinger, and to the east is the town of East Fishkill.

The town&#x27;s namesake, the Fishkill Creek, runs from east to west across the town and empties into the Hudson River. As the word Fishkill derives from the Dutch &quot;vis kill&quot;, meaning &quot;fish creek,&quot; the English use of &quot;Fishkill Creek&quot; creates a bilingual tautology.

Interstate 84 passes through the town in an east-west direction, with access from Exits 41, 44, and 46 and US 9 passes through both the town and village of Fishkill in a north-south direction.

<text>Pawling is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. Its population was 8,012 at the 2020 census. The town is named after Catherine Pauling, the daughter of Henry Beekman, who held the second largest land patent in the county. The town is in the southeastern part of the county, and contains a village of the same name.

==History==
A part of the town was involved in a boundary problem involving New York and Connecticut. A section of the town, located in the &quot;Oblong&quot;âthe name was given to the disputed oblong strip of land, two miles in width forming part of the Eastern boundary of the now Dutchess and Putnam Countiesâwas settled by Nathan Birdsall and his wife Jane Langdon; they were the first pioneer settlers of Quaker Hill, Dutchess, NY. He was a native of Long Island and was born around 1700 to Quaker parents. He was one of the surveyors of the area and picked his home site during the survey.

Nathan purchased his land from the Great Nine Partners Patent, prior to moving his family there, erected a log house and barn, probably around 1720. The next settler was Benjamin Ferris, a Quaker preacher. It was not until 1731, when the one-hundred-year-old dispute as to the boundary between the English in New England and the Dutch in New York was settled, that emigration started in any volume. A number of Friends began coming from Harrisons Purchase, now a part of Rye, in Westchester County, New York. Their Quaker Meeting House is still standing today, and open for visitors.

In the American Revolution colonial commander in chief George Washington established his headquarters at the John Kane House in the town (now the village) for two months in 1778. The town was founded in 1788, but part of the town was used to form the neighboring town of Dover in 1807. The town of Pawling was part of the Beekman Patent, a large land grant to Col. Henry Beekman in 1697.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (1.80%) is water.

The eastern and western section of the towns are high and hilly, with the Great Swamp and Harlem Valley in the middle, where the village of Pawling is located. The highest elevation in town is Observatory Hill, at above sea level; the lowest is , in the Great Swamp, along the southern boundary of the town.

Most of the population of Pawling is concentrated in the valley, traversed by NY 22 (joined by NY 55 south of the village) and Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line. There are two train stations in town, the Pawling station in the village and the Appalachian Trail station, allowing passengers to hike that trail up into the Pawling Nature Reserve along Hammersby Ridge in the northern section of town.

The southern town line is the border of Putnam County, New York, and the eastern town boundary is the border of Connecticut. To the west lies the town of Beekman, with Dover to the north. It also shares a small border with the town of East Fishkill at the southwestern edge of the town.

<text>Pine Plains is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population was 2,218 at the 2020 census.

The name is derived from the geographic character of the region. The hamlet of Pine Plains is on the northern border of the county.

==History==
The town was part of the Little Nine Partners Patent of 1706. The town was first settled around 1740 by Moravian missionaries to the native Mahican village of Shekomeko. The town of Pine Plains was formed from the town of North East in 1823.

In the 1880s the town served as the winter-home for P.T. Barnum&#x27;s animals. This was due to the rural, non-urban nature of the town (fewer prying eyes), and proximity to many different railroad lines.

In 1907, Walter W. Law moved Briarcliff Farms from Briarcliff Manor, New York, to Pine Plains and sold the property in 1918. In 1916, New York banker Oakleigh Thorne and several business partners purchased large land parcels. They began breeding Angus cattle still in the name of Briarcliff Farm. The farm was broken up into several smaller farms in the late 1940s, and most lasted until the early 1980s, closing due to property taxes and poor economic conditions. Berkshire Stud purchased there, starting in 1983.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land, and , or 1.89%, is water. The northern town line is the border of Columbia County, with the towns of Gallatin and Ancram to the north. The town of North East borders the east, Stanford to the South and Milan to the west.

Three small lakes lie west of Pine Plain&#x27;s hamlet: Stissing Lake which is excellent for swimming, Thompson Pond which is dedicated to conservation for wildlife, and Twin Island Lake, known locally as &quot;Mud Pond&quot;. Stissing Mountain, the town&#x27;s highest point at , is immediately to the west. It is formed of Precambrian gneiss that remains after numerous glaciation cycles have scoured and reformed the surrounding terrain. The mountain itself is a permanent exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History, showcasing its unique formation and flora/fauna of the area.

==Land use==
In 2009, the town enacted its first zoning ordinance after protracted review, discussion and community input. The Comprehensive Plan was updated in 2021.

=== Carvel Farm ===

From 1920 into the 1970s, Stissing Lake was the site of the Stissing Lake camps (boys&#x27; facilities on the east side, girls&#x27; on the west). There an adolescent, Jerry Herman, son of the owners, honed his musical skills during the 1940s, leading many years later to his Tony award-winning shows &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, and other Broadway musicals such as the hit &quot;Mame&quot;. Pine Plains was the original home of Tri-Arts, located in the Carvel Theatre.

Starting in 2016, talk of major renovations to a large town building started. The building would come to be known as Memorial Hall. Originally built in 1915 and serving as a theater for silent films, then as a first-run cinema, as well as vaudeville shows. In 1975 after the original foundation ran out of money, it was reconfigured into a number of different shops. With many changes and overhauls, Memorial Hall morphed into The Stissing Center, with continuing renovations as of 2023.

In addition to several cattle farms, Pine Plains is also the home to many horse farms.

<text>Poughkeepsie ( ), officially the City of Poughkeepsie, which is separate from the Town of Poughkeepsie around it, is a city in the U.S. state of New York. It is the county seat of Dutchess County, with a 2020 census population of 31,577. Poughkeepsie is in the Hudson River Valley region, midway between the core of the New York metropolitan area and the state capital of Albany. It is a principal city of the Kiryas JoelâPoughkeepsieâNewburgh metropolitan area which belongs to the New York combined statistical area. It is served by the nearby Hudson Valley Regional Airport and Stewart International Airport in Orange County, New York.

Poughkeepsie has been called &quot;The Queen City of the Hudson&quot;. It was settled in the 17th century by the Dutch and became New York State&#x27;s second capital shortly after the American Revolution. It was chartered as a city in 1854. Major bridges in the city include the Walkway over the Hudson, a former railroad bridge called the Poughkeepsie Bridge which reopened as a public walkway on October 3, 2009; and the Mid-Hudson Bridge, a major thoroughfare built in 1930 that carries U.S. Route 44 over the Hudson. The city of Poughkeepsie lies in New York&#x27;s 18th congressional district.

The City of Poughkeepsie and neighboring Town of Poughkeepsie are generally viewed as a single place and are commonly referred to collectively as &quot;Poughkeepsie&quot;, with a combined population of 77,048 in 2020.

Poughkeepsie is situated between the Lower Hudson and the Capital District regions, and the city&#x27;s economy is stimulated by several major corporations, including IBM. Educational institutions include Marist College, Vassar College, Dutchess Community College and The Culinary Institute of America.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Poughkeepsie&quot; is derived from a word in the Wappinger tribe&#x27;s Munsee language, roughly , meaning &#x27;the reed-covered lodge by the little-water place&#x27;, referring to a spring or stream feeding into the Hudson River south of the downtown area.

==History==
English colonist Robert Sanders and Dutch colonist Myndert Harmense Van Den Bogaerdt acquired the land from a local Native American tribe in 1686, and the first settlers were the families of Barent Baltus Van Kleeck and Hendrick Jans van Oosterom. The settlement grew quickly, and the Reformed Church of Poughkeepsie was established by 1720.

The city of Poughkeepsie was spared from battle during the American Revolutionary War and became the second capital of the State of New York after Kingston was burned by the British. In 1788, the Ratification Convention for New York State included Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and George Clinton. They assembled at the courthouse on Market Street and ratified the United States Constitution, and New York State entered the new union as the eleventh of the original Thirteen Colonies to become the United States. In 1799, a new seal was created for the city.

The community was set off from the town of Poughkeepsie when it became an incorporated village on March 27, 1799. The city of Poughkeepsie was chartered on March 28, 1854.

Poughkeepsie was a major center for whale rendering, and the industry flourished during the 19th century through shipping, millineries, paper mills, and several breweries along the Hudson River, including some owned by Matthew Vassar, founder of Vassar College. Wealthy families such as the Astors, Rogers, and Vanderbilts, built palatial weekend homes nearby due to the area&#x27;s natural beauty and proximity to New York City. The Vanderbilt Mansion is located several miles up the Hudson from Poughkeepsie in the town of Hyde Park and is registered as a national historic site; it is considered to be a sterling example of the mansions built by American industrialists during the late 19th century. Locust Grove, the former home of Samuel F.B. Morse, the inventor of the telegraph, is nearby. The city is home to the Bardavon 1869 Opera House, the oldest continuously operating entertainment venue in the state.

==Geography==
The city of Poughkeepsie is located on the western edge of Dutchess County, in Downstate New York&#x27;s Hudson River Valley Area.

It is bordered by the town of Lloyd across the Hudson River to the west and by the town of Poughkeepsie on the north, east and south. There are two crossings of the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie: the Mid-Hudson Bridge for motor vehicles and pedestrians, and the pedestrian Walkway over the Hudson.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land, and (comprising 10.05%) is water. Poughkeepsie lies approximately north of the center of the New York megacity. It is south of the New York state capital of Albany. The highest elevation of Poughkeepsie is above sea level on College Hill. Its lowest is on the Hudson River.

Poughkeepsie makes up a part of the Kiryas JoelâPoughkeepsieâNewburgh metropolitan statistical area, which is a part of the wider NY-NJ-CT combined statistical area.

As of 2020, the dominant industries in Poughkeepsie are healthcare, retail, education, science and technology, finance, and manufacturing. The arts community is part of the current wave or revitalization in Poughkeepsie with creative people moving from New York City and elsewhere, affectionately called &quot;Poughkipsters.&quot; 

IBM has a large campus in the adjacent town of Poughkeepsie. It was once referred to as IBM&#x27;s &quot;Main Plant&quot;, although much of the workforce has been moved elsewhere in the company (2008). The site once built the IBM 700/7000 series of computers as well as the IBM 7030 Stretch computer and later, together with the Endicott site, IBM mainframes. The RS/6000 SP2 family of computers, which came to fame after one of them won a chess match against world chess master Garry Kasparov, were also manufactured by IBM Poughkeepsie. In October 2008, IBM&#x27;s Poughkeepsie facility was named &quot;Assembly Plant of the Year 2008&quot; by the editors of &quot;Assembly Magazine&quot;. Poughkeepsie remains IBM&#x27;s primary design and manufacturing center for its newest mainframes and high-end Power Systems servers, and it is also one of IBM&#x27;s major software development centers for z/OS and for other products.

Until 1972, Poughkeepsie was home to the Smith Brothers cough drop factory. The Smith Brothers&#x27; gravesite is in the Poughkeepsie Rural Cemetery.

The Hudson Valley Hawks were a team in the National Professional Basketball League until 2009 when the league disbanded. The team&#x27;s home court was at Beacon High School, located approximately south in the city of Beacon.

The Hudson Valley Highlanders of the North American Football League played their home games at Dietz Stadium in nearby Kingston.

Poughkeepsie hosted a founding member of the North Eastern Hockey League with the formation of the Poughkeepsie Panthers in 2003. However, due to financial problems, the team only played for one season and became the Connecticut Cougars the following year. The league folded due to financial problems in January 2008. Subsequently, the city was home to the Hudson Valley Bears, one of four founding members of the Eastern Professional Hockey League, for one season. Both teams played their home games at the McCann Ice Arena in the Mid-Hudson Civic Center.
One of Poughkeepsie&#x27;s most notable sports events was the annual Poughkeepsie Regatta of the Intercollegiate Rowing Association, which was held on the Hudson River from 1895 to 1949. The top college teams would attend along with tens of thousands of spectators. Poughkeepsie was known as the rowing capital of the world. Spectators watched from the hills and bluffs overlooking the river and from chartered boats and trains that followed the races along the entire length of the course; which were longer than present-day races, with varsity eights rowing a race. When the rowing association moved the regatta to other venues, the Mid-Hudson Rowing Association was formed to preserve rowing in the area. It successfully lobbied to preserve the regatta&#x27;s facilities for use by area high schools and club rowing programs. As part of the 400th anniversary celebration of Henry Hudson&#x27;s trip up the Hudson River a recreation of the regatta was held with Marist College Crew as its host. The events included a fireworks display, a large dinner, and the unveiling of the restored historic Cornell Boathouse, now property of Marist Crew. Historically accurate, the four mile long course started off Rogers Point in Hyde Park and ended about a mile south of the Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge. Competitors included Marist, Vassar, Army, Penn, Navy, Syracuse, Columbia and Cornell. Notably this was the first time women&#x27;s crew teams were allowed to participate in the historic Poughkeepsie Regatta.

The Poughkeepsie Bridge opened in 1889 to carry railroad traffic across the Hudson, the usage of the bridge came to an end when a 1974 fire damaged its decking. A local group (Walkway over the Hudson) raised the funds to convert the bridge into a unique linear park connecting rail-trails on both sides of the Hudson River. The Walkway Over The Hudson opened on October 3, 2009, coinciding with the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson&#x27;s first exploration of the river named for him.

<text>Poughkeepsie ( ), officially the Town of Poughkeepsie, is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 45,471. The name is derived from the native compound Uppuqui-ipis-ing, from &quot;Uppuqui&quot; ( ) meaning &quot;lodge-covered&quot;, plus &quot;ipis&quot; meaning &quot;little water&quot;, plus &quot;ing&quot; meaning &quot;place&quot;, all of which translates to &quot;the reed-covered lodge by the little water place&quot;. This later evolved into &quot;Apokeepsing&quot;, then into &quot;Poughkeepsing&quot;, and finally &quot;Poughkeepsie&quot;.

The area includes a large IBM campus noted for its ongoing development and manufacturing of IBM mainframes.

==History==

The town was first settled &quot;circa&quot; 1780 and was part of the Schuyler Patent of 1788. The town of Poughkeepsie was established in 1788 as part of a general organization of towns in the county. In 1854, part of the western section of the town, already an independent village, became the city of Poughkeepsie. At least two National Historic Landmarks are located in the town: the Vassar College Observatory and the Main Building of Vassar College.

The Hudson River, which marks the boundary of the Ulster County towns of Lloyd and Marlborough and the Orange County town of Newburgh, forms the majority of the western border of the town. The City of Poughkeepsie occupies the remainder of the town&#x27;s western border. The town is bordered by Hyde Park to the north, Pleasant Valley to the northeast, LaGrange to the east, and Wappinger to the southeast.

<text>Red Hook is a town in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population was 9,953 at the time of the 2020 census, down from 11,319 in 2010. The name is supposedly derived from the red foliage on trees on a small strip of land on the Hudson River The town contains two villages, Red Hook and Tivoli. The town is in the northwest part of Dutchess County.

The town also contains two hamlets. Bard College is in the hamlet of Annandale-on-Hudson. The Unification Theological Seminary is in the hamlet of Barrytown. Both hamlets are located within the Hudson River Historic District.

== History ==
The original inhabitants of this land were the Mohican, Munsee and Lenape people. During European settlement, Native American tribes played a fundamental role in the area&#x27;s economy as they traded beaver skin with European settlers. European settlers imported several foreign goods, such as cattle, horses, and sheep. Enslaved African American individuals were also brought. 
Through importing non-native species, the landscape and ecology of this region has been dramatically changed.

European settler-colonial understandings of land-ownership are different from the perspectives of Mohican, Munsee and Lenape land use, a difference not often reflected in the land deeds that establish European presence on this land. The Lenape believed that &quot;KishelÃ«mukÃ²ng&quot; had created the earth for all people and creatures, meaning that land could not be appropriated by any individual or despoiled for personal profit. In this way, this group of people did not understand the process of selling land but believed they would receive continued access to it to hunt, fish, forage, or even plant crops. Through Schuyler&#x27;s Patent, Dutch settler Peter Schuyler acquired two tracts of land from unidentified native peoples, âone near Red Hook and one south of Poughkeepsieâ in 1688. One of the three place-names identified in Schuyler&#x27;s Patent is given in the Munsee language.

Prior to 1812, Red Hook was part of the town of Rhinebeck. Because Rhinebeck, as well other towns, had populations over 5,000 residents, the state legislature authorized the separation of these two precincts on June 12 to accommodate and encourage public attendance at town meetings via horseback or carriage. The first documented Town of Red Hook meeting was on April 6, 1813, in a local inn and held yearly afterwards as required by law. Wealthy landowning farmers oversaw the maintenance of their assigned roads with the help of their farm workers and neighbors. The Red Hook Society for the Apprehension and Detention of Horse Thieves is thought to be one of the oldest formal organizations in the state and still holds an annual meeting.

==Geography==

Prior to European settlement, the land surrounding the Mahicannituck, or the Hudson River, included âforested hills, meadows, and tributary streamsâ. This landscape of the river, as well as the surrounding land, was often portrayed in a romanticized, naturalized fashion to depict an American âwildernessâ that was devoid of Indigenous presence to further narratives of European exploration of the Americas. This same landscape was described in small detail in Hendrick Aupaumutâs written account of the Native history of the Mohicans in 1791, showing that Native people enjoyed this same landscape prior to these settlersâ arrival. Upon their arrival, settlers changed this landscape through the building of grist mills, sawmills, a carding machine, a trip hammer, and a distillery in 1797. Other more contemporary examples of the change in the geography of the town of Red Hook include the development of Tivoli North Bay and Stony Creek watershed as well as the Tivoli South Bay and the Saw Kill watershed. European settlement did not always cause environmental change but it may or may not have altered the rate at which environmental change naturally occurs.

The Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans have identified Dutchess County, which includes Red Hook, as an area of archeological interest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town currently has a total area of , of which is land and , or 9.67%, is water. The northern town line is the border of Columbia County. The western town boundary is the border of Ulster County and is delineated by the center of the Hudson River.

== Education ==
The town of Red Hook has its own school district (which also includes part of the neighboring towns of Milan and Livingston). Grades pre-kindergarten to five attend the Mill Road Elementary School, grades 6â8 attend the Linden Avenue Middle School, and grades 9â12 attend the Red Hook High School.
Over 80% of its graduates go on to two and four-year colleges.

Bard College (nee St. Stephen&#x27;s College), established, 1860, is a private college in the hamlet of Annandale-on-Hudson with undergraduate and graduate programs.

==Culture==
Bard College has various components that are open to the general public.
*Bard Conservatory of Music, events at Fisher Center for the Performing Arts.
*Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities.
*Hessel Museum of Art at Bard College.

<text>Rhinebeck is a village in the town of Rhinebeck in Dutchess County, New York, United States. The population was 2,657 at the 2010 census. It is part of the PoughkeepsieâNewburghâMiddletown, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area as well as the larger New YorkâNewarkâConnecticut.

The postal ZIP code is 12572. U.S. Route 9 passes through the village.
==History==
=== Native American presence ===
The Sepasco band of Native Americans lived in the area of today&#x27;s Rhinebeck at the time white colonists arrived. Sepasco/Sepascot is derived from the word &quot;sepuus,&quot; which means little river or stream, and refers to the Landman&#x27;s Kill stream whose &quot;cot&quot; or &quot;coot&quot;, meaning mouth, opens onto the southwestern shoreline of present-day Rhinebeck. This was the watershed of the Sepascos.

The Sepasco tribe had established a fertile stretch of land as a trail or tract leading from what is currently White School House Road to what later became the Rock City Community, east of where the village of Rhinebeck is now. A stopping point on the trail must have been a spring located there, that then led to the Landman&#x27;s Kill stream and followed it to the east, along the north bank. The trail continued to a native village at what is currently known as Lake Sepasco, close in proximity to the cave later called Welch&#x27;s Cave.

=== Colonial settlement ===
European settlement in the Rhinebeck area dates to 1686, when a group of Dutch crossed the river from Kingston and bought of land from three members of the local Sepasco tribe. Later, Henry Beekman obtained a patent for the land and saw a need for development to begin. He brought into the area Casper Landsman, a miller, and William Traphagen, a builder. In 1703, the New York colonial assembly approved money for the construction of the King&#x27;s Highway, later known as the Albany Post Road and today most of Route 9. Three years later Traphagen bought a tract of land in Beekman&#x27;s patent where the King&#x27;s Highway intersected the Sepasco Indian Trail, the route today followed by Market Street. He built a house and tavern on the trail a short distance west of the King&#x27;s Highway. This was the beginning of Rhinebeck.

A decade later, in 1715, Beekman&#x27;s son brought in 35 German Palatines who had fled religious persecution at home and had just concluded an attempt to produce naval stores for the British government on the lands of Robert Livingston to the north in what is now Columbia County. The village grew with the new arrivals. New trades established themselves, and in 1733 the Reformed Dutch Church was built. Its first building was on the site of its current one at Mill and South streets. In 1766 the beginnings of the current Beekman Inn were erected. It has remained in operation as a hotel ever since.

In the mid-1770s, a former soldier named Richard Montgomery moved from Knight&#x27;s Bridge (now the Bronx) into the Rhinebeck village with his new wife, a member of the Livingston family. He had just begun to settle into life as a farmer when the American Revolution began. After being elected to the New York Provincial Congress, he was commissioned a general in the Continental Army, and died at the end of 1775 in the Battle of Quebec. Montgomery&#x27;s cottage still stands, although it was moved to 77 Livingston Street, where it houses the local Daughters of the American Revolution chapter; the street it was on was later named in his honor.

After independence from Britain the village continued to grow. The town of Rhinebeck, which contains the village, was organized in 1788. The current Dutch Reformed Church was built in 1802, making it the oldest church in the village. The current route of East Market Street was laid out the same year during construction of the Ulster-Saulsbury Turnpike, later to become Route 308. Rhinebeck continued to attract politicians. George Washington visited in 1796, dining at Bogardus&#x27;s, the second Traphagen Tavern, when he stayed at a nearby friend&#x27;s house. During the 1804 gubernatorial election, both Aaron Burr and Morgan Lewis used taverns in Rhinebeck as campaign headquarters.

The village was incorporated in 1834. Ten years later, Alexander Jackson Davis built the Henry Delamater House at 44 Montgomery Street. It still stands today, one of the best examples in the area of the early use of the Gothic Revival style in American residential architecture.

By the 1850s, Rhinebeck had grown even further and acquired a reputation as a woodworking center. The town&#x27;s name on milled products was a symbol of quality, and its furniture was shipped as far away as South Carolina. It was said to have no better in making carriages, coaches and sleighs. Some makers of clothing also achieved national prestige. The area was also acquiring a cachet as a location for the country estates of the Gilded Age wealthy, and those people could frequently be seen in town during the summer and on weekends.

In 1885, former congressman and ambassador to France Levi P. Morton settled in Bois Dore on Mill Street. Benjamin Harrison chose him to be his running mate on the 1888 Republican ticket. Harrison was visiting him in Rhinebeck later that year when word came to them that they had just been elected. Later, Morton would serve as governor of the state. He died there in 1920 and is buried in Rhinebeck Cemetery.

The end of the 19th century saw a new industry center on Rhinebeck: the cultivation of violets. Roughly 20% of the village&#x27;s population during the Gay Nineties was in this business in some way, and the total crop was later estimated to have exceeded a million dollars in value some years. Several of the &quot;violet houses&quot; built during this era survive and are located in the district.

An 1890 map of the village shows it as nearly coterminous with today&#x27;s historic district. That area has remained mostly as it was at that time. A third president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, himself a native of nearby Hyde Park, would play a role in the town&#x27;s history during the later years of the Great Depression when he oversaw the design process for the new post office. He had long promoted Dutch-style fieldstone as a material for public buildings in the area, and told the architects to use Henry Beekman&#x27;s house (burned in a 1910 fire) as their model and some of its remaining stones for the post office. He spoke at the dedication ceremony and helped lay the cornerstone. The oldest building in the village is the Benner House, built in 1739.

The Wilderstein mansion, a current historical site on the Hudson River, features both colonial and archaeological history dating from June 1853. &quot;Wilderstein&quot;, named by Thomas Suckley and his wife Catherine Murray Bowne and which translates to &quot;wild man&#x27;s stone&quot;, references a petroglyph from local Sepasco or Esopus peoples on the property, serving as a historical reminder of pre-European settlement.

<text>Elizabeth Ann Hulette (November 19, 1960 â May 1, 2003), best known in professional wrestling circles as Miss Elizabeth, was an American professional wrestling manager, occasional professional wrestler and professional wrestling TV announcer. She gained international fame from 1985 to 1992 in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and from 1996 to 2000 in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), in her role as the manager to wrestler &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, as well as other wrestlers of that period.

==Early life==
Hulette was born in Frankfort, Kentucky. She graduated from Franklin County High School and the University of Kentucky with a degree in communications.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== International Championship Wrestling (1983â1985) ===
While working at a gym, she met Randy Poffo, who wrestled under the ring name &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. They married in December 1984.

Later Hulette worked at International Championship Wrestling shows as a TV announcer where Poffo was employed.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1985â1992) ===

==== Managing Randy Savage (1985â1988) ====
On June 17, 1985, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage debuted in the World Wrestling Federation. At that time, the WWF featured an angle in which all the managers in the promotion competed to offer their services to Savage. During a match on July 30, 1985, in Poughkeepsie, New York, several managers were at ringside in hopes that he would name one of them as his new manager. After the match, Savage thanked the managers for their consideration and then asked that his new manager come to ringside. An attractive, unnamed woman then came down to the ring, and announcer Jesse Ventura remarked, &quot;She must be some sort of movie star,&quot; referring to her glamorous sex appeal. It was later revealed that her name was &quot;Miss Elizabeth&quot;. Elizabeth&#x27;s WWF debut was taped on July 30, 1985, and aired on the August 24, 1985 edition of &quot;WWF Prime Time Wrestling&quot;. From that point on, she was the manager of Randy Savage. On February 8, 1986, at the Boston Garden she was in Savage&#x27;s corner as he defeated Tito Santana for the WWF Intercontinental Championship.
Miss Elizabeth&#x27;s first major angle was during Savage&#x27;s feud with George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele in 1986. In the angle, Steele fell in love with Elizabeth, angering Savage and leading to a series of grudge matches between him and Steele. Their feud was one of the WWF&#x27;s most popular of the 1980s; it carried on for more than a year, thanks to the feral Steele&#x27;s continued innocent crush on Elizabeth.

After &quot;injuring&quot; Ricky Steamboat&#x27;s larynx, Savage lost his WWF Intercontinental Championship to Steamboat at WrestleMania III on March 29, 1987. Steamboat later lost the title to The Honky Tonk Man, whose insistence that he was &quot;the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time&quot; instigated a challenge from Savage, the former champion. In their match, which aired on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XII&quot; in September 1987, Honky shoved Elizabeth to the mat before assaulting Savage with a guitar. Elizabeth ran backstage and persuaded Hulk Hogan to rescue Savage, running off Honky and his allies, Bret &quot;The Hitman&quot; Hart and Jim &quot;The Anvil&quot; Neidhart. Throughout the Savage-Honky feud, a key point was Honky&#x27;s claim that Elizabeth secretly wanted him more than Savage. In several of their matches, Honky would try to corner Elizabeth, although Savage would always beat him back. In other Savage-Honky matches, a woman named &quot;Peggy Sue&quot; (usually Sherri Martel, or a dressed-up Jimmy &quot;Mouth of the South&quot; Hart) would harass Elizabeth at ringside, creating an advantage for Honky. At the 1987 Slammy Awards, Honky named Elizabeth &quot;Woman of the Year,&quot; but the honor was only to harass her and anger Savage; Savage quickly ran Honky off.

In February 1988, Hulk Hogan, who had been the champion and the foundation upon which the WWF&#x27;s popularity was built, lost the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to AndrÃ© the Giant. AndrÃ© then sold the belt to the &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase due to an arrangement that they had prior to the match. President Jack Tunney declared that the title cannot be forfeited to another individual. A tournament was held at WrestleMania IV to declare a new champion, which Macho Man Randy Savage won, pinning DiBiase in the finals. Throughout mid-1988, Elizabeth accompanied Savage to ringside for his lengthy series of title defences against DiBiase.

==== Mega Powers (1988â1989) ====
At the inaugural SummerSlam event in August 1988, Savage and Hulk Hogan - dubbed the &quot;Mega Powers&quot; - teamed up against the Mega Bucks (AndrÃ© the Giant and Ted DiBiase) with Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura. Most of the pre-match build-up centered on Elizabeth, who by this time was at the peak of her popularity. The tease for the match was that if things got bad, Elizabeth, billed as the secret weapon of The Mega Powers, was going to wear an &quot;itsy bitsy teeny weeny bikini&quot; under her fancy clothes. Towards the end of match, AndrÃ© and DiBiase were in control, so Elizabeth got up on the apron and ripped her skirt off to reveal her panties which distracted AndrÃ©, DiBiase and Ventura, giving Savage and Hogan time to recover after being knocked out of the ring.

Elizabeth became the catalyst in the uneasy â and ultimate breakup of â the SavageâHogan relationship, particularly due to Hogan&#x27;s overfriendly, overprotective attitude toward Elizabeth. At his behest, Elizabeth accompanied Hogan to ringside for several matches during the fall of 1988, including matches against King Haku, Akeem, and Bad News Brown that aired on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XVII&quot;. In the match against Akeem, Elizabeth&#x27;s safety was endangered by Akeem and his allies, Slick and Akeem&#x27;s tag team partner, Big Boss Man when they began stalking Elizabeth. During a climactic point in the match where Hogan was being brutally beaten by Akeem, Big Boss Man grabbed Elizabeth and placed her in handcuffs, stopped only when Savage ran out to make the save; although he checked on Elizabeth&#x27;s well-being, Savage appeared to be unconcerned about Hogan.

Concurrent with the Mega Powers&#x27; feud with the Twin Towers was Savage&#x27;s feud with Bad News Brown. That feud started when Brown, during a guest appearance on &quot;The Brother Love Show&quot; talk segment, alleged that Elizabeth was &quot;doing favors&quot; for WWF President Jack Tunney (implying she wanted to protect Savage and his WWF World Heavyweight Championship reign from Brown). Savage quickly got revenge against Brown.

The tension between Hogan and Savage continued to build at the 1989 Royal Rumble when Hogan &quot;accidentally&quot; eliminated Savage. An angered Savage then confronted Hogan in the ring, causing Elizabeth to rush to the ring to play the role of peacemaker. After the match was over, Jesse Ventura interviewed Savage and claimed he could see problems between the Mega Powers, something Savage unconvincingly denied.

Meanwhile, tension continued to build within the Mega Powers, and on &quot;The Main Event II&quot;, aired live on February 3, 1989, Savage could no longer contain his growing anger toward Hogan. The sequence of events began when Akeem threw Savage onto Elizabeth, who was knocked unconscious from the force of the blow. Hogan immediately ran to Elizabeth&#x27;s aid and, distraught and fearing the worst, carried her to the backstage area for medical attention; the match continued in the meantime, with Akeem and Big Boss Man working Savage over. Elizabeth eventually regained consciousness and asked Hogan to return to the ring. However, Savage, furious over being left to take a beating, slapped Hogan in the face and, after having some choice words, left him to face the Twin Towers alone (Hogan went on to win the match single handed). Following the match, Savage and Hogan had a loud verbal argument backstage while Elizabeth was receiving medical attention, which culminated with Savage striking Hogan with the championship belt and beating him down, thus splitting the Mega Powers.

The dissolution of the Mega Powers led Hogan to challenge Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship in the main event of WrestleMania V in April 1989. In the build-up to the event, Savage appeared in a series of televised promos accusing Hogan of &quot;lusting after Elizabeth&quot; with video footage of past incidents, edited in a context to push Hogan as a jealous, sore heel. Hogan responded by defending his behavior (with more complete footage from the same incidents, to push him as the face). After weeks of speculation as to whose corner she would stand in at WrestleMania V, Elizabeth announced she would stand in a &quot;neutral&quot; corner. During the Hogan-Savage match, Elizabeth got in the way of both wrestlers several times and was eventually sent from ringside; Hogan went on to win Savage&#x27;s WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Following WrestleMania V, Savage ended his partnership with Miss Elizabeth, adopting Sensational Sherri as his new manager.

==== Rivalry with Randy Savage (1989â1990) ====
For the remainder of 1989, Elizabeth&#x27;s appearances were sporadic. She continued to mainly appear on the house show circuit managing Hulk Hogan in his matches with Randy Savage from April 1989 through October 1989. Elizabeth appeared at SummerSlam 1989, managing Hogan and Brutus Beefcake as they headlined the show against Savage and Zeus (accompanied by Sensational Sherri); Elizabeth, who rarely became physical with other wrestlers beforehand, tripped Sherri to prevent her from interfering at a critical point in the match. Elizabeth closed out 1989 managing Jim Duggan in his matches against Randy Savage and appearing on the &quot;Brother Love Show&quot; during house shows with Sherri Martel in November and December 1989. In addition to her appearances at ringside, Elizabeth also briefly co-hosted &quot;WWF Wrestling Spotlight&quot; with Vince McMahon.

After Savage and Sherri began a heated feud with &quot;The American Dream&quot; Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire near the end of 1989, Miss Elizabeth joined forces with Rhodes and Sapphire at WrestleMania VI in April 1990, where the two couples were engaged in the WWF&#x27;s first mixed tag team match. When Sherri attempted to help Savage double-team Rhodes, Miss Elizabeth grabbed Sherri by the hair. While the two women faced off, Sapphire took advantage of the situation, kneeling down behind Sherri just as Miss Elizabeth pushed her. Sherri lost her balance and gave Sapphire enough advantage to pin Sherri for the win. Elizabeth continued to appear on the house show circuit with Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire from May 1990 until August 1990 in mixed tag team matches against Randy Savage and Sherri Martel, with Savage and Sherri adding Brother Love to their corner to counteract Elizabeth. From August 1990, she took a hiatus from appearing at WWF events.

==== Reunion with Randy Savage (1991â1992) ====
Miss Elizabeth did not appear on WWF television until WrestleMania VII in March 1991, where she was in the audience for a retirement match between Savage and the Ultimate Warrior. After Savage lost the match, Sherri began beating and kicking the defeated Savage until Elizabeth entered the ring and defended Savage by grabbing Sherri by the hair and throwing her out of the ring. Savage punctuated the reunion by holding down the ring ropes for Elizabeth after years of her doing it for him.

On June 17, 1991, during the taping of &quot;WWF Superstars of Wrestling&quot; in an in-ring segment with Gene Okerlund announcing, Savage proposed to Miss Elizabeth, which she accepted. The couple then held a heavily promoted on-air wedding billed as &quot;the Match Made in Heaven&quot; in August 1991, at SummerSlam 1991 (in actuality, the couple had married on December 30, 1984). At the wedding reception, Elizabeth opened a gift package containing a live snake, which frightened her; newly turned-heel Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts and the Undertaker crashed the reception and attacked Savage. This started a feud between Roberts and Savage, where Elizabeth quickly figured prominently. The first high-profile Savage-Roberts match was on December 3, 1991, at the Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view event, where, after Savage gained a pinfall victory, Roberts beat down Savage, then forced Elizabeth to beg him to stop the beating. Apparently dissatisfied with her begging, Roberts grabbed her by the hair and slapped her across her face. On the February 8, 1992 &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXX&quot;, Roberts, with a steel chair in tow, was waiting in the backstage area for Elizabeth and Savage to come through the curtain after a match. Roberts was about to strike Elizabeth with the chair, but Undertaker stopped him. This started Undertaker&#x27;s feud with his former ally.

In early 1992, WWF Champion Ric Flair began to brag that he dated Elizabeth before Savage met her. Flair&#x27;s tagline was, &quot;She was mine before she was yours.&quot; He showed photos of himself with Elizabeth in casual situations, which were later printed in an issue of &quot;WWF Magazine&quot;. It was later revealed that the photos were in fact pictures of Savage and Elizabeth, which Flair had doctored. Flair, with Mr. Perfect as his &quot;executive consultant&quot;, said that they were going to show a nude photo of Elizabeth on the screen at WrestleMania VIII, although this did not occur. Nonetheless, Flair&#x27;s claims set up his WrestleMania VIII match with Savage. During the match on April 5, 1992, Elizabeth made her way to ringside, against the wishes of WWF officials. After Savage pinned Flair to win the WWF Championship, an angry Flair cornered Elizabeth and forcibly began to kiss her; Elizabeth slapped Flair away, and Savage began beating Flair until ring officials separated them.

Elizabeth&#x27;s final WWF appearance took place at UK Rampage on April 19, 1992, during an overseas tour of England; in that match, Savage pinned Shawn Michaels after Elizabeth, who had earlier been sent backstage, returned to prevent Sherri&#x27;s interference on Michaels&#x27; behalf. The Savage-Michaels match from England was aired on &quot;WWF Prime Time Wrestling&quot; in June; the publication of the actual Savage-Elizabeth photos in &quot;WWF Magazine&quot; came at about that same time. In August 1992, she and Savage divorced. After the decree was finalized late that summer, Savage issued a statement that was printed in &quot;WWF Magazine&quot; revealing that he and Elizabeth were no longer together and thanking the fans for their support through the years. The publication of Savage&#x27;s statement marked, at the time, a rare acknowledgement of the wrestlers&#x27; private lives for both the WWF and its flagship publication. Savage continued with the WWF for two more years, and except for the statement in &quot;WWF Magazine&quot;, his divorce from Elizabeth was neither referred to nor figured into any of Savage&#x27;s future feuds. Elizabeth retired from wrestling and disappeared from the spotlight for a few years.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1996â2000) ===

==== The Four Horsemen (1996) ====

On January 23, 1996, Miss Elizabeth returned to wrestling as manager for Randy Savage and Hulk Hogan at Clash of the Champions XXXII. Only 3 weeks later, on February 11, 1996, Elizabeth turned on Randy Savage by helping Ric Flair defeat him at SuperBrawl VI and then became Flair&#x27;s co-manager in the Four Horsemen along with Woman.

==== New World Order (1996â1999) ====
In September 1996, Elizabeth joined the New World Order (nWo) alongside Hulk Hogan, but seemed to still care deeply for her ex-husband, and eventually joined his side when he too joined the nWo in February 1997. During much of 1997, Randy Savage and Elizabeth feuded with Diamond Dallas Page and Kimberly Page. In May 1998 at Slamboree, Elizabeth joined nWo Wolfpac. In June 1998, she parted ways with Savage once again by joining nWo Hollywood. Then, she accompanied Eric Bischoff on his way to the ring for the next few months, and derided Savage. Savage coldly reminded her that he &quot;got over her a long time ago&quot; and did not need her.

On the January 4, 1999 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Elizabeth was seen talking to police detectives. According to the storyline, she claimed that Goldberg was stalking her and that he even accosted her by the water cooler. She then filed charges against Goldberg. Goldberg was arrested later that night for aggravated stalking and taken into custody by police. However, later that night, Elizabeth admitted that she was lying. As it turned out, Elizabeth was a pawn for the nWo so that Goldberg would be unable to have his scheduled title match with Kevin Nash later that night. Due to Goldberg&#x27;s apparent absence, the returning Hulk Hogan took Goldberg&#x27;s title shot in the match.

Elizabeth remained part of the New World Order until taking a leave of absence from WCW in April 1999.

==== Managing Lex Luger (1999â2000) ====
In September 1999, Elizabeth returned to WCW television as the manager of Lex Luger. Lex Luger, who was accompanied by Elizabeth at this time to ringside for single matches, was supposed to get ready for the tag team match against Konnan and Rey Mysterio Jr. with Miss Elizabeth&#x27;s hair on the line and Rey Mysterio Jr.&#x27;s mask on the line at SuperBrawl IX with Kevin Nash as his tag team partner. However, on the February 18, 1999 edition of &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;, at the E-Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, a limo pulled up and was driving along with Rey Mysterio Jr. with Lex Luger and Elizabeth inside. As Elizabeth and Lex Luger were getting out of the limo, Rey Mysterio Jr. grabbed the door and slammed it into Lex Luger&#x27;s biceps, injuring him in the process. Lex Luger was immediately replaced by Scott Hall as Kevin Nash&#x27;s tag team partner for the tag team match at Superbrawl IX.

She then took time off from the road to be with Lex Luger during his recovery from a biceps injury.

After Lex Luger recovered from his biceps injury, Elizabeth would make her return to WCW programming on the September 27, 1999 edition of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;. Towards the end of 1999, Elizabeth became much more physically involved in the action than she had ever been. Elizabeth wrestled in her first official match against Meng that ended in a draw. Her new vicious side would be ever so apparent at Starrcade 1999 when she struck Sting with his own baseball bat.

In February 2000, Elizabeth managed the short-lived partnership between Lex Luger and Ric Flair. The three of them were known as Team Package. Shortly thereafter, Team Package went their separate ways as they fought various members of The New Blood.

Elizabeth engaged in short-lived feuds with Vince Russo and Kimberly Page. On May 8, 2000, Elizabeth fought Daffney to a no contest. Elizabeth worked with Kimberly Page for the remainder of May 2000.

Elizabeth&#x27;s final WCW appearance was on the May 29, 2000 edition of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; and Elizabeth quietly left World Championship Wrestling on August 17, 2000, when her contract with WCW expired.

=== Later Career (2002) ===
Elizabeth was advertised to make her first wrestling appearance on television since her departure from WCW in 2000 during the World Wrestling All-Stars tour of Europe in November 2002 and December 2002 alongside Luger. She accompanied Luger on the tour overseas, but did not appear on a single show. Elizabeth never made another wrestling appearance on television after she left WCW. Lex Luger ended up winning and losing the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in matches with Sting during the tour.

== Other media ==
Miss Elizabeth appeared in four WCW video games: &quot;WCW/nWo Revenge&quot;, &quot;WCW Nitro&quot;, &quot;WCW/nWo Thunder&quot; and &quot;WCW Backstage Assault&quot;.

She has also appeared in three WWE video games as an NPC and made a cameo in the 1989 arcade game &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot; as a selectable manager.

==Personal life==
Elizabeth briefly married Cary Lubetsky, a South Florida attorney, on December 6, 1997. The wedding was held at the Cuban Hebrew Temple in Miami Beach. The marriage was short-lived, as the couple soon separated and were officially divorced on April 19, 1999.

Elizabeth and Luger stayed together as a couple after leaving WCW in 2000. After her departure from wrestling, Hulette began working at the front desk at Main Event Fitness in Marietta, Georgia, a gym that Luger had owned for years after he and Steve Borden (Sting) opened it during their wrestling heyday.

On April 19, 2003, Elizabeth was involved in a domestic dispute with Luger, who allegedly struck her in the garage of their townhouse in Marietta, Georgia. Cobb County police found Elizabeth with two bruised eyes, a bump on her head, and a cut lip. Luger was charged with a misdemeanor count of battery and released on $2,500 bond. Two days later on April 21, Luger was arrested for driving under the influence after rear-ending another car while driving his Porsche. According to the report on the arrest, Luger had slurred speech and bloodshot eyes and could not locate his driver&#x27;s license. Luger had a 9mm Luger handgun in the car. Elizabeth was a passenger in the vehicle, and was sent home in a taxicab. Luger was also driving with a suspended license for not appearing in court on March 5, 2003, for a hearing on a previous offense â driving with expired tags and having no proof of vehicle insurance.

=== Death ===

On May 1, 2003, in Marietta, Georgia, Luger called 9-1-1 to report that Hulette was not breathing. She did not respond to mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and paramedics rushed her to the WellStar Kennestone Hospital Emergency Room, where she was pronounced dead at the age of 42. A medical examiner listed the cause of death as &quot;acute toxicity&quot;, brought on by a mix of painkillers and vodka. Her death was ruled an accident. Hulette was buried at Frankfort Cemetery in her hometown of Frankfort, Kentucky.

==History==
Cheektowaga&#x27;s earliest known historic occupants were the Iroquoian-speaking Neutral people. They were pushed out by the more powerful Seneca people, the most western of the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, who were seeking to control the fur trade. They named this site as &quot;Chictawauga&quot;, meaning &quot;land of the crabapples&quot; in the Seneca language.

It was not until well after the American Revolutionary War that European-American settlers began to live here permanently. The Seneca had been forced to cede most of their land to the United States after the war, as they had been British allies. Cheektowaga was formed from the Town of Amherst on March 22, 1839. Upon the formation of West Seneca on October 16, 1851, it was reduced to its present limitsâabout . Throughout the 19th century, it was referred to by its original name, &quot;Chictawauga&quot;.

Originally a rural farming area, the town was extensively developed for suburban housing during the post-World War II subdivision boom of the 1950s. Aided as well by the construction of highways to serve the area, factories such as the Westinghouse Electric Corporation plant on Genesee Street were built here (since demolished). The plant generated employment to the area for many decades. The town maintains a strong blue-collar presence. Cheektowaga has a large Polish-American community, much of which relocated from Buffalo&#x27;s East Side, and about 39.9% of population is of Polish heritage.

The Walden Galleria opened in 1989, becoming the Buffalo Niagara region&#x27;s largest mall.

Cheektowaga is home to St. John Gualbert&#x27;s Parish, which is a small Catholic church housing the Shrine of the Holy Relics of the Saints, believed to be one of the largest collections in the United States.

Garrison Cemetery, Our Lady Help of Christians Chapel, and Villa Maria Motherhouse Complex are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Hamburg ( ) is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 60,085. It is named after the city of Hamburg, Germany. The town is on the western border of the county and is south of Buffalo. Hamburg is one of the Southtowns in Erie County. The villages of Hamburg and Blasdell are in the town. The town of Hamburg was founded in 1812 in Armor.

==History==

Historical evidence shows the area was settled originally by the Erie people. Around 1805 the settlement was known as &quot;Barkerville&quot;, named after Zenas Barker, the postmaster. The earliest settlers were Nathaniel Titus and Dr. Ruth Belden in 1804, and the first landowner in the area was John Cummings, who built the first grist mill in 1806.

The town of Hamburg was formed by government decree on March 20, 1812, from the (now defunct) town of Willink. The first town meeting took place on April 7, 1812, at Jacob Wright&#x27;s tavern at Wright&#x27;s Corners, which was renamed Abbott&#x27;s Corners, and now Armor. One of the early noted activities of the town board that year was to place a $5 bounty on wolf hides, due to the complaints of the local settlers who were being bothered by them.

In 1815, mail routes were established. The earliest settlers in the area were from New England. Germans started arriving in the 1830s and set up many successful farms. On November 29, 1824, a meeting was held in Abbott&#x27;s Corners at the home of early settler Seth Abbott. At a vote of those present, agreement was reached to form a library with the sum of $102.

By 1850, the town was reduced by the formation of the towns of East Hamburgh and West Seneca. Around 1852, the Erie Railroad was built through the area. In 1868 the Erie County Fair came to the town and has been there since that time. In 1875, the weekly publication of the &quot;Erie County Independent&quot; began. This is now known as &quot;The Sun&quot;. Telephone service in the area started in 1886.

The village of Hamburg set itself off from the town in 1874 by incorporating as a village.

Starting in 1890 and to support the growing regional steel industry, Polish and Italians began to arrive in the area.

In 1897, a group of women known as the Nineteenth Century Club started a permanent free public library, known as the Hamburg Free Library. Until 1901 it was in various rented buildings. The Hamburg Free Library was moved into a Carnegie library on Center Street on November 8, 1915, where it remained until 1966 when the current library at 102 Buffalo Street opened.

In 1898, the community of Blasdell set itself apart from the town by incorporating as a village.

A trolley car system was established in the early 1900s.

The Kleis Site, containing the remnants of a 17th-century Iroquoian village and burial ground, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

<text>Holland is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 3,401 at the 2010 census. The name is derived from the Holland Land Company, the original title-holder to most of the land of Western New York.

Holland is one of the &quot;Southtowns&quot; of Erie County, located in the southeast part of the county, and to the southeast of Buffalo.

==History==

The town was first settled along its northern border, then called &quot;Humphrey Valley&quot;, in 1807.

The town of Holland was established in 1818 from part of the (now defunct) town of Willink, which once included all the southern part of Erie County. The name was derived from Willem Willink, one of the original investors of the Holland Land Company, which owned most of the land in western New York and sold it off to cities and townships that exist today. The name &quot;Holland&quot; is one of many surviving remnants of the Dutch investors who once owned this region. As with the town of Willink, the locations named after these investors have been given new names. Many of the original town buildings met their fate due to fire. Today the Holland Historical Society resides in the original fire hall on Main Street.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.10%, is water.

The east town line is the border of the town of Java in Wyoming County.

New York State Route 16 is a major northâsouth highway through the town.

The East Branch of Cazenovia Creek flows northward through Holland.

==Holland Central Schools==
Established in 1933, the school was centralized and a new building was put up on 103 Canada Street. Students left the old school, located today where the town hall resides, after Christmas break of 1932, and moved into the new establishment in January. The Harold O.

<text>Lancaster is a village in Erie County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the village population was 10,352. It is part of the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area.

The village of Lancaster is in the west part of the town of Lancaster and is east of Buffalo.

The Lancaster Opera House is locally famous for its musicals and stage plays. The current mayor is Lynne T. Ruda.

== History ==

The Village of Lancaster was incorporated in 1849 from part of the town of Lancaster. Lancaster is the third oldest incorporated village in Erie County, behind Springville and Gowanda. The village is proud of its historic past and emphasizes preservation of its historic buildings. Lancaster was formerly known as &quot;Cayuga Creek&quot;. Lancaster is one of approximately 30 communities in New York with historic districts.

The oldest house in the village is the CarpenterâDraper House, built in 1831. The Lancaster Presbyterian Church is the second oldest religious structure in Erie County, built in 1832.

Churches in the village include Lancaster Presbyterian Church, St. John&#x27;s Lutheran, Trinity Episcopal, and Faith United Methodist. Catholic churches include St. Mary of the Assumption and Our Lady of Pompeii.

In 1894 the Lancaster Opera House was built. This building is still the main focus of the downtown Lancaster area because of its massive size and its clock tower. Lancaster Town offices are located in the building. This leads people to call the building both the Opera House and Town Hall.

The Central Avenue/Broadway area is the downtown business area in the village. The former West Main Street was at one time another major business street in the downtown area. However, today very few businesses are located on the street due to its demolition in the early 1970s. In the near future, West Main will be re-extended all the way to the intersection of Aurora, North Aurora, and St. Mary&#x27;s streets, as it had before the demolition.

Four railroads (Erie RR, Lehigh Valley RR, Delaware, Lackawanna and Western RR, and New York Central RR) once traversed the village, but only two remain. The fifth railroad in the town of Lancaster, the West Shore RR, did not go through the village, but did have a station in Bowmansville, a hamlet in the northwestern part of the town. Each railroad had a station on Central Ave.

A trolley once went through the village, down Como Park Boulevard from Buffalo, to Lake Avenue, to Church Street, to East Main Street (now Broadway), to Central Avenue, and then finally to Sawyer Avenue. The trolley then continued into the connecting village of Depew, where Sawyer Avenue turned into Main Street.

Several fires have caused damage over the years to the downtown area. The Great Fire of 1894 destroyed much of the west side of Central Avenue and the Grimes-Davis Mansion, which stood at the corner of Broadway and Central Avenue. A gas station now occupies the site.

The village includes part of Como Lake Park, owned and operated by Erie County

Church Street, a street off Broadway, contains many architecturally significant homes.

Lancaster&#x27;s first immigrants were Dutch. Germans came in the mid-1800s, who founded St. Mary of the Assumption Catholic Church. Italian immigrants were the last to populate the village area. They founded Our Lady of Pompeii Catholic Church.

St. John Neumann was a circuit priest in the mid-1800s around the Buffalo area. St. Mary of the Assumption Church (St. Mary&#x27;s on the Hill) was one of his stops. He celebrated mass there once a month. St. John Neumann played a big part in the building of the church and school.

=== Streets in Lancaster ===
Many of the streets in Lancaster are very large and wide, complemented with large, old trees. Broadway has the oldest trees, while Burwell and Sawyer avenues are the widest residential streets.

Most of Central Avenue north of Sawyer Avenue and south of Hinchey Avenue is below grade level. The reason for this is that three of the four bridges that carry railroads are very close together. All of the streets coming into Central Avenue must slant downwards toward it. The houses on Central Avenue are above street level. Central Avenue is also very wide.

Many of Lancaster&#x27;s streets still contain original brick underneath the pavement.

<text>Lancaster is a town in Erie County, New York, United States, centered 14 miles east of downtown Buffalo. Lancaster is an outer ring suburb of Buffalo. As of the 2020 Census, the town population was 45,106.

Located within the town is the village of Lancaster and the eastern half of the village of Depew. Depew&#x27;s western half lies within the town of Cheektowaga.

==History==
In 1803, the Holland Land Company sold its first plot of land in the future town. The town of Lancaster was formed from the town of Clarence in 1833. The town was named after Lancaster, Massachusetts, but the reason for applying this name is not known. Originally called &quot;Cayuga Creek&quot;, the town later incorporated and obtained the current name.

Lancaster has the oldest stone structure in Erie County, the Warren Hull House. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Also within the town is the Gipple Cabin, the oldest wooden structure in Erie County. The cabin is on private land just south of the northern town line. The cabin was dismantled in the fall of 2013 and relocated to the Hull House property for preservation. The &quot;Lancaster Bee News&quot; stated it was stored in a barn on the original property and not taken for restoration. The Lancaster District School No. 6 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

In 1857, the town&#x27;s southern half was taken to form the town of Elma.

In the late 1960s, Buffalo developer Edward H. Cottrell proposed what would have been the world&#x27;s second domed stadium in Lancaster. The Dome Stadium Incorporated was formed but the County refused to participate and resulted in a 20-year breach of contract litigation and eventually lead a dismissal in 1986.

Once known as a small town with a small town atmosphere, Lancaster has, in recent years, evolved into a suburban community, due to the white flight from Buffalo. In the early 1990s, the town entered a period of rapid growth, with much development in the southern and eastern parts of the town. The William Street Intermediate School opened in the southern part of town in the mid-1990s, and in 2003, the town and village police departments merged. Additions to the middle school and the William Street School to accommodate rising enrollment were finished in 2005.

Lancaster High School is Erie County&#x27;s largest school in both student population and square footage. With over 2,000 students, the building was expanded twice. First in 1970 and in 2000, a field house was added. In 2003, the high school opened up a new wing to house natural sciences classrooms.

Some of the town&#x27;s biggest events are held in the village of Lancaster. They are the Fourth of July Parade and the Taste of Lancaster, a restaurant festival and charity fundraiser. The Lancaster/Depew high school football game is held in October. The game dates back to 1919.

Lancaster once had its own professional football team in the 1910s. The Lancaster Malleables played in the New York Pro Football League and won the league championship in 1913 and 1914.

==Historic buildings==
The town of Lancaster contains several historic buildings, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The buildings include the Warren Hull House, the Lancaster District School No. 6, and many of the Village of Lancaster&#x27;s Multiple Property Submission properties, including the Bruce-Briggs Brick Block, Clark-Lester House, DePew Lodge No. 823, Free and Accepted Masons, US Post Office-Lancaster, Lancaster Municipal Building, Liebler-Rohl Gasoline Station, Miller-Mackey House, Dr. John J. Nowak House, Herman B. VanPeyma House, John Richardson House, Zuidema-Idsardi House and the John P. Sommers House. The twelve latter properties are located within the Village of Lancaster.

The US Post Office-Depew, which is located on the town of Lancaster&#x27;s side of the village of Depew, is technically in the town of Lancaster, so it is included on the list of historic sites.

A domed football stadium was planned to be built in Lancaster. A plan from January 30, 1970, called for the domed stadium on Pleasant View Drive that would allow for football and baseball games. It would have been modeled after the Houston Astrodome. The Erie County Legislature scrapped the plan a week after Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson, Jr. demanded a definitive stadium plan within 60 days. After scrapping the plan, legislators passed a resolution to seek an alternative project immediately. The domed stadium was first proposed in 1967 but its implementation was blocked over disputes about the location.

In 2001, VFW Post 7275 was named in honor of Medal of Honor recipient Lt. Col. Matt Urban.

==Education==
The Lancaster Central School District includes the majority of the town. Other parts of the town are in Alden Central School District, Clarence Central School District, Depew Union Free School District, and Iroquois Central School District

The town is home to Lancaster High School and five operating elementary schools; Como Park, Court Street, Hillview, John A. Sciole (which is actually located on the Cheektowaga side of the village of Depew), and the former Central Avenue Elementary School. It also includes the William Street Intermediate School (4th, 5th and 6th grades), and the historic Lancaster Middle School (formerly named Aurora Middle School), which was the town&#x27;s high school prior to the construction of the current one in 1953. They are all part of the Lancaster Central School District.

There are also a number of private schools (with the Catholic schools being affiliated with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo), including St. Mary&#x27;s High School, Chesterton Academy of Buffalo, St. Mary&#x27;s on the Hill Elementary, and the now closed Our Lady of Pompeii Elementary. Our Lady of Pompeii closed in 2014. In January 2014 it had 14 employees and 70 students.

The Lancaster District is the largest school district in population in Erie County with one high school. The district serves most of the town and village, including a large majority of the northern part of the village of Depew, on both the Lancaster and Cheektowaga sides. The Depew Union Free School District serves most of the southern part of the village of Depew and almost none of the town or village of Lancaster.

==Fire, police and emergency medical services==
The town of Lancaster is served by four volunteer fire companies. The fire companies are the Bowmansville Volunteer Fire Association, Town Line Fire Department, Twin District Fire Company, and Millgrove Volunteer Fire Department. Bowmansville and Town Line each have two fire stations, while Twin District and Millgrove each operate out of one. Two of the fire companies are located within their respective hamlets, Bowmansville and Town Line. All four town companies respond to all alarms of fire along with requests for EMS.

The Millgrove Fire Company is actually not located in the town of Lancaster. Millgrove is a hamlet in the town of Alden, but because the small hamlet of Millgrove is so close to the northeastern portion of Lancaster, the fire company serves a very small portion of the town.

The Lancaster Village Fire Department serves the village of Lancaster with two stations. The main station is located in the Lancaster Municipal Building, and the Northside Station Two is on West Drullard Avenue. The LFD does not respond to EMS calls, except when requested for calls such as MVAs or lift assists.

The Lancaster Police Department serves the town and village of Lancaster. Prior to the 21st century, the town and village had separate police departments. It was the first major consolidation of law enforcement in Western New York. The LPD operates with roughly 51 officers, which includes road patrol, bike team, 3 school resource officers, detective bureau, and the police tactical team, the ERT (Emergency Response Team). The Lancaster Police Department operates out of the Lancaster Town Center, located at 525 Pavement Road. It was the site of a former United States Army Nike base, where the police still operate out of the former administration building. A new police and courts center was built on the Pavement Road site and officially opened February 5, 2014. The current Chief of Police is William J. Karn, Jr.

The Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps responds to all requests for EMS in Lancaster village and town, along with the village of Depew. It is located at 40 Embry Place within the village limits. Lancaster Ambulance operates with a fleet of seven ambulances and one fly car. It is a combination staffed EMS agency, which has career EMTs, AEMTs, and paramedics on duty 24/7/365. The average yearly call volume is over 4,000 calls and increasing.

Orchard Park was founded by Quaker settlers in 1803. The village, formerly called &quot;Potters Corners&quot;, was incorporated in 1921. The name change to &quot;Orchard Park&quot; was suggested by a local schoolteacher. Several years later, the town also changed its name from &quot;East Hamburg&quot; to &quot;Orchard Park&quot;, after the village.

Orchard Park was a stop on the Underground Railroad, as fugitive slaves stopped over at Quaker-run homes on their way north to Black Rock in Buffalo from Collins.

==Geography==

Green Lake is a small artificial lake within the village.

U.S. Route 20A (Quaker Street) passes through the village, intersecting with New York State Route 240/New York State Route 277. At this intersection the street name of Route 277 changes from Orchard Park Road (which leads toward the city) to N/S Buffalo Street (which leads into the village). This causes people in the village to refer to Route 277 as Buffalo Street and people that aren&#x27;t from the village to call it Orchard Park Road. This intersection is known locally as the &quot;Four Corners&quot; and is the center of the village.

==Landmarks==
*The Quaker Meeting House is located in the Village of Orchard Park. It was built by Quakers in 1820 and is the oldest house of worship in Erie County and is the home of the county&#x27;s oldest congregation. The cemetery surrounding it is maintained by the East Hamburg Friends Cemetery Association and contains the graves of many of Orchard Park&#x27;s first settlers.
*The Orchard Park station is a historic railway station built by the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway company in 1911. It is located at 2 Highland Avenue and is owned and maintained by the Western New York Railway Historical Society, Inc.
*Located at 4287 South Buffalo Street is the former residence of Dr. Willard B. Jolls who practiced medicine there from 1902 to 1963. The house was built in 1869 by merchant Ambrose Johnson. It is owned by the Town of Orchard Park and is the location of Orchard Park Historical Society Museum.

==Government==
As of April 2015, the mayor of the village of Orchard Park is Jo Ann Litwin Clinton. The village presently holds a single government function: the Department of Public Works, which maintains the streets, sidewalks, domestic water system and sewer system. This is much reduced from the village&#x27;s original organization, under which it managed the Orchard Park Police department and the fire department, and operated a sewage treatment plant on Duerr Road and a water treatment reservoir and treatment plant in West Falls. As the influence of the Town of Orchard Park increased, the municipal functions moved to the town. In the 1980s the sewer treatment functions were turned over to Erie County, and the plant closed. In the early 1990s the water treatment plant and reservoir were abandoned, with water supply being managed by the Erie County Water Authority. The main reason for this change were Clean Water Act requirements which the old &quot;Water Plant&quot; could not maintain having been constructed during the Great Depression in the 1930s.

The village DPW continues to maintain the road, water lines, sewer lines and sidewalks year-round with a seven- to eight-man crew. This is reduced from the days when the DPW crew grew in the summer to eleven to twelve men and crews would completely engineer and rebuild entire village streets.

<doc id="259780" wikidata="Q1380722" url="?curid=259780" title="Tonawanda, New York">
<text>Tonawanda is a city in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 15,129 at the 2020 census. It is at the northern edge of Erie County, south across the Erie Canal (Tonawanda Creek) from North Tonawanda, east of Grand Island, and north of Buffalo. It is part of the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area.

==History==
The city&#x27;s name is from the word &quot;TahnawÃ¡â¢teh&quot; in Tuscarora meaning &quot;confluent stream&quot;.

Post-Revolutionary War white settlement at Tonawanda began with Henry Anguish, who built a log home in 1808. He added to the hamlet in 1811 with a tavern, both on the south side of Tonawanda Creek where it empties into the Niagara River. The hamlet grew slowly until the opening of the Erie Canal, completed in the course of the creek in 1825. The Town of Tonawanda was incorporated in 1836. The Erie Canal and the railroads that soon followed it provided economic opportunity. By the end of the 19th century, both sides of the canal were devoted to businesses as part of a leading lumber processing center. In the mid-19th century, the business center of Tonawanda was incorporated as a village within the town. The village united in a corporation with North Tonawanda across the canal. This corporation fell apart, and in 1904 the village was incorporated as the City of Tonawanda.

On September 26, 1898, a tornado struck the City of Tonawanda. After crossing over the river from Grand Island, the tornado damaged the old Murray School as well as several homes along Franklin and Kohler streets. Its worst havoc was wreaked along Fuller Avenue, where a dozen homes were severely damaged, several being leveled to the ground. No one was killed by the fierce storm, but there were numerous injuries.

===Goose Island===
From the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, a section of Tonawanda was known as Goose Island. Goose Island was a man-made island in the Niagara River formed by the Erie Canal. Goose Island was a triangular piece of land bordered on one side by the Niagara River, on the second side by the Tonawanda Creek, and on the third by the Erie Canal. It was then famous with seamen the world over as the terminus of the Erie Canal and for the Goose Island girls. The Goose Island Section of Tonawanda had many cheap boarding houses, cheap hotels, bars, and brothels. Canalers often wintered over on Goose Island. Goose Island was known as a bad section of Tonawanda, with drunkenness, brawling, and bawdy displays being commonplace. The gentrification of Goose Island began with the decline of the lumbering port business in Tonawanda and the building of a boxboard mill there on the island. Then the canal was motorized, eliminating the need for mules and for many canal men. Next the section of the canal from Tonawanda to Buffalo was abandoned in 1918. That section of the canal was filled in and Goose Island was no longer an island. The establishments in the Goose Island section of Tonawanda came under community pressure in the 1920s and 1930s and were closed, with more of the land there being given over to the boxboard mill. In the 1970s the boxboard mill closed and was razed along with many remaining Goose Island structures. Goose Island street names Tonawanda, First, Clay and Chestnut disappeared. At the turn of the millennium waterfront dwellings were built along the Niagara River, completing the gentrification of this area.

===Spaulding Fibre===
Spaulding Fibre became a manufacturer of leatherboard (made from leather scraps and wood pulp), transformer board, vulcanized fibre, bakelite (under the trade name Spauldite) and Filawound (fiberglass) tube. Operating in Tonawanda from 1911 to 1992, it became the major employer in the city. The company was founded in 1873 with a leatherboard mill by Jonas Spaulding and his brother Waldo in Townsend Harbor, Massachusetts. They did business as The Spaulding Brothers Company. Jonas Spaulding had three sons: Leon C., Huntley N. and Rolland H.

With industry expanding, Jonas established leatherboard mills at Milton and North Rochester, New Hampshire, in part to allow his sons to join him in the business. The New Hampshire mills operated under the name J. Spaulding and Sons. After Jonas Spaulding&#x27;s death in 1900, his sons (by then living in New Hampshire, where they had corporate headquarters at Rochester) continued to operate these mills successfully. They brought the Townsend Harbor mill under the J. Spaulding and Sons banner in 1902.

With continued success, the three Spaulding brothers added a vulcanized fibre operation in Tonawanda, New York in 1911. They added a fourth leatherboard mill in Milton (second in this community) in 1913. The mayor of Tonawanda, Charles Zuckmaier, had solicited the Spaulding brothersâ business in Tonawanda. A ground-breaking ceremony was held on July 17, 1911, for the new plant, a $600,000 investment by J. Spaulding and Sons. Operations began on April 1, 1912, with 40 employees. The daily capacity of the plant at the time was five tons of fibre sheeting and one ton of fibre tubing.
Around 1924, the sons changed the name of the company to the Spaulding Fibre Company. In the 1930s, they added a second product at the Tonawanda plant: Spauldite, a &quot;me too&quot; phenol formaldehyde resin material made to compete with Bakelite. The trademark now owned by Spaulding Composites can be applied to laminates made with other natural or synthetic resins as well.

After Huntley Spaulding, the last of the three brothers, died in November 1955, the Spaulding Fibre Company became part of a charitable trust previously set up by Huntley and his only sister, Marion S. Potter. The trust was created to disburse their remaining wealth within 15 years of the death of the last sibling. Marion S. Potter died on September 27, 1957.

The company in Tonawanda flourished under foremen, superintendents and workers from the local blue collar workforce. It also attracted new residents who came for the jobs. One was Richard Spencer, who left the oil fields of Bradford, Pennsylvania, to be a superintendent for two decades. He managed through several labor strikes and periods of economic unrest for the company.

In 1956, the Tonawanda plant completed an expansion that doubled the paper mill and the vulcanized fibre-making capacity of the plant. In addition, after the death of Huntley Spaulding, corporate offices relocated to Wheeler Street from Rochester, New Hampshire. In the 1960s, the Tonawanda plant added a third product line, Filawound (fiberglass) tubing.

The 50th anniversary of the Wheeler Street Plant in 1961 was marked by a special 22-page section in the &quot;Tonawanda News&quot;. The Wheeler Street Plant reportedly covered , employed 1,500 workers, and had an annual payroll of $9,000,000. The company paid $153,818 in city taxes that year and was Tonawanda&#x27;s largest taxpayer. The plant was nearing its peak, but there was more expansion to come.

In 1966, the charitable trust sold the Spaulding Fibre Company to Monogram Industries. The Tonawanda plant began a slow decline during a period of industrial restructuring and product and manufacturing changes. In 1984, Monogram Industries sold the Spaulding Fibre Company to Nortek. In 1988, Nortek changed the company name to Spaulding Composites. Spaulding Composites closed the Tonawanda plant on August 24, 1992.

By the time the plant closed, employment had declined to 300. Since the closure of the Tonawanda plant, Spaulding Composites twice filed for bankruptcy. The plant site had a footprint of . It fell into disrepair and, because of the wastes of the industrial processes, was classified as a brown field site under environmental regulations.

In 2006, the Erie County Development Agency contracted for demolition of the derelict facilities. It was punctuated by the felling of the -tall smoke stack that dominated the site. (This event is documented with a handful of videos on YouTube.) Cleanup of the site was declared complete in August 2010.

===Neighborhoods and locations===
* Gastown â A neighborhood in the northeast corner of Tonawanda, bordering the Erie Canal. Its name comes from the Gas Light Co., which was built on Long&#x27;s Point, home of the historical Long&#x27;s Homestead.
* &quot;The Hill&quot; (aka &quot;Riverview&quot;) â A region centered around Tonawanda High School, so named because of its slightly elevated topography when compared with the rest of the relatively flat city. It is also known as Clay Hill as it was formed by a terminal glacial moraine that deposited the clay that forms the hill. The area near the high school was the site of popular clay tennis courts.
* Millstream â A neighborhood on the city&#x27;s eastern side. It is named for a stream that flowed through the area, but has since been mostly channelled underground.

==Culture==

===Canal Fest===
In conjunction with the City of North Tonawanda, the City of Tonawanda celebrates an annual Canal Fest of the Tonawandas. For one week, members of both communities celebrate Tonawanda&#x27;s historic location on the western end of the Erie Canal in the largest festival of its kind. The Festival began in 1983 when Freemasons in the area, in conjunction with several state and regional leaders, set out to promote the businesses of the Tonawandas, provide fund raising opportunities for local non-profit organizations, and provide recreational activities for the citizens of both Tonawanda and North Tonawanda.

The first Canal Fest was held on both sides of the canal in 1983. Today, the Canal fest is organized by the Canal Fest of the Tonawandas Inc., a non-profit organization. It is estimated over 150,000 people attend the Canal Fest each year, though an accurate number is impossible to obtain since attending the event is free of charge and there are no turnstiles to measure crowds. The Canal Fest is the largest event held along the Erie Canal today and is in the top percentile of New York State events. In 2020, Canal Fest was cancelled for the first time due to the 2019-2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.

===Gateway Harbor===

Also in conjunction with the city of North Tonawanda, Tonawanda is home to Gateway Harbor, a public park that runs along the Erie Canal just before it joins the Niagara River. During the summer, local boaters are free to dock at the park, and the area becomes popular during the free concerts set up by the local chamber of commerce. Various local businesses sponsor a series of concerts on both the Tonawanda and North Tonawanda sides of the park.

===Landmarks===
The Historical Society of the Tonawandas operates a museum in the former New York Central &amp; Hudson Valley Railroad station, which has exhibits depicting the area&#x27;s lumber industry and Erie Canal history. The Long Homestead is a restored Pennsylvania German-style house built in 1829 and containing period furniture from the early 19th century (the Historical Society of the Tonawandas provides guided tours). Isle View Park, on the Niagara River overlooking Grand Island, is available for biking, hiking, rollerblading, fishing and launching boats. The Riverwalk trail passes through the park, and a pedestrian foot bridge connects the park to Niawanda Park.

===NFL team===
Tonawanda was home of the Tonawanda Kardex Lumbermen, a professional football team active between 1916 and 1921, best known for its brief one-game stint in the National Football League.

==In popular culture==
Tonawanda is the home of inventor Phillip Louis (Phil) Perew, who is fictionalized in the alternate history world created by artist and author couple Paul Guinan and Anina Bennett. In this history, created for the graphic novels &quot;Boilerplate&quot; and &quot;Femopolis&quot;, Perew creates an electromechanical man, called the &#x27;Automatic Man&#x27;, in the late 19th century. (At the time of writing, in February 2007, &quot;Femopolis&quot; has not been published.)

In the HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, Easy Company soldier Warren &quot;Skip&quot; Muck states he is from Tonawanda and he swam across the Niagara River. Muck died in the Battle of Bastogne and is on the City of Tonawanda memorial to soldiers killed in World War II.

In the 1998 film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, Private James Ryan is rescued by Tom Hanks&#x27; character. The Ryan character was based upon Sgt. Fritz (Frederick) Niland. Niland lost two brothers, Robert and Preston in the Normandy Landings. Edward Niland (a third brother) was listed as killed in action in the Pacific, but was found in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp at the end of the war. Fritz and Skip Muck were best friends and enlisted in the 101st Airborne together in 1942.

In Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Diaries of Adam and Eve&quot;, first published in 1906, and popularized by the musical &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;, Tonawanda is identified as the site Adam and Eve move to after they are removed from the Garden of Eden (which is identified as &quot;Niagara Falls Park&quot;).

<text>Tonawanda (formally the Town of Tonawanda; ) is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 72,636. The town is at the north border of the county and is the northern inner ring suburb of Buffalo. It is sometimes referred to, along with its constituent village of Kenmore, as &quot;Ken-Ton&quot;. The town was established in 1836, and up to 1903 it included what is now the city of Tonawanda.

== History ==
The Town of Tonawanda is located at the former west-southwest shore of glacial Lake Tonawanda. The lake followed the southern side of the Niagara Escarpment and drained when Lake Erie&#x27;s hydrological path started to go over Niagara Falls.

This area was under French control from the 17th century until it was ceded to the British after the French and Indian War.

The first European settlers arrived around 1805. Rapid growth began after the construction of the Erie Canal, completed in 1825. Tonawanda occupies the northwest corner of Erie County and is bounded on the north by the Erie Canal, which here follows Tonawanda Creek.

The town of Tonawanda was established in 1836, by separation from the town of Buffalo (now part of the city of Buffalo). At that time it included land that later became part of the town of Grand Island (established 1852) and the entire city of Tonawanda (established 1904).

In 1899, Kenmore incorporated as a village of the town, and remained the town&#x27;s primary residential and commercial district until the rest of the town was heavily developed into suburban housing in the 1940s and 1950s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 7.61%, is water.

The northern border of the town is the city of Tonawanda and Tonawanda Creek, which is part of the Erie Canal, and the western border is the Niagara River. Ellicott Creek flows parallel to Tonawanda Creek in the northern part of the town, with a confluence just east of the Niagara River. The eastern border, marked by U.S. Route 62 (Niagara Falls Boulevard), is the town of Amherst. Forming the southern border is the village of Kenmore and the city of Buffalo.

In 1998 TCC had been cited by the EPA for violations of oil spill prevention sections of the federal Clean Water Act following contamination of the nearby Niagara River. The investigations into air quality revealed TCC was using an unreported pressure-relief system to vent coke oven gases containing benzene direct to the atmosphere, operating a coke-quenching tower without pollution-control baffles, and dumping hazardous waste in the form of coal tar sludge.

In March 2013 TCC was convicted by a federal jury on 11 counts of violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) and three counts of violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In March 2014 TCC was sentenced in federal court to pay a $12.5 million penalty and $12.2 million in community service payments for the violations. TCC&#x27;s Environmental Control Manager, Mark L. Kamholz, was convicted of 11 counts of violating the CAA, one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of violating the RCRA, and was sentenced to one year in prison, 100 hours of community service, and a $20,000 fine.

In July 2014 DuPont was fined $440,000 for violations of the CAA at its plant at Sheridan Drive and River Road. The EPA found that the plant had inadequate pollution-control equipment, failed to maintain a monitoring system for the equipment, violated several reporting requirements and underreported air pollution on its annual statements. Emissions from the plant included methyl methacrylate and vinyl fluoride.

===Landmarks===
One of the Town of Tonawanda&#x27;s best known landmarks is the blue Korean War-era Grumman F9F-6P Cougar Naval airframe displayed in Walter M. Kenney Field at the northwest corner of Brighton Road and Colvin Boulevard. The &quot;blue jet&quot;, as it is often called, has been on loan to the town from the U.S. government since May 1959. Immediately behind the F9F-6P airframe is the Town of Tonawanda Veterans Memorial, dedicated on August 18, 2009. Retired U.S. Army General and former U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell delivered the keynote address during the memorial&#x27;s dedication ceremony before a crowd of more than 1,500.

The Town of Tonawanda Historical Society operates a museum out of a former German Evangelical Church constructed in 1849. This facility, located at 100 Knoche Road, is the oldest public building in the town.

<text>West Seneca is a town in Erie County, New York, United States. The population was 45,500 at the 2020 census. West Seneca is a centrally located interior town of the county, and a suburb of Buffalo. West Seneca, Orchard Park and Hamburg form the inner &quot;Southtowns&quot;, a cluster of middle-class suburban towns.

==History==
Because the town is on land of the former Buffalo Creek Reservation, it was not open to white settlement until the mid-19th century.

In 1851, the town of Seneca was formed from parts of the towns of Cheektowaga and Hamburg. The town changed the name to &quot;West Seneca&quot; in 1852 to avoid confusion with the town of Seneca in Ontario County, New York. In 1909 the area immediately south of Buffalo split from West Seneca, becoming the city of Lackawanna.

Following election day in 2019, the town elected a Republican Town Supervisor for the first time in 50 years and first town board member in 13 years, despite having a two to one Democrat to Republican ratio among registered voters (a Democrat running as an Independent also ran in the Supervisorial race).

The Eaton Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Community of True Inspiration Residence was listed in 2013.

==Geography==

<doc id="259790" wikidata="Q510021" url="?curid=259790" title="Malone (village), New York">
<text>Malone is a village in, and the county seat of, Franklin County, New York, United States. Its population was 5,911 at the 2010 census. The village is in the town of Malone. It is home to a campus of North Country Community College.

== History ==
The community was first settled around 1802. During the War of 1812, the village was sacked by British troops making incursions from what would become Canada.
Malone was incorporated as a village in 1853. It served as a staging point for one arm of the 1866 and 1870 Fenian raids of Canada, which took place at many points along the CanadaâUnited States border. The Fenian Brotherhood (Fenians) attempted to capture Canada to end British rule of Ireland.

Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote the book &quot;Farmer Boy&quot; about Almanzo Wilder, who attended Franklin Academy here. The school is now the site of the Malone Middle School, and the Wilder Homestead is a historical site that lies about east of the village of Malone in the town of Burke. The First Congregational Church, likely the one mentioned in &quot;Farmer Boy&quot;, was the first Christian congregation founded and the first church building built in Franklin County. There is anecdotal evidence that the second church building (1852â1883) was one of the final stops in the Underground Railroad. A tunnel for the persons seeking freedom can still be found in the church&#x27;s basement.

In 1935, Dutch Schultz had his tax evasion trial moved from Manhattan to Malone. After a media-saturated trial before a Malone-area jury, he was acquitted. In 1998, the village suffered a natural disaster as part of the North American Ice Storm of 1998. On November 6, 2012, a proposal to dissolve the village into the surrounding town of Malone was defeated by a 2-to-1 margin, with village residents voting 1,117â562 to keep the village intact.

In addition to the First Congregational Church and Wilder Homestead, the Horton Gristmill, Anselm Lincoln House, Malone Armory, Malone Freight Depot, Paddock Building, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Economy==
Primarily a farming community, Malone is surrounded by dairy farms and potato producers, and was previously known for growing hops.

The New York Central and Rutland Railroads once had major switching and maintenance yards here.

Products manufactured in Malone included Sno-Pruf waterproofer for boots, woolen winter wear produced by Ballard Mill, and Sioux-Mocs slippers. Malone became known as the snowmobile capital of the United States when a local farm equipment dealer agreed to become the exclusive distributor for Bombardier Recreational Products east of the Mississippi.

A number of prisons have been built in the vicinity, becoming major employers. 

The latest economic controversy to impact the community is the advent of significant wind farms in the region. Several decades ago, local farmers staged protests against the eminent domain-backed incursion of 765Â MW transmission lines that crossed their pastures to bring Saint Lawrence Seaway power through Northern New York to downstate urban users. 

Tourism is a major economic contributor, with Titus Mountain south of the village drawing skiers, and the 36-hole Robert Trent Jones-designed Malone Golf Club drawing golfers from Montreal, Quebec.

<text>Johnstown is a town located in Fulton County, New York, United States. As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 7,098. The name of the town is from landowner William Johnson. The town of Johnstown is located on the southern border of the county. It borders on three sides the city of Johnstown and the city of Gloversville.

== History ==
Johnstown was founded by William Johnson, a British military officer and colonial government official, in a region once known as &quot;Kingsborough&quot;. Johnson named the settlement after his son, John Johnson, and by 1762 constructed a baronial hall.

In 1781, during the American Revolution, colonial forces, consisting of militia and Oneida allies, were victorious over a mixed force of Loyalists and Native allies. All of the holdings of the Johnson family were forfeited due to the family&#x27;s allegiance to Britain.

The town of Johnstown was formed in 1793 from the town of Caughnawaga and served as the seat of sprawling Montgomery County, which encompassed a major portion of upstate New York. The town was divided afterwards to form new towns in the county: Mohawk (1837 and now in Montgomery County), Bleecker (1831), and Caroga (1842). In 1772, Johnson constructed a courthouse and jail, partly at his own expense, leading to further development.

The core of the town was incorporated as a village in 1808. Later, in 1895, the village was chartered as the city of Johnstown.

The town was early involved in the tanning of leather and manufacture of leather goods, primarily gloves.

<text>Johnstown is a city in and the county seat of Fulton County in the U.S. state of New York. The city was named after its colonial founder, Sir William Johnson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Britain in the Province of New York and a major general during the Seven Years&#x27; War in North America. It is located approximately northwest of Albany, about one-third of the way between Albany and the Finger Lakes region to the west, in the Mohawk Valley region, within the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains.

The city of Johnstown is mostly surrounded by the town of Johnstown, of which it was once a part when it was a village. Adjacent to Johnstown is the City of Gloversville. The two cities are together known as the &quot;Glove Cities&quot; due to their history of manufacturing gloves and other leather apparel. Gloversville and Johnstown constituted the center of the American glove industry for 90 years until competition from other countries drove most manufacturers out of business.

As of the 2010 Census, the city had population of 8,743.

== History ==
=== Early colonial history ===
The Irishman William Johnson came to the Province of New York from Ireland in 1738. Johnson was a trader who learned Indigenous languages and culture and formed close relationships with many Native American leaders, especially those of the Mohawk and other members of the Iroquois Confederacy. Johnson made use of his alliances and influence with the Iroquois on behal of the British during the French and Indian War, in which he was a major general. He helped Great Britain defeat France and take over control of certain territories in North America.

As a reward for his services, Johnson received large tracts of land in what are now Hamilton and Fulton counties in New York. Johnson established Johnstown and became one of New York&#x27;s most prosperous and influential citizens. 

Johnson was the largest landowner in the Mohawk Valley, with an estate of more than before his death. Having begun as an Indian trader, Johnson expanded his business interests to include a sawmill and lumber business and a flour mill that served the area. Johnson, the largest enslaver in the county and perhaps in the state of New York, enslaved some 60 Africans to labor for these businesses. He also recruited many Scottish Highlander and Irish tenant farmers to work his lands. Observing Johnson&#x27;s successful business endeavors, the local Native American inhabitants dubbed him &quot;Warragghivage&quot;, or &quot;he who does much business.&quot;

Johnson founded the village of Johnstown â originally &quot;John&#x27;s Town&quot; â in 1762, naming it after his son John Johnson. Johnson built a school, which was free but not mandatory, to educate both Mohawk and white children. He was also instrumental in the organization of St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. Johnson, who had been living in what is now known as Old Fort Johnson, also built a large manor house and estate for himself in 1763, Johnson Hall, where he lived until his death. Johnson Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. New York State operates it as a historic site.

As the area owned and settled by Johnson grew, he convinced the governor, William Tryon, to establish a new county in upstate New York west of Albany County. This new county was named Tryon, after the governor, and Johnstown became the county seat. The county courthouse, built by William Johnson in Johnstown in 1772, partly at his own expense, still stands today, as the oldest operating courthouse in New York. Sir William Johnson died in 1774 before the American colonies declared their independence from Britain.

=== Revolutionary War and aftermath ===
After the onset of the American Revolutionary War, many British Loyalists, including Johnson&#x27;s son John and his family, fled Johnstown and the surrounding area for Canada. The state confiscated all of the Johnson property in 1779 because of the family&#x27;s Loyalist sentiments and support for the British cause. Johnson Hall suffered vandalism at the hands of Continental soldiers quartered there. The house and estate were subsequently sold to Silas Talbot, a naval officer and hero of the American Revolution.

Although most of the fighting during the Revolution occurred elsewhere, Johnstown did see some fighting late in the war. With area residents not knowing of Cornwallis&#x27; defeat and surrender at the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia, about 1,400 soldiers fought at the Battle of Johnstown, one of the last battles of the Revolution, on October 25, 1781. The Continental forces, led by Col. Marinus Willett of Fort Johnstown, ultimately put the British to flight after they had burned large tracts of land in the Mohawk Valley.

After the war, Johnstown became part of Montgomery County when Tryon County was renamed to honor the Continental General Richard Montgomery, who died at the Battle of Quebec.

===19th century to the present===
In 1803, the community of Johnstown was incorporated as a village. In 1838, Johnstown&#x27;s county affiliation changed yet again when what by then remained of Montgomery County was divided into two separate counties: Montgomery and Fulton. While the village of Fonda became the new county seat of Montgomery County, Johnstown became the county seat of Fulton County. The village of Johnstown became a city in 1895, becoming separate from the surrounding town.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who became a prominent activist for women&#x27;s rights, was born in Johnstown in 1815 and was educated at the Johnstown Academy.

In 1889, Johnstown suffered a devastating flood. The Cayadutta Creek rampaged, Schreiber&#x27;s Skin Mill was swept away, as was the State Street bridge, and over twenty people were drowned or missing when the flood carried away the Perry Street bridge.

In 1906, the state of New York bought Johnson Hall from its private owners in order to renovate and preserve it.

====Industrialization====
With plentiful forests of hemlock trees and the wood bark they produced, Johnstown became a center for tanning of leather during the late 19th century. By the early 20th century, Johnstown, along with neighboring Gloversville, became known as the glove-making capital of the world, nicknamed the &quot;Glove Cities&quot;. Many related businesses once existed to support the glove and leather industries around Johnstown. Box manufacturers, thread dealers, sewing machine repairers, chemical companies, and many others made a living helping to supply and service the industry.

One of the other early industries established in Johnstown was the Knox gelatine plant. It was built in 1890 by Charles B. Knox, a prominent Johnstown resident, who developed the granulated, unflavored gelatin still used in food preparation today. When Knox died in 1908, his wife Rose Knox managed the business. She became one of the earliest successful American businesswomen. The Knox family and its philanthropic foundation were generous to the city, giving it the block of land known as Knox Field, where playgrounds, athletic fields, and bridle paths are located. The city named Knox Junior High School for the family. The Knox Gelatin plant, once a major employer in Johnstown, closed in 1975 following the sale of the company to the Lipton Tea Company.

==Geography==
Johnstown is located along the southern edge of Fulton County, in the picturesque Mohawk Valley of upstate New York. It is slightly north of the route developed for the Erie Canal through what is now Montgomery County. Although not a hilltown, Johnstown is close to the Adirondack Mountains that stretch across the northern portion of Fulton County. It is near the southern border of the Adirondack Park.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.17%, is water. The city is bordered to the north, east, and west by the town of Johnstown, to the northeast by the city of Gloversville, and to the south by the town of Mohawk in Montgomery County.

Cayadutta Creek, which runs through the city, provided water power needed to generate the electricity required by the various industries that grew up in Johnstown. The creek flows south to join the Mohawk River at Fonda.

East-west highways, New York State Route 29 and New York State Route 67, intersect in the city and also cross the north-south highway New York State Route 30A. NY 29 leads east to Saratoga Springs and northwest to Rockwood. NY 67 leads southeast to Amsterdam and west to St. Johnsville. NY 30A leads northeast to Gloversville and to Mayfield, as well as south to Fonda and to the New York Thruway.

==Notable people==

===Silas Talbot===
Silas Talbot moved with his family to Johnstown, where he purchased Sir William Johnson&#x27;s estate and manor house. A hero of the American Revolution, he later served as a member of the New York Assembly (1792â1793) and as a congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives (1793â1794) from that district.

In 1797 he supervised the building of the &quot;USS Constitution&quot; (&quot;Old Iron Sides&quot;) at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts. Talbot commanded the &quot;USS Constitution&quot;, largely in the West Indies, from 1799 to 1801, when he retired from the U.S. Navy.

=== Daniel Cady ===
One of the men who shaped Fulton County was Judge Daniel Cady, a prominent Johnstown resident. Sometimes called &quot;the father of Fulton County&quot;, Cady named the new county after Robert Fulton, who was related by marriage to Cady&#x27;s wife, Margaret Livingston. Robert Fulton, an inventor, is perhaps best known for devising the improvements that made steamboats commercially viable.

Judge Daniel Cady was one of Johnstown&#x27;s most important citizens. With indirect connections by marriage to John Jacob Astor and that family&#x27;s lucrative fur business interests, Daniel Cady, adept at managing these connections and his own business interests, joined the ranks of the wealthiest landowners in New York. After moving to Johnstown in 1799, he married Margaret Livingston, whose father, Col. James Livingston, fought in the Continental Army at the battles of Quebec and Saratoga during the American Revolution. Col. Livingston frustrated Benedict Arnold&#x27;s attempted treason by firing on &quot;The Vulture&quot;, the boat intended to carry Arnold to safety. A public servant as well as an astute lawyer and businessman, Judge Cady served in the New York state legislature from 1808 until 1814. In 1814 he was elected as a Federalist to one term in the United States House of Representatives. In 1816, he returned to Johnstown from Washington and resumed legal practice. He later served as a judge on the New York Supreme Court, Fourth District, from 1847 until 1855. Cady died in Johnstown in 1859 and is buried in the cemetery there.

===John D. McDonald===
John D. McDonald (1816â1900) was born in Johnstown. Orphaned at 12, he took off for the Wisconsin Territory at age 20, where he was a farmer (lived on the same farm for 63 years) and served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and in various local offices.

=== Israel T. Hatch ===
Hatch was born in Johnstown. He became mayor of Buffalo, New York and a U.S. House of Representatives member. He was a law partner with Henry K. Smith, who also became a mayor of Buffalo.

=== Elizabeth Cady Stanton ===
Daniel Cady is today perhaps best known as the father of the prominent women&#x27;s rights activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was born in Johnstown in 1815. Stanton, who later worked in partnership with Susan B. Anthony and served for many years as president of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), spent her childhood in Johnstown, where she studied at the Johnstown Academy. It was one of the first schools in New York to receive a teaching certificate issued by the newly formed state education system in the later 19th century. After leaving to continue her education in Troy, New York, Stanton returned to Johnstown with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer and abolitionist who studied law under her father, Daniel Cady. Because of her role, Johnstown, together with Seneca Falls, New York, where Elizabeth Cady Stanton helped organize the first Women&#x27;s Rights Convention held in 1848, lays claim to being the birthplace of the women&#x27;s rights movement in the United States. Stanton&#x27;s speech, the Declaration of Sentiments, given at the Seneca Falls convention and modeled on the Declaration of Independence, is generally credited with instigating the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in the United States.

=== George Linius Streeter ===

George Linius Streeter was a noted embryologist and Director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Son of George Austin Streeter, a glove-maker.

<text>Mayfield is a town in Fulton County, New York, United States, northeast of Gloversville and Johnstown. The town contains a village also named Mayfield. The population of the town was 6,495 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The land that is now the town was formed by part of the Mayfield Patent of 1770; also the Daniel Claus Patent; McLeod&#x27;s Patent; and significant portions of the Sacandaga Patent; the Glen, Bleecker, and Lansing Patent; and the Kingsborough Patent. First settlement began by Sir William Johnson in the spring of 1760. A section known as Philadelphia Bush formed in the southern part of the present town about 1765, and a settlement around the old Mayfield Corners began after Johnson erected a grist mill on the Mayfield creek, c.1773. The settlements were situated on the war path taken by Sir John Johnson and his raiding parties during the Revolutionary War, which devastated the early pioneers. A fort, known as the Sacandaga Blockhouse, was erected in May of 1779 to protect the remaining settlers from further raids. However, the Mayfield area was mostly abandoned by the end of the war. The town was established in 1793 from the town of Caughnawaga in Montgomery County before the formation of Fulton County in 1838. It was one of the first three such towns formed. Part of Mayfield was taken in 1805 to form the town of Wells (now in Hamilton County). An additional part of Mayfield was added to Wells in 1812. Mayfield was reduced once again in 1842 to form the town of Perth. The early economy was based on lumber and leather production. The Oliver Rice House located on Old NY 30 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.

<text>Batavia is a town in Genesee County, New York, United States. The population was 6,293 at the 2020 census. The name is derived from the Roman name for part of the Netherlands.

The Town of Batavia was formed in 1802 along with the county. Batavia is centrally located in the county. The City of Batavia is surrounded by the town, but not part of the town.

At that time the county and its coterminous town encompassed most of western New York. The regional office of the Holland Land Company, the owner of all this territory, was located in the town, in the Village of Batavia, founded by Joseph Ellicott, the company&#x27;s land agent. As other counties and towns were created, the territory of both the county and Town of Batavia shrank to its current size.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 48.4Â square miles (125.4Â km2), of which 48.2Â square miles (124.8Â km2) is land and 0.2Â square mile (0.6Â km2) (0.45%) is water.

The Tonawanda Creek flows westward through the town, and the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes across the town.

=== Adjacent towns and areas ===

<text>Bergen ( ) is a village in Genesee County, New York, United States. The population was 1,176 at the 2010 census.

The village lies on the eastern edge of the town of Bergen. The village is north of the junction of Routes 19 and 33.

==History==
&quot;See also Bergen (town), New York&quot;.
The Bergen area was opened up in 1801 when a road was hacked through the thick &quot;Northwoods&quot; from LeRoy to Lake Ontario. (In its early days of settlement, Bergen was called &quot;Northwoods&quot;.) Bergen was first settled in 1801 by Samuel Lincoln. In the same year George Letson, William Letson, Benajah Worden, Richard Abbey, Solomon Levi, Jesse Leach, James Letson, Gideon Elliott, and David Scott settled in town.

A colony of 60 families from Connecticut settled the area along Route 19 from Fort Hill (near Parmalee Road) to Black Creek from 1805 to 1810. The first store was a mile south of Route 33 on Route 19 on the east side of the road. The first group of stores was located from the intersection of Lake Road (Route 19) and Route 262 to the intersection of Route 19 and the Scottsville Road (Route 33A). This area was called &quot;Buell&#x27;s Corner&quot;, later &quot;Bergen Corners&quot; or &quot;High Bergen&quot;. The first church organization was established in December 1807. The Congregational church was founded January 25, 1808. Harry Kelsey, a graduate of Yale College, taught the first school. The first frame house in the town was erected by Levi Ward, a pioneer physician. Jared Merritt built the first sawmill. Dr. Ward was proprietor of the first store, in 1808. The first inn was opened in 1809 by Samuel Butler. Colonel W.H. Ward was the first postmaster.

After the railroad came through in 1836, an area was laid out around the intersection of Lake Road (Route 19) and the railroad for businesses and houses. It was called &quot;Wardville&quot; after the Levi Ward family who laid it out. It was also called &quot;Cork&quot;, after the Irish who settled there while and after the building of the railroad, and &quot;Lower Bergen&quot;. The two areas were soon connected by residences and churches.
Fire initially destroyed the business area around the railroad tracks in 1866.

This area, along with the surrounding residences, was incorporated in on March 5, 1877, as the Village of Bergen. The village is near the center of the eastern boundary line, on the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad.

Fire destroyed the business area around the railroad tracks again in 1880. The Village Board passed an ordinance requiring that all structures in this area should be built of brick, stone, or wrought iron.

The west side of the district south of the railroad is on the National Register as the Lake Street Historic District due to its 1880 wrought-iron storefronts, transom windows and probably, also, because of the famous family who founded &quot;Wardville&quot;. Some of the family went on from Bergen to the Rochester area and were primary developers of that area.

Due to better building material and firefighting equipment, another fire in 1906 destroyed only some of the buildings on the west side of the street. A fire in 1932 leveled some of the buildings on the east side of the street. Since then, fires in individual buildings have caused some alteration of their facades.

<text>Bergen is a town in Genesee County, New York, United States. The town is in the northeastern corner of the county. The population was 3,120 at the 2010 census. There is also a village of Bergen in the town.

== History ==

Bergen is one of the mid-sized towns in Genesee County. It was part of the Triangle Tract and the 100,000 Acre Tract (or the Connecticut Tract) in the Morris Reserve. It is a portion of the triangular tract sold to Le Roy and others from the Morris Reserve, and it contains two tiers of lots from the Connecticut tract. The latter are in the western part of the town. The community was named for a city on the west coast of Norway.

The Bergen area was opened up in 1801 when a road was hacked through the thick &quot;Northwoods&quot; region from LeRoy to Lake Ontario. (In its early days of settlement, Bergen was in fact called &quot;Northwoods&quot;.) Bergen was first settled in 1801 by Samuel Lincoln. In the same year George Letson, William Letson, Benajah Worden, Richard Abbey, Solomon Levi, Jesse Leach, James Letson, Gideon Elliott and David Scott settled in town. A colony of 60 families from Connecticut settled the area along present-day Route 19 from Fort Hill (near Parmalee Road) to Black Creek between 1805 and 1810. The first store was a mile south of current Route 33 on Route 19 on the east side of the road. The first group of stores was located from the intersection of Lake Road (Route 19) and Route 262 to the intersection of Route 19 and Scottsville Road (Route 33A). This area was called &quot;Buell&#x27;s Corner&quot;, later &quot;Bergen Corners&quot; or &quot;High Bergen&quot;. The first church organization was established in December 1807. The Congregational church was founded January 25, 1808. Harry Kelsey, a graduate of Yale College, taught the first school. The first frame house in the town was erected by Dr. Levi Ward, the pioneer physician. Jared Merritt built the first sawmill. Dr. Ward was also proprietor of the first store, in 1808. The first inn was opened in 1809 by Samuel Butler. Colonel W. H. Ward was the first postmaster.

Bergen was erected from the town of Murray (which was divided into three towns) on April 2, 1813. It was also part of the town of Northampton. The town of Byron was part of Bergen until 1820.

After the railroad came through in 1836, an area was laid out around the intersection of Lake Road (Route 19) and the railroad for businesses and houses. It was called &quot;Wardville&quot; after the Levi Ward family who laid it out. It was also called &quot;Cork&quot;, after the Irish who settled there during and after the building of the railroad, and &quot;Lower Bergen&quot;. The two areas were soon connected by residences and churches.

Fire initially destroyed the business area around the railroad tracks in 1866.

This area, along with the surrounding residences, was incorporated in on March 5, 1877, as the village of Bergen. The village of Bergen is located near the center of the eastern boundary line, on the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad.

Fire destroyed the business area around the railroad tracks again in 1880. The Village Board passed an ordinance requiring that all structures in this area should be built of brick or stone or wrought iron.

The west side of the district south of the railroad is on the National Register of Historic Places due to its 1880 wrought-iron store fronts, transom windows and probably, also, because of the famous family who founded &quot;Wardville&quot;. Some of the family went on from Bergen to the Rochester area and were also primary developers of that area.

Due to the building material and better fire fighting equipment, a fire in 1906 destroyed only some of the buildings on the west side of the street. A fire in 1932 leveled some of the buildings on the east side of the street. Since then fires in individual buildings have caused some alteration of the facade of the buildings.

When glaciers of the fourth ice age retreated from the northeast corner of New York State 125,000 years ago, they left behind of forested wetlands now known as the Bergen Swamp. The three-mile (5Â km) long wildlife area is home to dozens of species of unusual birds, reptiles and rare flowers that thrive in an undisturbed, natural environment.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.6Â square miles (71.6Â km2), of which 27.6Â squareÂ miles (71.6Â km2) is land and 0.04% is water.

Bergen Swamp, a glacial feature now kept as a wildlife preserve, is home to a small endangered rattlesnake, the Eastern Massasauga, as well as a large diversity of other species.

The eastern town line is the border of Monroe County, and the northern town line is the border of both Monroe County and Orleans County.

Interstate 490 passes through the southeast part of the town.

<text>Le Roy, or more commonly LeRoy, is a town in Genesee County, New York, United States. The population was 7,662 at the time of the 2020 census. The town is named after one of the original land owners, Herman Le Roy. The town lies on the southwestern edge of Monroe County. Within the town is a village of Le Roy. The Jell-O gelatin dessert was invented and first manufactured in Le Roy.

== History ==
The area was first settled in 1793. The town of Le Roy was established in 1812 as the &quot;Town of Bellona&quot; from part of the town of Caledonia (Livingston County). The name was later changed to &quot;Le Roy&quot; in 1813, after New York City merchant and land speculator Herman LeRoy.

The Jell-O gelatin dessert was invented and first manufactured in Le Roy, and the Jell-O Museum is located in the town. General Foods closed the Jell-O factory in 1964 and relocated to Dover, Delaware.

Le Roy was the home of Calvin Keeney, who was the first breeder to successfully produce a stringless green bean.

Le Roy also has a 100-inch tall, 290 lb. replica of the Statue of Liberty located on Wolcott Street on the banks of Oatka creek.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 42.2Â square miles (109.2Â km), all land.

The east town line is the border of Monroe and Livingston counties.

Oatka Creek, a tributary of the Genesee River, flows northward through the town and was a source of water power for early mills. The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes across the northern part of the town. The western terminus of Interstate 490 is also here.

The town rests atop the Onondaga Formation which forms an escarpment that faces north and runs east/west, just north of the village. The limestone rock is highly fossiliferous, of Devonian age, and extensively quarried. It is used for road building as crushed rock, and for the manufacture of portland cement. In the eastern part of the town is a community named Lime Rock.

== 2011 illness outbreak ==
Beginning in August 2011, 14 students (13 girls and one boy) from the LeRoy Junior-Senior High School began reporting perplexing medical symptoms including verbal outbursts, tics, seizure activity and speech difficulty. In mid-January, five days after a community meeting in which the New York State Department of Health stated their diagnosis could not be revealed publicly due to privacy concerns, two of the girls appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot; to discuss their frustration with not getting adequate answers.

The next day, Laszlo Mechtler, a neurologist treating most of the girls, was given permission to share the diagnosis of conversion disorder and mass psychogenic illness. Unsatisfied with the investigation&#x27;s results, the girls and their parents spoke out publicly against their diagnosis, stating they believed the situation warranted further scrutiny from outside sources. Alternative medical theories were suggested, including Tourette syndrome and PANDAS, which Mechtler and his team ruled out. Erin Brockovich, noted environmental activist, was called to town to investigate environmental pollution from the 1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment as a possible cause. During this time, many of the girls appeared in the local and national media, as well as posting on social media. As this happened, the illness spread to 20 individuals. Eventually, as doctors encouraged their patients to stay away from the media and the media attention died down, many of the girls&#x27; symptoms improved. By the end of the school year in June, one girl was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, and most of the girls who received treatment for conversion disorder were healthy in time for graduation. No environmental causes were found after repeated testing around the school and surrounding areas of town.

Bartholomew, Wessely and Rubin questioned in 2012 whether interaction on social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Internet blogs) contributed to mass psychogenic illness when the adolescent girls reported tic-like movements. Bartholomew &quot;et al&quot; reported twitching epidemics in the US as early as 1939, and wrote that the Leroy outbreak was the &quot;third recorded school outbreak of conversion disorder with motor disturbances to occur in the USA since 2002&quot;, but the first in which reports of affected individuals spread via social networks.

==Notable people==
* Seth M. Gates, former U.S. congressman from New York
* Ruth Webster Lathrop, physician, medical college professor in Philadelphia
* Erin K. O&#x27;Shea, President of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) and Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University
* Pearle Bixby Waite, native Le Roy man who invented the modern recipe for JELL-O. His wife is noted for coining the name. Jell-O 1-2-3.

==Electric power facilities==
===New Athens Generating===
Pursuant to Article X of the Public Service Law, Athens Generating Company, L.P. (now operating as New Athens Generating Company, LLC) was granted a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need for a 1,080-megawatt (MW) combined cycle natural gas powered plant in 2000. It went into service in 2004. There are three combustion turbines whose exhaust creates steam to drive a steam turbine. All of the combustion turbines are manufactured by Siemens. It uses a wet/dry (hybrid) cooling system consisting of three groups of six hybrid cooling units. It is located on a 150-acre area that was zoned as light industrial, to the west of the Village of Athens. In 2017, it injected 3,891 GWh of electric energy into the electric transmission system. This is equivalent to operating at full capacity for approximately 40.4% of the year. For comparison, the capital region consumed 11,823 GWh of electric energy in 2017.

The plant has reorganized and transferred ownership several times since it was granted a certificate in 2000. As of 2018 it is owned by New Athens Generating Company, LLC, which is owned by New Mach Gen, LLC, which is owned by Mach Gen, LLC, which is owned by Talen Energy Supply, LLC, which is owned by Riverstone Holdings LLC. It was noted in a recent declaratory ruling that Con Edison has a bilateral agreement with New Athens Generating Company whereby Con Edison buys the plant&#x27;s output and sells it in the NYISO wholesale market. In its 2017-2018 adopted budget, the Village of Athens noted a revenue of about $9,000 from payments in lieu of taxes most of which can be assumed to come from New Athens Generating Company, LLC. For comparison, the Village of Athens noted a total budget of about $2.15 million for 2017-2018.

===West Point Partners===
A High Voltage Direct Current underground transmission line was proposed in an Article VII filing with the Public Service Commission in 2013. Its northern converter station would have been located adjacent to the New Athens Generating facility. The certification process was placed in limbo after the real estate for its planned southern converter station near the Indian Point Energy Center was sold in private auction from Con Edison to the Town of Cortlandt.

==In popular culture==
A major plot point in &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (2005) took place in Athens. In the movie, most of the town is shown being destroyed. These are the scenes where the flaming train passes by the cast and the crowd is going towards the ferry.
