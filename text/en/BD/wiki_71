<text>The culture of [[Moldova]] is unique and influenced by the Romanian origins of its majority population, as well as the Slavic and minority Gagauz populations. The traditional Latin origins of Romanian culture reach back to the 2nd century, the period of Roman colonization in Dacia.

During the centuries following the Roman withdrawal in 271, the population of the region was influenced by contact with the Byzantine Empire, Slavic peoples, Hungarian people, and later by the Ottoman Turks. Slavic migration into the region began in the 6th century and continued gradually through the early 19th century. A heavy Polish influence occurred from the 14th through 16th centuries, when the Principality of Moldova was connected to Poland by a trade route and was briefly a vassal of the Kingdom of Poland. Since the 18th century, several waves of Poles emigrated to the land which constitutes the majority of modern Moldova. Beginning in the 19th century, a strong Western European (particularly French) influence came to be evident in literature and the arts. The resulting melting pot has produced a rich cultural tradition. Although foreign contact was an inevitable consequence of the region&#x27;s geographical location, their influence only served to enhance a vital and resilient popular culture. Despite the many foreign influences on Moldovan culture, the country&#x27;s traditional Romanian roots remain strong.

The population of what once was the Principality of Moldavia (1359–1859) had come to identify itself widely as &quot;Moldovan&quot; by the 14th century, but continued to maintain close cultural links with other Romanian groups. After 1812, the eastern Moldovans, those inhabiting Bessarabia and Transnistria, were also influenced by Slavic culture during the periods of 1812–1917, and during 1940–1989 they were influenced by Russia.

The geographical area that is now modern Moldova was formed under the conditions of contacts with the East Slavic population, and later under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. In 1812, the territory of modern Moldova was liberated from Ottoman rule and incorporated into the Bessarabian province of the Russian Empire, which had a great influence on the development of the culture of the region. After the October Revolution in 1918, Romania annexed the nation for 22 years, and the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed on the left bank of the Dniester, as a result of which culture developed under a stronger Russian influence under Soviet administrative control, as well as by ethnic Russian or Russian-speaking immigration.

By 1918, Bessarabia was one of the least developed, and least educated European regions of the Russian Empire. Although Soviet authorities promoted education, the region&#x27;s cultural ties with Romania were slowly eroded due to administrative policies. With many ethnic Romanian intellectuals, either fleeing, being killed after 1940, or being deported both during and after World War II, Bessarabia&#x27;s cultural and educational situation changed drastically and became more Russified.

After the 1960s, Soviet authorities developed urban cultural and scientific institutions that were subsequently filled with Russians, and diverse ethnic groups from across the Soviet Union. Much of the urban culture came from Moscow, while the primarily rural ethnic Romanian population was allowed to express itself in folklore and folk art.

==Folk culture==
Although the folk arts flourished, similarities with Romanian culture were hidden. Music and dance, particularly encouraged by Soviet authorities, were made into a showcase, but were subtly changed to hide their Romanian origins. For example, the national folk costume, in which the traditional Romanian moccasin (&quot;opinca&quot;) was replaced by the Russian boot.

Moldova&#x27;s traditional folk culture is very rich. The ancient folk ballads, such as &quot;Mioriţa&quot; and &quot;Meşterul Manole&quot;, play a central role in this traditional culture. Folk traditions, including ceramics and weaving, continue to be practiced in rural areas. The folk culture tradition is promoted at the national level and is represented by, among other groups, the folk choir, Doina.

==Literary culture==

The first books, religious texts, of the Principality of Moldavia appeared in the mid-17th century. Prominent figures in Moldavia&#x27;s cultural development include Dosoftei, Grigore Ureche, Miron Costin, metropolitan of Kiev Petru Movilă, scholars Nicolae Milescu-Spãtaru, Dimitrie Cantemir (1673–1723), and Ion Neculce, Gavriil Bănulescu-Bodoni, Alexandru Donici, Constantin Stamati, Costache Negruzzi, historian and philologist Bogdan P. Hasdeu (1836–1907), author Ion Creangă (1837–1889), and poet Mihai Eminescu (1850–1889). 

Varlaam published the first books. Dosoftei founded numerous schools and published a lot. Cantemir wrote the first thorough geographical, ethnographical, and economic description of Moldavia in &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot; (Berlin, c. 1714). 

Modern writers include Vladimir Beşleagă, Nicolae Dabija, Ion Druţă, Victor Teleucă,Victor Ciobanu and Grigore Vieru. In 1991, a total of 520 books were published in Moldova, of which 402 were in Romanian, 108 in Russian, eight in Gagauz, and two in Bulgarian.

In the early 1990s, Moldova had twelve professional theaters. All performed in Romanian, except the A.P. Chekhov Russian Drama Theater in Chişinău, and the Russian Drama and Comedy Theater in Tiraspol, both of which performed solely in Russian, and the Licurici Republic Puppet Theater, in Chişinău, which performed in both Romanian and Russian. Members of ethnic minorities manage a number of folklore groups and amateur theaters throughout the country.

==Cuisine==

Moldovan cuisine consists mainly of traditional European foods, such as beef, pork, potatoes, cabbage, cheese, and a variety of cereal grains. Popular alcoholic beverages are &quot;divin&quot; (Moldovan brandy), beer, and local wine.

Very popular dishes include &quot;manti&quot; (a type of dumpling filled with meat and vegetables, which is wrapped in a dough wrapper, and served with a spicy sour cream), &quot;ciorbă&quot; (a sour soup consisting of meat and vegetables, served with sauerkraut, polenta, or rice), &quot;pelmeni&quot; (another type of dumpling, filled with meat and onions, but sometimes mushrooms, turnips, and sauerkraut are added), &quot;borscht&quot; (made with beets, tomatoes, and other vegetables to form a stew), and &quot;sarma&quot; (a dish made with stuffed cabbage rolls, accompanied by sauerkraut and &quot;mămăligă&quot;).

Other common foods in Moldova include grilled meats, other grains, dairy products, and &quot;mămăligă&quot; (a type of polenta made with cornmeal, and mashed into a porridge).

<doc id="265848" wikidata="Q192779" url="?curid=265848" title="Tupolev Tu-16">
<text>The Tupolev Tu-16 (USAF/DOD reporting name Type 39; NATO reporting name: [[Badger]]) is a twin-engined jet strategic heavy bomber used by the Soviet Union. It has been flown for almost 70 years. While many aircraft in Soviet service were retired after the Cold War ended, the Chinese license-built version Xian H-6 remains in service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force, with the most modern variant, the H-6K, still being actively produced .

==Development==
In the late 1940s, the Soviet Union was strongly committed to matching the United States in strategic bombing capability. The Soviets&#x27; only long-range bomber at the time was Tupolev&#x27;s Tu-4 &quot;Bull&quot;, a reverse-engineered copy of the American B-29 Superfortress. The development of the notably powerful Mikulin AM-3 turbojet led to the possibility of a large, jet-powered bomber.

The Tupolev design bureau began work on the Tu-88 (&quot;Aircraft N&quot;) prototypes in 1950. The Tu-88 first flew on 27 April 1952. After winning a competition against the Ilyushin Il-46, it was approved for production in December 1952. The first production bombers entered service with Frontal Aviation in 1954, receiving the service designation Tu-16. It received the NATO reporting name Badger-A.

It had a new, large swept wing and two large Mikulin AM-3 turbojets, one in each wing root. It could carry a single massive FAB-9000 bomb (the Russian equivalent in terms of size of the British Grand Slam, but a conventional bomb rather than a deep ground penetrator) or various nuclear weapons for a range of around . Production took place in three aviation plants, Kazan Aircraft Production Association, Kuybyshev, and Voronezh Aircraft Production Association.

Although the Tu-16 began as a high-altitude, free-fall bomber, in the mid-1950s, it was equipped to carry early Soviet cruise missiles. The Tu-16KS-1 (Badger-B) version could carry AS-1 missiles over a combat radius of . These very large weapons were aerodynamically similar to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter, fitted with either a nuclear or conventional warhead, having a range of about . They were intended for use primarily against US Navy aircraft carriers and other large surface ships. Subsequent Tu-16s were converted to carry later, more advanced missiles, while their designations changed several times.

A versatile design, the Tu-16 was built in numerous specialized variants for aerial reconnaissance, maritime surveillance, electronic intelligence gathering (ELINT), and electronic warfare (ECM). In total, 1,507 aircraft were constructed in three plants in the Soviet Union, in 1954–1962. A civilian adaptation, the Tupolev Tu-104, saw passenger service with Aeroflot. The Tu-16 was also exported to Indonesia, Egypt, and Iraq. It continued to be used by the Air Forces and naval aviation of the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia, until 1993.

Delivery of the Tu-16 to China began in 1958, and the Xi&#x27;an Aircraft Industrial Corporation license-produced the aircraft under the Chinese designation Xian H-6. At least 120 of these aircraft remain in service. On 14 May 1965, one of the PLAAF Tu-16 bombers carried out the first airborne nuclear weapon test inside China.

==Variants==



Among the main production variants of the Badger were the Tu-16 and Tu-16A bombers and Tu-16KS and Tu-16K-10 missile carriers, Tu-16SPS, &quot;Elka&quot;, and Tu-16Ye ECM aircraft, Tu-16R reconnaissance aircraft, and Tu-16T torpedo bombers; others were produced from conversions. Individual aircraft could be modified several times, with designations changed, especially concerning missile-carrying aircraft.

* &quot;Aircraft 88&quot; – Initial prototype.
* &quot;Aircraft 97&quot; – Twin-engined long-range bomber development project of Tu-16 with two RD-5 engines.
* &quot;Aircraft 103&quot; – Supersonic bomber development project of Tu-16 with four VD-7 AM-13 engines.
* Badger A (Tu-16) – This is the basic configuration of the Tu-16 bomber deployed in 1954 to replace the Tu-4. Several modified models of this variant existed, all of which were known as Badger A in the West.
** Tu-16A – Modified Tu-16s designed to carry nuclear bombs, one of main versions, with 453 built. Many of these were subsequently converted into other variants.
** Tu-16Z – An early specialized version of the Tu-16 that served as airborne tankers (a refuelling method: wing-to-wing), though retaining their medium bomber role.
** Tu-16G (Tu-104G) – Fast air mail model, Aeroflot aircrew training version.
** Tu-16N – A dedicated tanker version for Tu-22/Tu-22M bombers, with probe and drogue system. Entered service in 1963. Similar aircraft Tu-16NN converted from Tu-16Z.
** Tu-16T – Limited production maritime strike version (torpedo bomber), that served in the Soviet Naval Aviation, and carried torpedoes, mines and depth charges. 76 built and some more converted. All units subsequently converted into Tu-16S configuration.
** Tu-16S – A lifeboat carrier version used for search and rescue operations.
** Tu-16Ye – These were equipped with heavy electronic warfare and electronic intelligence (ELINT) equipment.
* Badger B (Tu-16KS) – Variant designed as a launch platform for two AS-1 Kennel/KS-1 Komet missiles. 107 built in 1954–1958, served with the Soviet Naval Aviation, Egypt and Indonesia. Soviet ones later converted with newer missiles.
* Badger C (Tu-16K-10) – Another Naval Aviation variant, units of this version carried a single AS-2 Kipper/K-10S anti-ship missile. 216 built in 1958–1963. It differed from other variants in having a radar in a nose. A further development, the Tu-16K-10-26, carried a single K-10S and two KSR-2 or KSR-5 AS-6 Kingfish missiles (K-26 missile complex). Some were later converted into ELINT platforms.
* Badger D (Tu-16RM-1) – Maritime reconnaissance model with ELINT equipment; 23 converted from Tu-16K-10. It retained its radar in a nose and could guide K-10S missiles, fired from other planes, at targets.
* Badger E (Tu-16R) – Reconnaissance version of the airframe, with ELINT equipment, first of all meant for maritime reconnaissance. It could guide KS missiles.
** Tu-16RM-2 – modified Tu-16R, serving in the Naval Aviation. It could guide KSR-2 missiles.
** Tu-16KRM – Launch platforms for target drones (a variant of Tu-16K-26).
* Badger F (Tu-16RM-2) – Another reconnaissance version based on the −16R/RM but with the addition of external ELINT equipment.
* Badger G (Tu-16K/Tu-16KSR) – Serving in the Naval Aviation, these were conversions from earlier models. These were designed to carry bombs in internal bays in addition to carrying air-to-surface missiles externally, such as the AS-5 Kelt and AS-6 Kingfish. There existed numerous variants, designated either from carried missile complex (K-11, K-16 and K-26) or from missiles of these complexes (KSR-11, KSR-2 and KSR-5). Following further modifications, they were also given suffixes. Main variants:
**Tu-16KSR-2 – carrying the K-16 complex (two KSR-2 missiles). Used from 1962. Similar aircraft, converted from other variants, were designated Tu-16K-16.
**Tu-16K-11-16 – carrying the K-16 complex (KSR-2 missiles) or the K-11 complex (two anti-radar KSR-11 missiles). Used from 1962. Similar aircraft were designated Tu-16KSR-2-11. Over 440 Tu-16 could carry the K-16 or K-11 complex.
**Tu-16K-26 – carrying the K-26 complex (two KSR-5 missiles), retaining a capability of KSR-2 and 11 missiles. Used from 1969. Similar aircraft were designated Tu-16KSR-2-5-11 or Tu-16KSR-2-5 (no KSR-11 capability). Over 240 Tu-16 could carry the K-26 complex.
**Tu-16K-26P – carrying the K-26P missiles (two anti-radar KSR-5P missiles, as well as KSR-5, 2 or 11).
* Badger H (Tu-16 Elka) – Designed for stand-off electronic warfare and electronic counter-measures support.
* Badger J (Tu-16P Buket) – Another electronic warfare variant configured as an ECM strike escort.

==Notable accidents==
* On 25 May 1968 a Soviet Air Force Tu-16 Badger-F piloted by Colonel Andrey Pliyev buzzed the US Navy aircraft carrier in the Norwegian Sea. The Tu-16 made four passes, and on the last a wing clipped the sea and it crashed with no survivors. Parts of three bodies were recovered by the US.

<doc id="265850" wikidata="Q960737" url="?curid=265850" title="William B. Bankhead">
<text>William Brockman Bankhead (April 12, 1874 – September 15, 1940) was an American politician who served as the 42nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1936 to 1940, representing Alabama&#x27;s 10th and later 7th congressional districts as a Democrat from 1917 to 1940. Bankhead was a strong liberal and a prominent supporter of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal of pro-labor union legislation, thus clashing with most other Southern Democrats in Congress at the time. Bankhead described himself as proud to be a politician, by which he meant that he did not neglect matters that concerned his district or reelection. He was the father of actress Tallulah Bankhead.

Bankhead died on September 15, 1940, from an abdominal hemorrhage, while still in office.

==Early life==

Bankhead was born at the Bankhead plantation in Lamar County, Alabama. His father, John H. Bankhead, was an active politician who had served in the Alabama legislature, and later as US Representative and Senator. His mother was Tallulah James Brockman, granddaughter of South Carolina state Senator Thomas Patterson Brockman, and he was raised as a Methodist. Bankhead&#x27;s brother, John H. Bankhead II, also served in the Senate.

William Bankhead attended the University of Alabama, where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and played on the university&#x27;s first football team, organized in 1892. He studied law at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, DC, graduating in 1895.

He was immediately admitted to the bar in Alabama, and practiced law in Huntsville.

==Political career==
In 1898, he became city attorney of Huntsville, serving until 1902. In 1900, he was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives for one term, serving through 1901.

In 1905, he moved to Jasper, Alabama. In 1910 he was appointed solicitor of the fourteenth judicial circuit of Alabama, serving until 1914.

In 1914, he sought the Democratic nomination for US Representative, but failed. In 1916 he was elected Representative from the newly created 10th Congressional District. (Alabama was apportioned a tenth Congressional seat after the 1910 Census, but the seat was filled by at-large election in 1912 and 1914.) Bankhead held the 10th District until it was abolished after the 1930 Census, when Alabama lost a seat. He was the only person ever elected from the 10th District.

After reapportionment and redistricting following the 1930 Census, Bankhead was re-elected Representative from the 7th District in 1932, and was re-elected three times, serving until his death in 1940. Bankhead served as chairman of the House Rules Committee from April 1934 until January 1935, taking over for Edward W. Pou who died in office. In 1934, he was chosen House Majority Leader by his fellow Democrats. On June 4, 1936, he was chosen Speaker of the House to succeed Jo Byrns, who had died that morning. Bankhead served as Speaker until his death on September 15, 1940. His cause of death was a stomach hemorrhage.

As Speaker, Bankhead held the second-highest political office ever attained by any Alabamian, after only Vice President William R. King.

At the 1940 Democratic National Convention (three months before his death), he finished second to Henry A. Wallace on the vice presidential ticket, losing the delegate count 626–329.

==Bankhead family==
Bankhead&#x27;s father, John H. Bankhead, was a U.S. Representative and Senator. His elder brother John H. Bankhead II was also a U.S. Senator, and his nephew Walter Will Bankhead was a U.S. Representative. His daughter, Tallulah Bankhead, was the acclaimed theatrical, radio and motion picture actress.

The William B. Bankhead National Forest and sections of old US Highway 78 in northern Alabama are named in his honor. His home in Jasper has been renovated to house the Walker Area Community Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Bankhead House and Heritage Center&quot;, a history museum and arts venue.

<text>The General Police Inspectorate () is the national civilian police force of the Republic of Moldova. It is a state institution subordinated to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, that regulates law enforcement in Moldova. The current Chief of the General Police Inspectorate is currently Viorel Cernăuțeanu.

== History ==
The GPI was established as the Police of the Republic of Moldova on 13 September 1990, after the Government of Moldova adopted resolution no. 321 &quot;On the reform of the bodies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moldovan SSR&quot;, which provided for the creation of the police and district police stations. Thus, the place of the Soviet-era militia was occupied by the new police.

On 18 December 1990, the Parliament of Moldova adopted the Law on police. In 1995 the national police of Moldova were under the direction of the Ministry of Interior. Internal troops were reported to have 2,500 men, and the numbers of riot police were put at 900. The scope and quality of Moldova&#x27;s state security apparatus were difficult to determine. Like the armed forces, local assets of the former Moldavian KGB were transferred to the new government along with those personnel who wished to enter the service of the new government. These elements functioned at the time under the republic&#x27;s Ministry of National Security before being transferred to the MAI.

On 27 December 2012, a law which entered into force on 5 March 2013 established the General Police Inspectorate under the MIA. On 24 April 2013, the new police uniform was approved. On 8 April 2014, the Strategic Development Program was approved, a basic document of the Police, elaborated for a period of 3 years, which ensures the prioritization of the various objectives for the IGP.

== Organization ==

As a law enforcement body of state power, the police of the Republic of Moldova are divided into state and municipal. State police perform their duties throughout the republic, municipal - in the territory of the corresponding administrative unit. State and municipal police carry out their tasks in close cooperation. The State Police provides the municipal police with methodological and advisory assistance, as well as assists in the implementation of the duties assigned to it by their own forces and means. The municipal police assist the state police in carrying out operational investigative measures, timely inform them of the persons and facts of interest to them.

Institutions under the GPI are:
*National Inspectorate of Investigations
*National Inspectorate for Public Security
*Police Department of Chisinau Municipality
*General Directorate of Criminal Investigation
*Special Forces Brigade &quot;Fulger&quot;
*Chinologic Center
*Technical-Forensic Center and Judicial Expertise
*Center for International Police Cooperation (Interpol)
*Judicial Police
*Procurement and Logistics Service
*Directorate of Inspection
*42 police inspectorates at district level

==Recognition==
On the inspectorate&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2017, the Police Directorate of the Chisinau Municipality was awarded by President Igor Dodon the Order of Ștefan cel Mare.

=== Uniform ===
The IGP has a summer outfit, a spring-autumn outfit and a winter outfit. The parade dress is worn during the participation in the festivities (taking the oath, awarding of ministerial and departmental distinctions, march pasts, national holidays, and official receptions).

== Controversial issues ==

=== Public perception ===
The common lack of respect towards law, in general, among Moldovans results in a predominant distrust for police. This is not helped by the fact that police incompetency due to various reasons is frequent.

=== Ill-treatment by police ===
Moldova is not a part of the EU, but as of 2024, it started negotiations after it applied for membership in 2022. According to Amnesty International in October 2007, torture and ill-treatment in Moldova remain widespread and systemic despite some initial legislative steps made by the government to change police practices in order to eradicate it. &quot;Although efforts have been made to bring legislation into line with international and European standards, practice and attitudes are lagging behind. Beatings and abuse of detainees remain the norm. Channels for seeking redress stay blocked. Lack of transparency breeds impunity,&quot; Amnesty Internationals researcher said. The events during the April 2009 Moldova civil unrest have drawn criticism of human rights violations, including in regard to the deaths of Valeriu Boboc, Ion Ţâbuleac, and Eugen Ţapu.

<text>Crime in Moldova, as everywhere in the Post-Soviet states, has risen in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, although in recent years there has been an improvement. Corruption in Moldova, economic and drug-related crimes are the most visible and predictable results of the deteriorating economic situation. Racketeering and the mafia have also risen up during the 1990s and 2000s. Petty crimes, such as pickpocketing and street thefts, are also common.

== Crime by type ==
=== Corruption ===

Corruption in Moldova is one of the country&#x27;s most serious problems. In 2014, $1bn has vanished from three of Moldova&#x27;s leading banks. 

=== Murder ===
In 2023, Moldova had a murder rate of 2.27 per 100,000 population. There were a total of 78 murders in Moldova in 2023. 

Akin to other former Soviet states, Moldova has experienced high crime rates in the 1990s after its independence, with the murder rate reaching a high of 11.4 per 100,000 people in 1992, as well as a value of 10.18 per 100,000 people in 2000, being typically in the range of 8-9 per 100,000 people during the first decade after independence.

=== Drug trade ===
Illicit cultivation of opium poppies and cannabis is carried out in Moldova, mainly for consumption in CIS countries. According to NATO, drug trafficking in Moldova is valued between $200 million to $250 million per year. 

Moldova is a transshipment point for illegal drugs to Western Europe. 

===Human trafficking===
The CIA names human trafficking, widespread crime and underground economic activity among major crime issues of Moldova. Moldova is a source and transit nation in the trafficking in human beings, in particular women and girls into forced prostitution. The annual country human rights report from the United States Department of State pinpoints some involvement by government officials and Moldovan law enforcement in human trafficking.

According to the United States Department of State Trafficking in Persons Report of 2018:

&quot;The Government of Moldova does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. The government demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period; therefore Moldova was upgraded to Tier 2. The government demonstrated increasing efforts by investigating and prosecuting more suspected traffickers, including complicit officials, and increasing budgets for victim protection. However, the government did not meet the minimum standards in several key areas. Identifying victims and conferring official victim status continued to be a challenge. Corruption, particularly in law enforcement and the judiciary, impeded prosecutions and influenced the outcomes of cases, including cases against complicit officials. Victims continued to suffer from intimidation from traffickers, and authorities provided uneven levels of protection during court proceedings.&quot;
E. Benjamin Skinner in his book &quot;A Crime So Monstrous&quot;, on page 156, speculates that between 1991 and 2008, up to 400,000 women were trafficked from Moldova. 

===Human rights violations===

According to Amnesty International, the most common human rights abuses in Moldova are restrictions on freedom of association, unfair trials, torture and other ill-treatment in places of detention, and discrimination against LGBT and Roma minority.

<text>Law enforcement in the People&#x27;s Republic of China consists of an extensive public security system and a variety of enforcement procedures. Along with the courts and procuratorates, the country&#x27;s judicial and public security agencies include the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS), with their descending hierarchy of departments, bureaus (, &quot;Jú&quot;), subbureaus (, &quot;Fù jú&quot;), and stations (, &quot;Suǒ&quot;).

Hong Kong and Macau have separate law enforcement agencies, different legal systems, and are classified as separate jurisdictions under the one country, two systems framework. However, the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) and Public Security Police Force often cooperate with the mainland MPS on cases involving cross border crime.

== Overview ==
The national security system is made up of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP), the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), and the state judicial, procuratorial, and penal systems. The Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission vets all law enforcement officers and legal officials for political reliability.

The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) oversees all domestic police activity in China. The ministry is responsible for police operations and detention centers and has dedicated departments for internal political, economic, and communications security. The Ministry of State Security (MSS) was established in 1983 to ensure &quot;the security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents, spies, and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow China&#x27;s socialist system.&quot; The Ministry of Justice maintains oversees the operation of prisons.

=== Judicial system ===
== Key organizations ==

=== Ministry of Public Security ===
=== People&#x27;s Armed Police ===
=== Chengguan ===
== Police vehicles ==
Police cars in the mainland are white with a dark blue swoosh painted on the side such as BYD e6. China does not have a uniform fleet buying program so local departments typically buy from a variety of local dealerships. Volkswagen Santanas and Volkswagen Passats are the most common but other makes and models are present as well.

<text>The Hawker Hunter is a transonic British jet-powered fighter aircraft that was developed by Hawker Aircraft for the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was designed to take advantage of the newly developed Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engine and the swept wing, and was the first jet-powered aircraft produced by Hawker to be procured by the RAF. On 7 September 1953, the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for aircraft, achieving a speed of .

The single-seat Hunter was introduced to service in 1954 as a manoeuvrable day interceptor aircraft, quickly succeeding first-generation jet fighters in RAF service such as the Gloster Meteor and the de Havilland Venom. The all-weather/night fighter role was filled by the Gloster Javelin. Successively improved variants of the type were produced, adopting increasingly more capable engine models and expanding its fuel capacity amongst other modifications being implemented. Hunters were also used by two RAF display teams: the Black Arrows, who on one occasion looped a record-breaking 22 Hunters in formation, and later the Blue Diamonds, who flew 16 aircraft. The Hunter was also widely exported, serving with a total of 21 overseas air forces.

During the 1960s, following the introduction of the supersonic English Electric Lightning in the interceptor role, the Hunter transitioned to being operated as a fighter-bomber and for aerial reconnaissance missions, using dedicated variants for these purposes. Two-seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the RAF and the Royal Navy until the early 1990s. Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service, being operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014.

The Hunter saw combat service in a range of conflicts with several operators, including the Suez Crisis, the Aden Emergency, the Sino-Indian War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Rhodesian Bush War, the Second Congo War, the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. Overall, 1,972 Hunters were manufactured by Hawker Aircraft and its successor, Hawker Siddeley, as well as being produced under licence overseas. In British service, the Hunter was replaced in its principal roles by the Lightning, the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.

==Development==

===Origins===

During 1945, the Second World War came to a close and a new postwar Labour government, headed by Clement Attlee, came to power in Britain. The incoming Attlee government&#x27;s initial stance on defence was that no major conflict would occur for at least a decade, and thus there would be no need to develop or to procure any new aircraft until 1957. In accordance with this policy, aside from a small number of exceptions such as what would become the Hawker Sea Hawk for the Royal Navy, the majority of Specifications issued by the Air Ministry for fighter-sized aircraft during the late 1940s were restricted to research purposes. Aviation author Derek Wood describes this policy as being: &quot;a fatal error of judgement which was to cost Britain a complete generation of fighters and heavy bomber aircraft&quot;.

As the Cold War arose in the late 1940s, the RAF came to recognise that it would urgently require the development and procurement of fighters equipped with features such as swept wings. By this time, it had also become apparent that newly developed jet propulsion would form the future of fighter aircraft development. Many companies were quick to devise their own designs to harness this means of propulsion. Hawker Aviation&#x27;s chief designer, Sydney Camm, had proposed the Hawker P.1040 for the RAF, but the demonstrator failed to interest them. Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier-based fighter. However, the Sea Hawk possessed a straight wing and was powered by the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine, both features that rapidly became obsolete.

Seeking better performance and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification E.38/46, Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052, which was essentially a Sea Hawk outfitted with a 35-degree swept wing. Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant further development into a production aircraft. As a private venture, Hawker proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19 June 1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine&#x27;s reheat. In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost in a crash.

===P.1067===
In 1946, the British Air Ministry issued Specification F.43/46, which sought a daytime jet-powered interceptor aircraft. Camm promptly prepared a new design for a swept-winged fighter that would be powered by the upcoming Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet. The Avon&#x27;s major advantage over the earlier Nene engine, as used in the earlier Sea Hawk, was adoption of the axial compressor, which allowed for a much smaller engine diameter and provided greater thrust; this single engine gave roughly the same power as the two Rolls-Royce Derwents of the Gloster Meteors, a fighter aircraft that would be replaced by the envisioned new aircraft. In March 1948, the Air Ministry issued a revised Specification F.3/48, which demanded a speed of 629 mph (1,010 km/h) at 45,000 ft (13,700 m) and a high rate of climb, while carrying an armament of four or two 30 mm (1.18 in) cannon (rather than the large-calibre gun demanded by earlier specifications). Initially fitted with a single air intake in the nose and a T-tail, the project rapidly evolved into the more familiar Hunter shape. The intakes were moved to the wing roots to make room for weapons and radar in the nose, and a more conventional tail arrangement was devised as a result of stability concerns.

In 1950, the outbreak of the Korean War and Britain&#x27;s heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters &#x27;off the drawing board&#x27; in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.

On 20 July 1951, the P.1067 made its maiden flight, flown by Neville Duke, from RAF Boscombe Down, powered by a single 6,500 lbf (28.91 kN) Avon 103 engine. The second prototype, which was fitted with production-standard avionics, armament and a Avon 107 turbojet, first flew on 5 May 1952. As an insurance against development problems on the part of the Avon engine, Hawker modified the design to accommodate another axial turbojet, the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101. Fitted with a Sapphire, the third prototype flew on 30 November 1952.

On 16 March 1953, the first production standard &quot;Hunter F.1&quot;, fitted with a single Avon 113 turbojet, made its first flight. The first 20 aircraft were, in effect, a pre-production series and featured a number of &quot;one-off&quot; modifications such as blown flaps and area ruled fuselage. On 7 September 1953, the sole Hunter Mk 3 (the modified first prototype, &quot;WB 188&quot;) flown by Neville Duke broke the world air speed record for jet-powered aircraft, attaining a speed of over Littlehampton, West Sussex. This world record stood for less than three weeks before being broken on 25 September 1953 by the Hunter&#x27;s early rival, the Supermarine Swift, flown by Michael Lithgow.

==Design==

===Overview===

The Hunter entered service with the Royal Air Force as an interceptor aircraft. It was the first jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF. From the outset it was clear that the type had exceptional performance, being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber. The Hunter also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records. The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time, enabled by features such as its removable gun pack and pressurised fuelling system, and for its easy handling in flight.

The definitive version of the Hunter was the FGA.9, on which the majority of export versions were based. Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British government, the Hunter proved far more successful, and had a lengthy service life with various operators, in part due to its low maintenance requirements and operating costs, while further development of the Swift programme was cancelled in 1955.

As the RAF received newer aircraft capable of supersonic speeds to perform the air interceptor role, many Hunters were modified and re-equipped for undertaking ground-attack and reconnaissance missions instead. Hunters deemed surplus to the RAF&#x27;s requirements were also quickly refurbished for continued service abroad. The Hunter would be procured by a considerable number of foreign nations. In addition to former RAF aircraft, roughly half of the nearly 2,000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers. The Hunter would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years. As late as 1996, hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world.

===Armament and equipment===

The single-seat fighter versions of the Hunter were armed with four ADEN cannon, with 150 rounds of ammunition per gun. The cannon and ammunition boxes were contained in a single pack that could be removed from the aircraft for rapid re-arming and maintenance. Unusually, the barrels of the cannon remained in the aircraft while the pack was removed and changed. In the two-seat version, either a single 30 mm ADEN cannon was carried or, in some export versions, two, with a removable ammunition tank. Later versions of the Hunter were fitted with SNEB pods; these were rocket projectiles in 18-round Matra pods, providing an effective strike capability against ground targets.

The Hunter featured a nose-mounted ranging radar, providing range input to the gyro gunsight for air-to-air gunnery only. Other equipment included pylon-mounted underwing external fuel tanks, a forward-facing gun camera, and large streamlined pods for collecting expended shell cases beneath the gun pack. These were nicknamed &quot;Sabrinas&quot;, after the buxom actress of the time. Several variants were fitted with tail-mounted brake parachutes. Typically, export Hunters were equipped to be compatible with additional types of missiles, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile.

===Layout and structure===
The Hunter is a conventional swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots and has a single jetpipe in the rear of the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter&#x27;s aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.

Late-production F.6s also featured an &quot;all-moving tailplane&quot;, in which the entire tailplane pivoted to provide better transonic flight control. The elevator was retained as part of the all-moving tailplane.

The airframe of the Hunter consists of six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing the cockpit and armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult, as manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.

===Engine===

The P.1067 first flew from RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951, powered by a Rolls-Royce Avon 103 engine from an English Electric Canberra bomber. The second prototype was fitted with a Avon 107 turbojet. Hawker&#x27;s third prototype was powered by an Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101. Production Hunters were fitted with either the Avon or the Sapphire engine.

Early on in the Hunter&#x27;s service the Avon engines proved to have poor surge margins, and worryingly suffered compressor stalls when the cannons were fired, sometimes resulting in flameouts. The practice of &quot;fuel dipping&quot;, reducing fuel flow to the engine when the cannon were fired, was a satisfactory solution. Although the Sapphire did not suffer from the flameout problems of the Avon and had better fuel economy, Sapphire-powered Hunters suffered many engine failures. The RAF elected to persevere with the Avon to simplify supply and maintenance, since the Canberra bomber used the same engine.

The RAF sought more thrust than was available from the Avon 100 series; in response Rolls-Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine. This was an almost wholly new design, equipped with a new compressor to put an end to surge problems, an annular combustion chamber, and an improved fuel control system. The resulting Avon 203 produced of thrust, and was the engine for the Hunter F.6.

==Operational history==

===Royal Air Force===
The Hunter F.1 entered service with the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It was the first high-speed jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter&#x27;s performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A fatal accident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was diverted to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed, killing one pilot.

Another difficulty encountered during the aircraft&#x27;s introduction was the occurrence of surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this defect. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links had a tendency to strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.

To address the problem of range, a production Hunter F.1 was fitted with a modified wing featuring bag-type fuel tanks in the leading edge and two (or 4 on later aircraft) &quot;wet&quot; hardpoints for 100-gallon drop tanks. The resulting Hunter F.4 first flew on 20 October 1954, and entered service in March 1955. A distinctive Hunter feature added on the F.4 was the pair of blisters under the cockpit, which collected spent ammunition links to prevent airframe damage. Crews dubbed them &quot;Sabrinas&quot; after the contemporary movie star. The Sapphire-powered version of the F.4 was designated the Hunter F.5.

The RAF later received Hunters equipped with an improved Avon engine. The Avon 203 produced of thrust and was fitted to &quot;XF833&quot;, which became the first Hunter F.6. Some other revisions on the F.6 included a revised fuel tank layout, the centre fuselage tanks being replaced by new slightly smaller ones in the rear fuselage; the distinctive &quot;dogtooth&quot; leading edge extension (Mod 533) to alleviate the pitch-up problem; the &quot;Mod 228&quot; wing, with increased structural strength and four (rather than the previous two) &quot;wet&quot; hardpoints, finally giving the aircraft a good ferry range. The Hunter F.6 was given the company designation &quot;Hawker P.1099&quot;.

During the Suez Crisis of 1956, Hunter F.5s of No. 1 and No. 34 Squadrons based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus flew escort for English Electric Canberra bombers on offensive missions into Egypt. For most of the conflict the Hunters engaged in local air defence due to their lack of range.

During the Brunei Revolt in 1962, the Royal Air Force deployed Hunters and Gloster Javelins over Brunei to provide support for British ground forces; Hunters launched both dummy and real strafing runs on ground targets to intimidate and pin down rebels. In one event, several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels. Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages in a fierce battle. In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation, Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya.

The Hunter F.6 was retired from its day fighter role in the RAF by 1963, being replaced by the much faster English Electric Lightning interceptor. Many F.6s were then given a new lease of life in the close air support role, converting into the Hunter FGA.9 variant. The FGA.9 saw frontline use from 1960 to 1971, alongside the closely related Hunter FR.10 tactical reconnaissance variant. The Hunters were also used by two RAF display units; the Black Arrows of No. 111 Squadron who set a record by looping and barrel rolling 22 Hunters in formation, and later the Blue Diamonds of No. 92 Squadron who flew 16 Hunters.

In Aden in May 1964, Hunter FGA.9s and FR.10s of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF were used extensively during the Radfan campaign against insurgents attempting to overthrow the Federation of South Arabia. SAS forces would routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision, and, predominantly using 3-inch high explosive rockets and 30 mm ADEN cannon, the Hunter proved an able ground-attack platform. Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967.

Hunters were flown by No.63, No. 234 and No. 79 Squadrons acting in training roles for foreign and Commonwealth students. These remained in service until after the Hawk T.1 entered service in the mid-1970s. Two-seat trainer versions of the Hunter, the T.7 and T.8, remained in use for training and secondary roles by the RAF and Royal Navy until the early 1990s; when the Blackburn Buccaneer retired from service. The requirement for Hunter trainers disappeared so the Buccaneer-orientated trainers were retired, leaving the RN T.8Ms to soldier on for a while longer.

Hunters were also used by the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School at MoD Boscombe Down. The Hunter is unusual among swept wing jet aircraft in being able to be safely spun inverted. This would be demonstrated to students of the school.

=== Royal Danish Air Force ===
As early as 1953 the first Hunter flew over Denmark, when test pilot Neville Duke demonstrated the F.1 over Copenhagen Airport. During this demonstration, the pilot broke the sound barrier in a shallow dive.

Air Force officials were very impressed with the demonstration and since the Royal Danish Air Force (RDAF) were looking for a replacement for the Gloster Meteors in service at the time, the Hunter was a natural choice. Consequently, a contract for delivery of 30 F. Mk. 51 was signed on 3 July 1954. RDAF took delivery of the first two of these on 31 January 1956 and nine months later all 30 Hunters had been delivered to 724 Squadron.

Since the Hunter was a significantly different aircraft to fly, compared to older types such as the Meteor, the need for a two-seat trainer soon arose, and the RDAF took delivery of two T.Mk. 53 two-seat trainers in 1958.

In contrast to most other users of the Hunter, RDAF never converted the Hunter to the fighter-bomber role. Although some studies and experiments carried out in 1959, the project never materialised and the Hunter carried on as a day fighter until its retirement in 1974.

The last flight of the Hunter in RDAF service was carried out on 30 April 1974. The entire fleet was initially preserved at Aalborg Air Base, in the hopes of a future sale to other users. No such sale was ever carried out, but 16 F.Mk. 51s and four T-Mk.53 (two additional T.Mk. 53 had been purchased from the Netherlands in 1967) were sent back to Hawker Siddeley in December 1975. Ultimately, most Hunters were sold either to private buyers or to military museums around the world. Only one example (47-401/E-401) was reserved for museum use in Denmark and currently resides in Danmarks Flymuseum in Stauning.

===Indian Air Force===
In 1954, India arranged to purchase Hunters as a part of a wider arms deal with Britain, ordering 140 Hunter single-seat fighters at the same time that Pakistan announced its purchase of several North American F-86 Sabre jet fighters. The Indian Air Force (IAF) was the first to operate the Hunter T.66 trainers, placing an initial order in 1957. The more powerful engine was considered beneficial in a hot environment, allowing for greater takeoff weights. During the 1960s, Pakistan investigated the possibility of buying as many as 40 English Electric Lightnings, but Britain was unenthusiastic about the potential sales opportunity because of the damage it would do to its relations with India, which at the time was still awaiting the delivery of large numbers of ex-RAF Hunters.

By the outbreak of the Sino-Indian War in 1962, India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia, and the Hunter was the nation&#x27;s primary and most capable interceptor. During the conflict, the Hunter demonstrated its superiority over China&#x27;s Russian-sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air. India&#x27;s aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il-4 bombers from attacking targets within India. In 1962, India had selected to procure its first supersonic-capable fighter, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21; large numbers of Russian-built fighters had increasingly supplemented the ageing Hunters in the interceptor role by 1970.

The Hunter was to play a major role during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; along with the Folland Gnat, the Hunter was India&#x27;s primary air defence fighter, and regularly engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month. Both sides claimed victory in the air war, Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.

IAF Hunters performed extensive operations during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971; India had six combat-ready squadrons of Hunters at the start of the conflict. Pakistani infantry and armoured forces attacked the Indian outpost of Longewala in an event now known as the Battle of Longewala. Six IAF Hunters stationed at Jaisalmer Air Force Base were able to halt the Pakistani advance at Longewala by conducting non-stop bombing raids. The aircraft attacked Pakistani tanks, armoured personnel carriers and gun positions and contributed to the increasingly chaotic battlefield conditions, which ultimately led to the retreat of Pakistan&#x27;s ground forces. Hunters were also used for many ground-attack missions and raids inside Pakistan&#x27;s borders, such as the high-profile bombing of the Attock Oil refinery to limit Pakistani fuel supplies. In the aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan claimed to have shot down a total of 32 of India&#x27;s Hunters.

Due to unfavourable currency conditions and conflicting pressures on the military budget, several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war; the indigenously developed HAL HF-24 Marut had also not been as successful as hoped, thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers. After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter, including the Dassault Mirage F1, the Saab 37 Viggen, and several Soviet models, the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars, a large portion of which were to be assembled domestically, in October 1978. In 1996, the last of the IAF&#x27;s Hunters were phased out of service, the last squadron operating Hunters later converting to the newer Sukhoi Su-30MKI.

===Swedish Air Force===

In the early 1950s, the Swedish Air Force saw the need for an interceptor that could reach enemy bombers at higher altitudes than those attainable by the Saab J 29 Tunnan, which formed the backbone of the fighter force. With the delivery of the supersonic Saab J 35 Draken still a few years away, a contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s (equivalent to the Mk 4) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954 and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955. The model was designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that were tasked with defending Stockholm. The J 34 was armed with four 30 mm (1.18 in) cannon and two Sidewinders. The Swedish Air Force&#x27;s aerobatic team Acro Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s. During the 1960s the J 34s were reassigned to air wings F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in Ängelholm, as F 8 was repurposed and F 18 rearmed with the J 35 Draken. The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969.

A project to improve the performance of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958. While this significantly increased the engine&#x27;s thrust, there was little improvement in overall performance, so the project was shelved.

===Swiss Air Force===
In 1957, the Swiss Air Force performed an extensive evaluation of several aircraft for a prospective purchase; competitors included the North American F-86 Sabre, the Folland Gnat, and the Hawker Hunter; a pair of Hunters were loaned to the Swiss for further trials and testing. In January 1958, the government of Switzerland chose to terminate its independent fighter aircraft project, the in-development FFA P-16, instead choosing to order 100 Hunters to replace its existing fleet of de Havilland Vampire fighters. Further development of the indigenous P-16 was discontinued. This initial order for 100 single-seat Hunters consisted of 12 refurbished RAF F.6s, and 88 new-built F.58s.

Swiss Hunters were operated as interceptors, with a secondary ground-attack role; from 1963 onwards, the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. In the ground-attack role, the Swiss Air Force maintained an arsenal of conventional iron bombs, a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters. In the interceptor role, the Hunters were supplemented by a surface-to-air missile (SAM) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom, based on the Bristol Bloodhound. In case of unserviceable airstrips, Swiss Air Force jets would take off from adjacent highways, using them as improvised runways.

The &quot;Patrouille Suisse&quot; flight demonstration team were prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades. Squadron aircraft were fitted with smoke generators on the engine exhausts and, later on, were painted in a distinctive red-and-white livery. The group officially formed on 22 August 1964, and used the Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994, the team continued to perform flight display using newer aircraft.
The Hunter fleet endured several attempts to procure successor aircraft to the type; in the case of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due to excessive cost overruns and poor project management rather than the attributes of the Hunter itself. A second attempt to replace the Hunter resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A-7 Corsair II. Although the A-7 was eventually chosen as the winner, it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters (22 F.58As and eight T.68 trainers) were purchased in 1974 instead.

By 1975, plans were laid to replace the Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The Hunter remained in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF&#x27;s Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country&#x27;s primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80 mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare dispensers, BL755 cluster bombs and the ability to carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.

In the 1990s, the discovery of wing cracking led to the quick retirement of all Hunter F.58As. The end of the Cold War also allowed Switzerland to retire its Hunters earlier than expected; the Hunter was completely withdrawn from Swiss service in 1994. The Swiss Air Force lost the capability to carry out air-to-ground operations when the Hunters were withdrawn from service.
===Republic of Singapore Air Force===
Singapore was an enthusiastic operator of the Hunter, first ordering the aircraft in 1968 during a massive expansion of the city-state&#x27;s armed forces; deliveries began in 1971 and were completed by 1973. At the time, considerable international controversy was generated as Britain (and, as was later revealed, the U.S.) had refused to sell Hunters to neighbouring Malaysia, sparking fears of a regional arms race and accusations of favouritism. The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) eventually received 46 refurbished Hunters to equip two squadrons.

In the late 1970s, the Singaporean Hunter fleet was upgraded and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore (LASS) with an additional hardpoint under the forward fuselage and another two inboard pylons (wired only for AIM-9 Sidewinders) before the main gears, bringing to a total of seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery. As a result of these upgrades, they were redesignated as FGA.74S, FR.74S and T.75S. The RSAF Black Knights, Singapore Air Force&#x27;s aerobatic team, flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989.

By 1991, Singapore&#x27;s fleet of combat aircraft included the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Northrop F-5 Tiger II, as well as the locally modernised and upgraded ST Aerospace A-4SU Super Skyhawk; the Hunters were active but obsolete in comparison. The type was finally retired and phased out of service in 1992, with the 21 surviving airframes being sold off to an Australian warbird broker, Pacific Hunter Aviation Pty, in 1995.

===Lebanese Air Force===
The Lebanese Air Force operated Hawker Hunters from 1958 to 2014. One Hunter was shot down on the first day of the Six-Day War by the Israeli Air Force. They were used infrequently during the Lebanese Civil War, and eventually fell out of usage and went into storage during the 1980s.

In August 2007, the Lebanese Armed Forces planned to put its Hunters back into service following the 2007 Lebanon conflict, to deal with Fatah al-Islam militants in the Nahr el-Bared camp north of Tripoli. The programme was delayed by lack of spare parts for the aircraft, such as cartridges for the Martin-Baker ejection seats. On 12 November 2008, 50 years after its original introduction, the Lebanese Air Force returned four of its eight Hunters to service with 2nd Squadron, based at Rayak AB: one two-seater and three single-seaters. Military exercises were conducted with Hunters, such as those that took place on 12 July 2010. The Hunters were retired from service during 2014.

===Others===

====Africa====
During the 1950s, the Royal Rhodesian Air Force was an important export customer of Britain, purchasing not only Hunters but also De Havilland Vampires and Canberra bombers. Rhodesia later deployed its Hunter FGA.9s extensively against ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas during the Rhodesian Bush War in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, occasionally engaging in cross-border raids over Zambia and Mozambique. The Zimbabwean Air Force Hunters were flown to support Laurent Kabila&#x27;s loyalists during the Second Congo War, and were reported to be involved in the Mozambican Civil War. One remained in service in 2022. In Somalia, the Siad Barre regime&#x27;s fleet of ageing Hunters, often piloted by former Rhodesian servicemen, carried out several bombing missions against rebel units in the late 1980s.

====Belgium and the Netherlands====

The Belgian Air Force received 112 Hunter F.4s between 1956 and 1957 to replace the Gloster Meteor F.8. The aircraft were built under licence in both Belgium and the Netherlands in a joint programme, some using US offshore funding. SABCA and Avions Fairey built 64 aircraft in Belgium and a further 48 were built in the Netherlands by Fokker. The Hunters were used by Nos. 1, 3 and 9 Wings but did not serve for long; the aircraft with 1 Wing were replaced in 1958 by the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck, and most were scrapped afterwards.

The Belgian and Dutch governments subsequently ordered the improved Hunter F.6, with Nos. 1, 7 and 9 Wings of the Belgian Air Force receiving 112 Fokker-built aircraft between 1957 and 1958. Although built in the Netherlands, 29 aircraft had been assembled from kits in Belgium by SABCA and 59 by Avions Fairey, and were operated by 7 and 9 Wings. No. 9 Wing was disbanded in 1960, and by 1963 the Hunter squadrons in 7 Wing had also been disbanded. A large number of the surviving Hunters were sold to Hawker Aircraft and re-built for re-export to India and Iraq, with others to Chile, Kuwait and Lebanon.

====Middle East====

Between 1964 and 1975, both Britain and France delivered significant quantities of arms, including Hunters, to Iraq. The Hunters were far more effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG-17s then operated by Iraq. In December 1964, a dogfight took place between four Israeli Mirage fighters and four Hunters of the Royal Jordanian Air Force. Two Mirages were downed and another damaged, without damage to the Hunters. In 1967, Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six-Day War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations. During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria. While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3, Flight Lieutenant Saiful Azam, on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force, shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage IIICJ. Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force, but most of the Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground on the first day of the Six-Day War. Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war&#x27;s aftermath. These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis.
====South America====
During the 1960s and 1970s, Chile completed the acquisition of Hunters from Britain for service in the Chilean Air Force. In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker &quot;Napier&quot; ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters in an effort to burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination.

During the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état, some of the Hunters were used by military officers as part of the effort to successfully overthrow the democratically elected president of Chile, Salvador Allende, on 11 September 1973. On 10 September 1973, coup leaders ordered the Hunters to relocate to Talcahuano in preparation. The following morning, the aircraft were used to conduct bombing missions against Palacio de La Moneda, Allende&#x27;s official residence in Santiago, and several radio stations loyal to the government. The UK had signed contracts prior to the Chilean coup d&#x27;état for delivery of a further seven Hunters, as well as performing engine overhauls and the delivery of other equipment. The government under Prime Minister James Callaghan delayed the delivery of the aircraft, along with vessels and submarines also on order; the trade unions took action to block delivery of refurbished Hunter engines at the East Kilbride plant until October 1978. The action was led by Rolls-Royce workers Bob Fulton, Robert Sommerville and John Keenan, who hid the engines in the factory. The government of Chile bestowed on 16 April 2015, its highest civilian medal, the Order Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Medal, on the three workers for their action of solidarity. The protest is the subject of the 2018 documentary film &quot;Nae Pasaran&quot;. In 1982, after the Falklands War, a number of Hunters were air freighted to Chile as part of the arrangements for providing support for UK operations in the South Atlantic.

The purchase of Hunters by Chile may have been a factor in the decision by the Peruvian Air Force to acquire Hunters of its own. Britain was keen to sell to Peru as the decision to sell Hunters to Chile became a controversial political issue for the British government following the Chilean coup; the sale also upheld Britain&#x27;s concept of regional &quot;balancing&quot;.

In August 2021, Lortie was successful as the only bidder to purchase five jets and the spare parts from the Lebanese Air Force, for a price expected to be around US$1m. They were believed to have not been operational since 2010.

;Thunder City
*Three flyable Hunters were based at Thunder City at Cape Town International Airport in South Africa. Four (of the seven) Hunters owned by Thunder City were up for auction in April 2013 

;Hangar 51
*Following the death of Thunder City owner Beachy Head in May 2017, at the end of 2021, Jay Smith, an ex oil entrepreneur with a passion for fast jets and head of South African aircraft maintenance company Hangar 51, bought the remains of the Thunder City collection from Mike Beachy Head&#x27;s estate. At least 2 of the Thunder city Hunters were included, Hunter T.2 ZU-CTN and yellow-painted T.8 ZU-AUJ. Thunder City once owned the world’s largest civil collection of ex-military jets including three English Electric Lightnings, three Blackburn Buccaneers, seven Hawker Hunters, one Aerospatiale Puma (a demonstrator of the company’s upgrade and refurbishment services), a Jet Provost and a Gloster Javelin FAW Mk.1 (RAF No. XA553, mounted as a “Gate Guard” on display at the entrance to the company premises).

==Accidents and incidents==
* 8 February 1956 – Hawker Hunter multiple aircraft accident after a sudden deterioration in the weather during a dogfight exercise in Norfolk, England
* 7 June 1957 – Mid-air collision between two 111 Squadron Hunters during an aerobatic display rehearsal near RAF North Weald, Essex, England. One of the damaged Hunters involved limped as far as Stansted, where it managed to land successfully on the long runway; the other &quot;(XF525&quot;) crashed onto the Epping-Ongar railway at North Weald (the eastern end of the London Underground Central Line, which closed in 1994). The pilot was killed. The track was badly damaged by wreckage and a steam train was derailed. Three of the 20 passengers were slightly injured and the driver, Arthur Green, who operated out of Stratford Depot, was commended for his actions. Wreckage from the jet could be seen in the area for many years afterwards. 
* 5 April 1968 – Alan Pollock, a RAF pilot made an unauthorised flight through Tower Bridge in London in protest against the lack of official recognition of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the RAF
* 22 August 2015 – A Hunter T7 (G-BXFI) crashed onto the A27 arterial road (dual carriageway) between Lancing and Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, England, while taking part in the 2015 Shoreham Airshow. Eleven people on the ground were killed and several others were injured, including the pilot of the plane. Witnesses told local TV that the jet appeared to have crashed when it failed to pull out of a loop manoeuvre. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch concluded that the crash was caused by the pilot completing the top of the loop at too low an altitude and at too low an airspeed. The AAIB concluded that the pilot may have confused the parameters for the Hunter with the BAC Jet Provost he had recently flown, saying, &quot;a possible error path was that the pilot recalled the wrong numbers, essentially mixing up the two aircraft.&quot; The pilot was cleared of criminal charges, though the inquest ruled that the victims had been &quot;unlawfully killed&quot;.

<text>The Ministry of Public Security (MPS, ) is a government ministry of the People&#x27;s Republic of China responsible for public and political security. It oversees more than 1.9 million of the country&#x27;s law enforcement officers and as such the vast majority of the People&#x27;s Police. While the MPS is a nationwide police force, conducting counterintelligence and maintaining the political security of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) remain its core functions.

The ministry was established in 1949 after the CCP&#x27;s victory in the Chinese Civil War as the successor to the Central Social Affairs Department and was known as Ministry of Public Security of the Central People&#x27;s Government until 1954. As the ministry&#x27;s organization was based on Soviet and Eastern Bloc models, it was responsible for all aspects of national security; ranging from regular police work to intelligence, counterintelligence and the suppression of anti-CCP political and social sentiments. Military intelligence affairs remained with the General Staff Department, while the CCP&#x27;s International Department was active in fomenting revolutionary tendencies worldwide by funneling weapons, money and resources into various pro-CCP movements. Most of its counterintelligence responsibilities were taken over by the Ministry of State Security with its creation in 1983.

The ministry employs a system of public security bureaus throughout the provinces, cities, municipalities and townships of China. The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau maintain nominally separate police forces. The ministry is headed by the minister of public security. Wang Xiaohong has been the minister in charge since June 2022.

== History ==
The Ministry of Public Security was among the first government organs established in the PRC. It superseded the Ministry of Public Security of the CCP&#x27;s Central Military Commission (CMC), a transitional body created in July 1949 by removing the security service remit from the CCP&#x27;s Central Social Affairs Department (SAD). The MPS began operations on 1 November 1949, at the end of a two-week-long National Conference of Senior Public Security Cadres. Most of its initial staff of less than 500 cadres came from the (former) regional CCP North China Department of Social Affairs. At the national level, its creation signaled the formal abolition of the SAD. The ministry moved to its present location, in the heart of the one-time foreign legation quarters in Beijing, in the spring of 1950.

The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People&#x27;s Government was formed in 1954. Grand General Luo Ruiqing of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) served as its first minister. As the ministry&#x27;s organization was based on Soviet and Eastern Bloc models, it was responsible for all aspects of national security; ranging from regular police work to intelligence, counterintelligence and the suppression of anti-CCP political and social sentiments. Military intelligence affairs remained with the General Staff Department, while the CCP&#x27;s International Department was active in fomenting revolutionary tendencies worldwide by funneling weapons, money and resources into various pro-CCP movements.

The MPS&#x27;s Guangzhou office historically handled foreign spies such as Larry Wu-tai Chin.

With the creation of the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in July 1983, MPS lost much of its counterintelligence personnel and remit. Scholars Jichang Lulu and Filip Jirouš have argued that the establishment of the MSS &quot;may have contributed to the illusion that the MPS is simply a law-enforcement police body, separate from intelligence agencies.&quot; According to analyst Alex Joske, &quot;the MPS lost much of its foreign intelligence remit after the MSS&#x27;s creation, but has established new units for cross-border clandestine operations since then.&quot; The MPS remains a commonly used cover by MSS officers.

Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, the MPS worked to counter Operation Yellowbird.

The MPS and its officers have been active abroad in Operation Fox Hunt and Operation Sky Net. The MPS under Sun Lijun had reporters from &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in Hong Kong under &quot;full operational surveillance&quot; for their reporting of the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal.

In 2017, Europol signed a &quot;strategic cooperation agreement&quot; with the MPS. Starting in 2019, the MPS began replacing &quot;domestic security&quot; with &quot;political security&quot; in the names of its units. In 2020, the United States Department of Commerce added the MPS Institute of Forensic Science to the Entity List over human rights issues related to the Uyghur genocide. The institute was removed from the list in 2023 as part of an agreement during the APEC United States 2023 to combat fentanyl trafficking.

MPS has at times been involved in security diplomacy between China and other countries. For example, between 1997 and 2020, it organized 11 bilateral police diplomacy meetings with African countries. Under Xi Jinping, MPS has increased its training of police officers from other countries.

In 2022, it was reported that the MPS had established numerous overseas police service stations, which sparked investigations by law enforcement organs in multiple countries. In 2023, the United States Department of Justice stated that the MPS engages in covert &quot;intelligence and national security operations far beyond China&#x27;s borders,&quot; including &quot;illicit, transnational repression schemes&quot;. It charged 34 MPS officers with using fake social media accounts to harass overseas dissidents. The same year, disinformation operations known as Spamouflage or &quot;Dragonbridge&quot; were linked to the MPS. In the run-up to the 2024 United States elections, Spamouflage was identified as having used fake social media accounts in an attempt to amplify divisions in US society.

== Function ==
The Ministry of Public security is the main police agency of China. It manages the vast majority of the People&#x27;s Police. The ministry&#x27;s functions and responsibilities include criminal investigations, managing detention centers, counterterrorism, counternarcotics, transport security, traffic safety, anti-smuggling intelligence gathering and maintaining public security. Additionally, conducting counterintelligence and maintaining the political security of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) remain its core functions. It has the primary authority for preventing cyberattacks and it operates the Golden Shield Project.

== Organization ==
The ministry is headed by the minister of public security. Wang Xiaohong has been the minister in charge since June 2022. The MPS is organized into functional departments (see below). Subordinate to the MPS are the provincial- and municipal-level PSB&#x27;s (Public Security Bureau) and sub-bureaus at the county and urban district levels. At the grassroots level, finally, there are police stations () which serve as the direct point of contact between police and ordinary citizens. While public security considerations have weighed heavily at all levels of administration since the founding of the PRC, the police are perceived by some outside observers to wield progressively greater influence at lower levels of government. Provincial public security bureaus are subject to dual supervision by both local provincial governments and the central government. The ministry is also closely associated with the development of surveillance technologies used by police in China through the Third Research Institute () focused on the development of AI based “smart surveillance,” and censorship technologies.

=== Internal departments ===
The internal departments of the MPS include the General Office, Supervision, Personnel &amp; Training, Public Relations, Economic Crime Investigation, Public Order Administration, Border Control, Criminal Investigation, Exit &amp; Entry Administration, Special Services, Cyber Security, Detention Center Management, Traffic Control, Legal Affairs, International Cooperation, Equipment &amp; Finance, Drug Control, Counter Terrorism, Science &amp; Technology, Information Technology, Political Security, and others.

=== Internal publications ===
The journal &quot;Public Security Construction&quot;（）was a classified serial publication for internal purposes. During the disastrous Great Leap Forward between 1958 and 1961, the circular &quot;Public Security Work Bulletin&quot; () was a top-secret serial which often described China&#x27;s serious food shortages, social unrest and famine directly contradicting Mao Zedong&#x27;s claims of &quot;bountiful economic fruit&quot;.

MPS also produces another journal, &quot;People&#x27;s Public Security News&quot; (), and a website, China Police Daily (), for both internal communication and external publicity.

=== United front organization ===
The MPS&#x27; First Bureau operates a united front organization called the China Association for Friendship.

<text>Joseph Austin Currie (11 October 1939 – 9 November 2021) was an Irish politician who served as a Minister of State with responsibility for Children&#x27;s Rights from 1994 to 1997. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin West constituency from 1989 to 2002, representing Fine Gael, and as a Member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland (MP) for East Tyrone from 1964 to 1972, representing the Nationalist Party and later the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP).

==Early life==
Born in Coalisland, County Tyrone on 11 October 1939, Austin was the eldest of 11 children born to Mary (née O’Donnell) and John Currie. He was educated at the renowned St Patrick&#x27;s Academy, Dungannon, and graduated in politics and history from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. On 20 June 1968, he squatted at a Kinnard Park house given to a Unionist secretary during a housing protest in Caledon. All 14 houses in the new council development had been allocated to Protestants. Then a sitting MP in the home rule Parliament of Northern Ireland, Currie&#x27;s protest was unanimously approved by the Nationalist Party the next day. This was one of the catalysts of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland.

==Political career==
===Northern Ireland===
Currie became an active member in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association. He would later speak about the effect of partition on Catholics in Northern Ireland: &quot;Partition was used to try to cut us off from the rest of the Irish nation. Unionists did their best to stamp out our nationalism and, the educational system, to the extent it could organise it, was oriented to Britain and we were not even allowed to use names such as Séamus or Seán. When my brothers&#x27; godparents went to register their birth, they were told no such names as Séamus or Seán existed in Northern Ireland and were asked for the English equivalent.&quot;

In 1964 he was elected in a by-election as a Nationalist MP for East Tyrone in the 10th House of Commons of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, following the death of the sitting Nationalist MP, Joe Stewart. He retained he seat in both the general election to the 11th House of Commons in November 1965 and the 12th House of Commons in February 1969. This was the last election to the home rule Parliament at Stormort, before it was suspended by the UK Government in March 1972, and formally abolished in July 1973.

====Co-founding the SDLP====
In 1970, he was a founder of the group that established the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). From 1973 to 1974, Currie was elected as an SDLP member of the short-lived devolved Northern Ireland Assembly. In 1974 he became chief whip of the SDLP, and in the same year became Minister for Housing, Local Government and Planning in the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive. The Assembly and Executive collapsed on 28 May 1974, after opposition from within the UUP and the Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike. This led to the imposition of direct rule of Northern Ireland from London.

He contested the 1979 United Kingdom general election and 1986 by-election in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone seat, but was unsuccessful on both attempts. Currie also was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 1982 for the same seat. That Assembly, which was an attempt by the UK Government to reintroduce devolved power-sharing, collapsed in 1986 without executive ministerial functions ever being transferred to it from the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland as no political agreement could be reached on power-sharing between the parties owing to nationalists abstentionism over the constituency boundaries used to elect members, and unionist opposition to the 1985 Anglo Irish Agreement.

===Republic of Ireland=== 
Following his decision to quit Northern Ireland politics, and relocate his family to County Kildare, Currie became actively involved in politics in the Republic. Partly due to his long-standing doubts about the commitment of politicians in the Republic to the plight of northern nationalists, he joined the Fine Gael party in 1989. He was elected as a Fine Gael TD for Dublin West at the 1989 Irish general election.

====1990 Irish presidential election====

In 1990 Fine Gael selected Currie as their candidate for the 1990 Irish presidential election, running against Tánaiste and Fianna Fáil TD, Brian Lenihan Sr, and Senator Mary Robinson for the Labour Party. The 1990 election was the first contested election for the Irish Presidency in 17 years. Currie received 267,902 first preference votes (approximately 17%) and was eliminated on the first count. The distribution of his votes saw Mary Robinson elected as Ireland&#x27;s first female president on the second count, beating Lenihan by more than 86,000 votes.

In his 2004 autobiography &quot;All Hell will Break Loose&quot;, he wrote about his experience of running in the presidential election, and the prejudice he faced as a nationalist from Ulster in southern politics: &quot;What annoyed, indeed angered me most was the suggestion that because I came from the North, I was not a real Irishman ... what I called the partitionist mentality ... [during the election campaign] the [then Fianna Fáil] Minister for Justice Ray Burke] said Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes &#x27;had to go to Tyrone to find a candidate for the presidency&#x27; ... it was hard to take, particularly from so-called republicans&quot;.

====As a TD====
Following his defeat in the presidential election, Austin Currie held his Dáil seat in Dublin West at the 1992 and 1997 general elections. Following the formation of the so-called Rainbow Coalition between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left, on 20 December 1994 newly appointed Taoiseach John Bruton appointed Currie as a Minister of State with responsibility for Children&#x27;s Rights at the Departments of Health, Education and Justice, becoming the first ever minister in an Irish Government with dedicated responsibility for children. He held this post until the appointment of a new Irish Government on 26 June 1997 following the 1997 Irish general election.

At the 2002 general election Currie contested the new constituency of Dublin Mid-West, and failed to be elected. He immediately announced his retirement from electoral politics. He continued to speak and campaign for civil rights across the island of Ireland and for causes he believed in, such as justice for the families of the Disappeared during the Troubles. Currie and his wife and family were personal friends of the family of one of the Disappeared, Columba McVeigh, from Donaghmore, County Tyrone. His daughter Emer Currie was elected in his former constituency of Dublin West at the 2024 Irish general election.

==Personal life==
Austin Currie met his wife Annita in 1961 while he was studying Modern History and Politics at Queens University Belfast, where she was also a student. They were married in January 1968 and had five children, including Emer Currie, who is a Member of the 34th Dáil

In the 1960s and 1970s, he and his family were the repeated targets of loyalist paramilitary attacks on their home in Co Tyrone. When the Troubles broke out in August 1969, Currie was informed by a trusted source that members of the B-Specials intended to carry out a gun attack on his home. In total there were more than thirty attacks on the Currie family home during the Troubles. In November 1972, his wife Anita suffered a brutal attack when two armed and masked men burst into her home looking to attack her husband, who happened to be away at a political speaking engagement in Co Cork that evening. Speaking about it in a TV interview two days later, Anita Currie spoke of how she was punched, cut with a blade, and kicked unconscious while lying on the floor, while her two young daughters looked on helplessly. As a result of these risks, and his growing disillusionment with the political direction the SDLP was taking, Currie quit Northern Ireland politics and relocated his family to the Republic of Ireland.

Speaking in Dáil Éireann on the impact of partition of Ireland upon the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, Currie said in 1999:
Austin Currie resided in County Kildare. He occasionally lectured and gave talks on issues relating to The Troubles, and for causes he believed in, such as justice for the families of the Disappeared during the Troubles.

Following the deaths of Seamus Mallon and John Hume in January and August 2020 respectively, Austin Currie became the last surviving founder of the SDLP.

Austin Currie died on 9 November 2021 at the age of 82 at his residence in Derrymullen, County Kildare. Following an initial funeral mass in Allentown, County Kildare, his remains were transferred to his original family home in Edendork, near Dungannon, County Tyrone, where a second funeral mass was celebrated at St. Malachy&#x27;s Church, Edendork. He is buried alongside his parents in the cemetery adjoining the church.

His brother, Vincent, served as a SDLP member of Dungannon &amp; South Tyrone Borough Council from 1985-2011.

<text>The canton of Schaffhausen, also canton of Schaffhouse (; ; ; ), is the northernmost canton of Switzerland. The principal city and capital of the canton is Schaffhausen. The canton&#x27;s territory is divided into three non-contiguous segments, where German territory reaches the Rhine. The large central part, which includes the capital, in turn separates the German exclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein from the rest of Germany.

== History ==

Schaffhausen was a city-state in the Middle Ages; it is documented that it struck its own coins starting in 1045. It was then documented as &quot;Villa Scafhusun&quot;. Around 1049, Count Eberhard von Nellenburg founded a Benedictine monastery which led to the development of a community. This community achieved independence in 1190. In 1330, the town lost not only all its lands but also its independence to the Habsburgs. In 1415, the Habsburg Duke Frederick IV of Austria sided with the Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, and was banned by the Emperor Sigismund. 

As a result of the ban and Frederick&#x27;s need of money, Schaffhausen was able to buy its independence from the Habsburgs in 1418. The city allied with six of the Swiss confederates in 1454 and allied with a further two (Uri and Unterwalden) in 1479. Schaffhausen became a full member of the Old Swiss Confederation in 1501. 

The first railroad came to Schaffhausen in 1857. In 1944, Schaffhausen suffered from a bombing raid by United States Army Air Forces planes that accidentally strayed from Germany into neutral Switzerland.

The cantonal constitution was written in 1876 and revised in 1895. The distinctive coat of arms bears the &quot;Schaffhauser Bock&quot; (Billy Goat of Schaffhausen).

==Geography==
Schaffhausen is the northernmost canton of Switzerland and lies almost entirely on the right bank of the Rhine, with only part of Stein am Rhein on the left bank. It lies west of Lake Constance and has an area of . Much of the canton is productive agricultural land, with (about 45%) of the canton used for agriculture while an additional (about 43%) is wooded. Most of the rest of the canton, (about 10%), is developed, while only (1.3%) of the canton is unproductive (rivers, lakes or mountains).

The canton&#x27;s territory is divided into three non-contiguous segments where German territory reaches the Rhine. The large central part, which includes the capital Schaffhausen, in turn partially (along with territory of two neighbouring cantons) separates the German exclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein from the rest of Germany. The small exclave of Rüdlingen-Buchberg lies to the southwest, and the third part contains Ramsen and Stein am Rhein to the east. With the exception of Vor der Brugg, part of Stein am Rhein, all three segments are separated from the rest of Switzerland by the Rhine.

The canton of Schaffhausen is bordered by the Swiss cantons of Zürich and Thurgau, as well as the German districts of Waldshut, Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis and Konstanz, Baden-Württemberg.

Most of the canton lies on a plateau dominated by the Hoher Randen. The summit of this mountain is at . The slopes of the mountain are gentle towards the south where it reaches the Rhine valley. Short and narrow valleys intersect these gentle slopes. The Klettgau is one such valley.

<text>Mahadev Haribhai Desai (1 January 1892 – 15 August 1942) was an Indian independence activist, scholar and writer best remembered as Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s personal secretary. He has variously been described as &quot;Gandhi&#x27;s Boswell, a Plato to Gandhi&#x27;s Socrates, as well as an Ānanda to Gandhi&#x27;s Buddha&quot;.

== Early life ==
Mahadev Desai was born in an anavil Brahmin family on 1 January 1892 in the village of Saras in the Surat district of Gujarat to Haribhai Desai, a school teacher, and his wife Jamnabehn. Jamnabehn died when Desai was seven years old. In 1905, aged 13, Mahadev was married to Durgabehn. He was educated at the Surat High School and the Elphinstone College, Mumbai. Desai graduated with a BA Degree, and after earning his L.L.B in 1913 took a job as an inspector at the central co-operative bank in Bombay

== Gandhi&#x27;s associate ==
Mahadev Desai first met Gandhi in 1915 when he went to meet him to seek his advice on how best to publish his book (a Gujrati translation of John Morley&#x27;s English book &quot;On Compromise&quot;). Desai joined Gandhi&#x27;s Ashram in 1917 and with Durgabehn accompanied him to Champaran that year. He maintained a diary from 13 November 1917 to 14 August 1942, the day before his death, chronicling his life with Gandhi. In 1919 when the colonial government arrested Gandhi in Punjab, he named Desai his heir. Desai was for the first time arrested and sentenced to a year in prison in 1921. He was Gandhi&#x27;s personal secretary for 25 years, but as Verrier Elwin wrote of him, &quot;he was much more than that. He was in fact Home and Foreign Secretary combined. He managed everything. He made all the arrangements. He was equally at home in the office, the guest-house and the kitchen. He looked after many guests and must have saved 10 years of Gandhi&#x27;s life by diverting from him unwanted visitors&quot;. Rajmohan Gandhi writes of Mahadev Desai thus: &quot;Waking up before Gandhi in pre-dawn darkness, and going to sleep long after his Master, Desai lived Gandhi&#x27;s day thrice over — first in an attempt to anticipate it, next in spending it alongside Gandhi, and finally in recording it into his diary&quot;.

== Political Activism ==

In 1920, Motilal Nehru requisitioned the services of Mahadev Desai from Gandhi to run his newspaper, the &quot;Independent,&quot; from Allahabad. Desai created a sensation by bringing out a hand-written cyclostyled newspaper after the Independent&#x27;s printing press was confiscated by the British government. Desai was sentenced to a year&#x27;s rigorous imprisonment for his writings in 1921 – his first stint in prison. In prison, Desai saw that the jail authorities mistreated prisoners, frequently flogging them. His report describing life inside an Indian jail, published in &quot;Young India&quot; and &quot;Navajivan&quot;, compelled the British authorities to bring about some drastic jail reform measures. Desai took over as editor of Navajivan in 1924 and from 1925 he began the translation into English of Gandhi&#x27;s autobiography and its serial publication in the Young India. The following year he became chairman of the executive committee of the Satyagraha Ashram and won a prize from the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad for his article in Navajivan. He took part in the Bardoli Satyagraha along with Sardar Patel and wrote a history of the Satyagraha in Gujarati which he translated into English as &quot;The Story of Bardoli&quot;. For his participation in the Salt Satyagraha, he was arrested and imprisoned but following the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, he was released from jail and accompanied Gandhi to the Second round Table Conference along with Mirabehn, Devdas Gandhi and Pyarelal. He was the only person to accompany Gandhi when the latter met with King George V.

Following the collapse of the Gandhi–Irwin Pact and the deadlock at the Round Table Conference, Gandhi restarted the Civil Disobedience Movement. The colonial government, under the new Viceroy, Lord Willingdon, was determined to crush the movement and ordered a clampdown on the Indian National Congress and its activists. In 1932, Desai was arrested again and sent to prison with Gandhi and Sardar Patel. Following his release in 1933, he was re-arrested and detained in the Belgaum Jail. It was during this time in prison that he wrote &quot;Gita According to Gandhi&quot; which was posthumously published in 1946. He also played a role in organising people&#x27;s movements in the princely states of Rajkot and Mysore in 1939 and was put in charge of selecting satyagrahis during the Individual Satyagraha of 1940. Desai&#x27;s final prison term followed the Quit India Declaration of 8 August 1942. He was arrested on the morning of 9 August 1942 and, till his death of a massive heart-attack six days later, was interred with Gandhi at the Aga Khan Palace. Desai was 50 at the time of his death.

== Writings ==
Mahadev Desai was an outstanding writer, at ease with Gujarati, Bengali and English. He is highly regarded as a translator and writer in Gujarati. He wrote several biographies such as &quot;Antyaj Sadhu Nand&quot; (1925), &quot;Sant Francis&quot; (1936), &quot;Vir Vallabhbhai&quot; (1928) and &quot;Be Khudai Khidmatgar&quot; (1936) which was a biography of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and his brother Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan.

He started translating when he was studying in college. He translated John Morley&#x27;s &quot;On Compromise&quot; in Gujarati and won a thousand rupees prize of the Farbas Gujarati Sabha. Later it was published as &quot;Satyagrahni Maryada&quot;. From Bengali, he translated Saratchandra Chattopadhyaya&#x27;s short stories as &quot;Tran Vartao&quot; (1923) and the novella &quot;Virajvahu&quot; (1924). He also translated Tagore&#x27;s works into Gujarati such as &quot;Prachin Sahitya&quot; (1922), &quot;Chitrangada&quot; and &quot;Viday Abhishap&quot; (1925). He translated Nehru&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot; as &quot;Mari Jeevanktha&quot; (1936) into Gujarati from English. The English translation of Gandhi&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Story of My Experiments with Truth&quot;, from its Gujarati original was also done by Desai.

&quot;Mahadevbhaini Dayari&quot; (1948–1997) is the 22 volume publication of Mahadev Desai&#x27;s diaries. These, edited by Narhari Parikh (Volume I-VI) and Chandulal Bhagubhai Dalal (VII-XXII), provide a close look at Gandhi&#x27;s life and are a valuable chronicle of the major events in Gandhi&#x27;s life and in Indian independence movement.

He was also a regular contributor to Gandhi&#x27;s publications &quot;Young India&quot;, &quot;Navjivan&quot; and the &quot;Harijanbandhu&quot;. Desai was among the founding members of the &quot;All India Newspaper Editors&#x27; Conference&quot;. He also frequently contributed to various nationalist Indian newspapers such as &quot;Free Press&quot;, &quot;The Bombay Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, &quot;The Hindu&quot; and &quot;Amrita Bazar Patrika.&quot;

He wrote several works in English including &quot;Gandhiji in Indian Villages&quot; (1927), &quot;With Gandhiji in Ceylon&quot; (1928), &quot;The Story of Bardoli&quot; (1929), &quot;Unworthy of Vardha&quot; (1943), &quot;The Eclipse of Faith&quot; (1943), &quot;A Righteous Struggle&quot; (1951) and &quot;Gospel of Selfless Action or The Geeta According to Gandhi&quot; (1946, translation of &quot;Anasaktiyoga&quot; by Gandhi).

He was posthumously awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1955 for &quot;Mahadevbhaini Dayari&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==

Aged 50, Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack on the morning of 15 August 1942 at the Aga Khan Palace where he was interned with Gandhi. When Desai stopped breathing, Gandhi called out to him in agitation: &quot;Mahadev! Mahadev!&quot; When he was later asked why he had done so, Gandhi answered: &quot;I felt that if Mahadev opened his eyes and looked at me, I would tell him to get up. He had never disobeyed me in his life. I was confident that if had he heard those words, he would have defied even death and got up&quot;. Gandhi himself washed Desai&#x27;s body and he was cremated on the Palace&#x27;s grounds, where his &quot;samadhi&quot; lies today.

The Indian Department of Posts published a commemorative stamp in his honour in 1983. His son Narayan Desai was also a noted Gandhian activist and writer who wrote Mahadev Desai&#x27;s biography &quot;The Fire and the Rose&quot;. The Mahadev Desai Samajseva Mahavidyalaya, Gujarat Vidyapith&#x27;s faculty of social sciences, arts and humanities was named in Mahadev Desai&#x27;s honour.

<doc id="265870" wikidata="Q465342" url="?curid=265870" title="Wifredo Lam">
<text>Wifredo Óscar de la Concepción Lam y Castilla (; December 8, 1902 – September 11, 1982), better known as Wifredo Lam, was a Cuban artist who sought to portray and revive the enduring Afro-Cuban spirit and culture. Inspired by and in contact with some of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, Lam melded his influences and created a unique style, which was ultimately characterized by the prominence of hybrid figures. This distinctive visual style of his also influences many artists. Though he was predominantly a painter, he also worked with sculpture, ceramics and printmaking in his later life.

==Early life==
Wifredo Lam was born and raised in Sagua La Grande, a village in the sugar farming province of Villa Clara, Cuba. He was of mixed-race ancestry: his mother, the former Ana Serafina Castilla, was born to a Congolese former slave mother and a Cuban mulatto father and his father, Yam Lam, was a Chinese immigrant. In Sagua La Grande, Lam was surrounded by many people of African descent; his family, like many others, practiced Catholicism alongside their African traditions. Through his godmother, Matonica Wilson, a Santería priestess locally celebrated as a healer and sorceress, he was exposed to rites of the African orishas. While Lam was never initiated into Santería, Palo Monte, or Abakuá Secret Society, he was familiar with the practices, as cultural participation was widespread in Cuba. His contact with African celebrations and spiritual practices proved to be his largest artistic influence.

In 1916, Lam moved to Havana to study law, a path that his family had thrust upon him. Simultaneously he also began studying tropical plants at the Botanical Gardens. From 1918 to 1923, Lam studied painting at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. However, he disliked both academic teaching and painting. He left for Madrid, Spain, in the autumn of 1923 to further his art studies.

==Career in Europe==
In 1923, Lam began studying in Madrid under Fernando Álvarez de Sotomayor y Zaragoza, the curator of the Museo del Prado and teacher of Salvador Dalí. In the mornings he would attend his conservative teacher&#x27;s studio, while he spent his evenings working alongside young, nonconformist painters. At the Prado, he discovered and was awed by the work of Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel I. While Lam&#x27;s early paintings were in the modernist Spanish tradition, his work soon became more simplified and decorative. Though his dislike for academic conservatism persisted, his time in Spain marked his technical development, in which he began to merge a primitive aesthetic and the traditions of Western composition. It was in Paris that Lam was exposed to conventions of African sculpture. In 1929, he married Eva Piriz, but both she and their young son died in 1931 of tuberculosis; it is likely that this personal tragedy contributed to the dark nature of his work.

During the 1930s, Lam was exposed to a variety of influences. The influence of Surrealism was discernible in his work, as well as that of Henri Matisse. Lam had begun to incorporate Surrealist techniques before his time in Europe, learning of artists like Matisse through publications and news from a friend. Throughout Lam&#x27;s travels through the Spanish countryside, he developed empathy for the Spanish peasants, whose troubles in some ways mirrored those of the former slaves he grew up around in Cuba. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he sided with the Republicans in 1936-1937 and used his talent to fashion Republican posters and propaganda. Drafted to defend Madrid, Lam was incapacitated during the fighting in late 1937 and was sent to Barcelona. There he met Helena Holzer, a German researcher, and the Catalan artist known as Manolo Hugué. Manolo gave Lam the letter of introduction that sparked his friendship with Picasso, whose artwork had impressed and inspired Lam a year before when he saw an exhibition in Madrid.

In 1938, Lam moved to Paris. He quickly gained the support of Picasso, who introduced him to many of the leading artists of the time, such as Fernand Léger, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and Joan Miró. He also befriended the poet Mary Stanley Low. In his trip to Mexico in the same year, Lam stayed with Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.

Picasso also introduced him to Pierre Loeb, a Parisian art dealer; Loeb gave Lam his first exhibition at the Galerie Pierre Loeb in 1939, which received an enthusiastic response from critics. Picasso and Lam also exhibited their work together at the Perls Galleries in New York in the same year. Lam&#x27;s work went from showing the influence of Matisse, seen in his still lifes, landscapes and simplified portraits, to being influenced by Cubism. Mainly working with gouache, Lam began producing stylized figures that appear to be influenced by Picasso. Much of his work in 1938 possessed emotional intensity; the subject matter ranged from interacting couples to women in despair and showed a considerably stronger African influence, seen in the figures&#x27; angular outlines and the synthesis of their bodies.

While Lam began simplifying his forms before he came into contact with Picasso&#x27;s work, it is apparent that Picasso had a significant impact on him. With regard to Picasso&#x27;s exhibition, Lam said that it was &quot;not only a revelation, but… a shock.&quot; Lam gained the approval of Picasso, whose encouragement has been said to have led Lam to search for his own interpretation of modernism.

With the outbreak of World War II and the invasion of Paris by the Germans, Lam left for Marseille, France, in 1940. There he rejoined many intellectuals, including the Surrealists, with whom he had been associated since he met André Breton in 1939. While in Marseille, Lam and Breton collaborated on the publication of Breton&#x27;s poem &quot;Fata Morgana&quot;, which was illustrated by Lam. Though the drawings he created in Marseille between 1940 and 1941 are known as the &quot;Fata Morgana&quot; suite, only about three inspired the illustrations for the poem. In 1941, Breton, Lam and Claude Lévi-Strauss, accompanied by many others, left for Martinique, only to be imprisoned. After forty days, Lam was released and allowed to leave for Cuba, which he reached in midsummer 1941.

==Havana years==

Upon his return to Havana, Lam developed a new awareness of Afro-Cuban traditions. He noticed that the descendants of the slaves were still being oppressed and that the Afro-Cuban culture was degraded and made picturesque for the sake of tourism. He believed that Cuba was in danger of losing its African heritage and therefore sought to free them from cultural subjugation. In an interview with Max-Pol Fouchet, he said:

&quot;I wanted with all my heart to paint the drama of my country, but by thoroughly expressing the negro spirit, the beauty of the plastic art of the blacks. In this way I could act as a Trojan horse that would spew forth hallucinating figures with the power to surprise, to disturb the dreams of the exploiters.&quot;
Additionally, his time in Cuba marked a rapid evolution of his style. Drawing from his study of tropical plants and familiarity with Afro-Cuban culture, his paintings became characterized by the presence of a hybrid figure—part human, part animal, and part vegetal. His style was also distinctive because of its fusion of Surrealist and Cubist approaches with imagery and symbols from Santería. In 1943, he began his best-known work, &quot;The Jungle&quot;. It reflected his mature style, depicting four figures with mask-like heads, half-emerging from dense tropical vegetation. Later that year it was shown in an exhibition at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in New York, where it created controversy. The painting depicted the tension between Modernism and the vibrancy and energy of African culture. &quot;The Jungle&quot; was ultimately purchased by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It is often compared to Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, which is hung in the Museo Reina Sofía in Madrid.

Another work of Picasso&#x27;s that has been compared to &quot;The Jungle&quot; is &quot;Les Demoiselles d&#x27;Avignon&quot;. Although these two paintings were created thirty-six years apart and have different cultural contexts, they both depict women in a sexualized context and both contain primitivist and Cubist elements in their designs.

The combination of African ideas with a European style in Lam&#x27;s work, &quot;The Jungle&quot; led to Lam and his second wife experiencing discrimination from the largely nonwhite Cuban population. Upon his return to Cuba, Lam moved away from the cosmopolitan art community and experimented more with Cuban avant-garde styles. Cuban artists have accused Lam of being an impostor when it comes to his artwork and his identity as a Cuban.
Lam continued to simplify and synthesize abstraction yet continued painting figurally; he also kept on developing the mythology and totemism that defined his style. In 1944, he married Helana Holzer, whom he divorced in 1950. In 1946, he and Breton spent four months in Haiti. There Lam enriched his already extensive understanding and knowledge of African divinity and magic rituals through observing Voodoun ceremonies, although he later said that his contact with the African spirituality that he found throughout the Americas did not directly impact his formal style. African poetry, on the other hand, was said to have had a broadening effect on his paintings. In 1950, he worked with René Portocarrero and others; in the village of Santiago de Las Vegas, the group of painters worked on ceramic. Lam settled in Paris in 1952 after having divided his time between Cuba, New York, and France.
Lam, who continued to sympathize with the common man, exhibited a series of paintings at Havana University in 1955 to demonstrate his support for the students&#x27; protests against Batista&#x27;s dictatorship. Similarly, in 1965, six years after the revolution, he showed his loyalty to Castro and his goals of social and economic equality by painting &quot;El Tercer Mundo&quot; (The Third World) for the presidential palace. In 1960, Lam established a studio in Albissola Marina on Italy&#x27;s northwest coast and settled there with his wife Lou Laurin, a Swedish painter, and their three sons. In 1964, he was awarded the Guggenheim International Award and between 1966 and 1967 there were many retrospectives of his work throughout Europe. At the encouragement of Asger Jorn and after being intrigued by the local pottery-making, Lam began to experiment with ceramics and had his first ceramic exhibition in 1975. He progressed to model sculptures and cast in metal in his twilight years, often depicting personages similar to those he had painted.

Wifredo Lam died on September 11, 1982, in Paris, aged 79. Having had more than one hundred personal exhibitions around the world, Lam had a well established reputation by the time of his death.

==Legacy==
Lam, like many of the most renowned artists of the 20th century, combined radical modern styles with the &quot;primitive&quot; arts of the Americas. While Diego Rivera and Joaquín Torres García drew inspiration from Pre-Columbian art, Lam was influenced by the Afro-Cubans of that time. He dramatically synthesized the Surrealist and Cubist strategies while incorporating the iconography and spirit of Afro-Cuban religion. For that reason, his work does not belong to any particular art movement.

He held the belief that society focused too much on the individual and sought to show humanity as a whole in his artwork. He painted generic figures, creating the universal. To further his goal, he often painted mask-like faces. While Cuban culture and mythology permeated his work, it dealt with the nature of man and therefore was wholly relatable to non-Cubans.

Opened in 1983, the Wifredo Lam Center for Contemporary Art (in Spanish: Centro de Arte Contemporáneo Wifredo Lam) is a state-run gallery in tribute to Lam and located in Havana, Cuba. This art gallery is responsible for the organization of the Bienal de la Habana, Cuba, a permanent art collection of approx. 1000 works, and research and study of contemporary visual arts in developing countries.

In 2015, a retrospective exhibition of his works opened at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, set to travel to the Reina Sofia Museum in Spain and the Tate Museum in London afterwards.

In 2019, his work was included in the group show &quot;The Gift of Art&quot;, at Pérez Art Museum Miami. The exhibition highlighted important artworks within PAMM&#x27;s permanent collection on Latinx and Latin American artists. Among the artists featured in the exhibition were José Bedia (Cuba), Teresa Margolles (Mexico), Roberto Matta (Chile), Oscar Murillo (Colombia), Amelia Peláez (Cuba), Zilia Sánchez (Cuba), Tunga (Brazil), and Carmen Herrera (Cuba).

==&quot;The Jungle&quot;==
&quot;The Jungle&quot;, which is considered Lam&#x27;s masterpiece, is exemplary of the artist&#x27;s mature style. The polymorphism, for which Lam is well known, juxtaposes aspects of humans, animals, and plants, creating monstrous, hybrid creatures. This merging of human, animal, and plant forms is described as magical metamorphosis. Scholars have hypothesized that these figures originated from Lam&#x27;s subconscious, connecting the artwork to Surrealist principles. The dense composition creates a claustrophobic feeling while the forms remain difficult to differentiate. Scholars attribute this abstract construction of figures to the Cubist art style.

=== Elements of the painting ===
The four figures&#x27; elongated limbs lack definition, while much emphasis is placed on body parts, such as their large feet, round buttocks and breasts, and images under two of the figures&#x27; mouths that Adrían claims resemble male genitalia. There are also African-inspired masked heads; scholars report that Lam was interested the carvings on African masks. Additionally, the iridescent quality of the forms enhances the painting&#x27;s tropical feeling. The imagery of the tropics is also suggested with the densely packed cane stalks and palm leaves that merge with the figures, mirroring cosmological concepts from Afro-Cuban religions where deities that inhabit elements in nature. The sugarcane in the painting is suggested to allude to the fields in which African slaves owned by the Spanish and Portuguese worked. The figure on the far right holding the shears is thought to be harvesting the sugarcane and figure on the far left resembles a horse and is suspected to represent a figure from Afro-Cuban mythology. Although the sugarcane provides some potential context to the artwork, there is no specific geographic location where &quot;The Jungle&quot; is supposed to occur. Scholars suggest that this lack of specificity makes orients the artwork towards a more universal audience.

The somber palette containing a mixture of blue, green, yellow, and white suggests a hidden moonlit scene, perhaps a reference to the secret practice of African religions among enslaved peoples. The usage of color in &quot;The Jungle&quot; can also be viewed as occurring during the day in depths of a jungle. Furthermore, historians suggest that the usage of red and orange in the color palette represent blood.

=== Cultural context ===
&quot;The Jungle&quot; was not, however, intended to describe the primitivism of Cuba. Rather, Lam&#x27;s intention was to depict a spiritual state—which is surely inspired by Santería; he sheds light on the absurdity that has become Afro-Cuban culture and more specifically on the way Afro-Cuban traditions were cheapened for tourism. Specifically, Caribbean and Atlantic studies scholar Francisco-J. Hernández Adrián suggests that &quot;The Jungle&quot; serves as a critique of the exoticizing lens placed on the Atlantic as a byproduct of the colonial era. He sought to describe the reality of the Afro-Cuban experience of his time and gained acclaim and fame for doing so. The artwork is suggested to have challenged the colonial viewpoint. Furthermore, Hernández Adrián claims that the imagery of the artwork reflects the constant struggles black people faced in Cuban society. Specifically, one of the central struggles in the artwork is the slave labor suggested by the sugar cane in &quot;The Jungle&quot;. Art historian Doris Maria-Reina Bravo argues that the intensive labor in which many had to participate in Cuba as suggested by the artwork strongly differs from the way tourists viewed Cuba. She claims that during the time of the artwork&#x27;s creation, tourists viewed Cuba as a &quot;playground&quot;.

==Art market==
On December 6, 2017, Sotheby&#x27;s sold Lam&#x27;s &quot;A Trois Centimetres de la Terre&quot; (1962) for €4.44m ($5.24m), which established a new record price for the painter. The work was sold as part of the Alain and Candice Fraiberger collection. The previous record for the artist was set in May 2012, when &quot;Idolo&quot; (&quot;Oya/Divinit de l&#x27;air de la mort&quot;) sold for $4.56m. A new record was established on June 28, 2020, when Sotheby&#x27;s auctioned Lam&#x27;s &quot;Omi Obini&quot; for $9,603,800.

<text>Sikorsky Aircraft is an American aircraft manufacturer based in Stratford, Connecticut. It was established by the Russian-American aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky in 1923, and was among the first companies to manufacture helicopters for civilian and military use. It also produced seaplanes for passenger transport and surface vehicles such as trains and boats.

Sikorsky was owned by United Technologies Corporation until November 2015, when it was sold to Lockheed Martin.

==History==

On March 5, 1923, the Sikorsky Aero Engineering Corporation was founded near Roosevelt Field, New York, by Igor Sikorsky, an immigrant to the United States who was born in Kyiv, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire). In 1925, the company name was changed to Sikorsky Manufacturing Company. After the success of the S-38, the company was reorganized as the Sikorsky Aviation Corporation with capital of $5,000,000, allowing the purchase of land and the building of a modern aircraft factory in Stratford. In 1929, the company moved to Stratford, Connecticut, and it became a part of United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (later United Technologies Corporation or UTC) in July of that year.
In the United States, Igor Sikorsky originally concentrated on the development of multiengine landplanes and then amphibious aircraft. In the late 1930s, sales declined and United Aircraft merged his division with Vought Aircraft. He then began work on developing a practical helicopter. After first flying the VS-300 he developed the Sikorsky R-4, the first stable, single-rotor, fully controllable helicopter to enter full-scale production in 1942, upon which most subsequent helicopters were based.

Sikorsky Aircraft remains a leading helicopter manufacturer, producing such well-known models as the UH-60 Black Hawk and SH-60 Seahawk, and experimental types such as the Sikorsky S-72. Sikorsky has supplied the Presidential helicopter since 1957. Sikorsky&#x27;s VH-3 and VH-60 perform this role now.

The company acquired Helicopter Support Inc. (HSI) in 1998. HSI handles non-U.S. government aftermarket support for parts and repair for the Sikorsky product lines.

UTC acquired Schweizer Aircraft Corp. in 2004, after which it operated as a subsidiary of Sikorsky. The product lines of the two firms were complementary, and had little overlap, as Sikorsky primarily concentrates on medium and large helicopters, while Schweizer produces small helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), gliders, and light planes. The Schweizer deal was signed on August 26, 2004, exactly one week after the death of Paul Schweizer, the company&#x27;s founder and majority owner. In late 2005, Sikorsky completed the purchase of Keystone Helicopter Corporation, located in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Keystone had been maintaining and completing Sikorsky S-76 and S-92 helicopters prior to the sale.
In 2007, Sikorsky opened the Hawk Works, a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center located west of the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in Big Flats, New York. That same year Sikorsky purchased the PZL Mielec plant in Poland. The plant is assembling the S-70i for international customers.

In February 2009, Sikorsky Global Helicopters was created as a business unit of Sikorsky Aircraft to focus on the construction and marketing of commercial helicopters. The business unit combined the main civil helicopters that were produced by Sikorsky Aircraft and the helicopter business of Schweizer Aircraft that Sikorsky had acquired in 2004. It was based at Coatesville, Pennsylvania until 2022.

In 2011, Sikorsky laid off 400 workers at the Hawk Works plant, and later in 2012 the remaining 570 workers and closed all Sikorsky facilities in Chemung County; moving the military completion work to their West Palm Beach, Florida, facility. The commercial products had already been moved to their Coatesville, Pennsylvania facility.

Sikorsky&#x27;s main plant and administrative offices are located in Stratford, Connecticut, as is a large company-owned private heliport . Other Sikorsky facilities are in Trumbull, Shelton, and Bridgeport, Connecticut (with small company heliport ); Fort Worth, Texas; West Palm Beach, Florida; and Huntsville and Troy, Alabama. Sikorsky-owned subsidiaries are in Grand Prairie, Texas, and elsewhere around the world.

In 2023, Sikorsky Aircraft celebrated their 100-year anniversary.

===Acquisition===
In 2015, UTC considered Sikorsky to be less profitable than its other subsidiaries, and analyzed a possible spin-off rather than a tax-heavy sale.

On July 20, 2015, Lockheed Martin announced an agreement to purchase Sikorsky from UTC for $9.0 billion. The deal required review from eight different jurisdictions, and the final approval came in November 2015. The sale was completed on November 6, 2015.

== AHS Sikorsky Prize ==
In 1980, the American Helicopter Society International offered a prize of US$10,000 for the first human-powered helicopter flight (60-second duration, a height of 3 meters, and staying within an area of 10 x 10 m) and soon increased prize money to US$25,000. In 2010, Sikorsky Aircraft pledged to increase the prize sponsorship to US$250,000. Canadian engineers Dr. Todd Reichert and Cameron Robertson developed the world&#x27;s largest human-powered helicopter with a team from the University of Toronto. The first flight of AeroVelo Atlas was achieved in August 2012, the 64-second, 3.3-m-flight that won the prize on June 13, 2013.

==Products==
Sikorsky designates nearly all of its models with S-numbers; numbers S-1 through S-27 were designed by Igor Sikorsky before he left the Russian Empire. Later models, especially helicopters, received multiple designations by the military services using them, often depending on purpose (UH, SH, and MH for instance), even if the physical craft had only minor variations in equipment. In some cases, the aircraft were returned to Sikorsky or to another manufacturer and additionally modified, resulting in still further variants on the same basic model number.

<text>Mary Garden (20 February 1874 – 3 January 1967) was a Scottish-American operatic lyric soprano, then mezzo-soprano with a substantial career in France and America in the first third of the 20th century. She spent the latter part of her childhood and youth in the United States and eventually became an American citizen, although she lived in France for many years and eventually retired to Scotland, where she spent the last 30 years of her life and died.

Described as &quot;the Sarah Bernhardt of opera&quot;, Garden was an exceptional actress as well as a talented singer. She was particularly admired for her nuanced performances which employed interesting uses of vocal color. Possessing a beautiful lyric voice that had a wide vocal range and considerable amount of flexibility, Garden first arose to success in Paris during the first decade of the 20th century. She became the leading soprano at the Opéra-Comique; notably portraying roles in several world premieres, including Mélisande in Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1902). She worked closely with Jules Massenet, in whose operas she excelled. Massenet notably wrote the title role in his opera &quot;Chérubin&quot; (1905) for her.

In 1907, Oscar Hammerstein convinced Garden to join the Manhattan Opera House in New York where she became an immediate success. By 1910 she was a household name in America and Garden appeared in operas in several major American cities; including performing with the Boston Opera Company and the Philadelphia Opera Company. Between 1910 and 1932 Garden worked in several opera houses in Chicago. She first worked with the Chicago Grand Opera Company (1910–1913) and then joined the Chicago Opera Association in 1915, ultimately becoming the company&#x27;s director in 1921. Although director for only one year, Garden was notably responsible for staging the world premiere of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; before the company went bankrupt in 1922. Shortly thereafter she became the director of the Chicago Civic Opera where she commissioned the opera &quot;Camille&quot; by 28-year-old composer Hamilton Forrest. She sang roles at the Civic Opera until 1931, notably in several United States and world premieres.

Additionally, Garden appeared in two silent films made by Samuel Goldwyn.

After retiring from the opera stage in 1934, Garden worked as a talent scout for MGM. She also gave lectures and recitals, mostly on the life and works of Claude Debussy, until 1949. She retired to Scotland and in 1951 published a successful autobiography, &quot;Mary Garden&#x27;s Story&quot;.

Her voice is preserved on a number of recordings made for the Gramophone Company (including some with Debussy at the piano), Edison Records, Pathé, Columbia Records and the Victor Talking Machine Company between 1903 and 1929.

==Biography==

=== Early life and rise to stardom in Europe===

====Early years====

Mary Garden was born on 20 February 1874 at 35 Charlotte Street, Aberdeen, Scotland, the oldest of the four daughters of Robert Davidson Garden (&quot;b&quot;. 1851), a cashier at the Blaikie ironworks, and his wife Mary (&quot;née&quot; Joss) (1852–1948). Her parents married a little over a month before her birth. Two of her sisters were born in Scotland while another was born in the United States.

The family moved to Chicopee, Massachusetts, United States when she was nine years old. They then moved to Hartford, Connecticut a few years later, and then to Chicago in 1888 when Mary was 14.

==== Voice student ====
She showed promise as a young singer, and studied with Sarah Robinson-Duff in Chicago under the financial support of wealthy patrons David and Florence Mayer. In 1896 she pursued further studies in Paris, chiefly with Ange-Pierre de Trabadelo and Lucien Fugère, still under the support of the Mayers. She also studied some under Jacques Bouhy, Jules Chevalier, and Mathilde Marchesi. In 1899 Garden lost the backing of her benefactors, and she began to study singing with the American soprano Sibyl Sanderson. Sanderson introduced her to Jules Massenet and Albert Carré, the director of the Opéra-Comique.

==== Operatic debut ====
Impressed with her voice, Carré invited her to join the roster at the Opéra-Comique in 1900. Garden made her professional opera debut with the company on 10 April 1900 in the title role of Gustave Charpentier&#x27;s &quot;Louise&quot;, which had received its world premiere only two months before. Although Garden had been preparing the role, her debut, at the eighth performance of the work, was unscheduled as she was a last minute replacement for Marthe Rioton who had become ill. From 1901 for two years, she carried on an affair with André Messager, who conducted her in &quot;Louise&quot;. She claimed that when the Opéra-Comique director Albert Carré asked her to marry him, she replied that she had someone else in her life – Messager. Her description is of a tempestuous relationship, but they remained friends until his death.
After her debut, Garden quickly became one of the leading sopranos at the Opéra-Comique. In 1901 she starred in two world premieres, Marie in Lucien Lambert&#x27;s &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and Diane in Gabriel Pierné&#x27;s &quot;La fille de Tabarin&quot;. That same year she sang the title role in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Thaïs&quot; at Aix-les-Bains, and sang both the title roles in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot; and Messager&#x27;s &quot;Madame Chrysanthème&quot; at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo; all under the coaching of Sanderson. In 1902, Claude Debussy selected her to play the female lead at the Opéra-Comique debut of his &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. Garden&#x27;s performances met with considerable critical acclaim. She also created a sensation as &quot;Salomé&quot; in the French version of Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera of that name.

Following the success of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, Garden periodically went to London to sing at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden while still appearing in performances in Paris. At Covent Garden she sang Manon, Juliette in Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, and Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; during the 1902 and 1903 seasons. Garden, however, did not care for London and decided to not take any more engagements in that city. Her performances at the Opéra-Comique during this time included the title role in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Grisélidis&quot; (1902), Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; (1903), the title role in the world premiere of Xavier Leroux&#x27;s &quot;La reine Fiammette&quot; (1903), and the title role in Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Hélène&quot; (1905). In 1905 she sang at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo in the world premiere of Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Chérubin&quot;, a role which the composer wrote specifically for her. The following year she returned to the Opéra-Comique to sing Chrysis in the world premiere of Camille Erlanger&#x27;s &quot;Aphrodite&quot;.

===Departure from the Opéra-Comique and later career in the United States===

Persuaded by Oscar Hammerstein to join his competition against the Metropolitan Opera, Garden quit her frequent Opéra-Comique engagements to join the Manhattan Opera House in New York City. She made her American debut in the Manhattan Opera House on 25 November 1907 in the title role in &quot;Thaïs&quot;, a role which fitted her personality and art like a glove. She further astounded American audiences with her uncanny portrayal of a young boy in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Le jongleur de Notre-Dame&quot; (1908) and in the United States premiere of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;.

In 1908 she returned to Paris to join the roster at the Opéra National de Paris. She sang there for one season, notably portraying Ophelia in Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1908) and the title part in Henry Février&#x27;s &quot;Monna Vanna&quot; (1909) among other roles. She also sang the role of Marguerite in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (1909) in Brussels. Afterwards, Garden returned again to New York in 1909 to perform the title role in the French version of Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Salome&quot;. During the performance she lasciviously kissed the severed head of John the Baptist which shocked the morals of a number of the audience members even more than her Dance of the Seven Veils (which she performed in a bodystocking).

By 1910, Garden had become a household name within America. She left the Manhattan Opera House to join the Chicago Grand Opera Company where she sang from 1910 to 1913 in such roles as Mélisande, Fanny in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Sapho&quot;, Dulcinée in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;, the Prince in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Cendrillon&quot;, the title role in Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, and the title role in Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;. During this time she also sang in other American cities, notably appearing in the world premiere of Victor Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Natoma&quot; in Philadelphia on 25 February 1911 and in the title role Février&#x27;s &quot;Monna Vanna&quot; in its United States premiere in Boston. In late April 1912 Garden along with Caruso and the Metropolitan Opera Company gave special concerts in which they raised $12,000(over quarter of a million in 2017) dollars for aid to survivors of the &quot;Titanic&quot; tragedy.
Garden next sang with the Chicago Opera Association from 1915 until 1921 where she sang such roles as the title part in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; and the title part in the world premiere of Février&#x27;s &quot;Gismonda&quot; (both 1919), and the role of Fiora in Montemezzi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;amore dei tre re&quot; (1920) among many others. She notably became the director of the Chicago Opera Association in a notorious coup for the organization&#x27;s final 1921–22 season. She was also an early proponent of radio, and entered into an agreement with Chicago radio station KYW to broadcast that season&#x27;s grand opera performances, the first time this had been done.
Although serving as director for only one year, she was responsible for producing the world première of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;. Also during this time she appeared in two silent films made by Samuel Goldwyn, the title role in a film version of &quot;Thais&quot; (1917) and the role of Dolores Fargis in &quot;The Splendid Sinner&quot; (1918). During World War I she was decorated by the French and Serbian governments and made a Chevalier (knight) of the Légion d&#x27;Honneur in 1921.

In 1922 Garden became the director of the newly formed Chicago Civic Opera where she also performed roles until 1931. Among the many roles she performed with the Chicago Civic Opera are Charlotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot; (1924), Katyusha in Franco Alfano&#x27;s &quot;Risurrezione&quot; (1925, in French) and the heroine of Arthur Honegger&#x27;s &quot;Judith&quot; (1927), the last two both United States premières. In 1930 she sang in the world premiere of Hamilton Forrest&#x27;s &quot;Camille&quot;, an opera based on Dumas″ &quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;. That same year she returned to the Opéra-Comique to appear in several operas. In 1931 Garden sang her last role with the Chicago Civic Opera, &quot;Carmen&quot;, after which the company went bankrupt.
Garden retired from the opera stage in 1934, after making her last appearance as Katyusha in Franco Alfano&#x27;s &quot;Risurrezione&quot; at the Opéra-Comique. After retiring, Garden worked as a talent scout for MGM and gave lectures and recitals, mostly on the life and works of Claude Debussy up through 1949. For much of her life she had openly encouraged young singers and even secretly paid for them to receive training. She continued to support young artists after her retirement through master classes, often allowing aspiring artists to attend for free. She also had her own voice studio in Chicago where one of her pupils was soprano and philanthropist Jean Tennyson. Tennyson later used her great wealth to provide scholarships for young singers to study the French repertoire with Garden; including soprano Beverly Sills. Garden and Tennyson remained lifelong friends, and Garden dedicated her autobiography &quot;To Jean Tennyson in loving appreciation of our long and loyal friendship.&quot;

===Personal life===

As portrayed in both her autobiography and Michael Turnbull&#x27;s biography, Garden was an archetypal diva who knew exactly how to get her own way. She had a number of feuds with various colleagues from which she invariably emerged victorious, eventually ending up in control of the Chicago Opera. A relentless self-publicist, a woman however of genuine beauty, her flamboyant personal life was often the subject of more attention than her public performances, and her affairs with men, real or imagined, were liable to emerge as scandalous rumours in the newspapers.
Her autobiography, &quot;Mary Garden&#x27;s Story&quot; (1951), is marred by inaccuracies. Always prone to embellish and exaggerate, Garden was already succumbing to dementia when the manuscript was being prepared.

It was in recognition of her personal history that Scottish Opera chose to present in their inaugural 1962 season &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;. That year marked the centenary of Debussy&#x27;s birth and the diamond jubilee of the opera. By the time of the first performance Mary Garden was unable to accept her invitation to attend, being in hospital after a fall, and with her health in decline.

Mary Garden died in Inverurie, close to Aberdeen, where she spent the last 30 years of her life. An award for opera singing at the Aberdeen International Youth Festival is made in her name. There is a small memorial garden dedicated to her in the west-end of Aberdeen, with a small inscribed stone and a bench.

==Recordings and films==
Mary Garden made about 40 gramophone records between 1903 and 1929 for G &amp; T, Columbia and Victor. They continue to be reissued and are of interest to connoisseurs of historical recordings—although Garden herself was said to have been generally disappointed with the results. Of special interest are the four 1904 Black G&amp;T recordings she made accompanied by Claude Debussy in Paris. There are also a small number of recordings made from radio broadcasts.

She made two silent films, &quot;Thais&quot; (1917) and a World War I romance entitled &quot;The Splendid Sinner&quot; (1918). Without her singing voice, her acting was criticized and neither film was a success. In the 1930s, Garden appeared on Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot;. One such airing had Garden and Melvyn Douglas reading the play &quot;Tonight or Never&quot; by ) which had recently been made into a motion picture.

==Literary references==
Garden is cited with other artistic figures of the period in Hugh MacDiarmid&#x27;s poem &quot;A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle&quot; (ll.30–2):
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Whaur&#x27;s Isadora Duncan dancin nou,
Is Mary Garden in Chicago still
And Duncan Grant in Paris – and me fou?&lt;/poem&gt;

Allen Ginsberg contrasts the relative silence surrounding Garden&#x27;s death with the uproar caused by the death of Jack Ruby in &quot;Bayonne Turnpike to Tuscarora,&quot; from the 1973 award-winning collection &quot;The Fall of America&quot;:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
Mary Garden dead in Aberdeen,
 Jack Ruby dead in Dallas - 
 Sweet green incense in car cabin
New Years&#x27; 1967 come,
 Reynolds Metals up a Half
 Mary Garden, 92, sleeping tonite in Aberdeen
&lt;/poem&gt;
Garden and Ruby both died on 3 January 1967.

<doc id="265883" wikidata="Q240933" url="?curid=265883" title="Joan Rivers">
<text>Joan Alexandra Molinsky (June 8, 1933 – September 4, 2014), known professionally as Joan Rivers, was an American comedian, actress, producer, writer, and television host. She was noted for her blunt, often controversial comedic persona that was heavily self-deprecating and acerbic, especially towards celebrities and politicians, delivered in her signature New York accent. She is considered a pioneer of women in comedy. She received an Emmy Award and a Grammy Award, as well as nomination for a Tony Award.

Rivers started her career in comedy clubs in Greenwich Village alongside her peers George Carlin, Woody Allen, and Richard Pryor. She then rose to prominence in 1965 as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Hosted by her mentor, Johnny Carson, the show established Rivers&#x27;s comedic style. In 1986, with her own rival program, &quot;The Late Show with Joan Rivers&quot;, Rivers became the first woman to host a late night network television talk show. She subsequently hosted &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot; (1989–1993), winning a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host. From the mid-1990s, she became known for her comedic red carpet awards show celebrity interviews. Rivers co-hosted the E! celebrity fashion show &quot;Fashion Police&quot; from 2010 to 2014 and starred in the reality series &quot;Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best?&quot; (2011–2014) with daughter Melissa Rivers.

In addition to marketing a line of jewelry and apparel on the QVC shopping channel, Rivers authored 12 best-selling books and three LP comedy albums under her own name: &quot;Mr. Phyllis and Other Funny Stories&quot; (Warner Bros 1965), &quot;The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album&quot; (Buddah 1969), and &quot;What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?&quot; (Geffen 1983). She was nominated in 1984 for a Grammy Award for her album &quot;What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?&quot; and was nominated in 1994 for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance of the title role in &quot;Sally Marr ... and Her Escorts&quot;. In 2009, Rivers competed alongside her daughter Melissa on the second season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice&quot;, ultimately winning the season. In 2015, Rivers posthumously received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for her book, &quot;Diary of a Mad Diva&quot;.

In 1968, &quot;The New York Times&quot; television critic Jack Gould called Rivers &quot;quite possibly the most intuitively funny woman alive&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked her sixth on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time, and in October the same year, she was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. She is the subject of the documentary &quot;Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work&quot; (2010).

== Early life ==
Joan Alexandra Molinsky was born on June 8, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, to Russian Jewish immigrants Beatrice (née Grushman) and Meyer C. Molinsky, a doctor. She had an elder sister named Barbara Waxler. Rivers spent her early life in Prospect Heights and Crown Heights in Brooklyn. At the age of eight, she created her first alter ego, &quot;J. Sondra Meredith&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;thetimes.co.uk/zv6sgvrvpkr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture School, a progressive and now-defunct school, and Adelphi Academy of Brooklyn, a college preparatory day school, where she was co-chair of her school, due to her past experiences in theatrical activities. Within two years, she performed in the School Cavalcades, and in 1949, aged 16, she was vice president of the Dramatic Club. She graduated from the Adelphi Academy of Brooklyn, in 1951, at 18. In her adolescence, Rivers relocated with her family to Larchmont, north of New York City.

Rivers matriculated at Connecticut College; it was a family legacy to attend the institution, as her sister had done. Rivers has stated in interviews that she was overweight throughout her childhood, adolescence and in college,&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorker/2015/last-girl-larchmont&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and that it had a profound impact on her body image, which she struggled with throughout her life. After two years, she transferred to Barnard College, where she graduated in 1954 with a B.A. in English literature and anthropology.

Rivers repeatedly said, and it was reported in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, that she graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa; however, biographers James Spada and Leslie Bennetts found that these were fabrications, as with other statements such as sharing a lesbian kiss in a play with Barbra Streisand (they did both appear in a play named &quot;Driftwood&quot;, but were never on stage at the same time).

Before entering show business, Rivers worked at various jobs such as a tour guide at Rockefeller Center, a writer/proofreader at an advertising agency and a fashion consultant at Bond Clothing Stores. During this period, agent Tony Rivers advised her to change her name, so she chose Joan Rivers as her stage name. She stated that he stopped sending her to audition because of this.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvAcademyINTERVIEWS/Rivers/1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== 1950s–1960s ===

During the late 1950s, Rivers appeared in a short off-Broadway play called &quot;Driftwood&quot; alongside Barbra Streisand. According to an interview with &quot;Adweek&quot;, the play ran for six weeks at the playwright Maurice Tei Dunn&#x27;s apartment on 49th Street in New York. In the early 1960s, Rivers performed at various comedy clubs in Greenwich Village, including The Bitter End, The Gaslight Cafe and The Duplex. It was during this period that she befriended fellow comedians Woody Allen and George Carlin, often sharing meals with them. Rivers also had the opportunity to work alongside renowned musicians Bob Dylan, Barbra Streisand, Carly Simon, and Simon &amp; Garfunkel in the Village.

Between 1963 and 1964, Rivers joined forces with Jim Connell and Jake Holmes in the cabaret act &quot;Jim, Jake &amp; Joan&quot;. Their appearance at The Bitter End in 1964 led to their inclusion in the motion picture &quot;Once Upon A Coffee House&quot;, marking Rivers&#x27; first credit in a feature film. However, the group disbanded soon after. Holmes later recalled an incident that led to their separation: &quot;We were supposed to perform at a rally for Bobby Kennedy, who was running for New York senator in 1964. Joan showed up wearing a [Republican Senate nominee Kenneth] Keating button, and Jim told her to remove it. She refused, staunchly sticking to her political beliefs, and Jim said, &#x27;Who needs you, anyway?&#x27; That was the end of Jim, Jake &amp; Joan...&quot;

Rivers also made a guest appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, hosted by Jack Paar, which originated in New York. In 1965, she worked as a gag writer and participant on &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, where she played the role of &quot;the bait&quot; to lure people into humorous situations for the show. After seven auditions over three years, she finally made her first appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with its new host, Johnny Carson, on February 17, 1965. Rivers considered this episode to be her breakthrough, as Carson famously told her, &quot;you&#x27;re gonna be a star.&quot; She became a frequent guest on the show and developed a close friendship with Carson.

Her profile skyrocketed in the following years, and she began to make frequent guest appearances on popular shows like &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, and &quot;Girl Talk&quot; with Virginia Graham. She even wrote material for the puppet mouse Topo Gigio. In addition, she had a small role in the cult drama film &quot;The Swimmer&quot; (1968), alongside Burt Lancaster. Around the same time, she hosted a short-lived syndicated daytime talk show called &quot;That Show with Joan Rivers&quot;, which premiered on September 16, 1968. Each episode had a unique theme, and Rivers opened with a monologue related to that day&#x27;s topic, then hosted celebrity interviews. The show also featured an expert on the subject and a celebrity guest. Early episodes featured prominent figures such as Johnny Carson, Jerry Lewis, Joel Grey, Don Rickles, and Godfrey Cambridge. During the mid-1960s, she released at least two comedy albums: &quot;The Next to Last Joan Rivers Album&quot; and &quot;Rivers Presents Mr. Phyllis &amp; Other Funny Stories&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
By the 1970s, Rivers continued to be a prominent fixture on television. Along with her other guest-spots on the late-night circuit, she also made appearances on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, had a semi-regular stint on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and guest-starred on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;. Rivers made her Broadway debut in the play &quot;Fun City,&quot; which opened on January 2, 1972, and co-starred Gabriel Dell, Rose Marie and Paul Ford. It ran for only nine performances amid a negative critical reception. Though a &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer criticized the production as &quot;frenetic to the point of being frazzled,&quot; he praised Rivers as &quot;a deft comedy writer&quot; and &quot;a very funny lady&quot;. From 1972 to 1976, she narrated &quot;The Adventures of Letterman&quot;, an animated segment for &quot;The Electric Company&quot;.

In 1973, Rivers co-wrote the made-for-television movie &quot;The Girl Most Likely To...&quot;, a black comedy starring Stockard Channing as an ugly girl who becomes beautiful after undergoing plastic surgery, and takes revenge on people who previously mistreated her. The film, based on Rivers&#x27; story, became a ratings success and has been considered a &quot;cult classic&quot;. She also wrote a thrice-weekly column for &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; from 1973 to 1976, and published her first book, &quot;Having a Baby Can Be a Scream&quot;, in 1974; she described it as a &quot;catalogue of gynaecological anxieties&quot;. In 1978, Rivers made her directorial debut&lt;ref name=&quot;tvAcademyINTERVIEWS/Rivers/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the comedy &quot;Rabbit Test&quot;, which she also wrote and which starred her friend Billy Crystal in his film debut as the world&#x27;s first pregnant man. The film earned 12 million dollars at the box office. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded: &quot;Miss Rivers has turned to directing without paying much heed to whether a whole movie constructed from one-liners is worth even the sum of its parts.&quot; During the same decade, she was the opening act for singers Helen Reddy, Robert Goulet, Paul Anka, Mac Davis, and Sergio Franchi on the Las Vegas Strip.

=== 1980s ===
During the early and mid-1980s, Rivers found further success in stand-up and television, though the decade subsequently proved to be controversial for her. The year 1983, in particular, was very successful; she performed at Carnegie Hall in February, did the March stand-up special &quot;An Audience with Joan Rivers&quot;, hosted the April 9 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and released the best-selling comedy album &quot;What Becomes a Semi-Legend Most?&quot;, which reached No. 22 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. By August 1983, Carson established Rivers as his first permanent guest host on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. At the time, she spoke of her primary &quot;Tonight Show&quot; life as having been &quot;Johnny Carson&#x27;s daughter&quot;, a reference to his longtime mentoring of her.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Rivers served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute. A friend of Nancy Reagan, Rivers attended a state dinner in 1983, and later performed at a luncheon at the 1984 Republican National Convention. In 1984, Rivers published a best-selling humor book, &quot;The Life and Hard Times of Heidi Abramowitz&quot;, a mock memoir of her brassy, loose comedy character, which was mostly jokes about promiscuity – of a type that would have been considered unacceptable even in burlesque a generation earlier. A television special based on the character, a mock tribute called &quot;Joan Rivers and Friends Salute Heidi Abramowitz: Tramp of the Century&quot;, later aired on Showtime. She later wrote her next book, &quot;Enter Talking&quot;, which was released in 1986, and described her rise to stardom and the evolution of her comedic persona.
In 1986, the move came that ended Rivers&#x27; longtime friendship with Johnny Carson. The soon-to-launch Fox Television Network announced that it was giving her a late night talk show, &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;, making Rivers the first woman to have her own late-night talk show on a major network. The new network planned to broadcast the show 11 p.m. to midnight Eastern Time, making her a Carson competitor. Carson learned of the show from Fox and not from Rivers. In the documentary &quot;Johnny Carson: King of Late Night&quot;, Rivers said that she only called Carson to discuss the matter after learning that he may have already heard about it and that he immediately hung up on her. &quot;And he never spoke to me again. He took it as a complete betrayal,&quot; said Joan. In the same interview, she said that she later came to believe that maybe she should have asked for his blessing before taking the job. Rivers was banned from ever appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for the rest of Carson&#x27;s tenure and the entire runs of Carson&#x27;s first two successors Jay Leno and Conan O&#x27;Brien out of respect for Carson. Rivers did not appear on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; again until February 17, 2014, at the age of 80, when she made a brief appearance on new host Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s first episode. On March 27, 2014, Rivers returned to the show for an interview.

&quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot; premiered on October 9, 1986, but Rivers&#x27; tenure was short-lived. When Rivers challenged Fox executives, who wanted to fire her husband Edgar Rosenberg as the show&#x27;s producer, the network fired them both on May 15, 1987.

On August 14, 1987, Rosenberg committed suicide in Philadelphia; Rivers blamed the tragedy on his &quot;humiliation&quot; by Fox. Shortly after Rosenberg&#x27;s suicide the magazine GQ published what was purported to be an interview with Rivers, written by &quot;Bert Hacker&quot;. The piece quoted Rivers saying terrible things about her dead spouse. One quote was &quot;Listen, when I think of the way he makes me crazy, I really wonder if they didn&#x27;t execute the wrong Rosenbergs.&quot; In fact, Bert Hacker was a pseudonym used by former Nixon speechwriter and sometime comic Ben Stein, who had never met Rivers and simply made up the entire account. Rivers sued Stein for libel and won an undisclosed amount which was distributed to charities she designated. Rivers credited Nancy Reagan with helping her after her husband&#x27;s suicide.

During the airing of her late-night show, Rivers made the voice-over role of Dot Matrix in the science-fiction comedy &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987), a parody based (mainly) on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The film, directed and co-starring Mel Brooks, was a critical and commercial success, later becoming a &quot;cult classic&quot;. After the Fox controversy, her career went into hiatus. Rivers subsequently appeared on various television shows, including the &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse Christmas Special&quot; in December 1989. She also appeared as one of the center square occupants on the 1986–89 version of &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;, hosted by John Davidson. On September 5, 1989, &quot;The Joan Rivers Show,&quot; her daytime television program, premiered in broadcast syndication. The show, which ran for five seasons, was a success and earned Rivers the Daytime Emmy in 1990 for Outstanding Talk Show Host. &quot;Entertainment Weekly,&quot; in a September 1990 article, asserted: &quot;&quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot; is a better showcase for her funny edginess than her doomed 1988 Fox nighttime program was. The best thing about her daytime talker is that Rivers&#x27; stream-of-consciousness chattiness is allowed to guide the show — you never know where the conversation is going to go.&quot;

=== 1990s ===
In addition to winning the Emmy for &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot;, Rivers starred in the made-for-television comedy How to Murder a Millionaire, which premiered in May 1990 on CBS. In the film, co-starring Alex Rocco and Telma Hopkins, she took on the role of a Beverly Hills matron possessed with the idea her husband is trying to kill her. Also in 1990, she started to design jewelry, clothing and beauty products for the shopping channel QVC. On this professional endeavor, Rivers said: &quot;In those days, only dead celebrities went on [QVC]. My career was over. I had bills to pay. ... It also intrigued me at the beginning&quot;. The sales of Rivers&#x27; products exceeded $1 billion by 2014, making her one of the network&#x27;s top sellers. In 1991, she wrote her next book, &quot;Still Talking&quot;, which described the cancellation of her late-night show and her husband&#x27;s suicide. Until 1993, she received five additional Emmy nominations for her daytime talk-show &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot; — two for Outstanding Writing – Special Class and three for Outstanding Talk Show Host.

In 1994, Rivers and daughter Melissa first hosted the E! Entertainment Television pre-awards show for the Golden Globe Awards and, beginning in 1995, E!&#x27;s annual Academy Awards pre-awards show as well. Rivers and her daughter quickly became credited for revolutionizing the red carpet as a space to showcase designers&#x27; work and celebrity interactions. &quot;Joan and Melissa were the first people who came out and made it more of a true conversation between star and reporter&quot;, E!&#x27;s Senior Vice President of production, Gary Snegaroff, remarked to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. &quot;They asked about what [actresses] were wearing because that&#x27;s what the magazines would cover after the fact, and turned it into a candid conversation on the carpet where anything could happen&quot;. Rivers and Melissa, at the time, both portrayed themselves in the made-for-television drama &quot;Tears and Laughter: The Joan and Melissa Rivers Story&quot;, which chronicled the aftermath of Rosenberg&#x27;s suicide. It aired on NBC on May 15, 1994. The next year, she wrote her book &quot;Jewelry by Joan Rivers&quot;.

Influenced by the stand-up comedy of Lenny Bruce, Rivers co-wrote and starred in a play about Bruce&#x27;s mother Sally Marr, who was also a comic and influenced her son&#x27;s development as a comic. After 27 previews, &quot;Sally Marr ... and Her Escorts,&quot; a play &quot;suggested by the life of Sally Marr&quot; ran on Broadway for 50 performances in May and June 1994. The production received mixed reviews, but her performance was applauded by critics. &quot;The Chicago Sun Times&quot; found Rivers to be &quot;compelling&quot; as an actress while &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;... [S]he is exuberant, fearless and inexhaustible. If you admire performers for taking risks, then you can&#x27;t help but applaud her efforts&quot;. Rivers was nominated for a Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Actress in a Play and a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for playing Marr. Beginning in March 1997, Rivers hosted her own radio show on WOR in New York City for several years, and wrote three self-help books: &quot;Bouncing Back: I&#x27;ve Survived Everything ... and I Mean Everything ... and You Can Too!&quot; in 1997, &quot;From Mother to Daughter: Thoughts and Advice on Life, Love and Marriage&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Count the Candles: Just Keep the Fire Lit!&quot;, in 1999.

=== 2000s ===

Rivers was a guest speaker at the opening of the American Operating Room Nurses&#x27; San Francisco Conference in 2000, and by the first part of the decade, she continued to host the awards&#x27; red carpet for the E! channel. Between 2002 and 2004, she embarked on tour with her one-person comedy show &quot;Joan Rivers: Broke and Alone&quot;, which was presented in the United Kingdom (Edinburgh and London) and in the United States (Los Angeles, and Boston), to generally positive reviews. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; felt that her &quot;hilarious assaults on fellow celebrities and tirades about the perils of ageing and plastic surgery are well worth the expense&quot;, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; remarked that &quot;Rivers returned triumphant, a victorious heavyweight after a great fight, conscious that she is still the champion&quot;.

In 2003, Rivers left the network red-carpet show for a three-year contract (valued at $6–8 million) to cover award shows&#x27; red carpet events for the TV Guide Channel. Meanwhile, Rivers guest-starred as herself in several television series, including &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, and &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, and also voiced herself for a brief scene in the 2004 animated fantasy film &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. In 2004, Rivers was part of the formal receiving party when Ronald Reagan was placed in state at the United States Capitol. On December 3, 2007, Rivers performed at the 79th Royal Variety Show at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, England, with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip present. She wrote and starred in the play &quot;Joan Rivers: A Work in Progress by a Life in Progress&quot;, which was directed by Sean Foley, and presented through 2008 at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Leicester Square Theatre, to a mixed critical reception.

In 2008, Rivers was invited to take part in a comedy event celebrating Prince Charles&#x27; 60th Birthday titled, &quot;We Are Most Amused&quot;. She was the only American alongside Robin Williams invited to take part in the event. Other comedians included John Cleese, who served as the master of ceremonies, Eric Idle, Rowan Atkinson, and Bill Bailey. Those in attendance included Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry.

Throughout the decade, Rivers often appeared in various television game shows, including &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot;, &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot;, and &quot;Celebrity Family Feud&quot;, in which she competed with her daughter against Ice-T and Coco. In 2009, Rivers and daughter Melissa were contestants on season eight of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. During the season, each celebrity raised money for a charity of his or her choice; Rivers selected God&#x27;s Love We Deliver. After a falling out with poker player Annie Duke, following Melissa&#x27;s on-air firing (elimination) by Donald Trump, Rivers left the green room telling Clint Black and Jesse James that she would not be in the next morning. Rivers later returned to the show and on May 3, 2009, she became a finalist in the series. The other finalist was Duke. On the season finale, which aired live on May 10, Rivers was announced the winner and hired to be the 2009 Celebrity Apprentice.

Also in 2009, Rivers was a special &quot;pink-carpet&quot; presenter for the broadcast of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade, was roasted in a Comedy Central special, and her reality show, &quot;How&#x27;d You Get So Rich?&quot;, premiered on TV Land. The program, which ran for two seasons, followed Rivers traveling around the United States interviewing self-made millionaires. She also wrote two books in 2009: &quot;Murder at the Academy Awards (R): A Red Carpet Murder Mystery&quot; and &quot;Men Are Stupid ... And They Like Big Boobs: A Woman&#x27;s Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery (with Valerie Frankel)&quot;.

=== 2010s ===

A documentary film about Rivers, &quot;Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work&quot;, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2010.
The film follows Rivers for 14 months, mostly during the 76th year of her life, and made an effort to &quot;[peel] away the mask&quot; and expose the &quot;struggles, sacrifices and joy of living life as a ground breaking female performer&quot;. The film was released in a limited release on June 11, 2010, and was acclaimed by critics for providing &quot;an honest, behind-the-scenes look at [Rivers]&#x27; career — and at show business in general&quot;. Beginning on September 10, 2010, Rivers co-hosted the E! show &quot;Fashion Police&quot;, along with Giuliana Rancic, Kelly Osbourne, and George Kotsiopoulos, commenting on celebrity fashion. The show started as a half-hour program but due to its success with viewers, it was expanded to one hour on March 9, 2012. The August 26, 2014 episode of &quot;Fashion Police&quot;, about the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards and the 2014 MTV Movie Awards, was her last television appearance before her death.

In 2011, Rivers appeared in a commercial for Go Daddy, which debuted during the broadcast of Super Bowl XLV, and was featured as herself in the season two episode of Louis C.K.&#x27;s self-titled show &quot;Louie&quot; entitled &quot;Joan&quot;, where she performed on stage and gave C.K. comedy advice. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Nathan Rabin described the episode as a &quot;funny and deeply moving exploration of the existential dilemma of the stand-up comic and a valentine to the artform.&quot; Also in 2011, Rivers and her daughter starred in the reality show &quot;Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best?&quot;, which premiered on WE tv. The series follows her moving in with her daughter to California to be closer to her family. The show ran for four seasons until 2014. On the December 4, 2011 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Ten-Per-Cent Solution&quot;, Rivers took on the role of Annie Dubinsky, an agent trying to revive Krusty&#x27;s career. Hayden Childs of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised the choice of having Rivers guest star since she was able to &quot;employ her trademark humor within the world of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; without hijacking the plot or satire&quot;. In 2012, she guest-starred in two episodes of two series: &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot; and &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;.

Rivers released her 11th book &quot;I Hate Everyone...Starting with Me&quot; on June 5, 2012. It received generally positive reviews and made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for several weeks. &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that there were &quot;more punch lines per paragraph than any book I&#x27;ve read in years&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;Rivers is equally passionate and opinionated on every subject she discusses. Hilarious and undeniably original&quot;. On August 7, 2012, Rivers showed up in Burbank, California to protest that the warehouse club Costco would not sell the book. She handcuffed herself to a shopping cart and shouted through a megaphone. The police were called to the scene and she left without incident; no arrests were made. On March 5, 2013, she launched the online talk show &quot;In Bed with Joan&quot; on YouTube. In it, Rivers invited a different guest to talk to her in bed about different things including their past, their love life and their career.

Rivers released her 12th book, &quot;Diary of a Mad Diva&quot;, on July 1, 2014, which also made &quot;The NY Times&quot; Best Seller list. For the book, she posthumously won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2015. Before her death, she filmed a part, along with other female comedians, for the documentary &quot;Makers: Women in Comedy&quot;, which premiered on PBS in October 2014.

== Comedic style ==
During her 55-year career as a comedian, her tough-talking style of satirical humor was both praised and criticized as truthful, yet too personal, too gossipy, and very often abrasive. Nonetheless, with her ability to &quot;tell it like it is&quot;, she became a pioneer of contemporary stand-up comedy. Commenting about her style, she told biographer Gerald Nachman, &quot;Maybe I started it. We&#x27;re a very gossipy culture. All we want to know now is private lives.&quot; However, her style of humor, which often relied on making jokes about her own life and satirizing the lives of celebrities and public figures, was sometimes criticized as insensitive. Her jokes about Elizabeth Taylor and Adele&#x27;s weight, for instance, were often commented on, although Rivers would never apologize for her humor.

Rivers, who was Jewish, was also criticized for making jokes about the Holocaust and later explained, &quot;This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor&quot;, adding, &quot;my husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust.&quot; Her joke about the victims of the Ariel Castro kidnappings similarly came under criticism, but she again refused to apologize, stating, &quot;I know what those girls went through. It was a little stupid joke.&quot; She received multiple death threats throughout her career. Rivers accepted such criticism as the price of using social satire as a form of humor: &quot;I&#x27;ve learned to have absolutely no regrets about any jokes I&#x27;ve ever done ... You can tune me out, you can click me off, it&#x27;s OK. I am not going to bow to political correctness. But you do have to learn, if you want to be a satirist, you can&#x27;t be part of the party.&quot;

As an unknown stand-up comedian out of college, she struggled for many years before finding her comic style. She did stints in the Catskills and found that she disliked the older style of comedy at the time, such as Phyllis Diller&#x27;s, who she nevertheless felt was a pioneer female comedian. Her breakthrough came at The Second City in Chicago in 1961, where she was dubbed &quot;the best girl since Elaine May&quot;, who also got her start there. But May became her and fellow comedian Treva Silverman&#x27;s role model, as Rivers saw her as &quot;an assertive woman with a marvelous, fast mind and, at the same time, pretty and feminine&quot;. It was also there that she learned &quot;self reliance&quot;, she said, &quot;that I didn&#x27;t have to talk down in my humor&quot; and could still earn an income by making intelligent people laugh. &quot;I was really born as a comedian at Second City. I owe it my career.&quot;
In early 1965, at the suggestion of comedian Bill Cosby, Johnny Carson gave Rivers, whom he billed as a comedy writer, her debut appearance on his show. Cosby, who knew Rivers from their early stand-up days, described her as &quot;an intelligent girl without being a weirdo...a human being, not a kook.&quot; Sitting alongside Johnny after her monologue, she displayed an intimate, conversational style which he appreciated, and she was invited back eight more times that year. &quot;Time&quot; magazine compared her humor to that of Woody Allen, by expressing &quot;how to be neurotic about practically everything&quot;, but noting that &quot;her style and femininity make her something special.&quot; Rivers also compared herself to Allen, stating: &quot;He was a writer, which I basically was...and talking about things that affected our generation that nobody else talked about.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Charles L. Mee likewise compared her to Allen, explaining that her &quot;style was personal, an autobiographical stream-of-consciousness&quot;.

According to biographer Victoria Price, Rivers&#x27; humor was notable for taking aim at and overturning what had been considered acceptable female behavior. She broke through long-standing taboos in humor, which paved the way for other women, including Roseanne Barr, Ellen DeGeneres and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. Rivers became closely associated with her catchphrase: &quot;Can we talk?&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Rivers was one of only four Americans invited to the Wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles on April 9, 2005. Rivers was licensed to carry a gun in New York City. She was threatened with the loss of the license after an altercation with a car rental clerk in 2002. She was a registered Republican.

=== Relationships and family ===
Rivers&#x27; first marriage was in 1956 to James Sanger, the son of a Bond Clothing Stores merchandise manager. The marriage lasted six months and was annulled on the basis that Sanger did not want children and had not informed Rivers before the wedding.

Rivers married Edgar Rosenberg on July 15, 1965. Their only child, Melissa Rivers, was born on January 20, 1968. Joan Rivers had one grandson, Cooper, born Edgar Cooper Endicott in 2000. Along with his mother and grandmother, Cooper was featured in the WE tv series &quot;Joan &amp; Melissa: Joan Knows Best?&quot; Rivers was married to Rosenberg until his suicide in 1987, four days after she asked him for a separation. 

In a 2012 interview with Howard Stern, Rivers said she had several extramarital affairs when married to Rosenberg, including a one-night stand with actor Robert Mitchum in the 1960s and an affair with actor Gabriel Dell. In the 1990s, she was in an eight-year relationship with the commissioner of the New York State Office of Parks and Recreation, disabled World War II veteran Orin Lehman of the Lehman family.

In her book &quot;Bouncing Back&quot;, Rivers described how she developed bulimia nervosa after Rosenberg&#x27;s 1987 suicide, and the subsequent death of her psychologist, with whom she had developed a close friendship, of an AIDS related illness. Additionally, Rivers&#x27; relationship with her daughter had been strained at the time, as Melissa blamed her for her father&#x27;s death. According to Rivers, the confluence of events resulted in her contemplating suicide in her California home. &quot;I got the gun out, the whole thing,&quot; she recalled in a 2008 interview. &quot;And [then] my dog came and sat in my lap...and that was a big turning point in my life. My little, stupid dog, a Yorkie, who I adored, literally came and sat on my lap. ...and literally, he saved my life. Truly saved my life.&quot; Rivers eventually recovered with counseling and the support of her family.

In a 2002 ITV biography, Rivers reveals that she is the great niece (on her mother&#x27;s side) of singer Happy Fanny Fields. She says that, &quot;(Fanny) was the star of the family; she came over to the United States and married very, very rich and became very grand. But, she was the one person Noël Coward wanted to meet when he hit the United States.&quot;

=== Philanthropy ===
As a philanthropist, Rivers supported causes which included HIV/AIDS activism, and in May 1985, she appeared along with Nichols and May at a Comic Relief benefit for the new AIDS Medical Foundation in New York City, where tickets at the Shubert Theatre sold for as much as $500. She supported the Elton John AIDS Foundation and God&#x27;s Love We Deliver, which delivers meals to HIV/AIDS patients in New York City. In 2008, she was commended by the City of San Diego, California for her philanthropic work on behalf of HIV/AIDS, where the HIV/AIDS community called her its &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;.

Additionally, she served as an Honorary Director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. She also supported Guide Dogs for the Blind, a non-profit organization which provides guide dogs to blind people. She donated to Jewish charities, animal welfare efforts, and suicide prevention causes. Among the other non-profit organizations which she helped were Rosie&#x27;s Theater Kids, Habitat for Humanity, Human Rights Campaign and the Boy Scouts of America.

=== Cosmetic procedures ===
Rivers was open about her multiple cosmetic surgeries and had been a patient of plastic surgeon Steven Hoefflin since 1983. She had her nose thinned while still at college; her next procedure, an eye lift, was performed in 1965 (when she was in her 30s) as an attempt to further her career. When promoting her book, &quot;Men Are Stupid...And They Like Big Boobs: A Woman&#x27;s Guide to Beauty Through Plastic Surgery&quot;, described by &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; as &quot;a detailed and mostly serious guide to eye lifts, tummy tucks and other forms of plastic surgery&quot;, she quipped: &quot;I&#x27;ve had so much plastic surgery, when I die they will donate my body to Tupperware.&quot;

== Death ==
On August 28, 2014, Rivers experienced serious complications and stopped breathing while undergoing what was scheduled to be a minor throat procedure at an outpatient clinic in Yorkville, Manhattan. Resuscitated an hour later, Rivers was transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital in East Harlem and later put on life support. She died on September 4 at Mount Sinai, never having awakened from a medically induced coma. The New York City Medical Examiner&#x27;s Office said that she died from brain damage caused by a lack of oxygen.

After nearly two months of investigations, federal officials said on November 10 that the clinic made a number of mistakes both before and during the procedure. Among those were the clinic&#x27;s failure to respond to Rivers&#x27; deteriorating vital signs, including a severe drop in her blood pressure, possibly administering an incorrect anesthetic dosage, performing a surgical procedure without her consent, and other medical-clinic irregularities.

On September 7, after the cremation of Rivers&#x27; body at Garden State Crematory in North Bergen, New Jersey, a private memorial service took place at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan. The service was attended by an estimated 1,500 people. The guest list included Rivers&#x27; many celebrity friends and public figures such as Howard Stern, Louis C.K., Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Joy Behar, Michael Kors, Matthew Broderick, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Bernadette Peters, Kathy Griffin, and Donald Trump. The musical performances included Hugh Jackman singing &quot;Quiet Please, There&#x27;s a Lady On Stage&quot;, as well as the New York City Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus singing show tunes. Talk show host Howard Stern, who delivered the eulogy, described Rivers as &quot;brassy in public [and] classy in private ... a troublemaker, trail blazer, pioneer for comics everywhere, ... [who] fought the stereotypes that women can&#x27;t be funny.&quot; Daughter Melissa read a comedic note to her mother as part of her eulogy. Some of Rivers&#x27; ashes were scattered by her daughter in Wyoming.

On January 26, 2015, Melissa Rivers filed a malpractice lawsuit against the clinic and the doctors who performed surgery on her mother. The suit was settled for an undisclosed amount in May 2016, with the doctors accepting responsibility for Rivers&#x27; death.

===Reactions and tributes===

Upon Rivers&#x27; death, friends, fans, family and celebrities paid tribute. Numerous comedians recognized Rivers&#x27; influence on their career, including Kathy Griffin, who considered Rivers her &quot;mentor&quot;, noting, &quot;She brought a fearlessness and a brand of humor into our homes that we really need.&quot; Chris Rock said &quot;she was the hippest comedian from the time she started to the day she died&quot;. Describing her as a force in comedy, he added, &quot;No man ever said, &#x27;Yeah, I want to go on after Joan.&#x27; No, Joan Rivers closed the show every night.&quot; Other comedians recalled working with her on stage and television decades earlier: stand-up performer Don Rickles said &quot;working with her and enjoying the fun times of life with her was special&quot;. Carol Burnett called Rivers &quot;the poster child for the Energizer Bunny&quot;.

Numerous talk show hosts, including David Muir, Graham Norton, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Oprah Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael, Wendy Williams, Geraldo Rivera, Regis Philbin, Arsenio Hall, Ellen DeGeneres, and David Letterman, paid tribute to Rivers, often including video clips of her appearances. Letterman called her a &quot;real pioneer for other women looking for careers in stand-up comedy. And talk about guts.&quot; Conan O&#x27;Brien discussed Rivers&#x27; legacy with fellow comedian and lifelong friend Chris Hardwick on &quot;Conan&quot;, while Seth Meyers recalled Rivers&#x27; appearance on his talk show, saying, &quot;I have not sat next to anyone who told more jokes faster than Joan Rivers did when she was here.&quot; On &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, host Jon Stewart noted her contributions to comedy: &quot;There are very few people in my business that you can say are, or were, actually groundbreaking talents. Joan Rivers was one of them.&quot; 

Radio host Howard Stern, who delivered the eulogy at her funeral, devoted an entire one-hour show to Rivers. Stern sought help from comedian Louis C.K., another friend of Rivers&#x27;, before giving the eulogy. When Stern spoke at the funeral, he began the eulogy with, &quot;Joan Rivers had a dry vagina&quot;, a joke that was intended, and reportedly received by guests, as a humorous honoring of Rivers&#x27; comedic sensibility. Sarah Silverman paid tribute to Rivers while hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; in one sketch, she portrayed Rivers in Heaven. Long-time friend, comedian, fellow talk show hostess and television personality Whoopi Goldberg tweeted: &quot;My friend Joan Rivers has passed away&quot;. She said: &quot;Once again to quote Billy Crystal...There are no words.&quot; Comedian Louis C.K. released a statement saying, &quot;I looked up to her. I learned from her. I loved her. I liked her. And I already miss her very much. It really fucking sucks that she had to die all of a sudden.&quot;
Amy Schumer, speaking at the 2014 &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine &quot;Woman of the Year Awards&quot; ceremony in Carnegie Hall, paid tribute to Rivers, calling her the bravest female comedian.

Political figures giving tribute to Rivers included former First Lady Nancy Reagan, who said she was one of the &quot;funniest people I ever knew&quot;. Upon hearing of her death, Charles, Prince of Wales and his wife Camilla said she was &quot;utterly irreplaceable&quot;. Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu noted that besides bringing laughter to millions of people around the world, she was &quot;proud of her Jewish heritage&quot;. Donald Trump attended her funeral and tweeted that she &quot;was an amazing woman and a great friend&quot;. After her mother&#x27;s death, Melissa Rivers said she received a letter from President Barack Obama in which he wrote, despite being a frequent target of Rivers&#x27; jokes: &quot;not only did she make us laugh, she made us think&quot;.

In a subsequent interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Melissa Rivers cited Courtney Love&#x27;s public tribute to her mother as her favorite, adding: &quot;I loved seeing that outpouring from these women, especially the ones who took the heat on &quot;Fashion Police&quot;, because it meant they got it. It meant they loved her. It meant they saw the humor.&quot;

== Influences ==
===Rivers&#x27; influences===
Joan Rivers was strongly influenced by Lenny Bruce. As a female comic, Rivers felt indebted to, but also very distinct from, other female standups and comedians including Phyllis Diller (a close friend and companion), Fanny Brice, Sophie Tucker, Pearl Williams, Belle Barth, Totie Fields, Jean Carroll, Minnie Pearl, Jackie &quot;Moms&quot; Mabley, Johnny Carson, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Bob Newhart, Woody Allen, Don Rickles, Imogene Coca, Elaine May, Carol Burnett, and Gracie Allen. Rivers&#x27;s early comedy in particular was influenced by vaudeville, Borscht Belt, and proto-feminist comedy of the early-1900s.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Rivers was in a comedy circuit with Lenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Richard Pryor, George Carlin, and Dick Cavett. Though she counted them as peers and friends, she never felt included due to sexist practices within the industry.

===Comedians influenced by Rivers===
Mainstream comedians and contemporaries who have claimed that Rivers was an influence on them include: Kathy Griffin, Sarah Silverman, Margaret Cho, Whitney Cummings, Chris Hardwick, Joy Behar, Amy Schumer, Whoopi Goldberg, Chelsea Handler, Louis C.K., Roseanne Barr, Greg Proops and David Letterman. She is considered a pioneer of women in comedy by many critics and journalists.

<doc id="265885" wikidata="Q7723256" url="?curid=265885" title="The Clandestine Marriage">
<text>The Clandestine Marriage is a comedy by George Colman the Elder and David Garrick, first performed in 1766 at Drury Lane. It is both a comedy of manners and a comedy of errors. The idea came from a series of pictures by William Hogarth entitled &quot;Marriage à-la-mode&quot;.

==Plot summary==
The plot concerns a merchant, Mr Sterling, who wants to marry off his elder daughter to Sir John Melvil, who is actually in love with her younger sister, Fanny. Fanny, however, is in love with a humble clerk, Lovewell, whom she has secretly married. Her attempts to extricate herself from the arrangement with Melvil lead to her becoming the proposed bride of Melvil&#x27;s elderly uncle, Lord Ogleby. When the truth comes out, Fanny and Lovewell are forgiven.

==Performances==
===Play and painting===
On 12 October 1769 the play was performed as a Royal Command Performance with Sophia Baddeley, Robert Baddeley and Thomas King appearing. These three were recorded acting in an oil painting by Johan Zoffany.

===Opera===
The play was adapted into an opéra comique &quot;Sophie, ou le Mariage caché&quot; by Josef Kohaut, which was first staged by Comédie-Italienne in Hôtel de Bourgogne on 4 June 1768.

In 1792, the play was made into another opera: Il matrimonio segreto by Domenico Cimarosa.

===Film===

In 1999, the play was made into a film directed by Christopher Miles and starred Nigel Hawthorne, Joan Collins, Timothy Spall, Emma Chambers and Tom Hollander. The screenplay was written by Trevor Bentham.

<doc id="265890" wikidata="Q6218368" url="?curid=265890" title="John Aislabie">
<text>John Aislabie or Aslabie (; 4 December 167018 June 1742), of Studley Royal, near Ripon, Yorkshire, was a British politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons from 1695 to 1721. He was of an independent mind, and did not stick regularly to the main parties. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the South Sea Bubble and his involvement with the Company led to his resignation and disgrace.
==Background and education==
Aislabie&#x27;s family were originally Yeoman farmers who lived in Hemingbrough. His father George Aislabie married into the highly influential Mallory family through Mary Mallory, daughter of Sir John Mallory of Studley Royal. He was educated at St Peter&#x27;s School, York under the headship of Mr Thomlinson and admitted at St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1687 and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1692. He inherited the Studley estate from his mother&#x27;s family in 1693, and started serious development of the garden around 1716. He was the first in England to introduce natural landscaping and created the water garden at Studley Royal. His son, William Aislabie, added the ruins of Fountains Abbey to the estate.

==Political career==
Aislabie was elected as a member of parliament for Ripon at the 1695 English general election, apparently on the assumption he was a Tory, though his political views were somewhat fluid. He voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696. He was returned again for Ripon at the 1698 English general election. The loss of his wife and daughter in a house fire in January 1700 may have dampened his political activity for a while. He was returned again for Ripon at the two general elections of 1701, and he kept well enough in with Robert Harley to be classed as a Tory. He was elected Mayor of Ripon for the year 1702 to 1703, and was returned instead as MP for Northallerton at the 1702 English general election in an exchange deal with William Hustler. As mayor he was generous in paying for the reconstruction of the Market Cross, and making gifts to the corporation. He became more active in politics from 1704, especially on the economy. At the 1705 English general election, he was returned again for Ripon and voted for the Court candidate as speaker on 25 October 1705. He eventually became associated with the Country Whigs. Under the patronage of Robert Harley he was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty from 1710 in the Tory administration. This proved a precarious appointment as Aislabie&#x27;s Whig sympathies manifested in votes against the government.
When the Whigs returned to office in 1714, Aislabie was made Treasurer of the Navy. He became an ally of the Earl of Sunderland who became, in effect, Prime Minister in 1718. Sunderland appointed Aislabie as Chancellor of the Exchequer. When in 1719 the South Sea Company proposed a deal whereby it would take over the national debt in exchange for government bonds, Aislabie was a very strong supporter of the scheme and negotiated the contract; he piloted the Bill through the House of Commons. The South Sea Company had been built on high expectations which it could never fulfil, and it collapsed in August 1720. An investigation by Parliament found that Aislabie had been given £20,000 of company stock in exchange for his promotion of the scheme. He resigned the Exchequer in January 1721, and in March was found guilty by the Commons of the &quot;most notorious, dangerous and infamous corruption&quot;. He was expelled from the House, removed from the Privy Council, and imprisoned in the Tower of London.

==Later life and contributions==
After his release from prison, he retired to his estate and continued the development of the gardens.

The Ripon Obelisk in the Market Square, Ripon, the first in England, was provided by John Aislabie in 1702, and is now grade I listed.

In 1723, Aislabie constructed Waverley Abbey House on the site of former Cistercian Waverley Abbey in Surrey.

John&#x27;s son William Aislabie would also serve in Parliament for the Ripon constituency.

<doc id="265891" wikidata="Q304366" url="?curid=265891" title="The Great Race">
<text>The Great Race is a 1965 American Technicolor epic slapstick comedy film directed by Blake Edwards, starring Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Natalie Wood, written by Arthur A. Ross (from a story by Edwards and Ross), and with music by Henry Mancini and cinematography by Russell Harlan. The supporting cast includes Peter Falk, Keenan Wynn, Arthur O&#x27;Connell and Vivian Vance. 

The movie cost US$12 million (equivalent to $98.36 million in 2020), making it the most expensive comedy film at the time. The story was inspired by the actual 1908 New York to Paris Race. It was co-produced by Lemmon&#x27;s Jalem Productions, Curtis&#x27; Reynard Productions, and Edwards&#x27; Patricia Productions. 

It is known for one scene that was promoted as &quot;the greatest pie fight ever&quot;. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects.

==Plot==
The Great Leslie and Professor Fate are competing daredevils at the turn of the 20th century. Leslie is the classic hero archetype – always dressed in white, ever-courteous, talented and successful. Leslie&#x27;s nemesis, Fate, is the traditional villain – usually dressed in black, sporting a black moustache and top hat, glowering at almost everyone, possessing a maniacal laugh, filled with plans to thwart the hero, and dogged by failure. Leslie proposes an automobile race from New York City to Paris and offers the Webber Motor Car Company the opportunity to build an automobile to make the journey. They design and build a new car for him, &quot;The Leslie Special&quot;. Fate builds his own car, &quot;The Hannibal Twin-8&quot;, complete with hidden devices of sabotage. Other car owners enter the race, including one owned by New York&#x27;s most prominent newspaper. Driving the newspaper&#x27;s car is photojournalist Maggie DuBois, a vocal suffragist.

A seven-car race begins, but Fate&#x27;s sidekick Maximilian Meen has sabotaged four other cars (and his own, by mistake), leaving just three cars in the race. The surviving teams are Leslie with his loyal valet Hezekiah Sturdy, Maggie DuBois driving a Stanley Steamer by herself, and Fate and Max. The steamer car breaks down and Maggie accepts a lift in the Leslie Special. Fate arrives first at a refueling point, the small Western frontier town of Boracho. &quot;Texas Jack&quot;, a local outlaw, becomes jealous of the attraction to Leslie shown by showgirl Lily Olay and a saloon brawl ensues. Fate sneaks outside amidst the chaos, steals the fuel he needs, and destroys the rest. Leslie uses mules to pull his car to another refueling point, where Maggie tricks Hezekiah into boarding a train and handcuffs him to a seat, lying to Leslie that Hezekiah had quit and &quot;wanted to go back to New York&quot;.

The two remaining cars reach the Bering Strait and park side by side in a blinding snowstorm. Keeping warm during the storm, Leslie and Maggie begin to see each other as more than competitors. Mishaps, including a polar bear in Fate&#x27;s car, compel all four racers to warm themselves in Leslie&#x27;s car. They awaken on a small ice floe which drifts into their intended Russian port, where Hezekiah is waiting for Leslie, who casts off Maggie for deceiving him. Maggie is snatched by Fate, who drives off in the lead.

After driving across Asia, both cars enter the tiny kingdom of Carpania, whose alcoholic Crown Prince Friedrich Hapnick is the spitting image of Professor Fate. Plotters under the leadership of Baron Rolfe von Stuppe and General Kuhster kidnap the Prince, Fate, Max, and Maggie. Max escapes and joins Leslie to rescue the others. Fate is forced to masquerade as the Prince during the coronation so that the rebels can gain control of the kingdom. Leslie and Max overcome Von Stuppe&#x27;s henchmen and confront Von Stuppe. Following a sword fight with Leslie, Von Stuppe attempts escape by leaping to a waiting boat, but bursts the hull and sinks it. Leslie and Max return the real Prince to the capital in time to defeat Kuhster&#x27;s plan for a military coup. Fate, still masquerading as Prince Hapnick, takes refuge in a bakery but falls into a huge cake. A pie fight ensues involving the racers, the Prince&#x27;s men and the conspirators. The five racers, covered in pie filling, depart Carpania with King Friedrich&#x27;s best wishes.

As the racers leave Pottsdorf (with Maggie now back in Leslie&#x27;s car), it becomes a straight road race to Paris. Nearing Paris, Leslie and Maggie have an argument regarding the roles of men, women and sex in relationships. Leslie stops his car just short of the finish line under the Eiffel Tower to prove that he loves Maggie more than he cares about winning the race. Fate drives past to claim the winner&#x27;s mantle, but becomes indignant that Leslie let him win. Fate demands a rematch: a race back to New York.

The return race commences, with newlyweds Leslie and Maggie now a team. Fate lets them start first, then orders Max to destroy their car with a cannon. The shot misses the Leslie Special, instead knocking down the Eiffel Tower.

==Themes==
Director Blake Edwards based the film on the 1908 New York to Paris Race, very loosely interpreted. On February 12, 1908, the &quot;Greatest Auto Race&quot; began with six entrants, starting in New York City and racing westward across three continents. The destination was Paris, making it the first around-the-world automobile race. Only the approximate race route and the general time period were borrowed by Edwards in his effort to make &quot;the funniest comedy ever&quot;.

Edwards, a studious admirer of silent film, dedicated the film to film comedians Laurel and Hardy. &quot;The Great Race&quot; incorporated a great many silent era visual gags, along with slapstick, double entendres, parodies, and absurdities. The film includes such time-worn scenes as a barroom brawl, the tent of the desert sheik, a sword fight, and the laboratory of the mad scientist. The unintended consequences of Professor Fate&#x27;s order, &quot;Push the button, Max!&quot; is a running gag, along with the spotless invulnerability of The Great Leslie.

Edwards poked fun at later films and literature as well. The saloon brawl scene was a parody of the western film genre, and a plot detour launched during the final third of the film was a direct parody of the novel &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; and of the 1937 film version of the story, where a traveler is a lookalike for the king and stands in for him.

==Production==
Because of the success of Edwards&#x27; previous films &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; and &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, the film&#x27;s budget started at $6 million. Mirisch Productions initially financed the film for United Artists. The film&#x27;s escalating costs led UA to drop the film, but the project was picked up by Warner Brothers.

Edwards wanted Robert Wagner to play the leading man, but studio executive Jack L. Warner insisted on Tony Curtis, possibly because of Wood&#x27;s recent divorce from Wagner. (Burt Lancaster was announced at one stage.) Working with Warner, Curtis&#x27;s new agent Irving &quot;Swifty&quot; Lazar negotiated US$125,000 for Curtis—more than Edwards and Lemmon, who were to receive US$100,000 each. After Warner signed the Curtis contract, Lazar reasoned that Edwards and Lemmon should make US$125,000, and Warner upped its compensation to match Curtis.

Julie Andrews was first approached for the role of Maggie DuBois. Andrews having admired the work of Edwards wanted to work on the film, but was forced to bow out due to delays on &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Andrews would eventually marry Edwards and act in several of his films afterward. Natalie Wood did not want to make &quot;The Great Race&quot;, but Warner talked her into it. Wood was unhappy with her career and her personal life, having been divorced from Robert Wagner in April 1962. Warner asked Curtis if he would give a percentage of his film royalties to Wood as an enticement, but Curtis refused. He said &quot;I couldn&#x27;t give her anything to make her want to do the movie.&quot; Instead of more money, Warner promised Wood that if she completed &quot;The Great Race&quot;, she could star in Gavin Lambert&#x27;s drama &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot;, a role she greatly wished to have. Wood agreed, thinking that filming would be brief on Edwards&#x27; movie.

Shooting began on June 15, 1964. Many of the sight gags for &quot;The Great Race&quot; were expensive to create, and the costs ballooned to US$12 million by the time the film was finished. Edwards, sometimes with Wood in tow, repeatedly visited Warner in his office to ask for more money. Warner approved nearly all of the requests. When it was released, it was the most expensive comedy ever filmed.

Shooting ended in November 1964. During the five months of filming, Wood&#x27;s unhappiness was not visible to the cast and crew, and her characterization of Maggie DuBois was playful. Her sister Lana Wood thought that Wood looked the prettiest she ever had, but Lana sensed that the film &quot;was physically taxing&quot; for Wood. On Friday, November 27, the day after Thanksgiving, Wood wrapped the last bit of dialog work, then went home and swallowed a bottle of prescription pills. Groggy from the drugs, she called her friend Mart Crowley who took her to the hospital for emergency treatment.

Music for the film was by Henry Mancini, and the costumes were designed by Edith Head. Production design, setting the period and augmenting the visual humor, was by Fernando Carrere who had designed &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; for Blake Edwards. The unique slideshow-style title design was by Ken Mundie.

===Custom cars===

The hero&#x27;s white car, the Leslie Special, was built by Warner Brothers to resemble a Thomas Flyer, the car that won the 1908 New York to Paris Race. According to the Petersen Automotive Museum, four &quot;Leslie Specials&quot; were built. One of the four is at the Tupelo Automobile Museum in Tupelo, Mississippi, listed as a 1963 Leslie Special Convertible.

Another of the four appears painted dark green in the 1970 Warner Brothers film &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot;—the grille can be seen bearing the words Leslie Special, with the wheels and tires remaining their original white color. This vehicle shows up during the last 30 minutes of the movie carrying a lead character, and has a pivotal role at the end of the movie.

The villain&#x27;s black car was named the Hannibal Twin-8; five were constructed. One is on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum, powered by a Volkswagen industrial engine. Another is at the Volo Auto Museum in Volo, Illinois. This model includes a prop &quot;cannon&quot; and a working smoke generator. The Volo museum describes the Hannibal Twin-8 as built by Warner Brothers at a cost of US$150,000 ($ in dollars ), powered by a Corvair six-cylinder engine with three-speed manual transmission and six wheels. All four rear wheels are powered by a chain drive.

Both vehicles were first on display at Movie World&#x27;s Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Buena Park, California until the museum closed in the late 1970s. It was located adjacent to the Planes of Fame Museum.

===Pie fight===
The Technicolor scene for the pie fight in the royal bakery was filmed over five days. The first pastry thrown was part of a large cake decorated for the king&#x27;s coronation. Following this was the throwing of 4,000 pies, the most pies ever filmed in a pie fight. The scene lasts four minutes and 20 seconds and cost US$200,000 ($ in dollars ) to shoot; US$18,000 ($ in dollars ) just for the pastry.

Colorful cream pies with fillings such as raspberry, strawberry, blueberry and lemon were used. For continuity between days of shooting, the actors were photographed at the end of each day and then made up the following morning to have the same colorful appearance, the same smears of pie crust and filling.

Edwards told the cast that a pie fight by itself is not funny, so to make it funny they would build tension by having the hero, dressed all in white, fail to get hit with any pies. He said &quot;The audience will start yearning for him to get it&quot;. Finally, the hero was to take a (white) pie in the face at &quot;just the right moment&quot;.

Shooting was halted while the actors took the weekend off. Over the weekend, the pie residue spoiled all over the scenery. When the actors returned Monday morning, the set stank so badly that the building required a thorough cleaning and large fans to blow out the sour air. The missing pie residue was recreated carefully with more pies, and shooting resumed.

At first, the actors had fun with the pie fight assignment, but eventually the process grew wearisome and dangerous. Wood choked briefly on pie filling which hit her open mouth. Lemmon exaggerated that he got knocked out a few times; he said &quot;a pie hitting you in the face feels like a ton of cement&quot;. At the end of shooting, when Edwards called &quot;cut!&quot;, he was barraged with several hundred pies that members of the cast had hidden, waiting for the moment.

The pie fight scene paid homage to the early Mack Sennett practice of using a single thrown pie as comedic punctuation, but to a greater degree, it was a celebration of movie pie fights such as &quot;Behind the Screen&quot; (1916) with Charlie Chaplin; &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot; (1927) starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy; and &quot;In the Sweet Pie and Pie&quot; (1941) with the Three Stooges. In his script for &quot;The Great Race&quot;, Edwards called for a &quot;&quot;Battle of the Century&quot;–style pie fight&quot;. Although Edwards used 4,000 pies over five days, many of these were used as set dressing for continuity. Laurel and Hardy used 3,000 pies in only one day of shooting, so more are seen flying through the air. Leonard Maltin compared &quot;The Great Race&quot; pie fight to &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot; and determined that Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s pacing was far superior, that the more modern film suffered from an &quot;incomplete understanding of slapstick&quot; while the 1927 pie fight remains &quot;one of the great scenes in all of screen comedy.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Great Race&quot; was generally not well-received upon release and critical assessment was mostly negative, making it the first notable failure for director Edwards. Most critics attacked its blatant and overdone slapstick humor and its lack of substance. It also suffered from comparisons with another race-themed &quot;epic comedy&quot; of 1965, &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot;. Film critic Richard Schickel wrote that, although the film &quot;bumps along very pleasantly for the most part&quot;, Edwards failed at his attempt to recreate the slapstick atmosphere of a Laurel and Hardy comedy. Schickel felt that Wood was &quot;hopelessly miscast&quot;, and that the energies of Lemmon and Curtis did not quite make the slapstick work. Maltin wrote that Wood &quot;never looked better&quot; and that the film&#x27;s comedy sometimes worked but was otherwise forced: &quot;a mixed bag&quot;. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 72% based on 25 reviews, with an average score of 6.00/10.

Despite earning theatrical rentals of over $11.4 million in the United States and Canada, due to its high cost, it caused a loss to the studio.

===Awards and nominations===
==Soundtrack==
Before the film was released, the soundtrack was re-recorded in Hollywood by RCA Victor Records for release on vinyl LP. Henry Mancini spent six weeks composing the score, and the recording involved some 80 musicians. Mancini collaborated with lyricist Johnny Mercer on several songs including &quot;The Sweetheart Tree&quot;, a waltz released as a single. The song plays on along the film as the main theme without chorus (except in the entr&#x27; acte) and it was performed onscreen by Natalie Wood with the voice dubbed by Jackie Ward (uncredited). It was nominated for but did not win an Oscar for best song. The full track listing is:

* &quot;He Shouldn&#x27;t-A, Hadn&#x27;t-A, Oughtn&#x27;t-A Swang on Me&quot; – Mancini/Mercer
** Performed by Dorothy Provine
* &quot;Buffalo Gals&quot; – Traditional Western song performed by the chorus girls in Boracho saloon, with different lyrics and a middle section, for a 1900s atmosphere
* &quot;The Sweetheart Tree&quot; (chorus) – Mancini
* &quot;The Royal Waltz&quot; – Mancini
* &quot;Great Race March&quot; – Mancini
* &quot;They&#x27;re Off!&quot; – Mancini
* &quot;Push the Button, Max!&quot; (Professor Fate&#x27;s theme) – Mancini

* &quot;The Beautiful Blue Danube&quot;
** Written by Johann Strauss

==Adaptations==
Slightly in advance of the film&#x27;s release, as was the custom of the era, a paperback novelization of the film was published by Dell Books. The author was renowned crime and western novelist Marvin H. Albert.

The novelization, based on the screenplay rather than the finished film, differs from the film in various aspects. In the novel, the country of Carpania is called Ruritania (as in Hope&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner of Zenda&quot;), Keenan Wynn&#x27;s character is called Jebediah (not Hezekiah) and stays behind in Ruritania, having fallen in love with a local noblewoman. The pie fight is missing, and the drivers are chased by cowboys (rather than native Americans) before arriving in Boracho. A few minor changes concern Leslie&#x27;s courting of Maggie Dubois: in the novelization, it&#x27;s she who suggests sharing the blanket in the snowstorm, and she also gets to drive the Leslie Special when Leslie has his arm in a sling. Scenes not included in the film include: a rainstorm, Fate&#x27;s car sinking in a river, and a more extended stay in Russia (mirroring the Boracho episode).

* Dell Movie Classic: &quot;The Great Race&quot; (March 1966)

==Legacy==
The film was a major influence on &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, a Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. The film&#x27;s characterizations were rather cartoonish. Furthermore, film editor and sound-effects man Treg Brown, who worked on many classic Warner Brothers cartoons, worked on this film. Brown&#x27;s sound design won the film an Oscar. In his Top 10 Favorite Comedies, Doug Walker cited Jack Lemmon&#x27;s performance as Professor Fate as a major influence for his Nostalgia Critic persona.

<doc id="265892" wikidata="Q16269373" url="?curid=265892" title="Pyrethrum">
<text>Pyrethrum was a genus of several Old World plants now classified in either &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot; or &quot;Tanacetum&quot; which are cultivated as ornamentals for their showy flower heads. Pyrethrum continues to be used as a common name for plants formerly included in the genus &quot;Pyrethrum&quot;. Pyrethrum is also the name of a natural insecticide made from the dried flower heads of Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium and Chrysanthemum coccineum. The insecticidal compounds present in these species are pyrethrins.

==Description==
Some members of the genus &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;, such as the following two, are placed in the genus &quot;Tanacetum&quot; instead by some botanists. Both genera are members of the daisy (or aster) family, Asteraceae. They are all perennial plants with a daisy-like appearance and white petals.
* &quot;Tanacetum cinerariifolium&quot; is called the Dalmatian chrysanthemum, denoting its origin in that region of the Balkans (Dalmatia). It looks more like the common daisy than other pyrethrums do. Its flowers, typically white with yellow centers, grow from numerous fairly rigid stems. Plants have blue-green leaves and grow to in height. The plant is economically important as a natural source of pyrethrin insecticides.
* &quot;C. coccineum&quot;, the Persian chrysanthemum, is a perennial plant native to Caucasus and looks somewhat like a daisy. It produces large white, pink or red flowers. The leaves resemble those of ferns, and the plant grows to between in height. The flowering period is June to July in temperate climates (Northern Hemisphere). &quot;C. coccineum&quot; also contains insecticidal pyrethrins, but it is a poor source compared to &quot;C. cinerariifolium&quot;.
* Other species, such as &quot;C. balsamita&quot; and &quot;C. marshalli&quot;, also contain insecticidal substances, but are less effective than the two species mentioned above.

==Insecticides==
The flowers are pulverized and the active components, called pyrethrins, contained in the seed cases, are extracted and sold in the form of an oleoresin. This is applied as a suspension in water or oil, or as a powder. Pyrethrins attack the nervous systems of all insects, and inhibit female mosquitoes from biting. When present in amounts less than those fatal to insects, they still appear to have an insect repellent effect. They are harmful to fish, but are far less toxic to mammals and birds than many synthetic insecticides and are not persistent, being biodegradable and also decompose easily on exposure to light. They are considered to be amongst the safest insecticides for use around food. In 1998 Kenya was producing 90% (over 6,000 tonnes) of the world&#x27;s pyrethrum, called &quot;py&quot; for short. Production in Tanzania and Ecuador is also significant. Currently the world&#x27;s major producer is Tasmania, Australia.

===Sprays===
Pyrethrum has been used for centuries as an insecticide, and as a lice remedy in the Middle East (Persian powder, also known as &quot;Persian pellitory&quot;). It was sold worldwide under the brand Zacherlin by Austrian industrialist J. Zacherl. It is one of the most commonly used non-synthetic insecticides allowed in certified organic agriculture.

The flowers should be dried and then crushed and mixed with water.
* Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides based on natural pyrethrum (pyrethrins); one common example is permethrin. Pyrethrins are often sold in preparations that also contain the synthetic chemical piperonyl butoxide, which enhances the toxicity to insects and is faster acting compared with pyrethrins used alone. These formulations are known as &quot;synergized pyrethrins&quot;.

===Companion planting===
A pheromone produced by these plants attracts ladybug beetles, and at the same time acts as an alarm signal to aphids.

==Toxicity==
=== Mammals ===
Rat and rabbit levels for pyrethrum are high, with doses in some cases of about 1% of the animal&#x27;s body weight required to cause significant mortality. This is similar to fatal levels in synthetic pyrethroids. Nevertheless, pyrethrum should be handled with the same caution as synthetic insecticides: safety equipment should be worn, and mixing with other chemicals should be avoided.

People can be exposed to pyrethrum as a mixture of cinerin, jasmolin, and pyrethrin in the workplace by breathing it in, getting it in the eyes or on the skin, or swallowing it. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for pyrethrum exposure in the workplace as 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 5000 mg/m3, pyrethrum is immediately dangerous to life and health. People exposed to pyrethrum may experience symptoms including pruritus (itching), dermatitis, papules, erythema (red skin), rhinorrhea (runny nose), sneezing, and asthma.

=== Other animals ===
Pyrethrum, specifically the pyrethrin within, is highly toxic to insects including useful pollinators like bees. The risk of killing bees and other beneficial insects is partially reduced by the compound&#x27;s rapid breakdown (a half-life of approximately 12 hours on plants and on the surface of the soil, with about 3% remaining after five days, but persisting several weeks or more if it enters a body of water or is dug into the soil) and its slight insect-repellant activity.

<doc id="265893" wikidata="Q739672" url="?curid=265893" title="Blank verse">
<text>Blank verse is poetry written with regular metrical but unrhymed lines, usually in iambic pentameter. It has been described as &quot;probably the most common and influential form that English poetry has taken since the 16th century&quot;, and Paul Fussell has estimated that &quot;about three quarters of all English poetry is in blank verse&quot;.

The first known use of blank verse in English was by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in his translation of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; (composed ; published posthumously, 1554–1557). He may have been inspired by the Latin original since classical Latin verse did not use rhyme, or possibly he was inspired by Ancient Greek verse or the Italian verse form of &quot;&quot;, both of which also did not use rhyme.

The play &quot;Arden of Faversham&quot; (around 1590 by an unknown author) is a notable example of end-stopped blank verse.

==In English==
The 1561 play &quot;Gorboduc&quot; by Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville was the first English play to use blank verse.

Christopher Marlowe was the first English author to achieve critical fame for his use of blank verse. The major achievements in English blank verse were made by William Shakespeare, who wrote much of the content of his plays in unrhymed iambic pentameter, and John Milton, whose &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; is written in blank verse. Miltonic blank verse was widely imitated in the 18th century by such poets as James Thomson (in &quot;The Seasons&quot;) and William Cowper (in &quot;The Task&quot;). Romantic English poets such as William Wordsworth, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and John Keats used blank verse as a major form. Shortly afterwards, Alfred, Lord Tennyson became particularly devoted to blank verse, using it for example in his long narrative poem &quot;The Princess&quot;, as well as for one of his most famous poems: &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Among American poets, Hart Crane and Wallace Stevens are notable for using blank verse in extended compositions at a time when many other poets were turning to free verse.

Marlowe and then Shakespeare developed its potential greatly in the late 16th century. Marlowe was the first to exploit the potential of blank verse for powerful and involved speech:

Shakespeare developed this feature, and also the potential of blank verse for abrupt and irregular speech. For example, in this exchange from &quot;King John&quot;, one blank verse line is broken between two characters:

Shakespeare also used enjambment increasingly often in his verse, and in his last plays was given to using feminine endings (in which the last syllable of the line is unstressed, for instance lines 3 and 6 of the following example); all of this made his later blank verse extremely rich and varied.

This very free treatment of blank verse was imitated by Shakespeare&#x27;s contemporaries, and led to general metrical looseness in the hands of less skilled users. However, Shakespearean blank verse was used with some success by John Webster and Thomas Middleton in their plays. Ben Jonson, meanwhile, used a tighter blank verse with less enjambment in his comedies &quot;Volpone&quot; and &quot;The Alchemist&quot;.

Blank verse was not much used in the non-dramatic poetry of the 17th century until &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, in which Milton used it with much license. Milton used the flexibility of blank verse, its capacity to support syntactic complexity, to the utmost, in passages such as these:

Milton also wrote &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; and parts of &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; in blank verse.
In the century after Milton, there are few distinguished uses of either dramatic or non-dramatic blank verse; in keeping with the desire for regularity, most of the blank verse of this period is somewhat stiff. The best examples of blank verse from this time are probably John Dryden&#x27;s tragedy &quot;All for Love&quot; and James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;. An example notable as much for its failure with the public as for its subsequent influence on the form is John Dyer&#x27;s &quot;The Fleece&quot;.

At the close of the 18th century, William Cowper ushered in a renewal of blank verse with his volume of kaleidoscopic meditations, &quot;The Task&quot;, published in 1784. After Shakespeare and Milton, Cowper was the main influence on the next major poets in blank verse, teenagers when Cowper published his masterpiece. These were the Lake Poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Wordsworth used the form for many of the &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; (1798 and 1800), and for his longest efforts, &quot;The Prelude&quot; and &quot;The Excursion&quot;. Wordsworth&#x27;s verse recovers some of the freedom of Milton&#x27;s, but is generally far more regular:

Coleridge&#x27;s blank verse is more technical than Wordsworth&#x27;s, but he wrote little of it:

His conversation poems such as &quot;The Eolian Harp&quot; and &quot;Frost at Midnight&quot; are the best known of his blank verse works. The blank verse of Keats in &quot;Hyperion&quot; is mainly modelled on that of Milton, but takes fewer liberties with the pentameter and possesses the characteristic of Keats&#x27;s verse. Shelley&#x27;s blank verse in &quot;The Cenci&quot; and &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; is closer to Elizabethan practice than to Milton&#x27;s.

Of the Victorian writers in blank verse, the most prominent are Tennyson and Robert Browning. Tennyson&#x27;s blank verse in poems like &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;The Princess&quot; is musical and regular; his lyric &quot;Tears, Idle Tears&quot; is probably the first important example of the blank verse stanzaic poem. Browning&#x27;s blank verse, in poems like &quot;Fra Lippo Lippi&quot;, is more abrupt and conversational. Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s 1884 opera, &quot;Princess Ida&quot;, is based on Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Princess&quot;. Gilbert&#x27;s dialogue is in blank verse throughout (although the other 13 Savoy operas have prose dialogue). Below is an extract spoken by Princess Ida after singing her entrance aria &quot;Oh, goddess wise&quot;.

Blank verse, of varying degrees of regularity, has been used quite frequently throughout the 20th century in original verse and in translations of narrative verse. Most of Robert Frost&#x27;s narrative and conversational poems are in blank verse; so are other poems like Wallace Stevens&#x27;s &quot;The Idea of Order at Key West&quot; and &quot;The Comedian as the Letter C&quot;, W. B. Yeats&#x27;s &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, W. H. Auden&#x27;s &quot;The Watershed&quot; and John Betjeman&#x27;s &quot;Summoned by Bells&quot;. A complete listing is impossible, since a sort of loose blank verse has become a staple of lyric poetry, but it would be safe to say that blank verse is as prominent now as it has been any time in the past three hundred years.

==In German==
Blank verse is also common in German literature. It was used by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in the tragedy (&quot;Nathan the Wise&quot;) in 1779, where the lines are 10 or 11 syllables long:

<text>Barb Tarbox, MSM (April 10, 1961 – May 18, 2003) was a Canadian anti-smoking activist. A lifelong smoker dying of lung and brain cancer, she openly discussed her illness, its cause and its consequences, which propelled her to prominence. 

In high school, between the ages of 14 and 16, she was a model for fashion companies and joined many athletics in her school. She wanted to be a part of the popular kids, which were smokers, leading to her taking on smoking at the age of 11. During the last months of Tarbox&#x27;s life she went around Canada teaching young adults about the consequences of smoking and how it looks to be a smoker. She emphasized how she was unable to quit smoking even after she found out that she had cancer. 

Tarbox died at a hospital in Edmonton on May 18, 2003, at the age of 42 from brain cancer and lung cancer.

On December 5, 2003, Barb Tarbox was posthumously awarded the Meritorious Service Medal by Her Excellency, the Right Honourable Adrienne Clarkson, Governor General of Canada, for devotion to the anti-smoking cause. The decoration was accepted in Ottawa by her daughter, Mackenzie.

On December 30, 2010, the Government of Canada unveiled tougher anti-smoking images on their cigarette packaging including two images that feature Barb Tarbox during her last days.

<doc id="265899" wikidata="Q913576" url="?curid=265899" title="Desperation (novel)">
<text>Desperation is a horror novel by American author Stephen King. It was published in 1996 at the same time as its &quot;mirror&quot; novel, &quot;The Regulators&quot;, itself published under King&#x27;s Richard Bachman pseudonym. It was also made into a TV film starring Ron Perlman, Tom Skerritt and Steven Weber in 2006. The two novels represent parallel universes relative to one another, and most of the characters present in one novel&#x27;s world also exist in the other novel&#x27;s reality, albeit in different circumstances.

&quot;Desperation&quot; is a story about several people who, while traveling along the desolated Highway 50 in Nevada, get abducted by Collie Entragian, the deputy of the fictional mining town of Desperation. Entragian uses various pretexts for the abductions, from an arrest for drug possession to &quot;rescuing&quot; a family from a nonexistent gunman. It becomes clear to the captives that Entragian has been possessed by an evil being named Tak, who has control over the surrounding desert wildlife and must change hosts to keep itself alive. They begin to fight for their freedom, sanity and lives before realizing that if they are ever to escape Desperation, they must trap Tak in the place from which he came.

== Plot ==
Peter and Mary Jackson are driving quietly on a desolate Nevada highway when they are pulled over and arrested by the disturbed Collie Entragian. They are taken to the police station of a deserted small mining town named Desperation, where Entragian kills Peter. Several other people are held captive here: the Carver family, whose daughter was also killed by Entragian; Johnny Marinville, a writer who was on a cross-country motorcycle trip to gather new material; and Tom Billingsley, the town veterinarian. Meanwhile, Johnny&#x27;s assistant Steve, who had been trailing him at a distance, finds Johnny&#x27;s bike and searches for him with Cynthia, a hitchhiker.

Entragian takes Ellen Carver with him, and during his absence, the intensely devout Carver son, David, manages to free everyone, and the party takes him on as a spiritual guide. They take refuge in an abandoned theater and are joined by Steve, Cynthia and Audrey, an employee of the mine. They realize that they are the only survivors of a wave of carnage committed by an evil supernatural entity named Tak. Tak had been imprisoned in an old mine shaft and can take possession of human beings, but this possession quickly deteriorates the host and requires Tak to change hosts. Tak can also manipulate desert wildlife such as coyotes, buzzards, spiders and scorpions. Billingsley is killed by a cougar controlled by Tak, and Audrey, also under its influence, attempts to kill David. She nearly succeeds in strangling him, but is prevented by the intervention of Steve and Johnny. Tak occupies Ellen&#x27;s body and takes Mary captive.

The survivors contemplate leaving the town, but David, having come out of a trance, reveals to them that God has other plans for them. Mary takes advantage of the rapid deterioration of Ellen&#x27;s body to escape her, and upon Ellen&#x27;s death, Tak occupies the body of a golden eagle. The group gather some ANFO to blow up the well from which Tak escaped. Tak attacks David, but kills his self-sacrificing father Ralph. Johnny prevents the now-orphaned David from giving his own life, and takes his place by blowing up the well and sealing Tak inside. David, Mary, Steve and Cynthia begin to leave the town of Desperation. While in Mary&#x27;s car, David finds in his pocket the hall pass from his previous &quot;deal with God&quot; with a message from Johnny written on it.

== Release and adaptation ==
King was inspired to write &quot;Desperation&quot; as a result of a cross-country drive in 1991, during which he visited the small desert community of Ruth, Nevada, near U.S. Route 50. His first thought was that the town&#x27;s inhabitants were all dead. He then wondered who had killed them, and the idea occurred to him that the town&#x27;s sheriff had done so. &quot;Desperation&quot; was released simultaneously with the novel &quot;The Regulators&quot; (published by King under the name Richard Bachman). In 2006, American network ABC broadcast a television film based on Stephen King&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of his novel. The film was directed by frequent King collaborator Mick Garris and stars Ron Perlman, Tom Skerritt, Steven Weber and Annabeth Gish.

<text>Women and girls have participated in sports, physical fitness, and exercise throughout history. However, the extent of their involvement has varied depending on factors such as country, time, geographical location, and level of economic development (Coakley, 2009; Hargreaves, 1994). The modern era of organized sports, with structured competitions and formalized activities, did not fully emerge for either women or men until the late industrial age (Cahn, 1994). This shift marked a significant change in how sports were structured and practiced, eventually leading to more inclusive opportunities for female participation (Eitzen, 2009).

Until roughly 1870, women&#x27;s activities tended to be informal and recreational in nature, lacked rules codes, and emphasized physical activity rather than competition. Today, women&#x27;s sports are more sport-specific and have developed into both amateur levels and professional levels in various places internationally, but is found primarily within developed countries where conscious organization and accumulation of wealth has occurred. In the mid-to-latter part of the 20th century, female participation in sport and the popularization of their involvement increased, particularly during its last quarter. Very few organized sports have been invented by women. Sports such as Newcomb ball, netball, acrobatic gymnastics, and tumbling, and possibly stoolball, are examples.

Women&#x27;s involvement in sports is more visible in well-developed countries and today their level of participation and performance still varies greatly by country and by sport. Despite an increase in women&#x27;s participation in sport, the male demographic is still the larger of the two. These demographic differences are observed globally. Female dominated sports are the one exception. Girls&#x27; participation in sports tend to be higher in the United States than in other parts of the world like Western Europe and Latin America. Girls&#x27; participation in more violent contact sports is far less than that of their male counterparts.

Two important divisions exist in relation to female sporting categories. These sports either emerged exclusively as an organized female sport with male exclusion or were developed as an organized female variant of a sport first popularized by a male demographic and therefore became a female category. In all but a few exceptional cases, such as in the case of camogie, a female variant, or &quot;women&#x27;s game&quot; uses the same name of the sport popularly played by men, but is classified into a different category which is differentiated by sex: men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s, or girls or boys. Female variants are widely common while organized female sports by comparison are rare and include team sports such as netball, throwball, artistic (née synchronized) swimming, and ringette. In female sports, the supposed benefits of gender parity, gender equity and sex segregation are controversial.

Except in a few rare cases like women&#x27;s professional tennis, professional women&#x27;s sport rarely provide competitors with a livable income. In addition, competing for media coverage of the women&#x27;s variant of a sport which is primarily popular among males, creates complex barriers. More recently, there has been an increasing amount of interest, research, investment and production in regards to equipment design for female athletes. Interest and research involving the identification of sex-specific injuries, particularly though not exclusively among high performance female athletes, has increased as well, such as in the case of concussions and the female athlete triad, &quot;Relative energy deficiency in sport&quot; (RED-S).

At times female athletes have engaged in social activism in conjunction with their participation in sport. Protest methods have included playing strikes, social media campaigns, and in the case of America, federal lawsuits on grounds of inequality, usually as it relates to gender parity principles, American law and Title IX which demand schools that any funds given to support students&#x27; sports should be equally distributed between boys and girls. Public service oriented promotional campaigns for girls in sport involve a variety of media campaign styles.
==History==

===Ancient civilizations===
Before each ancient Olympic Games a separate women&#x27;s athletic event was held at the stadium in Olympia, called the Heraean Games and was dedicated to the goddess Hera. In ancient Greek mythology there was the belief that Heraea was founded by Hippodameia, the wife of the king who founded the Olympics. According to E. Norman Gardiner:

Although married women were excluded from the Olympics even as spectators, Cynisca won an Olympic game as owner of a chariot (champions of chariot races were owners not riders), as did Euryleonis, Belistiche, Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione, Timarete, Theodota and Kassia.

After the classical period, there was some participation by women in men&#x27;s athletic festivals. Women in Sparta began to practice the same athletic exercises that men did, exhibiting the qualities of Spartan soldiers. Plato even supported women in sports by advocating running and sword-fighting for women.

Notably, cultural representations of a pronounced female physicality were not limited to sport in Ancient Greece and can also be found in representations of a group of warrioresses known as the Amazons.

In Book Six of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Nausicaa and her handmaidens engage in light sport as they&#x27;re waiting for the clothes they&#x27;ve washed to dry ...

::::::Then they bathed, and gave
:Their limbs the delicate oil, and took their meal
:Upon the river&#x27;s border⁠—while the robes
:Beneath the sun&#x27;s warm rays were growing dry.
:And now, when they were all refreshed by food,
:Mistress and maidens laid their veils aside
:And played at ball.

===Early modern===

During the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, women played in professional Cuju teams. Cuju, also known as Tsu Chu, was an ancient Chinese ball game that is considered to be the predecessor of modern-day football (soccer). The sport of Cuju reached climax in the Song dynasty and was one of the most popular sports in Chinese society during that time. It was first recorded in the 3rd century BC and was played by both men and women. Women&#x27;s Cuju was different from men&#x27;s Cuju in a few ways. First, the women&#x27;s ball was smaller and lighter. Second, the women played with smaller teams and on a smaller field. Third, the women were not allowed to use their hands or feet to touch the ball. Instead, they used their heads and chests to control the ball. Women&#x27;s Cuju was a popular sport for centuries in China. It was played by women of all social classes and ages. The game was often played during festivals and holidays.
===Modern era===
====Late 17th century====

The educational committees of the French Revolution (1789) included intellectual, moral, and physical education for both girls and boys. With the victory of Napoleon less than twenty years later, physical education was reduced to military preparedness for boys and men. In Germany, the physical education of GutsMuths (1793) included girl&#x27;s education. This included the measurement of performances of girls. This led to women&#x27;s sport being more actively pursued in Germany than in most other countries. When the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale was formed as an all women&#x27;s international organization it had a German male vice-president in addition to German international success in elite sports.

====19th and early 20th centuries====

Few women competed in sports in Europe and North America before the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. Those who did participate often faced disapproval. Early women&#x27;s professional sports leagues during the early part of the 20th century foundered. These women&#x27;s &quot;sports&quot; were more focused on fitness, beauty, weight and health.

Women&#x27;s sports in the late 1800s focused on correct posture, facial and bodily beauty, muscles, and health. Before 1870, activities for women were recreational rather than sport-specific and emphasized physical activity rather than competition. Sports for women before the 20th century placed more emphasis on fitness rather than the competitive aspects we now associate with organized sports.

In 1916 the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) held its first national championship for women (in swimming), In 1923 the AAU also sponsored the First American Track &amp; Field championships for women. Earlier that year the Women&#x27;s Amateur Athletic Association (WAAA) held the first WAAA Championships.

Bicycling became a popular activity among women in the suffragette era. &quot;Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world,&quot; Susan B. Anthony said. &quot;I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance.&quot;

====The Olympics and women====
The first Olympic games in the modern era in 1896 were not open to women. Since then the number of women who have participated in the Olympic games have increased substantially. Many girls and women had lots of opportunities to join the Olympics.
The modern Olympics had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf. The International Olympic Committee founder Pierre de Coubertin described women&#x27;s sports &quot;impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic, and we are not afraid to add: incorrect&quot;. However, the 6th IOC Congress in Paris 1914 decided that a woman&#x27;s medal had formally the same weight as a man&#x27;s in the official medal table. This left the decisions about women&#x27;s participation to the individual international sports federations. Concern over the physical strength and stamina of women led to the discouragement of female participation in more physically strenuous sports.

In response to the lack of support for women&#x27;s international sport the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale was founded in France by Alice Milliat. This organization initiated the Women&#x27;s Olympiad (held 1921, 1922 and 1923) and the Women&#x27;s World Games, which attracted participation of nearly 20 countries and was held four times (1922, 1926, 1930 and 1934). In 1924 the 1924 Women&#x27;s Olympiad was held at Stamford Bridge in London. The International Olympic Committee began to incorporate greater participation of women at the Olympics in response. The number of Olympic women athletes increased over five-fold in the period, going from 65 at the 1920 Summer Olympics to 331 at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women&#x27;s sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many Olympic sports, including women&#x27;s sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur. The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women&#x27;s athletic programs in this period.

==20th-century United States to the present==
===Implementation and regulation of Title IX===

====Overview====
In 1972 the United States Congress passed the Title IX legislation as a part of the additional Amendment Act to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title IX states that: &quot;no person shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance&quot;; Title IX prohibits discrimination based on sex in schools receiving federal funds through grants, scholarships, or other support for students. The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional sex-based discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities.

Contrary to popular belief, Title IX initially had nothing to do with sports and would not include interscholastic or varsity sports until later. Today the law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are considered necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.

Important changes regarding athletics and sport occurred in 1975:
In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX in regards to athletics and sport; it became known as the &quot;three-part test&quot;.

# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for women and men are &quot;substantially proportionate&quot; to their respective undergraduate enrollment.
# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).
# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.

Schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs.

;Compliance standards
A 1999 study by Sigelman and Wahlbeck found many schools were &quot;nowhere near compliance&quot;. Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men&#x27;s programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved. Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.

According to research done by the National Women&#x27;s Law Center in 2011, 4500 public high schools across the nation exhibited high rates of gender inequality and were considered to be in violation of the Title IX laws. Further research done by the Women&#x27;s Law Center in 2017 found schools with a high number of minority students and a higher number of people of color, mainly found in the southern American states, had a much higher rate of gender disparity. A large disparity gap regarding sport-related scholarships for women and men, with men getting 190 million more in funding than women, was also found. Despite an increase in participation in sports by girls and women, this pattern persists. Most colleges focus on their male athletics teams and invest more money into those already successful programs. This disparity is presented by some feminist ideologues as a phenomenon illustrating a cause and effect link between race and gender, and how it plays a significant role in the hierarchy of sports.

====Effect of Title IX on women&#x27;s sports====
It is widely believed that Title IX has had a positive effect on women&#x27;s sports in America and aided their participation. American female athletes now have grounds to help support the stance that women athletes deserve a higher level of respect and consideration that is necessary in order for their participation. Women&#x27;s involvement in sports has helped raise the recognition of their sports programs and competitive athletes to a level comparable to that which men have enjoyed for many years.

While the mandate did not immediately go into effect it had been publicized to such an extent that it enabled the general public to sense its future implications. There had been great anticipation for the bill prior to its passage which helped it gain media coverage in time for when the bill was mandated to be followed.

====Post Title IX====


The involvement in women&#x27;s sports spiked after Title IX was put into place, mostly in high school level sports as well as collegiate.
Title IX&#x27;s effect on women in sport was observed to have far reaching implications that were not restricted to those who were participating in a professional or intermediate way. Girls and women who did not see themselves in a more &quot;serious athlete&quot; light felt increasingly empowered to participate and compete.

The bill allowed for the equal treatment of female athletes to become a part of the larger sports institution and culture and is considered to have played an important role in increasing the popular view in America that female participation and competition in sport was a valid part of society and life. Although a lot has changed since the implementation of Title IX, high school girls still remain to have less access to sports opportunities than males did in 1972. On a college basis as well, female athletes are receiving significantly lower amounts in athletic scholarships compared to their male counterparts with a notable gap of $252 million.

==== Participation in America ====
Title IX is American law. The purpose of the Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972 was to update Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned several forms of discrimination in employment but did not address or mention discrimination in education. Contrary to popular belief, the creation of Title IX had nothing to do with sports. Women&#x27;s sports were not considered a relevant issue within educational organizations at the time. It was not until later that Title IX involved a new objective to ensure equal treatment in organized sports and schools regardless of sex, in a federally funded program. However, Title IX is most commonly associated with its impact on American athletics and more specifically the impact it has had on women&#x27;s participation in athletics at every age.
Since Title IX became law, records have illustrated an increasing number of opportunities in American educational institutions in a variety of sports for women and girls. As of the 2007–2008 school year, females made up 41% of the participants in college athletics. In 1971–1972 there were 294,015 females participating in high school athletics and in 2007–2008 there were over three million females participating, a 940% increase in female participation in high school athletics. In 1971–1972 there were 29,972 females participating in college athletics and in 2007–2008 there were 166,728 females participating, a 456% increase in female participation in college athletics. In 1971, less than 300,000 females played in high school sports. After the law was passed many females started to get involved in sports. By 1990, eighteen years later, 1.9 million female high school students were playing sports.

American studies have investigated whether or not there is a strong correlation between female participation in sport and positive outcomes in women&#x27;s education and employment later on in life. A 2010 study found that the changes set in motion by Title IX explained about 20 percent of the increase in women&#x27;s education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women. This is not to say that all women who are successful later on in life played sports, but it is saying that women who did participate in athletics received benefits in their education and employment later on in life.

In 1971, fewer than 295,000 girls participated in high school varsity athletics, accounting for just 7 percent of all varsity athletes; in 2001, that number leaped to 2.8 million, or 41.5 percent of all varsity athletes, according to the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education. In 1966, 16,000 females competed in intercollegiate athletics. By 2001, that number jumped to more than 150,000, accounting for 43 percent of all college athletes. In addition, a 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women&#x27;s collegiate sports had grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women in America are, in order: (1) basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team, (2) volleyball, 95.7%, (3) soccer, 92.0%, (4) cross country, 90.8%, and (5) softball, 89.2%. Since 1972, women have also competed in the traditional male sports of wrestling, weightlifting, rugby, and boxing. An article in the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported lasting benefits for women from Title IX, citing a correlation between participation in sports and increased educational opportunities as well as employment opportunities for girls. Furthermore, the athletic participation by girls and women spurred by Title IX was associated with lower obesity rates while other public health program failed to claim similar success.

==== Participation in leadership roles ====
Although female participation in sports has increased due to Title IX, there has not been a similar effect in terms of women holding coaching or other managerial positions in sports. Most sport teams or institutions, regardless of gender, are managed by male coaches and managers. For example, according to 2016 data, 33% of WNBA teams are led by women coaches or managers. The International Olympic Committee also consists of 20% female members. The data presented also showed that 15% of athletic directors in colleges nationwide were females, and that number is much less in the southern states. There are various reasons that have been suggested to account for this trend. Messner and Bozada-Deas (2009) suggest traditional gender roles may play a role and that society&#x27;s historical division of labor leads to men volunteering as team coaches and women volunteering as team &quot;moms&quot;. Everhart and Chelladurai (1998) show that this phenomenon may be part of a larger cycle --- girls who are coached by men growing up are less likely to view themselves as coaches when they are adults, and so the number of female coaches decreases, meaning more girls are coached by men.

==Canada==


Organized sports hold a high priority status in Canadian culture, The growth of female participation in sport in Canada has historically been slower than that among males. One notable exception is the female sport of ringette, which is not a variant of a popular men&#x27;s sport and whose players are predominantly female. Different arguments exist as to why there are less female participants in sport in Canada and what factors are and should be considered most relevant.

===Academic prejudice===

In most cases, Canadian studies involving female participation in sport fail to involve methodologies that account for and make observable the difference between participation rates in exclusively or predominantly female sports such as artistic (née synchronized) swimming and ringette in comparison to sports involving male and female categories of the same sport, such as basketball.

===Canadian feminists in sport===

In Canada, the majority of feminist ideologues in sport claim slow growth in participation in girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s sports programs (with male and female categories) are due to a number of factors. While both girls and women have historically had low levels of interest and participation, sports feminists in Canada have contended that these differences are largely due to patriarchy and the fact that there are fewer women than men in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs, athletics, and coaching.

In Canada as well as in other societies worldwide, organized sports have been used and viewed as a traditional way to demonstrate and develop masculinity. With an increasing number of girls and women with a serious interest in sports, the cross-cultural divide between the sexes began to narrow with the male sports establishment becoming actively hostile. During the 1960s with the arrival of second wave feminism, a number of feminists dismissed female sports and thought of them as an unworthy cause and one in no need of their support.

Among other feminists, women&#x27;s progress in sport involved the belief that their needed to be an effort to counter a common and unfounded notion that vigorous physical activity was dangerous for women. These notions where first challenged around 1900. These women, called, &quot;new women&quot;, started with bicycling. By the 1920s, a marked change for women occurred involving young working-class women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen. However, more recent scientific research in the sport sciences, particularly sports medicine have shown differences between women and men in terms of types of sports injuries, their rate of occurrence, and injury recovery times. Female athletes participating in contact and combat sports are an area of particular concern, especially in the case of concussions. Concern also involves consequences to women during pregnancy.

===Differences in codes===
Historically, regional differences in Canada are recorded to have existed in regards to codified rules in sport involving male and female programs. One such example involves the Eastern provinces of Canada which for a time included a different game code for the female category of basketball, while the Western provinces opted for a simplified identical rules structure in relation to both sexes. This disparity is claimed as evidence of sexism among the more radical feminist polemicists in Canadian sport.

=== First elite all-female winter team sports league ===

Canada is home to the first elite all-female winter team sports league in North America, the National Ringette League (NRL). The league was established for the sport of ringette in Canada in 2004. The league recruits the best ringette talent in North America, largely from Canada, but some players originate from Finland or the United States. The league&#x27;s players are unpaid as the league is not a professional one and acts as a showcase league instead.

Ringette was created exclusively for females in Canada in 1963 and excluded male athletes. As a result, the elite level of the sport consists entirely of players who are women. Because the sport has developed a female category, and a male category does not exist, the league has no opportunity to form a partnership with a male league counterpart. However, it does not have to compete with the men&#x27;s sports leagues themselves, unlike professional women&#x27;s soccer leagues, the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) which must contend with the men&#x27;s NBA or the North American women&#x27;s Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League (PWHL) which must contend with the men&#x27;s NHL.

==Germany==

Female athletic dominance grew during the Weimar period in Germany with several factors contributing to this new era. Many opportunities made it possible for women to join sports programs and push boundaries within society. These included the enrollment of women in German universities, the rise in female employment, as well as involvement in war industries. All of these are examples of economic changes due to World War I. Women&#x27;s fashion reflected the changes that women perceived in themselves. Women&#x27;s magazines showed them in sporting outfits as they were motivated to create an appearance that featured them as healthy and fit. The same women were known at night in more fashionable outfits, displaying femininity. Women were becoming more competitive in sport. The competitive sports that women began participating in, included swimming, ski-jumping, and soccer. Participation in masculine sports including boxing and weightlifting, drew the attention of the press. The growing participation of women in sport also sparked a rise in satirical exaggerations of women that downplayed their role in the athletic world. Pictures of women in sporting attire were produced with the intention of publicizing a negative image of their bodies as a consequence of their participation in sport. As issues surrounding women&#x27;s sexuality began to grow in the public sphere, women also gained more publicity and attention in relationship to their place in sports.

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom has produced a range of major international sports including: association football, rugby (union and league), cricket, netball, darts, golf, tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, bowls, rounders, modern rowing, field hockey, boxing, snooker, billiards, and curling. In the 19th century, women primarily participated in the &quot;new games&quot; which included golf, lawn tennis, cycling, and field hockey. Now, women also participate at a professional/international level in soccer, rugby, cricket, and netball.

Since the late 1980s, Women in Sport, a non-profit organization based in London, has hoped to transform sport for the benefit of women and girls in the UK.

The Henley Royal Regatta, more recently allowed women to compete at this prestigious rowing race. Although the benefits that men receive at this race versus what women receive is still drastically different, there is progress within allowing women to compete competitively.

===1800s to present===
In the early 1800s women romped, skated, played ball games and some even boxed. The early half of the 1900s saw an increase in interest in regards to the development of physical education programs for public schools for both sexes as well as developing public recreation programming and facilities ( parks and recreation) which became a new emerging field.

By 1920 women&#x27;s football had become extremely popular, largely due to the suspension of men&#x27;s football due to war efforts. Matches were held with large numbers of spectators, with the Boxing Day match at St Helens in 1920 reaching 53,000 fans-an attendance record that would not be beaten until Team GB beat Brazil at Wembley during the London 2012 Olympics 92 years later.

One year later, the Football Association voted to ban women&#x27;s game from FA-Affiliated grounds for 51 years. The FA&#x27;s Consultative Committee&#x27;s ruling stated:
&quot;Complaints having been made as to football being played by women, Council felt impelled to express the strong opinion that the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged. Complaints have also been made as to the conditions under which some of the matches have been arranged and played, and the appropriation of receipts to other than charitable objects. The Council are further of the opinion that an excessive proportion of the receipts are absorbed in expenses and an inadequate percentage devoted to charitable objects. For these reasons the Council requests the Clubs belonging to the Association refuse the use of their grounds for such matches.&quot;

Beginning in the 1970s, women&#x27;s tennis grew as a popular professional sport and provided the occasion for a symbolic &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, which King won. The contest was strictly for show after Riggs bragged he would win, despite his age and lack of fitness. Nevertheless, the competition gained media popular media exposure thus enhancing the profile of female athletics.

The later success of Serena and Venus Williams helped raise the profile of women&#x27;s tennis again, but faced hostility once in the media spotlight. They were critiqued for their personal upbringings, their muscular builds, and the clothes they wore. James McKay and Helen Johnson described them as &quot;Ghetto Cinderellas&quot;.
Women&#x27;s professional team sports began to achieve prominence in the 1990s, particularly in basketball and football (soccer). The WNBA was formed and the first Women&#x27;s World Cups and women&#x27;s Olympic soccer matches were held.

In 1999, at the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final in Pasadena, California, after scoring the fifth kick in the penalty shootout to give the United States the win over China in the final game, Brandi Chastain celebrated by spontaneously taking off her jersey and falling to her knees in a sports bra. While removing a jersey in celebration of a goal was common in men&#x27;s soccer, it was highly unusual in women&#x27;s football at the international level. The image of her celebration has been considered one of the more famous and controversial photographs of a woman celebrating an athletic victory. In 2019, it was announced that a statue of Chastain&#x27;s celebration would be displayed at the Rose Bowl to commemorate the twenty-year anniversary of the team&#x27;s win.

Girls&#x27; participation in more violent contact sports is far less than their male counterparts. In such sports, boys overwhelmingly outnumber girls, particularly American football, wrestling, and boxing.

Leagues for girls do exist in such sports, such as the Utah Girls Football League and Professional Girl Wrestling Association. Katie Hnida became the first woman ever to score points in a Division I NCAA American football game when she kicked two extra points for the University of New Mexico in 2003. In 2023, Haley Van Voorhis became the first woman to play a non-kicking position in NCAA football, playing as a safety for Division III Shenandoah.

Heather Watson and Fu Yuanhui were considered to have challenged a taboo in women&#x27;s sport when both openly admitted they were menstruating, Watson after a self-described poor performance in a tennis match in 2015, and Fu at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

==Female sports==
&quot;Female sports&quot; are rare and have been created specifically for the female sex and are not variants of popular men&#x27;s sports. While sports which involve female participation are often collectively called, &quot;women&#x27;s sports&quot;, the overwhelming majority are not, and are in fact &quot;female variants&quot; &quot;the female equivalent&quot; of sports which were first played by and popularized by men and boys, making these two sporting groups distinct.

Some female sports can be traced back to a single inventor while others cannot and are difficult to identify. Some female sports are or can be attributed to a variety of individuals who helped contribute to its early development instead.

Below is a list of female sports.

== Professional sports ==
=== Overview ===
Professional sports refers to sports in which athletes are paid for their performance. Opportunities for women to play professional sports vary by country. Some women&#x27;s professional sports leagues are directly affiliated with a men&#x27;s professional sports league like the WNBA. Others are independently owned and operated like the Professional Women&#x27;s Hockey League.

While women today do have the opportunity to play professional sports, the pay for women&#x27;s professional sports is significantly lower than it is in men&#x27;s professional sports. An American feminist theory known as the gender pay gap in sports is an attempt to explain the causes behind these differences.

It is not uncommon for professional athletes hold second jobs in order to supplement their income due to low salary. Female professional athletes often play in smaller lower-quality facilities than male professional athletes due to low attendance. Women&#x27;s professional sports are rarely broadcast regularly on live television. New developments in digital technology have created an opportunity for female leagues to live-stream competitions and events on social media platforms such as Twitter or Twitch instead.

Women face increasing challenges once they look to enter the business side of sports. Some research suggests that women occupy leadership positions in the sports industry at a lower rate than men however, the majority of these are positions are in men&#x27;s professional sports rather than women&#x27;s. When women do occupy the same positions as men, they may be paid less, although some research has shown revenue-specific variables may be more relevant than gender-specific variables when examining compensation levels.

Although several professional women&#x27;s sports leagues have been established throughout the world in the post-Title IX era, they are generally behind in terms of exposure, funding, and attendance compared to the men&#x27;s teams. However, there are notable exceptions. The 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup final was the most-watched soccer game ever in the United States. And in 2017, Portland Thorns FC of the NWSL had higher average attendance than several men&#x27;s professional teams, including 15 NBA teams, 13 NHL teams, and 1 MLB team. The Thorns&#x27; 2019 season saw an even higher average attendance of 20,098. This was higher than all but one of the 30 NBA teams in the 2018–19 season, all but three of the 31 NHL teams in the 2018–19 season, 15 of the 24 MLS teams in the 2019 season, and 6 of the 30 MLB teams in the 2019 season.

On August 30, 2023, the Nebraska Cornhuskers women&#x27;s volleyball team hosted the Omaha Mavericks in front of 92,003 spectators at Memorial Stadium, setting a new documented attendance record for a women&#x27;s sporting event. The record for a professional women&#x27;s sporting event–91,648 spectators at Camp Nou—was set in 2022 by FC Barcelona Femení during a UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League match.

In April 2024, the 2023–24 A-League Women season set the record for the most attended season of any women&#x27;s sport in Australian history, with the season recording a total attendance of 284,551 on 15 April 2024, and finishing with a final total attendance of 312,199.

=== Active women&#x27;s professional leagues and associations ===

===Battle for equality===

Equal representation in organized sport for girls and women is commonly referred to as the &quot;battle for equality&quot; and includes a variety of competing feminist ideologies. Worldwide, the dominant representative sex in sport is male both financially and globally except in the rare case of sports created specifically for girls and women and certain sport disciplines. Sports dominated by women instead of men are few and the majority of organized sports dubbed &quot;women&#x27;s sports&quot; or the &quot;women&#x27;s game&quot; were created as the female equivalent of sports which were first popularized by men and male athletes. Over time there have been gradual and increasing efforts by different groups, individuals and lobbies in different countries to find ways which enable women to gain equal representation and support like their male counterparts. This change can be witnessed at the national level in different countries and in women&#x27;s professional leagues. In terms of finding ways to acquire better pay and better funding, efforts largely began in the 20th century. A significant historical marker occurred during the 2012 London Olympics where it became the first Olympic games in which women competed in every sport.

In some areas, sex and gender can serve as a selective and primary factor in terms of determining if women&#x27;s sports should receive the same treatment as men&#x27;s. Whether or not women are as able-bodied as men can serve as the basis of decision making criteria. Gender-based characteristics associated with masculinity and femininity can become the deciding factor for individuals in terms of their potential sports participation, but can also affect organizing sporting bodies where this has been held as a justifiable dismissal of sports equity for female participants.

Although there are various goals and reasons behind organized team sports participation in Western cultures, one perspective claims that sport is principally organized around the political project of physically and symbolically elevating men over women. One study has claimed that notions of audience interest or preference were based on personal beliefs and assumptions rather than evidence or research and that in some cases these beliefs and assumptions were the reason why coverage of men&#x27;s professional sports is prioritized.

;Pay gap

The pay gap in women sports is a controversial issue. Women athletes, in their respective sports, are often paid far less than their male counterparts. The difference between the American women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s soccer teams&#x27; salaries has been used as an example regarding pay inequality. Women on the U.S. national team earned $99,000 per year, while men earned $263,320 if they were to win 20 exhibition matches. There is a substantial gap in rewards in regards to winning the FIFA World Cup. The German men&#x27;s national team earned 35 million dollars, while the American women&#x27;s national team earned 2 million dollars after winning the World Cup. The battle in equality for fair pay divulges in to other sports in which men earn far more than women. Golf is another sport which has a significant rising female presence. In 2014, the PGA Tour awarded US$340 million in prize money for men&#x27;s tournaments, compared to 62 million dollars awarded to the LPGA Tour. Basketball is another sport which has surged in popularity in the last few decades and has significant female presence. In the United States, the NBA organizes top-level professional basketball competition for both sexes, with men playing in the NBA proper and women in the WNBA. As of 2021, a WNBA player&#x27;s minimum salary is $57,000, while an NBA player&#x27;s minimum salary is $898,310. An average NBA player makes over $5 million while an average WNBA player makes $72,000. In September 2018, the World Surf League announced equal pay for both male and female athletes for all events, contributing to the conversation in the world of professional sports surrounding equality.

;Social media
The advent of social media has had a positive impact on women&#x27;s sports by providing more platforms for advertising and conversation. It has created more opportunities to increase the promotion of women&#x27;s sports and helped form the establishment of communities both online and offline around women&#x27;s and girls sports, including access to women&#x27;s sports news. This pattern is expected to continue into the future and has been presented as a powerful tool to help offset the issues of gender bias and other disparities.

====Australia====

In September 2015, the Australia women&#x27;s national soccer team (nicknamed the Matildas) announced that it had canceled a sold-out tour of the United States due to a dispute with Football Federation Australia (FFA; known since November 2020 as Football Australia) over their pay. Their salary was below minimum wage levels in Australia. The Matildas requested health care, maternity leave, and improved travel arrangements, as well as an increased salary. The players also said that their low salaries forced them to remain living at home, since they could not afford rent, and their strict training schedule meant they were unable to get another job.

In September 2017, a new pay deal was announced for players in Australia&#x27;s national soccer league, the W-League. The deal included an increase in wages, an increase in the salary cap, improved medical standards, and a formal maternity policy. Some commentators have attributed the success of the new W-League deal to the Matildas&#x27; boycott in 2015.

In November 2019, the FFA announced a new contract with the union Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) in which the Matildas and the men&#x27;s national team (the Caltex Socceroos) will receive equal shares of total player revenue and equal resources. In addition, the guaranteed minimum salary for a player on the Matildas will increase as a result of this deal.

In December 2020, Football Australia announced that it had unbundled the Australian Professional Leagues (APL) from the rest of the governing body, giving APL control of operational, commercial, and marketing for the top level of women&#x27;s, men&#x27;s, and youth soccer in the country. APL soon rebranded the W-League as A-League Women.

====China====

One of the earliest examples of women&#x27;s sports in modern China was Qiu Jin. Qiu Jin, a Chinese revolutionary during the late 1800s and early 1900s, trained women to be soldiers alongside men in sports societies. They were taught fencing, riding, and gymnastics. According to Susan Bronwell, the most important moment for women&#x27;s sports in China came in 1981 with a Chinese victory in the 1981 FIVB Women&#x27;s World Cup in Tokyo, Japan. This victory made the female volleyball players household names in China, though the victory was portrayed as the work of leading male government officials like Ma Qiwei, He Long, and Zhou Enlai, who helped contribute at various stages to the success of the team. The victory symbolized a growth of women&#x27;s sports in China after the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, wherein many athletes were suppressed: In 1994, the International Society for Sports Psychiatry (ISSP) treated many athletes. Like teaching and collaborating with clinicians in sports medicine, helping fairness in sports, etc.


Contemporary Chinese sports teams are noted for their wide breadth of participation by female athletes, specifically in the Olympic Games. A Herfindahl Index (a measure often used in economics to show the degree of concentration when individuals are classified by type, and a lower number indicates higher diversity) showing Female Participation in the 2012 Olympics indicated China&#x27;s female Olympic delegation, the fourth largest present, to be the second most spread out across all events at 0.050, compared to higher numbers from over 190 other delegations. The same index showed the ratio of women to men to be 7 to 10. 213 total female athletes participated. In total, approximately 60% of Chinese Olympic gold medals were earned by female athletes over the last 8 Olympic games. Challenges to equality remain such as media representation. According to Yu Chia Chen, female Asian athletes receive much less coverage than their male counterparts. Another report indicates Chinese girls and women are also less likely to be exposed to sports programming on television.

===Latin America===
In recent years, Latin America has witnessed a notable surge in the growth and accomplishments of women in sports, despite enduring challenges such as unequal funding and cultural stereotypes. Female athletes from the region have excelled across various disciplines, leaving a profound impact both globally and locally. Icons like Marta Vieira da Silva from Brazil, Luciana Aymar from Argentina, and Paola Longoria from Mexico have not only achieved international recognition but have also significantly raised the profile of women&#x27;s sports in their respective countries and beyond.

In team sports such as football (soccer) and individual sports like athletics and racquetball, Latin American women have consistently demonstrated their competitive drive. In Latin America, women athletes have achieved significant milestones across diverse sports, overcoming challenges such as limited funding and cultural biases. Other athletes include Vanessa Zambotti in judo (Mexico), Silvana Lima in surfing (Brazil), María Espinoza in taekwondo (Mexico), Yuderqui Contreras in weightlifting (Dominican Republic), Fabiola Molina in swimming (Brazil) and Mariana Pajón in BMX (Colombia) have not only excelled in their disciplines but have also become symbols of inspiration for aspiring athletes across the region. Their success underscores the growing prominence and impact of women&#x27;s sports in Latin America, fostering a future where gender equity and athletic excellence go hand in hand.

====Ireland====
In October 2017, the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) advertised an available position for head coach of the Irish women&#x27;s national rugby team. The job was advertised as &quot;part-time&quot;, &quot;casual&quot;, and available on six-month basis. Players expressed their disagreement with the decision, believing it was a sign that the IRFU was disrespecting and not prioritizing the women&#x27;s game. In response to this announcement, the players highlighted what they perceived as the IRFU&#x27;s lack of commitment to the long-term development of the women&#x27;s game by wearing bracelets with &quot;#Legacy&quot; written on them for games with their club teams in the All Ireland League.

====Jamaica====
The Jamaican women&#x27;s national soccer team (nicknamed the Reggae Girlz) participated in the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. This was the first Women&#x27;s World Cup the country had qualified for, and the country was also the first Caribbean country to ever qualify. However, in September 2019, members of the team, including Khadija Shaw and Allyson Swaby, posted a graphic on Instagram with captions stating that they had not been paid by the Jamaica Football Federation (JFF) for nine months of work. They announced that the team would not participate in any future tournaments until they received payment. JFF President Michael Ricketts later announced that the team would be paid by the end of September. In October 2019, the Reggae Girlz began playing again, and they won their group in the Qualification Tournament for the 2020 CONCACAF Women&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Competition.

The Jamaican national netball team (nicknamed the Sunshine Girls) is ranked fourth in the world, as of July 2019. However, the team has not been well-funded, and had to resort to crowdfunding to attend the 2019 Netball World Cup. After receiving support from sponsors, the Sunshine Girls were able to go to the tournament, where they placed fifth overall.

====Muslim world====

Muslim women are less likely to take part in sport than Western non-Muslims. This is particularly so for women in Arab societies. The traditions of Islamic modesty in dress and requirements for women&#x27;s sport to take place in a single-sex environment make sports participation more difficult for devout female adherents. The lack of availability of suitably modest sports clothing and sports facilities that allow women to play in private contributes to the lack of participation. Cultural norms of women&#x27;s roles and responsibilities towards the family may also be a source of discouragement from time-consuming sports practice.

Islamic tenets and religious texts suggest that women&#x27;s sports in general should be promoted and are not against the values of the religion. The Quranic statements that followers of Islam should be healthy, fit and make time for leisure are not sex-specific. Muhammad is said to have raced his wife Aisha on several occasions, with Aisha beating him the first couple of times. Correspondingly, some scholars have proposed that Muslim women&#x27;s lack of engagement with sport is due to cultural or societal reasons, rather than strictly religious ones.

However, besides religious testaments, there are many barriers for Muslim women in relation to sports participation. A significant barrier to Muslim women&#x27;s sports participation is bans on the Islamic headscarf, commonly known as the hijab. FIFA instituted such a ban in 2011, preventing the Iranian women&#x27;s national football team from competing. They have since repealed the ban, but other organizations, including FIBA, maintain such regulations. At the same time, many Muslim female athletes have achieved significant success in athletic competitions. Some have also used sports towards their own empowerment, working for women&#x27;s rights, education, and health and wellbeing.

Iranian women were banned from attending a volleyball game and an Iranian girl was arrested for attending a match. Iran was given the right to host the International Beach Volleyball tournament, and many Iranian women were looking forward to attending the event. However, when the women tried to attend the event, they were disallowed, and told it was forbidden to attend by the FIVB. The women took to social media to share their outrage; however the Federation of International Beach volleyball refuted the accusations, saying it was a misunderstanding. This is one of the instances of unfair treatment of women, trying to participate in supporting their teams in Iran.

In October 2018 Iran announced that, after 40 years, it would allow women to enter sport arenas. On September 22, 2019, the Iranian authorities assured FIFA that women would be able to attend the October qualifier of 2022 World Cup in Tehran, stated Gianni Infantino.

====Nigeria====
In 2016, the Nigerian women&#x27;s national soccer team, known as the Super Falcons, won the 2016 Africa Women Cup of Nations. The players alleged that they had not received their earned bonuses from winning the tournament owed to them by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). The NFF promised that it would pay them, but said the &quot;money [was] not readily available at the moment.&quot; In response, players engaged in a sit-in at their hotel as well as publicly demonstrated outside Nigeria&#x27;s National Assembly.

In 2019, the Super Falcons participated in the 2019 Women&#x27;s World Cup and were eliminated from the tournament in the Round of 16. Following their elimination, the players engaged in another sit-in at their hotel, refusing to leave Paris until the NFF paid them the bonuses and daily allowances they had earned both from the World Cup as well as from other matches played in 2016 and 2017.

====Norway====

Norwegian sports are shaped by the values associated with them. For example, aggression generally is associated with males and being personable, with females. However, in terms of Norwegian handball, a study done by the Norwegian School of Sports and Sciences shows that gender is disregarded when the sport is covered in the media. The same study revealed that Women&#x27;s handball is covered and followed as equally if not more than the men&#x27;s team. In contrast to international handball coverage, the Norwegian coverage of Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s handball are discussed in the media using the same or similar verbiage. While they are especially noticeable in handball, equality and opportunity in Norwegian sports is not limited to the handball. Many top-female athletes from a number of sports have come from Norway. The act of playing or coaching were described slightly differently but categorized as successful using similar terms despite the gender of the coach or the player.

Ada Hegerberg is a highly skilled and decorated Norwegian soccer player, having won numerous Champions League and Division 1 Féminine titles with French club Olympique Lyonnais. She also won the first-ever women&#x27;s Ballon D&#x27;Or, a prestigious award given to the best soccer player in the world. However, in 2017, she stopped playing with the Norwegian national team, citing unequal pay and conditions between the women&#x27;s team and the men&#x27;s team as her reason for stepping away from the team. She said she would no longer play for the national team until she felt that it was more respected by the Norwegian Football Federation and the culture surrounding women&#x27;s soccer had improved, which meant she did not participate in the high-profile 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

====Philippines====
The Magna Carta for Women in the Philippines (Republic Act No. 9710.) mandates equal participation of women in sports among other non-sports related provisions.

In the Philippines, basketball which is often referred to as the country&#x27;s most popular sport is male-dominated although there are efforts to promote the sport to Filipino women. In 2020, the Women&#x27;s National Basketball League became the country&#x27;s first professional women&#x27;s basketball league.

Prior attempts to provide female players to play competitive basketball included the semi-professional Women&#x27;s Philippine Basketball League which ran from 1998 to 1999, and in 2008. In 3x3 basketball, the men&#x27;s professional league the Philippine Basketball Association, organized the short-lived PBA Women&#x27;s 3x3 which was controversial for its haircut rules which barred women from sporting a &quot;boy&#x27;s cut&quot;.

====South Africa====
Between 2004 and 2008, the previously highly successful South African women&#x27;s national soccer team, known as Banyana Banyana, began to struggle on the field due to a lack of a permanent coach. Members of the South African Football Association (SAFA) attributed the declining quality of play to the players&#x27; &quot;lack of femininity&quot; (Engh 2010), and the players were instructed to take etiquette classes and maintain stereotypical feminine hairstyles, as well as wear more feminine uniforms while playing. In response, players threatened to strike unless they were able to return to their preferred styles of dress.

In 2018, Banyana Banyana was not paid the agreed-upon amount owed to them after qualifying for the 2018 Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON), and they protested by not returning their official national team uniforms. In January 2019, the team was again not paid their stipends and bonuses, despite finishing in second place at AWCON. They threatened to strike by not attending interviews or team practices, as well as not playing in a game against the Dutch national team. However, in May 2019, it was announced that Banyana Banyana would receive equal pay with the men&#x27;s team heading into the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

====Sweden====

In Sweden, public funds are mostly given to men&#x27;s hockey and football, and the women&#x27;s team are left without proper funding. In 2016, Al Jazeera published an article bringing the discrimination that female Swedish athletes face to light by mentioning the double standard put on female athletes in terms of having to work double and still not receive the recognition or pay of the men&#x27;s teams. Sweden is recognized as being a feminist country; however, the wage gap is significant between male and female athletes. In 2013, Swedish striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned $16.7 million a year playing for Paris Saint-German, whereas Lotta Schellin who played for Lyon in France only earned $239,720. The wage gap is also evident among coaches. The difference in pay is evident in how male athletes and female athletes are able to spend their time between games. Women often have to work between training and games to make a living and to pay for their training camps, whereas men have that time to recuperate and relax; men also do not pay to attend training camps.

In August 2019, the Swedish women&#x27;s national ice hockey team boycotted the team&#x27;s training camp and the Five Nations Tournament. In a movement they called #FörFramtiden (in English, &quot;For the Future&quot;), all 43 players invited to camp cited lack of equal pay as well as various instances of poor treatment by Svenska Ishockeyförbundet (the Swedish Ice Hockey Association, or SIF) toward the national team, including, but not limited to:
* Team travel conditions – traveling by ferry instead of by plane to games; arriving to games one day before a tournament began, without accounting for time differences and jet lag
* Team uniforms – players are provided men&#x27;s clothing by SIF, not women&#x27;s clothing
* Nutrition – players are provided expired products
* Lack of development – players allege that SIF has not adequately created a program to foster development of women&#x27;s hockey at the youth level

The Four Nations Cup, originally scheduled for November 2019, was canceled by SIF due to the players&#x27; dispute with the federation.

Following the boycott, it was announced in October 2019 that the players had reached a new agreement with the federation, and that the team will begin training in November 2019 and play in a tournament against Switzerland, Finland, and Germany in December 2019. The new deal includes terms guaranteeing performance-based bonuses and additional compensation.

====United States====

Women make up 54% of enrollment at 832 schools that responded to an NCAA gender equity study in 2000; however, females at these institutions only account for 41% of the athletes. Before Title IX, 90% of women&#x27;s college athletic programs were run by women, but by 1992 the number dropped to 42% since Title IX requires that there are equal opportunities for both genders. Many of the issues today often revolve around the amount of money going into women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sports. According to 2000–2001 figures, men&#x27;s college programs still have many advantages over women&#x27;s in the average number of scholarships (60.5%), operating expenses (64.5%), recruiting expenses (68.2%) and head coaching salaries (59.5%). Other forms of inequality are in the coaching positions. Before Title IX, women coached 90% of women&#x27;s teams; in 1978 that percentage dropped to 58, and in 2004 it dropped even more to 44 percent. In 1972, women administered 90 percent of women&#x27;s athletic programs, and in 2004 this fell to 19 percent. Also in 2004, 18 percent of all women&#x27;s programs had no women administrators. In 2004, there were 3,356 administrative jobs in NCAA women&#x27;s athletic programs and of those jobs, women held 35 percent of them.

The fight for equality extends to the wallet. On March 30, 2016, five players from the U.S. women&#x27;s soccer team filed a federal complaint of wage discrimination against U.S. Soccer, the governing body that pays both the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s team. The complaint argues that U.S. Soccer pays players on the women&#x27;s team as little as forty percent of what it pays players on the men&#x27;s team. This pay discrepancy exists despite the fact that the women&#x27;s team has been much more successful in international competitions; the women&#x27;s team has won four Olympic gold medals and three of the last five Women&#x27;s World Cups, while the men&#x27;s team has never won either of these competitions. This case was largely dismissed with the judge noting that the women&#x27;s team had been offered and rejected the same pay structure as the men&#x27;s team.

==World conferences==
In 1994, the International Working Group on Women and Sport (IWG) organized the first World Conference on Women and Sport in Brighton, United Kingdom, where the Brighton Declaration was published. The IWG hosted further world conferences every four years, with the result of the Windfoek Call for Action (1998), Montreal Tool Kit (2002) and Brighton Plus Helsinki 2014 Declaration (2014). The conferences aim to &quot;develop a sporting culture that enables and values the full involvement of women in every aspect of sport and physical activity&quot;, by &quot;increasing the involvement of women in sport at all levels and in all functions and roles&quot;.

The next IWG Women &amp; Sport Global Summit will be held on the 9–11 July 2026, in Birmingham, UK. Organization focused on promoting gender equity in sport and physical activity. The IWG holds a global summit known as the IWG World Conference on Women &amp; Sport, which brings together leaders, advocates, athletes, and stakeholders from around the world to discuss and advance gender equality in sports.

These global summits are significant events where participants share best practices, research findings, and strategies to empower women and girls in sports, address barriers they face, and promote their participation and leadership in all aspects of sport. The IWG World Conference on Women &amp; Sport plays a crucial role in shaping policies, initiatives, and collaborations aimed at achieving gender equity in the sports industry worldwide.

== Media coverage ==
Media coverage for women&#x27;s sports is significantly less than the coverage for men&#x27;s sports. Substantial research indicates that women&#x27;s sports and female athletes gain only a small fraction of sports media coverage worldwide. Research that has examined why this is the case suggested this can be attributed to three particular factors that govern sports newswork: the male-dominated sports newsroom, ingrained assumptions about readership, and the systematic, repetitive nature of sports news. In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sports on popular sports commentary shows. Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories. After recording sports news and highlights, they wrote a quantitative description of what they saw and a qualitative description of the amount of time that story received.

For three decades, it has been commonly believed that women&#x27;s sports receive significantly less media coverage compared to men&#x27;s sports, with historical estimates ranging from 3% to 5.5% of total sports coverage. In 2022, despite 70% of people watching women&#x27;s sports, only 16% of sports media coverage was dedicated to these events. To better understand the media presence of women&#x27;s sports, Wasserman&#x27;s Collective and Global Insights Team, in partnership with ESPN Research, analyzed data from 2018 to 2022, including coverage from 100 linear TV networks, major streaming services, prominent sports media social accounts, and various digital publications. This analysis aimed to provide a more accurate picture of the media environment for women&#x27;s sports in the U.S., focusing on broad sports coverage outlets and excluding those that might skew coverage toward specific sports.

===Feminist patriarchal theory===

More often than not, modern research in regards to media and women&#x27;s sport is focused on comparing women&#x27;s sport with men&#x27;s sport. Gender feminists in particular consider the lower levels of media representation in women&#x27;s sport cause for alarm though this view is not shared among all women in sport, with some circles concerned more about increasing female participation itself. While one group maintains that these two factors, participation and media exposure, are inextricably linked, others disagree with this view and do not consider a media agenda or goal to be of importance.

Modern research involving the feminist theory of patriarchy aimed at determining the cause of a perceived lack of media representation is based predominantly upon two driving assumptions: the theory of patriarchy as fact in every case, and the belief that participation in sport by females should also serve a type of feminist agenda in order to be valid.

====Recent work====

In America, recent work attributed this perceived lack of representation in women&#x27;s sport to three particular factors that govern sports newswork: the &quot;male-dominated sports newsroom&quot;, &quot;ingrained assumptions about readership&quot;, and the &quot;systematic, repetitive nature of sports news&quot;.

In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sports on popular sports commentary shows. Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories. After recording sports news and highlights, they wrote a quantitative description of what they saw and a qualitative description of the amount of time that story received.

During that first year that the research was conducted in 1989, it was recorded that 5% of the sports segments were based on women&#x27;s sports, compared to the 92% that were based on men&#x27;s sports and the 3% that was a combination of both. In the late 1900s Women&#x27;s Sports started to gain popularity in the media because of their talent in the Olympics. In 1999, women&#x27;s sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women&#x27;s sports were reported in the news ticker, the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women&#x27;s sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men&#x27;s sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.
When researching the actual amount of time that women&#x27;s sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. A recent study showed that in July, -The NBA summer league receives more coverage and attention than a regular season game in the WNBA. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well. The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men&#x27;s cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women&#x27;s cricket team, who also had won more games than the men&#x27;s rugby team. In 2009, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; broadcast segments called &quot;Her Story&quot;, which was a commentary that highlighted women&#x27;s athletic careers.
In newspapers articles, coverage on men&#x27;s sports once again had a greater number of articles than women&#x27;s sports in a ratio of 23–1. In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women&#x27;s sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women&#x27;s sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men&#x27;s coverage. The lengths of these articles were 25–27% shorter than the length of men&#x27;s articles. There was an international frenzy in 2012 when the first woman that represented Saudi Arabia in the 2012 Olympics competed in track. That was the most women&#x27;s sports coverage that there had been in several years. Women played 90 minutes of football, 80 minutes of rugby, 18 holes of golf and ran the same distance in a marathon as men. Exactly 12 months later, the newspapers returned to featuring 4% of articles on women&#x27;s sports. This same trend can be seen with regards to the FIFA World Cup. The 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup Final had an average of 25.4 million American viewers throughout the duration of the match, and peaked at 30.9 million viewers. It was the most-viewed game of soccer ever in the United States–men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s–by a margin of almost 7 million viewers. Despite this jump in viewership of women&#x27;s soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women&#x27;s professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men&#x27;s league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons. The dearth of coverage of women&#x27;s sports is evidenced by the low number of segments (i.e., stories) in our sample. Of the 934 local network affiliate news segments (over 12 hr of broadcasts), 880 were on men&#x27;s sports (or approximately 11½ hr), 22 segments (or nearly 18 min) were on gender-neutral sports (e.g., a horse race, coverage of the Los Angeles [LA] marathon, and a recreational sports event), and only 32 segments (about 23 min) featured women&#x27;s sports. SportsCenter&#x27;s numbers were similar. Of the 405 total SportsCenter segments in our sample (nearly 14 hr), 376 covered men&#x27;s sports (slightly over 13 hr), 16 segments were on gender-neutral sports (just over 20 min), and only 13 segments featured women&#x27;s sports (approximately 17 min).
A recent article from the Wall Street Journal states &quot;from 2016 to 2018, women&#x27;s games generated about $50.8 million in revenue compared with $49.9 million for the men, according to U.S. soccer&#x27;s audited financial statements&quot; (Bachman, 2019). These numbers contrasts the idea that women&#x27;s sports are not entertaining enough for the viewer or typical fan by $1.9 million. This idea stems from the male dominated sports perspective, which constantly undermines the perception of quality, effort, and potential that women&#x27;s soccer exhibits. However, we can see through the caliber of women&#x27;s soccer displayed most recently within the Women&#x27;s FIFA World Cup of 2019 that it was on par if not better than the level of play of their male counterparts. The U.S. Women&#x27;s National Team scored 13 goals against Thailand in their opening match, the most goals scored in any World Cup match in history. Media outlets though may remain concerned that increased coverage of women&#x27;s sport will lead to a reduction in audience draw and advertising revenue.
Amy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain&#x27;s newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men&#x27;s sports and women&#x27;s sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. &quot;Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females.&quot; She also documented how women&#x27;s bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. &quot;The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen&#x27;s achievements.&quot; The media has the ability to create or prevent interest in women&#x27;s sports. Excluding women&#x27;s sports from the media makes it much less likely for young girls to have role models that are women athletes. According to Tucker Center for Research on Girls &amp; Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota 40% of all athletes in the United States are women but women&#x27;s sports only receive about 4% of sports media coverage. This amount of coverage has decreased in the last 20 years although there has been a major increase in women athletes.
Media coverage has slightly increased and this is mostly due to social networking. Social media has further exposed women sports out to the public world, and often at a much greater rate than traditional news media. Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women&#x27;s sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved. However, mainstream media still is far behind in its showcasing of female sports in comparison to that of men&#x27;s. A study has shown that ESPN, which began airing women NCAA tournament in 2003, aired eleven women tournament segments in comparison to one-hundred men&#x27;s tournament segments. ESPN and other sports outlets are airing more female-oriented sporting events; however the length of the segments are very small. This representative data is showcases a main part of the minimal interaction the media has with women athletes. Media coverage of women sports in the United States has further justified the divisional hierarchy faced by women athletes in terms of popularity and coverage. Scholarly studies (Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013) also show that when women athletes were given the option to pick a photo of a picture that would increase respect for their sport, they picked an on-the-court competency picture. However, when women athletes were told to pick a picture that would increase interest in their sport, 47% picked a picture that sexualized the women athlete. The UK is more representative than the United States with the BBC giving women&#x27;s sports about 20% of their sports coverage (BBC spokesperson). Many women athletes in the UK do not see this as adequate coverage for the 36% of women who participate in sports. NewsChain is the first commercial publisher totally dedicated to women&#x27;s sport coverage based in the UK.

It is shown that only 5 percent of sports coverage on &quot;Sports Center&quot; is of women sport.

== Sports equipment for girls and women ==
Sports equipment designed for the female body is a more recent development in women&#x27;s and girl&#x27;s sport. Historically, men&#x27;s organized sport develops first, often leaving girls and women with the only option of using equipment originally designed for the male body, a common practice to this day. Over time these practices have revealed sports equipment can present design issues for female participants, particularly for those whose participation continues after the onset of puberty. Typically, anatomical differences between male and female bodies do not receive first consideration during the first stage of equipment design since the male body often serves as the base model due to the predominance of male participants and market demand. Women and girls will often use equipment designed for smaller men, or even boys. In some sports these differences are not adversely significant, but can be so in the case of others. Sports equipment can create sizing issues for girls and women and can also affect performance, enjoyment and satisfaction. Designers can also fail to develop equipment made to protective sensitive areas such as female genitalia and the chest area.

=== Sports bra ===
One important recent development is the sports bra. Commercially available sports bras first came to market in the 1970s. The development of sports bra significantly improves the performance of women in sports activities and offers several benefits that contribute to a more comfortable and efficient sports experience for women. By the research of Norris etal, breast movements show a noticeable drop when women engage in sports activities wearing sports bra and a more stable body contributes to better performance in sports. Sports bra address the physical needs and promote body acceptance of women by providing support, compression, and encapsulation, which allows women to exercise comfortably and safely and symbols women&#x27;s participation in sports and their right to engage in physical activity without limitations. This can challenge traditional gender stereotypes and contribute to a more inclusive and equitable sporting landscape.

===Female genital protection===
Some sports require female players wear a type of female genital protection. The female equivalent of the male jockstrap is the pelvic protector, essentially a jockstrap for females, known colloquially called a &quot;jill&quot; or &quot;jillstrap&quot;.

== Sex-specific sports injuries ==
There are some common sports injuries for which female athletes may be at a higher risk than male athletes.

=== Female Athlete Triad (RED-S) ===

One area of interest involves studying the female athlete triad, &quot;Relative energy deficiency in sport&quot;, (RED-S).

=== Knee injuries ===

Several studies have shown that female athletes are more likely to tear their anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) than male athletes. According to William Levine, director of sports medicine at Columbia University and the head physician for its varsity teams, female athletes are four or five times more likely than male athletes to have ACL tears.

There are several different theories about why women are more prone to this injury, including the &quot;Q theory&quot; which highlights specific differences in male and female anatomy and kinesiology. The difference in injury risk may be due to female-specific hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle, or due to different skeletal and muscular structures (like a wider pelvis, stronger quadriceps than hamstrings, or more elastic ligaments) that cause women to place more stress on and more easily stretch the ACL than men.

=== Concussions ===
Female athletes are also more prone to concussions than male athletes. They exhibit more visible symptoms of a concussion than male athletes and for a longer period of time than male athletes, a phenomenon known as the &quot;concussion gap&quot;. However, there is no consensus on the reason women are more prone to concussions than men or experience symptoms differently. Some theories have been that women have smaller, more breakable nerve fibers in their brains, that their necks are weaker and so their brains accelerate more sharply on impact, or fluctuating hormones during menstrual cycles that make them more susceptible.

<doc id="265902" wikidata="Q208157" url="?curid=265902" title="Straits of Tiran">
<text>The Straits of Tiran ( &quot;&quot;) are the narrow sea passages between the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas that connect the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea. The distance between the two peninsulas is about . The Multinational Force and Observers monitors the compliance of Egypt in maintaining freedom of navigation of the straits, as provided under the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. 

The body is named after Tiran Island, located at its entrance from the Sinai. Sanafir Island lies to the east of Tiran, southeast of the shallow strait between Tiran and Saudi Arabia.

The straits give access to Eilat, a port on the southeast tip of Israel. The blockade of Israeli passage through the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran led to two wars, in 1956 and 1967.

== Background ==

International documents inconsistently refer to both the &quot;Straits of Tiran&quot; and the &quot;Strait of Tiran&quot;. There are several passages formed by the islands between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The westernmost strait, between Egypt and the island of Tiran, overlooked by the Egyptian city Sharm El Sheikh, is the &quot;Strait of Tiran&quot;, wide. It has two passages deep enough to be navigable by large ships. The Enterprise passage, deep, is adjacent to the Egyptian side, while the -deep Grafton passage, surrounded by shallows, is to the east, nearer to the island of Tiran. To the east of Tiran, between it and Saudi Arabia, the other strait has reefs and shallows with a single channel deep.

== Closures in 1948–1956 and 1967 ==

Access to Jordan&#x27;s only seaport of Aqaba and to Israel&#x27;s only Red Sea seaport of Eilat is through the Gulf of Aqaba, which gives the Straits of Tiran strategic importance. In 1967, 90% of Israeli oil passed through the Straits of Tiran, making it a target of Egyptian blockade during the Arab League boycott of Israel. 

In May 1967, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol repeated declarations that Israel had made in 1957, saying that closure of the Straits of Tiran would be an act of war. Egypt then blockaded the straits on May 22, 1967, and oil tankers that were due to pass through the straits were required to submit documents ensuring their cargo was not destined for an Israeli port. At that time, Israel viewed the Straits of Tiran as a vital interest as it is where Israel received vital imports, mainly oil from Iran, and a blockade threatened Israel&#x27;s ability to develop the Negev.

In May 1967, Major-General Indar Jit Rikhye was the Commander of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in the Sinai Peninsula when Egypt deployed its own troops in that territory and demanded that Rikhye withdraw all of his troops. Rikhye did withdraw, including from the port at Sharm El Sheikh adjacent to the straits. The subsequent closure of the Tiran Straits by Egypt was closely linked to the preceding UNEF withdrawal, because having the peacekeepers (rather than the Egyptian military) at Sharm El Sheikh was important for keeping that waterway open. Later in life, General Rikhye sought to downplay the importance that Israel attached to keeping that waterway open, saying that Israel&#x27;s accusation in 1967 of a blockade was &quot;questionable&quot; given that an Israeli-flagged ship had not passed through the straits in two years, and that &quot;The U.A.R. [Egyptian] navy had searched a couple of ships after the establishment of the blockade and thereafter relaxed its implementation&quot;. Egypt had initially requested UNEF withdrawal from locations other than Sharm El Sheikh, but UN Secretary-General U Thant demanded an all-or-nothing withdrawal.

The US president at the time, Lyndon Johnson, said the following about closure of these straits being a cause of the Six-Day War:

&quot;If a single act of folly was more responsible for this explosion than any other, it was the arbitrary and dangerous announced decision that the Straits of Tiran would be closed. The right of innocent, maritime passage must be preserved for all nations.&quot;

== Bridge project ==
The Saudi–Egypt Causeway, a proposed project to build a bridge across the straits, linking Egypt and Saudi Arabia, is under consideration by the Egyptian Government.

<text>1. Fußball-Club Kaiserslautern e. V., also known as 1. FCK, FCK (), FC Kaiserslautern (), K&#x27;lautern or colloquially Lautern (), is a German sports club based in Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatinate. In addition to football, the club also operates in several other sports.

On 2 June 1900, Germania 1896 and FG Kaiserslautern merged to create FC 1900. In 1909, the club went on to join FC Palatia (founded in 1901) and FC Bavaria (founded in 1902) to form FV 1900 Kaiserslautern. In 1929, they merged with SV Phönix to become FV Phönix-Kaiserslautern, before finally taking on their current name in 1933.

As a founding member of the Bundesliga, FCK played from 1963 to 1996 uninterrupted in the top division. They have won four German championships, two DFB-Pokals, and one DFL-Supercup, and rank among the most successful football clubs in Germany, currently occupying eleventh place in the all-time Bundesliga table. The club&#x27;s international performances include reaching the Champions League quarter-finals in 1999, as well as playing in the UEFA Cup semi-finals twice. Their first league title in the Bundesliga era was won in 1991. Kaiserslautern then won the German championship in the 1997–98 season, becoming the only team ever to win as a newly promoted team. After a six-year spell in the second tier, in 2018 they were relegated to the 3. Liga for the first time. In 2022, Kaiserslautern was promoted again to the 2. Bundesliga after winning the promotion playoff match.

Since 1920, Kaiserslautern&#x27;s stadium has been the Fritz-Walter-Stadion, named in 1985 after Fritz Walter, the captain of the West Germany national team who won the World Cup in 1954. Walter spent his entire career at Kaiserslautern.

==History==
===Early years through World War II===
Two of the club&#x27;s predecessors, Bavaria and FC 1900 Kaiserslautern, were part of the Westkreis-Liga (I) when this league was formed in 1908, with the latter winning the first league. The new FV Kaiserslautern finished as runners-up in the league in 1910 and 1912. The team reached tier one in the new Kreisliga Saar in 1919, the Kreisliga Pfalz in 1920 and the Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar in 1931. Throughout the 1930s, they spent time in both the Bezirksliga and the upper level Gauliga Südwest, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under Nazi Germany.

The club&#x27;s performance improved after 1939, winning the Gauliga Südwest/Staffel Saarpfalz title, but losing the overall division title to Staffel Mainhessen winners Kickers Offenbach. In the 1941–42 season the Gauliga Südwest was split into the Gauliga Hessen-Nassau and the Gauliga Westmark, and Kaiserslautern took the Westmark title, going on to play for the first time in the national final rounds. They were knocked out 3–9 by eventual champions Schalke 04.

The team finished last in their division in 1944. The following year saw the collapse of league play due to the effects of the Second World War.

===Postwar play===
After the war, southwestern Germany was part of the occupation zone held by the French. Teams there were organized into northern and southern divisions, and played to determine which of them would join the new Oberliga. French authorities were slow to loosen their control over play in their zones of occupation, and, in the Saarland in particular, teams in the French areas took longer to join the re-established Germany national league than in other parts of the country. 1. FC Kaiserslautern resumed play in the Oberliga Südwest in 1945, and finished the season just one point behind 1. FC Saarbrücken. The next season, they won the Gruppe Nord in 1947. FCK&#x27;s Fritz and Ottmar Walter scored 46 goals between them, more than any other entire team.

===Success in the 1950s and entry to the Bundesliga===
This marked the beginning of the club&#x27;s dominance of the Oberliga Südwest as they went on to win the division title eleven times over the next twelve seasons. FCK advanced to Germany&#x27;s first post-war national final in 1948, but lost 1–2 to 1. FC Nürnberg.

Kaiserslautern became a presence on the national scene through the early 1950s, winning their first German championship in 1951 with a 2–1 victory of their own, this time over Preußen Münster. They won a second title in 1953, followed by two losing final appearances in 1954 and 1955. The club also sent five players to the national side for the 1954 FIFA World Cup, which West Germany won in a final sometimes referred to as The Miracle of Bern.

Kaiserslautern lost 0–2 to Werder Bremen in the 1961 DFB-Pokal final. The side recovered its form in time to again win their division on the eve of the formation in 1963 of the Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s new professional football league. This secured them one of the 16 places in the new top flight circuit. They were German Cup runners-up in 1972, 1976, and 1981, and were UEFA Cup semi-finalists in 1982 (losing narrowly to eventual winners IFK Göteborg). The club finally won the domestic Cup in 1990, and followed up this achievement the following season with their first Bundesliga championship. Both times the manager was Karl-Heinz Feldkamp.

===1996–2004===
1. FCK won a second German Cup in 1996, but were relegated to 2. Bundesliga with a 16th-place finish just one week before the Cup final. At the time, Kaiserslautern was one of only four of the original 16 teams that had played in each Bundesliga season since the inception of the league, having never been relegated. This group also included Eintracht Frankfurt (who went down in the same season), 1. FC Köln (down in 1998), and &quot;the Dinosaur&quot;, Hamburger SV, whose spell ended in 2018.

FCK won promotion from the 2. Bundesliga at the first attempt in 1997, and immediately went on to win the national championship under veteran coach Otto Rehhagel. They also played in the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, where they topped a group comprising PSV, Benfica and HJK Helsinki, but were eliminated in the quarter-finals by compatriots Bayern Munich, who also took back the domestic title (FCK finished 5th).

Despite coming close to a UEFA Cup final in 2001, Kaiserslautern was close to bankruptcy, and at the centre of a public controversy. The club&#x27;s management – Jürgen Friedrich, Robert Wieschemann and Gerhard Herzog – were forced out. A new team president, Rene C. Jäggi, sold the Fritz-Walter-Stadion to an entity owned by the Land Rheinland-Pfalz and the city of Kaiserslautern, while a new coach, Erik Gerets, led the team out of last place and saved them from relegation.

At the start of the 2003–04 season, the club received a three-point penalty imposed by the German Football Association for financial misconduct. Gerets was fired and replaced by Kurt Jara. Jara was unpopular with the FCK faithful for his defensive football philosophy. Jara quit the position before the season ended, citing irreconcilable differences with club management.

===2005–present===
In 2005, Michael Henke, who had served as long-time assistant to Ottmar Hitzfeld, became coach. FCK was initially successful, but later returned to bottom of the table. Henke was fired, and FCK alumnus Wolfgang Wolf took up the trainer&#x27;s role. Wolf brought in many young, home-grown players, but at the end of the 2005–06 season, FCK were once again relegated to the 2. Bundesliga after a nine-year stay in the top flight. They finished the 2006–07 season in sixth place in the 2. Bundesliga, seven points out of the promotion places.

On 20 May 2007, the club announced the Norwegian manager Kjetil Rekdal, formerly with Belgian side Lierse, as their new head coach. Rekdal took over on 1 July. After only three wins in 19 games, the club was in 16th place and Rekdal was sacked and replaced by Milan Šašić in February 2008. In April 2008, the club hired Stefan Kuntz as chairman, and with new leadership they saved themselves from relegation to the new 3. Liga with a win over already promoted 1. FC Köln on the final day of the 2007–08 season.
Šašić lasted almost the entire 2008–09 season, but was dismissed on 4 May 2009 after a run of poor results in the second half of the season, and three days after a 1–5 defeat by Hansa Rostock. Alois Schwartz was named interim coach, and he managed the club to a seventh-place finish on the season. The club eventually hired Marco Kurz as head coach.

Under Kurz, the club secured promotion to the 1. Bundesliga on 25 April 2010, after four years in the second league. At the start of the 2010–11 season, newly promoted 1. FCK had a promising two-straight wins, including a 2–0 victory over the previous year&#x27;s Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich. However, after a 2–1 defeat at Mainz 05 and a 5–0 drubbing at eventual season champions Borussia Dortmund, the club began to struggle, and fell back to just ahead of the relegation zone. The club then had a poor start to the second half of the season – dropping into the relegation zone for several weeks – but managed to rally, earning seven victories in their last ten matches. They ended this run with four straight victories to finish the season at the seventh place.

The following season, 2011–12, the club finished in the bottom 18th place, and after two seasons in the top flight, were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. They remained in that division until 2018, being relegated to the third tier for the first time in club history.

In March 2022, a U.S. consortium consisting of Paul Conway, Chien Lee, Michael Kalt, Krishen Sud and Randy Frankel bought 10% of the club.

On 24 May 2022, four years after their first relegation into Germany&#x27;s third division, Kaiserslautern were promoted back to the 2. Bundesliga.
In the 2023-24 season, Kaiserslauten made a surprising DFB-Pokal run, winning against fourth division side FC Rot-Weiß Koblenz, Bundesliga side 1. FC Köln, second division side 1. FC Nürnberg and third division side 1. FC Saarbrücken to reach the DFB-Pokal final, the first in 21 years where they narrowly lost 1-0 to the reigning Bundesliga champion Bayer 04 Leverkusen.

==Reserve team==
The club&#x27;s reserve team, 1. FC Kaiserslautern II, played as 1. FC Kaiserslautern Amateure until 2005. It made a first appearance in the tier three Amateurliga Südwest in 1957. It won a league championship in 1960 and 1968 but was not entitled to promotion to professional level. In 1978, when the Oberliga Südwest was introduced the team qualified for this new league which it would belong to, with the exception of the 1982–83 season, until 1992. It won promotion back to the Oberliga in 1994 and became a yo-yo team between this league and the Regionalliga above, a league newly introduced in 1994. The team was relegated from the latter in 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2007 but each time won promotion back to the league. Between 2012 and 2017, the club played in the Regionalliga Südwest.

The team has also won the Southwestern Cup on three occasions, in 1979, 1997 and 2008. Through this competition, 1. FC Kaiserslautern II qualified for the DFB-Pokal on three occasions, reaching the second round twice and being drawn against their own first team in 1997–98 where they lost 5–0.

==Stadium==

FCK plays its home fixtures in the Fritz-Walter-Stadion first built in 1920. In 1985 the stadium and the adjacent street were named for the player who brought the club to prominence after World War II. The facility is built on the Betzenberg, literally &quot;Mount Betze&quot;, a steep sandstone hill.

The stadium has a capacity of 49,327 and was a venue at the 2006 World Cup, hosting four preliminary round and one group of 16-round matches. The facility underwent a major refurbishment for the tournament with addition of new grandstands and a roof.

==Club culture==
Kaiserslautern&#x27;s Fritz-Walter-Stadion has long been a feared away venue given the rabid ferocity of Kaiserslautern fans: the most faithful of these supporters are located in the stadium&#x27;s &quot;Westkurve&quot; (Westside, literally &quot;West Curve&quot;, since the stands used to be shaped in a semicircle behind the goals). Most famously, Bayern Munich once lost a match here in a charged atmosphere by a score of 7–4 after leading 4–1 at the 58th minute.

The club has friendly ties to FC Metz, 1860 Munich, VfB Stuttgart, Werder Bremen and Kilmarnock F.C. of Scotland and are bitter rivals of Waldhof Mannheim and Bayern Munich. They also have lesser local rivalries with Eintracht Frankfurt and, more recently, with Mainz 05 and Karlsruher SC.

===Boxing===
The boxing department exists since the times of FV Kaiserslautern. Most prominent athletes are Silver medalist of the 1964 Summer Olympics Emil Schulz, Bronze medalist of the 1988 Summer Olympics Reiner Gies and, before his professional career, later European heavyweight champion Karl Mildenberger.

===Former departments===
====Wheelchair basketball====
The wheelchair basketball team FCK Rolling Devils was founded in 2009 as a part of the club&#x27;s basketball department and turned into a separate department in 2013. Since 2014, the Rolling Devils play in the 1st German Wheelchair Basketball Federal League. In July 2015, the outsourcing of Rolling Devils into an independent club with 1.FC Kaiserslautern as name sponsor took place and the FCK department was suspended at the annual meeting of 1.FC Kaiserslautern in December 2015.

<text>The Mannerheim family (originally Marhein) also spelled von Mannerheim is the name of a prominent noble family of German origin, which was part of Finnish, Swedish, and German nobility.

==Lineage==
===Baronial lineage===
(number 18 in the register of the Finnish House of Nobility)

The family descends from a German businessman and mill owner, Henrik Marhein (1618–1667), who emigrated to Gävle, Sweden. His son, Augustin Marhein, was raised to the nobility in Sweden in 1693. He was introduced to the Riddarhuset as a member of the Untitled Nobility (&quot;adliga ätter&quot;), being introduced under number 1260, and with the surname Mannerheim. His son, an artillery colonel and a mill supervisor, Johan Augustin Mannerheim (1706–1778), was raised to the rank of Baron at the same time with his brother in 1768. Johan Augustin was introduced in 1776 under number 277. His son Baron Carl Erik Mannerheim came to Finland in the latter part of 18th century and the family was immatriculated in Finland in 1818.

===Comital lineage===
(number 8 in the register of the Finnish House of Nobility)

Baron Carl Erik Mannerheim (1759–1837) was the son of Baron Johan Augustin Mannerheim. Born in Säter, Carl Erik was part of the Anjala League, an opposition movement during the reign of Gustav III of Sweden. However, he received an amnesty and emigrated to Finland, where he purchased Louhisaari manor in 1795. In 1805, he was elected Chairman of the Finnish Economic Society. At the beginning of Russian rule in Finland, he was chairman of the delegation accounting for matters in Finland to Tsar Alexander I.

He served as Vice-President of the Senate of Finland&#x27;s Economic Department (i.e., &quot;de facto&quot; head of government), and Governor of Turku and Pori provinces. He was also first Major of the Åbo province infantry regiment. He was given the hereditary title of Count (in Finnish &quot;Kreivi&quot;, in Swedish &quot;Greve&quot;) in 1824 and introduced in 1825. The title is inherited by the eldest son.

The family was reintroduced in the Swedish nobility in 1947 and 1953.

<text>Saint Louis Cemetery (, ) is the name of three Catholic cemeteries in New Orleans, Louisiana. Most of the graves are above-ground vaults constructed in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Cemeteries No. 1 and No. 2 are included on the National Register of Historic Places and the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail.

==Saint Louis No. 1==
St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is the oldest and among the most prominent cemeteries in New Orleans. It was opened in 1789, replacing the city&#x27;s older St. Peter Cemetery (; no longer in existence) as the main burial ground when the city was redesigned after a fire in 1788.

It is 8 blocks from the Mississippi River, on the north side of Basin Street, one block beyond the inland border of the French Quarter. It borders the former Iberville Projects. It has been in continuous use since its foundation. The nonprofit group Save Our Cemeteries and commercial businesses offer tours for a fee.

Notable New Orleanians buried in St. Louis No. 1 include Etienne de Boré, a wealthy pioneer of the sugar industry and the first mayor of New Orleans; Homer Plessy, the plaintiff from the landmark 1896 &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; Supreme Court decision on civil rights. Ernest N. &quot;Dutch&quot; Morial, the first African-American mayor of New Orleans was interred there in 1989. Subsequently, Morial&#x27;s family built a new family tomb at St. Louis Cemetery No. 3, and Morial&#x27;s body was reinterred there in late 2014. Notable creole author and educator Alexander Dimitry is buried at 
Saint Louis Cemetery Number One. Most of the Dimitry family is interred there including; Andrea Dimitry and his wife Marianne Celeste Dragon. Marianne Céleste Dragon was the subject of a famous portrait painted by José Salazar.

The cemetery inspired an Alkemia Perfumes&#x27; scent of the same name, which is described as &quot;An atmospheric brooding of Spanish moss, crumbling stone, old cement, red clay brick, and graveyard dirt.&quot;

The renowned Voodoo priestess Marie Laveau is believed to be interred in the Glapion family crypt. Other notable New Orleanians here include Bernard de Marigny, the French-Creole aristocrat and politician who founded both the Faubourg Marigny and Mandeville, Louisiana; Barthelemy Lafon, the architect and surveyor who allegedly became one of Jean Lafitte&#x27;s pirates; and Paul Morphy, one of the earliest world champions of chess. Delphine LaLaurie, the notoriously cruel slave owner, is also believed to lie in rest here. Architect and engineer Benjamin Latrobe was buried at St. Louis No. 1 after dying from yellow fever in 1820, while doing engineering for the New Orleans water works. In 2010, actor Nicolas Cage purchased a pyramid-shaped tomb to be his future final resting place.

The cemetery spans just one square block but is the resting place of many thousands. A Protestant section (generally not vaulted) lies in the northwest section.

Effective March 1, 2015, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans, which owns and manages this cemetery, has closed it to the general public, ostensibly because of the rise in vandalism there. However, in a controversial move, the diocese is now charging tour companies for access ($4,500 per year, or lesser amounts for short periods). Families who own tombs can apply for a pass to visit.

==Saint Louis No. 2==

St. Louis No. 2 is located some three blocks back from St. Louis No. 1, bordering Claiborne Avenue. It was consecrated in 1823. A number of notable jazz and rhythm &amp; blues musicians are buried here, including Danny Barker and Ernie K-Doe. Also entombed here is Andre Cailloux (1825–1863), African-American Union hero and martyr of the American Civil War.

The cemetery received minor flooding during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and its tombs seemed virtually untouched by the storm when the water went down, aside from the brownish waterline visible on all structures that were flooded.

There are many notable citizens of 19th and 20th century New Orleans laid to rest here. These include the Venerable Mother Henriette DeLille, who is a candidate for sainthood by the Catholic Church, Rodolphe Desdunes (1849–1928) and Jean Baptiste Dupeire (1795–1874) prominent citizen of New Orleans, among others.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

==Saint Louis No. 3==
St. Louis No. 3 is located approximately away from the French Quarter, some 30 blocks from the Mississippi River, fronting Esplanade Avenue near Bayou St. John. (Coordinates: .) It opened in 1854. The crypts on average are more elaborate than at the other St. Louis cemeteries, including a number of fine 19th century marble tombs. Those entombed include ragtime composer Paul Sarebresole, photographer E. J. Bellocq, and painter Ralston Crawford. Another to be entombed here is Sweet Emma Barrett [1897–1983], a self-taught jazz piano player and singer. New Orleans mayor Ernest N. &quot;Dutch&quot; Morial was reinterred at St. Louis Cemetery No. 3 in a new tomb for the Morial family.

St. Louis No. 3 also includes a Greek Orthodox section. The cemetery was heavily flooded during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but its tombs escaped relatively unscathed. There was some plaster damage from debris.

<doc id="265912" wikidata="Q1757677" url="?curid=265912" title="The Beautiful South">
<text>The Beautiful South were an English pop rock group formed in 1988 by Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway, two former members of the Hull group the Housemartins, both of whom performed lead and backing vocals. Other members staying throughout the band&#x27;s existence were former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch (bass), Dave Stead (drums), and Dave Rotheray (guitar). The band&#x27;s original material was written by Heaton and Rotheray.

After the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Welcome to the Beautiful South&quot; (1989, recorded as a quintet), they were joined by a succession of female vocalists. The following artists performed lead and backing vocals alongside Heaton and Hemingway: Briana Corrigan for albums two and three after appearing as a guest vocalist on the first; Jacqui Abbott for the fourth to seventh albums; Alison Wheeler for the final three Beautiful South albums.

The group are known for wry and socially observant lyrics. They broke up in January 2007, saying the split was due to &quot;musical similarities&quot;, having sold around 15 million records.

==History==
===1988: Formation===
Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway had initially come to attention as (respectively) the lead singer and &quot;singing drummer&quot; of the successful Hull jangle pop band the Housemartins, who had scored seven UK Top 40 singles and two Top 10 albums between 1986 and 1988. (Heaton was with the Housemartins for their entire existence; Hemingway joined in time for their second and final album.) The band was known for blending overt socialist politics and a form of Christianity, having baited the British monarchy, the building industry, and South African apartheid in their songs as well as including gospel elements in their music. The Housemartins said they had set a fixed lifespan for themselves; the members duly brought the band to an end in 1988 at the height of its success. Heaton and Hemingway immediately began work on setting up a new band, naming it &quot;the Beautiful South&quot; as a sarcastic comment on their staunch Northern roots.

The third initial bandmember was Dave Rotheray, a songwriting guitarist who had previously played with Hemingway in two other Hull bands, the Newpolitans and the Velvetones. At the time Rotheray was studying for a PhD at the University of Hull and living on Grafton Street, where Heaton also lived. Rotheray and Heaton became the songwriting team for the Beautiful South, which was conceived as a quintet with Heaton and Hemingway (who was no longer drumming) as the two lead singers. The core band was completed by Dave Stead (ex-Luddites/Vicious Circle) on drums, and former Housemartins roadie Sean Welch on bass guitar. Also important to the band&#x27;s sound was studio keyboard player Damon Butcher—although never an official member of the group, he ended up playing virtually all the piano and keyboard parts on the band&#x27;s albums.

===1989: &quot;Welcome to the Beautiful South&quot;, addition of Corrigan===
Their first album, &quot;Welcome to the Beautiful South&quot;, was released in 1989 and promptly produced a number two UK singles chart hit, &quot;Song for Whoever&quot;. With the follow-up single &quot;You Keep It All In&quot; reaching number eight and &quot;I&#x27;ll Sail This Ship Alone&quot; reaching number 31, the band were soon set to equal or surpass the success of the Housemartins, while the songwriting built on and expanded the trenchant social critiques which the previous band had been known for. Topics included nationalism, domestic violence, football hooliganism and the self-serving industry of love songs, and the album&#x27;s disturbing cover art also drew attention. Northern Irish singer Briana Corrigan was featured as a background vocalist on the album. Her contributions proved so successful that she was soon promoted to full membership status, as the band&#x27;s third vocalist.

===1990-91: &quot;Choke&quot;===
In 1990, the Beautiful South released their second album, &quot;Choke&quot;. Two singles—&quot;My Book&quot; and &quot;Let Love Speak Up Itself&quot;—charted outside the Top 40, but the album also provided the band&#x27;s only Number 1 hit, a Hemingway/Corrigan duet called &quot;A Little Time&quot;. The video, featuring the aftermath of a domestic fight, won the 1991 BRIT Award for Best Video.

===1992: &quot;0898 Beautiful South&quot;, Corrigan&#x27;s departure===
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;0898 Beautiful South&quot;, followed in 1992. It provided another Top 20 hit, &quot;Bell Bottomed Tear&quot;, as well as two further Top 30 hits, &quot;Old Red Eyes Is Back&quot; and &quot;We Are Each Other&quot;, although a fourth single, &quot;36D&quot;, only placed in the Top 50. &quot;We Are Each Other&quot; also became the band&#x27;s biggest hit in the United States, peaking at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1992.

Both &quot;Choke&quot; and &quot;0898 Beautiful South&quot; illustrated the growing fullness of the band&#x27;s sound. Both featured Pete Thoms and Gary Barnacle as regular contributors on brass and woodwind, and also featured Corrigan as lead vocalist on several tracks. Her contribution helped to characterise the bittersweet kitchen sink dramas played out in the band&#x27;s often barbed songs, and allowed Heaton and Rotheray to explore and express female perspectives in their songwriting. However, the latter approach had mixed success, demonstrated later in 1992 when Corrigan chose to leave the band to pursue a solo career. Although her decision was partly prompted by a desire to record and promote her own material (which was not getting exposure within the Beautiful South), she had also had ethical disagreements over some of Heaton&#x27;s lyrics, most notably &quot;Mini-correct&quot;, &quot;Worthless Lie&quot; and the &quot;0898 Beautiful South&quot; single &quot;36D&quot;, which criticised the British glamour industry via scathing comments about glamour models. Five years later, Hemingway admitted, &quot;we all agree that we should have targeted the media as sexist instead of blaming the girls for taking off their tops&quot;. Heaton corroborated this view in 2022, stating, &quot;&#x27;36D&#x27; hasn&#x27;t dated well. I like the idea of blaming the newspapers, but blaming the model involved was wrong.&quot;

===1993: Abbot joins, &quot;Miaow&quot;===
In 1993, St Helens supermarket shop-worker Jacqui Abbott was brought on board to fill in as the new third lead vocalist for the band. Heaton had heard her sing at an after-show party in St Helens and remembered her vocal talents. Heaton referred to her as &quot;the lass from the glass&quot;—a reference to the Pilkington factory in St Helens. Abbott&#x27;s first album with the band was &quot;Miaow&quot; in the same year. Hits included &quot;Good as Gold (Stupid as Mud)&quot; and a cover of Fred Neil&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;&quot;, previously popularised by Harry Nilsson.

===1994-95: &quot;Carry On Up the Charts&quot; ===
In November 1994 &quot;Carry On Up the Charts&quot; was released, a &quot;best of&quot; compilation consisting of the singles to date plus new track &quot;One Last Love Song&quot;. Released at a time when the group&#x27;s album sales had been waning, the album was a huge commercial success. It secured the Christmas number one spot on the charts and became the second-best selling album of the year. In 1995, the band briefly supported R.E.M. on the British leg of their world tour when they covered for Oasis, who pulled out of R.E.M&#x27;s concerts at McAlpine Stadium in Huddersfield on July 25 and 26. The Beautiful South performed Oasis&#x27; &quot;Some Might Say&quot;, dedicating the song to Oasis fans in the audience.

===1996-97: &quot;Blue Is the Colour&quot; ===
The 1996 album &quot;Blue Is the Colour&quot; sold over a million copies, and featured hit singles &quot;Rotterdam&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Marry Her&quot;. In 1997, the Beautiful South headlined stadium concerts for the first and last time, in Huddersfield and at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London. Support for the Huddersfield concert was provided by Cast and the Lightning Seeds.

===1998-99: &quot;Quench&quot;===
The album &quot;Quench&quot; (1998) was released with similar commercial success, again reaching number one in the UK album charts. &quot;Perfect 10&quot;, the first single to be released from the album, also provided the band with further singles chart success. The album is also notable for being more uptempo, and being the first on which Heaton and Hemingway&#x27;s former Housemartins colleague Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim) was used in a consultancy role.

===2000-00: &quot;Painting It Red&quot;, Abbott&#x27;s departure===
Although 2000&#x27;s &quot;Painting It Red&quot; album reached Number 2 in the UK charts, the band suffered difficulties in its promotion and in touring, and a substantial number of the CDs were faulty. Jacqui Abbott left the band in the same year, discouraged by the pressures of touring and needing to concentrate on looking after her son, who had just been diagnosed with autism. 

===2001-02: &quot;Solid Bronze&quot;, band break, Heaton solo work===
After completing their tour obligations, the band marked time with a second greatest-hits album, &quot;Solid Bronze&quot;, in 2001, and took time off to refresh themselves. Heaton embarked on a solo career under the Biscuit Boy (a.k.a. Crakerman) alias and released the &quot;Fat Chance&quot; album in 2001. It did not sell well, although it was critically acclaimed and was reissued under Heaton&#x27;s own name the following year.

===2003-5: Wheeler joins, &quot;Gaze&quot; and &quot;Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs&quot;===
The Beautiful South regrouped in 2003, with new recruit Alison Wheeler taking on the role of female singer. The lineup recorded &quot;Gaze&quot; in 2003, following it with 2004&#x27;s &quot;Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs&quot;, an album of unusually arranged cover tunes, including &quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot;, &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Stone in Love With You&quot;. A track from the album, &quot;This Old Skin&quot;, was presented as a cover of a song by an obscure band called &quot;The Heppelbaums&quot;; it was later revealed to be an original Heaton/Rotheray composition.

===2006: &quot;Superbi&quot;===
The final Beautiful South album, &quot;Superbi&quot;, was released on 15 May 2006. The first single, &quot;Manchester&quot;, started off as a poem—&quot;If rain makes Britain great, then Manchester is greater&quot;—and was, in Heaton&#x27;s words, &quot;a sodden tribute&quot; to the city in which he now lived.

===2007-: Split, post-split projects===
After a band meeting on 30 January 2007, the Beautiful South decided to split. They released a statement on 31 January 2007, in which they joked that their reasons for splitting were &quot;musical similarities&quot;—an ironic reference to &quot;musical differences&quot;, which are often cited as the reason for a band&#x27;s split. &quot;The band would like to thank everyone for their 19 wonderful years in music&quot;, the statement said.

In June 2007, the band&#x27;s music was featured in a jukebox musical entitled &quot;The Slide&quot; (the book is by Adrian Davis); it premiered at the Phoenix Theatre at New College, Swindon.

In 2009, band members Dave Hemingway, Alison Wheeler and Dave Stead joined with regular Beautiful South session musicians Damon Butcher, Gaz Birtles and Tony Robinson to form The South, performing the music of the Beautiful South as well as releasing a new album, &quot;Sweet Refrains&quot;, in 2012. In 2013, Paul Heaton reunited with former Beautiful South vocalist Jacqui Abbott to perform as Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott.

<text>In typography, italic type is a cursive font based on a stylised form of calligraphic handwriting. Along with blackletter and roman type, it served as one of the major typefaces in the history of Western typography.

Owing to the influence from calligraphy, italics normally slant slightly to the right, &quot;like so&quot;. Different glyph shapes from roman type are usually usedanother influence from calligraphyand upper-case letters may have swashes, flourishes inspired by ornate calligraphy.

Historically, italics were a distinct style of type used entirely separately from roman type, but they have come to be used in conjunction—most fonts now come with a roman type and an oblique version (generally called &quot;italic&quot; though often not true italics). In this usage, italics are a way to emphasise key points in a printed text, to identify many types of creative works, to cite foreign words or phrases, or, when quoting a speaker, a way to show which words they stressed. One manual of English usage described italics as &quot;the print equivalent of underlining&quot;; in other words, underscore in a manuscript directs a typesetter to use italic.

In fonts which do not have true italics, oblique type may be used instead. The difference between true italics and oblique type is that true italics have some letterforms different from the roman type, but in oblique type letters are just slanted without changing the roman type form.

The name comes from the fact that calligraphy-inspired typefaces were first designed in Italy, to replace documents traditionally written in a handwriting style called chancery hand. Aldus Manutius and Ludovico Arrighi (both between the 15th and 16th centuries) were the main type designers involved in this process at the time.

==History==

Italic type was first used by Aldus Manutius and his press in Venice in 1500.

Manutius intended his italic type to be used not for emphasis but for the text of small, easily carried editions of popular books (often poetry), replicating the style of handwritten manuscripts of the period. The choice of using italic type, rather than the roman type in general use at the time, was apparently made to suggest informality in editions designed for leisure reading. Manutius&#x27; italic type was cut by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo (who later, following a dispute with Manutius, claimed to have conceived it). It replicated handwriting of the period following from the style of Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli, possibly even Manutius&#x27; own.

The first use in a complete volume was a 1501 edition of Virgil dedicated to Italy, although it had been briefly used in the frontispiece of a 1500 edition of Catherine of Siena&#x27;s letters. In 1501, Aldus wrote to his friend Scipio:

Manutius&#x27; italic was different in some ways from modern italics, being conceived for the specific use of replicating the layout of contemporary calligraphers like Pomponio Leto and Bartolomeo Sanvito. The capital letters were upright capitals on the model of Roman square capitals, shorter than the ascending lower-case italic letters, and were used at the start of each line followed by a clear space before the first lower-case letter. While modern italics are often more condensed than roman types, historian Harry Carter describes Manutius&#x27; italic as about the same width as roman type. To replicate handwriting, Griffo cut at least sixty-five tied letters (ligatures) in the Aldine Dante and Virgil of 1501. Italic typefaces of the following century used varying but reduced numbers of ligatures.

Italic type rapidly became very popular and was widely (and inaccurately) imitated. The Venetian Senate gave Aldus exclusive right to its use, a patent confirmed by three successive Popes, but it was widely counterfeited as early as 1502. Griffo, who had left Venice in a business dispute, cut a version for printer Girolamo &quot;Gershom&quot; Soncino, and other copies appeared in Italy and in Lyons. The Italians called the character Aldino, while others called it Italic. Italics spread rapidly; historian H. D. L. Vervliet dates the first production of italics in Paris to 1512. Some printers of Northern Europe used home-made supplements to add characters not used in Italian, or mated it to alternative capitals, including Gothic ones.
Besides imitations of Griffo&#x27;s italic and its derivatives, a second wave appeared of &quot;chancery&quot; italics, most popular in Italy, which Vervliet describes as being based on &quot;a more deliberate and formal handwriting [with] longer ascenders and descenders, sometimes with curved or bulbous terminals, and [often] only available in the bigger sizes.&quot; Chancery italics were introduced around 1524 by Arrighi, a calligrapher and author of a calligraphy textbook who began a career as a printer in Rome, and also by Giovanni Antonio Tagliente of Venice, with imitations rapidly appearing in France by 1528. Chancery italics faded as a style over the course of the sixteenth century, although revivals were made beginning in the twentieth century. Chancery italics may have backward-pointing serifs or round terminals pointing forwards on the ascenders.

Italic capitals with a slope were introduced in the sixteenth century. The first printer known to have used them was Johann or Johannes Singriener in Vienna in 1524, and the practice spread to Germany, France and Belgium. Particularly influential in the switch to sloped capitals as a general practice was Robert Granjon, a prolific and extremely precise French punchcutter particularly renowned for his skill in cutting italics. Vervliet comments that among punchcutters in France &quot;the main name associated with the change is Granjon&#x27;s.&quot;

The evolution of use of italic to show emphasis happened in the sixteenth century and was a clear norm by the seventeenth. The trend of presenting types as matching in typefounders&#x27; specimens developed also over this period. Italics developed stylistically over the following centuries, tracking changing tastes in calligraphy and type design. One major development that slowly became popular from the end of the seventeenth century was a switch to an open form &quot;h&quot; matching the &quot;n&quot;, a development seen in the &quot;Romain du roi&quot; type of the 1690s, replacing the folded, closed-form &quot;h&quot; of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century italics, and sometimes simplification of the entrance stroke.

==Examples==

True italic styles are traditionally somewhat narrower than roman fonts. Here is an example of &quot;normal (roman)&quot; and &quot;true italics&quot; text:

In &quot;oblique&quot; text, the same type is used as in normal type, but slanted to the right:

==Usage==
* Emphasis: &quot;Smith wasn&#x27;t the guilty party, it&#x27;s true&quot;. This often corresponds with stress in speech.
* The titles of works that stand by themselves, such as books (including those within a larger series), albums, paintings, plays, television shows, movies, and periodicals: &quot;He wrote his thesis on &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;&quot;. Works that appear within larger works, such as short stories, poems, newspaper articles, songs, and television episodes are not italicised, but merely set off in quotation marks. When italics are unavailable, such as on a typewriter or websites that do not support formatting, an underscore or quotes are often used instead.
* The names of ships: &quot;The &quot;Queen Mary&quot; sailed last night.&quot;
* Foreign words, including the Latin binomial nomenclature in the taxonomy of living organisms: &quot;A splendid &quot;coq au vin&quot; was served&quot;; &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.
* The names of newspapers and magazines: &quot;My favorite magazine is &quot;Psychology Today&quot;, and my favorite newspaper is the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.&quot;
* Mentioning a word as an example of a word rather than for its semantic content (see use–mention distinction): &quot;The word &quot;the&quot; is an article&quot;.
** Using a letter or number mentioned as itself:
*** John was annoyed; they had forgotten the &quot;h&quot; in his name once again.
*** When she saw her name beside the &quot;1&quot; on the rankings, she finally had proof that she was the best.
* Introducing or defining terms, especially technical terms or those used in an unusual or different way: &quot;Freudian psychology is based on the &quot;ego&quot;, the &quot;super-ego&quot;, and the &quot;id&quot;.&quot;; &quot;An &quot;even&quot; number is one that is a multiple of 2.&quot;
* Sometimes in novels to indicate a character&#x27;s thought process: &quot;&quot;This can&#x27;t be happening&quot;, thought Mary.&quot;
* Italics are used in the King James Version to words &quot;that have no equivalent in the original text but that are necessary in English&quot;: &quot;And God saw the light, that &quot;it was&quot; good&quot;.
* Algebraic symbols (constants and variables) are conventionally typeset in italics: &quot;The solution is &quot;n&quot; = 2.&quot;
* Symbols for physical quantities and mathematical constants: &quot;The speed of light, &quot;c&quot;, is approximately equal to 3.00×108 m/s.&quot;
* In biology, gene names (for example, &quot;lacZ&quot;) are written in italics whereas protein names are written in roman type (e.g. β-galactosidase, which the &quot;lacZ&quot; gene codes for).
* Italics are frequently used in comics. A letterer may opt to use italic text for a variety of situations, such as internal monologues, captions, words from other languages, and text rendered inside certain types of speech balloons (such as thought balloons). Bolded words are commonly also rendered in italic.
* In older English usage, writers italicised words much more freely, for emphasis, for instance John Donne:
*:No man is an &quot;Iland&quot;, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the &quot;Continent&quot;, a part of the &quot;maine&quot;; if a &quot;Clod&quot; bee washed away by the &quot;Sea&quot;, &quot;Europe&quot; is the lesse, as well as if a &quot;Promontorie&quot; were ...
* In numbering UK Acts of Parliament within a given year (prior to 1963, a given session), personal acts have italic Arabic numerals, whereas public general acts have plain Arabic numerals and local acts have lowercase Roman numerals.

==Oblique type compared to italics==

Oblique type (or slanted roman, sloped roman) is type that is slanted, but lacking cursive letterforms, with features like a non-descending &quot;f&quot; and double-storey &quot;a&quot;, unlike &quot;true italics&quot;. Many sans-serif typefaces use oblique designs (sometimes called &quot;sloped roman&quot; styles) instead of italic ones; some have both italic and oblique variants. Type designers have described oblique type as less organic and calligraphic than italics, which in some situations may be preferred. Contemporary type designer Jeremy Tankard stated that he had avoided a true italic &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; in his sans-serif Bliss due to finding them &quot;too soft&quot;, while Hoefler and Frere-Jones have described obliques as more &quot;keen and insistent&quot; than true italics. Adrian Frutiger has described obliques as more appropriate to the aesthetic of sans-serifs than italics. In contrast, Martin Majoor has argued that obliques do not contrast enough from the regular style.

Almost all modern serif fonts have true italic designs. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of type foundries such as American Type Founders and Genzsch &amp; Heyse offered serif typefaces with oblique rather than italic designs, especially display typefaces but these designs (such as Genzsch Antiqua) have mostly disappeared. An exception is American Type Founders&#x27; Bookman, offered in some releases with the oblique of its metal type version. An unusual example of an oblique font from the inter-war period is the display face Koch Antiqua. With a partly oblique lower case, it also makes the italic capitals inline in the style of blackletter capitals in the larger sizes of the metal type. It was developed by Rudolph Koch, a type designer who had previously specialised in blackletter font design (which does not use italics); Walter Tracy described his design as &quot;uninhibited by the traditions of roman and italic&quot;.

The printing historian and artistic director Stanley Morison was for a time in the inter-war period interested in the oblique type style, which he felt stood out in text less than a true italic and should supersede it. He argued in his article &quot;Towards an Ideal Italic&quot; that serif book typefaces should have as the default sloped form an oblique and as a complement a script typeface where a more decorative form was preferred. He made an attempt to promote the idea by commissioning the typeface Perpetua from Eric Gill with a sloped roman rather than an italic, but came to find the style unattractive; Perpetua&#x27;s italic when finally issued had the conventional italic &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;f&quot;. Morison wrote to his friend, type designer Jan van Krimpen, that in developing Perpetua&#x27;s italic &quot;we did not give enough slope to it. When we added more slope, it seemed that the font required a little more cursive to it.&quot; A few other type designers replicated his approach for a time: Van Krimpen&#x27;s Romulus and William Addison Dwiggins&#x27; Electra were both released with obliques. Morison&#x27;s Times New Roman typeface has a very traditional true italic in the style of the late eighteenth century, which he later wryly commented owed &quot;more to Didot than dogma&quot;.

Some serif designs primarily intended for headings rather than body text are not provided with an italic, Engravers and some releases of Cooper Black and Baskerville Old Style being common examples of this. In addition, computer programmes may generate an &#x27;italic&#x27; style by simply slanting the regular style if they cannot find an italic or oblique style, though this may look awkward with serif fonts for which an italic is expected. Professional designers normally do not simply tilt fonts to generate obliques but make subtle corrections to correct the distorted curves this introduces. Many sans-serif families have oblique fonts labelled as italic, whether or not they include &quot;true italic&quot; characteristics.

==More complex usage==

===Italics within italics===

If something within a run of italics needs to be italicised itself, the type is normally switched back to non-italicized (roman) type: &quot;&quot;I think &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; had a chapter about that&quot;, thought Mary.&quot; In this example, the title (&quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;) is within an italicised thought process and therefore this title is non-italicised. It is followed by the main narrative that is outside both. It is also non-italicised and therefore not obviously separated from the former. The reader must find additional criteria to distinguish between these. Here, apart from using the attribute of italic–non-italic styles, the title also employs the attribute of capitalization. Citation styles in which book titles are italicised differ on how to deal with a book title within a book title; for example, MLA style specifies a switch back to roman type, whereas &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; (14.94) specifies the use of quotation marks (&quot;A Key to Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Process and Reality&quot;&quot;). An alternative option is to switch to an &#x27;upright italic&#x27; style if the typeface used has one; this is discussed below.

===Left-leaning italics===

Left-leaning italics are now rare in Latin script, where they are mostly used for the occasional attention-grabbing effect. They were once more common, however, being used for example in legal documents.

They are more common in Arabic script.
In certain Arabic fonts (e.g.: Adobe Arabic, Boutros Ads), the italic font has the top of the letter leaning to the left, instead of leaning to the right. Some font families, such as Venus, Roemisch, Topografische Zahlentafel, include left leaning fonts and letters designed for German cartographic map production, even though they do not support Arabic characters.

====Iranic font style====
In the 1950s, Gholamhossein Mosahab invented the &quot;Iranic font style&quot;, a back-slanted italic form to go with the right-to-left direction of
the script.

===Upright italics===

Since italic styles clearly look different from regular (roman) styles, it is possible to have &#x27;upright italic&#x27; designs that have a cursive style but remain upright. In Latin-script countries, upright italics are rare but are sometimes used in mathematics or in complex texts where a section of text already in italics needs a &#x27;double italic&#x27; style to add emphasis to it. Donald Knuth&#x27;s Computer Modern has an alternate upright italic as an alternative to its standard italic, since its intended use is mathematical typesetting.

Font families with an upright or near-upright italic only include Jan van Krimpen&#x27;s Romanée, Eric Gill&#x27;s Joanna, Martin Majoor&#x27;s FF Seria and Frederic Goudy&#x27;s Deepdene. The popular book typeface Bembo has been sold with two italics: one reasonably straightforward design that is commonly used today, and an alternative upright &#x27;Condensed Italic&#x27; design, far more calligraphic, as a more eccentric alternative.
This italic face was designed by Alfred Fairbank and named &quot;Bembo Condensed Italic&quot;, Monotype series 294. Some Arts and Crafts movement-influenced printers such as Gill also revived the original italic system of italic lower-case only from the nineteenth century onwards.

===Parentheses===
&quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; suggests that parentheses and brackets surrounding text that begins and ends in italic or oblique type should also be italicised &quot;(as in this example)&quot;, to avoid problems such as overlapping and unequally spaced characters. An exception to this rule applies when only one end of the parenthetical is italicised (in which case roman type is preferred, &quot;as on the right of this example&quot;).

In &quot;The Elements of Typographic Style&quot;, however, it is argued that, since Italic delimiters are not historically correct, the upright versions should always be used, while paying close attention to kerning.

===Substitutes===
In media where italicization is not possible, alternatives are used as substitutes:

* In typewritten or handwritten text, underlining is typically used.
* In plain-text computer files, including e-mail communication, italicised words are often indicated by surrounding them with slashes or other matched delimiters. For example:
** I was /really/ annoyed.
** They &gt;completely&lt; forgot me!
** I had _nothing_ to do with it. (Commonly interpreted as underlining, which is an alternative to italics.)
** It was *absolutely* horrible. (Commonly interpreted as bold. This and the previous example signify italic in Markdown, where bolding uses **double asterisks**, and underlining uses __double underscores__.)
* Where the italics do not indicate emphasis, but are marking a title or where a word is being mentioned, quotation marks may be substituted:
** The word &quot;the&quot; is an article.
** The term &quot;even number&quot; refers to a number that is a multiple of 2.
** The novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was written by Ray Bradbury.

===OpenType===
OpenType has the codice_1 feature tag to substitute a character to italic form with single font. In addition, the OpenType Font Variation has codice_1 axis for the transition between italic and non-italic forms and codice_3 axis for the oblique angle of characters.

===Web pages===
In HTML, the codice_4 element is used to produce italic (or oblique) text. When the author wants to indicate emphasised text, modern Web standards recommend using the codice_5 element, because it conveys that the content is to be emphasised, even if it cannot be displayed in italics. Conversely, if the italics are purely ornamental rather than meaningful, then semantic markup practices would dictate that the author use the Cascading Style Sheets declaration codice_6 along with an appropriate, semantic class name instead of an codice_4 or codice_5 element.

===Unicode===
In Unicode, the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols block includes Latin and Greek letters in italics and boldface. However, Unicode expressly recommends against using these characters in general text in place of presentational markup.

<text>Morris &quot;Mort&quot; Drucker (March 22, 1929 – April 9, 2020) was an American caricaturist and comics artist best known as a contributor for over five decades in &quot;Mad&quot;, where he specialized in satires on the leading feature films and television series.

==Personal life==
Drucker was born in Brooklyn, New York City, with some sources listing his birth date as March 22, 1929, and others as March 29. He was the son of Sarah (Spielvogel), a homemaker, and Edward Drucker, a businessman. His family was Jewish. He attended Brooklyn&#x27;s Erasmus Hall High School. There he met his future wife Barbara, whom he married shortly after her graduation. The couple moved to Long Island, living in Syosset, where they brought up two daughters, Laurie and Melanie; their family eventually expanded with three grandchildren.

==Career==
Drucker entered the comics field by assisting Bert Whitman on the Publishers-Hall newspaper comic strip &quot;Debbie Dean&quot; in 1947 when he was 18, based on a recommendation from Will Eisner. He then joined the staff of National Periodical Publications (DC Comics), where he worked as a retoucher. While at DC, Drucker also ghosted &quot;The Mountain Boys&quot;, Paul Webb&#x27;s regular gag panel for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. Early in the 1950s, Drucker left his DC staff gig and began doing full-time freelance work for a number of comic book publishers such as Dell, Atlas and St. John&#x27;s, as well as several humor and war titles for his former employer.

===&quot;Mad&quot;===
In the fall of 1956, shortly after the departure of &quot;Mad&quot;″s founding editor Harvey Kurtzman, Drucker found his way to &quot;Mad&quot;. His first visit to the magazine&#x27;s offices coincided with a World Series broadcast, and publisher Bill Gaines told Drucker that if the Brooklyn Dodgers won the game, he would be given a drawing assignment. The Dodgers won. Capricious though Drucker&#x27;s alleged audition process may have been, it was a good anecdote. Years later, Gaines unsurprisingly confessed, &quot;We would have hired him anyway.&quot;

Drucker had arrived at the &quot;Mad&quot; offices with pages from his Hopalong Cassidy comic book work for DC Comics and some of his &quot;Mountain Boys&quot; strips, as well as a humorous &quot;little situation&quot; featuring The Lone Ranger and Tonto that he had specifically drawn for the interview. Though this work was unlike the likenesses and continuities he would become best known for, the &quot;Mad&quot; staff reacted favorably. The first to review Drucker&#x27;s portfolio was &quot;Mad&quot; associate editor Nick Meglin, who admitted, &quot;I didn&#x27;t spot how great he was at caricatures. Not at first. But then, he wasn&#x27;t that great then.&quot; Drucker said that he &quot;just wanted to be an artist ... to get paid for drawing anything,&quot; and only started focusing on caricature work, because he started getting more of those assignments. &quot;That&#x27;s when I realized I&#x27;d found my calling,&quot; said Drucker. At the time of Drucker&#x27;s arrival, &quot;Mad&quot; did not regularly feature television and movie satires. Editor Al Feldstein credited Drucker&#x27;s style and ability for the decision to start featuring them in every issue.

For well over a decade, &quot;Mad&quot; had difficulty obtaining promotional photos that Drucker could use as source material for his drawings. When he was illustrating &quot;Mad&quot; parodies, Drucker&#x27;s colleague Angelo Torres brought a camera into movie theaters and snapped pictures of the screen. Eventually, a generation of &quot;Mad&quot; fans grew up and some became Hollywood publicists, making Drucker&#x27;s research easier.

By the time he wound down his &quot;Mad&quot; career 55 years later, Drucker held the longest uninterrupted tenure of any &quot;Mad&quot; artist. Drucker has the most bylined articles by any &quot;Mad&quot; artist who does not also write his own material, with more than 400.

===Other work===
Drucker also remained active for DC, illustrating &quot;War Stories&quot;, among other titles. Beginning in 1959, he spent four years drawing DC&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Bob Hope&quot; comic book. Drucker credits this stint as a key moment in his career because it focused his work on caricature.

In 1962, Drucker teamed with the prolific humor writer Paul Laikin on the highly successful &quot;JFK Coloring Book&quot; (Kanrom Publishers), which sold 2,500,000 copies. Two decades later, Drucker illustrated similar coloring books on Ollie North and Ronald Reagan. His film posters include Universal&#x27;s &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973), directed by George Lucas with Drucker also drawing the high school yearbook pictures in the film trailer.

Drucker also pursued assignments in television animation, movie poster art and magazine illustration, including covers for &quot;Time&quot;, some of which are in the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. His album covers include art for the pop band The Bears and the Anthrax album &quot;State of Euphoria,&quot; as well as humor albums in the vein of his own &quot;JFK Coloring Book&quot; including &quot;The LBJ Menagerie&quot; and &quot;The New First Family, 1968&quot;. In addition to books collecting his own work, he has provided illustrations for numerous books by others, including children&#x27;s books, humor books and satire. He drew the prop cartoons used in the 1957 Broadway musical comedy, &quot;Rumple&quot;.

Between 1984 and 1987, Drucker collaborated with Jerry Dumas (and John Reiner) on the daily comic strip &quot;Benchley&quot;. Set in the White House, the plot revolved around the fictive character Benchley who acted as the assistant and admirer of contemporary president Ronald Reagan. Dumas commented, &quot;Nobody ever did a strip about the government. It&#x27;s a wonderful place to set a strip. There&#x27;s so much room for humor in the White House.&quot; &quot;Benchley&quot; was syndicated by the Register and Tribune Syndicate.

In 1990, Drucker designed the Supercup for Target. The following year, for the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, Drucker and executive Mitchell Erick created the Frugies (pronounced &quot;fru-jees&quot;) to promote June as National Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Month. The campaign included such characters as Auntie Broccoli, Lord Mushroom, Pepe L&#x27;Pepper, E. J. Cobb, Peach Velour, Penelope Pear and Adam Apple.

== Style ==
In 2012, Drucker discussed his art style, and how he applied it to his &quot;Mad&quot; assignments:
I&#x27;ve always considered a caricature to be the complete person, not just a likeness. Hands, in particular, have always been a prime focus for me as they can be as expressive of character as the exaggerations and distortions a caricaturist searches for. I try to capture the essence of the person, not just facial features ... I&#x27;ve discovered through years of working at capturing a humorous likeness that it&#x27;s not about the features themselves as much as the space between the features. We all have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, hair, and jaw lines, but yet we all look different. What makes that so is the space between them.The artist is actually creating his own storyboard for the film. I become the &quot;camera&quot; and look for angles, lighting, close-ups, wide angles, long shots—just as a director does to tell the story in the most visually interesting way he can. My first sketches are as much composition and design ideas as they are character and action images ... I don&#x27;t want to get too involved in the juicy parts since some of what I&#x27;m doing will be modified or discarded as I get further involved in the storytelling. I then stand back and look at the page as a complete unit to make sure it&#x27;s designed well: &quot;Hmmm, three close-up panels in a row of characters talking. Better change that middle panel to a far shot. Maybe make that panel an open vignette.&quot; ...  Then I place the facing pages together and look at how the spread holds together, and sometimes make changes based on that.

== Praise ==
When the magazine&#x27;s parody of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was published in 1980, drawn by Drucker, the magazine received a cease and desist letter from George Lucas&#x27; lawyers demanding that the issue be pulled from sale, and that &quot;Mad&quot; destroy the printing plates, surrender the original art, and turn over all profits from the issue. Unbeknownst to them, George Lucas had just sent &quot;Mad&quot; an effusive letter praising the parody, and declaring, &quot;Special Oscars should be awarded to Drucker and DeBartolo, the George Bernard Shaw and Leonardo da Vinci of comic satire.&quot; Publisher Gaines mailed a copy of the letter to Lucas&#x27; lawyers with a handwritten message across the top: &quot;That&#x27;s funny, George liked it!&quot; There was no further communication on the matter. Drucker had also worked on the advertising campaign for Lucas&#x27; earlier film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. In his introduction to the &quot;Mad About Star Wars&quot; book, Lucas wrote, &quot;I have always defended &quot;Mad&quot; from my lawyers.&quot;

In a 1985 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, when Johnny Carson asked Michael J. Fox, &quot;When did you really know you&#x27;d made it in show business?&quot; Fox replied, &quot;When Mort Drucker drew my head.&quot;

Nick Meglin called Drucker &quot;number one in a field of one.&quot; Charles Schulz wrote, &quot;Frankly, I don&#x27;t know how he does it, and I stand in a long list of admirers ... I think he draws everything the way we would all like to draw.&quot; In 2012, referring to Drucker&#x27;s splash page for &quot;Mad&quot;″s parody of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, the Comics Reporter&#x27;s Tom Spurgeon wrote, &quot;The way he draws James Caan&#x27;s eyebrow is worth some folks&#x27; entire careers.&quot;

==Awards==
Mort Drucker&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; covers are in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. He was recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society Special Features Award (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988), its Reuben Award (1987), Eisner Award Hall of Fame (2010) and induction into the Society&#x27;s Hall of Fame (2017). Drucker was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Art Institute of Boston. He was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1996.

==Death==
Drucker died on April 9, 2020, in his Woodbury, New York home. His daughter Laurie reported to Associated Press that the previous week he had experienced respiratory problems and had trouble walking, but she did not state the actual cause of his death. Laurie added that her father had not been tested for the coronavirus.

<doc id="265930" wikidata="Q7091751" url="?curid=265930" title="Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.">
<text>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, 523 U.S. 75 (1998), is a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court. The case arose out of a suit for sex discrimination by a male oil-rig worker, who claimed that he was repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by his male co-workers with the acquiescence of his employer. The Court held that the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against workplace discrimination &quot;because of... sex&quot; applied to harassment in the workplace between members of the same sex.

==Background==
In late October 1991, Joseph Oncale was working for Sundowner Offshore Services on a Chevron USA Inc. oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. He was employed as a roustabout on an eight-man crew. On several occasions, Oncale was forcibly subjected to sex-related, humiliating actions against him by his coworkers in the presence of the rest of the crew. Oncale was also sodomized with a bar of soap and threatened with rape. Oncale&#x27;s complaints to supervisory personnel produced no remedial action. Instead, the company&#x27;s Safety Compliance Clerk called him a name suggesting homosexuality. Oncale eventually quit, asking that his pink slip reflect that he &quot;voluntarily left due to sexual harassment and verbal abuse.&quot;

Oncale filed a complaint against Sundowner in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging that he was discriminated against in his employment because of his sex. Relying on earlier precedents, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendant: &quot;Mr. Oncale, a male, has no cause of action under Title VII for harassment by male co-workers.&quot; Oncale appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the decision. After granting a petition for writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court reversed the decision.

==Decision==
Justice Scalia, writing for the unanimous court (with Justice Thomas concurring), reversed the decision of the district court and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with the instruction that a male can be discriminated against by members of the same sex under Title VII.

&quot;Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services&quot; set the precedent for analyzing same-sex harassment and sexual harassment without motivation of &quot;sexual desire&quot; by stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable if it places the victim in an objectively-disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of the victim or the harasser.

The case was subsequently remanded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to the trial court. The case was then settled out of court.

==Impact and implementation==
The application of the &quot;Oncale&quot; case has caused some difficulty in the lower federal courts, which have struggled with how to determine whether any particular case of same-sex harassment is &quot;because of sex.&quot; In particular, courts have struggled with how to deal with harassment that appears to be based on actual or perceived sexual orientation because employment discrimination based on sexual orientation was not explicitly forbidden by federal law.

In July 2015, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that employment discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and used the &quot;Oncale&quot; decision as a basis&quot;.&quot;

Because it set a precedent regarding harassment &quot;because of sex,&quot; &quot;Oncale v. Sundowner&quot; has been lauded as a landmark gay rights case, even though all those involved were heterosexual. In the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Oncale&quot;, the inclusion of sexual discrimination between same sex individuals as a protected class under Title VII set an important precedent of expanding the interpretation of protected classes under § 2000e-2(a)(1). This precedent was later reflected upon in &quot;Bostock v. Clayton County&quot; along with two other important cases, all of which considered the word &quot;sex&quot; and its definition in regards to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

<text>The Guangxu Emperor (14 August 1871 – 14 November 1908), also known by his temple name Emperor Dezong of Qing, personal name Zaitian, was the eleventh emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the ninth Qing emperor to rule over China proper, from 1875 to 1908. His reign was largely dominated by his maternal aunt Empress Dowager Cixi, who was his regent for much of his nominal rule except in the time from 1889 to 1898. He initiated the radical Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in the summer of 1898 but was abruptly stopped when the Empress Dowager launched a coup on 21 September, after which he was held under virtual house arrest until his death one decade later.

Emperor Guangxu was the second son of Yixuan, Prince Chun (a son of the Daoguang Emperor), and his mother, Yehenara Wanzhen, was the sister of Empress Dowager Cixi. After Emperor Tongzhi&#x27;s death in 1874, he was supported by the two Empress Dowagers (Ci&#x27;an and Cixi) to succeed the throne, being adopted at the age of three by Emperor Xianfeng and the two Empress Dowagers, thereby inheriting the throne. During the early years of his reign, the two dowagers jointly handled state affairs. As Ci&#x27;an died in 1881, Cixi continued to act as the sole regent. In 1889, Guangxu got married and announced his personal rule. After the failure of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in 1898, he was confined by Cixi in the Yingtai Pavilion of Zhongnanhai, completely losing his ruling power. In November 1908, he died of arsenic poisoning at Yingtai. He reigned for 34 years, ruled directly for nine of those years, and died at the age of 38 without leaving any descendants. He was buried in the Chongling Mausoleum of the Western Qing Tombs.

The emperor&#x27;s life was turbulent and full of hardships. He was not originally the heir to the throne but was forcibly elevated after Emperor Tongzhi died without an heir. From a young age, he was forced to leave his home and enter the palace, where he was strictly controlled and disciplined by Cixi, enduring many hardships and sorrows. Even after he reached adulthood and began his personal rule, Cixi was unwilling to relinquish her control over state power, making him continue to be a puppet, unable to enjoy the majesty and power of a monarch. During his reign, the Qing dynasty became increasingly impoverished and weak. The Sino-French War, the First Sino-Japanese War, and the Boxer Rebellion followed one after another, causing the dynasty to cede territory and pay indemnities, losing sovereignty and humiliating the nation, leaving the people in misery. Seeing the country&#x27;s decline, Guangxu allied with intellectuals like Kang Youwei and his disciple Liang Qichao to launch the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in 1898, attempting to save and rejuvenate the nation. However, this movement threatened the position of the privileged classes of traditional Chinese society and was soon suppressed by the conservative forces led by Cixi, resulting in his confinement and loss of political power and personal freedom until his untimely death. His tragic fate is rare among emperors. Although historians do not deny the failures and limitations during his reign, he is still regarded as a relatively progressive and enlightened monarch of the dynasty. His image in historical research and literary works is also mostly positive.

==Accession to the throne and upbringing==
The Guangxu Emperor was born on 14 August 1871, receiving the name Zaitian, and was the second son of Yixuan (Prince Chun), and his primary spouse Yehenara Wanzhen, a younger sister of Empress Dowager Cixi. He was the nephew of Cixi and the grandson of the Daoguang Emperor. 

On 12 January 1875, Zaitian&#x27;s cousin, the Tongzhi Emperor, died without a son to succeed him. On that same day an imperial conference was held by the co-regents of the former emperor, the Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an and the Empress Dowager Cixi. Breaking the imperial convention that a new emperor must always be of a generation after that of the previous emperor, candidates were considered from the generation of Tongzhi. The reason for this is that the empress dowagers wanted the candidate to take the place of the Tongzhi Emperor as the successor to the Xianfeng Emperor, whose only son had been Tongzhi. 

The other proposed candidates besides Zaitian were the two sons of Prince Gong, Zaicheng and Zaiying, but they were of the same age group as the Tongzhi Emperor and were seen as having been a negative influence on him, so they were distrusted. Zaitian was younger than both and was the nephew of Cixi. His father, Prince Chun, was also more liked than Prince Gong, and was known for being a scholar and a supporter of patriotic policies. These were the factors that influenced the selection of Zaitian to become emperor. 

A decree announced on 13 January that Zaitian had been chosen as the successor to the Xianfeng Emperor. The same decree also announced that Empress Dowagers Ci&#x27;an and Cixi would be his co-regents. He ascended to the throne at the age of four, on 25 February 1875, and adopted &quot;Guangxu&quot; (meaning &quot;continuation of splendor&quot;) as his regnal name, therefore he is known as the &quot;Guangxu Emperor&quot;. His personal name Zaitian was no longer used after that point. 

Beginning in March 1876, the Guangxu Emperor was taught by Weng Tonghe, who had also been involved in the disastrous upbringing of the Tongzhi Emperor yet somehow managed to be exonerated of all possible charges, and his education was also overseen by his father, Prince Chun. The emperor was taught calligraphy, the Chinese classics (including the &quot;Four Books&quot;), and the Chinese, Mongolian, and Manchu languages. Starting in 1881 he began reading historical works, including the decrees of earlier emperors. Guangxu could work diligently and already knew some of the classics, but he was not always interested in his daily lessons. As part of the emperor&#x27;s education he was taught that his main obligation as ruler was &quot;keeping the state in order&quot; and &quot;maintaining universal peace,&quot; as stated in the Confucian classic &quot;Great Learning&quot;.

The Guangxu Emperor seemed to become a self-disciplinarian early on. In 1876 he told Weng Tonghe that he considered frugality to be more important than the accumulation of wealth, and in another instance in 1878, he insisted on walking through snow and told his servants not to clear it out of his way. He also said that he considered the Tao to be more important than his own views. But, Weng noted that the emperor sometimes had extreme mood swings and did not want to participate in their daily lessons.

Weng also instilled in the Guangxu Emperor a duty of filial piety toward the Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci&#x27;an, which, aside from being a Chinese tradition, was also because Weng owed much of his successful career to the patronage of Cixi. In 1881, when the Guangxu Emperor was nine, Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an died unexpectedly, leaving Empress Dowager Cixi as sole regent for the boy. In Weng&#x27;s diaries during those days, Guangxu was reportedly seen with swollen eyes, had poor concentration and was seeking consolation from Weng. Weng too expressed his concern that Cixi was the one who had been suffering from chronic ill health, not Ci&#x27;an. During this time, the imperial eunuchs often abused their influence over the boy emperor. The Guangxu Emperor had also reportedly begun to hold some audiences on his own as an act of necessity in the early 1880s, though this stopped in 1883 when Cixi recovered from her illness.

==Taking over the reins of power==

His reign saw the outbreak of the Sino-French War in 1884 over influence in Vietnam. By the time the war ended in 1885, the French destroyed the Chinese fleet at Fuzhou, patrolled the coast of southern China unobstructed, occupied part of Taiwan, and ended the status of Vietnam as a tributary of China. This prompted Britain to end the tributary status of Burma in 1886, which China did not oppose militarily, and encouraged Japan to do the same in Korea. The negotiations with the French were carried out by the Viceroy of Zhili, Li Hongzhang, by other ministers in Beijing, and by the head of Chinese Maritime Customs, Robert Hart. The Guangxu Emperor had not given an audience to foreign diplomats in Beijing up to this point, though in August 1886 his father Prince Chun hosted a dinner for the diplomatic corps. On 7 February 1887, the emperor was officially old enough to begin to rule in his own right, but the regency of Empress Dowager Cixi continued beyond that, and the foreign diplomats were not informed of either fact. The French minister requested an audience with the emperor twice, in November 1887 and in the spring of 1888, but this was denied both times.

In 1886, several courtiers, including Prince Chun and Weng Tonghe, had petitioned Empress Dowager Cixi to postpone her retirement from the regency. Despite Cixi&#x27;s agreement to remain as regent, that same year the Guangxu Emperor had begun to write comments on memorials to the throne. In the spring of 1887, he partook in his first field-plowing ceremony, and by the end of the year he had begun to rule under Cixi&#x27;s supervision. By the mid-1880s the Guangxu Emperor also developed the ideas that he wanted guide his rule, including preserving the wealth of the country and avoiding selfishness or arrogance. Among his predecessors, he considered the Qianlong Emperor to be a model of good governance, and often visited places that the Qianlong Emperor had spent a lot of time at. He felt a sense of responsibility for following the example set by the Qianlong Emperor. Meanwhile, Prince Chun and the Grand Council prepared for the Guangxu Emperor to begin ruling directly by taking measures to make sure that the system that existed during the regency effectively remained intact. 

Eventually, in February 1889, in preparation for Cixi&#x27;s retirement, the Guangxu Emperor was married. Much to the emperor&#x27;s dislike, Cixi selected her niece, Jingfen, to be empress. She became known as Empress Longyu. She also selected a pair of sisters, who became Consorts Jin and Zhen, to be the emperor&#x27;s concubines. 

The following week, with the Guangxu Emperor married, Cixi retired from the regency on 4 March 1889.

==Years in power==
===Early rule===

Even after the Guangxu Emperor began formal rule he found that the power structure of the Qing court still depended on Empress Dowager Cixi, and he did not know how far his own authority extended. The emperor tried to take a leading role in the government, especially after she began spending several months of the year at the Summer Palace starting from 1891, but he never became capable of skillfully managing imperial court politics. The decisions that he made and the administrative process continued to be overseen by the empress dowager. Weng Tonghe reportedly observed that while the emperor attended to day-to-day state affairs, in more difficult cases the emperor and the Grand Council sought Cixi&#x27;s advice. She also decided on appointments to the Grand Council and the Six Ministries. 

In December 1890 the emperor issued a decree stating that he wanted to have an immediate audience with the foreign diplomatic corps in Beijing and to make this an annual occurrence going forward. They presented a list of conditions for the protocol at the ceremony, and it was accepted by the Qing. The audience took place on 5 March 1891, with the Guangxu Emperor receiving the foreign ministers to China at an audience in the &quot;Pavilion of Purple Light,&quot; in what is now part of Zhongnanhai, something that had also been done by the Tongzhi Emperor in 1873. That summer, under pressure from the foreign legations and in response to revolts in the Yangtze River valley that were targeting Christian missionaries, the emperor issued an edict ordering Christians to be placed under state protection. The audience of foreign diplomats with the Gaungxu Emperor became more frequent after that. He received the new Austro-Hungarian minister in a special audience in October 1891, the British minister in December 1892, and the German and Belgian ministers in 1893.

The Guangxu Emperor followed his principle of frugality in early 1892, when he tried to implement a series of draconian measures to reduce expenditures by the Imperial Household Department, which proved to be one of his few administrative successes. This dispute over the budget continued until early 1894. But its other effects were humiliating and alienating senior Manchu officials in the bureaucracy, who remained in contact with Cixi, and reducing his potential allies at the imperial court. The Guangxu Emperor inherited the system of the Qing dynasty that had emerged in 1861, at the start of the Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign. The source of authority were the two empresses dowager, while the young emperor had a secondary role, and the princes and ministers were responsible for actually running the machinery of the government. When Empress Dowager Cixi retired, Guangxu had control over the administration of the empire and she did not interfere with his actions, but the princes and ministers advised him to bring back the old system in 1894, at the start of the tensions with Japan.

===Foreign crises===

The summer of 1894 saw the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War over influence in Korea. The Guangxu Emperor was reportedly eager for the war against Japan and became associated with the pro-war faction in the imperial court, which believed that China would easily win. This was in contrast to the Empress Dowager Cixi and Viceroy Li Hongzhang, who both wanted to reach a peaceful resolution. The conflict was also an opportunity for the emperor to make his own decisions instead of remaining influenced by the empress dowager. After the Japanese attacked and sank a Chinese warship on 25 July without any declaration of war, the ministers of the Qing emperor advised him to declare war on Japan. In that document, made on 1 August, the Guangxu Emperor accused Japan of sending armies to force the king of Korea to change his system of government and of violating international law. He also used the term &quot;dwarfs&quot; for the Japanese, an ancient Chinese derogatory term, reflecting the widespread contemptuous view of Japan that many Qing officials had.

China suffered major defeats at the Battle of Pyongyang and the Battle of the Yalu River within two days in September 1894, largely destroying the Huai Army and the Beiyang Fleet, the Qing dynasty&#x27;s best military forces. The Guangxu Emperor was angry and wanted to immediately leave the capital to personally take command of the troops at the front, but he was later talked out of it by his advisors. The emperor met with a German military advisor who had been present at the Battle of the Yalu, Constantin von Hanneken, to learn what exactly happened, suggesting that he may have not trusted his ministers to tell him the truth. He also signed edicts calling for the execution of generals who were defeated. During the war, even though the Guangxu Emperor was nominally the sovereign ruler of the Qing Empire, officials often ignored him and instead sent their memorials to Cixi for her approval. Eventually, two sets of Grand Council memoranda were created, one for the emperor and the other for the empress dowager, a practice that continued until it was rendered unnecessary by the events in the autumn of 1898. 

In February 1895, as peace negotiations with the Japanese were underway, the Guangxu Emperor spoke with his top negotiator before he met with the Japanese, Li Hongzhang, and allegedly told him during their conversation that China needed large scale reforms. In April, after the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed but before it was ratified by the Qing government, the treaty&#x27;s severe terms for China were publicized. Government bureaucrats throughout the empire urged the imperial court to reject it and continue fighting. The emperor did not want to take responsibility for ratifying the treaty, and neither did the Empress Dowager Cixi, who may have wanted to use the defeat against Japan to undermine Guangxu. He tried to shift the responsibility in an edict by asking two officials, Liu Kunyi and Wang Wenshao, to give their opinion on whether to agree to the treaty, because they had told him that the Chinese military was capable of achieving victory. Eventually the Guangxu Emperor ratified it.

The emperor and the Qing government faced further humiliation in late 1897 when the German Empire used the murders of two priests in Shandong Province as an excuse to occupy Jiaozhou Bay (including Qingdao), prompting a &quot;scramble for concessions&quot; by other foreign powers. Germany sent a naval squadron under command of the brother of Emperor Wilhelm II, the admiral Prince Heinrich, who was later received by the Qing monarch at the Summer Palace in May 1898. Germany&#x27;s example was followed by demands from Russia, Britain, France, and Japan. China&#x27;s relatively weak forces were not in a position to challenge them, and the United States, which was opposed to European concessions, was distracted by events in Cuba and the Spanish–American War. In the six months between November 1897 and May 1898 China had received unprecedented demands from foreign powers. 

After the Qing Empire&#x27;s defeat to Japan and forced agreement to the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the Guangxu Emperor reportedly expressed his wish to abdicate. He wrote that by giving away Taiwan to Japan, as the treaty required, he was going to lose the &quot;unity of the people.&quot; The emperor felt that he was unworthy of his ancestors because he failed as a leader, which was made worse after he was also forced to give concessions to the European powers in 1897–98. Luke Kwong wrote that this was part of what drove the Guangxu Emperor to begin the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform in the summer of 1898, because he saw taking radical action to revitalize the Qing dynasty as the only way to make up for his perceived failure. Already in December 1897 the emperor wrote an edict that asked bureaucrats with military knowledge to recommend reforms that could be made.

===Hundred Days&#x27; Reform===

Following the war and the scramble for concessions, there was growing support for reform in China among the gentry and the nobility in the spring of 1898. In April the emperor was presented with a memorial to the throne signed by young metropolitan officials and &quot;jinshi&quot; graduates that urged him to not trust his ministers and deal with the foreign powers on his own. In early June 1898 the grand councilor Weng Tonghe introduced the Guangxu Emperor to the reformist official Kang Youwei, and the emperor was impressed by him, especially after reading Kang&#x27;s two books about the reforms in Russia by Peter the Great and in Japan by the Meiji Emperor. He personally met with Kang on 14 June, and started issuing reform decrees on 11 June. The first order, the edict of 11 June 1898, declared the intent of the Qing emperor to pursue reform as response to calls from certain officials since the war with Japan, and asked every one of his subjects to contribute to strengthening China, a project that was going to be based on &quot;Western learning&quot; while maintaining respect for traditional morals. Guangxu also received Cixi&#x27;s approval for the edict. 

Between June and September 1898 the emperor carried out the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, aimed at a series of sweeping political, legal and social changes. The goal was to make China a modern constitutional empire, but still within the traditional framework, as with Japan&#x27;s Meiji Restoration. The emperor&#x27;s initial focus was establishing the Imperial University in Beijing and reforming the education system. The last part of his edict of 11 June instructed the Grand Council and the Zongli Yamen, the Qing dynasty&#x27;s foreign office, to establish the Imperial University right away. The Guangxu Emperor then issued edicts for a massive number of far-reaching modernizing reforms with the help of more progressive officials such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. Changes ranged from infrastructure to industry and the civil examination system. Other edicts were for the construction of the Lu-Han railway, a system of budgets similar to that of Western governments, the replacement of the Green Standard Army with a Western-style national army based on conscription, and the creation of a naval academy. Among the lesser known measures that the Guangxu Emperor wanted to take was his naval armament program, which called for China to have a navy of 21 battleships. The emperor also required court bureaucrats to read the writings of the earlier reformist official Feng Guifen and present a report on his suggestions in ten days, encouraged imperial princes to study abroad, and tried to streamline the government by firing 5,000 state employees. 

One of the early stumbling blocks for this effort happened on 15 June, when the Guangxu Emperor suddenly dismissed the grand councilor Weng Tonghe from all of his posts, even though he had been the one to draft his first reform edict. It has been debated by historians what the immediate reason for the action was, but it occurred after Weng had been a voice of caution leading up the summer of 1898, and he may have been seen by the emperor as an obstacle to his plans. The emperor was also impatient and wanted immediate results, so he may have fired him in an emotional moment. On several occasions he also tried to write his edicts in a way that would intimidate other officials, which undermined his own call for unity on the project. Overall, there was no coherent structure to the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, and the Guangxu Emperor was frantically trying to begin as many changes as he could with his edicts, causing the bureaucracy to be overwhelmed by the large number of documents being written. 
Although the decrees between June and August were largely accepted and were creating the basis for reform, starting in September they began targeting the positions of the Manchu nobility and the gentry. These were not only too sudden for a China still under significant neo-Confucian influence and other elements of traditional culture, but later came into conflict with Cixi, who held real power. Many officials, deemed useless and dismissed by the Guangxu Emperor, begged her for help. But the decisive response by Empress Dowager Cixi was caused by the accusation from the official Yang Chongyi that the Guangxu Emperor had committed treason by inviting the former Japanese prime minister Ito Hirobumi to advise him (Ito was in China at the time to meet with the emperor). Yang claimed that Guangxu had done this on the advice of Kang Youwei and the wanted revolutionary Sun Yat-sen. Guangxu was unable to effectively defend himself to Cixi from Yang&#x27;s accusation. Both sides began plotting to take action against each other. 

Some of the reformers around the emperor asked Yuan Shikai to use the Beiyang Army to arrest Cixi and to execute Ronglu, a member of the conservative faction who had been appointed to command the military forces in Zhili earlier. According to one account, this was a decree that was issued by the Guangxu Emperor. But Yuan later said that the schemers could not convince him that it was really from the emperor, and when Yuan met with him on 20 September, Guangxu did not say anything about it to Yuan. He then left the emperor to meet with Ronglu and told him about the plot by the reformers, also telling him the emperor had nothing to do with it. Ronglu then met with Cixi and other ministers and princes, and started taking action. On the 21st the Guangxu Emperor was detained and met with Empress Dowager Cixi. The following day, he issued a decree that asked Cixi to take control of the government, who proceeded to remove the reform-minded officials and replaced them with conservative loyalists. An edict on 26 September undid some of the more radical changes the emperor had made, while keeping in place those reforms that did not go directly against Qing tradition.

Lei Chia-sheng (雷家聖), a Taiwanese history professor, proposes an alternative view: that the Guangxu Emperor might have been led into a trap by the reformists led by Kang Youwei, who in turn was in Lei&#x27;s opinion tricked by British missionary Timothy Richard and former Japanese prime minister Itō Hirobumi into agreeing to appoint Itō as one of many foreign advisors. British ambassador Claude MacDonald claimed that the reformists had actually &quot;much injured&quot; the modernization of China. Lei claims that Cixi learned of the plot and decided to put an end to it to prevent China from coming under foreign control.

==Under house arrest after 1898==

The Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s duties after 1898 became rather limited. The emperor was effectively removed from power as emperor (despite keeping the title), but he did retain some status.

The emperor was kept informed of state affairs, reading them with Cixi prior to audiences, and was also present at audiences, sitting on a stool to Cixi&#x27;s left hand while Cixi occupied the main throne. He discharged his ceremonial duties, such as offering sacrifices during ceremonies, but never ruled alone again.

In 1898, shortly after the collapse of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s health began to decline, prompting Cixi to name Pujun, a son of the emperor&#x27;s cousin, the reactionary Prince Duan, as heir presumptive. Pujun and his father were removed from their positions after the Boxer Rebellion. He was examined by a physician at the French Legation and diagnosed with chronic nephritis; he was also discovered to be impotent at the time.

During the Boxer Rebellion, Emperor Guangxu fiercely opposed the idea of using usurpers as a means to counter foreign invasion. On 14 August 1900, the Guangxu Emperor, along with Cixi, Empress Longyu and some other court officials, fled from Beijing as the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance marched on the capital to relieve the legations that had been besieged during the Boxer Rebellion.

Returning to the capital on 7 January 1902, after the withdrawal of the foreign powers, the Guangxu Emperor spent the next few years working in his isolated palace with watches and clocks, which had been a childhood fascination, some say in an effort to pass the time until Cixi&#x27;s death. He also read widely and spent time learning English from Cixi&#x27;s Western-educated lady-in-waiting, Yu Deling. His relationship with Empress Longyu, Cixi&#x27;s niece (and the Emperor&#x27;s own first cousin), also improved to some extent.

==Death==
The Guangxu Emperor died on 14 November 1908, a day before Cixi&#x27;s death, at the age of 37. For a long time, there were several theories about the emperor&#x27;s death, none of which was accepted fully by historians. Most were inclined to believe that Cixi, herself very ill, poisoned the Guangxu Emperor because she was afraid he would reverse her policies after her death. &quot;China Daily&quot; quoted a historian, Dai Yi, who speculated that Cixi might have known of her imminent death and worried that the Guangxu Emperor would continue his reforms after her death. Another theory is that the Guangxu Emperor was poisoned by Yuan Shikai, who knew that if the emperor were to come to power again, Yuan would likely be executed for treason. There were no reliable sources to prove who murdered the Guangxu Emperor.

The medical records kept by the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s physician show the emperor suffered from &quot;spells of violent stomachaches&quot; and that his face had turned blue, typical symptoms of arsenic poisoning. To dispel persistent rumours that the emperor had been poisoned, the Qing imperial court produced documents and doctors&#x27; records suggesting that the Guangxu Emperor died from natural causes, but these did not allay suspicion.

On 4 November 2008, forensic tests revealed that the level of arsenic in the emperor&#x27;s remains was 2,000 times higher than that of ordinary people. Scientists concluded that the poison could only have been administered in a high dose at one time.

The Guangxu Emperor was succeeded by Cixi&#x27;s choice as heir, his nephew Puyi, who took the regnal name &quot;Xuantong&quot;. In January 1912, the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s consort, who had become Empress Dowager Longyu, placed her seal on the abdication decree, ending two thousand years of imperial rule in China. Longyu died childless in 1913.

After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911–1912, the Chinese Republic funded the construction of the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s mausoleum in the Western Qing Tombs. The tomb was robbed during the Chinese Civil War and the underground palace (burial chamber) is now open to the public.

==Appraisal==
In 1912, Sun Yat-sen praised the Guangxu Emperor for his educational reform package that allowed China to learn more about Western culture. After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, historian Fan Wenlan (范文瀾) called the Guangxu Emperor &quot;a Manchu noble who could accept Western ideas&quot;. Some historians believe that the Guangxu Emperor was the first Chinese leader to implement modernizing reforms and capitalism. Imperial power in the Qing dynasty saw its nadir under Guangxu, and he was the only Qing emperor to have been put under house arrest during his own reign.

== Family ==


The Guangxu Emperor had one empress and two consorts in total. The emperor was forced by Empress Dowager Cixi to marry her niece (his cousin) Jingfen, who was two years his senior. Jingfen&#x27;s father, Guixiang (Cixi&#x27;s younger brother), and Cixi selected her to be the Guangxu Emperor&#x27;s wife in order to strengthen the power of their own family. After the marriage, Jingfen was made empress and was granted the honorific title of &quot;Longyu&quot; (; ) after the death of her husband. However, the Guangxu Emperor detested his wife and spent most of his time with his favourite concubine, Consort Zhen (better known as the &quot;Pearl Consort&quot;). Rumours allege that in 1900, Consort Zhen was drowned by being thrown into a well on Cixi&#x27;s order after she begged Empress Dowager Cixi to let the Guangxu Emperor stay in Beijing for negotiations with the foreign powers. That incident happened when the Imperial Family was preparing to leave the Forbidden City due to the occupation of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. Like his predecessor, the Tongzhi Emperor, the Guangxu Emperor died without issue. After his death in 1908, Empress Dowager Longyu ruled in cooperation with Zaifeng.

<doc id="265940" wikidata="Q318811" url="?curid=265940" title="Tongzhi Emperor">
<text>The Tongzhi Emperor (27 April 1856 – 12 January 1875), also known by his temple name Emperor Muzong of Qing, personal name Zaichun, was the tenth emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the eighth Qing emperor to rule over China proper. His reign, which effectively lasted through his adolescence, was largely overshadowed by the rule of Empress Dowager Cixi. Although he had little influence over state affairs, the events of his reign gave rise to what historians call the &quot;Tongzhi Restoration&quot;, an unsuccessful modernization program.

The only surviving son of the Xianfeng Emperor, he ascended the throne at the age of five under a regency headed by his biological mother Empress Dowager Cixi and his legal mother Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an. The Self-Strengthening Movement, in which Qing officials pursued radical institutional reforms following the disasters of the Opium Wars and the Taiping Rebellion, began during his reign. The Tongzhi Emperor assumed personal rule over the Qing government in 1873, but he had no interest in affairs of state and immediately came into conflict with his ministers. He was outmaneuvered by the dowager empresses. 

He died of smallpox at the age of 18 in 1875, following unsuccessful medical treatments; his death without a male heir created a succession crisis. In contravention to Qing&#x27;s dynastic custom, his double first cousin assumed the throne as the Guangxu Emperor.

==Life==
The only surviving son of the Xianfeng Emperor and Empress Dowager Cixi, the Tongzhi Emperor was namesake to the attempted political reform initiated by his mother, called the Tongzhi Restoration. His era name was originally proposed as &quot;Qixiang&quot; (祺祥; Manchu: &quot;Fengšengge sabingga&quot;), but this was later changed upon his succession to &quot;Tongzhi&quot;. The era name means &#x27;order and prosperity&#x27; coming from the Confucian teaching that &quot;there are many ways of being a good government, and they can all be summarized as order and prosperity&quot;.

The Tongzhi Emperor became emperor at the age of five upon the death of his father, the Xianfeng Emperor. His father&#x27;s choice of a regent, Sushun, was removed in favor of a partnership between his mother Empress Dowager Cixi and Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an.

While there had most likely been hopes that the Tongzhi Emperor would become a successful leader like the Kangxi Emperor (who ascended the throne as a child in 1661), those hopes would soon be disappointed, as the Tongzhi Emperor grew up to become an obstinate and dissolute young man who also expressed his dissatisfaction with his mother Empress Cixi.

In the fall of 1872, he married Empress Xiaozheyi and two official concubines. The Tongzhi Emperor apparently had wanted to take up power immediately, prompting a quarrel at court regarding the dismantling of the regency and the timing of it. However, the two empresses dowager stuck by the intended date of February 23, 1873.


The day after the Tongzhi Emperor took power, foreigners requested an audience with him. The request precipitated a sharp disagreement between the ministers at the foreign legations, who made it clear that they would not perform the ritual kowtow to the emperor, and the Zongli Yamen (foreign affairs ministry), regarding the protocol to be observed. The Qing government was also loath to hold the audience within the confines of the Forbidden City, eventually settling on the &quot;Pavilion of Purple Light&quot; at one of the lakeside palaces to the west of the Forbidden City, which is now part of Zhongnanhai. The audience was finally held on 29 June 1873. After the audience, however, the foreign representatives made clear their annoyance at being received in a hall initially used by the Qing emperors to receive envoys of tributary states.

In the fall of 1874, the Tongzhi Emperor got into a clash with his ministers, which included his two uncles, Prince Gong and Prince Chun, largely over the emperor&#x27;s plans to rebuild the Old Summer Palace at a time in which the empire was bankrupt, and over his dissolute behavior. The emperor reacted by firing the ministers, but Empresses Dowager Ci&#x27;an and Cixi intervened, and he had them reinstated. That December, it was announced that he was ill with smallpox, and the Empress Dowagers resumed the regency. He died on 12 January 1875, leaving no sons to succeed him.

The Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s death left the court in a succession crisis as he was childless. Eventually, the empresses dowager designated the Tongzhi Emperor&#x27;s three-year-old cousin, Zaitian, as the heir to the throne. Zaitian was biologically Prince Chun&#x27;s son, but was symbolically adopted as the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s son to make him eligible to succeed the Tongzhi Emperor. Zaitian was thus enthroned as the Guangxu Emperor, with Empresses Dowager Ci&#x27;an and Cixi resuming their roles as regents. Empress Alute, Tongzhi&#x27;s wife, refused to eat after his death and died seventy days after he died in an act of marital piety.

==The Self-Strengthening Movement==


The inspiration for the future Self-Strengthening Movement arose from the notion that China&#x27;s defense in the face of war and rebellion must come from within, as the superior man strengthens himself under imperative of Heaven&#x27;s robust action. The costs of war and rebellion dictated that the Qing dynasty undertake vigorous measures to ensure its survival. Moreover, the very survival of China itself was now at stake.

Self-strengthening efforts evolved in a succession of stages over a period of almost half a century. In 1840 Imperial Commissioner Lin Zexu, impressed by the power of British warships in the initial battles of the Opium War, advocated adoption of Western naval technology. The paddle-wheel steamer &quot;Nemsis&quot; had run circles around cumbersome Chinese war junks. Some Chinese at first believed the paddle-wheels were powered by men inside the ship, but soon came to appreciate the power of steam, Commissioner Lin was the first self-strengthener.

Self-strengthening enterprises, including arsenals, shipyards, and technical schools, were now established in the principal treaty ports where access to Western technology was most direct. By 1860, the overwhelming bulk of the Chinese scholarly class had become cognizant of the enormity of changes that were taking place due to the increasingly prevalent Western presence in China. They now proclaimed that change was irresistible and advocated for deeper studies of Western technology. Many reforms were proposed and implemented such as the Self-Strengthening Movement, but ultimately the failure of reforms was due to multiple factors such as political machinations.

<text>The Xianfeng Emperor (17 July 1831 – 22 August 1861), also known by his temple name Emperor Wenzong of Qing, personal name Yizhu, was the ninth emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the seventh Qing emperor to rule over China proper. During his reign, the Qing dynasty experienced several wars and rebellions including the Taiping Rebellion, the Nian Rebellion, and the Second Opium War. He was the last Chinese emperor to exercise sole power.

The fourth son of the Daoguang Emperor, he assumed the throne in 1850 and inherited an empire in crisis. A few months after his ascension, the Taiping Rebellion broke out in southern China and rapidly spread, culminating in the fall of Nanjing in 1853. Contemporaneously, the Nian Rebellion began in the north, followed by ethnic uprisings (the Miao Rebellion and the Panthay Rebellion) in the south. The revolts ravaged large parts of the country, caused millions of deaths and would not be quelled until well into the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s successor. Qing defeat during the first phase of the Second Opium War led to the Treaty of Tientsin and the Treaty of Aigun, the latter of which resulted in the cession of much of Manchuria to the Russian Empire. Negotiations broke down and hostilities resumed soon after, and in 1860 Anglo-French forces entered Beijing and burned the Old Summer Palace. The Xianfeng Emperor was forced to flee for the imperial estate at Jehol, and the Convention of Peking was negotiated in his absence.

His health was already in rapid decline in the face of mounting Qing losses. He died in 1861 in Jehol at the age of 30 and was succeeded by his six-year-old son, who assumed the throne as the Tongzhi Emperor. On his deathbed, the Xianfeng Emperor appointed eight men to a regency council to assist his young successor. A few months later, Empress Dowager Cixi and Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an along with Prince Gong instigated the Xinyou Coup and ousted the regents. Cixi ultimately rose to sole power and consolidated control over the Qing government.

== Family and early life ==
Yizhu was born in 1831 at the Old Summer Palace, eight kilometres northwest of Beijing. He was from the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan, and was the fourth son of the Daoguang Emperor. His mother was the Noble Consort Quan, of the Manchu Niohuru clan, who was made Empress in 1834, and is known posthumously as Empress Xiaoquancheng. Yizhu was reputed to have an ability in literature and administration which surpassed most of his brothers, which impressed his father, who therefore decided to make him his successor.

== Early reign ==

Yizhu succeeded the throne in 1850, at age 19, and was a relatively young emperor. He inherited a dynasty that faced not only internal but also foreign challenges. Yizhu&#x27;s reign title, &quot;Xianfeng&quot;, which means &quot;universal prosperity&quot;, did not reflect the situation. In 1850, the first of a series of popular rebellions began that would nearly destroy the Qing dynasty. The Taiping Rebellion began in December 1850, when Hong Xiuquan, a Hakka leader of a syncretic Christian sect, defeated local forces sent to disperse his followers. Hong then proclaimed the establishment of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the rebellion spread to several provinces with amazing speed. The following year, the Nian Rebellion started in North China. Unlike the Christian-influenced Taiping rebels, the Nian movement lacked a clear political program, but they became a serious threat to the Qing capital, Beijing, with the mobility of their cavalry-based armies. The Qing imperial forces suffered repeated defeats at the hands of both rebel movements.

== Rebellions and wars ==
In 1853, the Taiping rebels captured Nanjing and for a while it seemed that Beijing would fall next; but the Taiping northern expedition was defeated and the situation stabilized. The Xianfeng Emperor dispatched several prominent mandarins, such as Zeng Guofan and the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen, to crush the rebellions, but they only obtained limited success. The biggest revolt of the Miao people against Chinese rule in history started in 1854, and ravaged the region until finally put down in 1873. In 1856, an attempt to regain Nanjing was defeated and the Panthay Rebellion broke out in Yunnan.

Meanwhile, an initially minor incident on the coasts triggered the Second Opium War. The British and French, after engaging in a number of minor military confrontations on the coast near Tianjin, attempted to start negotiations with the Qing government. The Xianfeng Emperor believed in Chinese superiority and would not agree to any demands from the European powers. He delegated Prince Gong for several negotiations but relations broke down completely when a British diplomat, Sir Harry Parkes, was taken hostage by Chinese forces during negotiations on 18 September.

Anglo-French forces clashed with Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s Mongol cavalry on 18 September near Zhangjiawan before proceeding toward the outskirts of Beijing for a decisive battle in Tongzhou District, Beijing. On 21 September, at the Battle of Palikao, Sengge Rinchen&#x27;s 10,000 troops, including his elite Mongol cavalrymen, were completely annihilated after several doomed frontal charges against the concentrated firepower of the Anglo-French forces, which entered Beijing on 6 October. On 18 October 1860, British and French forces sacked and burnt Old Summer Palace. Upon learning about this news, the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s health quickly deteriorated.

During the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s reign, China lost part of Manchuria to the Russian Empire. In 1858, according to the Treaty of Aigun, the territory between the Stanovoy Range and the Amur River was ceded to Russia, and in 1860, according to the Treaty of Beijing, the same thing happened also to the area east of the Ussuri River. After that treaty, the Russians founded the city of Vladivostok in the area they had annexed.

While negotiations with British, French and Russian officials were being held, the Xianfeng Emperor and his imperial entourage fled to Jehol province in the name of conducting the annual imperial hunting expedition. As his health worsened, the emperor&#x27;s ability to govern also deteriorated, and competing ideologies in court led to the formation of two distinct factions — one led by the senior official Sushun and the princes Zaiyuan and Duanhua, and the other led by Noble Consort Yi, who was supported by the general Ronglu and the Bannermen of the Yehe Nara clan.

==Death==
The Xianfeng Emperor died on 22 August 1861, from a short life of overindulgence, at the Chengde Mountain Resort, 230 kilometres northeast of Beijing. His successor was his surviving five-year-old son, Zaichun. A day before his death, the Xianfeng Emperor had summoned Sushun and his supporters to his bedside and gave them an imperial edict that dictated the power structure during his son&#x27;s minority. The edict appointed eight men – Zaiyuan, Duanhua, Jingshou, Sushun, Muyin, Kuang Yuan, Du Han and Jiao Youying – as an eight-member regency council to aid Zaichun, who was later enthroned as the Tongzhi Emperor. Xianfeng gave the eight men the power of regency, but their edicts would have to be endorsed by Noble Consort Yi and Empress Consort Zhen. By tradition, after the death of an emperor, the emperor&#x27;s body was to be accompanied to the capital by the regents. Noble Consort Yi and Empress Consort Zhen, who were now known as Empress Dowagers Cixi and Ci&#x27;an travelled ahead to Beijing and planned a coup with Prince Gong that ousted the eight regents. Empress Dowager Cixi then effectively ruled China over the subsequent 47 years as a regent.

The Xianfeng Emperor was interred in the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometres/75 miles east of Beijing, in the Ding (定; lit. &quot;Quietude&quot;) mausoleum complex.

==Legacy==
The Qing dynasty continued to decline during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor. Rebellions in the country, which began the first year of his reign, would not be quelled until well into the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor and resulted in millions of deaths. The Xianfeng Emperor also had to deal with the British and French and their ever-growing appetite to expand trade further into China. The Xianfeng Emperor, like his father, the Daoguang Emperor, understood very little about Europeans and their mindset. He viewed non-Chinese as inferior and regarded the repeated requests by the Europeans for the establishment of diplomatic relations as an offence. When the Europeans introduced the long-held concept of an exchanged consular relationship, the Xianfeng Emperor quickly rebuffed the idea. At the time of his death, he had not met with any foreign dignitary.

Despite his tumultuous decade of reign, the Xianfeng Emperor was commonly seen as the last Qing emperor to have held paramount authority, ruling in his own right. The reigns of his son and subsequent successors were overseen by regents, a trend present until the fall of the Qing dynasty.

<doc id="265943" wikidata="Q245260" url="?curid=265943" title="Conurbation">
<text>A conurbation is a region consisting of a number of metropolises, cities, large towns, and other urban areas which, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a urbanised area in which transportation has developed to link areas. They create a single urban labour market or travel to work area.

Conurbations often emerged in coal-mining regions during the period of the Industrial Revolution.
Patrick Geddes coined the term in his book &quot;Cities in Evolution&quot; (1915). He drew attention to the ability of the new technology at the time of electric power and motorised transport to allow cities to spread and agglomerate together, and gave as examples &quot;Midlandton&quot; in England, the Ruhr in Germany, Randstad in the Netherlands, and the Northeastern Seaboard in the United States.

For census purposes, the term as described is used in Britain, whereas in the United States a related concept of metropolitan area is used instead. Each polycentric &quot;metropolitan area&quot; may have its own common designation such as San Francisco Bay Area or the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Internationally the term &quot;urban agglomeration&quot; is often used to convey a similar meaning to &quot;conurbation&quot;.

A conurbation is different from a megalopolis in that the urban areas of a megalopolis are close but not physically contiguous, and labor markets have not yet merged. The region structure should also be contrasted with a megacity, as a megacity is hierarchical with a dominant urban core, whereas a conurbation is polycentric and no single urban centre has the dominant role over all other centres.

===United Kingdom===
Industrial and housing growth in the United Kingdom during the 19th and early 20th centuries produced many conurbations. Greater London is by far the largest urban area and is usually counted as a conurbation in statistical terms, but differs from the others in the degree to which it is focused on a single central area. In the mid-1950s the Green Belt was introduced to stem the further urbanisation of the countryside in South East England.

The list below shows the most populous urban areas in the UK as defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Different organisations define conurbations in the UK differently for example, the Liverpool–Manchester or the Manchester–Liverpool conurbation is defined as one conurbation by AESOP in a comparison report published by the University of Manchester in 2005 found here. The Liverpool–Manchester Conurbation has a population of 5.68 million.

Urban population rate: 89% (2015)

Urban population rate: 71% (2015)
==North America==

===Canada===
====Golden Horseshoe (Ontario)====
The Golden Horseshoe is a densely populated and industrialized region centred on the west end of Lake Ontario in Southern Ontario, Canada. The largest cities in the region are Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Hamilton, Oakville, Burlington, St. Catharines, and Niagara Falls. If metropolitan areas (which are somewhat distinct from the core urban area of the Golden Horseshoe by about 30 to 50 km of less developed and semi-rural land) are included (similar to Combined Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States as defined by United States Office of Management and Budget), the total population is 8.8 million people. This is slightly over a quarter (25.6%) of the population of Canada, approximately 75% of Ontario&#x27;s population, and one of the largest metropolitan areas in North America.

The larger area is named the Greater Golden Horseshoe and includes the metropolitan areas of Kitchener (including adjacent cities it is often referred to as Waterloo Region), Barrie, Guelph, Peterborough, and Brantford. The Greater Golden Horseshoe is also part of the Windsor-Quebec Corridor and its southeastern boundary is across the Niagara River from the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area in the United States.

====Greater Montreal (Quebec)====
Greater Montreal is Canada&#x27;s second-largest conurbation. Statistics Canada defines the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) as having and a population of 3,824,221 as of 2011, which represents almost half of the population of the province of Quebec. Slightly smaller, there are 82 municipalities grouped under the Montreal Metropolitan Community to coordinate issues such as land planning, transportation, and economic development.

====Lower Mainland (British Columbia)====

British Columbia&#x27;s Lower Mainland is the most populated area in Western Canada. It consists of many mid-sized contiguous urban areas, including Vancouver, North Vancouver (city and district municipality), West Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Richmond, Surrey, and Coquitlam, among others. The Lower Mainland population is around 2.5 million (as of 2011) and the area has one of the highest growth rates on the continent of up to 9.2 percent from the 2006 census.

====Ottawa-Gatineau / National Capital Region====
The National Capital Region (NCR) is made up of the capital, Ottawa, and neighbouring Gatineau which is located across the Ottawa River. As Ottawa is in Ontario and Gatineau is in Quebec, it is a unique conurbation. Federal government buildings are located in both cities and many workers live in one city and work in the other. The National Capital Region consists of an area of 5,319 square kilometres that straddles the boundary between the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The area of the National Capital Region is very similar to that of the Ottawa-Gatineau Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) although the National Capital Region contains a number of small neighbouring communities that are not contained within the CMA. When all the communities are included, the population of the area is about 1,500,000. Ottawa-Gatineau is the only CMA in the nation to fall within two provinces and is the fourth largest.

===Mexico===
====Mexico City (CDMX)====

The &quot;CDMX&quot; is the most densely populated center in North America. Greater Mexico City refers to the conurbation around Mexico City, officially called Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area (Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México), constituted by Mexico City itself composed of 16 Municipalities—and 41 adjacent municipalities of the states of Mexico and Hidalgo. However, for normative purposes, Greater Mexico City most commonly refers to the Metropolitan Area of the Valley of Mexico (Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México) an agglomeration that incorporates 18 additional municipalities. As of 2019 an estimated 27,782,000 people lived in Greater Mexico City, making it the largest metropolitan area in North America. It is surrounded by thin strips of highlands which separate it from other adjacent metropolitan areas, of which the biggest are Puebla, Toluca, and Cuernavaca-Cuautla. Together those areas make up the Mexico City megalopolis.

==== Guadalajara Metropolitan Area (Zona Metropolitana de Guadalajara) ====
The Guadalajara conurbation in the state of Jalisco (colloquially known as the City of Guadalajara, as that is the state capital and most populous of the cities) consists of seven municipalities: Guadalajara, Zapopan, Tlaquepaque, Tonalá, El Salto, Zapotlanejo, and Tlajomulco de Zúñiga. Officially two other cities (Juanacatlán and Ixtlahuacán de los Membrillos) are also considered part of the Metropolitan Area, although they are not contiguous with the other seven. The area had an estimated population of 4 500 000 in 2010, spread over a combined area of .

===United States===
====Puerto Rico====

The Caribbean area has a conurbation in Puerto Rico consisting of San Juan, Bayamón, Guaynabo, Carolina, Canóvanas, Trujillo Alto, Toa Alta, Toa Baja, Cataño, and Caguas. The area is colloquially known as the &quot;Área Metropolitana&quot;, and houses around 1.4 million inhabitants spread over an area of approximately 396.61 square kilometers (153.13 sq mi), making it the largest city in the Caribbean by area.

====New York Tri-state area====
One example of a conurbation is the expansive concept of the New York metropolitan area (the Tri-state region) centered on New York City, including 30 counties spread among New York State, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, with an estimated population of 21,961,994 in 2007. Approximately one-fifteenth of all U.S. residents live in the Greater New York City area, the world&#x27;s most brightly illuminated urban conurbation and largest urban landmass. This conurbation is the result of several central cities whose urban areas have merged.

====Greater Boston Area====

Holding a population of 7,427,336 as of 2005, the Combined Statistical Area including Greater Boston consists of Boston proper and a collection of distinct but intertwined cities including Providence, Rhode Island; Worcester, Massachusetts; and Manchester, New Hampshire. Most importantly, the cities that compose the Greater Boston CSA are interlinked by heavy public transportation infrastructure, maintain continuously urban interstices, and hold mutual commuting patterns.

====San Francisco Bay Area====
Another conurbation is the combination of the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and several minor urban centers with a combined population of nearly 8 million people, known as the San Francisco Bay Area.

====Greater Los Angeles Area====

The Greater Los Angeles Area consists of the merging of several distinct central cities and counties including Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. The area is also often referred to simply as southern California or colloquially as SoCal (a larger region which includes San Diego). In 2016, Southern California had a population of 23,800,500, making it slightly larger than the New York Tri-State Area, and is projected to remain so due to a faster growth rate. But because southern California is not yet a recognized Combined Statistical Area by the United States Office of Management and Budget, the New York Tri-State Area officially remains the nation&#x27;s largest as of now.

====Baltimore–Washington Area====

The traditionally separate metropolitan areas of Baltimore and Washington, D.C. have shared suburbs and a continuous urbanization between the two central cities (Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area).

====San Diego–Tijuana====
The largest conurbation between the United States and Mexico is San Diego–Tijuana. It includes the two countries&#x27; busiest border crossing and a shared economy.

====Dallas–Fort Worth====
Three large cities—Dallas, Fort Worth, and Arlington—make up this area. Each city is linked by bordering city limits or suburbs. The area is also known as the Dallas–Fort Worth &quot;metroplex&quot;, so called because it has more than one principal anchor city of nearly equal size or importance, and is included in the emerging megalopolis known as the Texas Triangle. According to &quot;Texas Monthly&quot;, the term is a portmanteau of the terms &quot;metropolitan&quot; and &quot;complex&quot; and was created by a local advertising agency, TracyLocke. The North Texas Commission trademarked the term &quot;Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex&quot; in 1972 as a replacement for the previously ubiquitous term &quot;North Texas&quot;. Urban areas with smaller secondary anchor cities (including Mexico City, New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, and Phoenix) are not considered to be conurbations.

====Detroit–Windsor====
The major U.S. city of Detroit lies immediately across the Detroit River from Windsor, Ontario in Canada. In many respects—economically, historically, culturally, socially, and geographically—Windsor is more a part of Metro Detroit than of Ontario. The two cities and their surrounding suburbs are commonly referred to collectively as the Detroit–Windsor area. The Detroit-Windsor border is the largest commercial border crossing in North America and the busiest between the two countries.

====South Florida====

The entire tri-county area also known as the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area is now continuously urbanized along a roughly length of the Florida east coast as well as extending inland and continuing south of Miami as far as Florida City. Although this is generally all referred to as a single metropolitan area, not a conurbation, it is sometimes broken up into the Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach metros.

====Minneapolis–St. Paul====

Minneapolis–Saint Paul is the most populous urban area in the state of Minnesota, and is composed of 182 cities and townships built around the Mississippi, Minnesota, and St. Croix rivers. The area is also nicknamed the Twin Cities for its two largest cities, Minneapolis, with the highest population and Saint Paul, the state capital.

==== Quad Cities ====
The Quad Cities is a metropolitan area located along the border of Illinois and Iowa. Straddling the Mississippi River as it flows west, the area once known as the &quot;Tri Cities&quot; consists of a handful of larger cities and smaller municipalities that have grown together. The largest cities include Rock Island, Moline, and East Moline in Illinois as well as Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa.

==== Stamford-Hartford ====
Hartford is the capital city of Connecticut and fourth largest by population. Together, with Waterbury, New Haven, Bridgeport, and Stamford, these five cities form a conurbation, as people continue moving into the suburbs of these cities from rural areas, and the Boston and New York City metropolitan areas. Majority of Connecticut&#x27;s growth in the last decade was centered in and around these five cities. Combined, the population exceeds 1 million.

====The Valley of the Sun====

Phoenix is the capital and most populous city in Arizona. It is the center of The Valley of the Sun which is recognized by the United States Census Bureau as Chandler, Mesa, and Phoenix in the MSA. Other communities in the metropolitan area include Scottsdale, Glendale, Tempe, Gilbert, and Peoria.

====The Front Range Urban Corridor====
Denver is the capital and most populous city in Colorado, as well as the most populous municipality in the Front Range Urban Corridor. This conurbation encompasses 18 counties in Colorado and Wyoming and had an estimated population of 4,976,781 in 2018, an increase of 14.84% since the 2010 United States Census.

==Oceania==
===Australia===
====Albury-Wodonga====
Albury and Wodonga are cross border cities which are geographically separated by the Murray River. Albury on the north of the river is part of New South Wales, while Wodonga on the south bank is in Victoria. In the early 1970s Albury-Wodonga was selected as the primary focus of the Whitlam government&#x27;s scheme to arrest the uncontrolled growth of Australia&#x27;s large metropolitan areas (in particular Sydney and Melbourne) by encouraging decentralisation. The two cities combine to form an urban area with an estimated population of 93,603.

====Canberra-Queanbeyan====
A cross border built-up area comprising the nation&#x27;s capital Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory and the city of Queanbeyan in New South Wales, which is considered by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to have a single labour market.

====Newcastle, Sydney, and Wollongong====

This conurbation in New South Wales extends from Newcastle and surrounding satellite towns of the Hunter Valley through the Central Coast. It is broken up only by waterways and national parks, through to the greater Sydney metropolitan area and the Wollongong urban area. The total length from the top to the bottom of the conurbation is around 270 km with a population of just over 6 million people.

Transport is linked throughout the region by motorways, the M1, M2, M4, M5, M7, M8, M15 and M31. An extensive public transport network allows for commuting for work or services across and between multiple distinct but joined centres, with NSW TrainLink&#x27;s intercity network serving Sydney, the Central Coast, Newcastle, the Hunter Valley and the Illawarra.

Plans for making Wollongong, Sydney and Newcastle a single city have been around since the 1960s. A report titled &quot;The Committee for Sydney&quot; contains a chapter called &quot;The Sandstone Mega-Region, Uniting Newcastle, the Central Coast, Sydney, Wollongong&quot; (since all of the cities are in a geological region called the Sydney Basin, which is made up of Sydney sandstone). The report says that the link would benefit the &quot;six cities&quot; within the region, which are: Illawarra and Wollongong, the Western City (Greater Western Sydney), the Central City (Parramatta), the Eastern City (Sydney central business district, eastern suburbs, and Northern Sydney), the Central Coast (Gosford) and Newcastle (including Lake Macquarie).

====Greater Perth====
The Perth Metropolitan Region, and Peel regions form a continuous urban area in Western Australia more than 130 km (80 miles) long, on a north–south axis. It is sometimes known as Greater Perth and has a population of more than 2.3 million (2023). Introduction of the Mandurah railway line in 2007 made it possible for commuters to travel the 70 km (43.5 mi) from Mandurah to Perth in 51 minutes.

====South East Queensland====
A built-up area 200 kilometres long which is centred on Brisbane, includes the local government areas (LGAs) of Gold Coast, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay, Redland City, Sunshine Coast, Noosa Shire, and Tweed Heads, New South Wales. This area is served by a single public transport network, Translink.

Broader definitions of South East Queensland are also used, including the separate built-up area of Toowoomba (140 kilometres; 87 miles west of Brisbane), which is not part of the Translink network. Expansive definitions of South East Queensland give it a population of more than 3.4 million people (2014), covers 22,420 square kilometres (8,660 sq mi), incorporates ten LGAs, and extends 240 kilometres (150 mi) from Noosa in the north to the Gold Coast (some sources include Tweed Heads).

====Greater Darwin====
The Greater Darwin metropolitan area is a built-up urban area in the Northern Territory that spans across two cities: Darwin (the capital of the Northern Territory) and Palmerston (Darwin&#x27;s satellite city). It lies within three local government areas: the City of Darwin, Litchfield Municipality and the City of Palmerston.

===New Zealand===
In 2010 Auckland became a unitary authority encompassing seven former city and district councils including Auckland City, Manukau City, North Shore City and Waitakere City as well as a number of smaller towns, rural area and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf. Auckland Council is the largest council in Australasia and the region has a population of 1,529,300, being almost 33% of the total population of New Zealand. The entire urban area rather than the constituent administrative city was often referred to as &quot;Auckland&quot; by New Zealanders long before formal recognition.

The Wellington Metropolitan Area compromises the four cities of Wellington City, Porirua and the cities of Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt, together known as Hutt Valley. The Wellington Metropolitan Area is the second largest urban population in New Zealand with a population of 440,900 as of the 2023 census (or 550,500 if the Wairarapa region is included), followed by Christchurch City at 396,200.

==South America==

===Argentina===
* Greater Buenos Aires (12.046.799) – Greater La Plata (694.253) – Zárate / Campana

===Brazil===
The entire Rio–São Paulo area is also sometimes considered a conurbation, and plans are in the works to connect the cities with a high-speed rail. However the government of Brazil does not consider this area a single unit for statistical purposes, and population data may not be reliable.

<doc id="265947" wikidata="Q334351" url="?curid=265947" title="Daoguang Emperor">
<text>The Daoguang Emperor (16 September 1782 – 26 February 1850), also known by his temple name Emperor Xuanzong of Qing, personal name Mianning, was the eighth emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the sixth Qing emperor to rule over China proper. His reign was marked by &quot;external disaster and internal rebellion&quot;. These include the First Opium War and the beginning of the Taiping Rebellion which nearly brought down the dynasty. The historian Jonathan Spence characterizes the Daoguang Emperor as a &quot;well meaning but ineffective man&quot; who promoted officials who &quot;presented a purist view even if they had nothing to say about the domestic and foreign problems surrounding the dynasty&quot;.

== Early years ==
The Daoguang Emperor was born in the Forbidden City, Beijing, in 1782, and was given the name Mianning (). It was later changed to Minning () when he became emperor. The first character of his private name was changed from &quot;Mian&quot; to &quot;Min&quot; to avoid the relatively common character &quot;Mian&quot;. This novelty was introduced by his grandfather, the reigning Qianlong Emperor, who thought it was inappropriate to use a common character in the emperor&#x27;s private name due to the longstanding practice of naming taboo.

Mianning was the second son of Prince Yongyan, the 15th son and heir of the Qianlong Emperor. Even though he was Yongyan&#x27;s second son, he was first in line after Prince Yongyan to his grandfather&#x27;s throne. This was because according to the &quot;dishu&quot; system, his mother, Lady Hitara, was Yongyan&#x27;s primary spouse whereas his elder brother was born to Yongyan&#x27;s concubine. Mianning was favored by his grandfather, the Qianlong Emperor. He frequently accompanied his grandfather on hunting trips. On one such trip, at the age of nine, Mianning successfully hunted a deer, which greatly amused the Qianlong Emperor. The emperor would abdicate five years after that incident, in 1796, when Mianning was 14. Mianning’s father Prince Yongyan was then enthroned as the Jiaqing Emperor, after which he made Lady Hitara (Mianning&#x27;s mother) his empress consort. The elderly Qianlong would live three more years in retirement before dying in 1799, aged 87, when Mianning was 17.

In 1813, while he was still a prince, Mianning also played a vital role in repelling and killing Eight Trigrams invaders who stormed the Forbidden City.

== Reign ==

=== Khoja rebellion in Xinjiang ===
In September 1820, at the age of 38, Mianning inherited the throne after the Jiaqing Emperor died suddenly of unknown causes. He became the first Qing emperor who was the eldest legitimate son of his father. Now known as the Daoguang Emperor, he inherited a declining empire with Westerners encroaching upon the borders of China. His era name, &quot;Daoguang&quot;, means &quot;radiant path&quot;. The Daoguang Emperor had been ruling for six years when the exiled heir to the Khojas, Jahangir Khoja, attacked Xinjiang from Kokand in the Afaqi Khoja revolts. By the end of 1826, the former Qing cities of Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, and Yangihissar had all fallen to the rebels. After a friend betrayed him in March 1827, Khoja was sent to Beijing in an iron litter and subsequently executed, while the Qing Empire regained control of their lost territory. The Uyghur Muslim Sayyid and Naqshbandi Sufi rebel of the Afaqi suborder, Jahangir Khoja was sliced to death (Lingchi) in 1828 by the Manchus for leading a rebellion against the Qing.

=== First Opium War ===
During the Daoguang Emperor&#x27;s reign, China experienced major problems with opium, which was imported into China by British merchants. Opium had started to trickle into China during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, but was limited to approximately 200 chests annually. By the time of the Qianlong era, this amount had increased to 1,000 chests, 4,000 chests by the Jiaqing era and more than 30,000 chests during the Daoguang era.

The Daoguang Emperor issued many imperial edicts banning opium in the 1820s and 1830s, which were carried out by Lin Zexu, whom he appointed as an Imperial Commissioner to Canton. Lin Zexu&#x27;s efforts to halt the spread of opium in China led directly to the First Opium War. With China losing the war, Lin Zexu was made a scapegoat. The Daoguang Emperor removed his authority and banished him to Yili. During the war, the Daoguang Emperor ordered 187 British and Indian prisoners of war held captive in Taiwan Prefecture to be summarily executed in 1842 in retaliation for the Chinese defeat at the Battle of Ningpo; the executions were carried out on 10 August by Chinese officials. The Chinese defeat in the war exposed Qing China&#x27;s technological and military inferiority to European powers, which led China in being forced to cede Hong Kong to the British in the Treaty of Nanjing in August 1842, and also pay a hefty indemnity which left the treasury desperate for funds. Meanwhile, in the Himalayas, the Sikh Empire attempted an occupation of Tibet but was defeated in the Sino-Sikh war (1841–1842).

=== Anti-Christianity ===
In 1811, a clause sentencing Europeans to death for spreading Catholicism had been added to the statute called &quot;Prohibitions Concerning Sorcerers and Sorceresses&quot; (禁止師巫邪術) in the Great Qing Legal Code. Protestants hoped that the Qing government would discriminate between Protestantism and Catholicism, since the law mentioned the latter by name, but after Protestant missionaries gave Christian books to Chinese people in 1835 and 1836, the Daoguang Emperor demanded to know who were the &quot;traitorous natives&quot; in Guangzhou who had supplied them with books.

===Noble titles===

The Daoguang Emperor granted the title of &quot;Wujing Boshi&quot; () to the descendants of Ran Qiu.

==Death and legacy==

The Daoguang Emperor died on 26 February 1850 at the Old Summer Palace, 8 km/5 miles northwest of Beijing, being the last Qing emperor to pass away in that Palace before it was burnt down by Anglo-French troops during the Second Opium War, a decade later. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Yizhu, who was later enthroned as the Xianfeng Emperor. The Daoguang Emperor failed to understand the intention or determination of the Europeans, or the basic economics of a war on drugs. Although the Europeans were outnumbered and thousands of miles away from logistical support in their native countries, they could bring far superior firepower to bear at any point of contact along the Chinese coast. The Qing government was highly dependent on the continued flow of taxes from southern China via the Grand Canal, which the British expeditionary force easily cut off at Zhenjiang.

The Daoguang Emperor ultimately had a poor understanding of the British and the Industrial Revolution that Britain and Western Europe had undergone, preferring to turn a blind eye to the rest of the world, though the distance from China to Europe most likely played a part. It was said that the emperor did not even know where Britain was located in the world. His 30-year reign saw rising economic tensions, sectarian instability and foreign interventions which would eventually lead to the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911.

The Daoguang Emperor was interred in the Mu (慕; lit. &quot;Longing&quot; or &quot;Admiration&quot;) mausoleum complex, which is part of the Western Qing Tombs, 120 km southwest of Beijing.

<text>The Jiaqing Emperor (13 November 1760 – 2 September 1820), also known by his temple name Emperor Renzong of Qing, personal name Yongyan, was the seventh emperor of the Qing dynasty and the fifth Qing emperor to rule over China proper. He was the 15th son of the Qianlong Emperor. During his reign, he prosecuted Heshen, the corrupt favorite of his father and attempted to restore order within the empire while curbing the smuggling of opium into China. Assessments of his reign are mixed, either seen as the &quot;beginning of the end&quot; of the Qing dynasty, or as a period of moderate reform that presaged the intellectual movements of the 1860s.

==Early years==

Yongyan was born in the Old Summer Palace, 8 km (5 mi) northwest of the walls of Beijing. His personal name, &quot;Yongyan&quot; (永琰), was later changed to &quot;Yongyan&quot; (顒琰) when he became the emperor. The Chinese character for &quot;yong&quot; in his name was changed from the more common 永 to the less common 顒. This novelty was introduced by the Qianlong Emperor, who believed that it was not proper to have a commonly used Chinese character in an emperor&#x27;s personal name due to the longstanding practice of naming taboo in the imperial family during ancient China period.

Yongyan was the 15th son of the Qianlong Emperor. His mother was Noble Consort Ling, the daughter of Wei Qingtai (魏清泰), an ethnic Han Chinese official whose family had been long integrated into the Manchu Eight Banners as part of a Han Banner.

The Qianlong Emperor originally had two other sons in mind for succeeding him, but both of them died early from diseases, hence in December 1773 he secretly chose Yongyan as his successor. In 1789, the Qianlong Emperor instated Yongyan as &quot;Prince Jia of the First Rank&quot; (嘉親王; or simply &quot;Prince Jia&quot;).

==Accession to the throne==
In October 1795, the 60th year of his reign, the Qianlong Emperor announced his intention to abdicate in favour of Prince Jia. He made this decision because he felt that it was disrespectful for him to rule longer than his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, who was on the throne for 61 years. Prince Jia ascended the throne and adopted the era name &quot;Jiaqing&quot; in February 1796, hence he is historically known as the Jiaqing Emperor. For the next three years, however, the Jiaqing Emperor was emperor in name and rite only because decisions were still made by his father, who became a &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (emperor emeritus) after his abdication. 

After the death of the Qianlong Emperor in the beginning of February 1799, the Jiaqing Emperor took control of the government and prosecuted Heshen, a favourite official of his father. Heshen was charged with corruption and abuse of power, stripped of his titles, had his property confiscated, and ordered to commit suicide. Heshen&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Princess Hexiao, a half-sister of the Jiaqing Emperor, was spared from punishment and given a few properties from Heshen&#x27;s estates. The Jiaqing Emperor commuted the death sentence of the scholar Hong Liangji who had criticised the policies of the Qianlong Emperor and Heshen, instead exiling him to a remote part of northern China and pardoning him altogether in 1800.

Heshen was described as the &#x27;primary evil&#x27; effecting the Empire, and after his removal the Emperor pursued a series of reforms of the court, civil service and treasury. He was a traditionalist in terms of his role as an ethnic Manchu leader, taking parts in imperial hunts, inspection tours, and upholding strict court protocol. As part of this traditionalist approach, the Jiaqing Emperor promoted ministers on the basis of their commitment to a &#x27;purist&#x27; approach to Confucian rule.

The impact of the Jiaqing Emperor&#x27;s reforms are questionable, with the Emperor described by Jonathan Spence as having &#x27;relied on rhetoric more than specific policies to cleanse his empire&#x27;, with Heshen&#x27;s clique soon replaced by other bureaucratic factions.

At the time, the Qing Empire faced internal disorder, most importantly the large-scale White Lotus (1796–1804) and Miao (1795–1806) rebellions, as well as an empty imperial treasury. The Jiaqing Emperor engaged in the pacification of the empire and the quelling of rebellions, although this came at a steep fiscal cost. He endeavored to bring China back to its 18th-century prosperity and power. 

In 1813, the Jiaqing Emperor also faced the threat of the Eight Trigrams uprising, led by a millenarian Buddhist sect that launched a failed attack on the Forbidden City, with the intention of assassinating the Emperor upon his return from a hunting trip. The Jiaqing Emperor was intrigued by the leader of the rising, Lin Qing, and summoned him to a private interrogation. Lin was later executed by slicing.

===Foreign relations===
In 1816, William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst was sent as ambassador extraordinary to the court, intending to establish more satisfactory commercial relations between China and Great Britain. The Amherst Embassy proved a failure as a result of Amherst&#x27;s refusal to perform a kowtow to the Emperor, but would prove to have a significant impact on British views of China and the Qing dynasty.

The Jiaqing Emperor refused the Vietnamese ruler Gia Long&#x27;s request to change his country&#x27;s name to Nam Việt, but agreed that it could be changed to Việt Nam instead. Gia Long&#x27;s &quot;Đại Nam thực lục&quot; contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming.

===Opposition to Christianity===
The Great Qing Legal Code includes one statute titled &quot;Prohibitions Concerning Sorcerers and Sorceresses&quot; (禁止師巫邪術). In 1811, a clause was added to it with reference to Christianity. It was modified in 1815 and 1817, settled in its final form in 1839 under the Daoguang Emperor, and repealed in 1870 under the Tongzhi Emperor. It sentenced Europeans to death for spreading Catholicism among Han Chinese and Manchus. Christians who would not repent their conversion were sent to Muslim cities in Xinjiang, to be given as slaves to Muslim leaders and beys.

===Chinese nobility===
The Jiaqing Emperor granted the title &quot;Wujing Boshi&quot; () to the descendants of Tang essayist Han Yu.

== Personal life and interests ==

The Jiaqing Emperor commissioned printed compendia of courtly collections, which are an important source for our present understanding of Qing court art. He was a keen scholar of the Confucian classics (to which he devoted much of his time in the early years of his reign when the Qianlong Emperor remained &quot;de facto&quot; ruler), with 15,267 poems attributed to him.

==Death and burial==
On 2 September 1820, the Jiaqing Emperor died at the Rehe (Jehol) Traveling Palace (熱河行宫), 230 km (140 mi) northeast of Beijing, where the imperial court was in summer quarters. The &quot;Draft History of Qing&quot; did not record a cause of death. Some have alleged that he died after being struck by lightning, but others prefer the theory that he died of a stroke, as the emperor was quite obese. He was succeeded by his second son, Mianning, who became known as the Daoguang Emperor.

The Jiaqing Emperor was interred amidst the Western Qing Tombs, 120 km (75 mi) southwest of Beijing, in the Chang (昌; lit. &quot;splendid&quot;) mausoleum complex.
