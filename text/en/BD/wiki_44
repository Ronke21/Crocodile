<text>is a fictional character in the Japanese &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media franchise created by Akira Toriyama. He made his appearance in chapter #161 &quot;Son Goku Wins!!&quot;, published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on February 9, 1988, as the reincarnation of the evil King Piccolo, who was positioned as a demonic antagonist of the series. However, it is later revealed that he is in fact a member of an extraterrestrial humanoid species called Namekians from an exoplanet called Namek, those able to create the series&#x27; eponymous wish-granting Dragon Balls. After losing to Son Goku in the World Martial Arts Tournament, Piccolo teams up with him and his friends in order to defeat newer, more dangerous and powerful threats, such as Vegeta, Frieza, Cell, Majin Buu, Beerus, Zamasu, Jiren, Broly, and Moro. He also trains Goku&#x27;s eldest son, Gohan, and the two form a very strong bond.

Piccolo is one of the most popular and recognizable characters from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise. The character has been consistently well received by fans and video game publications, with high placements in multiple &quot;top&quot; character lists and popularity polls. The character has also inspired &quot;Naruto&quot; manga author Masashi Kishimoto, as well as an Internet meme which became popular in Japan in 2013.

== Creation and development ==
Piccolo, more specifically his parent King Piccolo, was created by Toriyama as he wanted to have a villain who would be a true &quot;bad guy.&quot; Prior to his creation, nearly all the previous villains in the series were considered too likable. His editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, stated he introduced Toriyama to evil historical figures for inspiration. King Piccolo was created after he told the author how Roman Emperor Nero enjoyed watching people suffer. However, the &quot;Shenlong Times&quot; issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the &quot;Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide&quot; guidebook, says that the character was modeled after Torishima himself. After creating King Piccolo, Toriyama noted that it was one of the most interesting parts of the series and that he became one of his favorite characters. Although Piccolo&#x27;s transformation from a villain to a hero was considered by Toriyama to be cliché, he still felt excited when drawing him, noting that despite having a scary face, he still looks appealing.

Piccolo is initially assumed to, like his parent, be a member of the , however, midway through the series it is learned that they are actually members of the alien race called . Toriyama stated that he never thought of making Piccolo an alien until Kami was introduced. Until recently, Dragon Ball Daima has introduced that Namekians are now from the Demon Realm, an alternate universe of demons, making the whole race of Namekians a Demon race.

For the film &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, Toriyama said that he wanted the plot to focus on the dynamic between Gohan and Piccolo due to how their close relationship motivates the former even more than his father, Goku, to be determined to fight. , which Toriyama considers Piccolo&#x27;s first transformation, was made orange and extremely muscled to distinguish him from Piccolo&#x27;s regular form. The buffed body was done since, unlike other characters, Piccolo does not have hair to change in a transformation. Toriyama wondered that while he should have been more over-the-top with Piccolo, he is glad he finally gave him a chance to make him as strong as Goku. Toriyama said that, while Piccolo is a stoic character, he wanted to make him act different in the movie.

=== Voice actors ===

In the original Japanese version of the anime and all other media, Piccolo is voiced by Toshio Furukawa, with the only two exceptions being his initial newborn child form which was voiced by Hiromi Tsuru, and in &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot;, where a mini version of Piccolo was voiced by Tomohiro Yamaguchi. Furukawa, who up to that point had mostly played happy lighter-voiced characters, said he got the role because he stated in interviews at the time that he wanted to play a villain. He said it was difficult to constantly perform with a low voice because his normal lighter voice would break through if he broke concentration. When asked if Takeshi Aono&#x27;s work as King Piccolo influenced his portrayal of Piccolo, Furukawa replied that because King Piccolo was impulsive, he initially played his own role as an energetic person around eighteen-years-old and later imagined him as close to thirty-years-old in &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. Furukawa, as well as Gohan&#x27;s voice actress Masako Nozawa, said the episodes where Piccolo trains Gohan left an impression on them. He said the fans really enjoyed those episodes as well. Furukawa also cited Piccolo making a pun for King Kai as memorable because it was so out of character for him. By the time he reprised the voice in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, Piccolo had become Furukawa&#x27;s favorite character of all his roles.

In English, several different voice actors have voiced Piccolo, including Scott McNeil in episodes 1-53 (1-67 unedited) in Funimation Entertainment&#x27;s initial dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; in association with Saban Entertainment and Ocean Productions as well as Geneon&#x27;s dub of the first three &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; films, and episodes 108-291 of Westwood Media&#x27;s dub of the franchise (in association with Ocean Productions); by Ethan Cole in Chinook Animation&#x27;s dub of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; (produced in association with Blue Water Studios); by British-born French actor Paul Bandey in the infamous English dubs of the movies released exclusively in the UK and the Netherlands by AB Groupe (wherein the character was referred to as &quot;Big Green&quot;), by David Gasman (who also voiced Goku in this dub) in the European dub of &quot;Dead Zone&quot; (there called &quot;In Pursuit of Garlic&quot;), vocal grunts by Ed Marcus in &quot;The History of Trunks&quot; (or &quot;Gohan and Trunks&quot;) and consistently by Christopher Sabat in Funimation&#x27;s in-house dub of all &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media. Ray Chase voices Piccolo in the Toonami Asia broadcast of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment.

== Abilities ==
Piccolo has shown many unique abilities throughout the series. Due to his Namekian physiology, Piccolo can expand his arms, move fast enough to not be seen, regenerate lost limbs of his body so long as his head is still intact, and possesses superhuman hearing and strength. Piccolo&#x27;s allows him to become gigantic to the point where he is capable of reaching mountain-like heights. He can also conjure objects such as garments and a blade, including his cape and turban outfit. Among Piccolo&#x27;s known psionic skills, he is able to communicate telepathically with select individuals. Thus, this enables him to read minds and mentally contact others nearby. In one instance, he alerts Goten and Trunks of Buu&#x27;s proximity to the dimension where the two were training.

Like many other characters in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Piccolo has the ability of flight through the technique called . He also possesses an attack called the , which is fired with one hand being supported by the other. One of Piccolo&#x27;s most powerful attacks is the an attack that is expelled from Piccolo&#x27;s index and middle fingers. Unlike most energy-based attacks in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, the potent &quot;Makankōsappō&quot; pierces its targets like a drill rather than enveloping them or exploding on contact. Another attack of Piccolo&#x27;s is the , which involves firing off many orbs of energy that float around the opponent. Piccolo then squeezes his hand to make all the orbs converge onto the opponent, exploding on contact. The is another of his signature attacks, being one that he teaches to his pupil Gohan. Another move Piccolo is seen to have is the which is conjured by putting his hands on his chest, gathering energy, and then releasing it outwards. One of Piccolo&#x27;s less frequently used techniques is the ability to fire energy rays from his eyes, which he first uses against Krillin&#x27;s energy attack during their match in the 23rd &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, then later against Goku in the finals, and again when he trains Gohan. It is also revealed that he is capable of performing the , and invented by Master Mutaito to seal his evil parent in a rice cooker, and can reverse this technique, using it against his good counterpart.

Piccolo can also perform a type of fusion, which he does with Nail on planet Namek to confront Frieza and with Kami to confront the Androids, each time greatly increasing his power; the first time enough to clash toe-to-toe with Frieza&#x27;s second form, and in the latter, he becomes much more powerful than an unmastered Super Saiyan. 
In this form, he has been known as a Super Namekian and was able to fight on par with Android 17.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; ===
Introduced as the offspring and reincarnate of King Piccolo, Piccolo Jr. plans to continue his parents&#x27; mission of world domination and avenge his death at the hands of Goku. Piccolo enters the 23rd &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot; under the alias . Piccolo defeats both Krillin, who gives up, and Kami, by reversing the &quot;Evil Containment Wave&quot; and sealing Kami in the container intended for Piccolo. He then fights Goku in the final round, who tricks Piccolo into enlarging himself so he can retrieve Kami, from there causing many of Piccolo&#x27;s techniques to backfire on him. Though crippling both Goku&#x27;s arms and legs, Piccolo is defeated when Goku headbutts him out of the ring, though recovers thanks to receiving a Senzu bean from Goku, who he promises to defeat as he departs.

=== &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; ===
Five years later, Piccolo teams up with Goku to defeat his older brother Raditz. Piccolo can defeat Raditz, but at the cost of Goku&#x27;s life, as Piccolo&#x27;s move &quot;Makankōsappō&quot; cuts through both Saiyans. Piccolo&#x27;s subsequent conversation with the dying Raditz, in which he reveals that the Dragon Balls can resurrect, is broadcast. Piccolo remains amazed by Gohan&#x27;s powers and trains him to prepare for the fight against the two Saiyans who will invade Earth. As the year goes by, Piccolo starts to change as he spends time training Gohan, slowly beginning to bond with him. When the Saiyans arrive a year later, Piccolo discovers his heritage from the planet Namek. In the fight against Nappa, Piccolo sacrifices himself to protect Gohan from the attack, resulting in the deaths of both himself and Kami. After the Saiyans are defeated, Gohan and the survivors travel to Piccolo&#x27;s homeworld, Namek, to revive those who died against the Saiyans with the Namekian Dragon Balls. In the meantime, Piccolo trains in the afterlife with King Kai. Piccolo is resurrected on planet Namek to help Goku and others defeat the evil Frieza. He takes this time to merge with the beaten Namekian called Nail, giving Piccolo a power increase. The power increase allows him to go head-to-head with Frieza&#x27;s second transformation. However, the plan fails as Frieza reveals the full extent of his powers. In Frieza&#x27;s following fight with Goku, who tries charging a &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; to defeat him, Piccolo assists him alongside Gohan and Krillin. Once Frieza emerges from the impact of the &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; unscathed, Piccolo is severely injured by Frieza with a shot to the chest. Piccolo is later teleported off the planet to safety on Earth and, after regaining consciousness, declines to return to a new version of Namek as he wishes to protect Gohan and become stronger while remaining on Earth.

After Frieza&#x27;s death, Piccolo trains with Goku and Gohan for three years to prepare for a battle against two powerful Androids created by the Red Ribbon Army&#x27;s Doctor Gero to kill Goku. Though he manages to best Gero in battle, he is unable to prevent him from activating the other Androids. After being defeated by Android 17, Piccolo seeks to unite with Kami and gain another massive increase in power. Piccolo becomes aware of a more dangerous threat named Cell, who seeks to absorb #17 and #18. After Cell escapes, Piccolo once again battles the Androids, except this time he battles #17 one one-on-one. After a somewhat even match, Cell arrives on the battle scene; Cell needs to absorb the Androids to complete his power. While trying to prevent this, Piccolo is nearly killed by Cell, surviving the encounter thanks to his regenerative abilities and following some training in the Room of Spirit and Time, he is forced to participate in a tournament created by Cell called the Cell Games, where he fights one of the seven Cell Juniors that are created by Cell, who are later destroyed by Gohan.

Seven years later, Piccolo is poised to fight the Supreme Kai at the 25th &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, forfeiting the match after finding himself reluctant to fight and journeying with him to confront Babidi, being turned into stone by Dabura. After being freed upon Dabura&#x27;s death, he attempts to kill Babidi. Piccolo discovers Babidi survived. Babidi later demands Piccolo be brought forward or humans will die in the meantime. Piccolo then acts as a trainer to Goten and Trunks and their fused form Gotenks. Piccolo trains the boys to fight the evil creature Majin Buu, who finds them and the other heroes. After more unsuccessful attempts to kill Buu, he is later absorbed by Buu along with Gotenks and Gohan and dies when Buu destroys the Earth He is then revived through the Dragon Balls and aids Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki-Dama&quot; attack, which Goku uses to defeat Buu once and for all.

=== &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; ===
In &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, Piccolo combats Beerus alongside Android 18 and Tien Shinhan, only to be bested; and, in &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot;, Piccolo narrowly escapes death once Frieza destroys the Earth. After the events of the latter two films, Piccolo is resurrected after being killed by Frieza in the &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; retelling of &quot;Resurrection &#x27;F and agrees to train Gohan again. Piccolo then accepts a request to participate in a tournament against Universe 6 fighters, where his loss to Frost is retracted after cheating on Frost&#x27;s part is discovered, though he still declines being allowed to fight more as Vegeta wants to take his place. After this, Piccolo reunites with Trunks and teaches him a technique to defeat his enemy. In the final arc of the anime, Piccolo participates in a fighting tournament after training Gohan once again.

After these events, in &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&quot;, Piccolo, standing by an unknown location, telepathically senses Goku having trouble fighting the titular character, and after he and Vegeta transport themselves to Piccolo via &quot;Shunkan Idō&quot;, later assists them into performing the &quot;Fusion&quot; technique successfully after two failed, hilarious attempts. The newly-christened Gogeta then leaves to stop Broly.

Shortly after during the Moro arc, Piccolo joins the Z fighters in their fight against Moro and his henchmen when they arrive to Earth. During the battle with Moro, Piccolo is critically wounded but can recover with a Senzu bean. At the end of the battle, Piccolo is one of the many heroes that lends his power to Goku, enabling him to defeat Moro once and for all.

Years later in &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot;, Piccolo, after training Pan and visiting Gohan, is ambushed by android Gamma 2 and is defeated, evading death and detection afterward. He then discovers the resurrected Red Ribbon Army and its ulterior motives while disguised. Through a wish from the Dragon Balls, Shenlong unlocks Piccolo&#x27;s potential, taking on an empowered state similar to that of his pupil&#x27;s form, and has Pan play along with a plan to sabotage the army&#x27;s ploy and put Gohan back to fighting spirit. He then ascends to his first true transformation as a &quot;little extra&quot; from the dragon, referred to as . He battles the monstrous Cell Max giant-to-giant, but is severely outmatched and injured, causing Gohan to awaken his power through fury. He then restrains the monster for Gohan to pierce his forehead with a &quot;Makankōsappō.&quot;

Shortly after the events of Super Hero, Goku returns to earth with Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and Vegeta. Goku and Piccolo briefly discuss the new form Piccolo achieved before they pick up Pan from school.

=== Video games ===
Piccolo has been in many &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;-related video games such as &quot;Super Butōden&quot;, the &quot;Budokai&quot; and &quot;Budokai Tenkaichi&quot; series of games, as well as &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Infinite World&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Burst Limit&quot;.

== Cultural impact ==

The character has influenced &quot;Naruto&quot; manga author Masashi Kishimoto; in order to give Sasuke Uchiha a central role in the film &quot;&quot;, Kishimoto made him the teacher of the protagonist Boruto Uzumaki as his father, Naruto Uzumaki, was busy. This was inspired by how Piccolo starts training Gohan when Goku dies in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. The dynamic between game characters Sonic the Hedgehog and Tails from &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; was based on Piccolo and Gohan&#x27;s dynamic too.

Piccolo&#x27;s attack &quot;Special Beam Cannon&quot; / &quot;Makankōsappō&quot; became a meme that started with Japanese schoolgirls photographing themselves using, and being affected by, this attack in 2013. According to gaming blog &quot;Kotaku&quot;, the trend took off after photos were posted on Japan&#x27;s largest bulletin board 2channel, with photographs typically showing one person striking the ground or making a mystical gesture while others around them are photographically captured in mid-air. The meme is also called &quot;Hadouken-ing&quot; after the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; move of the same name, which is done in a similar fashion.

=== Reception ===
Piccolo is a popular character in the series. He placed fifth in both the 1993 and 1995 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; character popularity polls voted on by &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; readers. In 2004, fans of the series voted him the fifth most popular character for a poll in the book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;. Piccolo has appeared in various Anime Grand Prix polls, taking high places in the category &quot;best male character&quot; in 1990, 1991 and 1992 polls.

Piccolo&#x27;s character has received praise and criticism from publications for various media. DVDTalk enjoyed Piccolo&#x27;s malicious characterization which, in retrospect, makes a major contrast with his more mature portrayal from &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. During a review of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime, Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment noted Piccolo to be able to perform a large number of abilities in contrast to other characters such as Goku, making the fight between both of them unbalanced. However, he found the said battle to be very entertaining despite it lasting several episodes. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found Piccolo&#x27;s differences from &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; to &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; as one of the reasons the former show is recommendable to viewers over the later anime. While reviewing the fourth &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; film, Anime News Network writer Allen Drivers found Piccolo&#x27;s initial scenes peacefully enough to entertain viewers. In a later film, John Sinnott from DVD Talk criticized Piccolo&#x27;s involvement saying he appears &quot;from out of no where&quot; in order to fight alongside his friends giving the film little reasoning. Chris Homer from The Fandom Post believed Piccolo&#x27;s sacrifice in &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; &quot;was a genuine touching moment&quot; for fans of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, but also viewed the death as relying &quot;too much on previous ideas&quot; in order for it to get sorted. Beveridge praised Piccolo&#x27;s growth in &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; as one of the most important parts of the series, noting how he decides to train Gohan to fight Vegeta.

Although Katherine Luther from About.com noted Piccolo to be one of the strongest warriors from his planet, she mentioned he has several weaknesses that make him weaker than other characters from the series, with his most notable one being his affection for Gohan. Sam Leach from Anime News Network noted that some fans of the series tend to joke that Piccolo is a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; emphasized it more when Piccolo started training him again. Piccolo&#x27;s return in &quot;Super Hero&quot; earned similar comments from &quot;Polygon&quot; due to how he continues his role as Gohan&#x27;s guardian and takes a more civilized way of living to stay close to him and train. As a result of these events in the movie, &quot;Polygon&quot; claimed that he was the best father in the entire franchise and that Gohan honors him during the film, most notably in the climax. Anime News Network praised Piccolo&#x27;s characterization from &quot;Super Hero&quot; as he comes across as a more appealing character. IGN also enjoyed the handling of Piccolo and his dynamic with Gohan as the duo is as entertaining as the previous protagonist they are replacing, Goku and Vegeta, and praise Piccolo&#x27;s paternal figure to Gohan as he works to make his disciple stronger and was also found charming. However, the fact that the new androids can rival Piccolo and Gohan so easily came across as forced and at the same time as common in the franchise due to how power levels are often exaggerated. Piccolo&#x27;s relationship with Pan as he trains her well as his new Orange power up were praised by HobbyConsolas with the latter being linked with Western superheroes. In regards to the film&#x27;s presentation, GameSpot claimed that Piccolo and Gohan are the best CGI designed characters contrasting with poor models used for Goku and Vegeta and also found charming the awkward way Piccolo interacts with the rest of the characters such as when he uses a cellphone in a strange position and noted that the film made him more attached with the rest of the cast.

<doc id="262054" wikidata="Q1028032" url="?curid=262054" title="Great Balls of Fire">
<text>&quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; is a 1957 popular song recorded by American rock and roll musician Jerry Lee Lewis on Sun Records and featured in the 1957 movie &quot;Jamboree&quot;. It was written by Otis Blackwell and Jack Hammer. The Jerry Lee Lewis 1957 recording was ranked as the 96th greatest song ever by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. It is written in AABA form. It sold one million copies in its first 10 days of release in the United States making it one of the best-selling singles in the United States at that time.

==Background and Composition==
&quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; is best known for Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27;s original, which was recorded in the Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, on October 8, 1957, using three personnel: Lewis (piano/vocals), Sidney Stokes (bass), and a session drummer, Larry Linn, instead of the usual Sun backups Jimmy Van Eaton (drums) and Roland Janes (guitar). Lewis was quoted in the book &quot;JLL: His Own Story&quot; by Rick Bragg, (pg 133), as saying &quot;I knew Sidney Stokes but I didn&#x27;t know him that well either, and I don&#x27;t know what happened to them people. That&#x27;s the last time I ever seen &#x27;em. That&#x27;s strange isn&#x27;t it?&quot; It was released as a 45rpm single on Sun 281 in November 1957. It reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts, No. 3 on the R&amp;B charts, and No. 1 on the country charts. It also reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, and appeared on the New Zealand Singles Chart and the Dutch Top 40.

The song was featured in a performance by Jerry Lee Lewis and his band in the 1957 Warner Brothers rock and roll film &quot;Jamboree&quot;, which also featured Carl Perkins, Fats Domino, Buddy Knox, and Dick Clark. The recording was released in the UK on London Records.

The tune opens up side 2 of Lewis&#x27;s 1964 album &quot;Live at the Star Club, Hamburg&quot;.

==Legacy==
* The song was performed by Levi Kreis in the 2010 musical &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot;, portraying Jerry Lee Lewis.
* The title of the 1989 biopic, &quot;Great Balls of Fire!&quot; about Lewis, played by Dennis Quaid, is derived from the song title.
* In 2017, WWE held a professional wrestling event titled &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, referencing the song. Jerry Lawler&#x27;s personal attorney, who also represents Jerry Lee Lewis, informed him that the singer had actually trademarked the phrase, prompting Lawler to inform them of this. He stated that he &quot;put him in touch with the WWE people, gave him a name. Apparently he called them and got everything worked out. Not only are they using the name, they are using Jerry Lee&#x27;s song.&quot;
*Ric Flair revealed he started using his iconic &quot;Wooo!&quot; catchphrase in 1974 after he heard Jerry Lee Lewis sing the lyric, “Goodness gracious, great balls of fire, woo!”
* Cree Summer, at age 17, sang the song as the opening and closing for Madballs’ Escape from Orb.
* Dolly Parton sang it at the grand opening of FireChaser Express.

In 1998, the 1957 recording of &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; by Jerry Lee Lewis on Sun Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. 
===&quot;Top Gun&quot; franchise===
In the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, LTJG Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw (portrayed by Anthony Edwards) plays the song in a bar with his family and Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell (Tom Cruise). The song is available on the &quot;Top Gun&quot; soundtrack special edition released in 1999. The song is performed again in the sequel, the 2022 film &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot; by Goose&#x27;s son LT Bradley &quot;Rooster&quot; Bradshaw (portrayed by Miles Teller). During the editing process, it was determined that the song would evoke flashbacks of Goose’s death while Maverick watches from outside the hard deck bar. 

Teller&#x27;s performance is included on that film&#x27;s soundtrack &quot;Top Gun: Maverick (Music from the Motion Picture)&quot;, on which it is labeled as a live performance. Paramount Pictures later released the extended scene of Teller&#x27;s performance as Rooster on YouTube on June 16, 2022.

<text>John Jamieson (3 March 1759 – 12 July 1838) was a Scottish minister of religion, lexicographer, philologist and antiquary. His most important work is the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language&quot;.

==Life==
He was born in Glasgow in March 1759 the son of Rev John Jamieson, minister of the Associate Congregation on Duke Street. He was educated at Glasgow Grammar School.

He studied at the University of Glasgow 1768 to 1771, and subsequently attended classes in Divinity at the University of Edinburgh, 1775–6. After six years&#x27; theological study, Jamieson was licensed to preach in 1781 and became pastor of the Secessionist (Anti-burgher) congregation in Forfar, Angus. He was 23 years old at the time and was ordained on 23 August 1780 and the following August being involved in a &quot;romantic, moonlit marriage&quot;.

In 1788 he was asked to replace Rev Adam Gib at the Anti-burgher church in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, but did not accept this until its next vacancy, being inducted on 30 May 1797. The union of the Burgher and Anti-Burgher &quot;New Licht&quot; churches to form the United Secession Church in 1820 was largely due to his exertions.

He retired from the ministry in 1830, spending the rest of his life in Edinburgh. In the 1830s he is listed as living at 4 George Square on the south side of the city.

Jamieson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1803. His proposers were James Bonar, Alexander Fraser Tytler, and William Moodie. He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.

In 1827 he was elected a member of the Bannatyne Club.

He retired due to ill health in 1830 and died at home, 4 George Square, Edinburgh on 12 July 1838 and is buried in St Cuthbert&#x27;s churchyard. He was buried with his son Robert (who pre-deceased him) in a large and elaborate grave in the southern section. His inscription is on the rear of the monument.

==Works==
Jamieson&#x27;s major work, the &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language&quot; appeared in 2 vols. in 1808. A meeting the Danish scholar Grim Thorkelin had suggested this work, and, working with Thomas Ruddiman&#x27;s glossary to Gavin Douglas&#x27;s version of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Jamieson completed the work almost alone. He prepared an abridgment in 1818 (reissued in 1846 with a memoir by John Johnstone), and aided by numerous others, he added two supplementary volumes in 1825. The work drew on folklore and provincialisms. The introductory antiquarian dissertation supported a theory on the Pictish influence on the Scots language. A revised edition by John Longmuir and David Donaldson was issued in 1879–87. These volumes remained the standard reference work for the Scots language until the publication of the &quot;Scottish National Dictionary&quot; in 1931.

Jamieson&#x27;s other works included:
* &quot;Socinianism Unmasked&quot;, 1786.
* &quot;The Sorrows of Slavery&quot;, 1789, a pamphlet on the African slave trade
* &quot;Sermons on the Heart&quot;, 2 vols., 1791. Around the same time as &quot;The Sorrows of Slavery&quot;.
* &quot;Congal and Fenella, a Metrical Tale&quot;, 1791.
* &quot;Vindication of the Doctrine of Scripture&quot;, in reply to Joseph Priestley&#x27;s &quot;History of Early Opinions&quot;, 2 vols., 1795.
* &quot;A Poem on Eternity&quot;, 1798.
* &quot;Remarks on Rowland Hill&#x27;s Journal&quot;, 1799.
* &quot;The Use of Sacred History&quot;, 1802, vol.1, vol.2
* &quot;Important Trial in the Court of Conscience&quot;, 1806.
* &quot;Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language&quot;, 2 vols 1808.
* &quot;A Treatise on the Ancient Culdees of Iona&quot; also retitled &quot;A History of the Culdees&quot;, 1811, published, through Walter Scott&#x27;s support, by Ballantyne.
* &quot;Hermes Scythicus&quot;, 1814, expounding affinities between the Gothic and the classical tongues.
* &quot;Supplement to the Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language&quot;, 2 vols 1825.
* &quot;Views of the Royal Palaces of Scotland&quot; (1828) published posthumously

Jamieson wrote on other themes: rhetoric, cremation, and the royal palaces of Scotland, besides publishing occasional sermons. In 1820 he issued edited versions of John Barbour&#x27;s &quot;Bruce&quot; and Blind Harry&#x27;s &quot;Wallace&quot;. Posthumous was &quot;Dissertations on the Reality of the Spirit&#x27;s Influence&quot; (1844).

==Family==

In 1781, Jamieson married Charlotte Watson (died 1837), daughter of Robert Watson, Esq., of Easter Rhind, Perthshire, and had seventeen children, of whom only two daughters and one son survived. His son, Robert Jameson (died 1834) advocate, became a distinguished member of the Faculty of Advocates. His daughter Margaret Robina married Donald Mackenzie of the 21st Fusiliers and was mother of Donald Mackenzie, Lord Mackenzie.

<text>A container ship (also called boxship or spelled containership) is a cargo ship that carries all of its load in truck-size intermodal containers, in a technique called containerization. Container ships are a common means of commercial intermodal freight transport and now carry most seagoing non-bulk cargo.

Container ship capacity is measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU). Typical loads are a mix of 20-foot (1-TEU) and 40-foot (2-TEU) ISO-standard containers, with the latter predominant.

Today, about 90% of non-bulk cargo worldwide is transported by container ships, the largest of which, from 2023 onward, can carry over 24,000 TEU.

==History==



There are two main types of dry cargo: bulk cargo and break bulk cargo. Bulk cargoes, like grain or coal, are transported unpackaged in the hull of the ship, generally in large volume. Break-bulk cargoes, in contrast, are transported in packages, and are generally manufactured goods.

Before the advent of containerization in the 1950s, break-bulk items required manual loading, lashing, unlashing and unloading from the ship one piece at a time. This stevedoring process became more efficient by grouping cargo into containers, of cargo, or up to about , is moved at once and each container is secured to the ship once in a standardized way. Containerization has increased the efficiency of moving traditional break-bulk cargoes significantly, reducing shipping time by 84% and costs by 35%. In 2001, more than 90% of world trade in non-bulk goods was transported in ISO containers. In 2009, almost one quarter of the world&#x27;s dry cargo was shipped by container, an estimated 125 million TEU or 1.19 billion tonnes worth of cargo.

The first ships designed to carry standardized load units were used in the late 18th century in England. In 1766 James Brindley designed the box boat &quot;Starvationer&quot; with 10 wooden containers, to transport coal from Worsley Delph to Manchester via the Bridgewater Canal. Before the Second World War, the first container ships were used to carry the baggage of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris (Southern Railway&#x27;s Golden Arrow / La Flèche d&#x27;Or). These containers were loaded in London or Paris, and carried to ports of Dover or Calais on flat cars. In February 1931, the first container ship in the world was launched; the &quot;Autocarrier&quot;, owned by the Southern Railway. It had 21 slots for containers of Southern Railway.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/S AUTOCARRIER&quot;&gt; | url= http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/autocarrier_1931_b_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest container ships after the Second World War were converted oil tankers, built up from surplus T2 tankers after World War II. In 1951, the first purpose-built container vessels began operating in Denmark, and between Seattle and Alaska. The first commercially successful container ship was , a T2 tanker, owned by Malcom McLean, which carried 58 metal containers between Newark, New Jersey and Houston, Texas, on its first voyage. In 1955, McLean built his company, McLean Trucking into one of the United States&#x27; biggest freighter fleets. In 1955, he purchased the small Pan Atlantic Steamship Company from Waterman Steamship and adapted its ships to carry cargo in large uniform metal containers. On April 26, 1956, the first of these rebuilt container vessels, &quot;Ideal X&quot;, left the Port Newark in New Jersey and a new revolution in modern shipping resulted.

In the 1950s, a new standardized steel Intermodal container based on specifications from the United States Department of Defense began to revolutionize freight transportation.

The White Pass &amp; Yukon Route railway acquired the world&#x27;s first purpose built container ship, the &quot;Clifford J. Rogers&quot;, built in 1955, and introduced containers to its railway in 1956.

MV &quot;Kooringa&quot; was the world&#x27;s first fully cellular, purpose-built container ship. and was built by Australian company Associated Steamships, a partnership formed by the 1964 merger of the Adelaide Steamship Company with McIlwraith, McEacharn &amp; Co, then commissioned in May 1964.

Container ships were designed to accommodate intermodal transport of goods, and eliminated requirements for the individual hatches, holds and other dividers of traditional cargo ships. The hull of a typical container ship is similar to an airport hangar, or a huge warehouse, which is divided into individual holding cells, using vertical guide rails. The ship&#x27;s cells are designed to hold cargo containers, which are typically constructed of steel, though sometimes of aluminum, fiberglass or plywood, and designed for intermodal transfers between ship and train, truck or semi-trailer. Shipping containers are categorized by type, size and function.

Today, about 90% of non-bulk cargo worldwide is transported by container by about 50,000 container ships. Modern container ships can carry over 24,000 TEU. The largest container ships measure about in length, and carry loads equal to the cargo-carrying capacity of sixteen to seventeen pre-World War II freighter ships.

==Architecture==
There are several key points in the design of modern container ships. The hull, similar to that of bulk carriers and general cargo ships, is built around a strong keel. Into this frame is set one or more below-deck cargo holds, numerous tanks, and the engine room. The holds are topped by hatch covers, onto which more containers can be stacked. Many container ships have cargo cranes installed on them, and some have specialized systems for securing containers on board.

The hull of a modern cargo ship is a complex arrangement of steel plates and strengthening beams. Resembling ribs, and fastened at right angles to the keel, are the ship&#x27;s frames. The ship&#x27;s main deck, the metal platework that covers the top of the hull framework, is supported by beams that are attached to the tops of the frames and run the full breadth of the ship. The beams not only support the deck, but along with the deck, frames, and transverse bulkheads, strengthen and reinforce the shell. Another feature of recent hulls is a set of double-bottom tanks, which provide a second watertight shell that runs most of the length of a ship. The double-bottoms generally hold liquids such as fuel oil, ballast water or fresh water.

A ship&#x27;s engine room houses its main engines and auxiliary machinery such as the fresh water and sewage systems, electrical generators, fire pumps, and air conditioners. In most new ships, the engine room is located in the aft portion.

=== Size categories ===

Container ships are distinguished into 7 major size categories: small feeder, feeder, feedermax, Panamax, Post-Panamax, Neopanamax and ultra-large. As of December 2012, there were 161 container ships in the VLCS class (Very Large Container Ships, more than 10,000 TEU), and 51 ports in the world can accommodate them.

The size of a Panamax vessel is limited by the original Panama canal&#x27;s lock chambers, which can accommodate ships with a beam of up to 32.31 m, a length overall of up to 294.13 m, and a draft of up to 12.04 m. The Post-Panamax category has historically been used to describe ships with a moulded breadth over 32.31 m, however the Panama Canal expansion project has caused some changes in terminology. The Neopanamax category is based on the maximum vessel size that is able to transit a new third set of locks, which opened in June 2016. The third set of locks were built to accommodate a container ship with a length overall of , a maximum beam (width) of , and tropical fresh-water draft of . Such a vessel, called Neopanamax class, is wide enough to carry 19 columns of containers, can have a total capacity of approximately 12,000 TEU and is comparable in size to a capesize bulk carrier or a Suezmax tanker.

Container ships under 3,000 TEU are generally called feeder ships or feeders. They are small ships that typically operate between smaller container ports. Some feeders collect their cargo from small ports, drop it off at large ports for transshipment on larger ships, and distribute containers from the large port to smaller regional ports. This size of vessel is the most likely to carry cargo cranes on board.


===Cargo cranes===

A major characteristic of a container ship is whether it has cranes installed for handling its cargo. Those that have cargo cranes are called &quot;geared&quot; and those that do not are called &quot;ungeared&quot; or &quot;gearless&quot;. The earliest purpose-built container ships in the 1970s were all gearless. Since then, the percentage of geared newbuilds has fluctuated widely, but has been decreasing overall, with only 7.5% of the container ship capacity in 2009 being equipped with cranes.

While geared container ships are more flexible in that they can visit ports that are not equipped with pierside container cranes, they suffer from several drawbacks. To begin with, geared ships will cost more to purchase than a gearless ship. Geared ships also incur greater recurring expenses, such as maintenance and fuel costs. The United Nations Council on Trade and Development characterizes geared ships as a &quot;niche market only appropriate for those ports where low cargo volumes do not justify investment in port cranes or where the public sector does not have the financial resources for such investment&quot;.

Instead of the rotary cranes, some geared ships have gantry cranes installed. These cranes, specialized for container work, are able to roll forward and aft on rails. In addition to the additional capital expense and maintenance costs, these cranes generally load and discharge containers much more slowly than their shoreside counterparts.

The introduction and improvement of shoreside container cranes have been a key to the success of the container ship. The first crane that was specifically designed for container work was built in California&#x27;s Port of Alameda in 1959. By the 1980s, shoreside gantry cranes were capable of moving containers on a 3-minute-cycle, or up to 400 tons per hour. In March 2010, at Port Klang in Malaysia, a new world record was set when 734 container moves were made in a single hour. The record was achieved using 9 cranes to simultaneously load and unload , a ship with a capacity of 9,600 TEU.

Vessels in the 1,500–2,499 TEU range are the most likely size class to have cranes, with more than 60% of this category being geared ships. Slightly less than a third of the very smallest ships (from 100–499 TEU) are geared, and almost no ships with a capacity of over 4,000 TEU are geared.

===Cargo holds===
Efficiency has always been key in the design of container ships. While containers may be carried on conventional break-bulk ships, cargo holds for dedicated container ships are specially constructed to speed loading and unloading, and to efficiently keep containers secure while at sea. A key aspect of container ship specialization is the design of the hatches, the openings from the main deck to the cargo holds. The hatch openings stretch the entire breadth of the cargo holds, and are surrounded by a raised steel structure known as the &quot;hatch coaming&quot;. On top of the hatch coamings are the hatch covers. Until the 1950s, hatches were typically secured with wooden boards and tarpaulins held down with battens. Today, some hatch covers can be solid metal plates that are lifted on and off the ship by cranes, while others are articulated mechanisms that are opened and closed using powerful hydraulic rams.

Another key component of dedicated container-ship design is the use of &quot;cell guides&quot;. Cell guides are strong vertical structures constructed of metal installed into a ship&#x27;s cargo holds. These structures guide containers into well-defined rows during loading and provide some support for containers against the ship&#x27;s rolling at sea. So fundamental to container ship design are cell guides that organizations such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development use their presence to distinguish dedicated container ships from general break-bulk cargo ships.

A system of three dimensions is used in cargo plans to describe the position of a container aboard the ship. The first coordinate is the &quot;bay&quot;, which starts at the front of the ship and increases aft. The second coordinate is the &quot;row&quot;. Rows on the starboard side are given odd numbers and those on the port side are given even numbers. The rows nearest the centerline are given low numbers, and the numbers increase for slots further from the centerline. The third coordinate is the &quot;tier&quot;, with the first tier at the bottom of the cargo holds, the second tier on top of that, and so forth.

Container ships typically take 20 foot and 40 foot containers. Some ships can take 45 footers above deck. A few ships (APL since 2007, Carrier53 since 2022 ) can carry 53 foot containers. 40 foot containers are the primary container size, making up about 90% of all container shipping and since container shipping moves 90% of the world&#x27;s freight, over 80% of the world&#x27;s freight moves via 40 foot containers.

===Lashing systems===
Numerous systems are used to secure containers aboard ships, depending on factors such as the type of ship, the type of container, and the location of the container. Stowage inside the holds of fully cellular (FC) ships is simplest, typically using simple metal forms called container guides, locating cones, and anti-rack spacers to lock the containers together. Above-decks, without the extra support of the cell guides, more complicated equipment is used. Three types of systems are currently in wide use: lashing systems, locking systems, and buttress systems. Lashing systems secure containers to the ship using devices made from wire rope, rigid rods, or chains and devices to tension the lashings, such as turnbuckles. The effectiveness of lashings is increased by securing containers to each other, either by simple metal forms (such as stacking cones) or more complicated devices such as twist-lock stackers. A typical twist-lock is inserted into the casting hole of one container and rotated to hold it in place, then another container is lowered on top of it. The two containers are locked together by twisting the device&#x27;s handle. A typical twist-lock is constructed of forged steel and ductile iron and has a shear strength of 48 tonnes.

The buttress system, used on some large container ships, uses a system of large towers attached to the ship at both ends of each cargo hold. As the ship is loaded, a rigid, removable stacking frame is added, structurally securing each tier of containers together.

===Bridge===
Container ships have typically had a single bridge and accommodation unit towards the rear, but to reconcile demand for larger container capacity with SOLAS visibility requirements, several new designs have been developed. , some large container ships are being developed with the bridge further forward, separate from the exhaust stack. Some smaller container ships working in European ports and rivers have liftable wheelhouses, which can be lowered to pass under low bridges.

==Fleet characteristics==


, container ships made up 13.3% of the world&#x27;s fleet in terms of deadweight tonnage. The world&#x27;s total of container ship deadweight tonnage has increased from in 1980 to in 2010. The combined deadweight tonnage of container ships and general cargo ships, which also often carry containers, represents 21.8% of the world&#x27;s fleet.

, the average age of container ships worldwide was 10.6 years, making them the youngest general vessel type, followed by bulk carriers at 16.6 years, oil tankers at 17 years, general cargo ships at 24.6 years, and others at 25.3 years.

Most of the world&#x27;s carrying capacity in fully cellular container ships is in the liner service, where ships trade on scheduled routes. As of January 2010, the top 20 liner companies controlled 67.5% of the world&#x27;s fully cellular container capacity, with 2,673 vessels of an average capacity of 3,774 TEU. The remaining 6,862 fully cellular ships have an average capacity of 709 TEU each.

The vast majority of the capacity of fully cellular container ships used in the liner trade is owned by German shipowners, with approximately 75% owned by Hamburg brokers. It is a common practice for the large container lines to supplement their own ships with chartered-in ships, for example in 2009, 48.9% of the tonnage of the top 20 liner companies was chartered-in in this manner.

===Flag states===
International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country, called its flag state. A ship&#x27;s flag state exercises regulatory control over the vessel and is required to inspect it regularly, certify the ship&#x27;s equipment and crew, and issue safety and pollution prevention documents. , the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics count 2,837 container ships of or greater worldwide. Panama was the world&#x27;s largest flag state for container ships, with 541 of the vessels in its registry. Seven other flag states had more than 100 registered container ships: Liberia (415), Germany (248), Singapore (177), Cyprus (139), the Marshall Islands (118) and the United Kingdom (104). The Panamanian, Liberian, and Marshallese flags are open registries and considered by the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation to be flags of convenience. By way of comparison, traditional maritime nations such as the United States and Japan only had 75 and 11 registered container ships, respectively.

===Vessel purchases===

In recent years, oversupply of container ship capacity has caused prices for new and used ships to fall. From 2008 to 2009, new container ship prices dropped by 19–33%, while prices for 10-year-old container ships dropped by 47–69%. In March 2010, the average price for a geared 500-TEU container ship was $10 million, while gearless ships of 6,500 and 12,000 TEU averaged prices of $74 million and $105 million respectively. At the same time, secondhand prices for 10-year-old geared container ships of 500-, 2,500-, and 3,500-TEU capacity averaged prices of $4 million, $15 million, and $18 million respectively.

In 2009, 11,669,000 gross tons of newly built container ships were delivered. Over 85% of this new capacity was built in the Republic of Korea, China, and Japan, with Korea accounting for over 57% of the world&#x27;s total alone. New container ships accounted for 15% of the total new tonnage that year, behind bulk carriers at 28.9% and oil tankers at 22.6%.

===Scrapping===
Most ships are removed from the fleet through a process known as scrapping. Scrapping is rare for ships under 18 years old and common for those over 40 years in age. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship&#x27;s empty weight (called light ton displacement or LTD) and prices in the scrap metal market. Scrapping rates are volatile, the price per light ton displacement has swung from a high of $650 per LTD in mid-2008 to $200 per LTD in early 2009, before building to $400 per LTD in March 2010. , over 96% of the world&#x27;s scrapping activity takes place in China, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.

The global economic downturn of 2008–2009 resulted in more ships than usual being sold for scrap. In 2009, 364,300 TEU worth of container ship capacity was scrapped, up from 99,900 TEU in 2008. Container ships accounted for 22.6% of the total gross tonnage of ships scrapped that year. Despite the surge, the capacity removed from the fleet only accounted for 3% of the world&#x27;s container ship capacity. The average age of container ships scrapped in 2009 was 27.0 years.

===Largest ships===

Economies of scale have dictated an upward trend in the size of container ships in order to reduce expenses. However, there are certain limitations to the size of container ships. Primarily, these are the availability of sufficiently large main engines and the availability of a sufficient number of ports and terminals prepared and equipped to handle ultra-large container ships. Furthermore, the permissible maximum ship dimensions in some of the world&#x27;s main waterways could present an upper limit in terms of vessel growth. This primarily concerns the Suez Canal and the Singapore Strait.

In 2008 the South Korean shipbuilder STX announced plans to construct a container ship capable of carrying , and with a proposed length of and a beam of . If constructed, the container ship would become the largest seagoing vessel in the world.

Since even very large container ships are vessels with relatively low draft compared to large tankers and bulk carriers, there is still considerable room for vessel growth. Compared to today&#x27;s largest container ships, Maersk Line&#x27;s &quot;Emma Mærsk&quot;-type series, a container ship would only be moderately larger in terms of exterior dimensions. According to a 2011 estimate, an ultra-large container ship of would measure , compared to for the &quot;Emma Mærsk&quot; class. It would have an estimated deadweight of circa 220,000 tons. While such a vessel might be near the upper limit for a Suez Canal passage, the so-called Malaccamax concept (for Straits of Malacca) does not apply for container ships, since the Malacca and Singapore Straits&#x27; draft limit of about is still above that of any conceivable container ship design. In 2011, Maersk announced plans to build a new &quot;Triple E&quot; family of container ships with a capacity of 18,000 TEU, with an emphasis on lower fuel consumption.

In the present market situation, main engines will not be as much of a limiting factor for vessel growth either. The steadily rising expense of fuel oil in the early 2010s had prompted most container lines to adapt a slower, more economical voyage speed of about 21 knots, compared to earlier top speeds of 25 or more knots. Subsequently, newly built container ships can be fitted with a smaller main engine. Engine types fitted to today&#x27;s ships of are thus sufficiently large to propel future vessels of or more. Maersk Line, the world&#x27;s largest container shipping line, nevertheless opted for twin engines (two smaller engines working two separate propellers), when ordering a series of ten 18,000 TEU vessels from Daewoo Shipbuilding in February 2011. The ships were delivered between 2013 and 2014. In 2016, some experts believed that the current largest container ships are at the optimum size, and could not economically be larger, as port facilities would be too expensive, port handling too time consuming, the number of suitable ports too low, and insurance cost too high.

In March 2017 the first ship with an official capacity over 20,000 TEUs was christened at Samsung Heavy Industries. &quot;MOL Triumph&quot; has a capacity of 20,150 TEUs. Samsung Heavy Industries was expected to deliver several ships of over 20,000 TEUs in 2017, and has orders for at least ten vessels in that size range for OOCL and MOL.

The world&#x27;s largest container ship, &quot;MSC Irina&quot;, was delivered March 9, 2023 by builder Yangzi Xinfu Shipbuilding to the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), with a capacity of 24,346 TEUs. Measuring 399.99 metres in length and 61.3 metres in beam, the ship is one of four ordered from the builder in 2020, and exceeded MSC&#x27;s 24,116 TEU &quot;MSC Tessa&quot;, which had been delivered that same day by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). In April, &quot;MSC Irina&quot; sister ship &quot;MSC Loreto&quot;, with an equal capacity of 24,346 TEU was received by MSC.

On June 2, 2023 Ocean Network Express took delivery of the &quot;ONE Innovation&quot; with a capacity of 24,136 TEUs. &quot;ONE Innovation&quot; is one of six new Megamax vessels ordered by Ocean Network Express in December 2020 to be built by a consortium of Imabari Shipbuilding and Japan Marine United.

===Freight market===
The act of hiring a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. Outside special bulk cargo markets, ships are hired by three types of charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, and the bareboat charter. In a voyage charter, the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a time charter, the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter, the charterer acts as the ship&#x27;s operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. The completed chartering contract is known as a charter party.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD], tracks in its 2010 &quot;Review of Maritime Trade&quot; two aspects of container shipping prices: The first one is a chartering price, specifically the price to time-charter a 1 TEU slot for 14 tonnes of cargo on a container ship. The other is the freight rate; or comprehensive daily cost to deliver one-TEU worth of cargo on a given route. As a result of the late-2000s recession, both indicators showed sharp drops during 2008–2009, and have shown signs of stabilization since 2010.

UNCTAD uses the Hamburg Shipbrokers&#x27; Association (formally the &quot;Vereinigung Hamburger Schiffsmakler und Schiffsagenten e. V.&quot; or VHSS for short) as its main industry source for container ship freight prices. The VHSS maintains a few indices of container ship charter prices. The oldest, which dates back to 1998, is called the &quot;Hamburg Index&quot;. This index considers time-charters on fully cellular container ships controlled by Hamburg brokers. It is limited to charters of 3 months or more, and presented as the average daily cost in U.S. dollars for a one-TEU slot with a weight of 14 tonnes. The Hamburg Index data is divided into ten categories based primarily on vessel carrying capacity. Two additional categories exist for small vessels of under 500 TEU that carry their own cargo cranes. In 2007, VHSS started another index, the &quot;New ConTex&quot; which tracks similar data obtained from an international group of shipbrokers.

The Hamburg Index shows some clear trends in recent chartering markets. First, rates were generally increasing from 2000 to 2005. From 2005 to 2008, rates slowly decreased, and in mid-2008 began a &quot;dramatic decline&quot; of approximately 75%, which lasted until rates stabilized in April 2009. Rates have ranged from $2.70 to $35.40 in this period, with prices generally lower on larger ships. The most resilient sized vessel in this time period were those from 200 to 300 TEU, a fact that the United Nations Council on Trade and Development attributes to lack of competition in this sector. Overall, in 2010, these rates rebounded somewhat, but remained at approximately half of their 2008 values. As of 2011, the index shows signs of recovery for container shipping, and combined with increases in global capacity, indicates a positive outlook for the sector in the near future.

UNCTAD also tracks container freight rates. Freight rates are expressed as the total price in U.S. dollars for a shipper to transport one TEU worth of cargo along a given route. Data is given for the three main container liner routes: U.S.-Asia, U.S.-Europe, and Europe-Asia. Prices are typically different between the two legs of a voyage, for example the Asia-U.S. rates have been significantly higher than the return U.S.-Asia rates in recent years. Generally, from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009, both the volume of container cargo and freight rates have dropped sharply. In 2009, the freight rates on the U.S.–Europe route were sturdiest, while the Asia-U.S. route fell the most.

Liner companies responded to their overcapacity in several ways. For example, in early 2009, some container lines dropped their freight rates to zero on the Asia-Europe route, charging shippers only a surcharge to cover operating costs. They decreased their overcapacity by lowering the ships&#x27; speed (a strategy called &quot;slow steaming&quot;) and by laying up ships. Slow steaming increased the length of the Europe-Asia routes to a record high of over 40 days. Another strategy used by some companies was to manipulate the market by publishing notices of rate increases in the press, and when &quot;a notice had been issued by one carrier, other carriers followed suit&quot;.

The Trans-Siberian Railroad (TSR) has recently become a more viable alternative to container ships on the Asia-Europe route. This railroad can typically deliver containers in 1/3 to 1/2 of the time of a sea voyage, and in late 2009 announced a 20% reduction in its container shipping rates. With its 2009 rate schedule, the TSR will transport a forty-foot container to Poland from Yokohama for $2,820, or from Pusan for $2,154.

===Shipping industry alliances===
In an effort to control costs and maximize capacity utilization on ever-larger ships, vessel sharing agreements, co-operative agreements, and slot-exchanges have become a growing feature of the maritime container shipping industry. As of March 2015, 16 of the world&#x27;s largest container shipping lines had consolidated their routes and services accounting for 95 percent of container cargo volumes moving in the dominant east-west trade routes. Carriers remain operationally independent, as they are forbidden by antitrust regulators in multiple jurisdictions from colluding on freight rates or capacity. Similarities can be drawn with airline alliances.

In July 2016 the European Commission reported that it had raised concerns with 14 container shipping carriers regarding their practice of announcing General Rate Increases (GRIs) in a coordinated manner, which potentially conflicted with the EU and EEA rules on concerted practices which could distort competition (Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). The shipping companies announced a series of commitments aiming to address the Commission&#x27;s concerns, which for its part the Commission accepted as &quot;legally binding&quot; for the period from 2016 to 2019. General Rate Increases continue to be published in the industry either annually or sixth-monthly.

==Container ports==

Container traffic through a port is often tracked in terms of twenty foot equivalent units or TEU of throughput. , the Port of Shanghai was the world&#x27;s busiest container port, with 43,303,000 TEU handled.

That year, seven of the busiest ten container ports were in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with Shanghai in 1st place, Ningbo 3rd, Shenzhen 4th, Guangzhou 5th, Qingdao 7th, Hong Kong 8th and Tianjin 9th.

Rounding out the top ten ports were Singapore at 2nd, Busan in South Korea at 6th and Rotterdam in the Netherlands in the 10th position.

In total, the busiest twenty container ports handled 220,905,805 TEU in 2009, almost half of the world&#x27;s total estimated container traffic that year of 465,597,537 TEU.

==Losses and safety problems==
It has been estimated that container ships lose between 2,000 and 10,000 containers at sea each year, costing $370 million. A survey for the six years 2008 through 2013 estimates average losses of individual containers overboard at 546 per year, and average total losses including catastrophic events such as vessel sinkings or groundings at 1,679 per year More recently, a survey conducted by the WSC from 2008–2019, saw an average of 1,382 shipping containers lost at sea. However, in the 3-year period from 2017–2019, that number was nearly halved, down to an average of 779 containers lost annually. Most go overboard on the open sea during storms but there are some examples of whole ships being lost with their cargo. One major shipping accident occurred in 2013 when the MOL Comfort sank with 4,293 containers onboard in the Indian Ocean. When containers are dropped, they immediately become an environmental threat – termed &quot;marine debris&quot;. Once in the ocean, they fill with water and sink if the contents cannot hold air. Rough waters smash the container, sinking it quickly.

As container ships get larger and stacking becomes higher, the threat of containers toppling into the sea during a storm increases. This results from a phenomenon called &quot;parametric rolling,&quot; by which a ship can roll 30-40 degrees during rough seas creating a powerful torque on a 10-high stack of containers which can easily snap lashings and locks of the stack, resulting in losses into the sea.

<text>The Suva, headquartered in Lucerne, is the Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund. It is a public-sector insurer and leading provider of health care coverage for employees in case of accidents in Switzerland.

== Name ==

The name is the abbreviation of &quot;Schweizerische Unfallversicherungsanstalt&quot; (German for &quot;Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund&quot;, in French &quot;Caisse nationale suisse d&#x27;assurance en cas d&#x27;accidents&quot; or CNA; in Italian &quot;Istituto nazionale svizzero di assicurazione contro gli infortuni&quot;).

== History ==

It was founded 1912 and its active since 1918. For a long time, it held a monopoly for compulsory coverage for employees in high-risk professions. Its surplus income is distributed to insureds in the form of premium reductions.

Its three missions are prevention, insurance and rehabilitation. About half of people working in Switzerland are insurance by the Suva in case of accidents (128,000 companies and 2,000,000 people insured).

Unemployed people are insured against accidents by the Suva. Since 2005, the Swiss Armed Forces are also insured against accidents by the Suva.

<doc id="262088" wikidata="Q5608822" url="?curid=262088" title="Thomas Churchyard">
<text>Thomas Churchyard (c. 1523 – 1604) was an English author and soldier. He is chiefly remembered for a series of autobiographical or semi-autobiographical verse collections, including &quot;Churchyardes Chippes&quot; (1575); &quot;Churchyard&#x27;s Choise&quot; (1579); &quot;Churchyardes Charge&quot; (1580); &quot;The Worthines of Wales&quot; (1587); &quot;Churchyard&#x27;s Challenge&quot; (1593); and &quot;Churchyards Charitie&quot; (1595).

==Early life==
Thomas Churchyard was born at Shrewsbury in c. 1529, the son of a farmer. He received a good education, and, having speedily dissipated at court the money with which his father provided him, he entered the household of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. There he remained for twenty years, learning something of the art of poetry from his patron; some of the poems he contributed later (1555) to Nicholas Grimald&#x27;s and Richard Tottel&#x27;s collection, &quot;Songes and Sonettes&quot; (known more often as &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;), may well date from this early period.

==Career==
In 1541 Churchyard began his career as a soldier of fortune, being, he said, &quot;pressed into the service&quot;. He fought his way through nearly every campaign in Scotland and the Low Countries for thirty years. He served under the emperor Charles V in Flanders in 1542, returning to England after the Peace of Crépy (1544).

In the Scottish campaign of 1547 he was present at the barren victory of Pinkie, and in the next year was taken prisoner at Saint Monance, but aided by his persuasive tongue he escaped to the English garrison at Lauder, where he was once more besieged, only returning to England on the conclusion of peace in 1550.

In the same year he went to Ireland to serve the lord deputy of Ireland, Sir Anthony St Leger, who had been sent to pacify the country. Here Churchyard enriched himself, at the expense of the Irish; but in 1552 he was in England again, trying vainly to secure a fortune by marriage with a rich widow. After this failure he departed once more to the wars to the Siege of Metz (1552), and &quot;trailed a pike&quot; in the emperor&#x27;s army, until he joined the forces under William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton, with whom he says he served eight years. Grey was in charge of the fortress of Guînes, which was besieged by the duke of Guise in 1558.

Churchyard arranged the terms of surrender, and was sent with his chief to Paris as a prisoner. He was not released at the Peace of Cateau Cambrésis for lack of money to pay his ransom, but he was finally set free on giving his bond for the amount, an engagement which he repudiated as soon as he was safely in England. He is not to be identified with the &quot;T.C.&quot; who wrote for the &quot;Mirror for Magistrates&quot; (ed. 1559), &quot;How the Lord Mowbray ... was banished ... and after died miserablie in exile&quot;, which is the work of Thomas Chaloner; but &quot;Shore&#x27;s Wife&quot;, his most popular poem, appeared in the 1563 edition of the same work, and to that of 1587 he contributed the &quot;Tragedie of Thomas Wolsey&quot;. These are plain compositions in the seven-lined Chaucerian stanza.

Repeated petitions to the Queen for assistance produced at first fair words, and then no answer at all. He therefore returned to active service under Lord Grey, who was in command of an English army sent in 1560 to help the Scottish rebels at the Siege of Leith, and in 1564 he served in Ireland under Sir Henry Sidney. The religious disturbances in the Netherlands attracted him to Antwerp, where, as the agent of William of Orange, he allowed the insurgents to place him at their head, and was able to save much property from destruction. This action made him so hated by the mob that he had to fly for his life in the disguise of a priest. In the next year he was sent by the earl of Oxford to serve definitely under the prince of Orange. After a year&#x27;s service he obtained leave to return to England, and after many adventures and narrow escapes in a journey through hostile territory he embarked for Guernsey, and thence for England. His patron, Lord Oxford, disowned him, and the poet, whose health was failing, retired to Bath. He appears to have made a very unhappy marriage at this time, and returned to the Low Countries. Falling into the hands of the Spaniards he was recognized as having had a hand in the Antwerp disturbance, and was under sentence to be executed as a spy when he was saved by the intervention of a noble lady. This experience did not deter him from joining in the defence of Zutphen in 1572, but this was his last campaign, and the troubles of the remaining years of his life were chiefly domestic.

==Later life==
Churchyard was employed to devise a pageant for the Queen&#x27;s reception at Bristol in 1574, and again at Norwich in 1578. He had published in 1575 &quot;The Firste parte of Churchyarde&#x27;s Chippes&quot;, the modest title which he gives to his works. No second part appeared, but there was a much enlarged edition in 1578. A passage in &quot;Churchyarde&#x27;s Choise&quot; (1579) gave offence to Elizabeth, and the author fled to Scotland, where he remained for three years. He was only restored to favour about 1584, and in 1593 he received a small pension from the Queen.

On Good Friday, 8 April 1580, Churchyard (then aged nearly 60) published a short account of the earthquake which had struck London and much of England only two days earlier. The pamphlet, &quot;A Warning to the Wyse, a Feare to the Fond, a Bridle to the Lewde, and a Glasse to the Good; written of the late Earthquake chanced in London and other places, 6 April 1580, for the Glory of God and benefit of men, that warely can walk, and wisely judge. Set forth in verse and prose, by Thomas Churchyard, gentleman&quot; provides the earliest accounts of the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake.

==Dispute with Thomas Camel==
In &quot;Churchyards Challenge&quot; (1593) the author refers to his broadside ballad, &quot;Davie Dicars dreame&quot; (–1552), which he says was written against by one Thomas Camel whom Churchyard then &quot;openly confuted&quot;. Their argument came to involve not only Churchyard and Camel but also William Waterman, Geoffrey Chappell, and Richard Beard. All their various contributions were collected and reprinted in in 1560. A short and seemingly alliterative poem in the manner of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, &quot;Davie Dicar&quot; brought Churchyard into trouble with the privy council, but he was supported by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset and dismissed with a reprimand.

Carried out in broadside ballads, the Churchyard-Camel debate was concerned with the relative merit of the plain style in native English literary tradition and the proper literary use of the English language itself. In a verse dedication to John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Pithy Pleasaunt and Profitable Workes&quot; (1568), Churchyard defended the native tradition, grounding it in &quot;Peers plowman . . . full plaine&quot; and Chaucer. Churchyard mocked Camel&#x27;s classical, Latinate sophistication, and Camel attacked Churchyard&#x27;s churlish words and &quot;uncouth speeche&quot;. This public controversy resembled the old medieval practice of flyting—a staged, collaborative battle of the wits that was also, in this case, an occasion for the public discussion of moral issues, education, religion, and politics. It was also a means of commercial self-promotion on the part of writers and printers.

Perhaps inspired by Robert Crowley&#x27;s 1550 publication of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, Davy Dycar (i.e., Davy the ditcher or digger) is a character drawn from a line at the end of &quot;Passus 6&quot; in the B-text and the end of &quot;Passus 9&quot; in the C-text where it is prophesied that &quot;Dawe the dyker&quot; will die of starvation because of the corruption of landlords and clergy. (&quot;Dawe&quot;, written or printed as &quot;Davve&quot;, could be read as &quot;Davy&quot; or &quot;Davie&quot;.) This is the concluding event in a list of disasters caused by corrupt elites, a part of &quot;Piers Plowman&quot; that was appreciated by some English Protestants in the mid-sixteenth century. (Notably, the Davy Digger lines were copied into a manuscript of political prophecies compiled around 1553–1554.) Churchyard turns Davy into a Piers-like truth-teller and prophet of a millennial kingdom of justice:

William Waterman added to the debate with his &quot;Westerne Wyll&quot;, calling explicit attention to Davy&#x27;s roots:

==Reputation==
The affectionate esteem with which Churchyard was regarded by the younger Elizabethan writers is expressed by Thomas Nashe, who says (&quot;Foure Letters Confuted&quot;) that Churchyard&#x27;s aged muse might well be &quot;grandmother to our grandiloquentest poets at this present&quot;. Francis Meres (&quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, 1598) mentions him in conjunction with many great names among &quot;the most passionate, among us, to bewail and bemoan the perplexities of love&quot;. Spenser, in &quot;Colin Clout&#x27;s Come Home Again&quot;, calls him with a spice of raillery &quot;old Palaemon&quot; who &quot;sung so long until quite hoarse he grew&quot;.

His writings, with the exception of his contributions to the &quot;Mirror for Magistrates&quot;, are chiefly autobiographical in character or deal with the wars in which he had a share. They are very rare and have never been completely reprinted. Churchyard lived right through Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, and was buried in St. Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, on 4 April 1604. It was said he was taken ill in the presence of Anne of Denmark&#x27;s ladies in waiting and carried away in a faint a fortnight before his death.

==Works==
The extant works of Churchyard, exclusive of commendatory and occasional verses, include:
*&quot;A lamentable and pitifull Description of the wofull warres in Flanders&quot; (1578)
*&quot;A Prayse, and Reporte of Maister MartyneFrobishers Voyage to Meta Incognita (A Name Given by a Mightie and most Great Personage) in Which Praise and Report is Written Divers Discourses Never Published by any Man as Yet&quot; (1578)
*&quot;A general rehearsall of warres, called Churchyard&#x27;s Choise&quot; (1579), really a completion of the &quot;Chippes&quot;, and containing, like it, a number of detached pieces
*&quot;A light Bondel of livelie Discourses&quot;, called &quot;Churchyardes Charge&quot; (1580)
*&quot;A Warning to the Wyse&quot;, an immediate account of England&#x27;s 1580 earthquake (1580)
*&quot;The Worthines of Wales&quot; (1587), a valuable antiquarian work in prose and verse, anticipating Michael Drayton
*&quot;Churchyard&#x27;s Challenge&quot; (1593)
*&quot;A Musicall Consort of Heavenly harmonic&quot;, called &quot;Churchyards Charitie&quot; (1595)
*&quot;A True Discourse Historicall, of the succeeding Governors in the Netherlands&quot; (1602)

The chief contemporary authority for Churchyard&#x27;s biography is his own &quot;Tragicall Discourse of the unhappy man&#x27;s life&quot; (&quot;Churchyardes Chippes&quot;). George Chalmers published (1817) a selection from his works relating to Scotland, for which he wrote a useful life. See also an edition of the &quot;Chippes&quot; (ed. JP Collier, 1870), of the &quot;Worthines of Wales&quot; (Spenser Soc., 1876), and a notice of Churchyard by H. W. Adnitt (&quot;Transactions of the Shropshire Archaeological and Natural History Society&quot;, reprinted separately 1884).

<text>Francis Meres (1565/1566 – 29 January 1647) was an English churchman and author. His 1598 commonplace book includes the first critical account of poems and plays by Shakespeare.

==Career==
Francis Meres was born in 1565 at Kirton Meres in the parish of Kirton, Lincolnshire. He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he received a BA in 1587 and an MA in 1591. Two years later he was incorporated an MA of Oxford. His relative, John Meres, was high sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1596, and apparently helped him in the early part of his career. In 1602 he became rector of Wing, Rutland, where he also ran a school. Both his son Francis and his grandson Edward received their BA and MA from Cambridge and became rectors.

Meres is especially known for his &quot;Palladis Tamia, Wits Treasury&quot; (1598), a commonplace book that is important as a source on the Elizabethan poets, and more particularly as the first critical account of the poems and early plays of William Shakespeare. Its list of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays contributed to establishing their chronology.

The &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; also contained moral and critical reflections borrowed from various sources, and embraced sections on books, on philosophy, on music and painting, and a &quot;Comparative Discourse of our English poets with the Greeke, Latin, and Italian poets.&quot; This chapter enumerates the English poets from Chaucer to Meres&#x27;s own day, and in each case a comparison with some classical author is instituted.

A sermon entitled &quot;Gods Arithmeticke&quot; (1597) and two translations from the Spanish of Luís de Granada entitled &quot;Granada&#x27;s Devotion and The Sinners&#x27; Guide&quot; (1598) complete Meres&#x27;s list of works.

==Marriage and issue==
Meres had a wife, Mary (1576/1577–1631), whose maiden name is unknown. They had a son, Francis, born in 1607. In &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; (1904), Charlotte Stopes stated that Meres was the brother-in-law of John Florio, but investigations by George Greenwood suggest Stopes erred in that claim.

Meres died in 1647 and was buried in the parish Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wing, Rutland.

<text>The theorbo is a plucked string instrument of the lute family, with an extended neck that houses the second pegbox. Like a lute, a theorbo has a curved-back sound box with a flat top, typically with one or three sound holes decorated with rosettes. As with the lute, the player plucks or strums the strings with the right hand while &quot;fretting&quot; (pressing down) the strings with the left hand.

The theorbo is related to the &quot;liuto attiorbato&quot;, the French &quot;&quot;, the archlute, the German baroque lute, and the &quot;angélique&quot; (or &quot;angelica&quot;). A theorbo differs from a regular lute in its re-entrant tuning in which the first two strings are tuned an octave lower. The theorbo was used during the Baroque music era (1600–1750) to play basso continuo accompaniment parts (as part of the basso continuo group, which often included harpsichord, pipe organ and bass instruments), and also as a solo instrument. It has a range similar to that of cello.

==Origin and development==
Theorbos were developed during the late sixteenth century in Italy, inspired by the demand for extended bass range instruments for use in the then-newly developed musical style of opera developed by the Florentine Camerata and new musical works utilising basso continuo, such as Giulio Caccini&#x27;s two collections, &quot;Le nuove musiche&quot; (1602 and 1614). For his 1607 opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, Claudio Monteverdi lists &quot;duoi&quot; (two) &quot;chitaroni&quot; among the instruments required for performing the work. Musicians originally used large bass lutes (c. + string length) and a higher re-entrant tuning, but soon created neck extensions with secondary pegboxes to accommodate extra open (&quot;i.e.&quot; unfretted) longer bass strings, called &quot;diapasons&quot; or &quot;bourdons&quot;, for improvements in tonal clarity and an increased range of available notes.

Although the words &quot;chitarrone&quot; and &quot;tiorba&quot; were both used to describe the instrument, they have different organological and etymological origins; chitarrone being in Italian an augmentation of (and literally meaning large) chitarra – Italian for guitar. The round-backed chitarra was still in use, often referred to as &quot;chitarra Italiana&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;chitarra alla spagnola&quot; in its new flat-backed Spanish incarnation. The etymology of &quot;tiorba&quot; is still obscure; it is hypothesized the origin may be in Slavic or Turkish &quot;torba&quot;, meaning &#x27;bag&#x27; or &#x27;turban&#x27;.

According to Athanasius Kircher, &quot;tiorba&quot; was a nickname in the Neapolitan language for a grinding board used by perfumers for grinding essences and herbs. It is possible the appearance of this new large instrument (particularly in a crowded ensemble) resulted in jokes and a humour induced reference with popular local knowledge becoming lost over time and place. Robert Spencer has noted the confusion the two names were already leading to in 1600: &quot;Chitarone, ò Tiorba che si dica&quot; (chitarrone, or theorbo as it is called). By the mid-17th century, it would appear that &quot;tiorba&quot; had taken preference – reflected in modern practice, helping to distinguish the theorbo now from very different instruments like the &quot;chitarrone moderno&quot; or &quot;guitarrón&quot;. Similar adaptations to smaller lutes (c.  string length) also produced the &quot;arciliuto&quot; (archlute), &quot;liuto attiorbato&quot;, and &quot;tiorbino&quot;, which were differently tuned instruments to accommodate a new repertoire of small ensemble or solo works. In the performance of basso continuo, theorbos were often paired with a small pipe organ.

The most prominent early composers and players in Italy were Giovanni Girolamo Kapsperger and Alessandro Piccinini. Giuliano Paratico was another early Italian chitarrone player. Little solo music survives from England, but William Lawes and others used theorbos in chamber ensembles and opera orchestras. In France, theorbos were appreciated and used in orchestral or chamber music until the second half of the 18th century (Nicolas Hotman, Robert de Visée). Court orchestras in Vienna, Bayreuth and Berlin still employed theorbo players after 1750 (Ernst Gottlieb Baron, Francesco Conti). Solo music for the theorbo is notated in tablature, a form of music notation in which the frets and strings which a player must press down are printed on a series of parallel lines which represent the strings on the fretboard.

==Tuning and strings==

The tuning of large theorbos is characterized by the octave displacement, or &quot;re-entrant tuning&quot;, of the two uppermost strings. Piccinini and Michael Praetorius mention the occasional use of metal strings (brass and steel, as opposed to gut strings). The &quot; Testudo Theorbata&quot; that appears in &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot; by Praetorius, has doubled strings (courses) passing over the bridge and attached to the base of the instrument – different to his &#x27; (opposite in the same illustration which seems to have single strings). The &#x27; also appears to have single strings attached to the bridge. The string &quot;courses&quot;, unlike those of a Renaissance lute or archlute, were often single, although double stringing was also used. Typically, theorbos have 14 courses, though some used 15 or even 19 courses (Kapsberger).

This is theorbo tuning in A. Modern theorbo players usually play 14-course (string) instruments (lowest course is G). Some players have used a theorbo tuned a whole step lower in G. Most of the solo repertoire is in the A tuning. The &quot;re-entrant tuning&quot; created new possibilities for voice leading and inspired a new right-hand technique with just thumb, index and middle fingers to arpeggiate chords, which Piccinini likened to the sound of a harp. The bass tessitura (range) and re-entrant stringing mean that in order to keep the figured bass &quot;realisation&quot; (the improvised playing of chords) above the bass instruments when accompanying basso continuo, the bassline must sometimes be played an octave lower (Kapsberger). In the French treatises, chords in which a lower note sounds after the bass were also used when the bass goes high. The English theorbo had just the first string at the lower octave (Thomas Mace).

== Regional differences ==

=== Italy ===
The theorbo was developed in Italy, and so has a rich legacy in Italian music as both a solo and continuo instrument. Caccini comments in &quot;Le nuove musiche&quot; (1602) that the theorbo is perfectly suited for accompanying the voice as it can give a very full support without being obscured by the vocalist, indicating the beginning of an Italian tradition of monodic songs accompanied by theorbo. Italians called the theorbo&#x27;s diapasons its &quot;special excellence&quot;. Italians viewed the theorbo as an easier alternative to the lute since the general attractiveness of its sound quality can cover over indifferent playing and lazy voice leading.

=== England ===

The Italian theorbo first came to England at the beginning of the seventeenth century, but an alternate design based on the English two-headed lute, designed by Jaques Gaultier, soon became more popular. English theorbos were generally tuned in G and double strung throughout, with only the first course in reentrant tuning. Theorbos tuned in G were much better suited to flat keys, and so many English songs or consort pieces that involved theorbo were written in flat keys that would be very difficult to play on a theorbo in A. By the eighteenth century, the theorbo had fallen out of fashion in England due to its large size and low pitch. It was replaced by the archlute.

=== France ===
The first mention of a theorbo in France was in 1637, and by the 1660s it had replaced the 10-course lute as the most popular accompanying instrument. The theorbo was a very important continuo instrument in the French court and multiple French theorbo continuo tutors (method books) were published by Delair (1690), Campion (1716 and 1730), Bartolotti (1669), Fleury (1660), and Grenerin (1670). French theorbos had up to eight stopped strings and were often somewhat smaller and quieter than Italian theorbos. They were a standard scale length of , which made them smaller than Italian instruments, which ranged from .

=== Germany ===
German theorbos would also today be called swan-necked Baroque lutes; seventeenth-century German theorbists played single-strung instruments in the Italian tuning transposed down a whole step, but eighteenth-century players switched to double-strung instruments in the &quot;d-minor&quot; tuning used in French and German Baroque lute music so as to not have to rethink their chord shapes when playing theorbo. These instruments came to be referred to as theorbo-lutes. Baron remarks that &quot;the lute, because of its delicacy, serves well in trios or other chamber music with few participants. The theorbo, because of its power, serves best in groups of thirty to forty musicians, as in churches and operas.&quot; Theorbo-lutes would likely have been used alongside Italian theorbos and archlutes in continuo settings due to the presence of Italian musicians in German courts and also for the purpose of using instruments that were appropriate for whatever key the music was in.

=== Ukraine, Poland and Russia ===
The theorbo came to Ukraine ca. 1700 and it was upgraded with treble strings (known as prystrunky). This instrument was called a torban. The Torban was manufactured and used mainly in Ukraine, but also occasionally encountered in neighbouring Poland and Russia.

== Technique ==
The theorbo is played much like the lute, with the left hand pressing down on the fingerboard to vary the resonating length of the strings (thus playing different notes and making chords, basslines and melodies playable) while the right fingertips pluck the strings. The most significant differences between theorbo and lute technique are that theorbo is played with the right thumb outside the hand, as opposed to Renaissance lute which is played with the thumb under the hand. Additionally, the right hand thumb is entirely responsible for playing the bass diapasons and rarely comes up onto the top courses. Most theorbists play with the flesh of their fingers on the right hand, although there is some historical precedent from Piccinini, Mace, and Weiss to use nails. Fingernails can be more effective on a theorbo than on a lute due to its single-strung courses, and the use of nails is most often suggested in the context of ensemble playing where tone quality becomes subservient to volume.

== Solo repertoire ==
The theorbo&#x27;s solo Baroque repertoire came almost exclusively from Italy and France, with the exception of some English music written for the English theorbo, until the 21st century. The most effective and idiomatic music for the theorbo takes advantage of its two unique qualities: the diapasons and the reentrant tuning. Campanella passages that allow scale passages to ring across multiple strings in a harp-like fashion are particularly common and are a highly effective tool for the skilled theorbist/composer.

Italy: Kapsberger, Piccinini, Castaldi

* Toccatas - free, rhapsodic, harmonically adventurous. Piccinini&#x27;s are more harmonically tight while Kapsberger often breaks voice-leading rules in order to achieve the desired effect
* Dances - Correntes, Gagliardas, continuing in the tradition of Italian lute dances dating back to Dalza
* Variations - highly sophisticated and challenging variations on often very simple themes

France: de Visee, Bartolotti, Hurel, le Moyne

* Dance suites - the vast majority of French theorbo music consists of dance suites in the order of unmeasured prelude, allemande, courante, saraband, gigue (with variations)
* Transcriptions - French theorbists often transcribed pieces from opera composers such as Lully or keyboard composers such as Couperin to perform as solo pieces

A few modern composers have begun to write new music for the theorbo; significant works have been composed by Roman Turovsky, David Loeb, Bruno Helstroffer, Thomas Bocklenberg, and Stephen Goss, who has written the only concerto for theorbo.

== Continuo ==
The theorbo&#x27;s primary use was as a continuo instrument. However, due to its layout as a plucked instrument and its reentrant tuning, following strict voice leading parameters could sometimes be difficult or even impossible. Thus, a style of continuo unique to the theorbo was developed that incorporated these factors:

* Breaking voice leading rules to capitalize on voicings that better express the instrument&#x27;s natural sonority. The integrity of the true bass line is maintained through the use of creative arpeggiation that masks improper inversions.
* Frequent transposition of the bass line down an octave in order to play on the diapasons.
* Use of thinner textures; due to the theorbo&#x27;s strong projection and rich resonance, a three or even two voice accompaniment will often be just as effective as a standard four-voice accompaniment on a harpsichord. Additionally, playing more than a two-voice realization can become impossible with quick-moving bass lines.
* Frequent restriking of chords to make up for the instrument&#x27;s quick decay.

Thus, the preservation of the bass line and the sound of the instrument are of the highest priority when used as a continuo instrument. Breaking voice leading rules becomes necessary in order to preserve the bass line and bring out the unique tones of the theorbo.

The theorbo is labelled by Praetorius as both a fundamental and an ornamental continuo instrument, meaning it is capable of supporting an ensemble as a primary bass instrument while also fleshing out the harmony and adding color to the ensemble by means of chord realizations.

<text>Edward Arber (4 December 183623 November 1912) was an English scholar, writer, and editor.

==Background and professional work==
Arber was born in London. From 1854 he 1878 he worked as a clerk in the Admiralty, and began evening classes at King&#x27;s College London in 1858. In 1870 his address was No. 5 Queen Square, in Bloomsbury.

From 1878 to 1881 he studied English literature, under Henry Morley, at University College London; and from 1881 to 1894 he was professor of English at Mason College (which later became Birmingham University). From 1894 he lived in London as emeritus professor, being also a fellow of King&#x27;s College London. In 1905 he received the honorary degree of D. Litt. from the University of Oxford. He married Marion Murray in 1869, and had two sons, one of whom, E. A. N. Arber, became demonstrator in palaeobotany at the University of Cambridge.

==Scholarly edits==
As a scholarly editor, Arber made notable contributions to English literature. His name is associated particularly with the &quot;English Reprints&quot; series (1868–1871), by which an accurate text of the works of many English authors, formerly only accessible in more expensive editions, was placed within reach of the general public. Among the thirty volumes of the series were Stephen Gosson&#x27;s &quot;School of Abuse&quot;, Roger Ascham&#x27;s &quot;Toxophilus&quot;, &quot;Tottel&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;, and Robert Naunton&#x27;s &quot;Fragmenta Regalia&quot;. It was followed by the &quot;English Scholar&#x27;s Library&quot; (16 volumes) which included the &quot;Works&quot; (1884) of Captain John Smith, governor of Virginia, and the &quot;Poems&quot; (1882) of Richard Barnfield.

==Anthologies and bibliographies==
In his eight volume &quot;English Garner&quot; (1877–1890) Arber collected rare old tracts and poems, &quot;ingatherings from our history and literature&quot;. Between 1899 and 1901 he issued the ten volume &quot;British Anthologies&quot; set:
During and after the first World War, T.S. Eliot used to recommend &quot;The Shakespeare Anthology&quot; for students of his University Extension classes on Elizabethan Literature in London. In 1907 Arber began a series called &quot;A Christian Library&quot;. He was the sole editor of two vast English bibliographies: &quot;A Transcript of the Registers of the Stationers&#x27; Company&quot;, 1553–1640 (1875–1894), and &quot;The Term Catalogues&quot;, 1668–1709/11.

<text>Alpine folk music (; German&#x27;s &quot;Volksmusik&quot; means &quot;people&#x27;s music&quot; or as a Germanic connotative translation, &quot;folk&#x27;s music&quot;) is the common umbrella designation of a number of related styles of traditional folk music in the Alpine regions of Slovenia, Northern Croatia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and South Tyrol (Italy).

It tends to be dialect-heavy and invokes local and regional lifestyles, cultures and traditions, particularly, those of the Alpine farmers and peasants.

Originally transmitted by oral tradition, the oldest historical records like the Appenzell &quot;Kuhreihen&quot; by Georg Rhau (1488–1548) date back to the 16th century. Alpine folk is characterized by improvisation and variation, uncomplicated major key melodies and simple harmonies. Typical instruments range from alpenhorns to hackbretts, zithers and acoustic guitars, and even violas and harmonicas. Harmonized singing is frequent, but other pieces may require yodeling, while instrumental arrangements are particularly frequent for fast dances or brass pieces.

Alpine folk continues to be performed by many local ensembles and bands throughout the European Alps and should not be confused with &quot;Volkstümliche Musik&quot;, which is largely to be found in broadcasting media and on ancillary merchandise. Since the 1970s, artists of a &quot;Neue Volksmusik&quot; genre, such as Werner Pirchner or Biermösl Blosn, attempt to combine traditional styles with jazz, folk, electronic music, rock et al. as a kind of world music. Popular proponents include Hubert von Goisern, Attwenger and Christine Lauterburg.

<text>A  () is a short arming sword, used in early modern Europe notable for its sturdy build and a distinctive s-shaped or figure-8 shaped guard. Measuring long and weighing , it was the signature blade of the &quot;Landsknecht&quot;.

==Overview==
The is a side-arm, often used by pikemen, archers, and crossbowmen as a last resort if the enemy were to draw too close for bows or pikes to be effective.

Mostly a cutting sword, the rounded tips on many examples are ill-suited to thrusting, while the flat, broad blades are specialized for cutting. As with other similar cutting-centric arming swords, it can still be used for thrusting, though it is only likely to do damage to unarmored targets.

As with many sword varieties, variations exist within the type and katzbalger-style hilts can be found paired with slimmer and more thrust-oriented blades.

The large, characteristic guard helps to block and parry other cutting attacks. However, its openings leave the hands vulnerable to thrusting attacks.

==Terminology==
There are several different explanations about the origin of the name : one is that it comes from the custom of carrying a sword without a scabbard, held only by a cat&#x27;s skin (German word &#x27; means &quot;cat&quot;, while &#x27; means the skin (fur) of an animal. 

Another theory is that the word derives from &quot;&quot; (brawling), and refers to intense, close-quarter combat like fights between feral cats. The most common translation is &quot;cat-gutter&quot;, with an allusion to cat fight.

<text>In linear algebra, a minor of a matrix is the determinant of some smaller square matrix generated from by removing one or more of its rows and columns. Minors obtained by removing just one row and one column from square matrices (first minors) are required for calculating matrix cofactors, which are useful for computing both the determinant and inverse of square matrices. The requirement that the square matrix be smaller than the original matrix is often omitted in the definition.

==Definition and illustration==

===First minors===

If is a square matrix, then the &quot;minor&quot; of the entry in the -th row and -th column (also called the &quot;minor&quot;, or a &quot;first minor&quot;) is the determinant of the submatrix formed by deleting the -th row and -th column. This number is often denoted . The &quot;cofactor&quot; is obtained by multiplying the minor by .

To illustrate these definitions, consider the following matrix,

formula_1

To compute the minor and the cofactor , we find the determinant of the above matrix with row 2 and column 3 removed.

formula_2

So the cofactor of the entry is

formula_3

===General definition===

Let be an matrix and an integer with , and . A &quot;minor&quot; of , also called &quot;minor determinant of order &quot; of or, if , the &quot;th&quot; &quot;minor determinant&quot; of (the word &quot;determinant&quot; is often omitted, and the word &quot;degree&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;order&quot;) is the determinant of a matrix obtained from by deleting rows and columns. Sometimes the term is used to refer to the matrix obtained from as above (by deleting rows and columns), but this matrix should be referred to as a &quot;(square) submatrix&quot; of , leaving the term &quot;minor&quot; to refer to the determinant of this matrix. For a matrix as above, there are a total of formula_4 minors of size . The &quot;minor of order zero&quot; is often defined to be 1. For a square matrix, the &quot;zeroth minor&quot; is just the determinant of the matrix.

Let 
formula_5
be ordered sequences (in natural order, as it is always assumed when talking about minors unless otherwise stated) of indexes. The minor formula_6 corresponding to these choices of indexes is denoted formula_7 or formula_8 or formula_9 or formula_10 or formula_11 or formula_12 (where the denotes the sequence of indexes , etc.), depending on the source. Also, there are two types of denotations in use in literature: by the minor associated to ordered sequences of indexes and , some authors mean the determinant of the matrix that is formed as above, by taking the elements of the original matrix from the rows whose indexes are in and columns whose indexes are in , whereas some other authors mean by a minor associated to and the determinant of the matrix formed from the original matrix by deleting the rows in and columns in ; which notation is used should always be checked. In this article, we use the inclusive definition of choosing the elements from rows of and columns of . The exceptional case is the case of the first minor or the -minor described above; in that case, the exclusive meaning formula_13 is standard everywhere in the literature and is used in this article also.

===Complement===

The complement of a minor of a square matrix, , is formed by the determinant of the matrix from which all the rows () and columns () associated with have been removed. The complement of the first minor of an element is merely that element.

==Applications of minors and cofactors==

===Cofactor expansion of the determinant===
The cofactors feature prominently in Laplace&#x27;s formula for the expansion of determinants, which is a method of computing larger determinants in terms of smaller ones. Given an matrix , the determinant of , denoted , can be written as the sum of the cofactors of any row or column of the matrix multiplied by the entries that generated them. In other words, defining formula_14 then the cofactor expansion along the -th column gives:

formula_15

The cofactor expansion along the -th row gives:

formula_16

===Inverse of a matrix===
One can write down the inverse of an invertible matrix by computing its cofactors by using Cramer&#x27;s rule, as follows. The matrix formed by all of the cofactors of a square matrix is called the cofactor matrix (also called the matrix of cofactors or, sometimes, &quot;comatrix&quot;):

formula_17

Then the inverse of is the transpose of the cofactor matrix times the reciprocal of the determinant of :

formula_18

The transpose of the cofactor matrix is called the adjugate matrix (also called the &quot;classical adjoint&quot;) of .

The above formula can be generalized as follows: Let 
formula_19
be ordered sequences (in natural order) of indexes (here is an matrix). Then

formula_20

where denote the ordered sequences of indices (the indices are in natural order of magnitude, as above) complementary to , so that every index appears exactly once in either or , but not in both (similarly for the and ) and denotes the determinant of the submatrix of formed by choosing the rows of the index set and columns of index set . Also, formula_21 A simple proof can be given using wedge product. Indeed,

formula_22

where formula_23 are the basis vectors. Acting by on both sides, one gets

formula_24

The sign can be worked out to be 
formula_25
so the sign is determined by the sums of elements in and .

===Other applications===
Given an matrix with real entries (or entries from any other field) and rank , then there exists at least one non-zero minor, while all larger minors are zero.

We will use the following notation for minors: if is an matrix, is a subset of with elements, and is a subset of with elements, then we write for the minor of that corresponds to the rows with index in and the columns with index in .
* If , then is called a &quot;principal minor&quot;.
* If the matrix that corresponds to a principal minor is a square upper-left submatrix of the larger matrix (i.e., it consists of matrix elements in rows and columns from 1 to , also known as a leading principal submatrix), then the principal minor is called a &quot;leading principal minor (of order )&quot; or &quot;corner (principal) minor (of order )&quot;. For an square matrix, there are leading principal minors.
* A &quot;basic minor&quot; of a matrix is the determinant of a square submatrix that is of maximal size with nonzero determinant.
* For Hermitian matrices, the leading principal minors can be used to test for positive definiteness and the principal minors can be used to test for positive semidefiniteness. See Sylvester&#x27;s criterion for more details.

Both the formula for ordinary matrix multiplication and the Cauchy–Binet formula for the determinant of the product of two matrices are special cases of the following general statement about the minors of a product of two matrices.
Suppose that is an matrix, is an matrix, is a subset of with elements and is a subset of with elements. Then
formula_26
where the sum extends over all subsets of with elements. This formula is a straightforward extension of the Cauchy–Binet formula.

==Multilinear algebra approach==

A more systematic, algebraic treatment of minors is given in multilinear algebra, using the wedge product: the -minors of a matrix are the entries in the -th exterior power map.

If the columns of a matrix are wedged together at a time, the minors appear as the components of the resulting -vectors. For example, the 2 × 2 minors of the matrix
formula_27
are −13 (from the first two rows), −7 (from the first and last row), and 5 (from the last two rows). Now consider the wedge product
formula_28
where the two expressions correspond to the two columns of our matrix. Using the properties of the wedge product, namely that it is bilinear and alternating,
formula_29
and antisymmetric,
formula_30
we can simplify this expression to
formula_31
where the coefficients agree with the minors computed earlier.

==A remark about different notation==
In some books, instead of &quot;cofactor&quot; the term &quot;adjunct&quot; is used. Moreover, it is denoted as and defined in the same way as cofactor:
formula_32

Using this notation the inverse matrix is written this way:
formula_33

Keep in mind that &quot;adjunct&quot; is not adjugate or adjoint. In modern terminology, the &quot;adjoint&quot; of a matrix most often refers to the corresponding adjoint operator.

<doc id="262108" wikidata="Q11122366" url="?curid=262108" title="Sandalwood">
<text>Sandalwood is a class of woods from trees in the genus &quot;Santalum&quot;. The woods are heavy, yellow, and fine-grained, and, unlike many other aromatic woods, they retain their fragrance for decades. Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods. Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world. Both the wood and the oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for centuries. Consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have suffered over-harvesting in the past.

==Nomenclature==
The nomenclature and the taxonomy of the genus are derived from this species&#x27; historical and widespread use. Etymologically it is ultimately derived from Sanskrit चन्दन &quot;Chandana&quot; (&quot;čandana&quot;), meaning &quot;wood for burning incense&quot; and related to &quot;candrah&quot;, &quot;shining, glowing&quot; and the Latin &quot;candere&quot;, to shine or glow. It arrived in English via Late Greek, Medieval Latin and Old French in the 14th or 15th century.

==True sandalwoods==

Sandalwoods are medium-sized hemiparasitic trees, and part of the same botanical family as European mistletoe. Sandalwood is indigenous to the tropical belt of the peninsular India, Malay Archipelago and northern Australia. The main distribution is in the drier tropical regions of India and the Indonesian islands of Timor and Sumba. It spread to other regions through the incense trade route by the vast Indian and Arab mercantile networks and the Chinese maritime trade routes until the sixteenth century CE. The sandalwood of peninsular India and the Malay Archipelago supported most consumption in East Asia and West Asia during the time of the incense trade route before the commercialization of Australian sandalwood (&quot;Santalum spicatum&quot;) in sandalwood plantations in Australia and China, although sandalwood album (&quot;Santalum album&quot;) is still considered to have the best and original quality in terms of religion and alternative medicine. &quot;Santalum spicatum&quot; is marketed as the notable members of this group today by merchants because of its stable sources; others in the genus also have fragrant wood. These are found in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, Indonesia, Hawaii, and other Pacific Islands, 
* &quot;S. album&quot; is a threatened species native to dry tropical regions of Indonesia (Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands), the Philippines, and Western Australia. It was one of the plants exploited by Austronesian arboriculture and it was introduced by Austronesian sailors to East Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia during the ancient spice trade, becoming naturalized in South India by at least 1300 BCE. In India, the principal sandal tracts are most parts of Karnataka and adjoining districts of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. Although sandalwood trees in India, Pakistan, and Nepal are government-owned and their harvest is controlled, many trees are illegally cut down. Sandalwood oil prices had risen to $3000 per liter by 2017.
* &quot;S. ellipticum&quot;, &quot;S. freycinetianum&quot;, and &quot;S. paniculatum&quot;, the Hawaiian sandalwood (&quot;iliahi&quot;), were also used and considered high quality. These three species were exploited between 1790 and 1825 before the supply of trees ran out (a fourth species, &quot;S. haleakalae&quot;, occurs only in subalpine areas and was never exported). Although &quot;S. freycinetianum&quot; and &quot;S. paniculatum&quot; are relatively common today, they have not regained their former abundance or size, and &quot;S. ellipticum&quot; remains rare.
* &quot;S. yasi&quot;, a sandalwood from Fiji and Tonga.
* &quot;S. spicatum&quot; is used by aromatherapists and perfumers. The oil concentration differs considerably from other &quot;Santalum&quot; species. In the 1840s, sandalwood was Western Australia&#x27;s biggest export earner. Oil was distilled for the first time in 1875, and by the turn of the 20th century, production of Australian sandalwood oil was intermittent. However, in the late 1990s, Western Australian sandalwood oil enjoyed a revival and by 2009 had peaked at more than per year – much of which went to the fragrance industries in Europe. Although overall production has decreased, by 2011, a significant percentage of its production was heading to the chewing tobacco industry in India alongside Indian sandalwood – the chewing tobacco market being the largest market for both oils in 2012.
* Other species: Commercially, various other species, not belonging to &quot;Santalum&quot; species, are also used as sandalwood.
===Unrelated plants===
Various unrelated plants with scented wood and also referred to as sandalwood, but not in the true sandalwood genus:
*&quot;Adenanthera pavonina&quot; – sandalwood tree, red or false red sandalwood
*&quot;Baphia nitida&quot; – camwood, also known as African sandalwood
*&quot;Eremophila mitchellii&quot; – sandalwood; false sandalwood (also sandalbox)
*&quot;Myoporum platycarpum&quot; – sandalwood; false sandalwood
*&quot;Myoporum sandwicense&quot; – bastard sandalwood, false sandalwood
*&quot;Osyris lanceolata&quot; – African sandalwood
*&quot;Osyris tenuifolia&quot; – east African sandalwood
*&quot;Pterocarpus santalinus&quot; – false red sandalwood growing in southern Indian regions

==Production==

Producing commercially valuable sandalwood with high levels of fragrance oils requires Indian sandalwood (&quot;S. album&quot;) trees to be a minimum of 15 years old – the yield, quality and volume are still to be clearly understood. Yield of oil tends to vary depending on the age and location of the tree; usually, the older trees yield the highest oil content and quality. India continues to produce a superior quality of Santalum Album, with FP Aromatics being the largest exporter. Australia is the largest producer of &quot;S. album&quot;, with the majority grown around Kununurra, in the far north of the state by Quintis (formerly Tropical Forestry Services), which in 2017 controlled around 80% of the world&#x27;s supply of Indian sandalwood, and Santanol. India used to be the world&#x27;s biggest producer, but it has been overtaken by Australia in the 21st century. Over-exploitation is partly to blame for the decline. However, ethical plantations in India are on the rise, and India is expected to increase its supply manyfold by 2030, owing to favourable weather conditions and competitive pricing.

Australian sandalwood (&quot;S. spicatum&quot;) is grown in commercial plantations throughout the wheatbelt of Western Australia, where it has been an important part of the economy since colonial times. WA has the largest plantation resource in the world.

Sandalwood is expensive compared to other types of woods. To maximize profit, sandalwood is harvested by removing the entire tree instead of felling at the trunk near ground level. This way wood from the stump and root, which possesses high levels of sandalwood oil, can also be processed and sold.

Australian sandalwood is mostly harvested and sold in log form, graded for heartwood content. The species is unique in that the white sapwood does not require removal before distilling the oil. The logs are either processed to distill the essential oil, or made into powders for making incense. Indian sandalwood, used mainly for oil extraction, does require removal of the sapwood prior to distillation. , Australian Sandalwood oil sells for around per , while Indian Sandalwood oil, due to its higher alpha santalol content, is priced at about per kg.

Sandalwood is often cited as one of the most expensive woods in the world, along with African blackwood, pink ivory, agarwood and ebony.

Sandalwood has historically been an important tree in the development of the political economy of the Pacific. Prior to colonization in the region, the sandalwood tree was a marker of status, rank and beauty. It then became an important part of the Pacific trade during the colonial period, as it was one of the few resources the West was able to successfully trade with Chinese merchants. This western trade began to put pressure on the production of sandalwood in the region.

Tonga, a Polynesian kingdom in the Oceania region, saw a severe depletion of its sandalwood tree (locally known as “‘ahi”) due a disruption of the social hierarchy, known as “fahu”, which led to heightened local competition and eventually an over harvest. Nearly all of the sandalwood resources were depleted over the span of two years.
Tongan people have a unique social dynamic referred to as “fahu.” On the one hand, the kinship system of fahu is able to ensure biodiversity and sustainability in contemporary Tonga. But on the other hand, a principal factor in the over harvest of the ‘ahi tree was the result of the defensive actions of farmers defying fahu customs. As sandalwood became valuable in the market, lower-ranking family members began to harvest the trees without permission, encouraging many farmers to harvest their trees defensively and thus leading to over harvest. 

In 2007, Mike Evans published a scholarly report on Tongan sandalwood overharvest and the socio-environmental implications of resource commodification and privatized land tenure. Evan’s concluded that “whatever the short-term ecological benefits of enforcing privatized land tenure, because private property not only fragments social ties by allowing an individual to deny others, it has the potential to fragment the regional ecology as well.”

== Uses ==

===Fragrance===

Sandalwood oil has a distinctive soft, warm, smooth, creamy, and milky precious-wood scent. Its quality and scent profile is greatly influenced by the age of the tree, location and the skill of the distiller. It imparts a long-lasting, woody base to perfumes from the oriental, woody, &quot;fougère&quot;, and &quot;chypre&quot; families, as well as a fixative to floral and citrus fragrances. When used in smaller proportions in a perfume, it acts as a fixative, enhancing the longevity of other, more volatile, materials in the composite. Sandalwood is also a key ingredient in the &quot;floriental&quot; (floral-ambery) fragrance family – when combined with white florals such as jasmine, ylang ylang, gardenia, plumeria, orange blossom, tuberose, lily of the valley, etc. Its also acts as a versatile base that blends well with other woody scents like patchouli and cedar.

Sandalwood oil in India is widely used in the cosmetic industry. The main source of true sandalwood, &quot;S. album&quot;, is a protected species, and demand for it cannot be met. Many species of plants are traded as &quot;sandalwood&quot;. The genus &quot;Santalum&quot; has more than 19 species. Traders often accept oil from closely related species, as well as from unrelated plants such as West Indian sandalwood (&quot;Amyris balsamifera&quot;) in the family Rutaceae or bastard sandalwood (&quot;Myoporum sandwicense&quot;, Myoporaceae). However, most woods from these alternative sources lose their aroma within a few months or years.

Isobornyl cyclohexanol is a synthetic fragrance chemical produced as an alternative to the natural product.

Sandalwood&#x27;s main components are the two isomers of santalol (about 75%). It is used in aromatherapy, in scented candles and to prepare soaps.

=== Idols/sculptures ===

Sandalwood lends itself well to carving and has thus, traditionally, been a wood of choice for statues and sculptures of Hindu gods.

=== Technology ===
Due to its low fluorescence and optimal refractive index, sandalwood oil is often employed as an immersion oil within ultraviolet and fluorescence microscopy.

=== Food ===
Aboriginal Australians eat the seed kernels, nuts, and fruit of local sandalwoods, such as the quandong (&quot;S. acuminatum&quot;).
Early Europeans in Australia used quandong in cooking damper by infusing it with its leaves, and in making jams, pies, and chutneys from the fruit. In Scandinavia, pulverised bark from red sandalwood (&quot;Pterocarpus soyauxii&quot;) is used—with other tropical spices—when marinating anchovies and some types of pickled herring such as &quot;matjes&quot;, sprat, and certain types of traditional &quot;spegesild&quot;, inducing a reddish colour and slightly perfumed flavour.

Present-day chefs have begun experimenting in using the nut as a substitute for macadamia nuts or a bush food substitute for almonds, hazelnuts, and others in Southeast Asian-styled cuisine. The oil is also used as a flavour component in different food items, including candy, ice cream, baked food, puddings, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and gelatin. The flavouring is used at levels below 10 ppm, the highest possible level for use in food products being 90 ppm.

== Distillation ==

Oil is extracted from Sandalwood through distillation. Many different methods are used, including steam distillation, water distillation, CO2 extraction, and solvent extractions. Steam distillation is the most common method used by sandalwood companies. It occurs in a four-step process, incorporating boiling, steaming, condensation, and separation. Water is heated to high temperatures () and is then passed through the wood. The oil is very tightly bound within the cellular structure of the wood, but can be released by the high heat of the steam. The mixture of steam and oil is then cooled and separated so that the essential oil can be collected. This process is much longer than any other essential oil&#x27;s distillation, taking 14 to 36 hours to complete, but generally produces much higher quality oil. Water, or hydro, distillation is the more traditional method of sandalwood extraction which involves soaking the wood in water and then boiling it until the oil is released. This method is not used as much anymore because of the high costs and time associated with heating large quantities of water.

== Religion ==
===Hinduism===
Sandalwood is considered sacred in the Hindu Ayurveda and is known in Sanskrit as &quot;chandana.&quot; The wood is used for worshipping the deities, and it is said that Lakshmi (Sri), the goddess of well-being, lives in the sandalwood tree; therefore, it is also known as &quot;Srigandha&quot;. 

Sandalwood paste is prepared by grinding a piece of dry sandalwood into powder, against a stone slab. With the gradual addition of water, a thick paste forms, (called &quot;kalabham&quot; &quot;കളഭം&quot; in Malayalam language and &quot;gandha&quot; ಗಂಧ in Kannada) and it is mixed with saffron or other such pigments to make &quot;chandanam&quot;. &quot;Chandanam&quot;, further mixed with herbs, perfumes, pigments, and some other compounds, results in &quot;javadhu&quot;. &quot;Kalabham, chandanam,&quot; and &quot;javadhu&quot; are dried and used as &quot;kalabham&quot; powder, &quot;chandanam&quot; powder, and &quot;javadhu&quot; powder, respectively. &quot;Chandanam&quot; powder is very popular in India and is also used in Nepal. 

In Tirupati, after religious tonsure, sandalwood paste is applied to protect the skin. In Hinduism and Ayurveda, sandalwood is thought to bring one closer to the divine. Thus, it is one of the most used holy elements in Hindu and Vedic societies.
This paste is integral to rituals and ceremonies, for making religious utensils, for decorating sacred images, and it is believed to calm the mind during meditation and prayer. It is also distributed to devotees, who apply it to their foreheads or necks and chests. Sandalwood paste is used for most pujas both in temples and private households.

===Jainism===
Sandalwood use is an integral part of the daily practices of Jainism. Sandalwood paste mixed with saffron is used to worship the Tirthankaras of Jainism. Sandalwood powder is showered as blessings by Jain monks and nuns (&quot;sadhus&quot; and &quot;sadhvis&quot;) onto their disciples and followers. Sandalwood garlands are used to dress the body during Jain cremation ceremonies. During the festival of Mahamastakabhisheka that is held once in every 12 years, the Gommateshwara statue is bathed and anointed with libations such as milk, sugarcane juice, and saffron paste, and sprinkled with powders of sandalwood, turmeric, and vermilion.

===Buddhism===
Sandalwood is mentioned in various &quot;suttas&quot; of the Pāli Canon. In some Buddhist traditions, sandalwood is considered to be of the &quot;padma&quot; (lotus) group and attributed to Amitabha Buddha. Sandalwood scent is believed by some to transform one&#x27;s desires and maintain a person&#x27;s alertness while in meditation. It is also one of the most popular scents used when offering incense to the Buddha and the guru.

===Sufism===
In the Indian variants of &quot;Sufism&quot;, sandalwood paste is applied on a revered Sufi&#x27;s grave by the disciples as a mark of devotion. The tradition is practiced particularly by devotees in the Indian Subcontinent. In Tamil culture, irrespective of one&#x27;s religious identity, sandalwood paste or powder is applied to the graves of Sufi saints as a mark of devotion and respect.

===East Asian religions===
In East Asia, sandalwood (檀木), is the most commonly used incense material by the Chinese, Korean and Japanese in worship and various ceremonies. Some Taoist sects, following the Ming Dynasty Taoist Manual, avoid the use of sandalwood (as well as benzoin resin and frankincense) as incense in worship. In Korean Shamanism, sandalwood is considered the Tree of Life. It was transmitted to China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan during the eastward expansion of Buddhism.

===Zoroastrianism===
Zoroastrians offer sandalwood twigs to the &quot;afarganyu,&quot; the urn in which the fire is kept at the fire temple (called &quot;agiyari&quot; in Gujarati and &quot;dar-e mehr&quot; in Persian), to keep the fire burning during religious ceremonies. After the firekeeping priests complete the ceremony, attendees are allowed to come up to the &quot;afarganyu&quot; and place their own pieces of sandalwood into the fire. Fire has been a sacred symbol in the Zoroastrian religion since ancient times and it is considered very important to keep the fires in the temples constantly burning. Because of its high sensitivity to fire, sandalwood works very well for this. Also, the wood has been accepted by the Yasna and Yashts (sacred texts) as an appropriate fuel for the fire. It is offered to all of the three grades of fire in the fire temple, including the Atash Dadgahs. Sandalwood is not offered to the &quot;divo&quot;, a smaller lamp that is kept in the homes of Zoroastrians. Often, money is offered to the &quot;mobad&quot; (priest) as payment, along with sandalwood. Sandalwood is called &quot;sukhad&quot; in the Zoroastrian community. The sandalwood in the fire temple is often more expensive to buy than at a Zoroastrian store. It is often a source of income for the fire temple.

<text>Jojoba (; botanical name: &quot;Simmondsia chinensis&quot;)also commonly called goat nut, deer nut, pignut, wild hazel, quinine nut, coffeeberry, and gray box bushis an evergreen, dioecious shrub native to the Southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. &quot;Simmondsia chinensis&quot; is the sole species of the family Simmondsiaceae, placed in the order Caryophyllales.

Jojoba is grown commercially in its area of origin and in other (semi-)arid regions to produce jojoba oil, a liquid wax ester extracted from its seed.

==Distribution==
The plant is a native shrub of the Sonoran Desert, Colorado Desert, Baja California desert, and California chaparral and woodlands habitats in the Peninsular Ranges and San Jacinto Mountains. It is found in southern California, Arizona, and Utah (U.S.), and Baja California state (Mexico).

Jojoba is endemic to North America, and occupies an area of approximately between latitudes 25° and 31° North and between longitudes 109° and 117° West.

==Description==
&quot;Simmondsia chinensis&quot;, or jojoba, typically grows to tall, with a broad, dense crown, but there have been reports of plants as tall as .

The leaves are opposite, ovalish in shape, long and broad, thick, waxy, and glaucous gray-green in color. Jojoba is an evergreen, but it sometimes shed its leaves as a response to severe droughts.

The flowers are small and greenish-yellow, with 5–6 sepals and no petals. The plant typically blooms from March to May.
===Reproduction===
Each plant is dioecious, with hermaphrodites being extremely rare. In the wild, the sexes appear in the ratio of 5 males for 1 female. The fruit is an acorn-shaped ovoid, three-angled capsule long, partly enclosed at the base by the sepals. The mature seed is a hard oval that is dark brown and contains an oil (liquid wax) content of approximately 54%. An average-sized bush produces of pollen, to which few humans are allergic.

The female plants produce seed from flowers pollinated by the male plants. Jojoba leaves have an aerodynamic shape, creating a spiral effect, which brings wind-borne pollen from the male flower to the female flower.[?] Even though the male flowers are attractive for bees and are a pollen source, jojoba is anemophilous because its female flowers are not attractive to pollinators. In the Northern Hemisphere, pollination occurs during February and March. In the Southern Hemisphere, pollination occurs during August and September.[?]

=== Genetics ===
The jojoba genome was sequenced in 2020 and reported to be 887-Mb, consisting of 26 chromosomes and is predicted to have 23,490 protein-coding genes. Somatic cells of jojoba are tetraploid; the number of chromosomes is 2&quot;n&quot; = 4&quot;x&quot; = 52.

===Taxonomy===
Despite its scientific name &quot;Simmondsia chinensis&quot;, the plant is not native to China. The botanist Johann Link originally named the species &quot;Buxus chinensis&quot;, after misreading a collection label &quot;Calif&quot;, referring to California, as &quot;China&quot;. Jojoba was collected again in 1836 by Thomas Nuttall who described it as a new genus and species in 1844, naming it &quot;Simmondsia californica&quot;, but priority rules require that the original specific epithet be used.

The common name &quot;jojoba&quot; originated from the Oʼodham name &quot;Hohowi&quot;. The common name should not be confused with the similarly written jujube (&quot;Ziziphus zizyphus&quot;), an unrelated plant species, which is commonly grown in China.

== Production ==
The United States is the largest producer of jojoba oil, followed by Mexico. Due to its economic potential, the plant has been cultivated for over 30 years in several countries. Jojoba oil production has increased significantly and is expected to continue growing due to rising demand, particularly in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.

Jojoba has no significance in the global food system, as it is a non-edible plant with no notable nutritional value. Various cultivars such as &#x27;Benzioni&#x27; and &#x27;Hazerim&#x27; are available, known for their high yields.

==Uses==
Jojoba foliage provides year-round food for many animals, including deer, javelina, bighorn sheep, and livestock. Its seeds are eaten by squirrels, rabbits, other rodents, and larger birds.

Only Bailey&#x27;s pocket mouse, however, is known to be able to digest the wax found inside the jojoba seed. In large quantities, jojoba seed meal is toxic to many mammals. Later this effect was found to be due to simmondsin, which inhibits hunger. The indigestible wax acts as a laxative in humans.

Jojoba oil is highly valued in the cosmetics industry due to its similarity to human sebum. Consistent use of jojoba oil is thought to help regulate the skin’s oil production. Additionally, it has a longer shelf life than other natural oils, making it a durable ingredient in skincare products. Medically, jojoba oil can relieve headaches, throat inflammation, and treat wounds. It has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal properties. After oil extraction, the leftover jojoba meal can be used as a low-cost livestock feed. Jojoba leaves also contain antioxidant flavonoids, which have been studied for their potential in treating asthma, inflammation, and cancer.

===Native American uses===
Native Americans first made use of jojoba. During the early 18th century Jesuit missionaries on the Baja California Peninsula observed indigenous peoples heating jojoba seeds to soften them. They then used a mortar and pestle to create a salve or buttery substance. The latter was applied to the skin and hair to heal and condition. The O&#x27;odham people of the Sonoran Desert treated burns with an antioxidant salve made from a paste of the jojoba seed.

Native Americans also used the salve to soften and preserve animal hides. Pregnant women ate jojoba seeds, believing they assisted during childbirth. Hunters and raiders ate jojoba on the trail to keep hunger at bay.

The Seri, who utilize nearly every edible plant in their domain, do not regard the seeds as real food and in the past ate it only in emergencies.

===Introduction to Europe===
Archibald Menzies was the botanist with the Vancouver Expedition that arrived in Santa Barbara, California in November 1793. He was given fruit and plants of the jojoba by padre of the San Diego Mission. These survived the voyage back to the UK and were planted in the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew near London.

===Contemporary uses===
Jojoba is grown for the liquid wax, commonly called jojoba oil, in its seeds. The oil is rare in that it is an extremely long (C36–C46) straight-chain wax ester and not a triglyceride, making jojoba and its derivative jojoba esters more similar to whale oil than to traditional vegetable oils. Jojoba oil has also been discussed as a possible biodiesel fuel, but it cannot be cultivated on a scale to compete with traditional fossil fuels, so its use is restricted to personal care products.

=== Cultivation ===
Plantations of jojoba have been established in a number of desert and semi-desert areas, predominantly in Argentina, Australia, Israel, Mexico, Peru and the United States. It is currently the Sonoran Desert&#x27;s second most economically valuable native plant (overshadowed only by &quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;—California fan palms, used as ornamental trees).

Jojoba prefers light, coarsely textured soils. Good drainage and water penetration is necessary. It tolerates salinity and nutrient-poor soils. Soil pH should be between 5 and 8. Jojoba grows best in young, coarse soils with minimal profile development. These soils, primarily derived from acid igneous materials, are typically found on slopes exceeding 3 up to over 30 percent. On north-facing slopes is the moisture retention often better and can thus be preferred of the jojoba especially for the youth development. 

High temperatures are tolerated by jojoba, but frost can damage or kill plants. Jojoba can endure extreme temperature, with summer temperatures up to 46 °C. However, they can on the other hand experience leaf damage in cold conditions. The seedlings are more vulnerable, suffering damage or death at temperatures between three to nine degrees below freezing. Factors such as drought, freezing conditions, and biotic pressures can significantly impact seedling survival.
Jojoba thrives at various elevations, ranging from sea level to lower mountain slopes. In Arizona&#x27;s Sonoran Desert, it is commonly found between 600 and 1300 m. This elevation range provides an ideal environment for jojoba, characterized by well-drained, dry slopes or along wadis, where water runoff can support plant growth. 

Requirements are minimal, so jojoba plants do not need intensive cultivation. Weed problems only occur during the first two years after planting and there is little damage by insects. 

Jojoba is well-suited for areas with low annual precipitation, typically flourishing where it exceeds 355mm annually. But it is possible to grow and survive for jojoba with a precipitation below 100mm. The optimal range for precipitation is between 450 and 500mm, which provides the necessary moisture for growth. But during the seed development a sufficient water availability is necessary. Supplemental irrigation could maximize production where rainfall is less than 400 mm. There is no need for high fertilisation, but, especially in the first year, nitrogen increases growth. Jojoba is normally harvested by hand because seeds do not all mature in the same time. Yield is around 3.5 t/ha depending on the age of the plantation.

Selective breeding is developing plants that produce more beans with higher wax content, as well as other characteristics that will facilitate harvesting.

By selecting appropriate elevations and ensuring proper water management, farmers can establish successful jojoba plantations that yield high-quality oil. As interest in sustainable agriculture grows, jojoba represents a promising crop for arid regions, providing economic benefits while thriving in challenging environments.
Its ability to withstand high salinity up to 12 ds [m−1 at pH 9) (deciSiemens or ECe  Salt tolerance of crops) and the high value of jojoba products make jojoba an interesting plant for the use of desertification control. It has been used to combat and prevent desertification in the Thar Desert in India.

Research continues on options to further increase yields. There are already findings on the types of pruning techniques for the bushes, which are expected to make a difference in yields.

== Processing technology ==
Jojoba oil is traditionally extracted by mechanically pressing the seeds, often with the use of hexane to maximize yield, resulting in a typical oil extraction of 35–43%. Other methods using organic solvents like chloroform or isopropanol can increase the yield to up to 55%.

A more environmentally friendly, but more expensive, method is supercritical CO2 extraction. This method can be enhanced by adding co-solvents such as ethanol.

Transesterification is used to convert jojoba oil into biodiesel, where the oil reacts with alcohol (e.g., methanol) in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., sodium hydroxide). Both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts can be used, as well as enzymatic catalysts, which are more environmentally friendly but costlier.

== Molecular breeding ==

Jojoba is a dioecious plant, which brings one of its main challenges. Only the female bushes bear seeds that can be used for jojoba oil production. The sex of the plant is only visible to the eye after flowering (3-4 years after planting). A proportion of 10% male plants is required in a field for efficient production. About 50% of the plants grown from seed are male. This genetic heterogeneity makes commercial cultivation questionable. Therefore, vegetative propagation is preferred to ensure homogeneous and high-yielding genotypes. To differentiate between male and female plants, several Molecular marker have been developed.

Agrawal et al. (2007) identified the sex-specific Random amplification of polymorphic DNA Genetic marker OPG-5, a base segment of 1400 bp, which only occurs in male plants. Agarwal et al. (2011) found additional markers at approximately 525 bp and 325 bp, specific to male plants, using the Amplified fragment length polymorphism method and the primers EcoRI-GC/MseI-GCG and EcoRI-TAC/MseI-GCG. Additionally, a female-specific marker was found at approximately 270 bp with the primers EcoRI-TAC/MseI-GCG. Gender-specific Microsatellite markers were also discovered.

Over the past two decades, a number of Genetic marker have been developed that help determine the sex of the plant, thereby reducing the risk for farmers by ensuring more accurate propagation of female plants.

<text>Simmondsiaceae or the jojoba family is a family of flowering plants. The family is not recognized by all taxonomic systems, the single species, &quot;Simmondsia chinensis&quot;, often being treated as belonging to family Buxaceae.

The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), does recognize this family and assigns it to the order Caryophyllales in the clade core eudicots. It consist of a single species only, jojoba (&quot;Simmondsia chinensis&quot;), of North American shrubs.

The Cronquist system, 1981, had also recognized this family and placed it in order Euphorbiales.

<doc id="262120" wikidata="Q155008" url="?curid=262120" title="Operation Uranus">
<text>Operation Uranus () was a Soviet 19–23 November 1942 strategic operation on the Eastern Front of World War II which led to the encirclement of Axis forces in the vicinity of Stalingrad: the German Sixth Army, the Third and Fourth Romanian armies, and portions of the German Fourth Panzer Army. The Red Army carried out the operation at roughly the midpoint of the five-month long Battle of Stalingrad, aiming to destroy German forces in and around Stalingrad. Planning for Operation Uranus had commenced in September 1942, and developed simultaneously with plans to envelop and destroy German Army Group Center (Operation Mars) and German forces in the Caucasus.

Due to the length of the front lines created by the German 1942 summer offensive, which had aimed at taking the Caucasus oil fields and the city of Stalingrad, German and other Axis forces were over-extended. The German decision to transfer several mechanized divisions from the Soviet Union to Western Europe exacerbated their situation. Furthermore, Axis units in the area were depleted by months of fighting, especially those which had taken part in the struggle for Stalingrad. The Germans could only count on the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, which had the strength of a single panzer division, and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division as reserves to bolster their Romanian allies guarding the German Sixth Army&#x27;s flanks. These Romanian armies lacked the heavy equipment to deal with Soviet armor. In contrast, the Red Army deployed over one million personnel for the offensive. Soviet troop movements were not without problems: concealing their build-up proved difficult, and Soviet units commonly arrived late due to logistical issues. Operation Uranus was first postponed by the Soviet high command (&quot;Stavka&quot;) from 8 to 17 November, then to 19 November.

At 07:20 Moscow time on 19 November, Soviet forces assaulted the northern flank of the Axis forces at Stalingrad; attacks in the south began the next day. Although the Romanian units succeeded in repelling the first Soviet attacks, by the end of 20 November the Third and Fourth Romanian armies were in headlong retreat, as the Red Army bypassed several German infantry divisions. German mobile reserves proved too weak to parry the Soviet mechanized spearheads, while the Sixth Army did not react quickly or decisively enough to disengage German armored forces in Stalingrad and re-orient them to countering the impending threat. By late 22 November, the northern and southern Soviet forces linked up at the town of Kalach, encircling some 290,000 Axis personnel east of the Don River. Instead of attempting to break out of the encirclement, German leader Adolf Hitler decided to keep Axis forces in Stalingrad and to resupply them by air.

==Background==
On 28 June 1942, the Wehrmacht began its offensive against Soviet forces opposite of Army Group South, codenamed Case Blue. After breaking through Red Army forces by 13 July, German forces encircled and captured the city of Rostov. Following the fall of Rostov, Hitler split German forces operating in the southern extremity of the southern Russian SFSR in an effort to simultaneously capture the city of Stalingrad and the Caucasus oil fields. The responsibility to take Stalingrad was given to the Sixth Army, which immediately turned towards the Volga River and began its advance with heavy air support from the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot;. On 7 August, two German panzer corps were able to flank and encircle a Soviet force of 50,000 personnel and approximately 1,000 tanks, and on 22 August German forces began to cross the Don River to complete the advance towards the Volga. The following day, the Battle of Stalingrad began when vanguards of the Sixth Army penetrated the suburbs of the city.

By November the Sixth Army had occupied most of Stalingrad, pushing the defending Red Army to the banks of the Volga River. By this stage, there were indications of an impending Soviet offensive which would target Wehrmacht forces around the city, including increased Soviet activity opposite the Sixth Army&#x27;s flanks, and information gained through the interrogation of Soviet prisoners. The German command remained focused upon finalizing its capture of Stalingrad and were unsure of where or when the counterattack would take place. Actions were taken to provide a reserve behind the Italian and Romanian armies, with 6th Panzer Division and two additional infantry divisions ordered to Russia from France. However, this move would only be completed by December. Head of Army General Staff General Franz Halder had been dismissed in September after his efforts to warn about the danger which was developing along the over-extended flanks of the Sixth Army and the Fourth Panzer Army. As early as September the Soviet &quot;Stavka&quot; (high command) began planning a series of counteroffensives to encompass the destruction of German forces in the south, fighting in Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, and against Army Group Center. Ultimately, command of Soviet efforts to relieve Stalingrad was put under the leadership of General Aleksandr Vasilevsky.

The &quot;Stavka&quot; developed two major operations to be conducted against Axis forces near Stalingrad, &quot;Uranus&quot; and &quot;Saturn&quot;, and also planned for Operation Mars, designed to engage German Army Group Center in an effort to distract reinforcements and to inflict as much damage as possible. Operation Uranus involved the use of large Soviet mechanized and infantry forces to encircle German and other Axis forces directly around Stalingrad. As preparations for the offensive commenced, the attack&#x27;s starting points were positioned on stretches of front to the rear of the German Sixth Army, largely preventing the Germans from reinforcing those sectors quickly where Axis units were too overstretched to occupy effectively. The offensive was a double envelopment; Soviet mechanized forces would penetrate deep into the German rear, while another attack would be made closer to the German Sixth Army in an effort to attack German units there directly in the rear. While the Red Army prepared, the German high commanders—influenced by their belief that the Red Army, building up opposite German Army Group Center to the north, was incapable of mounting a simultaneous offensive in the south—continued to deny the possibility of an impending Soviet offensive.

==Comparison of forces==
===Axis===
Case Blue involved German and other Axis forces sprawled out across a front over wide and several hundred kilometers deep, while the decision to conquer Stalingrad had stretched Axis forces even more thinly by drawing away personnel eastwards. For example, in early July, the Sixth Army was defending a line, while also committing to an offensive which involved a distance of around . Army Group B, which was split from Army Group South (the forces operating around the Caucasus were named Army Group A), seemed strong on paper: it included the Second and Sixth German, Fourth Panzer, Fourth and Third Romanian, Eighth Italian, and Second Hungarian Armies. Army Group B had the 48th Panzer Corps, which had the strength of a weakened panzer division, and a single infantry division as reserves. For the most part the German flanks were held by arriving non-German Axis armies, while German forces were used to spearhead continued operations in Stalingrad and in the Caucasus.
While Adolf Hitler expressed confidence in the ability of non-German Axis units to protect German flanks, in reality these units relied on largely obsolete equipment and horse-drawn artillery, while in many cases the harsh treatment of enlisted personnel by officers caused poor morale. In regard to mechanization, the First Romanian Armored Division was equipped with around 100 Czech-built R-2 tanks, armed with a gun ineffective against the armor of Soviet T-34 tanks. Similarly, their PaK anti-tank guns were also antiquated and they were largely short of ammunition. Only after repeated requests did the Germans send the Romanian units PaK guns; six per division. These units were extended over very large sections of front; for example, the Third Romanian Army occupied a line long, while the Fourth Romanian Army protected a line no less than long. The Italians and Hungarians were positioned at the Don west of the Third Romanian Army.

Generally, German forces were in no better shape; they were weakened by months of fighting the Red Army, and, while &quot;Stavka&quot; raised new armies, the German high command attempted to maintain its existing mechanized units. Furthermore, during the course of the German offensive between May and November 1942, two motorized divisions, the elite Leibstandarte and the Großdeutschland, were redeployed from Army Group A to the West, to provide a mechanized reserve in case of an Allied landing in France. The Sixth Army had also suffered many casualties during the fighting in the city of Stalingrad proper. In some cases, such as that of the 22nd Panzer Division, their equipment was no better than that of the First Romanian Armored Division. German formations were also overextended along large stretches of front; the XI Army Corps, for example, had to defend a front around long.

===Soviet===
The Red Army allocated an estimated 1,100,000 personnel, 804 tanks, 13,400 artillery pieces and over 1,000 aircraft for the upcoming offensive. Across the Third Romanian Army, the Soviets placed the redeployed 5th Tank Army, as well as the 21st and 65th Armies, in order to penetrate and overrun the German flanks. The German southern flank was targeted by the Stalingrad Front&#x27;s 51st and 57th Armies, led by the 13th and 4th Mechanized Corps; these would punch through the Fourth Romanian Army, in order to link up with the 5th Tank Army near the town of Kalach. In total, the Soviets had amassed 11 armies and various independent tank brigades and corps.

Preparations for the offensive were, however, far from perfect; on 8 November, &quot;Stavka&quot; issued orders to postpone the launch date of the operation, because transportation delays had prevented many units from being able to move into place. In the meantime, units at the front went through a number of war games to practice repelling an enemy counterattack and exploiting a breakthrough with mechanized forces. These movements were masked through a deception campaign by the Soviets, including the decrease of radio traffic, camouflage, operational security, using couriers for communication instead of radio, and active deception, such as increasing troop movements around Moscow. Troops were ordered to build defensive fortifications, to offer false impressions to the Germans, while fake bridges were put up to divert attention from the real bridges being built across the Don River. The Red Army also stepped up attacks against Army Group Center and set up dummy formations to maintain the idea of a main offensive against German forces in the center.

The Soviet Stalingrad Front forces were subject to heavy bombardment, making mobilization more difficult. The 38 engineer battalions allocated to the front were responsible for ferrying ammunition, personnel and tanks across the Volga River while carrying out minor reconnaissance along sections of the front which were to be the breakthrough points of the impending offensive. In three weeks the Red Army transported around 111,000 soldiers, 420 tanks and 556 artillery pieces across the Volga.

On 17 November Vasilevsky was recalled to Moscow, where he was shown a letter written to Stalin by General Volsky, commander of the 4th Mechanized Corps, who urged calling off the offensive. Volsky believed the offensive as planned was doomed to failure due to the state of the forces earmarked for the operation; he suggested postponing the offensive and redesigning it entirely. Many Soviet soldiers had not been issued with winter garments, and many died of frostbite, &quot;due to the irresponsible attitude of commanders&quot;. Although Soviet intelligence made honest efforts to collect as much information as possible on the disposition of the Axis forces arrayed in front of them, there was not much information on the state of the German Sixth Army. Vasilevsky wanted to call off the offensive. The Soviet commanders, overruling Vasilevsky, agreed the offensive would not be called off, and Stalin personally rang Volsky, who reiterated his intention to carry out the operation if ordered to do so.

==Soviet offensive==

Operation Uranus, postponed until 17 November, was again postponed for two days when Soviet General Georgy Zhukov was told the air units allotted to the operation were not ready; it was finally launched on 19 November. Shortly after 5 a.m. Lieutenant Gerhard Stöck, posted with the Romanian IV Army Corps on the Kletskaya sector called Sixth Army headquarters housed in Golubinsky, offering intelligence on a pending attack which would occur after 05:00 that morning; however, because his call had come in after five and false alarms were common during this time, the duty officer on the other end of the line was not keen on waking the Army Chief of Staff, General Arthur Schmidt. Although Soviet commanders suggested postponing the bombardment due to poor visibility from thick fog, front headquarters decided to proceed. At 07:20 Moscow time (05:20 German time) Soviet artillery commanders received the codeword &quot;Siren&quot;, prompting an 80-minute artillery bombardment directed almost entirely against the non-German Axis units protecting the German flanks. At 07:30, the Katyusha rocket-launchers fired the first salvos and were soon joined by the 3,500 guns and mortars stretching along the few breakthrough sectors in front of the Third Romanian Army and the northern shoulder of the German Sixth Army&#x27;s flank. Although thick fog prevented the Soviet artillery from correcting their aim, their weeks of preparation and ranging allowed them to lay down accurate fire on enemy positions along the front. The effect was devastating, as communication lines were breached, ammunition dumps destroyed and forward observation points shattered. Many Romanian personnel who survived the bombardment began to flee to the rear. Soviet heavy artillery aimed at Romanian artillery positions and second-echelon formations also caught the retreating Romanian soldiers.

===Against the Third Romanian Army and the northern flank: 19 November===

The offensive against the Third Romanian Army began at 08:50, led by the 21st and 65th Soviet Armies and the 5th Tank Army. The first two assaults were repulsed by the Romanian defenders, and the effects of the heavy artillery bombardment had actually made it more difficult for Soviet armor to navigate through the minefields and terrain. However, the lack of heavy anti-tank artillery caused the Romanian defense to collapse; a breakthrough by the 4th Tank Corps and 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps was established by noon. Soon after, the 5th Tank Army was able to gain a breakthrough against the Second Romanian Corps, followed by the Eighth Cavalry Corps. As Soviet armor navigated through the thick fog by compass, overrunning Romanian and German artillery positions, three Romanian infantry divisions began to fall back in disarray; the Third Romanian Army had been outflanked to the west and east. After receiving the news of the Soviet attack, Sixth Army headquarters failed to order the 16th and 24th Panzer Divisions, hitherto engaged in Stalingrad, to reorient themselves to bolster the Romanian defenses; instead the task was given to the seriously understrength and poorly equipped 48th Panzer Corps.

The 48th Panzer Corps had fewer than 100 serviceable modern tanks. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and the shortage of tanks forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed part of the corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company of tanks. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to suffer from the worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment and blocked gunsights. It was not uncommon for tanks to lose traction and for crew members to break their arm from being tossed around inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps&#x27; coordination.

The rout of the Third Romanian Army began by the end of 19 November. The Soviet 21st Army and 5th Tank Army captured 27,000 Romanians—the bulk of three divisions—and then continued their advance southwards. Soviet cavalry was used to exploit the breakthrough, sever communications between the Romanians and the Italian 8th Army, and to block any counterattack against the Soviet flank. While the Red Air Force strafed retreating Romanian soldiers, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; provided only negligible opposition. The withdrawal of the 1st Romanian Cavalry Division, originally positioned on the German 376th Infantry Division&#x27;s flank, allowed the 65th Army to bypass German defenses. As German forces began to react late on 19 November, another attack was launched on the Sixth Army&#x27;s southern flank.

===Against the German southern flank: 20 November===

In the early morning of 20 November &quot;Stavka&quot; telephoned Stalingrad Front commander Andrei Yeremenko asking if he would begin his portion of the offensive on schedule, at 08:00. He responded he would do so only if the fog lifted; although the 51st Army opened its artillery barrage on time because front headquarters could not contact the division, the rest of the forces prepared for the operation received orders to postpone the attack until 10:00. The 51st Army engaged the Romanian 6th Corps, taking many prisoners. As the 57th Army joined the attack at 10:00, the situation developed in such a way that the Stalingrad Front could throw its armored corps into battle. The German 297th Infantry Division watched as its Romanian support failed to put up resistance against the Red Army. However, confusion and lack of control caused the Soviet 4th and 13th Mechanized Corps to stumble as they began to exploit the breakthroughs achieved by the opening offensive.

The Germans responded quickly by redeploying their only reserve in the area, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division. Despite initial victories against Soviet armored forces, the Romanian collapse forced the division to again redeploy in an attempt to shore up defenses to the south. The 29th Panzergrenadier Division&#x27;s counterattack cost the Red Army around fifty tanks, and caused Soviet commanders to worry about the safety of their left flank. However, the German division&#x27;s redeployment meant that by the end of the day only the 6th Romanian Cavalry Regiment stood between advancing Soviet forces and the Don River.

===Continued operations: 20–23 November===

While the Stalingrad Front launched its offensive on 20 November, the 65th Soviet Army continued to apply pressure to the German 11th Corps along the northern shoulder of the Sixth Army&#x27;s flank. The Red Army&#x27;s 4th Tank Corps advanced beyond the German 11th Corps, while the 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps crashed into the German unit&#x27;s rear. The German 376th Infantry Division and the Austrian 44th Infantry Division began to redeploy to face the enemy on their flanks, but were hindered by shortage of fuel. The 14th Panzer Division&#x27;s panzer regiment destroyed a flanking regiment of the Soviet 3rd Guards Cavalry Corps, but its anti-tank artillery suffered heavy casualties when it was overrun by Soviet forces. By the end of the day the Soviet 1st Tank Corps was chasing the retreating 48th Panzer Corps, while the Soviet 26th Tank Corps had captured the town of Perelazovsky, almost to the northwest of Stalingrad.

The Red Army&#x27;s offensive continued on 21 November, with forces of the Stalingrad Front achieving penetrations of up to . By this time remaining Romanian units in the north were being destroyed in isolated battles, while the Red Army began to engage flanking portions of the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies. The German 22nd Panzer Division, despite attempting a short counterattack, was reduced to little more than a tank company and forced to withdraw to the southwest. The Soviet 26th Tank Corps, having destroyed a large portion of the Romanian 1st Armored Division, continued its advance to the southeast, avoiding engaging enemy left behind, although remnants of the Romanian 5th Corps were able to reorganize and put up a hastily constructed defense in the hope that it would be aided by the German 48th Panzer Corps. Surrounded by 5th Tank Army on one side and 21st Army on the other, the bulk of 3rd Romanian Army was isolated in the region of Raspopinskaya where General Lascăr took control of the remnants of 4th and 5th Corps, whereas the neighboring 1st Armored Division was still trying to break free and link with 22nd Panzer Division. That day German General Friedrich Paulus, commander of the Sixth Army, received reports that the Soviets were less than from his headquarters; furthermore, there were no remaining units which could contest the Soviet advance. In the south, after a brief halt, the Soviet 4th Mechanized Corps continued its advance north, removing German defenders from several towns in the area, towards Stalingrad. As German forces in and around Stalingrad were at risk, Hitler ordered German forces in the area to establish an &quot;all-around defensive position&quot; and designated forces between the Don and Volga rivers as &quot;Fortress Stalingrad&quot;, rather than allow the Sixth Army to attempt to break out. The Sixth Army, other Axis units, and most of the Fourth Panzer Army&#x27;s German units were caught inside the growing Soviet encirclement. Only the 16th Panzergrenadier Division began to fight its way out. Lack of coordination between Soviet tanks and infantry as the Red Army&#x27;s tank corps attempted to exploit the breakthrough along the Germans&#x27; southern flank allowed much of the Fourth Romanian Army to escape destruction.

On 22 November Soviet forces began to cross the Don River and continued their advance towards the town of Kalach-on-the-Don. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, were not aware of the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach was given to the Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army&#x27;s 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. Meanwhile, on a later date of Dec.13, the 26th Tank Corps split of southwards along the Liska river inlet in a small advance towards a bridge near the town of Nish Tschirskaya. The reason for the attack was not only to push the German forces away from the railroads leading to Stalingrad but to also cut the support provided to the German 6th army still surrounded near the Don. The Russian forces had attacked the German positions with a bombardment from &quot;BM-13&quot; Katyusha rocket launchers which were followed by a tank attack of mostly T-34s. The attack lead to the retreat of the German forces in the area. The attack encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.

The encirclement of 6th Army was effective on 23 November. Around 16:00, near the village of Sovetsky, the forward detachments of 36th Mechanized Brigade from the Stalingrad Front&#x27;s 4th Mechanized Corps sighted the approaching tanks of 45th Brigade from the Southwestern Front&#x27;s 4th Tank Corps. At first they mistook them for Germans because they did not fire green flares as was agreed for a reconnaissance signal and several tanks were damaged in a short exchange of fire. After clarification the linkup was achieved. It was reenacted later for the newsreels.

The junction between the armored troops of 21st and 51st Armies from Vatutin&#x27;s and Yeremenko&#x27;s fronts completed the surrounding of Paulus&#x27;s group of forces: two German armies among the most powerful in the &quot;Heer&quot;, 22 divisions and 150 separate regiments or battalions, and an enormous amount of materiel. Never before in the war were so many troops of the German army caught together. Such a feat was so unusual that the &quot;Stavka&quot;″s own initial estimation of the encircled enemy force was only a quarter of its actual strength, because besides the fighting troops there was a huge number of extra personnel from various professions, engineer sections, Luftwaffe ground staff and others. Fighting continued on 23 November as the Germans attempted in vain to mount local counterattacks to break the encirclement. By this time Axis personnel inside the encirclement moved east towards Stalingrad to avoid Soviet tanks, while those that managed to escape the encirclement moved west toward German and other Axis forces.

==Aftermath==
Operation Uranus trapped between 250,000 and 300,000 Axis soldiers within an area stretching from east to west and north to south. The pocket contained four infantry corps, a panzer corps belonging to the Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and surviving elements of two Romanian divisions, a Croatian infantry regiment and other specialist units. Trapped equipment included around 100 tanks, 2,000 artillery pieces and mortars and 10,000 trucks. The withdrawal to Stalingrad left lines of retreat littered with helmets, weapons and other equipment, and heavy equipment which had been destroyed was left on the side of the road. Bridges spanning the Don River were jammed with traffic, as surviving Axis soldiers hastily made their way westwards in the cold weather, attempting to escape Soviet armor and infantry threatening to cut them off from Stalingrad. Many wounded Axis personnel were trampled, and many of those who attempted to cross the river on foot on the ice fell through and drowned. Hungry soldiers filled Russian villages scouring for supplies, while supply dumps were often looted in search of cans of food. The last stragglers crossed the Don River by 24 November, and demolished the bridges to seal off the Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies from the Soviets in Stalingrad.

The Sixth Army, in the midst of chaos, began to build defensive lines, hampered by the lack of fuel, ammunition and rations, and further burdened by the advancing Russian winter. It was also tasked with plugging gaps in the line caused by the disintegrating Romanian forces. On 23 November, some German units destroyed or burned everything not necessary for a breakout operation and began to pull back towards the northern end of Stalingrad. However, after the Germans had abandoned their winter bunkers, the Soviet 62nd Army was able to destroy the German 94th Infantry Division on the open ground; survivors of the German division were attached to the 16th and 24th Panzer Divisions. Although German military commanders were of the opinion that &quot;Heer&quot; forces caught in the encirclement should break out, between 23 and 24 November Hitler decided instead to hold the position and attempt to resupply the Sixth Army by air. The personnel trapped in Stalingrad would require at least of supplies per day, a task which the depleted &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was in no condition to carry out. Furthermore, the revived Red Air Force was a threat to German aircraft attempting to fly over the encirclement. Although by December the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had assembled a fleet of around 500 aircraft, this was still insufficient to supply the Sixth Army and elements of the Fourth Panzer Army with the required supplies. During the first half of December the Sixth Army received less than 20% of their daily requirements.

In the meantime, the Red Army strengthened its outer encirclement with the intention of destroying the encircled German units. Soviet armies would attack German units to the east and the south, aiming to split German units into smaller groups. These orders became effective on 24 November, and were to be executed without a major regrouping or movement of reserves. The outer encirclement ran for an estimated , although only three-quarters of that distance was actually covered by Soviet troops; the distance between the outer and inner encirclements was around . The Soviet high command also began planning for Operation Saturn, which was aimed at destroying the Italian Eighth Army and cutting off German forces in the Caucasus. The Soviet &quot;Stavka&quot; planned &quot;Saturn&quot; to start on about 10 December.

German forces in the area had been further split up, as German general Erich von Manstein was given command of the newly created Army Group Don, comprising the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and the Third and Fourth Romanian Armies. Although the situation looked bleak for the Germans, a moment of relative calm had settled after the end of Operation Uranus; German and Soviet forces were planning their next movements.

The link-up of the Soviet forces, not filmed at the time, was later re-enacted for a propaganda film which was shown worldwide.

<text>Operation Kremlin (&quot;Fall Kreml&quot; in German) was a successful German deception operation against Soviet forces in May to June 1942.

After German troops captured the city of Kharkov in October 1941, the German High Command planned an offensive to destroy the Soviet forces toward the southern sector of the Eastern Front. To divert the attention of the Soviets from the thrust that would lead to the Battle of Stalingrad, on 29 May 1942, the High Command ordered &quot;the earliest possible resumption of the attack on Moscow&quot; by Army Group Centre.

The factor that made Operation Kremlin plausible to the Soviet High Command, the Stavka, was that it coincided with Soviet thinking, which the Germans had not known. The Soviets had already believed that the Germans would make a second attempt to take Moscow in a larger summer offensive in 1942. The directive given to Army Group Centre, which assigned two panzer divisions the identical missions that they had received in the previous autumn, could have been taken for the real thing, even by the German officers who were in the know. Most of them were kept in the dark about the deception, which made it all the more believable.

As part of Operation Kremlin, the Luftwaffe increased reconnaissance flights over and around Moscow, officers in charge of prisoner-of-war interrogations were given lists of questions to ask regarding Moscow&#x27;s defenses and sealed packets of Moscow maps were distributed down to regimental level. A readiness date of August 1 was planned.

Although postwar Soviet accounts insisted that Operation Kremlin had failed, the Soviet High Command and the General Staff appear to have been misled by the deception. &quot;Stalin, the Stavka, and the General Staff, apparently, at no time believed the German main attack would be aimed anywhere other than at Moscow. Vasilevskiy says they did not &#x27;exclude&#x27; an attack from the vicinity of Kursk to Voronezh but believed the final objective would, nevertheless, be Moscow.&quot; This is reinforced by Stalin&#x27;s statement as late as November 1942, &quot;The main aim of the Germans&#x27; summer offensive was to encircle Moscow and end the war in this year.&quot;

<doc id="262135" wikidata="Q335225" url="?curid=262135" title="Rocket engine">
<text>A rocket engine is a reaction engine, producing thrust in accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law by ejecting reaction mass rearward, usually a high-speed jet of high-temperature gas produced by the combustion of rocket propellants stored inside the rocket. However, non-combusting forms such as cold gas thrusters and nuclear thermal rockets also exist. Rocket vehicles carry their own oxidiser, unlike most combustion engines, so rocket engines can be used in a vacuum, and they can achieve great speed, beyond escape velocity. Vehicles commonly propelled by rocket engines include missiles, artillery shells, ballistic missiles and rockets of any size, from tiny fireworks to man-sized weapons to huge spaceships.

Compared to other types of jet engine, rocket engines are the lightest and have the highest thrust, but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest specific impulse). The ideal exhaust is hydrogen, the lightest of all elements, but chemical rockets produce a mix of heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity.

==Terminology==
Here, &quot;rocket&quot; is used as an abbreviation for &quot;rocket engine&quot;.

Thermal rockets use an inert propellant, heated by electricity (electrothermal propulsion) or a nuclear reactor (nuclear thermal rocket).

Chemical rockets are powered by exothermic reduction-oxidation chemical reactions of the propellant:

*Solid-fuel rockets (or solid-propellant rockets or motors) are chemical rockets which use propellant in a solid state.
*Liquid-propellant rockets use one or more propellants in a liquid state fed from tanks.
*Hybrid rockets use a solid propellant in the combustion chamber, to which a second liquid or gas oxidiser or propellant is added to permit combustion.
*Monopropellant rockets use a single propellant decomposed by a catalyst. The most common monopropellants are hydrazine and hydrogen peroxide.

==Principle of operation==

Rocket engines produce thrust by the expulsion of an exhaust fluid that has been accelerated to high speed through a propelling nozzle. The fluid is usually a gas created by high pressure () combustion of solid or liquid propellants, consisting of fuel and oxidiser components, within a combustion chamber. As the gases expand through the nozzle, they are accelerated to very high (supersonic) speed, and the reaction to this pushes the engine in the opposite direction. Combustion is most frequently used for practical rockets, as the laws of thermodynamics (specifically Carnot&#x27;s theorem) dictate that high temperatures and pressures are desirable for the best thermal efficiency. Nuclear thermal rockets are capable of higher efficiencies, but currently have environmental problems which preclude their routine use in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and cislunar space.

For model rocketry, an available alternative to combustion is the water rocket pressurized by compressed air, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or any other readily available, inert gas.

===Propellant===
Rocket propellant is mass that is stored, usually in some form of tank, or within the combustion chamber itself, prior to being ejected from a rocket engine in the form of a fluid jet to produce thrust.

Chemical rocket propellants are the most commonly used. These undergo exothermic chemical reactions producing a hot gas jet for propulsion. Alternatively, a chemically inert reaction mass can be heated by a high-energy power source through a heat exchanger in lieu of a combustion chamber.

Solid rocket propellants are prepared in a mixture of fuel and oxidising components called &quot;grain&quot;, and the propellant storage casing effectively becomes the combustion chamber.

===Injection===
Liquid-fuelled rockets force separate fuel and oxidiser components into the combustion chamber, where they mix and burn. Hybrid rocket engines use a combination of solid and liquid or gaseous propellants. Both liquid and hybrid rockets use &quot;injectors&quot; to introduce the propellant into the chamber. These are often an array of simple jets – holes through which the propellant escapes under pressure; but sometimes may be more complex spray nozzles. When two or more propellants are injected, the jets usually deliberately cause the propellants to collide as this breaks up the flow into smaller droplets that burn more easily.

===Combustion chamber===
For chemical rockets the combustion chamber is typically cylindrical, and flame holders, used to hold a part of the combustion in a slower-flowing portion of the combustion chamber, are not needed. The dimensions of the cylinder are such that the propellant is able to combust thoroughly; different rocket propellants require different combustion chamber sizes for this to occur.

This leads to a number called formula_1, the characteristic length:
:formula_2
where:
*formula_3 is the volume of the chamber
*formula_4 is the area of the throat of the nozzle.
L* is typically in the range of .

The temperatures and pressures typically reached in a rocket combustion chamber in order to achieve practical thermal efficiency are extreme compared to a non-afterburning airbreathing jet engine. No atmospheric nitrogen is present to dilute and cool the combustion, so the propellant mixture can reach true stoichiometric ratios. This, in combination with the high pressures, means that the rate of heat conduction through the walls is very high.

In order for fuel and oxidiser to flow into the chamber, the pressure of the propellants entering the combustion chamber must exceed the pressure inside the combustion chamber itself. This may be accomplished by a variety of design approaches including turbopumps or, in simpler engines, via sufficient tank pressure to advance fluid flow. Tank pressure may be maintained by several means, including a high-pressure helium pressurization system common to many large rocket engines or, in some newer rocket systems, by a bleed-off of high-pressure gas from the engine cycle to autogenously pressurize the propellant tanks For example, the self-pressurization gas system of the SpaceX Starship is a critical part of SpaceX strategy to reduce launch vehicle fluids from five in their legacy Falcon 9 vehicle family to just two in Starship, eliminating not only the helium tank pressurant but all hypergolic propellants as well as nitrogen for cold-gas reaction-control thrusters.

===Nozzle===
The hot gas produced in the combustion chamber is permitted to escape through an opening (the &quot;throat&quot;), and then through a diverging expansion section. When sufficient pressure is provided to the nozzle (about 2.5–3 times ambient pressure), the nozzle &quot;chokes&quot; and a supersonic jet is formed, dramatically accelerating the gas, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speeds vary, depending on the expansion ratio the nozzle is designed for, but exhaust speeds as high as ten times the speed of sound in air at sea level are not uncommon. About half of the rocket engine&#x27;s thrust comes from the unbalanced pressures inside the combustion chamber, and the rest comes from the pressures acting against the inside of the nozzle (see diagram). As the gas expands (adiabatically) the pressure against the nozzle&#x27;s walls forces the rocket engine in one direction while accelerating the gas in the other.

The most commonly used nozzle is the de Laval nozzle, a fixed geometry nozzle with a high expansion-ratio. The large bell- or cone-shaped nozzle extension beyond the throat gives the rocket engine its characteristic shape.

The exit static pressure of the exhaust jet depends on the chamber pressure and the ratio of exit to throat area of the nozzle. As exit pressure varies from the ambient (atmospheric) pressure, a choked nozzle is said to be
* under-expanded (exit pressure greater than ambient),
* perfectly expanded (exit pressure equals ambient),
* over-expanded (exit pressure less than ambient; shock diamonds form outside the nozzle), or
* grossly over-expanded (a shock wave forms inside the nozzle extension).

In practice, perfect expansion is only achievable with a variable–exit-area nozzle (since ambient pressure decreases as altitude increases), and is not possible above a certain altitude as ambient pressure approaches zero. If the nozzle is not perfectly expanded, then loss of efficiency occurs. Grossly over-expanded nozzles lose less efficiency, but can cause mechanical problems with the nozzle. Fixed-area nozzles become progressively more under-expanded as they gain altitude. Almost all de Laval nozzles will be momentarily grossly over-expanded during startup in an atmosphere.

Nozzle efficiency is affected by operation in the atmosphere because atmospheric pressure changes with altitude; but due to the supersonic speeds of the gas exiting from a rocket engine, the pressure of the jet may be either below or above ambient, and equilibrium between the two is not reached at all altitudes (see diagram).

====Back pressure and optimal expansion====
For optimal performance, the pressure of the gas at the end of the nozzle should just equal the ambient pressure: if the exhaust&#x27;s pressure is lower than the ambient pressure, then the vehicle will be slowed by the difference in pressure between the top of the engine and the exit; on the other hand, if the exhaust&#x27;s pressure is higher, then exhaust pressure that could have been converted into thrust is not converted, and energy is wasted.

To maintain this ideal of equality between the exhaust&#x27;s exit pressure and the ambient pressure, the diameter of the nozzle would need to increase with altitude, giving the pressure a longer nozzle to act on (and reducing the exit pressure and temperature). This increase is difficult to arrange in a lightweight fashion, although is routinely done with other forms of jet engines. In rocketry a lightweight compromise nozzle is generally used and some reduction in atmospheric performance occurs when used at other than the &#x27;design altitude&#x27; or when throttled. To improve on this, various exotic nozzle designs such as the plug nozzle, stepped nozzles, the expanding nozzle and the aerospike have been proposed, each providing some way to adapt to changing ambient air pressure and each allowing the gas to expand further against the nozzle, giving extra thrust at higher altitudes.

When exhausting into a sufficiently low ambient pressure (vacuum) several issues arise. One is the sheer weight of the nozzle—beyond a certain point, for a particular vehicle, the extra weight of the nozzle outweighs any performance gained. Secondly, as the exhaust gases adiabatically expand within the nozzle they cool, and eventually some of the chemicals can freeze, producing &#x27;snow&#x27; within the jet. This causes instabilities in the jet and must be avoided.

On a de Laval nozzle, exhaust gas flow detachment will occur in a grossly over-expanded nozzle. As the detachment point will not be uniform around the axis of the engine, a side force may be imparted to the engine. This side force may change over time and result in control problems with the launch vehicle.

Advanced altitude-compensating designs, such as the aerospike or plug nozzle, attempt to minimize performance losses by adjusting to varying expansion ratio caused by changing altitude.

===Propellant efficiency===
For a rocket engine to be propellant efficient, it is important that the maximum pressures possible be created on the walls of the chamber and nozzle by a specific amount of propellant; as this is the source of the thrust. This can be achieved by all of:

* heating the propellant to as high a temperature as possible (using a high energy fuel, containing hydrogen and carbon and sometimes metals such as aluminium, or even using nuclear energy)
* using a low specific density gas (as hydrogen rich as possible)
* using propellants which are, or decompose to, simple molecules with few degrees of freedom to maximise translational velocity

Since all of these things minimise the mass of the propellant used, and since pressure is proportional to the mass of propellant present to be accelerated as it pushes on the engine, and since from Newton&#x27;s third law the pressure that acts on the engine also reciprocally acts on the propellant, it turns out that for any given engine, the speed that the propellant leaves the chamber is unaffected by the chamber pressure (although the thrust is proportional). However, speed is significantly affected by all three of the above factors and the exhaust speed is an excellent measure of the engine propellant efficiency. This is termed &quot;exhaust velocity&quot;, and after allowance is made for factors that can reduce it, the effective exhaust velocity is one of the most important parameters of a rocket engine (although weight, cost, ease of manufacture etc. are usually also very important).

For aerodynamic reasons the flow goes sonic (&quot;chokes&quot;) at the narrowest part of the nozzle, the &#x27;throat&#x27;. Since the speed of sound in gases increases with the square root of temperature, the use of hot exhaust gas greatly improves performance. By comparison, at room temperature the speed of sound in air is about 340 m/s while the speed of sound in the hot gas of a rocket engine can be over 1700 m/s; much of this performance is due to the higher temperature, but additionally rocket propellants are chosen to be of low molecular mass, and this also gives a higher velocity compared to air.

Expansion in the rocket nozzle then further multiplies the speed, typically between 1.5 and 2 times, giving a highly collimated hypersonic exhaust jet. The speed increase of a rocket nozzle is mostly determined by its area expansion ratio—the ratio of the area of the exit to the area of the throat, but detailed properties of the gas are also important. Larger ratio nozzles are more massive but are able to extract more heat from the combustion gases, increasing the exhaust velocity.

===Thrust vectoring===

Vehicles typically require the overall thrust to change direction over the length of the burn. A number of different ways to achieve this have been flown:

* The entire engine is mounted on a hinge or gimbal and any propellant feeds reach the engine via low pressure flexible pipes or rotary couplings.
* Just the combustion chamber and nozzle is gimballed, the pumps are fixed, and high pressure feeds attach to the engine.
* Multiple engines (often canted at slight angles) are deployed but throttled to give the overall vector that is required, giving only a very small penalty.
* High-temperature vanes protrude into the exhaust and can be tilted to deflect the jet.

==Overall performance==
Rocket technology can combine very high thrust (meganewtons), very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times the speed of sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (&gt;100) &quot;simultaneously&quot; as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.

Rockets can be further optimised to even more extreme performance along one or more of these axes at the expense of the others.

===Specific impulse===

The most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is impulse per unit of propellant, this is called specific impulse (usually written formula_5). This is either measured as a speed (the &quot;effective exhaust velocity&quot; formula_6 in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds). For example, if an engine producing 100 pounds of thrust runs for 320 seconds and burns 100 pounds of propellant, then the specific impulse is 320 seconds. The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is required to provide the desired impulse.

The specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.

===Net thrust===

Below is an approximate equation for calculating the net thrust of a rocket engine:

Since, unlike a jet engine, a conventional rocket motor lacks an air intake, there is no &#x27;ram drag&#x27; to deduct from the gross thrust. Consequently, the net thrust of a rocket motor is equal to the gross thrust (apart from static back pressure).

The formula_7 term represents the momentum thrust, which remains constant at a given throttle setting, whereas the formula_8 term represents the pressure thrust term. At full throttle, the net thrust of a rocket motor improves slightly with increasing altitude, because as atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, the pressure thrust term increases. At the surface of the Earth the pressure thrust may be reduced by up to 30%, depending on the engine design. This reduction drops roughly exponentially to zero with increasing altitude.

Maximum efficiency for a rocket engine is achieved by maximising the momentum contribution of the equation without incurring penalties from over expanding the exhaust. This occurs when formula_9. Since ambient pressure changes with altitude, most rocket engines spend very little time operating at peak efficiency.

Since specific impulse is force divided by the rate of mass flow, this equation means that the specific impulse varies with altitude.

===Vacuum specific impulse, Isp===

Due to the specific impulse varying with pressure, a quantity that is easy to compare and calculate with is useful. Because rockets choke at the throat, and because the supersonic exhaust prevents external pressure influences travelling upstream, it turns out that the pressure at the exit is ideally exactly proportional to the propellant flow formula_10, provided the mixture ratios and combustion efficiencies are maintained. It is thus quite usual to rearrange the above equation slightly:

and so define the &quot;vacuum Isp&quot; to be:

where:


And hence:
===Throttling===

Rockets can be throttled by controlling the propellant combustion rate formula_10 (usually measured in kg/s or lb/s). In liquid and hybrid rockets, the propellant flow entering the chamber is controlled using valves, in solid rockets it is controlled by changing the area of propellant that is burning and this can be designed into the propellant grain (and hence cannot be controlled in real-time).

Rockets can usually be throttled down to an exit pressure of about one-third of ambient pressure (often limited by flow separation in nozzles) and up to a maximum limit determined only by the mechanical strength of the engine.

In practice, the degree to which rockets can be throttled varies greatly, but most rockets can be throttled by a factor of 2 without great difficulty; the typical limitation is combustion stability, as for example, injectors need a minimum pressure to avoid triggering damaging oscillations (chugging or combustion instabilities); but injectors can be optimised and tested for wider ranges.

For example, some more recent liquid-propellant engine designs that have been optimised for greater throttling capability (BE-3, Raptor) can be throttled to as low as 18–20 per cent of rated thrust.

Solid rockets can be throttled by using shaped grains that will vary their surface area over the course of the burn.

===Energy efficiency===
Rocket engine nozzles are surprisingly efficient heat engines for generating a high speed jet, as a consequence of the high combustion temperature and high compression ratio. Rocket nozzles give an excellent approximation to adiabatic expansion which is a reversible process, and hence they give efficiencies which are very close to that of the Carnot cycle. Given the temperatures reached, over 60% efficiency can be achieved with chemical rockets.

For a &quot;vehicle&quot; employing a rocket engine the energetic efficiency is very good if the vehicle speed approaches or somewhat exceeds the exhaust velocity (relative to launch); but at low speeds the energy efficiency goes to 0% at zero speed (as with all jet propulsion). See Rocket energy efficiency for more details.
===Thrust-to-weight ratio===

Rockets, of all the jet engines, indeed of essentially all engines, have the highest thrust-to-weight ratio. This is especially true for liquid-fuelled rocket engines.

This high performance is due to the small volume of pressure vessels that make up the engine—the pumps, pipes and combustion chambers involved. The lack of inlet duct and the use of dense liquid propellant allows the pressurisation system to be small and lightweight, whereas duct engines have to deal with air which has around three orders of magnitude lower density.

Of the liquid fuels used, density is lowest for liquid hydrogen. Although hydrogen/oxygen burning has the highest specific impulse of any in-use chemical rocket, hydrogen&#x27;s very low density (about one-fourteenth that of water) requires larger and heavier turbopumps and pipework, which decreases the engine&#x27;s thrust-to-weight ratio (for example the RS-25) compared to those that do not use hydrogen (NK-33).

==Mechanical issues==
Rocket combustion chambers are normally operated at fairly high pressure, typically 10–200bar (1–20MPa, 150–3,000psi). When operated within significant atmospheric pressure, higher combustion chamber pressures give better performance by permitting a larger and more efficient nozzle to be fitted without it being grossly overexpanded.

However, these high pressures cause the outermost part of the chamber to be under very large hoop stresses – rocket engines are pressure vessels.

Worse, due to the high temperatures created in rocket engines the materials used tend to have a significantly lowered working tensile strength.

In addition, significant temperature gradients are set up in the walls of the chamber and nozzle, these cause differential expansion of the inner liner that create internal stresses.

=== Hard starts ===
A hard start refers to an over-pressure condition during start of a rocket engine at ignition. In the worst cases, this takes the form of an unconfined explosion, resulting in the damage or destruction of the engine.

Rocket fuels, hypergolic or otherwise, must be introduced into the combustion chamber at the correct rate in order to have a controlled rate of production of hot gas. A &quot;hard start&quot; indicates that the quantity of combustible propellant that entered the combustion chamber prior to ignition was too large. The result is an excessive spike of pressure, possibly leading to structural failure or explosion.

Avoiding hard starts involves careful timing of the ignition relative to valve timing or varying the mixture ratio so as to limit the maximum pressure that can occur or simply ensuring an adequate ignition source is present well prior to propellant entering the chamber.

Explosions from hard starts usually cannot happen with purely gaseous propellants, since the amount of the gas present in the chamber is limited by the injector area relative to the throat area, and for practical designs, propellant mass escapes too quickly to be an issue.

A famous example of a hard start was the explosion of Wernher von Braun&#x27;s &quot;1W&quot; engine during a demonstration to General Walter Dornberger on December 21, 1932. Delayed ignition allowed the chamber to fill with alcohol and liquid oxygen, which exploded violently. Shrapnel was embedded in the walls, but nobody was hit.

==Acoustic issues==
The extreme vibration and acoustic environment inside a rocket motor commonly result in peak stresses well above mean values, especially in the presence of organ pipe-like resonances and gas turbulence.

===Combustion instabilities===
The combustion may display undesired instabilities, of sudden or periodic nature. The pressure in the injection chamber may increase until the propellant flow through the injector plate decreases; a moment later the pressure drops and the flow increases, injecting more propellant in the combustion chamber which burns a moment later, and again increases the chamber pressure, repeating the cycle. This may lead to high-amplitude pressure oscillations, often in ultrasonic range, which may damage the motor. Oscillations of ±200 psi at 25 kHz were the cause of failures of early versions of the Titan II missile second stage engines. The other failure mode is a deflagration to detonation transition; the supersonic pressure wave formed in the combustion chamber may destroy the engine.

Combustion instability was also a problem during Atlas development. The Rocketdyne engines used in the Atlas family were found to suffer from this effect in several static firing tests, and three missile launches exploded on the pad due to rough combustion in the booster engines. In most cases, it occurred while attempting to start the engines with a &quot;dry start&quot; method whereby the igniter mechanism would be activated prior to propellant injection. During the process of man-rating Atlas for Project Mercury, solving combustion instability was a high priority, and the final two Mercury flights sported an upgraded propulsion system with baffled injectors and a hypergolic igniter.

The problem affecting Atlas vehicles was mainly the so-called &quot;racetrack&quot; phenomenon, where burning propellant would swirl around in a circle at faster and faster speeds, eventually producing vibration strong enough to rupture the engine, leading to complete destruction of the rocket. It was eventually solved by adding several baffles around the injector face to break up swirling propellant.

More significantly, combustion instability was a problem with the Saturn F-1 engines. Some of the early units tested exploded during static firing, which led to the addition of injector baffles.

In the Soviet space program, combustion instability also proved a problem on some rocket engines, including the RD-107 engine used in the R-7 family and the RD-216 used in the R-14 family, and several failures of these vehicles occurred before the problem was solved. Soviet engineering and manufacturing processes never satisfactorily resolved combustion instability in larger RP-1/LOX engines, so the RD-171 engine used to power the Zenit family still used four smaller thrust chambers fed by a common engine mechanism.

The combustion instabilities can be provoked by remains of cleaning solvents in the engine (e.g. the first attempted launch of a Titan II in 1962), reflected shock wave, initial instability after ignition, explosion near the nozzle that reflects into the combustion chamber, and many more factors. In stable engine designs the oscillations are quickly suppressed; in unstable designs they persist for prolonged periods. Oscillation suppressors are commonly used.

Three different types of combustion instabilities occur:

====Chugging====
A low frequency oscillation in chamber pressure below 200 Hertz. Usually it is caused by pressure variations in feed lines due to variations in acceleration of the vehicle, when rocket engines are building up thrust, are shut down or are being throttled.

Chugging can cause a worsening feedback loop, as cyclic variation in thrust causes longitudinal vibrations to travel up the rocket, causing the fuel lines to vibrate, which in turn do not deliver propellant smoothly into the engines. This phenomenon is known as &quot;pogo oscillations&quot; or &quot;pogo&quot;, named after the pogo stick.

In the worst case, this may result in damage to the payload or vehicle. Chugging can be minimised by using several methods, such as installing energy-absorbing devices on feed lines. Chugging may cause Screeching.

====Buzzing====
An intermediate frequency oscillation in chamber pressure between 200 and 1000 Hertz. Usually caused due to insufficient pressure drop across the injectors. It generally is mostly annoying, rather than being damaging.

Buzzing is known to have adverse effects on engine performance and reliability, primarily as it causes material fatigue. In extreme cases combustion can end up being forced backwards through the injectors – this can cause explosions with monopropellants. Buzzing may cause Screeching.

====Screeching====
A high frequency oscillation in chamber pressure above 1000 Hertz, sometimes called screaming or squealing. The most immediately damaging, and the hardest to control. It is due to acoustics within the combustion chamber that often couples to the chemical combustion processes that are the primary drivers of the energy release, and can lead to unstable resonant &quot;screeching&quot; that commonly leads to catastrophic failure due to thinning of the insulating thermal boundary layer. Acoustic oscillations can be excited by thermal processes, such as the flow of hot air through a pipe or combustion in a chamber. Specifically, standing acoustic waves inside a chamber can be intensified if combustion occurs more intensely in regions where the pressure of the acoustic wave is maximal.

Such effects are very difficult to predict analytically during the design process, and have usually been addressed by expensive, time-consuming and extensive testing, combined with trial and error remedial correction measures.

Screeching is often dealt with by detailed changes to injectors, changes in the propellant chemistry, vaporising the propellant before injection or use of Helmholtz dampers within the combustion chambers to change the resonant modes of the chamber.

Testing for the possibility of screeching is sometimes done by exploding small explosive charges outside the combustion chamber with a tube set tangentially to the combustion chamber near the injectors to determine the engine&#x27;s impulse response and then evaluating the time response of the chamber pressure- a fast recovery indicates a stable system.

===Exhaust noise===

For all but the very smallest sizes, rocket exhaust compared to other engines is generally very noisy. As the hypersonic exhaust mixes with the ambient air, shock waves are formed. The Space Shuttle generated over 200 dB(A) of noise around its base. To reduce this, and the risk of payload damage or injury to the crew atop the stack, the mobile launcher platform was fitted with a Sound Suppression System that sprayed of water around the base of the rocket in 41 seconds at launch time. Using this system kept sound levels within the payload bay to 142 dB.

The sound intensity from the shock waves generated depends on the size of the rocket and on the exhaust velocity. Such shock waves seem to account for the characteristic crackling and popping sounds produced by large rocket engines when heard live. These noise peaks typically overload microphones and audio electronics, and so are generally weakened or entirely absent in recorded or broadcast audio reproductions. For large rockets at close range, the acoustic effects could actually kill.

More worryingly for space agencies, such sound levels can also damage the launch structure, or worse, be reflected back at the comparatively delicate rocket above. This is why so much water is typically used at launches. The water spray changes the acoustic qualities of the air and reduces or deflects the sound energy away from the rocket.

Generally speaking, noise is most intense when a rocket is close to the ground, since the noise from the engines radiates up away from the jet, as well as reflecting off the ground. Also, when the vehicle is moving slowly, little of the chemical energy input to the engine can go into increasing the kinetic energy of the rocket (since useful power &quot;P&quot; transmitted to the vehicle is formula_12 for thrust &quot;F&quot; and speed &quot;V&quot;). Then the largest portion of the energy is dissipated in the exhaust&#x27;s interaction with the ambient air, producing noise. This noise can be reduced somewhat by flame trenches with roofs, by water injection around the jet and by deflecting the jet at an angle.

== Rocket engine development ==
=== United States ===
The development of the US rocket engine industry has been shaped by a complex web of relationships between government agencies, private companies, research institutions, and other stakeholders.

Since the establishment of the first liquid-propellant rocket engine company (Reaction Motors, Inc.) in 1941 and the first government laboratory (GALCIT) devoted to the subject, the US liquid-propellant rocket engine (LPRE) industry has undergone significant changes. At least 14 US companies have been involved in the design, development, manufacture, testing, and flight support operations of various types of rocket engines from 1940 to 2000. In contrast to other countries like Russia, China, or India, where only government or pseudogovernment organisations engage in this business, the US government relies heavily on private industry. These commercial companies are essential to the continued viability of the United States and its form of governance, as they compete with one another to provide cutting-edge rocket engines that meet the needs of the government, the military, and the private sector. In the United States the company that develops the LPRE usually is awarded the production contract.

Generally, the need or demand for a new rocket engine comes from government agencies such as NASA or the Department of Defense. Once the need is identified, government agencies may issue requests for proposals (RFPs) to solicit proposals from private companies and research institutions. Private companies and research institutions, in turn, may invest in research and development (R&amp;D) activities to develop new rocket engine technologies that meet the needs and specifications outlined in the RFPs.

Alongside private companies, universities, independent research institutes and government laboratories also play a critical role in the research and development of rocket engines.

Universities provide graduate and undergraduate education to train qualified technical personnel, and their research programs often contribute to the advancement of rocket engine technologies. More than 25 universities in the US have taught or are currently teaching courses related to Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines (LPREs), and their graduate and undergraduate education programs are considered one of their most important contributions. Universities such as Princeton University, Cornell University, Purdue University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Alabama, the Navy&#x27;s Post-Graduate School, or the California Institute of Technology have conducted excellent R&amp;D work on topics related to the rocket engine industry. One of the earliest examples of the contribution of universities to the rocket engine industry is the work of the GALCIT in 1941. They demonstrated the first jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rockets to the Army, leading to the establishment of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

However the transfer of knowledge from research professors and their projects to the rocket engine industry has been a mixed experience. While some notable professors and relevant research projects have positively influenced industry practices and understanding of LPREs, the connection between university research and commercial companies has been inconsistent and weak. Universities were not always aware of the industry&#x27;s specific needs, and engineers and designers in the industry had limited knowledge of university research. As a result, many university research programs remained relatively unknown to industry decision-makers. Furthermore, in the last few decades, certain university research projects, while interesting to professors, were not useful to the industry due to a lack of communication or relevance to industry needs.

Government laboratories, including the Rocket Propulsion Laboratory (now part of Air Force Research Laboratory), Arnold Engineering Test Center, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stennis Space Center, White Sands Proving Grounds, and NASA John H. Glenn Research Center, have played crucial roles in the development of liquid rocket propulsion engines (LPREs). They have conducted unbiased testing, guided work at US and some non-US contractors, performed research and development, and provided essential testing facilities including hover test facilities and simulated altitude test facilities and resources. Initially, private companies or foundations financed smaller test facilities, but since the 1950s, the U.S. government has funded larger test facilities at government laboratories. This approach reduced costs for the government by not building similar facilities at contractors&#x27; plants but increased complexity and expenses for contractors. Nonetheless, government laboratories have solidified their significance and contributed to LPRE advancements.

LPRE programs have been subject to several cancellations in the United States, even after spending millions of dollars on their development. For example, the M-l LOX/LH2 LPRE, Titan I, and the RS-2200 aerospike, as well as several JATO units and large uncooled thrust chambers were cancelled. The cancellations of these programs were not related to the specific LPRE&#x27;s performance or any issues with it. Instead, they were due to the cancellation of the vehicle programs the engine was intended for or budget cuts imposed by the government.

=== USSR ===
Russia and the former Soviet Union was and still is the world&#x27;s foremost nation in developing and building rocket engines. From 1950 to 1998, their organisations developed, built, and put into operation a larger number and a larger variety of liquid propellant rocket engine (LPRE) designs than any other country. Approximately 500 different LPREs have been developed before 2003. For comparison the United States has developed slightly more than 300 (before 2003). The Soviets also had the most rocket-propelled flight vehicles. They had more liquid propellant ballistic missiles and more space launch vehicles derived or converted from these decommissioned ballistic missiles than any other nation. As of the end of 1998, the Russians (or earlier the Soviet Union) had successfully launched 2573 satellites with LPREs or almost 65% of the world total of 3973. All of these vehicle flights were made possible by the timely development of suitable high-performance reliable LPREs.

==== Institutions and actors ====
Unlike many other countries where the development and production of rocket engines were consolidated within a single organisation, the Soviet Union took a different approach, they established numerous specialised design bureaus (DB) which would compete for development contracts. These design bureaus, or &quot;konstruktorskoye buro&quot; (KB) in Russian were state run organisations which were primarily responsible for carrying out research, development and prototyping of advanced technologies usually related to military hardware, such as turbojet engines, aircraft components, missiles, or space launch vehicles.

Design Bureaus which specialised in rocket engines often possessed the necessary personnel, facilities, and equipment to conduct laboratory tests, flow tests, and ground testing of experimental rocket engines. Some even had specialised facilities for testing very large engines, conducting static firings of engines installed in vehicle stages, or simulating altitude conditions during engine tests. In certain cases, engine testing, certification and quality control were outsourced to other organisations and locations with more suitable test facilities. Many DBs also had housing complexes, gymnasiums, and medical facilities intended to support the needs of their employees and their families.

The Soviet Union&#x27;s LPRE development effort saw significant growth during the 1960s and reached its peak in the 1970s. This era coincided with the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, characterised by intense competition in spaceflight achievements. Between 14 and 17 Design Bureaus and research institutes were actively involved in developing LPREs during this period. These organisations received relatively steady support and funding due to high military and spaceflight priorities, which facilitated the continuous development of new engine concepts and manufacturing methods.

Once a mission with a new vehicle (missile or spacecraft) was established it was passed on to a design bureau whose role was to oversee the development of the entire rocket. If none of the previously developed rocket engines met the needs of the mission, a new rocket engine with specific requirements would be contracted to another DB specialised in LPRE development (oftentimes each DB had expertise in specific types of LPREs with different applications, propellants, or engine sizes). This meant that the development or design study of a rocket engine was always aimed at a specific application which entailed set requirements.

When it comes to which DBs were awarded contracts for the development of new rocket engines either a single design bureau would be chosen or several design bureaus would be given the same contract which sometimes led to fierce competition between DBs.

When only one DB was picked for the development, it was often the result of the relationship between a vehicle or system&#x27;s chief designer and the chief designer of a rocket engine specialised DB. If the vehicle&#x27;s chief designer was happy with previous work done by a certain design bureau it was not unusual to see continued reliance on that LPRE bureau for that class of engines. For example, all but one of the LPREs for submarine-launched missiles were developed by the same design bureau for the same vehicle development prime contractor.

However, when two parallel engine development programs were supported in order to select the superior one for a specific application, several qualified rocket engine models were never used. This luxury of choice was not commonly available in other nations. However, the use of design bureaus also led to certain issues, including program cancellations and duplication. Some major programs were cancelled, resulting in the disposal or storage of previously developed engines.

One notable example of duplication and cancellation was the development of engines for the R-9A ballistic missile. Two sets of engines were supported, but ultimately only one set was selected, leaving several perfectly functional engines unused. Similarly, for the ambitious heavy N-l space launch vehicle intended for lunar and planetary missions, the Soviet Union developed and put into production at least two engines for each of the six stages. Additionally, they developed alternate engines for a more advanced N-l vehicle. However, the program faced multiple flight failures, and with the United States&#x27; successful Moon landing, the program was ultimately cancelled, leaving the Soviet Union with a surplus of newly qualified engines without a clear purpose.

These examples demonstrate the complex dynamics and challenges faced by the Soviet Union in managing the development and production of rocket engines through Design Bureaus.

==== Accidents ====
The development of rocket engines in the Soviet Union was marked by significant achievements, but it also carried ethical considerations due to numerous accidents and fatalities. From a Science and Technology Studies point of view, the ethical implications of these incidents shed light on the complex relationship between technology, human factors, and the prioritisation of scientific advancement over safety.

The Soviet Union encountered a series of tragic accidents and mishaps in the development and operation of rocket engines. Notably, the USSR holds the unfortunate distinction of having experienced more injuries and deaths resulting from liquid propellant rocket engine (LPRE) accidents than any other country. These incidents brought into question the ethical considerations surrounding the development, testing, and operational use of rocket engines.

One of the most notable disasters occurred in 1960 when the R-16 ballistic missile suffered a catastrophic accident on the launchpad at the Tyuratam launch facility. This incident resulted in the deaths of 124 engineers and military personnel, including Marshal M.I. Nedelin, a former deputy minister of defence. The explosion occurred after the second-stage rocket engine suddenly ignited, causing the fully loaded missile to disintegrate. The explosion resulted from the ignition and explosion of the mixed hypergolic propellants, consisting of nitric acid with additives and UDMH (unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine).

While the immediate cause of the 1960 accident was attributed to a lack of protective circuits in the missile control unit, the ethical considerations surrounding LPRE accidents in the USSR extend beyond specific technical failures. The secrecy surrounding these accidents, which remained undisclosed for approximately three decades, raises concerns about transparency, accountability, and the protection of human life.

The decision to keep fatal LPRE accidents hidden from the public eye reflects a broader ethical dilemma. The Soviet government, driven by the pursuit of scientific and technological superiority during the Cold War, sought to maintain an image of invincibility and conceal the failures that accompanied their advancements. This prioritisation of national prestige over the well-being and safety of workers raises questions about the ethical responsibility of the state and the organisations involved.

==Testing==

Rocket engines are usually statically tested at a test facility before being put into production. For high altitude engines, either a shorter nozzle must be used, or the rocket must be tested in a large vacuum chamber.

==Safety==
Rocket vehicles have a reputation for unreliability and danger; especially catastrophic failures. Contrary to this reputation, carefully designed rockets can be made arbitrarily reliable. In military use, rockets are not unreliable. However, one of the main non-military uses of rockets is for orbital launch. In this application, the premium has typically been placed on minimum weight, and it is difficult to achieve high reliability and low weight simultaneously. In addition, if the number of flights launched is low, there is a very high chance of a design, operations or manufacturing error causing destruction of the vehicle.

===Saturn family (1961–1975)===
The Rocketdyne H-1 engine, used in a cluster of eight in the first stage of the Saturn I and Saturn IB launch vehicles, had no catastrophic failures in 152 engine-flights. The Pratt and Whitney RL10 engine, used in a cluster of six in the Saturn I second stage, had no catastrophic failures in 36 engine-flights. The Rocketdyne F-1 engine, used in a cluster of five in the first stage of the Saturn V, had no failures in 65 engine-flights. The Rocketdyne J-2 engine, used in a cluster of five in the Saturn V second stage, and singly in the Saturn IB second stage and Saturn V third stage, had no catastrophic failures in 86 engine-flights.

===Space Shuttle (1981–2011)===
The Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, used in pairs, caused one notable catastrophic failure in 270 engine-flights.

The RS-25, used in a cluster of three, flew in 46 refurbished engine units. These made a total of 405 engine-flights with no catastrophic in-flight failures. A single in-flight RS-25 engine failure occurred during &#x27;s STS-51-F mission. This failure had no effect on mission objectives or duration.

==Cooling==
For efficiency reasons, higher temperatures are desirable, but materials lose their strength if the temperature becomes too high. Rockets run with combustion temperatures that can reach .

Most other jet engines have gas turbines in the hot exhaust. Due to their larger surface area, they are harder to cool and hence there is a need to run the combustion processes at much lower temperatures, losing efficiency. In addition, use air as an oxidant, which contains 78% largely unreactive nitrogen, which dilutes the reaction and lowers the temperatures. Rockets have none of these inherent combustion temperature limiters.

The temperatures reached by combustion in rocket engines often substantially exceed the melting points of the nozzle and combustion chamber materials (about 1,200 K for copper). Most construction materials will also combust if exposed to high temperature oxidiser, which leads to a number of design challenges. The nozzle and combustion chamber walls must not be allowed to combust, melt, or vaporize (sometimes facetiously termed an &quot;engine-rich exhaust&quot;).

Rockets that use common construction materials such as aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys must employ cooling systems to limit the temperatures that engine structures experience. Regenerative cooling, where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as film cooling, are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life. These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal boundary layer touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.

Material exceptions that can sustain rocket combustion temperatures to a certain degree are carbon–carbon materials and rhenium, although both are subject to oxidation under certain conditions. Other refractory alloys, such as alumina, molybdenum, tantalum or tungsten have been tried, but were given up on due to various issues.

Materials technology, combined with the engine design, is a limiting factor in chemical rockets.

In rockets, the heat fluxes that can pass through the wall are among the highest in engineering; fluxes are generally in the range of 0.8–80 MW/m (0.5-50 BTU/in-sec). The strongest heat fluxes are found at the throat, which often sees twice that found in the associated chamber and nozzle. This is due to the combination of high speeds (which gives a very thin boundary layer), and although lower than the chamber, the high temperatures seen there. (See above for temperatures in nozzle).

In rockets the coolant methods include:

#Ablative: The combustion chamber inside walls are lined with a material that traps heat and carries it away with the exhaust as it vaporizes.
#Radiative cooling: The engine is made of one or several refractory materials, which take heat flux until its outer thrust chamber wall glows red- or white-hot, radiating the heat away.
#Dump cooling: A cryogenic propellant, usually hydrogen, is passed around the nozzle and dumped. This cooling method has various issues, such as wasting propellant. It is only used rarely.
#Regenerative cooling: The fuel (and possibly, the oxidiser) of a liquid rocket engine is routed around the nozzle before being injected into the combustion chamber or preburner. This is the most widely applied method of rocket engine cooling.
#Film cooling: The engine is designed with rows of multiple orifices lining the inside wall through which additional propellant is injected, cooling the chamber wall as it evaporates. This method is often used in cases where the heat fluxes are especially high, likely in combination with regenerative cooling. A more efficient subtype of film cooling is transpiration cooling, in which propellant passes through a porous inner combustion chamber wall and transpirates. So far, this method has not seen usage due to various issues with this concept.

Rocket engines may also use several cooling methods. Examples:

* Regeneratively and film cooled combustion chamber and nozzle: V-2 Rocket Engine
* Regeneratively cooled combustion chamber with a film cooled nozzle extension: Rocketdyne F-1 Engine
* Regeneratively cooled combustion chamber with an ablatively cooled nozzle extension: The LR-91 rocket engine
* Ablatively and film cooled combustion chamber with a radiatively cooled nozzle extension: Lunar module descent engine (LMDE), Service propulsion system engine (SPS)
* Radiatively and film cooled combustion chamber with a radiatively cooled nozzle extension: R-4D storable propellant thrusters

In all cases, another effect that aids in cooling the rocket engine chamber wall is a thin layer of combustion gases (a boundary layer) that is notably cooler than the combustion temperature. Disruption of the boundary layer may occur during cooling failures or combustion instabilities, and wall failure typically occurs soon after.

With regenerative cooling a second boundary layer is found in the coolant channels around the chamber. This boundary layer thickness needs to be as small as possible, since the boundary layer acts as an insulator between the wall and the coolant. This may be achieved by making the coolant velocity in the channels as high as possible.

Liquid-fuelled engines are often run fuel-rich, which lowers combustion temperatures. This reduces heat loads on the engine and allows lower cost materials and a simplified cooling system. This can also &quot;increase&quot; performance by lowering the average molecular weight of the exhaust and increasing the efficiency with which combustion heat is converted to kinetic exhaust energy.

==Chemistry==
Rocket propellants require a high energy per unit mass (specific energy), which must be balanced against the tendency of highly energetic propellants to spontaneously explode. Assuming that the chemical potential energy of the propellants can be safely stored, the combustion process results in a great deal of heat being released. A significant fraction of this heat is transferred to kinetic energy in the engine nozzle, propelling the rocket forward in combination with the mass of combustion products released.

Ideally all the reaction energy appears as kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, as exhaust velocity is the single most important performance parameter of an engine. However, real exhaust species are molecules, which typically have translation, vibrational, and rotational modes with which to dissipate energy. Of these, only translation can do useful work to the vehicle, and while energy does transfer between modes this process occurs on a timescale far in excess of the time required for the exhaust to leave the nozzle.

The more chemical bonds an exhaust molecule has, the more rotational and vibrational modes it will have. Consequently, it is generally desirable for the exhaust species to be as simple as possible, with a diatomic molecule composed of light, abundant atoms such as H2 being ideal in practical terms. However, in the case of a chemical rocket, hydrogen is a reactant and reducing agent, not a product. An oxidizing agent, most typically oxygen or an oxygen-rich species, must be introduced into the combustion process, adding mass and chemical bonds to the exhaust species.

An additional advantage of light molecules is that they may be accelerated to high velocity at temperatures that can be contained by currently available materials - the high gas temperatures in rocket engines pose serious problems for the engineering of survivable motors.

Liquid hydrogen (LH2) and oxygen (LOX, or LO2), are the most effective propellants in terms of exhaust velocity that have been widely used to date, though a few exotic combinations involving boron or liquid ozone are potentially somewhat better in theory if various practical problems could be solved.

When computing the specific reaction energy of a given propellant combination, the entire mass of the propellants (both fuel and oxidiser) must be included. The exception is in the case of air-breathing engines, which use atmospheric oxygen and consequently have to carry less mass for a given energy output. Fuels for car or turbojet engines have a much better effective energy output per unit mass of propellant that must be carried, but are similar per unit mass of fuel.

Computer programs that predict the performance of propellants in rocket engines are available.

==Ignition==

With liquid and hybrid rockets, immediate ignition of the propellants as they first enter the combustion chamber is essential.

With liquid propellants (but not gaseous), failure to ignite within milliseconds usually causes too much liquid propellant to be inside the chamber, and if/when ignition occurs the amount of hot gas created can exceed the maximum design pressure of the chamber, causing a catastrophic failure of the pressure vessel. This is sometimes called a &quot;hard start&quot; or a &quot;rapid unscheduled disassembly&quot; (RUD).

Ignition can be achieved by a number of different methods; a pyrotechnic charge can be used, a plasma torch can be used, or electric spark ignition may be employed. Some fuel/oxidiser combinations ignite on contact (hypergolic), and non-hypergolic fuels can be &quot;chemically ignited&quot; by priming the fuel lines with hypergolic propellants (popular in Russian engines).

Gaseous propellants generally will not cause hard starts, with rockets the total injector area is less than the throat thus the chamber pressure tends to ambient prior to ignition and high pressures cannot form even if the entire chamber is full of flammable gas at ignition.

Solid propellants are usually ignited with one-shot pyrotechnic devices and combustion usually proceeds through total consumption of the propellants.

Once ignited, rocket chambers are self-sustaining and igniters are not needed and combustion usually proceeds through total consumption of the propellants. Indeed, chambers often spontaneously reignite if they are restarted after being shut down for a few seconds. Unless designed for re-ignition, when cooled, many rockets cannot be restarted without at least minor maintenance, such as replacement of the pyrotechnic igniter or even refueling of the propellants.

==Jet physics==

Rocket jets vary depending on the rocket engine, design altitude, altitude, thrust and other factors.

Carbon-rich exhausts from kerosene-based fuels such as RP-1 are often orange in colour due to the black-body radiation of the unburnt particles, in addition to the blue Swan bands. Peroxide oxidiser-based rockets and hydrogen rocket jets contain largely steam and are nearly invisible to the naked eye but shine brightly in the ultraviolet and infrared ranges. Jets from solid-propellant rockets can be highly visible, as the propellant frequently contains metals such as elemental aluminium which burns with an orange-white flame and adds energy to the combustion process. Rocket engines which burn liquid hydrogen and oxygen will exhibit a nearly transparent exhaust, due to it being mostly superheated steam (water vapour), plus some unburned hydrogen.

The nozzle is usually over-expanded at sea level, and the exhaust can exhibit visible shock diamonds through a schlieren effect caused by the incandescence of the exhaust gas.

The shape of the jet varies for a fixed-area nozzle as the expansion ratio varies with altitude: at high altitude all rockets are grossly under-expanded, and a quite small percentage of exhaust gases actually end up expanding forwards.

==Types of rocket engines==

===Physically powered===
===Chemically powered===


===Electrically powered===

===Thermal===

====Preheated====
====Solar thermal====

The solar thermal rocket would make use of solar power to directly heat reaction mass, and therefore does not require an electrical generator as most other forms of solar-powered propulsion do. A solar thermal rocket only has to carry the means of capturing solar energy, such as concentrators and mirrors. The heated propellant is fed through a conventional rocket nozzle to produce thrust. The engine thrust is directly related to the surface area of the solar collector and to the local intensity of the solar radiation and inversely proportional to the &quot;I&quot;sp.

====Beamed thermal====

====Nuclear thermal====

===Nuclear===
Nuclear propulsion includes a wide variety of propulsion methods that use some form of nuclear reaction as their primary power source. Various types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them tested, for spacecraft applications:

==History of rocket engines==

According to the writings of the Roman Aulus Gellius, the earliest known example of jet propulsion was in c. 400 BC, when a Greek Pythagorean named Archytas, propelled a wooden bird along wires using steam. However, it was not powerful enough to take off under its own thrust.

The &quot;aeolipile&quot; described in the first century BC, often known as &quot;Hero&#x27;s engine&quot;, consisted of a pair of steam rocket nozzles mounted on a bearing. It was created almost two millennia before the Industrial Revolution but the principles behind it were not well understood, and it was not developed into a practical power source.

The availability of black powder to propel projectiles was a precursor to the development of the first solid rocket. Ninth Century Chinese Taoist alchemists discovered black powder in a search for the elixir of life; this accidental discovery led to fire arrows which were the first rocket engines to leave the ground.

It is stated that &quot;the reactive forces of incendiaries were probably not applied to the propulsion of projectiles prior to the 13th century&quot;. A turning point in rocket technology emerged with a short manuscript entitled &quot;Liber Ignium ad Comburendos Hostes&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;The Book of Fires&quot;). The manuscript is composed of recipes for creating incendiary weapons from the mid-eighth to the end of the thirteenth centuries—two of which are rockets. The first recipe calls for one part of colophonium and sulfur added to six parts of saltpeter (potassium nitrate) dissolved in laurel oil, then inserted into hollow wood and lit to &quot;fly away suddenly to whatever place you wish and burn up everything&quot;. The second recipe combines one pound of sulfur, two pounds of charcoal, and six pounds of saltpeter—all finely powdered on a marble slab. This powder mixture is packed firmly into a long and narrow case. The introduction of saltpeter into pyrotechnic mixtures connected the shift from hurled Greek fire into self-propelled rocketry.

Articles and books on the subject of rocketry appeared increasingly from the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. In the sixteenth century, German military engineer Conrad Haas (1509–1576) wrote a manuscript which introduced the construction of multi-staged rockets.

Rocket engines were also put in use by Tippu Sultan, the king of Mysore. These usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about long and diameter, closed at one end, packed with black powder propellant and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about long. A rocket carrying about one pound of powder could travel almost . These &#x27;rockets&#x27;, fitted with swords, would travel several meters in the air before coming down with sword edges facing the enemy. These were used very effectively against the British empire.

===Modern rocketry===
Slow development of this technology continued up to the later 19th century, when Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first wrote about liquid-fuelled rocket engines. He was the first to develop the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, though it was not published widely for some years.

The modern solid- and liquid-fuelled engines became realities early in the 20th century, thanks to the American physicist Robert Goddard. Goddard was the first to use a De Laval nozzle on a solid-propellant (gunpowder) rocket engine, doubling the thrust and increasing the efficiency by a factor of about twenty-five. This was the birth of the modern rocket engine. He calculated from his independently derived rocket equation that a reasonably sized rocket, using solid fuel, could place a one-pound payload on the Moon.

===The era of liquid-fuel rocket engines===
Goddard began to use liquid propellants in 1921, and in 1926 became the first to launch a liquid-fuelled rocket. Goddard pioneered the use of the De Laval nozzle, lightweight propellant tanks, small light turbopumps, thrust vectoring, the smoothly-throttled liquid fuel engine, regenerative cooling, and curtain cooling.

During the late 1930s, German scientists, such as Wernher von Braun and Hellmuth Walter, investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in military aircraft (Heinkel He 112, He 111, He 176 and Messerschmitt Me 163).

The turbopump was employed by German scientists in World War II. Until then cooling the nozzle had been problematic, and the A4 ballistic missile used dilute alcohol for the fuel, which reduced the combustion temperature sufficiently.

Staged combustion (&quot;Замкнутая схема&quot;) was first proposed by Alexey Isaev in 1949. The first staged combustion engine was the S1.5400 used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev. About the same time (1959), Nikolai Kuznetsov began work on the closed cycle engine NK-9 for Korolev&#x27;s orbital ICBM, GR-1. Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the NK-15 and NK-33 engines for the unsuccessful Lunar N1 rocket.

In the West, the first laboratory staged-combustion test engine was built in Germany in 1963, by Ludwig Boelkow.

Liquid hydrogen engines were first successfully developed in America: the RL-10 engine first flew in 1962. Its successor, the Rocketdyne J-2, was used in the Apollo program&#x27;s Saturn V rocket to send humans to the Moon. The high specific impulse and low density of liquid hydrogen lowered the upper stage mass and the overall size and cost of the vehicle.

The record for most engines on one rocket flight is 44, set by NASA in 2016 on a Black Brant.

<text>Roger Ascham (; 30 December 1568) was an English scholar and didactic writer, famous for his prose style, his promotion of the vernacular, and his theories of education. He served in the administrations of Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I, having earlier acted as Elizabeth&#x27;s tutor in Greek and Latin between 1548 and 1550.

==Early life==
Ascham was born at Kirby Wiske, a village in the North Riding of Yorkshire, near Northallerton, the third son of John Ascham, steward to Baron Scrope of Bolton. The name Ascham is derived from Askham near York. His mother, Margaret, is said to have come from the Conyers family, but this is speculation. Thomas and John were Roger&#x27;s two elder brothers, while Anthony Ascham was the youngest son of the Ascham family. The authority for this statement, as for most here concerning Ascham&#x27;s early life, is his close friend Edward Grant (1540s–1601), headmaster of the venerable and still extant Royal College of St. Peter at Westminster—better known as Westminster School—who collected and edited his letters and delivered a panegyrical oration on his life in 1576.

==Education==
Ascham was educated at the house of Sir Humphrey Wingfield, a barrister, Ascham tells us, in the &quot;Toxophilus&quot; under a tutor named R. Bond. His preferred sport was archery, and Sir Humphrey &quot;would at term times bring down from London both bows and shafts and go with them himself to see them shoot&quot;. Hence Ascham&#x27;s earliest English work, the &quot;Toxophilus&quot;, the importance which he attributed to archery in educational establishments, and probably the reason for archery in the statutes of St Albans, Harrow and other Elizabethan schools.

Through &quot;Toxophilus&quot;, Ascham sought to teach the art of shooting and present a literary piece with proper English vocabulary. He criticised other English authors for sprinkling foreign terms into their works. Prior to &quot;Toxophilus&quot;″ publication, the bow had been forgotten by the English people with firearms evolving as the prevailing weapons of choice. The book sparked renewed interest in the practice of archery and Ascham was able to present it as an &quot;innocent, salutary, useful, and liberal division&quot;. Many recognise the use of the bow as a disciplined skill, requiring more practice than any other instrument of offence.

From this private tuition Ascham was sent &quot;about 1530&quot;, at the age, it is said, of fifteen, to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, then the largest and most learned college in either university, where he devoted himself specially to the study of Greek, then newly revived. Equipped with a small knowledge of the Greek language, Ascham went on to read lectures and teach fellow St. John students the language. He believed that the best way to learn a language was by teaching it. Ascham was applauded for his encouragement of Greek learning in the University. In particular, Robert Pember, a fellow student, praised Ascham&#x27;s lectures and his method of teaching a language in order to learn it. In a letter to Ascham, Pember stated that &quot;he would gain more knowledge by explaining one of Aesop&#x27;s Fables to a boy, than by hearing one of Homer&#x27;s poems explained by another&quot;. Ascham was then appointed by the University to read Greek at open schools and received payment through honorary stipends. This was monumental for Ascham because at the time, there was no established lecturer of Greek at the University. Here he fell under the influence of Sir John Cheke, who was admitted a fellow in Ascham&#x27;s first year, and Sir Thomas Smith. Cheke in turn was friendly with Anthony Denny, who was brother-in-law to Kat Ashley, governess to the Lady Elizabeth. His guide and friend was Robert Pember, &quot;a man of the greatest learning and with an admirable ability in the Greek tongue&quot;.

He became B.A. in 1533–34, and was nominated to a fellowship at St John&#x27;s. Nicholas Metcalfe was then master of the college, &quot;a papist, indeed, and if any young man given to the new learning as they termed or went beyond his fellows&quot;, he &quot;lacked neither open praise, nor private exhibition&quot;. He procured Ascham&#x27;s election to a fellowship, &quot;though being a new bachelor of arts, I chanced among my companions to speak against the Pope ... after serious rebuke and some punishment, open warning was given to all the fellows, none to be so hardy, as to give me his voice at election.&quot; The day of election Ascham regarded as his birthday&quot;, and &quot;the whole foundation of the poor learning I have and of all the furtherance that hitherto elsewhere I have been tamed&quot;. He took his M.A. degree on 3 July 1537. 

He stayed for some time at Cambridge taking pupils, among whom was William Grindal, who in 1544 became tutor to Princess Elizabeth. Thomas Ashton, who was a foundational headmaster of Shrewsbury School, and an influential Tudor dramatist was in the St John&#x27;s College fellowship at the same time.

In 1540 he sent letters in both Greek and Latin to Edward Lee, the former adversary of Erasmus.

==Tutor to Elizabeth I==
In January 1548, Grindal, the tutor of princess Elizabeth, died. Ascham, one of the ablest Greek scholars in England, as well as public orator of the university, had already been in correspondence with the princess. In one of Ascham&#x27;s letters to Katherine Ashley, he enclosed a new pen, as well a pen which he himself mended specifically for princess Elizabeth. Through Cecil, and at the fourteen-year-old princess&#x27;s own wish, he was selected as her tutor against another candidate, also named Grindal, who was pressed by Admiral Seymour and Queen Catherine. In 1548, Ascham began teaching Elizabeth, future queen of England, in Greek and Latin chiefly at Cheshunt, a job he held until 1550.

On the subject of his experience with Elizabeth&#x27;s education, Ascham later wrote: &quot;Yea, I beleve, that beside her perfit readines, in Latin, Italian, French, &amp; Spanish, she readeth here now at Windsore more Greeke every day, than some Prebendarie of this Chirch doth read Latin in a whole weeke.&quot; Ascham&#x27;s influence on Elizabeth is suggested by the fact that, for the remainder of her life, she remained an occasional writer of poems, such as &quot;On Monsieur&#x27;s Departure&quot;.

In a letter to Johannes Sturm, the Strassburg schoolmaster, Ascham praised Elizabeth&#x27;s growth as a student: &quot;She talks French and Italian as well as English: she has often talked to me readily and well in Latin and moderately so in Greek. When she writes Greek and Latin nothing is more beautiful than her handwriting . . . she read with me almost all Cicero and great part of Titus Livius: for she drew all her knowledge of Latin from those two authors. She used to give the morning to the Greek Testament and afterwards read select orations of Isocrates and the tragedies of Sophocles. To these I added St. Cyprian and Melanchthon&#x27;s Commonplaces.&quot;

==Secretary to Richard Morrison==
In 1550, Ascham had an unspecified quarrel with the court, which he described only as &quot;a storm of recent violence and injury&quot;. As a result, Ascham returned to Cambridge. Whilst there, Cheke informed Ascham that he had been appointed secretary to Sir Richard Morrison (Moryson), appointed ambassador to Charles V. It was on his way to join Morrison that he paid visit to Lady Jane Grey at Bradgate, where he found her reading Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedo&quot; while everyone else was out hunting. This final meeting between the two has been a cause of inspiration among many painters and writers as a grandiose romantic moment.

Ascham served in this position for several years, travelling widely on the European continent. The embassy went to Louvain, where he found the university very inferior to Cambridge, then to Innsbruck and Venice. Ascham read Greek with the ambassador Morrison four or five days a week. His letters during the embassy in 1553, which was recalled on Mary&#x27;s accession, were later published as the &quot;Report and Discourse on Germany.&quot; The work, which was possibly a history of political turmoil in Germany in the 1550s, is incomplete. Common theories are that the work was either lost, damaged, or left unfinished.

==Latin Secretary to Mary I==
Ascham&#x27;s next job was an appointment as Latin Secretary to Mary I. Throughout the first few months he held the position, Ascham was bombarded with a torrent of work, which included countless letters. Through the efforts of Bishop Gardiner on his return to England, this office he likewise discharged to Queen Mary with a pension of £20 a year, and then to Elizabeth—a testimony to his tact and caution in those changeful times.

On 1 June 1554, he married Margaret Harleston, of South Ockendon, Essex, the daughter of Sir Clement Harleston. By her he had at least four sons and three daughters. 
Ascham was not a rich man, and when marrying Margaret, Ascham had to resign both his College Greek Readership and his University Public Oratorship. Margaret herself brought very little dowry, leaving Ascham to seek help from the connections he had made throughout the years. His relationship with Cardinal Reginald Pole led to Ascham&#x27;s securing from the queen the reversion of a lease of the manor of Salisbury Hall in Walthamstow, Essex, a manor once owned by Pole&#x27;s family.

==Death==
Ascham became fatally ill on 23 December 1568, having just finished a poem of thanks for the blessings Queen Elizabeth I had bestowed on England through her reign. Ascham made his last confession to the parish priest of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, William Gravet, simply saying &quot;I want to die and be with Christ&quot;, according to Edward Grant. He died on 30 December 1568, most likely from malaria. Ascham was then buried on 4 January 1569 in St. Sepulchre-without-Newgate, in London.

==Publications==
Ascham obtained from Edward Lee, then Archbishop of York, a pension of £2 a year, in return for which he translated Oecumenius&#x27; &quot;Commentaries on the Pauline Epistles&quot; but the archbishop, scenting heresy in some passage relating to the marriage of the clergy, sent it back to him.

===&quot;Toxophilus&quot;===
Ascham&#x27;s first published work, &quot;Toxophilus&quot; (&quot;Lover of the Bow&quot;) in 1545, was dedicated to Henry VIII. The objects of the book were twofold, to commend the practice of shooting with the long bow, and to set the example of a higher style of composition than had yet been attempted in English. Ascham presented the book to Henry VIII at Greenwich soon after his return from the capture of Boulogne, and received a grant of a pension of £10 a year. &quot;Toxophilus&quot; was the first book on archery in English. The work is a Platonic dialogue between Toxophilus and Philologus. Editions were published in 1571, 1589 and 1788, and by Edward Arber in 1868 and 1902.

===&quot;The Scholemaster&quot;===
In 1563 Ascham began the work &quot;The Scholemaster&quot;, published posthumously in 1570, which ensured his later reputation. Richard Sackville, he states in the book&#x27;s preface, told him that &quot;a fond schoolmaster&quot; had, by his brutality, made him hate learning, much to his loss, and as he had now a young son, whom he wished to be learned, he offered, if Ascham would name a tutor, to pay for the education of their respective sons under Ascham&#x27;s orders, and invited Ascham to write a treatise on &quot;the right order of teaching&quot;. &quot;The Scholemaster&quot; was the result.

Not a general treatise on educational method, the book concentrates on the teaching of Latin; and it was not intended for schools, but &quot;specially prepared for the private brynging up of youth in gentlemen and noblemens houses&quot;. It advocated &quot;the double translation of a model book&quot;, the book recommended being Sturmius&#x27;s &quot;Select Letters of Cicero&quot;; the method itself was not new. The book&#x27;s plea for gentleness and persuasion instead of coercion in schools, was contemporary: it was being practised and preached at that time by Christopher Jonson (–1597) at Winchester College; and had been repeatedly urged by Erasmus and others. Along with its suggestions for educational practice, Ascham&#x27;s book includes a famous warning against the dangers of Italy, which he calls &quot;inchantementes of Circes&quot;.

The &quot;Scholemaster&quot; was reprinted in 1571 and 1589. It was edited by James Upton in 1711 and in 1743, by John Eyton Bickersteth Mayor 1863, by Edward Arber in 1870 (reprints in 1888, 1895, 1903, 1910, 1927), by J. Holzamer (Vienna, 1881), and by Henry Morley in 1888 (Cassell&#x27;s National Library, no. 137; and reprints). In the twentieth century, it was included in series of English classics, in editions for use in schools: Methuen&#x27;s English Classics (1934, ed. D. C. Whimster), Dent University Paperbacks (1966, ed. R.J. Shoeck), Folger Shakespeare Library (1967, ed. L.V. Ryan).

===Correspondence===
Ascham&#x27;s letters were collected and published in 1576, and went through several editions, the last at Nuremberg in 1611. They were re-titled by William Elstob in 1703.

===Other works===
&quot;Report and Discourse of the Affairs and State of Germany 1553&quot; was published by John Daye (1570). Ascham&#x27;s English works were edited by James Bennett, with a life by Samuel Johnson in 1771, reprinted in 1815. John Allen Giles in 1864–1865 published in 4 vols. select letters from the &quot;Toxophilus&quot; and &quot;Scholemaster&quot; and the life by Edward Grant.

<text>Boyce Thompson Arboretum is the oldest and largest botanical garden in the state of Arizona. It is one of the oldest botanical institutions west of the Mississippi River. Founded in 1924 as a desert plant research facility and “living museum”, the arboretum is located in the Sonoran Desert on along Queen Creek and beneath the towering volcanic remnant, Picketpost Mountain. Boyce Thompson Arboretum is on U.S. Highway 60, an hour&#x27;s drive east from Phoenix and west of Superior, Arizona.

The arboretum has a visitor center, gift shop, research offices, greenhouses, a demonstration garden, picnic area, and a looping 1.5-mile (2.4 km) primary trail that leads visitors through various exhibits and natural areas. The exhibits include a cactus garden, palm and eucalyptus groves, an Australian exhibit, South American exhibit, aloe garden and an herb garden. There are also side trails such as the Chihuahuan Trail, Curandero Trail, and High Trail. 
Over 2600 species of arid land plants from around the world grow at the arboretum. Agaves, aloes, boojum trees, cork oaks, jujube trees, legume trees, and, in the eucalyptus grove, one of the largest red gum eucalyptus trees (&quot;Mr. Big&quot;) in the United States. Cacti and succulents grow extensively throughout the arboretum.

Because the arboretum is a riparian zone, the park attracts Sonoran Desert wildlife and migrating birds. Visitors have seen bobcats, javelinas, coatimundis, rattlesnakes, gila monsters, hawks, hummingbirds, and vultures. 270 bird species have been spotted in the park and the Audubon Society has designated the arboretum as an Important Bird Area.

 the arboretum had 5,000 members and attracted over 75,000 people annually.

==History==

The arboretum was founded by William Boyce Thompson (1869–1930), a mining engineer who made a fortune in the copper mining industry. He was the founder and first president of Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company at Globe-Miami, Arizona and Magma Copper Company in Superior, Arizona. In the early 1920s, Thompson, enamored with the landscape around Superior, built a winter home overlooking Queen Creek. Also in the 1920s, as his fortune grew, he created and financed the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Yonkers, New York (later at Cornell University), and the Boyce Thompson Arboretum on the property of the Picket Post House, west of Superior.

Boyce Thompson wrote: “I have in mind far more than mere botanical propagation. I hope to benefit the State and the Southwest by the addition of new products. A plant collection will be assembled which will be of interest not only to the nature lover and the plant student, but which will stress the practical side, as well to see if we cannot make these mesas, hillsides, and canyons far more productive and of more benefit to mankind. We will bring together and study the plants of the desert countries, find out their uses, and make them available to the people. It is a big job, but we will build here the most beautiful, and at the same time the most useful garden of its kind in the world.”
The Boyce Thompson Southwestern Arboretum was established on April 1, 1924, with the hiring of its first employees, Dr. Franklin Crider and Frederick Gibson, from the University of Arizona. Their first project was the construction of two homes that still exist on site, the Crider House and the Gibson House. Propagation buildings were put up in 1925 and by 1926, the Smith Building (administration building) and two connecting greenhouses were built. Ayer Lake was created the same year to help irrigate the lower portion of the park. In 1927, the Boyce Thompson Southwest Arboretum was incorporated, becoming the first non-profit research organization in Arizona. The Arboretum opened to the public on April 6, 1929.

===Arboretum administration board of directors===
In 1927, the Board of Directors consisted of Colonel Thompson, Charles F. Ayer (a business associate of the Colonel) and Edward Rice, an attorney from Globe. In 1929, the Directors of Boyce Thompson Institute and the Arboretum were added. Since that time, the Colonel&#x27;s family has served continuously on the Board and is 
represented by his great-great-grandson Dr. Paul Hohenlohe. His business associates have been represented by the son of another associate, William T. Smith, his son, Richard A. Smith and his son-in-law Ian Thompson. Between the three of them, they have held Chairmanship of the Board from 1963 to 2000 and since 2010. The President of the Boyce Thompson Institute has remained on the Board as well, represented by Dr. David Stern. Since 1976 with the signing of the Tri-Partite Agreement, two members from the University of Arizona and two members from Arizona State Parks also sit on the Board bringing the maximum number of board members to 20.

===Early years: 1924–1965===
With the hiring of Dr. Franklin Crider and Frederick Gibson on April 1, 1924, from the University of Arizona, the Arboretum was on its way. With the passage of Arizona House Bill 121 on March 7, 1925, it became possible for the Arboretum to incorporate as Arizona&#x27;s first non-profit research institution on October 5, 1927. Opening to the public in 1929, the future was indeed bright for the Arboretum. With the crash of 1929, subsequent depression, a drought, and the passing of the Colonel in 1930, the Arboretum began to struggle. Dr. Crider left as managing director in 1934 and was succeeded by Frederick Gibson. The Picket Post House was sold in 1946 to help cut costs and raise revenues for the Arboretum. Frederick Gibson stayed as Director until his death in 1953. The Colonel&#x27;s nephew, Joe E. Thompson Jr., became the managing director until the agreement with the University of Arizona in 1965.

===Desert Biology Station and University of Arizona: 1965–1976===
A cooperative agreement was made with the University of Arizona in 1965, and Dr. E. Lendell Cockrum became the 4th Managing Director of the Arboretum. The intent was to reinvigorate the research program at the Arboretum and it was renamed the Desert Biology Station. In addition, Drs. Frank and Carol Crosswhite were added to the staff as Curators of Botany and Zoology. Dr. Cockrum left the Arboretum in 1968 and was replaced by Dr. Vernon Grant. Dr. Grant was succeeded in 1970 by Dr. Robert T. McKittrick who served as the 6th Director until 1984. Dr. McKittrick and Drs. Frank and Carol Crosswhite who retired in 2002 became the bridge between this and the next phase of the Arboretum&#x27;s development.

===Tri-Partite Agreement and state park: since 1976===

With the signing of the Tri-Partite Agreement on March 30, 1976, the Arboretum became a state park, but remained a scientific research facility and a non-profit institution. The Arboretum was listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same year. The Arboretum began publishing the journal &quot;Desert Plants&quot; in 1979. Dr. McKittrick, who had brought stability to the Arboretum though two transitions, retired in 1984. His replacement, Dr. William Feldman, was to serve for 21 years, the 3rd longest serving director after Frederick Gibson and Robert McKittrick. Under Dr. Feldman, the Arboretum matured. The Visitor Center, Demonstration Garden, and Legume Garden were completed under his tenure as was the planning for the Children&#x27;s Garden. Exhibits became more geographically focused and the word “conservation” was added to the mission statement. The Demonstration Garden was developed by Dr. Warren Jones from the University of Arizona and Steve Carter from the Arboretum. The Children&#x27;s Garden was left for Dr. Mark Bierner to realize during his tenure from 2005 to 2008. In addition, the Picket Post House was purchased by Arizona State Parks in 2008 making the Arboretum whole again.

An example of the Tri-Partite partnership is the University of Arizona/BTA&#x27;s Desert Legume Program or DELEP. DELEP is one of three U.S. organizations to have its seed bank backed up at the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway and one of three private organizations backed up at the National Center for Plant Genetic Resources in Fort Collins, Colorado. Another example is the Arizona State Parks’ Volunteer program which has allowed the Arboretum to expand its educational and recreational programming.

== Plant Collections ==
The arboretum holds collections of plants from the deserts of the United States, Mexico, Australia, Madagascar, India, China, Japan, Israel, South America, the Middle East, Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Arabian Peninsula. Among these are three nationally accredited plant collections: eucalyptus trees, desert legumes, and southwest oaks.

=== Eucalyptus Collection ===
The eucalyptus collection was accredited in 2018. At 93 taxa, it is one of the largest collections in the U.S. and features many trees planted in the 1920s, including &quot;Mr.Big,&quot; a Champion Tree.

=== Desert Legume Collection ===
The arboretum&#x27;s desert legume collection is the first primarily seed-based collection accredited by Plant Collections Network. The internationally recognized seed bank of 1,413 species are housed at the University of Arizona in Tucson, while 121 species are grown in field plantings and the Taylor Family Desert Legume Garden at the arboretum.

=== Oak Collection ===
In 2012, the arboretum gained accreditation of its collection of oak trees, as well as joining the Plant Collection Network&#x27;s Quercus Multisite Collection. The Boyce Thompson Arboretum&#x27;s collection includes oak trees sourced from Arizona, New Mexico, and west Texas in the United States, and Sonora, Chihuahua, and Coahuila in Mexico.

=== Other Plant Collections of Note ===
The Australia collection, one of the largest in the United States, contains 39 families, 93 genera, and 321 species of plant. This collection is as old as the arboretum, with the first accessions wild-collected on Australian expeditions and dating back to the early 1920s. Key genera represented include eucalyptus (103 species), acacia (37 species) and melaleuca (15 species).

The ephedra collection is one of the largest collections of New World Ephedra in the world, with 11 of the 12 North American species represented at the arboretum. There are currently 28 taxa, with 69 individual plants/

The aloe collection holds almost half the world&#x27;s known aloes at 217 species and 817 total plants. Highlight plants in the collection include &quot;Aloe helenae,&quot; which is an endangered aloe native to Madagascar, as well as Big John, a large unusually colored aloe hybrid in the Wallace collection.

The dudleya collection has recently begun expanding, with 10 species and 24 individual plants currently. Four of these species are listed as vulnerable or locally endanged, as the dudleya are threatened due to habitat loss and poaching.

<doc id="262144" wikidata="Q677161" url="?curid=262144" title="GAP (computer algebra system)">
<text>GAP (Groups, Algorithms and Programming) is an open source computer algebra system for computational discrete algebra with particular emphasis on computational group theory.

==History==
GAP was developed at Lehrstuhl D für Mathematik (LDFM), Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Germany from 1986 to 1997. After the retirement of Joachim Neubüser from the chair of LDFM, the development and maintenance of GAP was coordinated by the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. In the summer of 2005 coordination was transferred to an equal partnership of four &#x27;GAP Centres&#x27;, located at the University of St Andrews, RWTH Aachen, Technische Universität Braunschweig, and Colorado State University at Fort Collins; in April 2020, a fifth GAP Centre located at the TU Kaiserslautern was added.

==Features==
GAP contains a procedural programming language and a large collection of functions to create and manipulate various mathematical objects. It supports integers and rational numbers of arbitrary size, memory permitting. Finite groups can be defined as groups of permutations and it is also possible to define finitely presented groups by specifying generators and relations. Several databases of important finite groups are included. GAP also allows to work with matrices and with finite fields (which are represented using Conway polynomials). Rings, modules and Lie algebras are also supported.

==Distribution==
GAP and its sources, including packages (sets of user contributed programs), data library (including a list of small groups) and the manual, are distributed freely, subject to &quot;copyleft&quot; conditions. GAP runs on any Unix system, under Windows, and on Macintosh systems. The standard distribution requires about 300 MB (about 400 MB if all the packages are loaded).

The user contributed packages are an important feature of the system, adding a great deal of functionality. GAP offers package authors the opportunity to submit these packages for a process of peer review, hopefully improving the quality of the final packages, and providing recognition akin to an academic publication for their authors. , there are 151 packages distributed with GAP, of which approximately 71 have been through this process.

An interface is available for using the SINGULAR computer algebra system from within GAP. GAP is also included in the mathematical software system SageMath.

<text>The phrase &quot;Middle England&quot; is a socio-political term which generally refers to middle class or lower-middle class people in England who hold traditional conservative or right-wing views.

==Origins==
The origins of the term &quot;Middle England&quot; are not known. Writer Ian Hislop found evidence of the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury&#x27;s using the term in 1882, but it did not gain popularity at the time. Modern popular usage of the phrase has been attributed to Margaret Thatcher who, according to the historian David Cannadine, introduced the expression into political phraseology by adopting Richard Nixon&#x27;s concept of &quot;Middle America&quot;. However, Joe Moran found that, although the concept originated in Thatcherism, the term itself was rarely used by Thatcher, or by national newspapers until the 1990s premiership of John Major.

==Modern usage==

The primary meaning of the term is now a political or sociological one (as is also the case for the term &quot;Middle America&quot; or &quot;Middle Australia&quot;). It principally indicates the middle classes or lower-middle classes of non-urban Britain, but also carries connotations of &quot;Deep England&quot;. John Major&#x27;s 1993 speech to the Conservative Group for Europe is often cited, evoking romantic imagery of rural cricket matches, warm beer, suburban gardens, and &quot;old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist&quot; (itself based on a quote from George Orwell).

Although Middle England does not refer to a geographical region, it may be understood to refer to the inhabitants of suburbs in the South of England and the Midlands, typified by the small towns that make up &quot;Metro-Land&quot;, the suburban areas north-west of London that are served by London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line. The BBC described the Kent town of Tunbridge Wells as the &quot;spiritual home&quot; of Middle England, with particular reference to the popular characterisation of &quot;Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells&quot;, the pseudonym of an imaginary, incensed letter-writer. Emphasising its lack of geographical location, the writer Nick Inman likened Middle England to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth: &quot;We know everything about it except where it is&quot;.

The term is used by journalists to refer to the presumed views of mainstream English and to a lesser extent British people, as opposed to minorities of all types (the rich or the poor, ethnic minorities, gays, lesbians and bisexuals, the politically active, the intelligentsia, etc.). In particular, it is increasingly used to denote the more right-wing views of those who are not in such minorities. The phrase &quot;Middle England&quot; may be regarded by some as interchangeable with &quot;Middle Britain&quot;, particularly with reference to political campaigns that seek to include middle-class voters in Scotland and Wales, but commentators such as Cannadine have assessed it as a designation specific to a segment of England, not Britain as a whole. John Major&#x27;s 1993 speech has been noted for its culturally selective evocation of Britain, omitting inner cities, football, people who are unemployed, coal mines, Muslims, and the other Constituent Countries of the United Kingdom.

People who belong to the Middle England grouping are typically said to be white, middle class or lower-middle class, heterosexual, with a strong work ethic and a highly developed sense of conscientiousness. They may typically read the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, a popular British newspaper known for its conservative editorial bias, and are also sometimes referred to as the &quot;silent majority&quot; or &quot;moral majority&quot; in the British media.

==In politics==
In British politics, Middle England is considered as a grouping to be especially important because of its potential to swing the results of United Kingdom general elections; according to the polling company MORI, Middle England is said to make up 25% of the UK population, its members are not devoted to any particular party and may be swayed by successful political campaigning, and many live in marginal constituencies. Middle England was also considered to be a major force in the vote to leave the European Union during the 2016 European Union membership referendum.

==Other institutions==
Members of the Countryside Alliance may be considered to be typical of Middle England, while members of the Women&#x27;s Institute have been described as &quot;the backbone of Middle England&quot;.

==Related terms==
Other demographic personas associated with Middle England include &quot;Mondeo Man&quot; (a term attributed to Tony Blair which describes a middle-class floating voter who owns a Ford Mondeo); &quot;Worcester woman&quot; (a provincial voter with little actual political awareness); &quot;Essex Man&quot; (an aspirational lower-middle-class voter from Essex); and &quot;Pebbledash people&quot; (a term coined by ICM Research to describe married white collar couples who live in semi-detached houses covered in pebbledash).

<doc id="262147" wikidata="Q1245756" url="?curid=262147" title="William Paget, 1st Baron Paget">
<text>William Paget, 1st Baron Paget of Beaudesert (15069 June 1563), was an English and accountant who held prominent positions in the service of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I. He was the patriarch of the Paget family, whose descendants were created Earl of Uxbridge (1714) and Marquess of Anglesey (1815).

==Early life and education==
William Paget was born around 1506 in humble circumstances, but little is confirmed about his origin. A family named Paget was recorded as nail makers in Wednesbury, Staffordshire, during the Tudor period. His father has been variously described as a sheep shearer, barber, clothworker, constable, or nail smithy.

According to Sir William Dugdale, he was the son of John Pachett or Paget, one of the serjeants-at-mace of the city of London. According to Staffordshire historian Frederick Hackwood, he was born in Wednesbury and taken to London by his father when he was very young. 

Paget must have been extremely bright, as he was accepted as a pupil at St Paul&#x27;s School when William Lily was its headmaster. At St Paul&#x27;s, he befriended the future antiquary John Leland and later acted as one of his benefactors, and became close friends with Sir Thomas Wriothesley and Sir Anthony Denny. He then went up to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he studied civil law, proceeding afterwards to the University of Paris. At Cambridge, he was taken under the wing of Stephen Gardiner, Master at Trinity Hall, who became his patron.

==Political career==
Paget served as Member of Parliament for Lichfield in 1529 and for Middlesex in 1545.

Probably through the influence of Stephen Gardiner, he was employed by King Henry VIII in several important diplomatic missions; in 1532 he was appointed Clerk of the Signet and soon afterwards of the privy council. He became secretary to Anne of Cleves in 1539 and was appointed Clerk of the Parliaments on 15 July 1541, although it seems likely that he never discharged the duties of this office in person, but rather through others. In April 1543 he was sworn of the privy council and appointed secretary of state, in which position Henry VIII relied on his advice, at last appointing him one of the council to act during the minority of King Edward VI.

Paget at first vigorously supported the protector Somerset, while counselling a moderation which Somerset did not always observe. Paget would go on to become increasingly alienated from the Duke, reaching out to him in a series of letters from February 1548 in which he tried to persuade Somerset to take others&#x27; opinions into consideration. He blamed Somerset&#x27;s dictatorial style and foolish attempts to help the poor for the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549. In 1547 he was made controller of the king&#x27;s household, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, elected knight of the shire (MP) for Staffordshire and made a knight of the Garter; and in 1549 he was summoned by writ to the House of Lords as Baron Paget de Beaudesert (at which point he ceased to be the Clerk of the Parliaments). About the same time he obtained extensive grants of lands, including Cannock Chase and Burton Abbey in Staffordshire, in London the residence of the bishops of Exeter, afterwards known successively as Lincoln House and Essex House, on the site now occupied by the Outer Temple in the London, and also in 1547 he was granted the lordship and manor of Harmondsworth. He obtained Beaudesert in Staffordshire, which remained the chief seat of the Paget family.

Paget shared Somerset&#x27;s disgrace, being committed to the Tower in 1551 and degraded from the Order of the Garter in the following year, besides suffering a heavy fine by the Star Chamber for having profited at the expense of the Crown in his administration of the duchy of Lancaster. He was, however, restored to the king&#x27;s favour in 1553, and was one of the twenty-six peers who signed Edward&#x27;s settlement of the crown on Lady Jane Grey in June of that year. He made his peace with Queen Mary I, who reinstated him as a knight of the Garter and in the privy council in 1553, and appointed him Lord Privy Seal in 1556. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558, Paget retired from public life.

==Marriage and issue==

In 1530, Paget married Anne, allegedly daughter of Henry Preston, grandson of Thomas Preston of Preston, Lancashire, and Nether Levens Hall, Westmorland. They four sons and six daughters.

*Henry, 2nd Baron Paget (c.1539 – 28 December 1568), succeeded his father to the peerage
*Thomas, 3rd Baron Paget (c.1540–1589), succeeded elder brother to the peerage
*Charles, well-known Catholic conspirator during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I; his brother Thomas was suspected of complicity in Charles&#x27;s plots and was attainted in 1587
*Edward (died young)
*Etheldreda, married Sir Christopher Allen of Ightham Mote, Kent 
*Eleanor, married firstly, Jerome Palmer, Esq., and secondly, Sir Rowland Clarke
*Grisold (or Grizelda), married firstly, Sir Thomas Rivett, and secondly, Sir William Waldegrave
*Joane (or Jane), married Sir Thomas Kitson
*Dorothy, married Sir Thomas Willoughby (died 1559)
*Anne (died 1590), married Sir Henry Lee

The 7th Baron Paget was created Baron Burton in 1712 and Earl of Uxbridge in 1714.

<text>William John Macquorn Rankine (; 5 July 1820 – 24 December 1872) was a Scottish mathematician and physicist. He was a founding contributor, with Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), to the science of thermodynamics, particularly focusing on its First Law. He developed the Rankine scale, a Fahrenheit-based equivalent to the Celsius-based Kelvin scale of temperature.

Rankine developed a complete theory of the steam engine and indeed of all heat engines. His manuals of engineering science and practice were used for many decades after their publication in the 1850s and 1860s. He published several hundred papers and notes on science and engineering topics, from 1840 onwards, and his interests were extremely varied, including, in his youth, botany, music theory and number theory, and, in his mature years, most major branches of science, mathematics and engineering.

He was also a singer, pianist and cellist as well as a rifleman.

==Life==
Rankine was born in Edinburgh to Lt David Rankin (sic), a civil engineer from a military background, who later worked on the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway (locally known as the Innocent Railway). His mother was Barbara Grahame, of a prominent legal and banking family.

His father moved around Scotland on various projects and the family moved with him. William was initially educated at home, due to his poor health, but he later attended Ayr Academy (1828–29) and then the High School of Glasgow (1830). Around 1830 the family moved to Edinburgh when the father got a post as Manager of the Edinburgh to Dalkeith Railway. The family then lived at 2 Arniston Place.

In 1834 he was sent to the Scottish Naval and Military Academy on Lothian Road in Edinburgh with the mathematician George Lee. By that year William was already highly proficient in mathematics and received, as a gift from his uncle, Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; (1687) in the original Latin.

In 1836, Rankine began to study a spectrum of scientific topics at the University of Edinburgh, including natural history under Robert Jameson and natural philosophy under James David Forbes. Under Forbes he was awarded prizes for essays on methods of physical inquiry and on the undulatory (or wave) theory of light. During vacations, he assisted his father who, from 1830, was manager and, later, effective treasurer and engineer of the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway which brought coal into the growing city. He left the University of Edinburgh in 1838 without a degree (which was not then unusual) and, perhaps because of straitened family finances, became an apprentice to Sir John Benjamin Macneill, who was at the time surveyor to the Irish Railway Commission. During his pupilage he developed a technique, later known as Rankine&#x27;s method, for laying out railway curves, fully exploiting the theodolite and making a substantial improvement in accuracy and productivity over existing methods. In fact, the technique was simultaneously in use by other engineers – and in the 1860s there was a minor dispute about Rankine&#x27;s priority.

The year 1842 also marked Rankine&#x27;s first attempt to reduce the phenomena of heat to a mathematical form but he was frustrated by his lack of experimental data. At the time of Queen Victoria&#x27;s visit to Scotland, later that year, he organised a large bonfire situated on Arthur&#x27;s Seat, constructed with radiating air passages under the fuel. The bonfire served as a beacon to initiate a chain of other bonfires across Scotland.

In 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Prof James David Forbes. He won the Society&#x27;s Keith Prize for the period 1851–53. He served as the Society&#x27;s Vice President from 1871 to 1872.

From 1855 he was Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics at Glasgow University.

He died at 8 Albion Crescent (now called Dowanside Road), Dowanhill, Glasgow at 11:45pm on Christmas Eve, 24 December 1872, aged only 52. He was unmarried and had no children. His death was registered by his uncle, Alex Grahame (his late mother&#x27;s brother in law).

==Thermodynamics==
Undaunted, Rankine returned to his youthful fascination with the mechanics of the heat engine. Though his theory of circulating streams of elastic vortices whose volumes spontaneously adapted to their environment sounds fanciful to scientists formed on a modern account, by 1849, he had succeeded in finding the relationship between saturated vapour pressure and temperature. The following year, he used his theory to establish relationships between the temperature, pressure and density of gases, and expressions for the latent heat of evaporation of a liquid. He accurately predicted the surprising fact that the apparent specific heat of saturated steam would be negative.

Emboldened by his success, in 1851 he set out to calculate the efficiency of heat engines and used his theory as a basis to deduce the principle, that the maximum efficiency possible for any heat engine is a function only of the two temperatures between which it operates. Though a similar result had already been derived by Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson, Rankine claimed that his result rested upon his hypothesis of molecular vortices alone, rather than upon Carnot&#x27;s theory or some other additional assumption. The work marked the first step on Rankine&#x27;s journey to develop a more complete theory of heat. In 1853, he coined the term potential energy.

Rankine later recast the results of his molecular theories in terms of a macroscopic account of energy and its transformations. He defined and distinguished between &quot;actual energy&quot; which was lost in dynamic processes and &quot;potential energy&quot; by which it was replaced. He assumed the sum of the two energies to be constant, an idea already, although surely not for very long, familiar in the law of conservation of energy. From 1854, he made wide use of his &quot;thermodynamic function&quot; which he later realised was identical to the entropy of Clausius. By 1855, Rankine had formulated a &quot;science of energetics&quot; which gave an account of dynamics in terms of energy and its transformations rather than force and motion. This article presents the first published definition of energy in terms of capacity for performing work, which quickly became the standard general definition of energy. The theory was very influential in the 1890s. In 1859 he proposed the Rankine scale of temperature, an absolute or thermodynamic scale whose degree is equal to a Fahrenheit degree. In 1862, Rankine expanded Lord Kelvin’s theory of universal heat death and, along with Kelvin himself, formulated the heat death paradox, which disproves the possibility of an infinitely old universe.

Energetics offered Rankine an alternative, and rather more mainstream, approach, to his science and, from the mid-1850s, he made rather less use of his molecular vortices. Yet he still claimed that Maxwell&#x27;s work on electromagnetics was effectively an extension of his model. And, in 1864, he contended that the microscopic theories of heat proposed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell, based on linear atomic motion, were inadequate. It was only in 1869 that Rankine admitted the success of these rival theories. By that time, his own model of the atom had become almost identical with that of Thomson.

As was his constant aim, especially as a teacher of engineering, he used his own theories to develop a number of practical results and to elucidate their physical principles including:

*The Rankine–Hugoniot equation for propagation of shock waves, governs the behaviour of shock waves normal to the oncoming flow. It is named after physicists Rankine and the French engineer Pierre Henri Hugoniot;
*The Rankine cycle, an analysis of an ideal heat-engine with a condensor. Like other thermodynamic cycles, the maximum efficiency of the Rankine cycle is given by calculating the maximum efficiency of the Carnot cycle;
*Properties of steam, gases and vapours.

The history of rotordynamics is replete with the interplay of theory and practice. Rankine first performed an analysis of a spinning shaft in 1869, but his model was not adequate and he predicted that supercritical speeds could not be attained.

==Fatigue studies==
Rankine was one of the first engineers to recognise that fatigue failures of railway axles was caused by the initiation and growth of brittle cracks. In the early 1840s he examined many broken axles, especially after the Versailles train crash of 1842 when a locomotive axle suddenly fractured and led to the death of over 50 passengers. He showed that the axles had failed by progressive growth of a brittle crack from a shoulder or other stress concentration source on the shaft, such as a keyway. He was supported by similar direct analysis of failed axles by Joseph Glynn, where the axles failed by slow growth of a brittle crack in a process now known as metal fatigue. It was likely that the front axle of one of the locomotives involved in the Versailles train crash failed in a similar way. Rankine presented his conclusions in a paper delivered to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His work was ignored however, by many engineers who persisted in believing that stress could cause &quot;re-crystallisation&quot; of the metal, a myth which has persisted even to recent times. The theory of recrystallisation was quite wrong, and inhibited worthwhile research until the work of William Fairbairn a few years later, which showed the weakening effect of repeated flexure on large beams. Nevertheless, fatigue remained a serious and poorly understood phenomenon, and was the root cause of many accidents on the railways and elsewhere. It is still a serious problem, but at least is much better understood today, and so can be prevented by careful design.

==Other work==

Rankine served as Regius Professor of Civil Engineering and Mechanics at the University of Glasgow from November 1855 until his death in December 1872, pursuing engineering research along a number of lines in civil and mechanical engineering.

Rankine was instrumental in the formation of the forerunner of Glasgow University Officer Training Corps, the 2nd Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps at Glasgow University in July 1859, becoming Major in 1860 after it was formed into the first company of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps; he served until 1864, when he resigned due to pressure of work – much of it associated with Naval Architecture.

===Civil engineering===
The Rankine Lectures, organised by the British Geotechnical Association, are named in recognition of the significant contributions Rankine made to:
*Forces in frame structures;
*Soil mechanics; most notably in lateral earth pressure theory and the stabilization of retaining walls. The Rankine method of earth pressure analysis is named after him.

===Naval architecture===
Rankine worked closely with Clyde shipbuilders, especially his friend and lifelong collaborator James Robert Napier, to make naval architecture into an engineering science. He was a founding member, and first President of the Institution of Engineers &amp; Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1857. He was an early member of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects (founded 1860) and attended many of its annual meetings. With William Thomson and others, Rankine was a member of the board of enquiry into the controversial sinking of HMS &quot;Captain&quot;.

<text>Andrews Air Force Base (Andrews AFB, AAFB) is the airfield portion of Joint Base Andrews, which is under the jurisdiction of the United States Air Force (USAF). In 2009, Andrews Air Force Base merged with Naval Air Facility Washington to form Joint Base Andrews. Andrews, located near Morningside, Maryland in suburban Washington, D.C., is the home base of two Boeing VC-25A aircraft with the call sign Air Force One when the president is on board, that serve the President of the United States, and the President is typically flown in and out of Andrews when travelling from Washington, D.C. by plane.

The host unit at Andrews is the 316th Wing, assigned to the Air Force District of Washington. It is responsible for maintaining emergency reaction rotary-wing airlift and other National Capital Region contingency response capabilities critical to national security and for organizing, training, equipping and deploying combat-ready forces for Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEFs). The 316th Wing also provides installation security, services and airfield management to support the President, Vice President, other U.S. senior leaders and more than 50 tenant organizations and federal agencies.

The 316th Wing provides security, personnel, contracting, finance and infrastructure support for five wings, three headquarters, more than 80 tenant organizations, 148 geographically separated units, and 6,500 airmen in the Pentagon, as well as 60,000 airmen and families in the national capital region and around the world. The 316th Wing supports contingency operations in the capital of the United States with immediate response rotary-assets. It also provides security for the world&#x27;s highest visibility flight line and is responsible for ceremonial support with the United States Air Force Band, Honor Guard and Air Force Arlington Chaplaincy.

The wing commander is Colonel Tyler R. Schaff, and the command chief master sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Thomas C. Daniels.

==History==
Union American Civil War troops used a country church near Camp Springs, Maryland for sleeping quarters (now named Chapel Two) and on 25 August 1941, President Roosevelt directed use of the land for an airfield.

===Camp Springs Air Base===
Camp Springs Air Base was designated on 5 September 1942, and construction began on 16 September 1942. The Maryland World War II Army Airfield of the 1st Air Force was &quot;designated a sub-base of Headquarters, Baltimore AAFld, late Nov 1942&quot;—the 901st Quartermaster Company (Construction) became the base operating unit on 14 December 1942. Camp Springs Army Air Base opened on 2 May 1943, and the airfield became operational 2 May 1943 when the first Republic P-47 Thunderbolts arrived. after the 367th Fighter Squadron was stationed at Camp Springs on 21 April 1943. On 6 June 1943 the Camp Springs headquarters gained command of 4 sub-bases: Baltimore AAFld, Dover Army Airfield, Millville Army Airfield, and Philadelphia Municipal Airport became sub-bases of Camp Springs AAB.

The airfield had runways by 1944 when the 90th Fighter Control Squadron was formed (28 March 1944), and the last Camp Springs combat units (e.g., 535th Fighter Escort Squadron) departed for World War II combat on 10 April 1944. Camp Springs was expanded to become the initial headquarters of Continental Air Forces (CONAF) (activated 12 December 1944)—the 161st AAF Base Unit (CONAF) became the &quot;Andrews Field&quot; operating unit on 16 April 1945.

===Andrews Field===
Andrews Field was named on 7 February 1945 in honor of Lt Gen. Frank Andrews and in 1946, Andrews was a sub-base of Bolling Field (3 January 1946 – 20 November 1946). Strategic Air Command headquarters transferred from Bolling Field to Andrews. The command of CONAF&#x27;s Radar Bomb Scoring detachments (e.g., at Dallas Love Field) transferred to Andrews on 17 March 1946 when the &quot;263 AAF BU&quot; was assigned (transferred 23 February 1948) to Carswell AFB.

Andrews was transferred from the Army to the Air Force in 1947, and it was a Headquarters Command installation from 1947 through 1952 and again after 1957. Headquarters Military Air Transport Service controlled the base during the interim period. The year 1947 marked the arrival of the first permanently assigned jet-powered aircraft, the F-80 Shooting Star, at Andrews. The long-lived and versatile training version of the F-80, the T-33, still played an important role in proficiency flying programs at Andrews more than 30 years later.

===Andrews Air Force Base===

Andrews Air Force Base was designated on 24 June 1948, and in June 1950, Andrews rapidly became involved in combat readiness training for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber crews. Combat readiness training and proficiency flying for military pilots assigned non-flying duties in the Washington area have remained two key elements in the local mission since the establishment of the base. HQ Air Research and Development Command (later, Air Force Systems Command) moved to Andrews from Baltimore, 24 June 1958. With the construction of new facilities beginning in 1959, Andrews had become by early 1962 the primary USAF flight installation serving the Washington, DC, area with the closing of the runway at Bolling AFB.

Andrews&#x27; air defense role was strengthened in the 1950s with the latest in fighter-interceptor hardware appearing on the flight line. F-94 Starfires, F-102 Delta Daggers and finally, F-106 Delta Darts formed the backbone of the three fighter interceptor squadrons which operated from the base until 1963.

In the late 1950s Andrews began an annual open house and air show on base. This event later evolved into the Department of Defense Joint Services Open House, an annual event that now brings more than 700,000 visitors to the base every year. The open house is held every year over Armed Forces Day weekend.

In the years since 1959, Andrews&#x27; flight operations and importance have increased greatly. In 1961, the last of the Military Air Transport Service&#x27;s flying units at Washington National Airport transferred to Andrews. This was followed a year later by the transfer to Andrews of all fixed-wing flying activities from Bolling Air Force Base. Andrews has become firmly established as the main port of entry for foreign military and government officials en route to Washington and the United States. In July 1961, the official presidential aircraft was stationed here, known as &quot;Air Force One&quot; when the president is on board. Before 1961, the presidential airplane had been kept at Washington National Airport and Bolling AFB.

In 1963, the Naval Air Facility (NAF), originally established at the former NAS Anacostia in 1919, moved to Andrews. The NAF handles Naval VIP flight operations. The Marine Corps detachment that flies the FA-18 Hornet is located here.

In a major reorganization, Headquarters Command, U.S. Air Force, was disbanded 1 July 1976, restructured under the Military Airlift Command as the 76th Airlift Division and transferred its headquarters from Bolling AFB to Andrews. The 76th remained the parent unit of the Andrews host command, redesignated as the 1st Air Base Wing.

In October 1977, the 76th Airlift Division became the 76th Military Airlift Wing. The 1st Air Base Wing was redesignated the 76th Air Base Group, and the 89th Military Airlift Wing became the 89th Military Airlift Group. The 76th MAW remained the parent unit at Andrews. On 15 December 1980, the 76th Airlift Division was reestablished, the 76th Air Base Group became the 1776th Air Base Wing and the 89th Military Airlift Group became the 89th Military Airlift Wing. On 1 October 1985, the 76th Airlift Division was inactivated as the result of activation of the Headquarters Air Force District of Washington at Bolling AFB. The 1776th Air Base Wing was designated the &quot;host wing&quot; for Andrews AFB and assumed base support responsibilities.

During Operation Desert Storm, Andrews handled 16,540 patients in makeshift hospital facilities located in the base tennis center.
On 12 July 1991, the 89th Military Airlift Wing was redesignated as the 89th Airlift Wing and assumed duties as the host wing at Andrews AFB. Support functions previously performed by the 1776th Air Base Wing now fall under the 89th and the 1776th was inactivated. With the consolidation of the two wings, the newly formed 89th Airlift Wing is one of the largest wings in Air Mobility Command with a work force approaching 9,000 people.

Known as &quot;The President&#x27;s Wing,&quot; the 89th Airlift Wing continues to contribute to Andrews&#x27; rich history as the elite Air Mobility Command wing for transporting VIPs around the world. Not only does Andrews provide service for America&#x27;s senior officials, but also kings, queens, presidents, prime ministers, popes, and local and foreign military leaders make Andrews AFB their first stop in the United States.

On 5 January 2005 the Air Force reactivated the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) as the single Air Force voice for planning and implementing Air Force and joint solutions within the National Capital Region (NCR). This event brought with it significant changes at Andrews. On 12 May 2006, the 89th Medical Group at Andrews and the 11th Medical Group, Bolling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C. combined into the 79th Medical Wing where it established its headquarters at Andrews. In June 2006, the 316th Wing stood up under the command of AFDW as the new host unit for Andrews Air Force Base and its nearly 50 tenant units to include organizations from the U.S. Army, the Air Force Reserve Command, Air National Guard, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve and the Civil Air Patrol. The activation of the 316th prompted the transfer of the 1st Helicopter Squadron from the 89th Airlift Wing to the 316th Operations Group. In May 2007 the AFDW, as well as the 844th Communications Group, transferred from Bolling AFB to Andrews AFB.

===Merger===
In May 2005, several recommendations relating to Andrews AFB were made by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. The most significant was to realign Naval Air Facility (NAF) Washington, by relocating its installation management functions to Andrews AFB, thereby establishing Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington.

BRAC also recommended relocating several offices of the Secretary of the Air Force to Andrews from leased office space in Arlington, Virginia, thereby reducing reliance on leased floor space and increasing the security for those activities by locating them within a military installation.

Other changes included the relocation of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) headquarters from Andrews to Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, and the relocation of the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) and its two C-21A to Will Rogers Air National Guard Base, Oklahoma.

The merger with NAF Washington was effective from 1 October 2009, when the joint base was established, with the US Air Force being the lead organization providing management and support services for both installations.

Although sharing parallel runways, NAF Washington was originally considered a separate air installation and maintained a separate Navy/Marine Corps–unique FAA airfield identifier of NSF and an ICAO airfield identifier of KNSF. Prior to merging, these separate airfield identifiers were discontinued on 29 March 2009 and all flight operations in and out of NAF Washington now use the Andrews AFB airfield identifiers of ADW and KADW as appropriate.

On 1 October 2010; the Air Force completed the merge of the 11th Wing and the 316th. The 11th Wing became the host base organization for Joint Base Andrews.

== Airlines ==
Sun Country Airlines, Delta, and various other scheduled airlines can be seen occasionally flying into ADW for para-military charters, however as of February 2025, scheduled flights out of Andrews Air Force Base are not available. 
== Joint Base Andrews ==
The base is widely known for serving as the home base of two Boeing VC-25 aircraft which use the call sign Air Force One while the President of the United States is onboard. The Boeing C-32A, which is used by the Vice President of the United States, is also based at Andrews.

The host at Andrews is the 11th Wing (11 WG), assigned to the Air Force District of Washington. The 11 WG is responsible for maintaining emergency reaction rotary-wing airlift and other National Capital Region contingency response capabilities critical to national security, and for organizing, training, equipping and deploying combat-ready forces for Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEFs).

See Joint Base Andrews for a list of units and aircraft now based at the installation.

==Geography==
Andrews Air Force Base is located at (38.803490, −76.871508), a few miles southeast of Washington, D.C. near the town of Morningside in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. It is delineated as a census-designated place by the United States Census Bureau. The CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.51%, is water.

There are two runways on the base; the western runway is in length, and the eastern runway is in length. Two additional runways have been removed, including a minor third runway between the two main runways, and a small T-shaped runway which was closed and demolished by 2008.

<text>Stephen Gardiner (27 July 1483 – 12 November 1555) was an English Catholic bishop and politician during the English Reformation period who served as Lord Chancellor during the reign of Queen Mary I and King Philip.

==Early life==
Gardiner was born in Bury St Edmunds, but the date of his birth is uncertain. His father could have been a John Gardiner, but also could have been Wyllyam Gardiner, a substantial cloth merchant of the town where he was born, who took care to give him a good education. His mother was said to be Helen Tudor, an illegitimate daughter of Jasper Tudor, 1st Duke of Bedford, but American research from 2011 suggests that this lady was the mother of a different cleric, Thomas Gardiner.

In 1511 Gardiner, aged 28, met Erasmus in Paris. He had probably already begun his studies at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself in the classics, especially in Greek. He then devoted himself to canon and civil law, in which subjects he attained so great a proficiency that no one could dispute his pre-eminence. He received the degree of doctor of civil law in 1520, and of canon law in the following year.

==Diplomatic career==
Before long his abilities attracted the notice of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, who made him his secretary, and in this capacity he is said to have been with him at The More in Hertfordshire, when the conclusion of the celebrated Treaty of the More brought King Henry VIII and the French ambassadors there. This was probably the occasion on which he first came to the King&#x27;s notice, but he does not appear to have been actively engaged in Henry&#x27;s service till three years later. He undoubtedly acquired a knowledge of foreign politics in the service of Wolsey.

In 1527 he and Sir Thomas More were named commissioners on the part of England, in arranging a treaty with the French ambassadors for the support of an army in Italy against Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. As a canon lawyer, he was sent to Orvieto in 1527 to secure a decretal commission from Pope Clement VII to allow the King&#x27;s divorce case to be tried in England. In 1535 he was also appointed ambassador to France, where he remained for three years.

==Role in the royal divorce==

That year he accompanied Wolsey on his important diplomatic mission to France, the splendour and magnificence of which have been graphically described by George Cavendish in his biography of Wolsey. Among the Cardinal&#x27;s retinue – including several noblemen and privy councillors – Gardiner alone seems to have understood the importance of this embassy. Henry was particularly anxious to cement his alliance with King Francis I of France, and gain support for his plans to divorce Catherine of Aragon. In the course of his progress through France, Wolsey received orders from Henry to send back his secretary, Gardiner, for fresh instructions. Wolsey was obliged to reply that he positively could not spare Gardiner as he was the only instrument he had in advancing the king&#x27;s &quot;Great Matter&quot;. The next year, Wolsey sent Gardiner and Edward Foxe, provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to Italy to promote the same business with the Pope. His dispatched messages have survived, and illustrate the competence with which Gardiner performed his duties.

Gardiner&#x27;s familiarity with canon law gave him a great advantage. He was instructed to procure a decretal commission from the Pope, which was intended to construct principles of law by which Wolsey might render a decision on the validity of the King&#x27;s marriage without appeal. Though supported by plausible pretexts, the demand was received as unusual and inadmissible. Pope Clement VII, who had been recently forced to seek refuge in Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo by mutinous soldiers of the Holy Roman Empire, had managed to escape to Orvieto. Now fearful of offending Charles V, nephew of Queen Catherine, Clement refused to issue a definitive ruling concerning Henry&#x27;s annulment. The matter was instead referred to his cardinals, with whom Gardiner held long debates.

Gardiner&#x27;s pleading was unsuccessful. Though the issue had not been specifically resolved, a general commission was granted, enabling Wolsey, along with Papal Legate, Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio, to try the case in England. While grateful to the Pope for the small concession, Wolsey viewed this as inadequate for the purpose in view. He urged Gardiner to press Clement VII further to deliver the desired decretal, even if it were only to be shown to the King and himself and then destroyed. Otherwise Wolsey feared he would lose his credit with Henry, who might be tempted to discard his allegiance to Rome. However, Clement VII made no further concessions at the time and Gardiner returned home. The two legates held their court under the guidelines of the general commission.

==King&#x27;s secretary, conservative and absolutist==
Gardiner was a conservative and an opponent of Anne Boleyn, Thomas Cranmer, Thomas Cromwell and of any innovation in the Church, although he acquiesced grudgingly in the steadily increasing influence of the Reformation on the royal counsels. A description of his character from George Cavendish declared him &quot;a swarthy complexion, hooked nose, deep-set eyes, a permanent frown, huge hands and a vengeful wit. He was ambitious, sure of himself, irascible, astute, and worldly.&quot;

In early August 1529 he was appointed the King&#x27;s secretary. He had already been archdeacon of Taunton for several years. The archdeaconries of Worcester and of Norfolk were also added to a list of pluralities before November 1529 and in March 1530 respectively; in April 1531 he resigned all three for that of Leicester. In 1530 the King demanded a precedent from Cambridge to procure the decision of the university as to the unlawfulness of marriage with a deceased brother&#x27;s wife: in accordance with the new plan devised for settling the question without the Pope&#x27;s intervention. In this Gardiner succeeded. In November 1531 the King rewarded him with the bishopric of Winchester, vacant since Wolsey&#x27;s death. The unexpected promotion was accompanied by expressions from the King which made it still more honourable, showing that if he had been subservient, it was not for the sake of his own advancement. Gardiner had, in fact, argued boldly with the King on some points, and Henry now reminded him of the fact. &quot;I have often squared with you, Gardiner,&quot; he said familiarly, &quot;but I love you never the worse, as the bishopric I give will convince you.&quot; In 1532, nevertheless, he displeased the King by taking part in the preparation of the &quot;Answer of the Ordinaries&quot; to the complaints brought against them in the House of Commons. On this subject he wrote to the King in his own defence.
Gardiner was not exactly, as is often said, one of Cranmer&#x27;s assessors, but, according to Cranmer&#x27;s own expression, &quot;assistant&quot; to him as counsel for the king, when the archbishop, in the absence of Queen Catherine, pronounced her marriage with Henry null and void on 23 May 1533. Immediately afterwards he was sent to Marseille, where an interview between the Pope and Francis I took place in September. Henry was deeply suspicious, as Francis, ostensibly his ally, had previously maintained the justice of his cause in the matter of the divorce. It was at this interview that Edmund Bonner intimated the appeal of Henry VIII to a general council in case the Pope should venture to proceed to sentence against him. This appeal, and another on behalf of Cranmer presented with it, were drawn up by Gardiner.

In 1535 he and other bishops were called upon to vindicate the King&#x27;s new title of &quot;Supreme Head of the Church of England.&quot; The result was his celebrated treatise &quot;De vera obedientia&quot;, the ablest of all the vindications of royal supremacy. &quot;Princes ought to be obeyed&quot;, wrote Gardiner, &quot;by the commandment of God; yea, and to be obeyed without question&quot;. He certainly believed in the semi-divinity of kings, and the divine majesty&#x27;s right to rule as if the King&#x27;s law was God&#x27;s law. In the same year he had a dispute with Cranmer about the visitation of his diocese. He was also employed to answer the Pope&#x27;s brief threatening to deprive Henry of his kingdom.

During the next few years he took part in various embassies to France and Germany. He was often so abroad, having little influence on the King&#x27;s councils; but in 1539 he took part in the enactment of the &quot;Six Articles&quot;, which led to the resignation of Bishops Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton and the persecution of the Protestant party. In 1540, on the execution of Thomas Cromwell, he was elected chancellor of the University of Cambridge. A few years later he attempted, in concert with others, to fasten a charge of heresy upon Archbishop Cranmer in connection with the Six Articles and would, but for the personal intervention of the king, probably have succeeded.

Despite having supported royal supremacy, he was a thorough opponent of the Reformation from a doctrinal point of view, and is thought to have been a leader of the Prebendaries&#x27; Plot against Cranmer. He had not approved of Henry&#x27;s general treatment of the church, especially during the ascendancy of Cromwell. In 1544 a relation of his, named German Gardiner, whom he employed as his secretary, was executed for treason in reference to the King&#x27;s supremacy, and his enemies insinuated to the King that he himself was of his secretary&#x27;s way of thinking. The King had need of him quite as much as he had of Cranmer; for it was Gardiner who, even under royal supremacy, was anxious to prove that England had not fallen away from the faith, while Cranmer&#x27;s authority as primate was necessary to upholding that supremacy.

Thus Gardiner and the Archbishop maintained opposite sides of the King&#x27;s church policy; and though Gardiner was encouraged by the King to put up articles against the archbishop for heresy, the Archbishop could always rely on the King&#x27;s protection in the end. Protestantism was gaining ground in high places, especially after the King&#x27;s marriage to Catherine Parr; the Queen herself was nearly committed for it at one time, when Gardiner, with the King&#x27;s approbation, censured some of her expressions in conversation. Just after her marriage, four men of the court were condemned at Windsor and three of them were burned. The fourth, who was the theologian and composer John Merbecke, was pardoned by Gardiner&#x27;s procurement, who said he was &quot;but a musician&quot;.

In 1546 Gardiner was the significant person involved in a conservative plot to discredit Maud Lane who was Catherine Parr&#x27;s cousin, gentlewoman and confidante. The plan was to find evidence of her heresy but the plot failed and plans to kidnap the Queen and two of her ladies were not enacted. Gardiner&#x27;s position was reduced by this.

==Edward VI&#x27;s reign==

Great as Gardiner&#x27;s influence had been with Henry VIII, his name was omitted from the King&#x27;s will, though Henry was believed to have intended making him one of his executors. Henry had made provision in his will for a 16-man Council to rule England during his son Edward&#x27;s minority (Edward VI). Gardiner was excluded from this council. Edward Seymour, a brother of Jane Seymour, seized power as Lord Protector and he and his council introduced radical Protestant reforms. Gardiner completely opposed these reforms. Between the time of Henry VIII&#x27;s death in January 1547 and the end of that year, Gardiner wrote at least 25 indignant letters arguing that the reforms were both theologically wrong and unconstitutional. Most of these letters were addressed to Somerset. He resisted the visitation of his Winchester diocese by the ecclesiastical authorities. His remonstrances resulted in imprisonment in the Fleet, and the visitation of his diocese was held during his incarceration. Although soon released, he was summoned before the council, which demanded an explanation. Refusing to answer satisfactorily on some points, Gardiner was imprisoned in the Tower of London in June 1548. Eventually he was given a lengthy appearance before the Privy Council, beginning in December 1550 and, in February 1551 he was deprived of his bishopric and returned to the Tower where he remained for the rest of the reign (a further two years). During this time he unsuccessfully requested his acknowledged right as one of the Lords Spiritual to appear before the House of Lords. His bishopric was given to John Ponet, a chaplain of Cranmer&#x27;s, translated from the bishopric of Rochester.

==Mary I&#x27;s reign==

At the accession of Queen Mary I, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and other state prisoners of high rank were in the Tower along with Gardiner; but the Queen, on her first entry into London, set them all free. Gardiner was restored to his bishopric and appointed Lord Chancellor, and he placed the crown on the Queen&#x27;s head at her coronation. He also opened her first parliament and for some time was her leading councillor. He was now also called upon, in old age, to undo not a little of the work in which he had been instrumental in his earlier years – to demonstrate the legitimacy of the Queen&#x27;s birth and the legality of her mother&#x27;s marriage, to restore the old religion, and to recant his own words touching the royal supremacy.

It is said that he wrote a formal &quot;Palinodia&quot; or retraction of his book &quot;De vera obedientia&quot;; but the reference is probably to his sermon at the start of Advent, 1554, after Cardinal (later Archbishop of Canterbury) Reginald Pole had absolved the kingdom from schism. As chancellor he had the onerous task of negotiating the Queen&#x27;s marriage treaty with Philip II of Spain, for which he shared a general repugnance. In executing it, he took care to make the terms as advantageous for England as possible, with express provision that the Spaniards should in no way be allowed to interfere in the government of the country. After the appointment of Cardinal Pole, and the reconciliation of the realm to the see of Rome, he still remained in high favour. How far he was responsible for the persecutions which afterwards arose is open to debate. He no doubt approved of the act, which passed the House of Lords while he presided there as lord chancellor, for the revival of the heresy laws.
There is no doubt that he sat in judgment on Bishop John Hooper, and on several other preachers whom he condemned to be degraded from the priesthood. The natural consequence of this was that when they declined, even as laymen, to be reconciled to the Roman Church, they were handed over to the secular power to be burned. In his diocese no victim of the persecution is known to have suffered until after his death; and, much as he was already maligned by opponents, there is much to show that his personality was generous and humane. In May 1555 he went to Calais as one of the English commissioners to promote peace with France; but their efforts were ineffectual. In October 1555 he again opened parliament as Lord Chancellor, but towards the end of the month he fell ill and grew rapidly worse until he died.

==Death==
Bishop Gardiner died at Westminster on 12 November 1555. He was temporarily buried in a vault at the church of St Mary Overie, and in February 1556 his body was conveyed to Winchester Cathedral, where, after a number of ceremonies, a final funeral service was conducted on 28 February 1556, at which time it was recorded that he had not been buried and that no ground was broken, in the expectation that in due course his executors would build a chapel within the cathedral for his entombment. Some claim that his last words were &quot;Erravi cum Petro, sed non flevi cum Petro&quot; (I have erred like Peter, but I have not wept like Peter).

==Fictional portrayals==
Gardiner plays an important part in William Shakespeare and John Fletcher’s play &quot;Henry VIII&quot;.

Bishop Gardiner is a character in &quot;The Fifth Queen&quot; trilogy by Ford Madox Ford. Gardiner is a major character in &quot;The Path to Somerset&quot; by Janet Wertman, which centers on his rivalry with the rising Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset.

Gardiner is a prominent character in Hilary Mantel&#x27;s &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, &quot;Bring Up the Bodies&quot; and &quot;The Mirror &amp; the Light&quot;, where he appears as an implacable opponent of Thomas Cromwell. In the television adaptation &quot;Wolf Hall&quot;, Gardiner is portrayed by Mark Gatiss. In the second series, based on the third book, Alex Jennings plays Gardiner.

Gardiner is the villain in Alison MacLeod&#x27;s 1965 historical novel &quot;The Heretic&quot;, a biography of the Protestant martyr Anne Askew, of whose execution Gardiner was the main instigator.

Gardiner is played by Terence Rigby in the 1998 film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, where he is portrayed as a villainous bishop who took part in the Ridolfi plot and who vehemently opposed Elizabeth I&#x27;s Act of Uniformity; in reality, Gardiner had died before Elizabeth ascended the throne. A more accurate portrayal of Gardiner can be seen in the BBC dramas &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (in both of which he is played by Basil Dignam). In &quot;The Tudors&quot; television series Gardiner is played by Simon Ward.

In the 2022 Starz series &quot;Becoming Elizabeth&quot; Bishop Gardiner is portrayed by Alex Macqueen. In the 2023 film &quot;Firebrand&quot;, Simon Russell Beale portrays Gardiner.

<text>Roxana (died BC, , ; Old Iranian: &quot;*Raṷxšnā-&quot; &quot;shining, radiant, brilliant&quot;, ) sometimes known as Roxanne, Roxanna and Roxane was a Sogdian or a Bactrian princess whom Alexander the Great married after defeating Darius, ruler of the Achaemenid Empire, and invading Persia. 

== Biography ==
Roxana was born as the daughter of a Bactrian nobleman named Oxyartes, the satrap of Bactria and Sogdia, who served Bessus, and thus probably also involved in the murder of the last Achaemenid king Darius III. The exact date of her birth is unknown, but she was of childbearing age by 326 BC, placing her birth before 336 BC.

After Bessus was captured by the Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great, Oxyartes and his family continued to resist the Macedonians, and, along with other notables such as the Sogdian warlord Spitamenes, took up a defensive position in a fortress known as the Sogdian Rock.

They were eventually defeated by Alexander, who attended a celebration, and reportedly fell in love with Roxana on sight. The location of the celebration took place is disputed, possibly in the Sogdian Rock or another fortress of Chorienes (also called Sisimithres by Quintus Rufus Curtius), but according to the Metz Epitome it was in the house of Chorienes in which Roxana was introduced to Alexander as the daughter of Oxyartes. Curtius apparently misrepresented Roxana as a daughter of Chorienes. Arrian states that Oxyartes surrendered to Alexander when he became aware of the good reception Alexander awarded his daughter Roxana. A.B. Bosworth mentions the possibility of Roxana being captured at the Sogdian Rock, but that the two married at the fortress of Chorienes. The marriage was in 327 BC, and according to the majority of the sources it was in the Macedonian rite rather than the Persian. The sources agree that Alexander fell passionately in love with her, but considering that he had difficulties in occupying and controlling Sogdiana his decision to marry Roxana may also have been motivated by the advantages of a political alliance.

Alexander married Roxana despite opposition from his companions who would have preferred a Macedonian or other Greek to become queen. However, the marriage was also politically advantageous as it made the Sogdian army more loyal towards Alexander and less rebellious after their defeat. Alexander thereafter made an expedition into India and while there he appointed Oxyartes as the governor of the Hindu Kush region adjoining India. Roxana accompanied Alexander into India, where their first child died at or soon after birth near the banks of the Acesines River in November 326 BC. 

When Alexander returned to Susa in spring 324 BC, he promoted a brother of Roxana to the elite cavalry. To encourage a better acceptance of his government among the Persians, Alexander also married Stateira II, the daughter of the deposed Persian king Darius III.

After Alexander&#x27;s sudden death at Babylon in 323 BC, Roxana is believed to have murdered Stateira. According to Plutarch, she also had Stateira&#x27;s sister, Drypetis, murdered with the consent of Perdiccas. Roxana was pregnant, which caused some discussions between Alexander&#x27;s loyalists around Perdiccas and Ptolemy who suggested waiting to see if Alexander&#x27;s posthumous child was a son and naming either a caretaker regent or a council to govern on his behalf, and the Macedonian soldiers who opposed a so-called persianization of the Macedonian court. 

For the Macedonian succession a temporary compromise was found as Philip Arrhidaeus was declared king of Macedon; if the unborn child was a son, he was to become a king as well. By 317 though, Roxana&#x27;s son, called Alexander IV lost his kingship as a result of intrigues started by Philip Arrhidaeus&#x27; wife, Eurydice II. Afterwards, Roxana and the young Alexander were protected by Alexander the Great&#x27;s mother, Olympias, in Macedonia. Following Olympias&#x27; assassination in 316 BC, Cassander imprisoned Roxana and her son in the citadel of Amphipolis. Their detention was condemned by the Macedonian general Antigonus in 315 BC. In 311 BC, a peace treaty between Antigonus and Cassander confirmed the kingship of Alexander IV but also Cassander as his guardian, following which the Macedonians demanded his release. However, Cassander ordered Glaucias of Macedon to kill Alexander and Roxana. It is assumed that they were murdered in spring 310 BC, but their death was concealed until the summer. The two were killed after Heracles, a son of Alexander the Great&#x27;s mistress Barsine, was murdered, bringing the Argead dynasty to an end.

==Legacy==

* Asteroid 317 Roxane is named in her honor.

* At the Acropolis, there were found inscriptions of offerings Roxana dedicated as Alexander&#x27;s wife to Athena.

* Lucian describes a painting of Roxana&#x27;s marriage to Alexander by the Greek painter Echion (also known as Aetion) which won the painter the consent of the Olympic Hellanodike Proxenidas to marry his daughter.
* In one of the versions of the Alexander Romances, Darius III is her father and dying gives his consent to the marriage in which she wears the royal jewelry Alexander had asked for at from his mother Olympias. The marriage takes then place in Darius&#x27; palace.

<text>John Alcock ( – 1 October 1500) was an English churchman, bishop and Lord Chancellor.

==Biography==
Alcock was born at Beverley in Yorkshire, son of Sir William Alcock, Burgess of Kingston upon Hull, and was educated at Beverley Grammar School and the University of Cambridge. In 1461 he was made dean of St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, Westminster, and his subsequent promotion was rapid in both church and state. In the following year he was made Master of the Rolls, and in 1470 was sent as ambassador to the Crown Court of Castile. He was nominated to the see of Rochester on 8 January 1472, was consecrated Bishop of Rochester on 15 March and was successively translated to the see of Worcester on 15 July 1476 and the see of Ely on 6 October 1486. He was the first president of the Council of the Marches in Wales from 1473 to 1500. He twice held the office of Lord Chancellor, once from June 1475 to September 1475 and then again from October 1485 to March 1487.

Alcock was one of the leading pre-Reformation divines; he was a man of deep learning and also of great proficiency as an architect. Besides founding a charity at Beverley and endowing Hull Grammar School, he restored many churches and colleges; but his greatest achievement was the building of Jesus College, Cambridge, which he established on the site of the former Convent of St Radegund.

Alcock was appointed to the Council in 1470 and became Master of the Rolls in 1471, soon after being appointed tutor to King Edward IV&#x27;s eldest son, Prince Edward. After the King&#x27;s death he was with Prince Edward when he was intercepted by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, at Stony Stratford. Alcock was arrested and removed from office but soon rejoined the council. He was with King Richard III when he entered York in August 1483 and was a member of the English delegation that met the Scots at Nottingham.

Later Alcock was one of several clerics who openly canvassed the proposition that Henry Tudor marry Elizabeth of York. Appointed temporary Lord Chancellor he opened King Henry VII&#x27;s first Parliament on 7 November 1485 and became one of the new king&#x27;s most trusted servants.

Alcock died on 1 October 1500 and lies buried in the Alcock Chantry in Ely Cathedral.

==Writings==
Alcock&#x27;s published writings, most of which are extremely rare, are: &quot;Mons Perfectionis, or the Hill of Perfection&quot; (London, 1497); &quot;Gallicontus Johannis Alcock episcopi Eliensis ad frates suos curatas in sinodo apud Barnwell&quot; (1498), a good specimen of early English printing and quaint illustrations; &quot;The Castle of Labour&quot;, translated from the French (1536), and various other tracts and homilies.

<text>Sir Robert Naunton (1563 – 27 March 1635) was an English writer and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1606 and 1626.

==Family==
Robert Naunton was the son of Henry Naunton of Alderton, Suffolk, and Elizabeth Asheby of Hornsby, Leicestershire. According to Schreiber, the Nauntons were &quot;established members of the county gentry and had been so for well over two centuries&quot;. Robert Naunton&#x27;s grandfather, William Naunton, was trained as a lawyer and married Elizabeth Wingfield, the daughter Sir Anthony Wingfield, a trusted servant of Henry VIII. William Naunton was a Member of Parliament, and one of the principal officers of the King&#x27;s brother-in-law, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and later of his widow, Katherine Willoughby, Duchess of Suffolk. Robert Naunton&#x27;s father, Henry, served as Master of Horse to the Dowager Duchess, while his maternal uncle, William Ashby, was a member of the diplomatic service under Queen Elizabeth.

==Career==

He was educated at Norwich School and Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow of his college in 1585 and public orator of the university in 1594. Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, commissioned him to spend some time abroad, sending information about European affairs. On his return, Naunton was elected Member of Parliament for Helston at a by-election in 1606. Naunton visited the court in London in October 1605. He thought that Anne of Denmark&#x27;s farthingale might conceal a pregnancy, writing, &quot;The Queen is generally held to be pregnant, but no appearance eminent by reason of the short vardugals in use&quot;.

On 7 September 1615, Naunton was knighted. In 1616, he became Master of Requests and later surveyor of the court of wards. In December 1617 his friend George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham procured for him the position of Secretary of State on the condition of his making Christopher Villiers, Buckingham&#x27;s brother, his heir, and during his lifetime Villiers gained from Naunton estates worth £500 a year. In 1621 Naunton was elected MP for Cambridge University. 

His strong Protestant opinions led him to favour more active intervention by England in the interests of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and more vigorous application of the laws against Roman Catholics. Naunton was censured after the Spanish ambassador, Gondomar, complained to King James I. Consequently, in January 1623, Naunton resigned as Secretary of State and was made master of the Court of Wards and Liveries.

Sir Robert was re-elected MP for Cambridge University in 1624 and 1625. He was elected MP for Suffolk in 1626. Naunton died at Letheringham, Suffolk at the age of 71.

==Marriages and issue==

Naunton married secondly Penelope Perrot, widow of the astronomer Sir William Lower, and daughter of Sir Thomas Perrot and Dorothy Devereux, daughter of Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex.

Naunton&#x27;s daughter Penelope married firstly Paul Bayning, 2nd Viscount Bayning (son of Paul Bayning, 1st Viscount Bayning), and secondly Philip Herbert, 5th Earl of Pembroke in his first marriage, by whom he became the grandfather of William Herbert, 6th Earl of Pembroke.

==Works==

Naunton&#x27;s account of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s reign was still in manuscript when he died. As &quot;Fragmenta regalia&quot;, written by Sir Robert Naunton, it was printed in 1641 and again in 1642, a revised edition &quot;Fragmenta Regalia, or Observations on the late Queen Elizabeth, her Times and Favourites&quot;, being issued in 1653. It was again published in 1824, and an edition edited by Edward Arber was brought out in 1870. It has also been printed in several collections and has been translated into French and Italian. There are several manuscript copies extant, and some of Naunton&#x27;s letters are in the British Museum and in other collections. A modern critical edition was prepared by J. S. Cerovski and published in 1985.

He is the source for Elizabeth&#x27;s rebuke to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester: &quot;by God there shall be one mistress here and no master&quot;. He is also noted for his judgement of Henry VIII &quot;He never spared a man in his anger or a woman in his lust&quot;. He was largely responsible for the claim that Sir John Perrot, his wife&#x27;s grandfather, was Henry VIII&#x27;s natural son.

<doc id="262164" wikidata="Q380823" url="?curid=262164" title="Molineux Stadium">
<text>Molineux Stadium ( ) is a football stadium situated in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. It has been the home ground of Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers since 1889. The first stadium built for use by a Football League club, it was one of the first British grounds to have floodlights installed and hosted some of the earliest European club games in the 1950s.

At the time of its multi-million pound renovation in the early 1990s, Molineux was one of the biggest and most modern stadia in England, though it has since been eclipsed by other ground developments. The stadium has hosted England internationals and, more recently, England under-21 internationals, as well as the first UEFA Cup Final in 1972.

Molineux is a 31,750 all-seater stadium, but it consistently attracted much greater attendances when it was mostly terracing. The record attendance is 61,315. Plans were announced in 2010 for a £40 million redevelopment programme to rebuild and link three sides of the stadium to increase capacity to 38,000 seats. The first stage of this project, the Stan Cullis Stand, was completed in 2012. The next two stages were postponed because the club prioritised funds for development of the youth academy. There are provisional plans for a longer term redevelopment of every stand that could create a 50,000 capacity.

==Stadium==

The stadium is a few hundred yards north of Wolverhampton city centre, at the far side of the city&#x27;s ring road, and is a prominent building due to its size in an area with predominantly low-rise buildings.

It consists of four stands:

The Steve Bull Stand (formerly the John Ireland Stand). The Sir Jack Hayward Stand (formerly the Jack Harris Stand and also known as &#x27;The South Bank&#x27;), is a single tier, safe standing terrace. The Stan Cullis Stand (also known as The North Bank) is the most recently renovated stand. The Billy Wright Stand holds the team dressing rooms, media booths and the family section.

The total seated capacity of the stands is approximately 31,500, with a temporary seating area lifting the present official capacity to 32,050. The current stadium design stems from the early 1990s when it was extensively redeveloped to become a modern all-seater venue in accordance with the Taylor Report, which required British football stadia to provide seating for all those attending.

In the days before seating regulations, the ground could hold more than 60,000 spectators; the record attendance for a match at the ground is 61,315 for a Football League First Division game against Liverpool on 11 February 1939. The 1940s and 1950s saw average attendances for seasons regularly exceed 40,000, coinciding with the club&#x27;s peak on the field.

Molineux has hosted six England internationals. The first was a 6–1 win over Ireland on 7 March 1891. England again beat Ireland, this time 4–0, on 14 February 1903 and lost to Wales 2–1 on 5 February 1936. The fourth was a 5–2 defeat of Denmark in a 1958 World Cup qualifier on 5 December 1956. In 2022 Molineux hosted a 0-0 Nationals League draw with Italy and a 0-4 defeat to Hungary. It has also hosted four England under-21 internationals (in 1996, 2008, 2014 and 2018) and, in 2005, hosted some European Youth Championship qualifying matches.

On 24 June 2003, Molineux also became Wolverhampton&#x27;s biggest live concert venue, with Bon Jovi performing in front of 34,000 people.

Up until May 2011, the ground had a capacity of 29,400. However the 5,500 Stan Cullis Stand was knocked down for redevelopment and 230 seats in the lower tier of the Steve Bull Stand were taken out as part of the process taking temporary capacity down to 23,670. The lower tier of the new North Bank (holding 4,000) was opened for use in September 2011 for the team&#x27;s second home game of the season, which took the stadium capacity up to 27,670. The upper tier on the new stand (3,700 seats) was completed by the start of the 2012–13 season, taking the overall capacity of the stadium up to 31,700. However the club have delayed the second phase of the redevelopment in rebuilding the Steve Bull Stand. Following relegation from the top flight in 2012, the South-West Corner was dismantled until regaining promotion six years later.

==History==
===Origins===
The Molineux name originates from Benjamin Molineux, a successful local merchant (and a distant relative of the now extinct Earls of Sefton) who, in 1744, purchased land on which he built Molineux House (later converted to the Molineux Hotel) and on which the stadium would eventually be built. The estate was purchased in 1860 by O.E. McGregor, who converted the land into a pleasure park open to the public. Molineux Grounds, as it was titled, included a wide range of facilities including an ice rink, a cycling track, a boating lake, and, most crucially, an area for football.

The grounds were sold to the Northampton Brewery in 1889, who rented its use to Wolverhampton Wanderers, who had previously played at Dudley Road. After renovating the site, Molineux became the first stadium to be exclusively used as a ground for a football team. The first league game to be played in the stadium was staged on 7 September 1889 in a 2–0 victory over Notts County before a crowd of 4,000.

Wolves bought the freehold in 1923 for £5,607 (£303,338.70 in 2018 prices) and soon set about constructing a major grandstand on the Waterloo Road side (designed by Archibald Leitch). In 1932, the club also built a new stand on the Molineux Street side and followed this by adding a roof to the South Bank two years later. The stadium finally now had four stands, which formed Molineux for the next half-century. The South Bank Stand terraces were one of the largest goal stands in Britain.

In 1953, the club became one of the first in Britain to install floodlights, at a cost of around £10,000 (£274,000 in 2018 prices). The first-ever floodlit game was held on 30 September 1953, as Wolves won 3–1 against South Africa. The referee for this match was Mr. F Read of Willenhall. The addition of the floodlights opened the door for Molineux to host a series of midweek friendlies against teams from across the globe. In the days prior to the formation of the European Cup and international club competitions, these games were highly prestigious and gained huge crowds and interest, the BBC often televising such events. A new taller set of floodlights were later installed in 1957, at a cost of £25,000 (£595,000 in 2018 prices), as the stadium prepared to host its first European Cup games.

===Further redevelopment and decline===
In 1958, plans were unveiled to rebuild Molineux into a 70,000 capacity stadium during the early 1960s, but these were rejected by the local council and there were no major changes at the stadium for another 20 years.

The Molineux Street Stand (by now all-seater) failed to meet the standards of the 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act. The club set about building a new stand behind the existing one, on land where housing had been demolished. The new stand, designed by architects Atherden and Rutter, had a 9,348 capacity, equipped with 42 executive boxes, although sporting red seats in contrast to the club&#x27;s traditional colours. When the construction was complete, the old stand lying in front was demolished, leaving the stand some 100 ft from the touchline. This new stand, named the John Ireland Stand (after the then-club president), was opened on 25 August 1979 at the start of a First Division game against Ipswich Town. This was intended as the first phase of a complete reconstruction of the ground, which would have given it a 40,000 capacity by 1984 and made it the first completely rebuilt stadium in postwar league football. However, the John Ireland Stand was the only phase of this project which would become reality. Further redevelopment was still a decade away.

In 1981, plans were unveiled for further redevelopment at the stadium which would have cost more than £4million and involved five-a-side football pitches, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, and an eight-lane running track. However, these were soon scrapped due to rising debts.

The John Ireland Stand (renamed as The Steve Bull Stand in 2003), completed in 1979, had cost £2.5 million (£13,675,000 in 2018 prices) and had been one of the most expensive developments at any football ground in the U.K. The cost of the stand&#x27;s construction plunged Wolves deep into debt and the club narrowly avoided liquidation in 1982, when it was taken over by a group fronted by former player Derek Dougan.

By the time Wolves slid into the Football League Fourth Division in 1986, the John Ireland Stand and the South Bank terrace were the only sections of the ground in use, after new safety laws implemented following the Bradford City stadium fire forced the closure of the North Bank and Waterloo Road Stand, which had become very dilapidated. Additionally, attendances had fallen due to the club&#x27;s on-the-field decline.

The club&#x27;s perilous financial situation meant the stadium fell into ruin, with no funding either for repairs or to move the pitch. The club was saved from folding in August 1986 when Wolverhampton Council bought the ground for £1,120,000 (£3,236,800 in 2018 prices), along with the surrounding land, while Gallagher Estates, in conjunction with the Asda Superstore chain, agreed to pay off the outstanding debt – subject to building and planning permission for a superstore being granted. Although the stadium continued in use, the disused sections were never reopened.

===Present-day stadium===
The takeover of the club and stadium by Sir Jack Hayward in 1990 paved the way for redevelopment, which was further prompted by legislation following the Taylor Report that outlawed terraces which affected Premier League and Division One stadiums from the 1993–94 season. The North Bank terrace was demolished in October 1991 and the new Stan Cullis Stand was completed in August 1992, in time for the 1992–93 season. Next came the demolition of the Waterloo Road Stand, with the new Billy Wright Stand opening in August 1993. The final phase of the redevelopment came in December 1993, when the new Jack Harris Stand was opened on the site of the South Bank terrace.

The newly renovated stadium was officially opened on 7 December 1993, in a friendly with Honvéd, the Hungarian team who had been beaten in one of Molineux&#x27;s most famous original floodlit friendlies.

In 2003, the John Ireland Stand was renamed the Steve Bull Stand (in honour of the club&#x27;s record goalscorer) and, at the same time, the south-west corner of the ground was filled with 900 temporary seats, known as the Graham Hughes Stand, which, until their removal in the summer of 2006, raised the Molineux capacity to 29,400. This seating area – now officially named the Wolves Community Trust Stand – was again added on the club&#x27;s return to the top flight in 2009, which lifted the capacity to 29,195 before the club began its redevelopment of the stadium in summer 2011. In August 2015, the Jack Harris Stand was renamed the Sir Jack Hayward Stand in honour of Steve Morgan&#x27;s predecessor as the club&#x27;s owner, who had died earlier that year.

The record attendance for the stadium in its current configuration is 31,746, which was achieved against Liverpool on 23 January 2020 in the Premier League.

==Current redevelopment==

Plans were announced in May 2010 to begin an extensive multi-million pound programme of redevelopment to enlarge the stadium&#x27;s capacity and develop its facilities. A full application for planning permission was submitted in September 2010, and granted three months later.

Phase 1 of this process was confirmed in February 2011, and commenced on 23 May 2011 as demolition of the Stan Cullis Stand began. In its place a new two-tier stand (seating 7,798), complete with mega-store, museum, café and hospitality facilities, was planned for the 2012–13 season which extended around into the north-east corner.

This phase, costing an estimated £18 million, was carried out by contractors the Buckingham Group. By September 2011 the lower tier was opened to fans, permitting a temporary stadium capacity of 27,828. The stand was fully opened on 11 August 2012 for the club&#x27;s first fixture of the 2012–13 season, creating a new official stadium capacity of 31,700.

Phase 2 will be the rebuilding of the Steve Bull Stand over a two-season period. Work was initially set to begin in summer 2012, but has since been postponed with no revised start date yet set. In January 2013 club owner Steve Morgan stated the club would prioritise the redevelopment of its academy facilities over the stadium. At the conclusion of this stage stadium capacity would reach around 36,000 and see this stand connected to the new Stan Cullis Stand. Proceeding with this second stage would raise the redevelopment spend to in excess of £40 million.

Phase 3 is subject to demand and finance, but is planned to be the construction of a new top-tier on the Sir Jack Hayward Stand, that will connect it to the new Steve Bull Stand. This would bring capacity up to around 38,000.

Phase 4 is a tentative plan to completely redevelop the Billy Wright Stand in a move that would bring capacity to 50,000. However, no planning permission has yet been sought for this phase and it remains only a potential, rather than planned, development with no timeframe in place.

<doc id="262167" wikidata="Q451093" url="?curid=262167" title="Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, 1st Count of Gondomar">
<text>Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, 1st Count of Gondomar (November 1, 1567 – October 2, 1626), referred to simply as Count Gondomar, was a Spanish nobleman and diplomat. He twice served as the Spain&#x27;s ambassador to England and later held an informal but influential role as Spain&#x27;s leading expert on English affairs, a position he maintained until his death.

In England, Gondomar was widely regarded as the leader of a Spanish faction at the English court, a confidant privy to the inner thoughts of King James I, and working to advance the Papist cause. The term &quot;Machiavellian&quot; entered common English usage largely in reference to him.

==Early life==
Gondomar was born into a noble family on November 1, 1567, at the episcopal palace in Astorga, the residence of his paternal uncle. He was the eldest son of García Sarmiento de Sotomayor, Lord of Gondomar and Vincios, and Juana de Acuña, daughter of the Dukes of Valencia de Don Juan. 

In 1579, García Sarmiento de Sotomayor created the lordship of Gondomar and Vincios, which Gondomar, as first-born inherited, upon his father&#x27;s death later that very same year. 

At the age of 14, Gondomar was married to his niece Beatriz Sarmiento y Mendoza, who died five years later while he was serving in Italy. Two years after her death, he married Constanza de Acuña, with whom he had eight children. 
During the Anglo-Spanish War, Gondomar played a key role in defending the towns of Baiona and Vigo against an English raid led by Sir Francis Drake in 1585. Four years later, they clashed again in Vigo, after the English Armada was repelled in A Coruña and Lisbon; in the assault on A Coruña Drake was defeated but not before the bombing and sack of the town. Thanks to these military successes, King Philip II of Spain appointed Gondomar military governor of Baiona and the fortress of Monte Real, giving him responsibility for securing the southern border and coastline of Galicia.

In 1596, he was appointed first &quot;corregidor&quot;, or governor, of Toro, and later of Valladolid, then the residence and capital of King Philip III. From that moment he was forced to reconcile both roles, as courtier and corregidor in the capital, and as soldier and Capitan in Galicia: in 1603 he was sent from court to Vigo to oversee the distribution of the treasure brought from America by two galleons which were driven to take refuge there; on his return he was appointed a member of the board of finance. In 1609 he repelled a Dutch naval attack on the coast of Galicia.

Although he held both military and administrative employs, his residence was at Valladolid, where he owned the &quot;Casa del Sol&quot; estate and was already amassing his fine library. He was known as a courtier, and apparently as a friend of the favourite, the Duke of Lerma. In 1612 he was appointed ambassador in England, but he did not leave to take up his appointment until May 1613.

==Ambassadorship==
Gondomar&#x27;s reputation as a diplomat, which brought him to international historical prominence, is based on his two periods of service in England – from 1613 to 1618 and from 1619 to 1622. The excellence of his latinity pleased the literary tastes of King James I, whose character he judged with remarkable insight. He flattered the king&#x27;s love of books and of peace, and he made skilful use of the king&#x27;s desire for a matrimonial alliance between the Prince of Wales and the &quot;infanta&quot; Maria Anna of Spain (the proposed &quot;Spanish Match&quot;). The British historian J. P. Kenyon calls him &quot;a cleverer man than any in England&quot;, who was gifted enough to tie England to Spain&#x27;s interests for the next decade.

The ambassador&#x27;s task in the prelude to the Thirty Years&#x27; War was to keep James from aiding the Protestant states against Spain and Habsburg Austria, and to avert English attacks on Spanish possessions in the Americas. His success made him odious to the anti-Spanish and Puritan parties. The active part he took in promoting the execution of Sir Walter Raleigh aroused particular animosity. He was attacked by popular pamphleteers — Thomas Scott&#x27;s extravagant propaganda, &quot;Vox populi&quot;, was widely believed — and the dramatist Thomas Middleton made him a principal character in the strange political play &quot;A Game at Chess&quot;, which was suppressed by order of the council.
The Howards were Gondomar&#x27;s principal friends at court – Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton (died 1614), Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, Lord High Treasurer, whose daughter was married to James&#x27;s favourite, Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral, Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, and their protégés. The &quot;Howard faction&quot; preferred a marriage alliance with Spain over one with France, the traditional ally of Scotland, and they preferred to keep out of open warfare with Spain promoted by the more zealous Puritans. Most of the Howards were Catholics, encouraging them towards a spirit of toleration at home. Like many at the English court, they were receiving pensions from Spain, The pensions had been instituted with the first Spanish embassy to James, to the annual tune of £9125. Gondomar, with an English reputation as a spymaster, actually spent a paltry average of £350 for information. without much effect on their opinions and actions, and Gondomar seldom had the money to follow through. Among the pensioners, in an embarrassing list that surfaced in 1613, at Gondomar&#x27;s first arrival was the King of England himself.

Gondomar conceived of his embassy as a sortie in enemy country, and he took for his maxim &quot;aventurar la vida y osar morir&quot; (&quot;risk your life and dare to die&quot;). His opening challenge was his refusal to strike the colours of Spain at his warships&#x27; entry to Portsmouth harbour, in which an appeal to the king averted an exchange of cannon fire. His handling of the unconditional release of the Catholic agitator Luisa Carvajal y Mendoza further established him in James&#x27;s eyes as a man of unexpected strength. In 1617 Sarmiento was created Count of Gondomar. The key to Gondomar&#x27;s success was his relationship with James, whom he brought to admire and like his witty and learned companionship, his candour, within the obvious limits, and his personal integrity. They called themselves the &quot;two Diegos&quot; and drank from the same bottle (Carter 1964:205). It was to Gondomar, after the failure of the Addled Parliament of 1614, that James made his celebrated remark &quot;I am amazed that my ancestors should have allowed such an institution to come into existence&quot;.

A key program for Gondomar at the outset was to block the marriage negotiations between Prince Charles and a sister of Louis XIII of France, a French counterweight to marital alliances being concluded with the Spanish Habsburgs (see the Spanish Match).

In the matter of Sir Walter Raleigh, it was Gondomar&#x27;s pressure that cost Sir Walter his head on 29 October 1618. In a moment of weakness, James had shown Gondomar the contract under which Raleigh had sailed, and the restriction upon attacking Spanish settlements, in order to mollify Gondomar&#x27;s objections to an enterprise on which James had set his heart. Raleigh&#x27;s attack on San Thomé (near modern Ciudad Guayana) was a public violation; his execution kept the peace with Spain. The English could not forgive Gondomar, who in 1618 obtained leave to come home for his health, but he was then ordered to return by way of Flanders and France with a diplomatic mission.

In 1619 he returned to London and remained until 1622. The Guyana expedition of Roger North in 1620 seemed to be a repeat of Raleigh&#x27;s violation of Spanish settlements in the Caribbean, and at Gondomar&#x27;s insistence, North was imprisoned.

The tensest late confrontation was over Count Mansfeld&#x27;s projected movement of troops raised in England to rescue James&#x27;s son-in-law Frederick V, Elector Palatine, the &quot;Winter King&quot; of Bohemia. Habsburg Madrid and Brussels were concerned that the French aimed to join Mansfeld&#x27;s forces and retrieve Artois for France, and the project was let slide.

When Gondomar was allowed to retire and return to Spain, he was named a member of the royal council and governor of one of the king&#x27;s palaces, and he was appointed to a complimentary mission to Vienna. Gondomar was in Madrid when the Prince of Wales— afterwards Charles I— made his journey there in search of a wife. He died at the house of the Constable of Castile, near Haro in La Rioja.

Gondomar was twice married, first to his niece Beatrix Sarmiento, by whom he had no children, and then to his cousin Constanza de Acuña, by whom he had four sons and three daughters. The hatred he aroused in England, which was shown by the widespread mockery of an intestinal complaint from which he suffered for years, was a tribute to the zeal with which he served his own master.

Gondomar collected, both before he came to London and during his residence there, a fine library of printed books and manuscripts. Orders for the arrangement, binding and storing of his books in his house at Valladolid appear frequently in his voluminous correspondence. In 1785 the library was ceded by his descendant and representative the marquis of Malpica to Charles III of Spain, and it is now in the Royal Library at Madrid.

A portrait of Gondomar, attributed to Diego Velázquez, was formerly at Stowe, Buckinghamshire. It was mezzotinted by Robert Cooper.

==Gondomar and the Galician language==

Part of the private correspondence of Gondomar with his relatives and with other Galician noblemen has been preserved in the archives of the house of Alba. These private letters are frequently written totally or partially in Galician, and represent an invaluable source for the knowledge of this language in the transition from Old Galician to Middle Galician, a period for which there are but a few literary or public documents preserved. Gondomar is also well known for his Galician patriotic writings in defence of the antiquity and noblesse of the Kingdom of Galicia and of the Galicians, because &#x27;Galicia was a Kingdom and her kings got this title well before any other in Spain&#x27;.

==1911 Encyclopædia Britannica Authorities==
Gondomar&#x27;s missions to England were largely dealt with in Samuel Rawson Gardiner&#x27;s &quot;History of England&quot; (London, 1883–1884) and more recently in Glyn Redworth, &quot;The Prince and the Infanta: The Cultural Politics of the Spanish Match&quot; (New Haven, 2003).

In Spanish, Don Pascual de Gayangos wrote a useful biographical introduction to a publication of a few of his letters – &quot;Cinco Cartas politico-literarias de Don Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, conde de Gondomar&quot;, issued at Madrid in 1869 by the &quot;Sociedad de Bibliófilos&quot; of the Spanish Academy; and there is a life in English by F.H. Lyon (1910).

<doc id="262170" wikidata="Q594328" url="?curid=262170" title="Black-shouldered kite">
<text>The black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris), also known as the Australian black-shouldered kite, is a small raptor found in open habitats throughout Australia. It resembles similar species found in Africa, Eurasia and North America, including the black-winged kite, a species that has in the past also been called &quot;black-shouldered kite&quot;. Measuring around in length, with a wingspan of , the adult black-shouldered kite has predominantly grey-white plumage and prominent black markings above its red eyes. It gains its name from the black patches on its wings. The primary call is a clear whistle, uttered in flight and while hovering. It can be confused with the related letter-winged kite in Australia, which is distinguished by the striking black markings under its wings.

The species forms monogamous pairs, breeding between August and January. The birds engage in aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within five weeks of hatching and can hunt for mice within a week of leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from their home territory. The black-shouldered kite hunts in open grasslands, searching for its prey by hovering and systematically scanning the ground. It mainly eats small rodents, particularly the introduced house mouse, and has benefitted from the modification of the Australian landscape by agriculture. It is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&#x27;s Red List of Threatened Species.

==Taxonomy==

The black-shouldered kite was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801, as &quot;Falco axillaris&quot;. Its specific name is derived from the Latin &quot;axilla&quot;, meaning &quot;armpit&quot;, relating to the dark patches under the wings. He reported the description came from a bird that had been kept for two months in the early colony.
The species description was based on one of four paintings by Australian painter Thomas Watling of a bird in the Sydney district in the 1790s.

English naturalist John Gould described the same species as &quot;Elanus notatus&quot; in 1838 from a specimen from New South Wales, apparently unaware of Latham&#x27;s description. English zoologist George Robert Gray followed Latham using the binomial &quot;Elanus axillaris&quot; in 1849. Gould conceded Latham&#x27;s name was valid and hence had precedence, and &quot;E. notatus&quot; was reduced to synonymy. Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews argued that Latham&#x27;s description mentioned &quot;black&quot; axillaries and hence must have referred to the letter-winged kite, and that Watling&#x27;s drawings were inconclusive. He promoted the use of &quot;E. notatus&quot; over &quot;E. axillaris&quot; in 1916. This was followed for many years. But in 1980 Australian taxonomists Richard Schodde and Ian J. Mason refuted Mathews&#x27; claim that the original description of &quot;E. axillaris&quot; was ambiguous and reinstated the name. This has been followed by subsequent authorities. The black-shouldered kite has no recognised subspecies.

&quot;Black-shouldered kite&quot; has been designated the official English name by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC). It has also been called the Australian black-shouldered kite to distinguish it from the Eurasian black-winged kite (&quot;E. caeruleus&quot;) and American white-tailed kite (&quot;E. leucurus&quot;)—both formerly known as &quot;black-shouldered kite&quot;. Watling had recorded the Dharug term &quot;Geo-ga-rack&quot;.

In 1959, American ornithologist Kenneth C. Parkes noted that the plumage of the black-shouldered kite is similar to that of the black-winged and white-tailed kites, and proposed that all three were subspecies of a single cosmopolitan species &quot;E. caeruleus&quot;—much like the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;). Researchers William S. Clark and Richard C. Banks disputed this, pointing out the differences in anatomical proportions such as wing shape and tail length, and hunting behavior (&quot;E. caeruleus&quot; rarely hunts by hovering, unlike the other two species) and proposed the species be separated again in 1992. They are regarded as distinct in the IOC World Bird List.

Molecular evidence shows that the black-shouldered kite and its relatives belong to a subfamily Elaninae that is an early offshoot within the raptor family Accipitridae. There is some evidence they are more divergent from other raptors and better placed in their own family.

==Description==

The adult black-shouldered kite is around in length, with a wingspan of between . The female is slightly heavier, weighing on average around compared to the male&#x27;s average weight of . The sexes have similar plumage. The crown, neck and upperparts are pale grey, while the head and underparts are white. A black comma-shaped marking lies in front of and stretches over and behind the eye, which is deep red and surrounded by a black orbital ring. The leading edge of the outer wing is black. When perched, this gives the species its prominent black &quot;shoulders&quot;. The central rectrices of the tail are pale grey, while the rest of the tail feathers are white. The bill is short with a sharp, hooked tip to the upper mandible. Its nostrils and the cere are bright or dull yellow and the bill is black. The legs and feet are also yellow or golden-yellow, and the feet have three toes facing forwards and one toe facing backwards.

The juvenile has a white forehead and chin and rusty brown neck, nape and breast with darker streaks. The back and wings are mottled buff or brown. There is a less distinctive dark shoulder patch, but a larger comma-shaped patch over the eyes. The eyes themselves are dark brown. The bill is black with a horn-coloured cere.

Black-shouldered kites spiral into the wind like a kestrel. They soar with V-shaped up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned, giving the tail a squarer appearance and visible &#x27;fingers&#x27; on the wings. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern has been described as &#x27;winnowing&#x27; with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.

The black-shouldered kite is very similar to the related letter-winged kite (&quot;E. scriptus&quot;), but has the black mark above and behind the eye, a white rather than grey crown, and shows all-white underparts in flight except for the black markings on the shoulder, dark wingtips, and a small black patch on the underwing. It is slightly larger than the nankeen kestrel (&quot;Falco cenchroides&quot;). The latter species lacks wing markings and has pale brown plumage. It keeps its wings level when soaring, and has a faster wingbeat when hovering. The grey falcon (&quot;Falco hypoleucos&quot;) has somewhat similar coloration to the black-shouldered kite but is bulkier and heavier overall and lacks the black markings. Its wings are barred, and it preys on birds. The grey goshawk (&quot;Accipiter novaehollandiae&quot;) has wider more rounded wings, underwing markings and glides with lowered wings.

===Vocalisations===
The black-shouldered kite is generally silent, except in the breeding season when its calls, though weak, can be persistent. It primarily utters a clear whistled &quot;chee, chee, chee&quot; call in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing &quot;skree-ah&quot; when perched. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by the female and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.

A variety of different calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were made when a bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration &quot;chatter&quot; calls were given when a bird sighted a human near the enclosure.

==Distribution and habitat==

Black-shouldered kites may be sedentary or nomadic and are generally found in open grasslands or valleys where there are scattered clumps of trees, where the grass or groundcover is accessible from the air and ranges from 30 cm to 1.5 m (1–5 ft) high. As well as native grasslands they forage over pastures, cereal or vegetable crops and vineyards, often focusing on areas that have been recently harvested or ploughed and hence rendering prey more exposed. In urban areas, they are encountered on the edge of towns on wasteland, irregularly mown areas, sports fields, golf courses or grassy roadside verges. They also hunt over coastal dunes and drier marshland, but avoid areas with dense cover such as forest as well as bare or rocky ground.

Their numbers fluctuate during drought and floods and can be irruptive in response to sudden increases in mouse populations. The most distant banding recovery was from the Red Banks area in South Australia to Lithgow in eastern New South Wales three and a half years later, a distance of .

Although reported throughout Australia, they are most common in the relatively fertile south-east and south-west corners of the mainland, and in south-east Queensland. They are rare in the deep desert and dryer areas such as western Cape York or the Northern Territory, and are occasional visitors to northern Tasmania, King Island, and the Torres Strait islands.

==Behaviour==

Black-shouldered kites usually hunt singly or in pairs, though where food is plentiful they occur in small family groups and can be loosely gregarious at times of irruptions, with up to 70 birds reported feeding together during a mouse plague. They roost communally, like other &quot;Elanus&quot; species. They are territorial when food is not abundant. The practice of &quot;tail flicking&quot; where, on landing, the tail is flicked up and lowered and the movement repeated persistently is thought to be a possible territorial display.

===Breeding===

Aerial courtship displays involve single and mutual high circling flight, and the male may fly around with wings held high rapidly fluttering, known as flutter-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male&#x27;s talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.

Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs. The breeding season is usually August to January, but is responsive to mice populations, and some pairs breed twice in a good season. Both sexes collect material for the nest but the female alone builds it. A large untidy shallow cup of sticks usually in the foliage near the top of trees, the nest takes anywhere from two to six weeks to be built. It is constructed of thin twigs and is around across when newly built, but growing to around across and deep after repeated use. The nest is lined with green leaves and felted fur, though linings of grass and cow dung have also been reported. It is generally located in the canopy of an isolated or exposed tree in open country, elevated or more above the ground. Black-shouldered kites have been known to use old Australian magpie, crow or raven nests.

Females perform most of the care of eggs and nestlings, though males take a minor share of incubation and brooding. The clutch consists of three to four dull white eggs of a tapered oval shape measuring and with red-brown blotches that are often heavier around the larger end of the egg. The eggs are laid at intervals of two to five days. The female incubates the eggs for 30 days and when the eggs hatch the chicks are helpless but have soft down covering their body. For the first two weeks or so the female broods the chicks constantly, both day and night. She does no hunting at all for the first three weeks after hatching, but calls to the male from the nest, and he generally responds by bringing food. The female feeds the chicks with the mice brought back to the nest by the male, feeding them in tiny pieces for the first week or two, at which time the chicks are capable of swallowing a mouse whole. The nestling period lasts around 36 days, and the post-fledging period at least 36 days with parental feeding for at least 22 days. When the chicks are older both parents take it in turns to feed them. Black feathers start to appear along the chicks&#x27; wings when they are about a fortnight old, and they are fully fledged and are ready to fly in five weeks. Within a week of leaving the nest the young birds are capable of hunting for mice on their own.

Juveniles disperse widely, taking up territory that can be as far as from the nest site.

===Food and hunting===

The black-shouldered kite has become a specialist predator of the introduced house mouse, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. It takes other suitably-sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of its diet. Its influence on mouse populations is probably significant; adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.

Like other elanid kites, the black-shouldered kite hunts by quartering grasslands for small creatures. This can be from a perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. It is diurnal, preferring to hunt during the day, particularly in the early morning and mid to late afternoon, and occasionally hunts in pairs. Its hunting pattern, outside breeding periods and periods of abundant prey, has distinct crepuscular peaks, perhaps corresponding to mouse activity. When hunting, the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Unlike the nankeen kestrel, the black-winged kite shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a strong breeze. One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Typically, a kite hovers above a particular spot, peering down intently, sometimes for only a few seconds, often for a minute or more, then glides swiftly to a new vantage point and hovers again. When hunting from a perch, a dead tree is the preferred platform. Like other &quot;Elanus&quot; kites, the black-shouldered kite grips a vertical branch with a foot on either side, each one above the other and turned inwards, which enables them to maintain a secure footing on relatively small branches. Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour.

When a mouse or other prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; sometimes in one long drop to ground level, more often in two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.

==Conservation status==
The arrival of Europeans to Australia has, on the whole, benefited the black-shouldered kite through land clearing, irrigation for agriculture, grain harvesting, and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much larger numbers of mice. As the species has a large range and an increasing population, it is listed as &quot;Least Concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species. In southwestern Australia, it has become one of the most commonly recorded raptors in the wheatbelt. According to raptor researcher Stephen Debus, this species did not suffer from eggshell thinning during the period of DDT use in Australia, though he believes secondary poisoning is possible from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.

<text>Pascual de Gayangos y Arce (June 21, 1809 – October 4, 1897) was a Spanish scholar and orientalist.

==Life==
Born in Seville, Gayangos was the son of Brigadier José de Gayangos, intendente of Zacatecas, in New Spain (Mexico). After completing his primary education in Madrid, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to school at Pont-le-Voy near Blois. There, he began the study of Arabic in the École spéciale des Langues orientales of Paris under Silvestre de Sacy.

Gayangos visited Britain, where he married Frances, daughter of Henry Revell, in 1828. He then obtained a post in the Spanish treasury, and was transferred to the foreign office as translator in 1833.

In 1837, Gayangos returned to Britain, wrote extensively in British periodicals, like &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, and in publications of the SDUK, like &quot;The Penny Cyclopaedia for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge&quot; and &quot;The Biographical Dictionary&quot;. In these years he completed his magnum opus as an arabist: the translation, for the Royal Asiatic Society, of the first part of Al Makkari&#x27;s biography of Ibn al-Khatib. The edition was entitled the &quot;History of the Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain&quot; and appeared in two volumes in 1840 and 1843 . While in England, he entered in the Holland House circle, where he made the acquaintance of George Ticknor, to whom he was very helpful. In 1843, he returned to Spain as professor of Arabic at the University of Madrid, a post he held until 1871. In 1861, the American Philosophical Society elected him an international Member. He entered in politics in 1881, when he was made director of public instruction. He resigned on being elected senator for the district of Huelva.

His latter years were spent in cataloguing the Spanish manuscripts in the British Museum; he had previously continued Gustav Adolf Bergenroth&#x27;s catalogue of the manuscripts relating to the negotiations between England and Spain in the Simancas archives. His best-known original work is his lengthy introduction on Spanish romances of chivalry in volume 40 (&quot;Libros de caballerías&quot;, vol. 1, 1857) of Adolfo Rivadeneyra&#x27;s &quot;Biblioteca de autores españoles&quot;. This was the first survey of Spanish chivalric romances.

Gayangos died in London.

<text>Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad al-Maqqarī al-Tilmisānī (or al-Maḳḳarī) (), (1577-1632) was an Algerian scholar, biographer and historian who is best known for his , a compendium of the history of Al-Andalus which provided a basis for the scholarly research on the subject until the twentieth century.

==Life==
A native of Tlemcen and from a prominent intellectual family originally from the village of Maqqara, near M&#x27;sila in Algeria. After his early education in Tlemcen, al-Maqqari travelled to Fes in Morocco and then to Marrakesh, following the court of Ahmad al-Mansur. On al-Mansur&#x27;s death in 1603, al-Maqqari established himself in Fes, where he was the imam of the Qarawiyyin Mosque.

In 1617, he left for the East, possibly following a quarrel with the local ruler, and took up residence in Cairo, where he composed his best known work, &quot;Nafḥ al-ṭīb&quot;.

In 1620, he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and made five pilgrimages over six years. At Mecca and Medina he gave popular lectures on ḥadīth. In 1628, he was again in Damascus, where he continued his lectures on Muhammad al-Bukhari&#x27;s collection of Ḥadīth (&#x27;Traditions&#x27;), and spoke much of the glories of Muslim Iberia, and received the impulse to write his work on this subject later. That year he returned to Cairo and spent a year in writing his history of Spain. Surviving manuscripts are now held in part at El Escorial, near Madrid. He died in 1632 during preparations to settle in Damascus.

<doc id="262185" wikidata="Q241026" url="?curid=262185" title="Muhammad al-Bukhari">
<text>Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Ismāʿīl ibn Ibrāhīm al-Juʿfī al-Bukhārī (; 21 July 810 – 1 September 870) was a 9th-century Persian Muslim &quot;muhaddith&quot; who is widely regarded as the most important &quot;hadith&quot; scholar in the history of Sunni Islam. Al-Bukhari&#x27;s extant works include the &quot;hadith&quot; collection &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot;, &quot;al-Tarikh al-Kabir&quot;, and &quot;al-Adab al-Mufrad&quot;.

Born in Bukhara in present-day Uzbekistan, Al-Bukhari began learning &quot;hadith&quot; at a young age. He travelled across the Abbasid Caliphate and learned under several influential contemporary scholars. Bukhari memorized thousands of &quot;hadith&quot; narrations, compiling the &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; in 846. He spent the rest of his life teaching the &quot;hadith&quot; he had collected. Towards the end of his life, Bukhari faced claims the Quran was created, and was exiled from Nishapur. Subsequently, he moved to Khartank, near Samarkand.

&quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; is revered as the most important &quot;hadith&quot; collection in Sunni Islam. &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; and &quot;Sahih Muslim,&quot; the &quot;hadith&quot; collection of Al-Bukhari&#x27;s student Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, are together known as the Sahihayn () and are regarded by Sunnis as the most authentic books after the Quran. It is part of the Kutub al-Sittah, the six most highly regarded collections of &quot;hadith&quot; in Sunni Islam.

== Life ==

=== Ancestry and early life ===
Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari al-Ju&#x27;fi was born after the Friday prayer on Friday, 21 July 810 (13 Shawwal 194 AH) in the city of Bukhara in Greater Khorasan in present-day Uzbekistan. He was of Persian descent and his father was Ismail ibn Ibrahim, a scholar of hadith and a student of Malik ibn Anas, Abd Allah ibn al-Mubarak, and Hammad ibn Salamah. Ismail died while Al-Bukhari was an infant. Al-Bukhari&#x27;s great-grandfather, Al-Mughirah, settled in Bukhara after accepting Islam at the hands of Bukhara&#x27;s governor, Yaman al-Ju&#x27;fi. As was the custom, he became a &quot;mawla&quot; of Yaman, and his family continued to carry the &quot;nisba&quot; &quot;al-Ju&#x27;fi.&quot;

Al-Mughirah&#x27;s father, Bardizbah (), is the earliest known ancestor of Al-Bukhari according to most scholars and historians. Bardizbah was a Zoroastrian Magi. Taqi al-Din al-Subki is the only scholar to name Bardizbah&#x27;s father, who he says was named Bazzabah (). Little is known of both of them except that they were Persian and followed the religion of their people. Historians have also not come across any information on Al-Bukhari&#x27;s grandfather, Ibrahim ibn al-Mughirah ().

=== Travels and education ===
According to contemporary hadith scholar and historian Al-Dhahabi, al-Bukhari began studying hadith in the Hijri year 821 CE. He memorized the works of Abd Allah ibn al-Mubarak while still a child and began writing and narrating hadith while still an adolescent. In the Hijri year 826 CE, at the age of sixteen, Al-Bukhari performed the &quot;Hajj&quot; with his elder brother and widowed mother. Al-Bukhari stayed in Mecca for two years, before moving to Medina where he wrote &quot;Qadhāyas-Sahābah wa at-Tābi&#x27;īn,&quot; a book about the companions of Muhammad and the &quot;tabi&#x27;un.&quot; He also wrote &quot;Al-Tārīkh al-Kabīr&quot; during his time in Medina.

Al-Bukhari is known to have travelled to most of the important Islamic learning centres of his time, including Syria, Kufa, Basra, Egypt, Yemen, and Baghdad. He studied under prominent Islamic scholars including Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ali ibn al-Madini, Yahya ibn Ma&#x27;in and Ishaq ibn Rahwayh. Al-Bukhari is known to have memorized over 600,000 &quot;hadith&quot; narrations.

=== &quot;Mihna&quot;, later years and death ===

According to Jonathan Brown, following Ibn Hanbal, Al-Bukhari had reportedly declared that &#x27;reciting the Quran is an element of createdness’. Through this assertion, Al-Bukhari had sought an alternative response to the doctrines of Mu&#x27;tazilites and declared that the element of creation is applied only to humans, not the Word of God. His statements were received negatively by prominent &quot;hadith&quot; scholars and he was driven out of Nishapur. Al-Bukhari, however, had only referred to the human action of reading the Qur’an, when he reportedly stated &quot;My recitation of the Quran is created&quot;&quot;&quot; (). Al-Dhahabi and al-Subki asserted that Al-Bukhari was expelled due to the jealousy of certain scholars of Nishapur. Al-Bukhari spent the last twenty-four years of his life teaching the &quot;hadith&quot; he had collected. During the &quot;mihna&quot;, he fled to Khartank, a village near Samarkand, where he then also died on Friday, 1 September 870. Today his tomb lies within the Imam Bukhari Mausoleum in Hartang, Uzbekistan, 25 kilometers from Samarkand. It was restored in 1998 after centuries of neglect and dilapidation. The mausoleum complex consists of Al-Bukhari&#x27;s tomb, a mosque, a madrasa, library, and a small collection of Qurans. The modern ground-level mausoleum tombstone of Al-Bukhari is only a cenotaph, the actual grave lies within a small crypt below the structure.

== Works ==

&quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; is considered Al-Bukhari&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. It is a collection of approximately 7,563 &quot;hadith&quot; narrations across 97 chapters creating a basis for a complete system of jurisprudence without the use of speculative law. The book is highly regarded among Sunni Muslims, and most Sunni scholars consider it second only to the Quran in terms of authenticity. It is considered one of the most authentic collection of hadith, even ahead of &quot;Muwatta Imam Malik&quot; and &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot;. Alongside the latter, &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; is known as one of the &quot;&#x27;Sahihayn&quot; (Two &quot;Sahihs&quot;)&#x27; and they are together part of the Kutub al-Sittah. One of the most famous stories from the &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; is the story of Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation.

Al-Bukhari wrote three works discussing narrators of hadith with respect to their ability in conveying their material. These are &quot;Al-Tārīkh al-Kabīr&quot;, &quot;Al-Tarīkh al-Awsaţ&quot;, and &quot;Al-Tarīkh al-Ṣaghīr.&quot; Of these, &quot;Al-Tārīkh al-Kabīr&quot; is published and well-known, while Al-Tarīkh al-Ṣaghīr is lost. Al-Dhahabi quotes Al-Bukhari as having said, “When I turned eighteen years old, I began writing about the companions and the &quot;tabi&#x27;un&quot; and their statements. [...] At that time I also authored a book of history at the grave of the Prophet at night during a full moon.&quot; The books being referred to here were &quot;Qadhāyas-Sahābah wa at-Tābi&#x27;īn&quot; and &quot;Al-Tārīkh al-Kabīr.&quot; Al-Bukhari also wrote al-Kunā on patronymics, and Al-Ḍu&#x27;afā al-Ṣaghīr on weak narrators of hadith. Al-Adab al-Mufrad is a collection of hadith narrations on ethics and manners.

In response to the accusations levied against him during his &quot;mihna&quot;, Al-Bukhari compiled the treatise &quot;Khalq Af&#x27;āl al-&#x27;Ibād&quot;, the earliest traditionalist representation of the position taken by Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in which Al-Bukhari explains that the Quran is God&#x27;s uncreated speech, while maintaining that God creates human actions, as the Sunnis had insisted in their attacks on the free-will position of Qadariyah. The first section of the book reports narrations from earlier scholars such as Sufyan al-Thawri that affirmed the Sunni doctrine of the uncreated nature of the Quran and condemned anyone who held the contrary position as a &quot;Jahmi&quot; or &quot;Kāfir&quot;. The second section asserts that the acts of men are created, relying on Qur&#x27;anic verses and reports from earlier traditionalist scholars like Yahya ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Qatlan. In the last part of his treatise, Al-Bukhari harshly condemned the &quot;Mutazilites&quot;, defending the belief that sound of the Qur&#x27;an being recited is created. Al-Bukhari cited Ahmad Ibn Hanbal as evidence for his position, re-affirming the latter&#x27;s legacy and the former&#x27;s allegiance to the &quot;Ahl al-Hadith.&quot;&quot;&quot;

== School of law ==
In terms of law, scholars like Jonathan Brown assert that al-Bukhari was of the &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot;, an adherent of Ahmad ibn Hanbal&#x27;s traditionalist school in law (fiqh), but fell victim to its most radical wing due to misunderstandings. This claim is supported by Hanbalis, although members of the Shafi&#x27;i and Ẓāhirī schools levy this claim as well. Scott Lucas argues that al-Bukhari&#x27;s legal positions were similar to those of the Ẓāhirīs and Hanbalis of his time, suggesting al-Bukhari rejected &quot;qiyas&quot; and other forms of &quot;ra&#x27;y&quot; completely. Many are of the opinion that Al-Bukhari was a &quot;mujtahid&quot; with his own &quot;madhhab&quot;. Munir Ahmad asserts that historically most jurists considered him to be a &quot;muhaddith&quot; (scholar of &quot;hadith&quot;) and not a &quot;faqīh&quot; (jurist), and that as a &quot;muhaddith,&quot; he followed the Shafi&#x27;i school. The Harvard historian Ahmed el-Shamsy also asserts this, as he states that he was a student of the Shafi&#x27;i scholar (d. 245/859).

== Theology ==
According to some scholars, such as Christopher Melchert, and also Ash&#x27;ari theologians, including Ibn Hajar al-&#x27;Asqalani and al-Bayhaqi, al-Bukhari was a follower of the Kullabi school of Sunni theology due to his position on the &quot;utterance&quot; of the Quran being created. Other Kullabis, such as al-Harith al-Muhasibi, were harassed and made to relocate, a similar situation al-Bukhari found himself towards the latter years of his life by other Hanbalis. He was also known to be a student of (d. 245/859), who was a direct student of Imam al-Shafi&#x27;i from his period in Iraq. Al-Karabisi was also known to have associated himself directly with Ibn Kullab and the Kullabi school of thought.

A significant number of scholars, both historical and contemporary, maintain that al-Bukhari was an independent mujtahid and did not adhere to any of the four famous madhhabs. Al-Dhahabi said that: Imam Bukhari was a mujtahid, a scholar capable of making his own ijtihad without following any Islamic school of jurisprudence in particular.

=== Interpretation of God&#x27;s attributes ===
According to Namira Nahouza in her work &#x27;Wahhabism and the Rise of the New Salafists&#x27;, al-Bukhari in his Sahih, in the book entitled &quot;Tafsir al-Qur&#x27;an wa &#x27;ibaratih&quot; [i.e., Exegesis of the Qur&#x27;an and its expressions], surat al-Qasas, verse 88: &quot;kullu shay&#x27;in halikun illa Wajhah&quot; [the literal meaning of which is &quot;everything will perish except His Face&quot;], he said the term [illa Wajhah] means: &quot;except His Sovereignty/Dominance&quot;. And there is [in this same chapter] other than that in terms of ta&#x27;wil (metaphorical interpretation), like the term &#x27;dahk&#x27; () which is narrated in a hadith, [which is interpreted by] His Mercy.

=== Views on predestination ===
Al-Bukhari also rebuked those who rejected of &quot;qadar&quot; (predestination) in &quot;Sahih al-Bukhari&quot; by quoting a verse of the Qur&#x27;an implying that God had precisely determined all human acts. According to Ibn Hajar al-&#x27;Asqalani, al-Bukhari signified that if someone was to accept autonomy in creating his acts, he would be assumed to be playing God&#x27;s role and so would subsequently be declared a &quot;Mushrik,&quot; similar to the later Ash&#x27;ari view of &quot;kasb&quot; (acquisition, occasionalism, and causality, which link human action with divine omnipotence). In another chapter, al-Bukhari refutes the creeds of the Kharijites. According to Badr al-Din al-&#x27;Ayni, the heading of that chapter was designed not only to refute the Kharijites but any who held similar beliefs.

<text>The Western Province ( &quot;Basnāhira Paḷāta&quot;; &quot;Mael Mākāṇam&quot;) is one of the nine provinces of Sri Lanka, the first level administrative division of the country. The provinces have existed since the 19th century but did not have any legal status until 1987 when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils. Western Province is the most densely populated province in the country and is home to the legislative capital Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte as well as to Colombo, the nation&#x27;s administrative and business center.

==History==
Parts of present-day Western Province were part of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Kotte. The province then came under Portuguese, Dutch and British control. In 1815 the British gained control of the entire island of Ceylon. They divided the island into three ethnic based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. The Western Province was part of the Low Country Sinhalese administration. In 1833, in accordance with the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission, the ethnic based administrative structures were unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. The districts of Chilaw, Colombo, Kalutara, Puttalam, Seven Korales (present day Kurunegala District), Three Korales, Four Korales and Lower Bulatgama (present day Kegalle District) formed the new Western Province. Chilaw District, Puttalam District and Seven Korales were transferred to the newly created North Western Province in 1845. Three Korales, Four Korales and Lower Bulatgama were transferred to the newly created Sabaragamuwa Province in 1889.

It is planned to create a planned Megacity under the Western Region Megapolis Plan in the Western Province designed by Surbana. Originally initiated in 2004 by Ranil Wickremesinghe it was stopped after his election defeat and was restarted again after his return to power in 2015. The project plans to merge Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts and introduce zoning.

==Geography and climate==
Western Province is located in the southwest of Sri Lanka. It has an area of , making it the smallest of the country&#x27;s nine provinces. The province is surrounded by the Laccadive Sea to the west, North Western Province to the north, Sabaragamuwa Province to the east and the Southern Province to the south.

The Western Province is vulnerable to recurrent flooding as a result of an increase in average rainfall coupled with heavier rainfall events, with knock-on impacts on the infrastructure, utility supply, and the urban economy of the Province. As the most urbanised province in Sri Lanka, these climate events pose a number of problems due to the rapid urban growth the province has undergone.

Agriculture only made up 1.7% of the GDP the lowest among the nine provinces while Industrial sector made up 34.6% the highest in the country and service sector represented 56.5%.

The province is undergoing rapid development with several of the largest infrastructure development projects happening in the province such as the Colombo International Financial City(CIFC) which is an International Financial Zone and the Western Region Megapolis Planning Project(WRMPP) Western province is also undergoing a major real estate and construction boom with residential and commercial buildings and skyscrapers changing the skylines of cities such as Colombo and Rajagiriya.

The Colombo Harbour is also a major driver of economic growth being the busiest port in South Asia. It has both privately run and state owned terminals and is being expanded.

Almost all the premier educational institutions in the island are located in the Western Province. Universities in the province includes the University of Colombo, University of Kelaniya, University of Moratuwa, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Open University, Sri Lanka, Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, National Institute of Business Management and the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology.

<doc id="262201" wikidata="Q48989" url="?curid=262201" title="ZDF">
<text>ZDF (), short for (; ), is a German public-service television broadcaster based in Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate. Launched on 1 April 1963, it is run as an independent nonprofit institution, and was founded by all federal states of Germany (). ZDF is financed by television licence fees and advertising revenues.

The broadcaster is well known for its famous programmes , a newscast established in 1963, and , an entertainment show that premiered in 1981, with a suspension from 2014 to 2021. Norbert Himmler, ZDF&#x27;s director general, was elected by the ZDF Television Council in 2021.

== History ==


In 1959, the government of Konrad Adenauer began preparations to form a second nationwide television network with the intention of competing with ARD. Adenauer perceived ARD&#x27;s news coverage to be too critical of his government, and believed that two of the organizations primarily responsible for its news reporting – the &quot;Deutsche Presse-Agentur&quot; and &quot;Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk&quot;, which produced the nightly &quot;Tagesschau&quot; – were too close to the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) to ever be able to report neutrally on his Christian Democratic Union government. The new television company called the &quot;Freies Fernsehen Gesellschaft&quot; (Free Television Society) but derisively called &quot;Adenauer-Fernsehen&quot; (Adenauer&#x27;s television) by critics, was founded on 25 July 1960.

The Deutsche Bundespost began constructing a second transmitter network on UHF channels, which required new reception equipment. For older receivers, a converter was sold for about 80 DM (). As with the earlier ARD television network, the location of the transmitters was carefully planned to ensure the entire country would be able to receive the programming.

To test the transmitters and encourage the public to purchase UHF receivers, the federal government allowed the ARD network to create a temporary secondary channel, ARD 2, which was broadcast daily from 8 to 10 p.m. ARD 2 began broadcasting on 1 May 1961 in the transmission area of Hessischer Rundfunk and a month later expanded nationwide.

=== Interstate agreement ===
The SPD-led states of Hamburg, Bremen, Lower Saxony, and Hesse appealed to the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which on 28 February 1961 in the &quot;First Broadcasting Judgment&quot; blocked the plan. While building and maintaining telecommunications infrastructure, such as television transmitters, is a responsibility of the federal government under article 87f of the Basic Law, the constitution does not extend these duties to running a television or radio broadcaster. Under Article 30, any power or duty not explicitly assigned to the federal government is reserved for the states. Therefore, the court ruled only the states had the right to set up a television broadcaster. (Conversely, the same decision supported new longwave broadcaster Deutschlandfunk, which had been established by the federal government in November 1960; its focus was on external broadcasting and therefore under the federal government&#x27;s remit to conduct foreign relations.)

After this decision, in March 1961, the states decided to establish a central nonprofit public television network independently of Adenauer&#x27;s effort. On 6 June 1961, the state premiers signed at a premiers&#x27; conference in Stuttgart the interstate agreement on the &quot;establishment of the public institution &quot;Second German Television&quot;&quot;. On 1 December 1961, though not all states had ratified the agreement, it went into force in the states that had done so (Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate). The last state, Bavaria, filed the instrument of ratification on 9 July 1962.

=== Launch ===
The station began broadcasting from Eschborn near Frankfurt am Main on 1 April 1963, with a speech by the first director general (Intendant), Karl Holzamer. The channel broadcast its first programme in colour in 1967. In 1974, ZDF moved its base of operations to Mainz-Lerchenberg, after briefly being located in Wiesbaden. Since 5 October 1996, ZDF has broadcast 24 hours a day.
== Finances ==
ZDF is financed by a license fee of €18.36 per month, which must be paid by all households in Germany except handicapped people and persons on social aid. ZDF shares the income with ARD and Deutschlandradio. The fees are not collected directly by ZDF but by the Beitragsservice (commonly known by its former name, GEZ), an organization comprising the ARD member broadcasters, ZDF, and Deutschlandradio. ZDF also receives income from sponsorships, programming and advertising sales.

== Editorial independence ==

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated ZDF to be &quot;Independent Public Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== Transmission and reception ==

=== Terrestrial ===
As ZDF is a station, not a network, the station is broadcast throughout Germany, with no regional variations or affiliates, using a number of signal repeaters. ZDF transmitters broadcast a digital signal. Analog signals were gradually phased out, a process which lasted from 2002 to 2008. ZDF does not run any transmitters itself. Throughout the analogue days, all ZDF transmitters were run by the Deutsche Bundespost which was later privatised as Deutsche Telekom&#x27;s subsidiary T-Systems Media Broadcast. (This is in contrast to the other public German broadcaster, ARD, which owns its main transmitters.) ZDF was not previously allowed to use ARD&#x27;s transmitters. ZDF has used both ARD and Telekom transmitters since changes to the law in the 1990s, and since the digital switchover.

=== Cable ===
ZDF has also been relayed by cable since the days of the first cable pilot projects.

=== Satellite ===
The first Europe-wide satellite broadcast via Astra 1C began in August 1993 during the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin (IFA – &quot;International Broadcasting Exhibition&quot;) in Berlin. In the same decade, these new technologies were used to enable digital broadcasting of ZDF. Today, ZDF is available free-to-air throughout Europe on Astra 19.2°E.

ZDF operates two digital channels: ZDFneo (aimed at 18- to 45-year-olds) and ZDFinfo (documentaries). Both are transmitted in SD and HD. A commercial subsidiary called ZDF Studios GmbH manages programme sales, acquisitions, international coproductions, and a growing number of important activities in new media. ZDF Enterprises owns a Dutch TV production and distribution company, Off the Fence. ZDF also operates various channels in cooperation with other networks: Arte, 3sat, KI.KA, and Phoenix.

== Design ==

ZDF&#x27;s animated station-identity mascots, the &quot;Mainzelmännchen&quot; (a play on the words &quot;Mainz&quot; and &quot;Heinzelmännchen&quot;), created by Wolf Gerlach for the channel&#x27;s launch in 1963, quickly became popular and are still shown between commercials. In 1976, Otl Aicher, a graphic designer, created ZDF&#x27;s corporate design. A new design for ZDF was created by Lee Hunt in February 2000.

== Administration ==

=== Director general ===

Administratively, ZDF is headed by a director general (&quot;Intendant&quot;), who is elected by the ZDF Television Council, the composition of which is in turn determined by &quot;societally relevant groups&quot; named in the ZDF Treaty.

* Five representatives of the federal states
* One representative of the federal republic of Germany

=== Television board ===

== Membership ==
ZDF became a full member of the European Broadcasting Union in 1963. It also has numerous individual cooperation agreements with broadcasters around the world. ZDF is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV initiative which promotes the establishment of an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface.

<text>Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi (;‎ (631A.H-676A.H) (October 1230–21 December 1277) was a Sunni Shafi&#x27;ite jurist and hadith scholar. Al-Nawawi died at the relatively early age of 45. Despite this, he authored numerous and lengthy works ranging from hadith, to theology, biography, and jurisprudence that are still read to this day. Al-Nawawi, along with Abu al-Qasim al-Rafi&#x27;i, are leading jurists of the earlier classical age, known by the Shafi&#x27;i school as the Two Shaykhs (&quot;al-Shaykhayn&quot;).

==Early life==

He was born at Nawa near Damascus, Syria. As with Arabic and other Semitic languages, the last part of his name refers to his hometown.

Yasin bin Yusuf Marakashi, says: &quot;I saw Imam Nawawi at Nawa when he was a youth of ten years of age. Other boys of his age used to force him to play with them, but Imam Nawawi would always avoid the play and would remain busy with the recitation of the Noble Qur&#x27;an. When they tried to domineer and insisted on his joining their games, he bewailed and expressed his no concern over their foolish action. On observing his sagacity and profundity, a special love and affection developed in my heart for young Nawawi. I approached his teacher and urged him to take exceptional care of this lad as he was to become a great religious scholar. His teacher asked whether I was a soothsayer or an astrologer. I told him I am neither soothsayer nor an astrologer but Allah caused me to utter these words.&quot; His teacher conveyed this incident to Imam&#x27;s father and in keeping in view the learning quest of his son, decided to dedicate the life of his son for the service and promotion of the cause of Islam.

==Life as a scholar==
He studied in Damascus from the age of 18 and after making the pilgrimage in 1253, he settled there as a private scholar.

===Notable teachers===
During his stay at Damascus, he studied from more than twenty teachers who were regarded as masters and authority of their subject field and disciplines they taught. An-Nawawi studied Hadith, Islamic Jurisprudence, its principles, syntax and Etymology. His teachers included Abu Ibrahim Ishaq bin Ahmad AI-Maghribi, Abu Muhammad Abdur-Rahman bin Ibrahim Al-Fazari, Radiyuddin Abu Ishaq Ibrahim bin Abu Hafs Umar bin Mudar Al-Mudari, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim bin Isa Al-Muradi, Abul-Baqa Khalid bin Yusuf An-Nablusi, Abul-Abbas Ahmad bin Salim Al-Misri, Abu Abdullah Al-Jiyani, Abul-Fath Umar bin Bandar, Abu Muhammad At-Tanukhi, Sharafuddin Abdul-Aziz bin Muhammad Al-Ansari, Abul-Faraj Abdur-Rahman bin Muhammad bin Ahmad Al-Maqdisi, and Abul-Fada&#x27;il Sallar bin Al-Hasan Al Arbali among others.

== Creed ==
He did ta&#x27;wil on some of the Qur&#x27;an verses and ahadith on the attributes of Allah. He states in his commentary of a hadith that:

== Relationship with Baybars ==
Al-Nawawi drew the ire of Mamluk Sultan Rukn al-Din Baybars twice. Once, at a time when the people of Damascus sought relief from a heavy tax burden after a years-long drought, Al-Nawawi wrote that if Baybars did not stop taxing its residents abusively then Allah will tax his misdeed in the afterlife. This prompted Baybars to threaten to expel him from Damascus. To this, he responded:&quot;As for myself, threats do not harm me or mean anything to me. They will not keep me from advising the ruler, for I believe that this is obligatory upon me and others.&quot;

Sheikh Navaid Aziz stated a popular tale of when Al-Nawawi addressed Sultan Baybars when the latter wanted the ulama to issue a fatwa that decreed that the waqf be collected solely for the ruler, despite originally being meant for the people. Al-Nawawi in response scolded him, urging him to fear Allah and rein in his greed, which the Sultan accepted. Some people asked Baybars why he did not imprison Al-Nawawi in retaliation, to which Baybars replied that whenever he thought of locking up Al-Nawawi, a fear flowed through his heart. In both encounters, Baybars abided by Al-Nawawi&#x27;s counsel.

==Death and legacy==
In the last third of the night of Wednesday, 25 Rajab 676 AH, corresponding to 22 December, 1277 AD, Al-Nawawi passed away at relatively young age of 45. He was buried the next morning.

An-Nawawi&#x27;s lasting legacy is his contribution to hadith literature through his momentous works Forty Hadiths and Riyadh as-Saaliheen. This made him respected in all madhabs, despite him being of Shafi&#x27;i jurisprudence. According to Al-Dhahabi, Imam Nawawi&#x27;s concentration and absorption in academic love gained proverbial fame. He had devoted all his time for learning and scholarship. Other than reading and writing, he spent his time contemplating on the interacted and complex issues and in finding their solutions. Ulama&#x27;s praise him for 3 characteristics:

# His level of scholarship. Writing more than 40 pages daily from age 18-45. Studying continuously for 12 hours and then teaching for another 12 hours at age 18-20 in Damascus.
# His asceticism. Not marrying in fear of faltering his wife&#x27;s right, lack of love for dunya, constant worshipping of Allah, constant zikr.
# His keenness in enjoining good and forbidding evil. As done with Sultan al-Baibars.

===Destruction of tomb===
In 2015, during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, his tomb was demolished by rebels linked to Al Nusra.

<doc id="262205" wikidata="Q10809431" url="?curid=262205" title="Psophia">
<text>Psophia is a genus of birds restricted to the humid forests of the Amazon and Guiana Shield in South America. It is the only genus in the family Psophiidae. Birds in the genus are commonly known as trumpeters, due to the trumpeting or cackling threat call of the males. The three species resemble slightly taller, longer-legged chickens in size and appearance; they measure long and weigh . They are rotund birds with long, flexible necks and legs, downward-curving bills and a “hunched” appearance. Their heads are small, but their eyes are relatively large, making them look inquisitive and &quot;good-natured&quot;. The plumage is soft, resembling fur or velvet on the head and neck. It is mostly black, with purple, green, or bronze iridescence, particularly on the wing coverts and the lower neck. In the best-known taxa, the secondary and tertial flight feathers are white, grey, or greenish-black and hairlike, falling over the lower back, which is the same colour. These colours give the three generally accepted species their names.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The genus &quot;Psophia&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, as containing a single species, the grey-winged trumpeter (&quot;Psophia crepitans&quot;). The genus name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;psophos&quot; meaning &quot;noise&quot;.

The genus&#x27; taxonomy is far from settled; anywhere from three to six species (with varying numbers of subspecies) are recognized by different taxonomic systems.

The International Ornithological Committee&#x27;s treatment is the most conservative. They recognize three species, two of which have three subspecies:

* Grey-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia crepitans&quot;
** &quot;P. c. crepitans&quot;
** &quot;P. c. napensis&quot;
** &quot;P. c. ochroptera&quot;
* Pale-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia leucoptera&quot;
* Dark-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia viridis&quot;
** &quot;P. v. viridis&quot;
** &quot;P. v. dextralis&quot;
** &quot;P. v. obscura&quot;

The Clements taxonomy splits &quot;P. v. dextralis&quot; and adds English names to the subspecies:

* Gray-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia crepitans&quot;
** &quot;P. c. crepitans&quot; (gray-winged)
** &quot;P. c. napensis&quot; (Napo)
** &quot;P. c. ochroptera&quot; (ochre-winged)
* Pale-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia leucoptera&quot;
* Dark-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia viridis&quot;
** &quot;P. v. viridis&quot; (green-backed)
** &quot;P. v. dextralis&quot; (dusky-backed)
** &quot;P. v. interjecta&quot; (Xingu)
** &quot;P. v. obscura&quot; (black-backed)

BirdLife International&#x27;s Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) recognizes six species:

* Grey-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia crepitans&quot;
** &quot;P. c. crepitans&quot;
** &quot;P. c. napensis&quot;
* Ochre-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia ochroptera&quot;
* White-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia leucoptera&quot;
* Green-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia viridis&quot;
* Olive-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia dextralis&quot;
** &quot;P. d. dextralis&quot;
** &quot;P. d. interjecta&quot;
* Black-winged trumpeter, &quot;Psophia obscura&quot;

Traditionally, only three species of trumpeters have been recognised. A 2008 review, of the morphology of the dark-winged trumpeter, resulted in the recommendation that it be divided into three species. A 2010 review of the phylogeny and biogeography of all members of the family resulted in a suggested total of eight species—two in the grey-winged trumpeter complex, two in the pale-winged trumpeter complex, and four in the dark-winged trumpeter complex.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Trumpeters fly weakly but run fast; they can easily outrun dogs. They are also capable of swimming across rivers. They spend most of the day in noisy flocks, sometimes numbering more than 100, on the forest floor. They feed on fallen fruit (particularly fruit knocked down by monkeys). They also eat a small amount of arthropods, including ants and flies, and even some reptiles and amphibians. At night they fly with difficulty into trees to roost above the ground.

Trumpeters nest in a hole in a tree or in the crown of a palm tree. They lay 2 to 5 eggs with rough, white shells, averaging about . In the pale-winged trumpeter and the grey-winged trumpeter, groups of adults care for a single clutch.

==Relationship with humans==
Trumpeters are often used as &quot;guard dogs&quot; because they call loudly when alarmed, become tame easily, and are believed to be adept at killing snakes. One source states their skill at hunting snakes as a fact, and the nineteenth-century botanist Richard Spruce gave an account of the friendliness and snake-killing prowess of a tame grey-winged trumpeter. For these reasons, Spruce recommended that England import trumpeters to India. However, another source says this prowess is &quot;reputed&quot;.

<doc id="262211" wikidata="Q374674" url="?curid=262211" title="Ignác Goldziher">
<text>Ignác (Yitzhaq Yehuda) Goldziher (22 June 1850 – 13 November 1921), often credited as Ignaz Goldziher, was a Hungarian scholar of Islam. Alongside Joseph Schacht and G.H.A. Juynboll, he is considered one of the pioneers of modern academic hadith studies. 

His most important work is the two-volume &quot;Muhammedanische Studien&quot; (&quot;Muslim Studies&quot;), especially its second volume, which addresses questions of the origins, evolution, and development of hadith. 

==Biography==

Born in Székesfehérvár of German Jewish heritage, he was educated at the universities of Budapest, Berlin, Leipzig and Leiden with the support of József Eötvös, Hungarian minister of culture. He became &quot;privatdozent&quot; at Budapest in 1872. In the next year, under the auspices of the Hungarian government, he began a journey through Syria, Palestine and Egypt, and took the opportunity of attending lectures of Muslim sheiks in the mosque of al-Azhar in Cairo. In 1888 he wrote his main studies of Islam which attributed several traditions of Muhammad to a later period. Goldziher was denied a teaching post at Budapest University until he was 44. He represented the Hungarian government and the Academy of Sciences at numerous international congresses. He received the large gold medal at the Stockholm Oriental Congress in 1889. He became a member of several Hungarian and other learned societies, and was appointed secretary of the Jewish community in Budapest. He was made Litt.D. of Cambridge (1904) and LL.D. of Aberdeen (1906). Goldziher died in Budapest.

== Religious views ==
Goldziher kept a personal record of his reflections, travel records and daily records. This journal was later published in his German mother tongue as &quot;Tagebuch&quot;. The following quotation from Goldziher&#x27;s published journal provides insight into his feelings about Islam.

: (p. 59)

:i.e., &quot;In those weeks, I truly entered into the spirit of Islam to such an extent that ultimately I became inwardly convinced that I myself was a Muslim, and judiciously discovered that this was the only religion which, even in its doctrinal and official formulation, can satisfy philosophic minds. My ideal was to elevate Judaism to a similar rational level. Islam, as my experience taught me, is the only religion in which superstitious and heathen ingredients are not frowned upon by rationalism, but by orthodox doctrine.&quot;

Sander Gilman, in commenting on this passage, writes that, &#x27;the Islam he discovered becomes the model for a new spirit of Judaism at the close of the nineteenth century.&#x27; In Cairo, Goldziher even prayed as a Muslim: &quot;In the midst of the thousands of the pious, I rubbed my forehead against the floor of the mosque. Never in my life was I more devout, more truly devout, than on that exalted Friday.&quot;

Despite his love for Islam, Goldziher remained a devout Jew all his life. This bond to the Mosaic faith was unusual for a man seeking an academic career in Europe in the late 19th century. He turned down several academic appointments outside of Hungary and struggled to understand his faith while transcending conventional piety and patriotism. This fact is significant in understanding his work. He saw Islam through the eyes of someone who refused to assimilate into contemporary European culture. In fact, despite his fondness for Islam, he had little affection, if not outright scorn, for European Christianity.

=== Judaism and Zionism ===

Goldziher viewed Zionism as an ethno-nationalist sentiment and a distinctly separate ideology from the religion of Judaism or what makes one a Jew, stating: 
&quot;Jewishness is a religious term and not an ethnographical one. As regards to my nationality I am a Transdanubian, and by religion a Jew. When I headed for Hungary from Jerusalem I felt I was coming home.&quot;

==Islamic studies==
In 1890, Ignaz Goldziher published his work &quot;Muhammedanische Studien&quot;, inaugurating what Fred Donner has called the &quot;traditional-critical approach&quot; to the studies of early Islam and Islamic texts. In this work, Goldziher became the first academic in the West to understand the corpus of hadith texts within the purview of the conflicting political, religious, and social interests that was faced by the Islamic community in the initial centuries of its existence. Goldziher argued, against prior views about the authenticity of the corpus, that these hadith were creations of later periods and that their origins often reflect the later types of interests by the community. The novelty of Goldziher&#x27;s analysis, compared to earlier Muslim efforts that attempted to delineate between historical and ahistorical hadith, was that Goldziher&#x27;s analysis were limited to hadith that had previously been considered authentic or historical in traditional Islamic narrative. Thus, Goldziher &quot;inaugurated the critical study&quot; of the hadith&#x27;s authenticity and concluded that &quot;the great majority of traditions from the Prophet are documents not of the time to which they claim to belong&quot; but created &quot;during the first centuries of Islam,&quot; i.e. were fraudulent. This included hadith &quot;accepted even in the most rigorously critical Muslim collections&quot;, which meant that &quot;the meticulous isnads which supported them were utterly fictitious&quot; (R. Stephen Humphreys). Instead, Goldziher argued in his book &quot;Muslim Studies&quot;, hadith were the product of &quot;debates and arguments within the emerging [Islamic] religion and society ... projected back into the time of the Prophet&quot; and were a means of putting &quot;support for one party or another ... into the mouth of the prophet&quot; (in the words of G.R. Hawting). Tied to this, and Goldziher&#x27;s observation of the massive scale on which hadith were forged, was his observation that each position in every political and doctrinal controversy could be paired with numerous supporting hadiths, each equipped with an isnad. Goldziher also observed replete anachronism in the hadith literature, including in:reports supporting the legitimacy of dynasties; traditions addressing how believers should respond to ungodly rulers; hadith supporting particular positions in theological controversies; reports giving voice to local patriotism; reports praising the merits of particular localities, tribes or families; apocalyptic prophecies of conquests and rebellions; and hadith praising the descendants of ʿAlī or, conversely, seeking to limit Alid legitimacy.As for isnads, Goldziher viewed them as a secondary attempt at justifying the traditions that particular actors cited during their controversies. The only relevant factor in evaluating the provenance and credibility of a hadith was its matn (content), and not its isnad.

He was a strong believer in the view that Islamic law owes its origins to Roman law but in the opinion of Patricia Crone his arguments here are &quot;uncharacteristically weak&quot;.

== Influence and reception ==

===Islamic studies===
Goldziher&#x27;s influence was a result of his careful investigation of pre-Islamic and Islamic law, tradition, religion and poetry, in connection with which he published a large number of treatises, review articles and essays contributed to the collections of the Hungarian Academy. Goldziher&#x27;s own analyses were limited to and sampled from legal and theological hadith, but his approach was extended into other categories of texts in the ensuing years, including Quran commentary, sira literature, and more, especially by Henri Lammens and Leone Caetani in the immediate years following his major work. Another effect of his work has been to shift the conversation away from the study of the type of history that can be reconstructed from these types of sources, which Goldziher thought was very little, and into what they tell us about how Muhammad was represented in the second and third centuries of the Islamic era in literary sources. Some have sought to counter or refute Goldziher, such as by arguing for a larger role in the written transmission of hadith from early periods (such as by the Turkish scholar Fuad Sezgin, and among others like Azami and Abbott), although this approach has not found much traction amongst other scholars. Broadly, Goldziher&#x27;s contention that hadith tell us little about the 7th century or the life of Muhammad has been widely accepted.

Along with Joseph Schacht (1902–1969), who expanded on his work, Goldziher is thought to have authored one of the &quot;two influential and founding works&quot; of Islamic studies or &quot;Orientalist&quot; studies (Goldziher&#x27;s being &quot;Muslim Studies&quot;) according to Mohammed Salem Al-Shehri.

=== Edward Said ===
Goldziher&#x27;s works have taken on a renewed importance in recent times owing to Edward Said&#x27;s book &quot;Orientalism&quot;. Said himself was to reprove his work&#x27;s defect for failing to pay sufficient attention to scholars like Goldziher. Of five major German orientalists, he remarked that four of them, despite their profound erudition, were hostile to Islam. Goldziher&#x27;s work was an exception in that he appreciated &#x27;Islam&#x27;s tolerance towards other religions&#x27;, though this was undermined by his dislike of anthropomorphism in Mohammad&#x27;s thought, and what Said calls &#x27;Islam&#x27;s too exterior theology and jurisprudence&#x27;.

<doc id="262213" wikidata="Q408993" url="?curid=262213" title="U.S. Route 30">
<text>U.S. Route 30 or U.S. Highway 30 (US 30) is an east–west main route of the United States Numbered Highway System, with the highway traveling across the Northern U.S. With a length of , it is the third-longest U.S. Highway, after US 20 and US 6. The western end of the highway is at US 101 in Astoria, Oregon; the eastern end is at Virginia Avenue, Absecon Boulevard, and Adriatic Avenue in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The &quot;0&quot; as the last digit in the number indicates that it is a coast-to-coast route and a major east–west route. Despite long stretches of parallel and concurrent Interstate Highways, it has not been decommissioned unlike other long-haul routes such as US 66. It is also the only U.S. Highway that has always been coast-to-coast since the beginning of U.S. Numbered Highway System.

US 20 and US 30 break the general U.S. Highway numbering rules in Oregon, since US 20 actually starts south of US 30 in Newport, running through the middle of Oregon, while US 30 runs parallel to the north of the state (the Columbia River and Interstate 84, or I-84). The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell, Idaho. This situation is because US 20 was not a planned coast-to-coast route while US 30 was.

Much of the historic Lincoln Highway, the first road across the U.S. (from New York City to San Francisco), became part of US 30; it is still known by that name in many areas.

===Oregon===
The western terminus of US 30 is at an intersection with US 101 at the southern end of the Astoria–Megler Bridge in downtown Astoria, Oregon, approximately from the Pacific Ocean. It heads east to Portland, where it uses a short section of freeway built for the canceled I-505. From there, it heads around the north side of downtown on I-405 and I-5 to reach I-84. Most of the rest of the route is concurrent with I‑84, with only about , under a fifth of its remaining length, off the freeway, mainly on old alignments.

===Idaho===

Upon entering Idaho, US 30 runs along its old surface route through Fruitland and New Plymouth before joining I‑84. It leaves at Bliss and soon crosses the Snake River, running south of it through Twin Falls and Burley before crossing it again and rejoining I‑84. At the split with I-86, US 30 continues east with I‑86 almost to its end at Pocatello. US 30 cuts southeast through downtown Pocatello to I-15, where it heads south to McCammon. There, it exits and heads east and southeast into Wyoming, not paralleling an Interstate Highway for the first time since Portland.

===Wyoming===

In Wyoming, US 30 heads southeast through Kemmerer to Granger, where it joins I-80 across the southern part of the state. It is also here that it joins the historic Lincoln Highway. As in the previous two states, US 30 remains with the Interstate highway for most of its path, only leaving for the old route in the following places:
* from Walcott to Laramie
* through Cheyenne
* through Pine Bluffs to the Nebraska state line

===Nebraska===

Unlike the three states to the west, Nebraska keeps US 30 completely separate from its parallel Interstates (I-80 in this case). From the state line to Grand Island, US 30 closely parallels I‑80. East of Grand Island, US 30 diverges from I‑80 and runs northeast toward Columbus on a highway parallel to the Platte River. At Columbus, it turns east toward Schuyler and Fremont and crosses the Missouri River into Iowa east of Blair.

===Iowa===

US 30 crosses Iowa from west to east approximately north of I-80. Between Missouri Valley and Denison, US 30 runs in a southwest–northeast direction. The majority of`US 30 east of Ames and west of the Mount Vernon–Cedar Rapids area () is a rural four-lane divided highway. A portion of the highway in Tama County is being upgraded to a divided highway. US 30 between Mount Vernon and Dewitt is a two–lane highway. It crosses the Mississippi River into Illinois on the Gateway Bridge at Clinton.

US 30S and US 30A are two previous alternate alignments of US 30 in Iowa. They followed the original alignment of US 30 in the state. They both began in Nebraska, entered Iowa in Council Bluffs, and extended north to Missouri Valley via Crescent to meet the current highway.

===Illinois===

US 30 heads east in Illinois to Rock Falls, where it begins to parallel I-88. At Aurora, it turns southeast to Joliet, where it is a major thoroughfare in the city of Joliet (Plainfield Road), and then back east through New Lenox, Frankfort, Mokena, Matteson, Olympia Fields, Park Forest, Chicago Heights, Ford Heights, and Lynwood to the Indiana state line, bypassing Chicago to the south. Notwithstanding, the original 1926 routing of US 30 ran directly through downtown Chicago.

===Indiana===

US 30 in Indiana is a major rural divided highway. It is not a freeway except at Fort Wayne, where it runs around the north side on I-69 and I-469. Between I-65 (at Merrillville) and I‑69 (at Fort Wayne), there are over 40 traffic signals on this divided highway, hindering smooth traffic flow. This is especially pronounced near Warsaw and Columbia City, where the speed limit is reduced as the highway runs through a commercial section with many businesses and traffic signals. Many of the other signals are concentrated between Hobart and Valparaiso, the two cities being about apart. It is, however, a four-lane divided road through its entirety within Indiana, generally avoiding small towns. Speed limits range but are generally .

===Ohio===

US 30 continues into Ohio, where it is mainly a four-lane divided highway until Canton. A proposal to make US 30 a limited-access freeway from Trump Avenue and State Route 11 (SR 11) was set in 2019 and federal funding set $18 million (equivalent to $ in ) to construct the new freeway. , the only sections that were limited access freeways are in Van Wert, Bucyrus, Mansfield, Wooster, and Canton. A section between I-71 and US 250 is a divided four-lane highway. A section between SR 57 and SR 172 is a four-lane divided highway, with traffic signals at two intersections. The highway passes through Van Wert. After Van Wert, it travels through Upper Sandusky where the highway runs concurrently with US 23. The section between Mansfield and Canton follows the old Lincoln Highway. The last remaining segments that will be upgraded to a freeway are past Canton; currently, the highway is a two-lane route that passes through East Canton, Minerva, and Lisbon. After Lisbon, it runs concurrently with SR 45 for and becomes a freeway. Designated with signs marking routes SR 11, SR 7, SR 39, and US 30. After joining SR 11, SR 7 becomes a part of the freeway where all three routes split in East Liverpool where US 30 joins SR 39 for and US 30 crosses the Ohio River into West Virginia.

===West Virginia===

US 30 runs for only about in West Virginia. It crosses the Ohio River over the Jennings Randolph Bridge, continuing the freeway from the Ohio section. After cutting through the town of Chester with only one interchange, West Virginia Route 2 (Carolina Avenue), the freeway section ends not too long after. US 30 continues across the northernmost piece of the Northern Panhandle on a two-lane road.

===Pennsylvania===
US 30 heads southeast into Pennsylvania, joining US 22 and then the Penn-Lincoln Parkway West west of Pittsburgh. It heads through downtown Pittsburgh on I-376/US 22, leaving at Wilkinsburg for its own alignment. From there, it roughly parallels the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) to the Philadelphia area, though, in many areas, particularly from York past Lancaster, and bypassing Coatesville, Downingtown, and Exton, it is far enough from the Pennsylvania Turnpike to require its own freeway. As it approaches Philadelphia, US 30 constitutes the main road of the Philadelphia Main Line, a string of affluent suburbs west of the city; often called Lancaster Avenue and Lancaster Pike through this stretch. US 30 then briefly joins I‑76 near Center City, Philadelphia, splitting onto I-676 as it crosses the Delaware River on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge.

===New Jersey===

US 30 splits from I-676 just east of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge toll plaza in Camden and heads southeast to Atlantic City, generally parallel to the Atlantic City Expressway, passing through the New Jersey Pine Barrens. For most of its New Jersey run, it is known as the White Horse Pike. It ends in Atlantic City at the intersection of Absecon Boulevard, Virginia Avenue, and Adriatic Avenue, about from the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
US 30 was originally proposed to run from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Atlantic City, New Jersey. West of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, this was designated largely along the Lincoln Highway, as part of a promise to the Lincoln Highway Association to assign a single number to their road as much as possible. West of Salt Lake City, US 40 continued to San Francisco, California, although it ran farther north than the Lincoln Highway east of Wadsworth, Nevada, and west of Sacramento, California.

The governments of Idaho and Oregon objected to Salt Lake City as the terminus for US 30 and requested extensions. What is now US 30 through those states (west of Burley, Idaho) had been designated as part of US 20, another transcontinental route, but traveled through Yellowstone National Park and was inaccessible during the winter season. The states agreed to take US 30 along that route, splitting from the route to Salt Lake City at Granger, Wyoming, and running along what had been designated as US 530. (That number was then reused for the spur toward Salt Lake City.) The planned US 530 had ended at US 91 at McCammon, Idaho, where the new US 30 turned north to Pocatello, meeting the planned US 20. (US 20 was truncated to Yellowstone National Park but later extended along its own route to the Pacific Ocean.) What had been designated as US 630, from US 30 at Echo to Ogden, Utah, was to be extended east on former US 30 to US 30 at Granger and northwest on US 91 and what had been designated US 191 to US 30 at Burley.

Utah objected to that plan, however, as it removed US 30 from that state, giving them only US 630, a branch. A compromise was reached, in which the US 630 route would become the main line of US 30, once improved to higher standards, but that was still not deemed completely satisfactory. Ultimately, in the final system, a split was approved between Burley, Idaho, and Granger, Wyoming, with US 30N running along the modern routing US 30, and US 30S taking the route through Utah (planned as US 630). In the final plan (dated November 11, 1926), the route toward Salt Lake City became US 530, ending at US 40 at Kimball Junction, Utah.

Around 1931, a split in Ohio was designated, from Delphos east to Mansfield. The original US 30 was assigned US 30S, and a straighter route became US 30N. US 30S was eliminated , putting US 30 on former US 30N.

US 30 was rerouted to bypass Omaha, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa, to the north. The former route, from Fremont, Nebraska, to Missouri Valley, Iowa, was designated US 30S. Around 1934, it was truncated to Omaha and it was changed from US 30S to US 30A and was removed from service in 1969 when the historic Douglas Street bridge was demolished. Later sections were relocated to parallel Interstate Highways in several states, including I-84 in Oregon and Idaho.

A signed US 30 Bypass was created in Portland, Oregon, beginning at the St. Johns Bridge, following (roughly) Lombard Street in North Portland, continuing along Sandy Boulevard, and rejoining the I-84/US 30 route in the center of the town of Wood Village. Portland also had a US 30 Business route along Northeast Sandy Boulevard; the route, however, was decommissioned in 2007.

In 1988, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) engineers proposed that US 30 be rerouted and upgraded to a four-lane controlled-access expressway through a portion of Lancaster County. The American Farmland Trust (AFT) opposed the plan because, according to Jim Riggle, then Director of Operations at AFT, it &quot;would have cut right through the heart of the best farmland [and] would probably have been the death knell of the Amish community&quot;. The plans were averted when more than a thousand Amish people, people who do not usually participate in the public process, &quot;drove their buggies to the meeting hall and expressed their concern by simply sitting quietly in the audience in their black homespun suits&quot;.

<text>The limpkin (Aramus guarauna), also called carrao, courlan, and crying bird, is a large wading bird related to rails and cranes, and the only extant species in the family Aramidae. It is found mostly in wetlands in warm parts of the Americas, from Florida to northern Argentina, but has been spotted as far north as Wisconsin and Southern Ontario. It feeds on molluscs, with the diet dominated by apple snails of the genus &quot;Pomacea&quot;. Its name derives from its seeming limp when it walks.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The limpkin is placed in the family Aramidae, which is in turn placed within the crane and rail order Gruiformes. The limpkin had been suggested to be close to the ibis and spoonbill family Threskiornithidae, based upon shared bird lice. The Sibley–Ahlquist taxonomy of birds, based upon DNA–DNA hybridization, suggested that the limpkin&#x27;s closest relatives were the Heliornithidae finfoots, and Sibley and Monroe even placed the species in that family in 1990. More recent studies have found little support for this relationship. More recent DNA studies have confirmed a close relationship with particularly the cranes, with the limpkin remaining as a family close to the cranes and the two being sister taxa to the trumpeters.

Although the limpkin is the only extant species in the family today, several fossils of extinct Aramidae are known from across the Americas. The earliest known species, &quot;Aramus paludigrus&quot;, is dated to the middle Miocene, while the oldest supposed members of the family, &quot;Aminornis&quot; and &quot;Loncornis&quot;, have been found in early Oligocene deposits in Argentina, although whether these are indeed related is not certain; in fact, &quot;Loncornis&quot; seems to be a misidentified mammal bone. Another Oligocene fossil from Europe, &quot;Parvigrus pohli&quot; (family Parvigruidae), has been described as a mosaic of the features shared by the limpkins and the cranes. It shares many morphological features with the cranes and limpkins, but also was much smaller than either group, and was more rail-like in its proportions. In the paper describing the fossil, Gerald Mayr suggested that it was similar to the stem species of the grues (the cranes and limpkins), and that the limpkins evolved massively long bills as a result of the specialisation to feeding on snails. In contrast, the cranes evolved into long-legged forms to walk and probe on open grasslands.

===Subspecies===
Between 1856 and 1934, the limpkin was treated as two species, one in South America (&quot;Aramus guarauna&quot;) and the other found in Central America, the Caribbean, and Florida (&quot;Aramus pictus&quot;). Today, it is treated as a single species with four subspecies. Along with the nominate subspecies &quot;A. g. guarauna&quot;, &quot;A. g. dolosus&quot;, &quot;A. g. elucus&quot; (both J. L. Peters, 1925), and &quot;A. g. pictus&quot; (F. A. A. Meyer, 1794) are recognized. The difference between the subspecies are related to slight differences in size and plumage.
* &quot;Aramus guarauna guarauna&quot; - South America (except the arid west coast, the Andes and extreme south)
* &quot;Aramus guarauna pictus&quot; - Florida, Georgia, The Bahamas, Cuba and Jamaica
* &quot;Aramus guarauna elucus&quot; - Hispaniola and (formerly) Puerto Rico
* &quot;Aramus guarauna dolosus&quot; - Southwestern Mexico to Panama

==Description==
The limpkin is a somewhat large bird, long, with a wingspan of . Body mass ranges from , averaging . The males are slightly larger than the females in size, but no difference in plumage is seen. Its plumage is drab—dark brown with an olive luster above. The feathers of the head, neck, wing coverts, and much of the back and underparts (except the rear) are marked with white, making the body look streaked and the head and neck light gray. It has long, dark-gray legs and a long neck. Its bill is long, heavy, and downcurved, yellowish bill with a darker tip. The bill is slightly open near but not at the end to give it a tweezers-like action in removing snails from their shells, and in many individuals the tip curves slightly to the right, like the apple snails&#x27; shells. The white markings are slightly less conspicuous in first-year birds. Its wings are broad and rounded and its tail is short. It is often confused with the immature American white ibis.

This bird is easier to hear than see. Its common vocalization is a loud wild wail or scream with some rattling quality, represented as &quot;&quot;kwEEEeeer&quot; or &quot;klAAAar&quot;.&quot; This call is most often given at night and at dawn and dusk. Other calls include &quot;wooden clicking&quot;, clucks, and in alarm, a &quot;piercing &quot;bihk, bihk...&quot;&quot;.
==Distribution and habitat==
The limpkin occurs from peninsular Florida (and the Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia) and southern Mexico through the Caribbean and Central America to northern Argentina. In South America, it occurs widely east of the Andes; west of them its range extends only to the Equator.

It inhabits freshwater marshes and swamps, often with tall reeds, as well as mangroves. In the Caribbean, it also inhabits dry brushland. In Mexico and northern Central America, it occurs at altitudes up to . In Florida, the distribution of apple snails is the best predictor of where limpkins can be found.

The limpkin undertakes some localized migrations, although the extent of these is not fully understood. In some parts in the northern part of the range, females (and a few males) leave the breeding areas at the end of summer, returning at the end of winter. In Brazil, birds breeding in some seasonal marshes leave during the dry season and return again with the rains. Birds may also migrate between Florida and Cuba, as several limpkins on the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas have been reported, but these records may also represent vagrants or postbreeding dispersal. One study in Florida using wing tags found limpkins dispersed up to away from the breeding site. This tendency may explain vagrant limpkins seen in other parts of the United States and at sea near the Bahamas.

==Behavior and ecology==
Limpkins are active during the day, but also forage at night. Where they are not persecuted, they are also very tame and approachable. Even so, they are usually found near cover. They are not aggressive for the most part, being unconcerned by other species and rarely fighting with members of their own species.

Because of their long toes, they can stand on floating water plants. They also swim well, both as adults or as newly hatched chicks, but they seldom do so. They fly strongly, the neck projecting forward and the legs backward, the wings beating shallowly and stiffly, with a jerky upstroke, above the horizontal most of the time.

===Feeding===
Limpkins forage primarily in shallow water and on floating vegetation such as water hyacinth and water lettuce. When wading, they seldom go deeper than having half the body underwater, and never are submerged up to the back. They walk slowly with a gait described as &quot;slightly undulating&quot; and &quot;giving the impression of lameness or limping&quot;, &quot;high-stepping&quot;, or &quot;strolling&quot;, looking for food if the water is clear or probing with the bill. They do not associate with other birds in mixed-species feeding flocks, as do some other wading birds, but may forage in small groups with others of their species.

The diet of the limpkin is dominated by apple snails (Ampullariidae) of the genus &quot;Pomacea&quot;. The availability of this one mollusk has a significant effect on the local distribution of the limpkin. Freshwater mussels, including &quot;Anodonta cowperiana&quot;, &quot;Villosa vibex&quot;, &quot;Elliptio strigosus&quot;, &quot;E. jayensis&quot;, and &quot;Uniomerus obesus&quot;, as well as other kinds of snails, are a secondary food sources. Less important prey items are insects, frogs, lizards, crustaceans (such as crayfish) and worms, as well as seeds. These prey items may be important in periods of drought or flooding when birds may be pushed into less than optimal foraging areas. In one site in Florida, moon snails and mussels were the most important prey items. Two studies, both in Florida, have looked at the percentage composition of the diet of limpkins. One, looking at stomach contents, found 70% &quot;Pomacea&quot; apple snails, 3% &quot;Campeloma&quot;, and 27% unidentified mollusc, probably &quot;Pomacea&quot;.

When a limpkin finds an apple snail, it carries it to land or very shallow water and places it in mud, the opening facing up. It deftly removes the operculum or &quot;lid&quot; and extracts the snail, seldom breaking the shell. The extraction takes 10 to 20 seconds. The orange-yellow yolk gland of female snails is usually shaken loose and not eaten. It often leaves piles of empty shells at favored spots.

===Reproduction and breeding===

Males have exclusive territories, which can vary in size from . In large, uniform swamps, nesting territories can often be clumped together, in the form of large colonies. These are vigorously defended, with males flying to the territory edges to challenge intruders and passing limpkins being chased out of the territory. Territorial displays between males at boundaries include ritualized charging and wing-flapping. Females may also participate in territorial defense, but usually only against other females or juveniles. Territories may be maintained year-round or abandoned temporarily during the nonbreeding season, usually due to lack of food.

Limpkins may be either monogamous, with females joining a male&#x27;s territory, or serially polyandrous, with two or more females joining a male. With the monogamous pairs, banding studies have shown that a small number of pairs reform the following year (four out of 18 pairs).

Nests may be built in a wide variety of places – on the ground, in dense floating vegetation, in bushes, or at any height in trees. They are bulky structures of rushes, sticks, or other materials. Nest building is undertaken by the male initially, which constructs the nest in his territory prior to pair-bond formation. Unpaired females visit a number of territories before settling on a male with which to breed. Males may initially challenge and fight off prospective mates, and may not accept first-year females as mates. Pair-bond formation may take a few weeks. Courtship feeding is part of the bonding process, where males catch and process a snail and then feed it to the female.

The clutch consists of three to eight eggs, with five to seven being typical and averaging 5.5, which measure . The egg color is highly variable. Their background color ranges from gray-white through buff to deep olive, and they are marked with light-brown and sometimes purplish-gray blotches and speckles. The eggs are laid daily until the clutch is complete, and incubation is usually delayed until the clutch is completed. Both parents incubate the eggs during the day, but only the female incubates at night. The shift length is variable, but the male incubates for longer during the day. The male remains territorial during incubation, and leaves the clutch to chase off intruders; if this happens, the female returns quickly to the eggs. The incubation period is about 27 days, and all the eggs hatch within 24 hours of each other.

The young hatch covered with down, capable of walking, running, and swimming. They follow their parents to a platform of aquatic vegetation, where they are brooded. They are fed by both parents; they reach adult size at 7 weeks and leave their parents at about 16 weeks.

===Ecology===
Limpkins are reported to be attacked and eaten by American alligators. Also, adults with serious foot and leg injuries have been reported, suggesting they may have been attacked by turtles while standing on floating vegetation. Their nests are apparently preyed upon by snakes, raccoons, crows, and muskrats. Foraging adults may in times of drought be victims of kleptoparasitism by snail kites, and the attempted theft of apple snails caught by limpkins has also been observed in boat-tailed grackles.

Limpkins in Florida were examined for parasites, which included trematodes, nematodes, and biting lice. Two biting lice species were found, &quot;Laemobothrion cubense&quot; and &quot;Rallicola funebris&quot;. The trematode &quot;Prionosoma serratum&quot; was found in the intestines of some birds; this species may enter the bird after first infecting apple snails (this has been shown to be the route of infection for a closely related trematode to infect snail kites). Nematodes &quot;Amidostomum acutum&quot; and &quot;Strongyloides&quot; spp. are also ingested and live in the gut.

==Relationship with humans==
Many of the limpkin&#x27;s names across its range are onomatopoeic and reflect the bird&#x27;s call; for example, &quot;carau &quot;in Argentina, &quot;carrao&quot; in Venezuela, and &quot;guareáo &quot;in Cuba. The species also has a range of common names that refer to its call, for example lamenting bird, or to its supposed gait, crippled bird. The limpkin does not feature much in folklore, although in the Amazon people believe that when the limpkin starts to call, the river will not rise any more. Its call has been used for jungle sound effects in Tarzan films and for the hippogriff in the film &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;.

<text>William J. C. Amend III (; born September 20, 1962) is an American cartoonist. He is known for his comic strip &quot;FoxTrot&quot;. 

==Early life==
Amend was born in Massachusetts and raised in Northern California. He attended high school in Burlingame, California where he was a cartoonist on his school newspaper. Amend is an Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. He graduated with a degree in physics from Amherst College in 1984.

==Career==
After about a month in the animation business, Amend got fired for being unqualified and decided to pursue a cartooning career and got signed on with Universal Press Syndicate after three years of trying. &quot;FoxTrot&quot; first appeared on April 10, 1988. On May 21, 1999, Amherst College awarded him an honorary degree as Doctor of Humane Letters.

On December 5, 2006, Universal Press Syndicate issued a press release stating that his strip, &quot;FoxTrot&quot;, would turn into a Sunday-only strip. Amend stated that he wanted to continue doing the strip, but at a less hurried pace. This news was followed by several weeks of the characters discussing a &quot;cartoonist&quot; semi-retiring to Sundays only, and what methods he would use to phase out the daily strips. The last daily &quot;FoxTrot&quot; cartoon was printed on December 30, 2006. Amend also sometimes did guest strips for webcomics such as Scott Kurtz&#x27;s &quot;PvP&quot;, Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins&#x27;s &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, and Randall Munroe&#x27;s &quot;XKCD&quot;.

On May 26, 2007, Amend was presented with the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year.

==Personal life==
Amend made a television appearance on &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;, which aired October 20, 2003, on the former TechTV. Amend was also an avid &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; player who played on the server &quot;Bronzebeard&quot;.

<doc id="262220" wikidata="Q685250" url="?curid=262220" title="Octave Crémazie">
<text>Octave Crémazie (; April 16, 1827 – January 16, 1879) was a French Canadian poet and bookseller born in Quebec City. Recognized both during and after his lifetime for his patriotic verse and his significant role in the cultural development of Quebec, Crémazie has been called &quot;the father of French Canadian poetry.&quot;

Octave was the youngest of the four surviving children of Jacques Crémazie and Marie-Anne Miville. From 1836 to 1844, he was a student at the Seminary of Quebec, where the priest John Holmes (American priest) introduced him to the works of the French Romantic writers. Alfred de Musset, Alphonse de Lamartine, and Victor Hugo, in particular, had a profound influence on the future poet.

After finishing his studies at the Seminary of Quebec, Crémazie went into business with his brother Joseph, a bookseller. Their shop in Quebec City, the &quot;J. et O. Crémazie&quot; bookstore, established in 1833, was instrumental in the North American dissemination of works by many Romantic writers. It was also a meeting place for the members of what would become known as Quebec&#x27;s literary movement of 1860.

While still in his early twenties, Crémazie helped found the Institut canadien, an organization devoted to the promotion of French Canadian culture. He would later serve as the organization&#x27;s president (from 1857 to 1858).

Crémazie&#x27;s first published poems appeared in &quot;L&#x27;Ami de la religion et de la patrie&quot; (edited by his brother Jacques) and other Quebec City newspapers. Recognition for his poetry grew throughout the 1850s. As French-Canadian literature scholar Odette Condemine writes:

His nostalgic evocation of the happiness that preceded the Conquest and the miseries that followed roused his compatriots&#x27; fervour. &quot;Le vieux soldat canadien&quot; (1855) and &quot;Le Drapeau de Carillon&quot; (1858) were enthusiastically received and won Crémazie his title as &quot;national bard.&quot; 

The longing for a glorious, vanished past and the sense of estrangement from France in Crémazie&#x27;s work has prompted the critic Gilles Marcotte to describe it as a poetry of exile.

Despite the popularity of his bookstore, Octave Crémazie&#x27;s extravagant taste for foreign commodities led to large debts and trouble with creditors. By 1862, his financial situation had become so dire that he fled to France in secret, leaving the bookstore bankrupt. He lived at different times in Paris, Bordeaux, and Le Havre under the name of Jules Fontaine, poor and isolated despite having secured a modest job and the support of a few French friends.

Crémazie&#x27;s poetic production stopped when he left Quebec. The documents that survive from his later years include his &quot;Journal du siège de Paris&quot;, a diary detailing the hardship that Parisians and Crémazie himself endured during the siege of the capital in 1870 and 1871. Many of his letters to close friends and family members also survive, including his correspondence with the priest Raymond Casgrain, to whom Crémazie often expressed his ideas about literature.

Octave Crémazie died in Le Havre on January 16, 1879.

&quot;Œuvres complètes&quot;, a volume of Crémazie&#x27;s poems and letters edited by Raymond Casgrain, was published in 1882 by the Beauchemin bookstore in Montreal and the Institut canadien de Québec. The book included the following remarks: &quot;In a word, the publishers wanted this book to stand as the most enduring monument that could be raised to the memory of the most patriotic, and indeed the most hapless, of our poets.&quot;

A statue depicting a French Canadian soldier stands in Montreal&#x27;s Saint-Louis Square (Rue de Malines and Saint-Denis) with Crémazie&#x27;s name across the top and the years 1827–1879 (his years of birth and death). Underneath the soldier are the words: &quot;Pour mon drapeau je viens ici mourir&quot; (literally: &quot;For my flag I come here to die&quot;). There is also a Montreal metro station named for him on the orange line, located on the boulevard likewise named in his honour.

<text>In Hawaiian religion, Pele (pronounced ) is the goddess of volcanoes and fire and the creator of the Hawaiian Islands. Often referred to as &quot;Madame Pele&quot; or &quot;Tūtū Pele&quot; as a sign of respect, she is a well-known deity within Hawaiian mythology and is notable for her contemporary presence and cultural influence as an enduring figure from ancient Hawaii. Epithets of the goddess include &quot;Pele-honua-mea&quot; (&#x27;Pele of the sacred land&#x27;) and &quot;Ka wahine ʻai honua&quot; (&#x27;The earth-eating woman&#x27;).

In different stories talking about the goddess Pele, she was born from the female spirit named Haumea, a descendant of Papa, or Earth Mother, and Wakea, Sky Father, both descendants of the supreme beings. Pele is also known as &quot;She who shapes the sacred land,&quot; known to be said in ancient Hawaiian chants. The first published stories about Pele were written down by William Ellis.

==Legends==

Kīlauea is a currently active volcano that is located on the island of Hawaii and is still being extensively studied. Many Hawaiians believe Kilauea to be inhabited by a &quot;family of fire gods,&quot; one of the sisters being Pele who is believed to govern Kilauea and is responsible for controlling its lava flows.
There are several traditional legends associated with Pele in Hawaiian mythology. In addition to being recognized as the goddess of volcanoes, Pele is also known for her power, passion, jealousy, and capriciousness. She has numerous siblings, including Kāne Milohai, Kamohoalii, Nāmaka, and numerous sisters named Hiiaka, the most famous being Hiiakaikapoliopele (Hiiaka in the bosom of Pele). They are usually considered to be the offspring of Haumea. Pele&#x27;s siblings include deities of various types of wind, rain, fire, ocean wave forms, and cloud forms. Her home is believed to be the fire pit called Halemaʻumaʻu at the summit caldera of Kīlauea, one of the Earth&#x27;s most active volcanoes, but her domain encompasses all volcanic activity on the Big Island of Hawaii.

Pele shares features similar to other malignant deities inhabiting volcanoes, as in the case of the devil Guayota of Guanche Mythology in the Canary Islands, living on the volcano Teide and considered by the aboriginal Guanches as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano.

Legend told that Pele herself journeyed on her canoe from the island of Tahiti to Hawaiʻi. When on her journey, it was said she tried to create her fires on different islands, but her sister, Nāmaka, was chasing her, wanting to put an end to her. In the end, the two sisters fought each other and Pele was killed. With this happening, her body was destroyed but her spirit lives in Halemaʻumaʻu on Kilauea. They say, &quot;Her body is the lava and steam that comes from the volcano. She can also change form, appearing as a white dog, old woman, or beautiful young woman.&quot;

In addition to her role as goddess of fire and her strong association with volcanoes, Pele is also regarded as the &quot;goddess of the hula.&quot; She is a significant figure in the history of hula because of her sister Hiiaka, who is believed to be the first person to dance hula. As a result of Pele&#x27;s significance in hula, there have been many hula dances and chants dedicated to her and her family. With hula being dedicated to Pele, the dance is often performed in a way that represents her intense personality and the movement of volcanoes.

===Expulsion version===
In one version of the story, Pele is the daughter of Kanehoalani and Haumea in the mystical land of Kuaihelani, a floating free land like Fata Morgana. Kuaihelani was in the region of Kahiki (&quot;Kukulu o Kahiki&quot;). She stays close to her mother&#x27;s fireplace with the fire-keeper Lono-makua. Her older sister Nā-maka-o-Kahai, a sea goddess, fears that Pele&#x27;s ambition would smother the homeland and drives Pele away. Kamohoali&#x27;i takes Pele south in a canoe called Honua-i-a-kea, along with her younger sister Hiiaka and with her brothers Kamohoalii, Kane-milo-hai, Kane-apua, arriving at the islets above Hawaii. There Kane-milo-hai is left on Mokupapapa, just a reef, to build it up in fitness for human residence. On Nihoa, 800 feet above the ocean, Pele leaves Kane-apua after her visit to Lehua and after crowning a wreath of kau-no&#x27;a. Pele feels sorry for her younger brother and picks him up again. Pele used the divining rod, Pa‘oa, to pick a new home. A group of chants tells of a pursuit by Namakaokahaʻi, who tears Pele apart. Her bones, KaiwioPele, form a hill on Kahikinui, while her spirit escaped to the island of Hawaii.

===Flood version===
In another version, Pele comes from a land said to be &quot;close to the clouds,&quot; with parents Kane-hoa-lani and Ka-hina-lii, and brothers Ka-moho-alii and Kahuila-o-ka-lani. From her husband Wahieloa (also called Wahialoa) she has a daughter, Laka, and a son Menehune. Pele-kumu-honua entices her husband and Pele travels in search of him. The sea pours from her head over the land of Kanaloa (perhaps the island now known as Kahoolawe) and her brothers say:
&lt;poem&gt;
O the sea, the great sea!
Forth bursts the sea:
Behold, it bursts on Kanaloa!&lt;/poem&gt;
The sea floods the land, then recedes; this flooding is called Kai a Kahinalii (&quot;The sea of Ka-hina-lii&quot;), as Pele&#x27;s connection to the sea was passed down from her mother Kahinalii.

===Pele and Poliʻahu===
Pele is considered to be a rival of the Hawaiian goddess of snow, Poliʻahu, and her sisters Lilinoe (a goddess of fine rain), Waiau (goddess of Lake Waiau), and Kahoupokane (a kapa-maker whose kapa-making activities create thunder, rain, and lightning). All except Kahoupokane reside on Mauna Kea. The kapa-maker lives on Hualalai.

One myth tells that Poliʻahu had come from Mauna Kea with her friends to attend sled races down the grassy hills south of Hamakua. Pele came disguised as a beautiful stranger and was greeted by Poliʻahu. However, Pele became jealously enraged at the goddess of Mauna Kea. She opened the caverns of Mauna Kea and threw fire from them towards Poliʻahu, with the snow goddess fleeing towards the summit. Poliʻahu was finally able to grab her now-burning snow mantle and throw it over the mountain. Earthquakes shook the island as the snow mantle unfolded until it reached the fire fountains, chilling and hardening the lava. The rivers of lava were driven back to Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Later battles also led to the defeat of Pele and confirmed the supremacy of the snow goddesses in the northern portion of the island, and Pele in the southern portion.

=== Pele, Hiʻiaka, and Lohiʻau ===
In one account of the Pele myths, she is banished from her home in Tahiti for creating hot spots by her older sister, Namakaokahaʻi, who also convinced the rest of her family that Pele would burn them all. Then, Pele travels on the canoe Honuaiakea to find a new home with her brother Kamohoaliʻi. Her mother gave her an egg to take care of and it later hatches into a baby girl whom Pele names Hiʻiaka-i-ka-poli-o-pele (Hiʻiaka in the Bosom of Pele) or Hiʻiaka for short. She is her favorite sister and encouraged her to befriend the people of Puna. However, when Hiʻiaka became best friends with a girl named Hōpoe, Pele became jealous of their friendship. Pele saw Lohiʻau, a chief of Kauaʻi, in a dream, sending Hiʻiaka to bring him to her in forty days or else she would punish them. When Hiʻiaka seeks out Lohiʻau, she discovers he is dead but she calls upon the power of the sorcery goddess Uli to revive him. As Hiʻiaka is on her journey, Pele grows impatient and sends a lava flow to Hōpoe&#x27;s home before the forty days were up. When Hiʻiaka returns to Hawaiʻi with Lohiʻau, she saw Hōpoe covered in stone and knew Pele was behind this. Hiʻiaka spitefully embraced Lohiʻau in Pele&#x27;s view, which further angered Pele, who then covered Lohiʻau with lava as well. The sisters saw that their anger led to the death of the two people who meant the most to them, so Pele apologetically brought Lohiʻau back to life and let him decide whom he would choose. Unfortunately for Pele, Lohiʻau ended up choosing Hiʻiaka, yet Pele gave them both her blessing.

In another version of the myth, Pele hears the beating of drums and chanting coming from Kauaʻi while she is sleeping and travels there in her spirit form. She disguises herself as a beautiful young woman and meets Lohiʻau in this way. After three days of making love together, Pele goes back to Hawaiʻi and Lohiʻau dies from a broken heart.

==Modern times==
Belief in Pele continued after the old religion was officially abolished in 1819. In the summer of 1823 English missionary William Ellis toured the island to determine locations for mission stations. After a long journey to the volcano Kīlauea with little food, Ellis eagerly ate the wild berries he found growing there. The berries of the ōhelo &quot;(Vaccinium reticulatum)&quot; plant are considered sacred to Pele. Traditionally prayers and offerings to Pele were always made before eating the berries. The volcano crater was an active lava lake, which the natives feared was a sign that Pele was not pleased with the violation.
Although wood carvings and thatched temples were easily destroyed, the volcano was a natural monument to the goddess.
In December 1824 the High Chiefess Kapiolani descended into Halemaʻumaʻu after reciting a Christian prayer instead of the traditional Hawaiian one to Pele. As it was predicted, she survived and this story was often told by missionaries to show the superiority of their faith. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) wrote a poem about the incident in 1892.

An urban legend states that Pele herself occasionally warns locals of impending eruptions. Appearing in the form of either a beautiful young woman or an elderly woman with white hair, sometimes accompanied by a small white dog, and always dressed in a red muumuu, Pele is said to walk along the roads near Kīlauea, but will vanish if passersby stop to help her, similar to the Resurrection Mary or vanishing hitchhiker legend. The passerby is then obliged to warn others or suffer misfortune in the next eruption. Another legend, Pele&#x27;s Curse, states that Pele&#x27;s wrath will fall on anyone who removes items from her island. Every year numerous small natural items are returned by post to the National Park Service by tourists seeking Pele&#x27;s forgiveness. It is believed Pele&#x27;s Curse was invented in the mid-20th century to deter tourist depredation.

When businessman George Lycurgus ran a hotel at the rim of Kīlauea, called the Volcano House from 1904 through 1921, he would often &quot;pray&quot; to Pele for the sake of the tourists. Park officials frowned upon his practices of tossing items, such as gin bottles (after drinking their contents), into the crater.

William Hyde Rice included an 11-page summary of the legends of Pele in his 1923 collection of Hawaiian legends, a reprint of which is available online from the Bernice P. Bishop Museum&#x27;s Special Publications section.

In 2003 the Volcano Art Center had a special competition for Pele paintings to replace one done in the early 20th century by D. Howard Hitchcock displayed in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park visitors center. The existing portrait of what looked like a blond Caucasian as the Hawaiian goddess had been criticized by many Native Hawaiians. Over 140 paintings were submitted, and finalists were displayed at sites within the park. The winner of the contest was artist Arthur Johnsen of Puna. This version shows the goddess in shades of red, with her digging staff &quot;Pāʻoa&quot; in her left hand, and an embryonic form of her sister goddess Hiʻiaka in her right hand. The painting is now on display at the Kilauea Visitor Center.

The religious group Love Has Won briefly moved to Hawaii and sparked violent protests from locals after claiming their founder Amy Carlson was Pele. 

Pele is among the gods and goddesses depicted in Walt Disney&#x27;s Enchanted Tiki Room at the Disney Parks. She is voiced by Ginny Tyler.

== Chants ==

Both of the chants above were performed at Halemaʻumaʻu, where it is said Pele currently resides.

== Other data ==
Pele shares features similar to other malignant deities inhabiting volcanoes, as in the case of the devil Guayota of Guanche Mythology in Canary Islands (Spain), living on the volcano Teide and was considered by the aboriginal Guanches as responsible for the eruptions of the volcano.

==In geology ==
Several phenomena connected to volcanism have been named after her, including Pele&#x27;s hair, Pele&#x27;s tears, and Limu o Pele (Pele&#x27;s seaweed). A volcano on the Jovian moon Io is also named Pele.

Myths about Pele encode dateable natural events. The chronology of Pele’s journey corresponds with the geological age of the Hawaiian islands.

In 2006, one volcanologist suggested the battle between Pele and Hiʻiaka was inspired by geological events around 1500 AD.

<text>Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex (16 September 1541 – 22 September 1576), was an English nobleman and general. From 1573 until his death he fought in Ireland in connection with the Plantations of Ireland, most notably the Rathlin Island massacre. He was the father of Robert, 2nd Earl of Essex, who was Elizabeth I&#x27;s favourite during her later years.

==Family==
Walter Devereux was the eldest son of Sir Richard Devereux, who was created a knight of the Bath on 20 February 1547 and died that same year, in the lifetime of his father, the 1st Viscount Hereford. Walter Devereux&#x27;s mother was Lady Dorothy Hastings, daughter of the 1st Earl of Huntingdon and Anne Stafford, said to have been a mistress of King Henry VIII. Through his paternal ancestry he was related to the Bourchier family, to which previous earls of Essex had belonged: John Devereux, son of Walter Devereux who died at the Battle of Bosworth, married Cecily Bourchier, sister of Henry Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Essex.

==Career==
On his grandfather&#x27;s death, Devereux became on 27 September 1558 The 2nd Viscount Hereford and 11th Baron Ferrers of Chartley. He was entrusted with joint custody of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1568, and appointed Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire in 1569 (which he held through the end of his life). Lord Hereford, as he was now, provided signal service in suppressing the Northern Rebellion of 1569, serving as high marshal of the field under The 3rd Earl of Warwick and Lord Clinton. For his zeal in the service of Queen Elizabeth I on this and other occasions, he was made a Knight of the Garter on 17 June 1572 and was created Earl of Essex and Ewe, and Viscount Bourchier, on 4 May 1572.

Eager to give proof of &quot;his good devotion to employ himself in the service of her Majesty,&quot; Lord Essex, as he was now, offered on certain conditions to subdue or colonise, at his own expense, a portion of the Irish province of Ulster. At that time, Ulster, in the north of Ireland, was completely under the dominion of the O&#x27;Neills, led by Sir Brian MacPhelim and Sir Turlough Luineach, and of the Scots led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell. His offer, with certain modifications, was accepted. He set sail for Ireland from Liverpool in August 1573, accompanied by a number of earls, knights and gentlemen, and with a force of about 1,200 men.

His enterprise had an inauspicious beginning; a storm dispersed his fleet and drove some of his vessels as far as Cork and the Isle of Man. His forces did not all reach the place of rendezvous till late in the autumn, and he was compelled to entrench himself at Belfast for the winter. Here his troops were diminished by sickness, famine and desertion to not much more than 200 men.

Intrigues of various sorts and fighting of a guerilla type followed, and Essex had difficulties both with his deputy Fitzwilliam and with the Queen. He was in dire straits, and his offensive movements in the east of Ulster took the form of raids and brutal massacres among the O&#x27;Neills. In October 1574, he treacherously captured MacPhelim at a conference and feast in Belfast Castle, and after slaughtering his attendants there, had MacPhelim, his wife and brother executed at Dublin. He arrested William Piers, who had been active in driving the Scots out of Ulster, and accused him of passing military intelligence to Sir Brian mac Phelim O&#x27;Neill. Essex ordered Piers&#x27;s arrest and detention in Carrickfergus Castle in December 1574, but Piers was freed and he successfully executed Sir Brian mac Phelim O&#x27;Neill for treason.

After encouraging Lord Essex to prepare to attack the Irish chief Sir Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, apparently at the instigation of The 1st Earl of Leicester, the Queen suddenly commanded him to &quot;break off his enterprise.&quot; However, she left him a certain discretionary power, and he took advantage of that to defeat Sir Turlough Luineach and chastise County Antrim. He also massacred several hundreds of Sorley Boy&#x27;s following, chiefly women and children, who had hidden in the caves of Rathlin Island in the face of an amphibious assault led by Francis Drake and Sir John Norreys.

He returned to England at the end of 1575, resolved &quot;to live henceforth an untroubled life.&quot; He was, however, persuaded to accept the offer of the Queen to make him Earl Marshal of Ireland. He arrived in Dublin in September 1576, but fell ill at the banquet given in his honour at Dublin Castle, and died three weeks later, probably of dysentery. It was suspected that he had been poisoned at the behest of Lord Leicester, who married his widow two years later. A post-mortem was carried out and concluded that Essex had died of natural causes (Alice Draycott, daughter of the prominent judge Henry Draycott, who drank from the same cup as Essex at the banquet, also died soon afterwards). He was succeeded in the Earldom of Essex by his son Robert.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1561 or 1562, Lord Hereford, as he was at the time, married Lettice Knollys, daughter of Sir Francis Knollys and Catherine Carey. Lord and Lady Hereford, later Earl and Countess of Essex, had the following children:
*Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Married Frances Walsingham
*Sir Walter Devereux. Married Margaret, daughter of Arthur Dakyns. He was killed at the siege of Rouen in 1591.
*Penelope Devereux. Married The 3rd Baron Rich
*Dorothy Devereux. Married The 9th Earl of Northumberland
*Francis Devereux (died in infancy)

<text>Jean Drapeau (; 18 February 1916 – 12 August 1999) was a Canadian politician who served as mayor of Montreal for 2 non-consecutive terms from 1954 to 1957 and from 1960 to 1986. 
Major accomplishments of the Drapeau Administration include the development of the Montreal Metro entirely underground mass transit subway system running on &#x27;whisper quiet&#x27; rubber wheels, a successful international exposition Expo 67 as well as the construction of a major performing arts centre, the Place des Arts. Drapeau also secured the hosting of the 1976 Summer Olympics and was instrumental in building the Olympic Stadium and then world&#x27;s tallest inclined tower. Drapeau was responsible for securing a Major League Baseball franchise, with the creation of the Montreal Expos in 1969. Drapeau&#x27;s main legacy is Montreal&#x27;s attainment of global status under his administration. He was the longest serving mayor of Montreal.

== Early life and career ==

The son of Joseph-Napoléon Drapeau and Alberta (Berthe) Martineau, Jean Drapeau was born in Montreal in 1916. His father, an insurance broker, city councillor and election worker for the , introduced him to politics. Jean Drapeau studied law at the .

Drapeau was a protégé of nationalist priest Lionel Groulx in the 1930s and 1940s, and was a member of André Laurendeau&#x27;s anti-conscription &#x27;. In 1942, he ran as a candidate of the nationalist , which opposed Canadian conscription during World War II, in a federal by-election. Drapeau lost the election. He was also a &#x27; candidate in the 1944 provincial election but was badly defeated in his Montreal constituency.

He began his practice as a criminal lawyer in Montreal in 1944. During the Asbestos strike of 1949, he took on the legal defence of some of the strikers.

In 1945, he married Marie-Claire Boucher. They had three sons.

== Mayor of Montreal ==

Drapeau&#x27;s profile grew as the result of his role in a public inquiry led by Pacifique Plante into police corruption in the early 1950s. When Camillien Houde retired as mayor of Montreal, Drapeau was well poised to succeed him.

Drapeau was elected mayor of Montreal in 1954 at the age of 37, as the candidate of the Civic Action League, on a platform of cleaning up the administration. He ran an exceptionally wide-flung campaign, uniting a large coalition of voters from English-speaking and French-speaking parts of Montreal. Drapeau&#x27;s charismatic demeanor, accessible style, and his fluency in both English and French (unprecedented for a mayoral candidate) propelled him to such popularity. In 1957, he lost to Sarto Fournier who was backed by the Premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis, but Drapeau was elected again in the election of 1960 at the helm of his newly formed Civic Party&quot;.&quot; He was re-elected without interruption until he retired from political life in 1986. By the end of the decade, Montreal was a virtual one-party state, with Drapeau and his party only facing nominal opposition in City Hall.

During Drapeau&#x27;s tenure as mayor, he initiated the construction of the Montreal Metro mass transit subway system with trains running on whisper quiet rubber wheels, Place des Arts, and Expo 67, the universal exposition of 1967. To support the expenditures, Drapeau created the first public lottery in Canada in 1968, which he called simply a &quot;voluntary tax&quot;, an idea that would later gain favour and become enlarged by the provincial government by creating Loto-Québec corporation in 1970.
The 1970s were busy times for the preparation of the 1976 Summer Olympics. Cost overruns and scandals forced the Quebec government to take over the project eight months before the Games opened. Almost a year after the Games had ended, Quebec Premier René Lévesque appointed a commission to investigate the high cost overruns of the games, led by Quebec supreme court judge Albert Malouf. The inquiry found that Drapeau had made some serious and costly mistakes. The debt taken on by the city under Drapeau, coupled with a crime wave as young upstarts challenged the mafia that controlled the city&#x27;s underworld, helped lead to the Murray-Hill riot, unrest caused by a wildcat strike by the Montreal police over pay on 7 October 1969.
Drapeau retired ahead of the 1986 elections. 
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed Drapeau to the position of Canadian ambassador to UNESCO in Paris.

Despite the nationalism of his youth, Drapeau remained neutral during the 1980 Quebec referendum.

In 1967, Drapeau was made a Companion of the Order of Canada and received the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada&#x27;s gold medal. He was named a Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1987.

One of the biggest parks in Montreal, Parc Jean-Drapeau, composed of Notre Dame Island and Saint Helen&#x27;s Island in the middle of the Saint Lawrence River, site of the universal exposition of 1967, was renamed in his honour, as was the Metro station serving the park.

Drapeau was also instrumental in the demolition of the historic Van Horne Mansion on Sherbrooke street; a classic greystone house built in 1869 for John Hamilton, president of the Merchant&#x27;s Bank of Montreal. The building was controversially bulldozed in the middle of the night by developer David Azrieli in 1973 under the mayoralty of Drapeau, who declared that it was impossible to preserve it for cultural reasons because it was not part of Quebec&#x27;s culture - Hamilton and Van Horne being Anglophone Quebecers (Hamilton was from Ontario and Van Horne was American). It was replaced by a sixteen-storey concrete tower. The mansion&#x27;s destruction sparked the creation of the heritage preservation group Save Montreal. Journalist William Weintraub includes the house and its demolition in his 1993 documentary, &quot;The Rise and Fall of English Montreal&quot;, identifying the significance of the building to the local Anglo community&#x27;s heritage.

After several health concerns, Drapeau announced his retirement from politics in 1986.

==Health concerns and death==
In July 1982, Drapeau suffered a stroke that caused paralysis to the left side of his body. In December 1985, his vertebra was fractured. After retiring in 1986, Drapeau lived a quiet life. He died in 1999 and is buried at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

<doc id="262229" wikidata="Q125029" url="?curid=262229" title="Louis de Buade de Frontenac">
<text>Louis de Buade, Comte de Frontenac et de Palluau (; 22 May 162228 November 1698) was a French soldier, courtier, and Governor General of New France in North America from 1672 to 1682, and again from 1689 to his death in 1698. He established a number of Forts on the Great Lakes and engaged in a series of battles against the English and the Iroquois.

In his first term, he supported the expansion of the fur trade, establishing Fort Frontenac (in what is now Kingston, Ontario) and came into conflict with the other members of the Sovereign Council over its expansion and over the corvée that were required to build the new forts. In particular, despite the opposition of Bishop François de Laval, he supported selling brandy to the aboriginal tribes, which Laval considered a mortal sin. The conflict with the Sovereign Council led to his recall in 1682.

His second term was characterised by the defence of Quebec from an English invasion during King William&#x27;s War, a successful campaign against Iroquois and English settlements that resulted in the elimination of the Iroquois threat against New France and a large expansion of the fur trade using Canadian &quot;coureurs des bois&quot;. He died before his second recall to France.

==Early life==
Frontenac was born in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, the son of Henri de Buade, colonel in the regiment of Navarre, and Anne Phélypeaux, daughter of Raymond Phélypeaux. The details of his early life are meager, as no trace of the Frontenac papers has been discovered. The de Buades, however, were a family of distinction in the principality of Béarn. Antoine de Buade, seigneur de Frontenac, grandfather of the future governor of New France, attained eminence as a councilor of state under Henri IV; and his children were brought up with the dauphin, afterwards Louis XIII.

Frontenac entered the army at an early age. In 1635 he began his military career and he served under the prince of Orange in Holland, and fought with credit and received many injuries during engagements in the Low Countries and in Italy. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in the regiment of Normandy in 1643, and three years later, after distinguishing himself at the siege of Orbetello, where he had an arm broken, he was made maréchal de camp. In the 17th century, warfare ceased during the winter months, and Frontenac, being a soldier, needed to keep occupied. Like many military officers, Frontenac took residence at the King&#x27;s court. Such a lavish lifestyle proved to be costly, and his time at the King&#x27;s court only led him to amass more debt. His growing debt led him to seek an arrêt du Conseil d&#x27;état later in his life to protect his properties from his creditors, who otherwise would have been able to seize them.
His service seems to have been continuous until the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, when he returned to his father&#x27;s house in Paris and married, without the consent of her parents, Anne de la Grange-Trianon in October 1648. Frontenac courted her because she was set to inherit a large sum of money from her deceased mother and her father upon his death. Anne de la Grange-Trianon&#x27;s father had remarried and had a second child to ensure that his fortune would not go to his daughter and the son-in-law that he disapproved of. Therefore, when Frontenac&#x27;s father-in-law died, Frontenac did not receive the money he was hoping for as his wife&#x27;s father left his fortune to his new wife. The marriage was not a happy one, and after the birth of a son incompatibility of temper led to a separation, the count retiring to his estate on the Indre, where by an extravagant course of living, he became hopelessly in debt. Little is known of his career for the next fifteen years beyond the fact that he held a high position at court, but in 1669, when France sent a contingent to assist the Venetians in the defense of Crete against the Ottomans, Frontenac was placed in command of the troops on the recommendation of Turenne. In that expedition he won military glory, but his fortune was not improved.

In 1664, Frontenac admitted to owing debt of 325,878 livres, plus 17,350 livres of interest to his creditors, which had not been repaid by 1672, when his property was seized by creditors. Frontenac, however, was offered the position of governor-general of New France which deferred his debts until the end of his governorship. Frontenac was appointed governor and lieutenant general of New France, Acadia, the island of Newfoundland on 6 April 1672 and arrived in Quebec on 7 September that same year.

A 17th-century painting of Anne de la Grange-Trianon can be seen at the Château de Versailles.

==First term in New France==
At this period the affairs of New France claimed the unexpected attention of the French court. From the year 1665 the colony had been successfully administered by three men: Daniel de Rémy de Courcelle, the governor, Jean Talon, the intendant, and the Marquis de Tracy, who had been appointed lieutenant general for the French king in America; but a difference of opinion had arisen between the governor and the intendant, and each had demanded the other&#x27;s recall in the public interest. At this crisis in the administration of New France, Frontenac was appointed to succeed Rémy de Courcelle.

From the beginning of Frontenac&#x27;s term, it was evident that he was prepared to effect a policy of colonial expansion. He was also anxious to inaugurate an era of prosperity for Canada. He exercised an independence of action that did not coincide with the views of his minister Colbert. As governor, Frontenac was the most powerful figure within the colony. Among his most prominent duties as governor, Frontenac maintained control over military matters and foreign affairs. Situated within the context of the French colony throughout the seventeenth century, foreign affairs largely encompassed the relations between French settlers and indigenous peoples. Although the governor was not allowed to intervene in matters handled by the Sovereign Council and the intendant, persons in these formal posts had to respect the governor as the ultimate voice of authority. Such compliance was based on the notion that the governor was the king&#x27;s representative. The governor was not merely an intermediary or a stand-in. The governor extended the king&#x27;s authority from France to the North American colony. As one of his first acts as governor, he established his presence as the sovereign delegate of the king by establishing in Canada the three estates – nobles, clergy and people – and convening a colonial Estates General to pledge fealty to him. The arrival of the governor implied that all of the colony&#x27;s settlers pledge allegiance to the king. Frontenac did not take this lightly. The royal policy, however, was averse to the granting of extensive political rights to the Canadians, and Frontenac&#x27;s reforms in this direction were disapproved. In relation to the hierarchy of authority within the colonial setting, any check on the governor&#x27;s power was absent. In Frontenac&#x27;s case, France&#x27;s finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who resided in France, could only impose restraints upon the governor&#x27;s powers. Thus, measures were adopted to curb his ambition by increasing the power of the Sovereign Council and by reviving the office of intendant. Responding to his reduction in the Sovereign Council to a figurehead, he expressed his infuriation by challenging the authority of the intendant, Jacques Duchesnau and demanding that the council refer to him as the &quot;chief and president&quot;.

Frontenac, was a dominant man, jealous of authority, prepared to exact obedience from all and to yield to none. In the course of events he soon became involved in quarrels with the intendant touching questions of precedence and with the ecclesiastics, one or two of whom ventured to criticize his proceedings. The church in New France had been administered for many years by the religious orders; for the see of Quebec, so long contemplated, had not yet been erected. But three years after the arrival of Frontenac, a former vicar apostolic, François-Xavier de Montmorency-Laval, returned to Quebec as bishop, with a jurisdiction over the whole of New France. The governor found a vigorous opponent in Laval, who was determined to render the state subordinate to the church. Frontenac, following in this respect in the footsteps of his predecessors, had issued trading licenses which permitted the sale of intoxicants. The bishop, supported by the intendant, tried to suppress this trade and sent an ambassador to France to obtain remedial action. The views of the bishop were upheld and authority was divided. Troubles ensued between the governor and the Sovereign Council, over its expansion and over the corvées required to build the new forts. In particular, despite the opposition of the bishop, he supported selling brandy to the First Nations, which Laval considered a mortal sin. The king and his minister had to listen to and adjudicate upon the appeals from the contending parties until one incident tried their patience. After the adolescent son of Duchesneau was verbally abused on the street by a follower of Frontenac, he physically assaulted him with his cane when Frontenac deemed his explanation unacceptable and, after negotiation between himself, the intendant and the bishop, an officer of Frontenac detained and imprisoned Duchesneau&#x27;s son. Under the king&#x27;s edict of 1679, it was forbidden for a governor to arbitrarily imprison any subjects. After a deliberation in Versailles, both governor and intendant were recalled to France in the year 1682.

During Frontenac&#x27;s first administration many improvements had been made in the country. The defenses had been strengthened, a fort was built at Cataraqui (now Kingston, Ontario), bearing the governor&#x27;s name, and conditions of peace had been fairly maintained between the Iroquois on the one hand and the French and their allies, the Ottawas and the Hurons, on the other. Frontenac made his way to Cataraqui to build his post that would facilitate trading with the Iroquois Confederacy. Even though Frontenac was disobeying Colbert&#x27;s policies, he was able to continuously act in such a way because he represented the king. Throughout his first term, Frontenac was engaging in the fur trade to increase his own fortune and those of his associates. According to La Salle&#x27;s personal memoir, Frontenac was also trying to secure a monopoly over a large part of the fur trade. The progress of events during the next few years proved that the recall of the governor had been ill-timed. The Iroquois were assuming a threatening attitude towards the inhabitants, and Frontenac&#x27;s successor, La Barre, was quite incapable of leading an army against such foes. At the end of a year, La Barre was replaced by the Marquis de Denonville, a man of ability and courage, who, though he showed some vigour in marching against the western Iroquois tribes, angered rather than intimidated them, and the massacre of Lachine on 5 August 1689 must be regarded as one of the unhappy results of his administration.

==Second term in New France==

The affairs of the colony were now critical. A man of experience and decision was needed to cope with the difficulties, and Louis XIV, chose Frontenac to represent and uphold the power of France. When on 17 October 1689, Frontenac arrived in Quebec as governor for the second time, he received an enthusiastic welcome, and confidence was at once restored in the public mind. Quebec was not long to enjoy peace.

Frontenac&#x27;s return to New France during the Nine Years&#x27; War offered him an opportunity to display his military capabilities against England in North America. Despite the tensions created during his first term as governor-general, Frontenac was still unwilling to share power with the Sovereign Council and continued to profit from the Canadian fur trade. In January 1690, Frontenac approved the use of raiding parties composed of French and Indigenous raiders to attack English border settlements. The parties raided the towns of Schenectady and Salmon Falls and murdered English colonists, but spared the Iroquois. The raids were intended to deter the English from forming an alliance with the Iroquois, but instead united the English colonies against New France. On October 16, 1690, several New England ships under the command of Sir William Phips, governor of Massachusetts, appeared off l&#x27;Île d&#x27;Orléans, and an officer was sent ashore to demand the surrender of the fort. Frontenac, bold and fearless, responded with the famous words: &quot;Non, je n&#x27;ai point de réponse à faire à votre général que par la bouche de mes canons et de mes fusils.&quot; (&quot;No, I have no reply to make to your general other than from the mouths of my cannons and muskets.&quot;). In the ensuing Battle 
 of Quebec, Frontenac&#x27;s forces completely repulsed the English, who in their hasty retreat left behind a few pieces of artillery on the Beauport shore.

The prestige of the governor was increased by this event, and he was prepared to follow up his advantage by an attack on Boston from the sea, but his resources were inadequate. New France now rejoiced in a brief respite from her enemies, and during the interval Frontenac paid some attention to the social life of the colony and encouraged the revival of drama at the Chateau St-Louis.

New France had been under intermittent attack throughout the 17th century. The people, however, were not subdued and for two years after the Phips attack, petty warfare was maintained. The sufferings of the colony, infested by war parties, were extreme. The fur trade, which formed its only resource for subsistence, was completely cut off, and a great accumulation of furs remained in the trading posts of the upper lakes, prevented from descending by the watchful enemy. To meet the threat, he dispatched Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes to establish a trading post and fort at Kekionga, present day Fort Wayne, Indiana. At a grand council of the friendly tribes, Frontenac took up a hatchet, brandished it in the air, and sang the war song, his officers following his example. The Christian Indians of the neighboring missions rose and joined them, and so did the Hurons and the Algonquins of Lake Nipissing, while Frontenac led the dance, whooping like the rest. His allies promised war to the death, and several years of conflict followed. After three years of destitution and misery, Frontenac broke the blockade of the Ottawa; the coveted treasure came safely to Montreal, and the colonists hailed him as their father and deliverer.
In 1696 Frontenac decided to take the field against the Iroquois, although at this time he was 74 years old. On July 6, he left Lachine as the head of a considerable force for the village of the Onondagas, where he arrived a month later. In the meantime, the Iroquois had abandoned their villages, and as pursuit was impracticable, the army commenced its return march on August 10. Frontenac endured the march as well as the youngest soldier, and for his courage and prowess he received the cross of St. Louis. Under Frontenac&#x27;s leadership, arranged to provide all militiamen with clothing and equipment. This consisted generally of a capote, a breechcloth, leggings, a blanket, moccasins, a knife and two shirts, The clothing did not constitute a military uniform but was simply Canadian-style civilian wear. Since these men were not paid, this was a relatively economical way of maintaining an effective militia, the Canadian militia became increasingly adept at guerrilla warfare and took the war into Iroquois territory and attacked a number of English settlements. After waging a war of attrition between 1690 and 1698, the Iroquois fled the raided territory and negotiated for peace with the French. The result was that the threat of the Iroquois to New France was finally diffused.

At the time of his second appointment as governor in 1689, France authorized the importation of enslaved Africans to Quebec from French colonies in the West Indies.

Frontenac died on 28 November 1698 at the Chateau St-Louis after a brief illness and was deeply mourned by the Canadian people. The faults of the governor were those of temperament. His nature was turbulent, and from his youth he had been used to command, but underlying a rough exterior there was evidence of a kindly heart. He was fearless, resourceful and decisive, and triumphed as few men could have done over the difficulties and dangers of a most critical position.

<doc id="262230" wikidata="Q2834684" url="?curid=262230" title="Sorley Boy MacDonnell">
<text>Somhairle Buíodh MacDonnell (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Somhairle Buidhe Mac Domhnaill&quot;), known as Sorley Boy MacDonnell, whose last name was also given as MacDonald (c. 1505 – 1590), was a Gaelic chief, the son of Alexander Carragh MacDonnell, 5th of Dunnyveg, of Dunyvaig Castle, lord of Islay and Cantire, and Catherine, daughter of the Lord of Ardnamurchan, both in Scotland. MacDonnell is best known for establishing the MacDonnell clan in Antrim, Ireland, and resisting the campaign of Shane O&#x27;Neill and the English crown to expel the clan from Ireland. Sorley Boy&#x27;s connection to other Irish Roman Catholic lords was complicated, but also culturally and familiarly strong: for example, he married Mary O&#x27;Neill, the daughter of Conn O&#x27;Neill. He is also known in English as Somerled and Somerled of the yellow hair.

MacDonnell could neither read nor write. When signing documents, his mark was authenticated by his secretary&#x27;s signature alongside of it.

== Clan MacDonnell ==
The MacDonnells of Antrim were a sept of the powerful Clan Donald of the royal Clann Somhairle, &quot;(see Lords of the Isles)&quot;, that the English crown had attempted to cultivate since the early 14th century in its efforts to influence the course of politics in Scotland. At the end of that century an ancestor of Sorley&#x27;s, John Mór Tanister, had married Margaret Bisset, of the lordship on the Antrim coast known as the Glynns or Glens, which union would eventually lay the basis for Sorley Boy&#x27;s claim to the lordship of that territory in Ireland. MacDonnell migration to the Glynns and Rathlin Island increased in the early 16th century (by way of swift galleys propelled by oar and sail), after the clan had rejected overtures from an increasingly powerful James IV, King of Scotland. However, the last known lord of the Mac Eoin Bissetts, a supporter of the O&#x27;Neills, was slain in battle in 1522, and it is only after this that the MacDonnells somehow emerge as claimants to the lordship. The precise circumstances of this transfer or encroachment have been lost to history, but the English authorities, themselves preparing to claim overlordship in Ulster and the rest of Ireland, still recognised the Bissetts as the lords of the Glynns as late as 1515.

The English feared the formation of a fifth column, with the Ulster clans of O&#x27;Neill and O&#x27;Donnell, which might lay the foundation of a Bruce-style invasion of Ireland, and the clan did spread into the adjacent territories of Clandeboy and the Route. This migration from Scotland was cemented when the king&#x27;s successor, James V, chose to maintain favourable relations with the rival Clan Campbell, although he did swing around to favour the MacDonnells in the 1530s, restoring certain lands to them in Kintyre and Islay while encouraging their expansion in Ireland. This period of royal favour ended with the defeat in 1539 at the Battle of Belahoe of a combined Irish force (including the MacDonnells) by an English army: Scottish plans for an invasion of Ireland were then put off, while the French invasion of England that King Henry VIII had feared failed to occur.

== Military leader ==
Once the invasion crisis had passed, the MacDonnells resisted efforts by the English and Scots governments to drive them from their lands in the Western Isles of Scotland and Ulster in Ireland.

Sorley Boy was born at Dunanynie Castle near Ballycastle, County Antrim in Ireland, and came to prominence during the mid-to-late 16th century, when the Dublin administration waged periodic campaigns in the Route. During the first campaign in 1550, Sorley Boy was taken prisoner and confined in Dublin Castle for twelve months, and was finally released in exchange for certain prisoners held by his brother, James, who was leader of the clan.

After his release, Sorley Boy received a large ransom upon seizing the constable of Carrickfergus Castle, and went on to subjugate the MacQuillans. This clan was the immediate rival of the MacDonnells in Ireland, dominating the northern portion of Antrim – the Route – with their stronghold at Dunluce Castle, near the mouth of the River Bush. In 1558, the MacDonnell chieftain committed to him the lordship of the Route upon the death of his brother Colla, and Sorley Boy promptly raised a force of troops on the Scottish coast to confront the MacQuillans, former allies of the MacDonell clan. He landed at Marketon Bay in July 1559, where the MacQuillans were strongly posted at the foot of Glenshesk, his camp at Bonamargy was attacked with both suffering heavy losses. Sorley then attacked them at Beal a Faula, driving them south with heavy losses. Several bloody encounters followed, where the MacQuillans were defeated and driven from the Route.

Sorley Boy was now too powerful and turbulent to be neglected by Queen Elizabeth and her ministers, who were also being troubled by his great contemporary, Shane O&#x27;Neill. For the next twenty years, the history of Ulster consists for the most part of alternating conflict and alliance between MacDonnells and O&#x27;Neills, and attempts on the part of the English government to subdue them both. With this object Elizabeth aimed at fomenting the rivalry between the two clans; she came to terms sometimes with one and sometimes with the other. One event that simplified the situation for the queen was the success in 1560 of the Protestant revolution in Scotland, which largely removed the threat of invasion her father had suffered in 1539. But complications were never wanting in Ulster, owing to the criss-cross of dynastic and political allegiances and betrayals. At this time Shane O&#x27;Neill was allied by marriage with the Campbells, the MacDonnell clan&#x27;s chief rival in Scotland; yet Sorley Boy&#x27;s wife was a half-sister of the same Shane.

== Clan chief ==
Upon Elizabeth&#x27;s accession in 1559 Sorley Boy had submitted to her authority under Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, then Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and in return was confirmed in his Irish possessions.
In 1562 Shane O&#x27;Neill paid his celebrated visit to London, where he obtained recognition by Elizabeth of his claims as head of the O&#x27;Neills. But in 1563, Sussex mounted a campaign against O&#x27;Neill, in which Sorley Boy played his part. Sussex retired in frustration, and O&#x27;Neill entered into a sustained offensive against the MacDonnells, ostensibly in the interests of ridding the English of Scottish interference in Ireland: he defeated Sorley Boy near Coleraine in the summer of 1564, laying waste his territory; in 1565 he invaded the Glynns, destroying all Scottish settlements there, and at the Battle of Glentasie he won a decisive victory, in which James MacDonnell and Sorley Boy were taken prisoner and Dunluce Castle fell into O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s hands.

James died soon afterwards, but Sorley Boy remained O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s captive until 1567, during which period he seems to have won his captor&#x27;s confidence. After his unexpected defeat by the O&#x27;Donnells in the battle of Farsetmore, O&#x27;Neill turned to the MacDonnells for assistance and attended a feast laid on by them at Cushendun, bringing with him out of captivity Sorley Boy and his late brother&#x27;s widow, Agnes, to secure an alliance with the Scots. In an event which seems to have had the approbation of the lord deputy of Ireland, Henry Sidney, O&#x27;Neill was stabbed and murdered by his hosts. Sorley Boy visited Scotland immediately and returned to Marketon Bay with 600 redshanks, in whose presence he swore never to leave Ireland.

In 1569, an alliance between the O&#x27;Neills and MacDonnells was secured upon the marriage on Rathlin Island of Shane&#x27;s successor, Turlough Lynagh O&#x27;Neill, to the widow Agnes. Sorley Boy spent the next few years striving to frustrate the schemes of Sir Thomas Smith, and later of the Earl of Essex, for colonising Ulster with English settlers. (See Plantations of Ireland for details). He was willing to come to terms with the government provided his claims to the lands were allowed, but Essex determined to reduce him to unconditional submission. After a retreat into Scotland, Sorley Boy returned and made an unsuccessful attempt on the crown garrison at Carrickfergus. In time, he did come to terms with Smith, who supported his claims to title in the Route on condition that he take up the reformed religion. In 1573, letters of denization were addressed to Sorley Boy from the crown, but Essex frustrated these with the renewal of his plantation scheme; still, Sorley Boy managed to hold his position, when Essex failed in his negotiation with the Scottish regent and the Earl of Argyll of a withdrawal of the Scots from Ulster.

Essex then switched tack, having struck a deal with Turlough Lynagh, and defeated Sorley Boy around Castle Toome, where the Bann flows out of Lough Neagh. Essex had to withdraw to Carrickfergus for lack of provisions, but he then ordered a follow-up operation, with the intention of driving the Scots from Ulster. Under the commands of John Norris and Francis Drake an amphibious strike force proceeded by sea from Carrickfergus to Rathlin Island, where Sorley Boy&#x27;s children and valuables, together with the families of his principal retainers, had been lodged for safety; and while the chieftain was himself at Ballycastle, within sight of the island, its garrison along with civilians hiding on it were massacred by Norris&#x27; troops. Sorley Boy retaliated with a successful raid on Carrickfergus, in which the garrison broke before a highland charge, and managed to partly re-establish his power in the Glynns and the Route.

In 1583, taking advantage of Sorley&#x27;s perceived weakness through the absence of a significant number of MacDonnell warriors, who had been hired by Turlough Lynagh for a campaign in the west, the Mac Quillans made their last great attempt to decisively defeat the MacDonnells and recover the Route. In alliance with Sir Hugh MacPhelim Bacagh O&#x27;Neill of Edenduffcarrick (Shane&#x27;s Castle, Randalstown) and accompanied by two companies of English musketeers &#x27;sent from the pale&#x27; and commanded by the newly appointed Senechel of Clandeboye, Captain Chatterton, the Mac Quillans launched a devastating raid on the northern glens. Sorley assembled a small force which threatened the main camp of the raiders sited on a broad ridge near Slieve na Orra. The cavalry and heavy infantry of the raiders were tricked into charging the small, apparently vulnerable, MacDonnell host across what they believed to be sound ground but what was in fact a deep bog, where they were incapacitated and decisively defeated by the MacDonnells. Hugh Mac Phelim and Chatterton fled, but were hunted down and killed near the summit of Orra while Rory Oge MacQuillan sought refuge on a crannog at Loughgile, where he was killed by a pursuer. This action is called the battle of Slieve-an-aura and has been inaccurately dated to 1559 by a number of sources, following Rev. George Hill&#x27;s history, &quot;The MacDonnells of Antrim&quot;. The accurate date has been preserved in the State Papers for Ireland.

On surveying the results, Lord Deputy Sidney agreed to a ceasefire, although he supported the claims of the MacQuillans to the Route, and of Sorley Boy&#x27;s nephews (sons of the widow Agnes) to possession of the Glens – a typical Campbell manoeuvre, effected through their alliance with Turlough Lynagh. At the same time, Sidney forwarded to London Sorley Boy&#x27;s petition for title, although it sat there without response for years. With fortitude, the MacDonnells managed to strengthen their position through an alliance with Turlough Lynagh, and by a formidable immigration of followers from the Scottish Isles following their decisive victory at Aura.

== Ambition achieved ==
For some years the politics of eastern Ulster were maintained in a balance. But in 1584 the recently arrived lord deputy of Ireland, Sir John Perrot, led his army into the province in a determined effort to dislodge the Scots. Following an expedition to Scotland in search of reinforcements, Sorley Boy landed at Cushendun in January 1585 with a substantial army, but after initial successes, he was driven back to Scotland, where he offered to accept the terms formerly put to him by Sidney; Perrot declined, whereupon Sorley Boy returned and regained possession of Dunluce Castle. Perrot reluctantly opened negotiations with Sorley Boy, sending as his emissary Sir William Warren, whose father Humphrey had been on good terms with Sorley during Sussex&#x27;s Deputyship. Warren persuaded Sorley to come to terms, and in the summer of 1586, he repaired to Dublin and made submission to Elizabeth&#x27;s representative. When shown the severed head of his son, which had been nailed above the gate of Dublin Castle, Sorley Boy gave the memorable response, &quot;My son hath many heads&quot;. Below is a transcription of the submission to Sir John Perrot.

The name Sorley uses above is akin to the modern surname &quot;McConnell&quot; being the Gaelic pronunciation of the name &quot;Mac Domhnaill.&quot; Having made his submission, Sorley Boy at last obtained a grant to himself and his heirs of the greater part of the Route country, between the rivers Bann and Bush (an area then called the Boys), with certain other lands to the east, and was made constable of Dunluce Castle. A month beforehand, Sorley Boy&#x27;s nephew had received a grant in similar terms of the greater part of the Glynns. At the same time, in the Treaty of Berwick, a clause was inserted recognizing the right of the Clan MacDonnell to remain in Ireland.

Sorley Boy gave no further trouble to the English government, although he did assist survivors of the Spanish Armada to escape Ireland in 1588 (see Girona). He died in 1590 at the place of his birth, the Castle of Dunanynie, and was buried in the traditional place of the MacDonnells, Bonamargy Friary at Ballycastle.

== Legacy ==
Prior to the Plantation of Ulster in 1610, Sorley Boy had been the most powerful of the province&#x27;s Scoto-Irish. Owing to his efforts, successive Tudor and Stuart administrations in England and Scotland were presented with ongoing strategic difficulties in the region of east Ulster and southwest Scotland. During the previous forty years, he had played those difficulties with courage, skill and deception, to the point that MacDonnell&#x27;s claims were largely accepted and the clan&#x27;s fortunes secured.

== Family ==
With his first wife, Mary, daughter of Conn O&#x27;Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone, their children were:
*Alaster MacDonnell, Killed in battle in 1585
*Donnell MacDonnell
*James MacDonnell, Died on 13 April 1601 at Dunluce Castle
*Randal MacDonnell Earl of Antrim d. 10 December 1636
*Angus MacDonnell
*Ludar MacDonnell
*unknown daughter married a chief of Clan Macnaghten
*unknown daughter married a chief of Clan McQuillan
*unknown daughter married Cormack O&#x27;Neill
*unknown daughter married Magennis, Lord of Iveagh
*unknown daughter married Shane O&#x27;Neill of Clandeboye

In 1588, when he was past the age of eighty years, his second wife was a daughter of Turlough Luineach O&#x27;Neill, a kinswoman of his first wife.

Two of his five daughters married members of the O&#x27;Neill family. By his first marriage Sorley Boy had several sons (known as the MacSorleys): two were killed, and Randal, who was created earl of Antrim, is the ancestor of the present holder of that title. It was to Randal that King James I renewed the grants of the Route and the Glynns.
