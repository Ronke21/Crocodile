<text>The Battle of Magnesia took place in either December 190 or January 189 BC. It was fought as part of the Roman–Seleucid War, pitting forces of the Roman Republic led by the consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus and the allied Kingdom of Pergamon under Eumenes II against a Seleucid army of Antiochus III the Great. The two armies initially camped northeast of Magnesia ad Sipylum in Asia Minor (modern-day Manisa, Turkey), attempting to provoke each other into a battle on favorable terrain for several days.

When the battle finally began, Eumenes managed to throw the Seleucid left flank into disarray. While Antiochus&#x27; cavalry overpowered his adversaries on the right flank of the battlefield, his army&#x27;s center collapsed before he could reinforce it. Modern estimates give 10,000 dead for the Seleucids and 5,000 killed for the Romans. The battle resulted in a decisive Roman-Pergamene victory, which led to the Treaty of Apamea that ended Seleucid domination in Asia Minor.

==Background==
Following his return from his Bactrian (210-209 BC) and Indian (206-205 BC) campaigns, Antiochus forged an alliance with Philip V of Macedon, seeking to jointly conquer the territories of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. In 198 BC, he was victorious in the Fifth Syrian War, taking over Coele-Syria and securing his southeastern border. He then focused his attention on Asia Minor, launching a successful campaign against coastal Ptolemaic possessions. In 196 BC, Antiochus used the opportunity of Attalus I&#x27;s death to assault cities controlled by the Attalid dynasty. Fearing that Antiochus would seize the entirety of Asia Minor, the independent cities of Smyrna and Lampsacus appealed for protection from the Roman Republic. In the early spring of 196 BC, Antiochus&#x27; troops crossed to the European side of the Hellespont and began rebuilding the strategically important city of Lysimachia. In October 196 BC, Antiochus met with a delegation of Roman diplomats in Lysimachia. The Romans demanded that Antiochus withdraw from Europe and restore the autonomous status of Greek city-states in Asia Minor. Antiochus countered by claiming that he was simply rebuilding the empire of his ancestor Antiochus II Theos and criticized the Romans for meddling in the affairs of the Asia Minor states whose rights were traditionally defended by Rhodes.

In late winter 196/195 BC, Rome&#x27;s erstwhile chief enemy, Carthaginian general Hannibal, fled from Carthage to Antiochus&#x27; court in Ephesus. Despite the emergence of a pro-war party led by Scipio Africanus, the Roman Senate exercised restraint. The Seleucids expanded their holdings in Thrace from Perinthus to Maroneia at the expense of the Thracian tribesmen. Negotiations between the Romans and the Seleucids resumed, coming to a standstill once again over differences between Greek and Roman law on the status of disputed territorial possessions. In the summer of 193 BC, a representative of the Aetolian League assured Antiochus that the Aetolians would take his side in a future war with Rome, while Antiochus gave tacit support to Hannibal&#x27;s plans of launching an anti-Roman coup d&#x27;état in Carthage.
The Aetolians began spurring the Greek states to jointly revolt under Antiochus&#x27; leadership against the Romans, hoping to provoke a war between the two parties. The Aetolians then captured the strategically important port city of Demetrias, killing the key members of the local pro-Roman faction. In September 192 BC, the Aetolian general Thoantas arrived at Antiochus&#x27; court, convincing him to openly oppose the Romans in Greece. The Seleucids raised 10,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, 6 war elephants, and 300 ships for their campaign in Greece.

==Prelude==
The Seleucid fleet sailed via Imbros and Skiathos, arriving at Demetrias where Antiochus&#x27; army disembarked. The Achaean League declared war on the Seleucids and Aetolians with the Romans following suit in November 192 BC. Antiochus forced Chalcis to open its gates to him, turning the city into his base of operations. Antiochus then shifted his attention towards rebuilding his alliance with Philip V of Macedon, which had been shattered after the latter was decisively defeated by the Romans at the Battle of Cynoscephalae in 197 BC. Philip expected that the Romans would emerge victorious in the conflict and counted on territorial rewards as well as the writing off of war reparations that he owed them; the Seleucids could provide neither, so Antiochus&#x27; overtures were rejected and Philip aligned himself with the Romans. Between December 192 and March 191 BC, Antiochus campaigned in Thessaly and Acarnania.

A combined counter-offensive conducted by the Romans and their Macedonian allies erased all of Antiochus&#x27; gains in Thessaly within a month. On 26 April 191 BC, the two sides faced off at the Battle of Thermopylae, where Antiochus&#x27; army suffered a devastating defeat and he returned to Ephesus shortly afterwards. The Seleucids then attempted to destroy the Roman fleet before it could unite with those of Rhodes and the Attalids. However, the Roman fleet defeated the Seleucids in the Battle of Corycus in September 191 BC, enabling it to take control of several cities including Dardanus and Sestos on the Hellespont. In May 190 BC, Antiochus invaded Pergamon, ravaging the countryside, besieging its capital and forcing Eumenes to return from Greece. In August 190 BC, the Rhodians defeated Hannibal&#x27;s fleet at the Battle of the Eurymedon. A month later a combined Roman-Rhodean fleet defeated the Seleucids at the Battle of Myonessus. The Seleucids could no longer control the Aegean Sea, opening the way for a Roman invasion of Asia Minor. Antiochus withdrew his armies from Thrace, while simultaneously offering to cover half of the Roman war expenses and accept the demands made in Lysimachia in 196 BC. By this time, however, the Romans were determined to crush the Seleucids once and for all. As the Roman forces reached Maroneia, Antiochus began preparing for a final decisive battle. The Romans advanced through Dardanus to the River Caecus where they united with Eumenes’ army.

==Armies==

The two main historical accounts of the battle come from Livy’s &quot;Ab Urbe Condita Libri&quot; and Appian’s &quot;Syriaca&quot;. Both of these authors agree that the Roman army was about 30,000 men strong and the Seleucids fielded approximately 72,000 soldiers. However, modern historians disagree on the issue, with some believing the estimates in the primary sources, while others claim that the two armies might have each numbered some 50,000 men. Additionally, the Romans had 16 war elephants at their disposal, while the Seleucids fielded 54. A popular anecdote regarding the array of the two armies is that Antiochus supposedly asked Hannibal whether his vast and well-armed formation would be enough for the Roman Republic, to which Hannibal tartly replied, &quot;Quite enough for the Romans, however greedy they are.&quot;

The left wing of the Seleucids was commanded by Antiochus&#x27; son Seleucus and his nephew Antipater. It was composed of Cyrtian slingers and Elymaean archers, 4,000 , 1,500 Illyrians, 1,500 Carians and Cilicians, and 1,000 Neocretans. The rest of the left wing consisted of 2,500 Galatian and 500 Tarentine light cavalry, 1,000 royal cavalry, 3,000 cataphracts, 2,000 Cappadocian infantry, 16 war elephants, and a miscellaneous force of 2,700 light infantry. The center was formed by a 16,000-strong Macedonian phalanx, commanded by Philip, the master of the elephants. It was deployed into ten 1,600-man , each 50 men wide and 32 men deep. Twenty war elephants were separated into pairs and deployed in the gaps between the , further supported by 1,500 Galatian and 1,500 Atian infantry. The right flank was led by Antiochus, consisting of 3,000 cataphracts, 1,000 cavalry, 1,000 of the royal guard, 1,200 Dahae horse archers. 2,500 Mysian archers, 3,000 Cretan and Illyrian light infantry, 4,500 Cyrtian slingers and Elymaean archers as well as a reserve of 16 war elephants. Ahead of the main body, units of scythed chariots and a unit of camel-borne Arab archers were posted in front of the left flank, and to their immediate right, Minnionas and Zeuxis commanded 6,000 light infantry. The war camp was guarded by 7,000 of the least combat-ready Seleucid troops. 

The left wing of the Romans was commanded by the legate Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus. It numbered 10,800 heavy infantrymen drawn from among the Romans and Rome&#x27;s Socii, along with four cavalry companies of 100 to 120 men. The center likewise consisted of 10,800 Roman and Latin heavy infantrymen commanded personally by Scipio. The Roman infantry was divided into three lines, with the youngest soldiers standing at the front, in a more open and flexible formation than their adversaries. The right flank was led by Eumenes and comprised 2,800 to 3,000 cavalry, the majority being Romans supplemented by an 800-man Pergamene force. Ahead of the Roman main force were 3,000 Achaean and Pergamene light infantry and 800 Cretan and Illyrian archers. The rearguard was formed by 2,000 Thracian and Macedonian volunteers and 16 African war elephants that were considered inferior to the Asian war elephants deployed by the Seleucids.

==Battle==
The battle took place either in December 190 BC or January 189 BC. The Romans advanced from Pergamon towards Thyatira where they expected to encounter Antiochus. Antiochus was determined to fight his adversaries on the ground of his own choosing, and his army marched from the direction of Sardis towards Magnesia ad Sipylum, camping northeast of the city. Magnesia had already served as a battlefield for the Seleucids in 281 BC where they had emerged victorious in the Battle of Corupedium. Upon learning that the Seleucids had left Thyatira, the Romans marched for five days towards the River Phrygios, camping north of the River Hermos, from the Seleucid camp. Antiochus dispatched a party of 1,000 Galatian and Dahae cavalry to lure the Romans into a more exposed position, but the Romans refused to be drawn out. Three days later, the Romans moved their camp into a horseshoe-shaped plain some from the Seleucid camp, which was surrounded by the Phrygios and Hermos rivers on three sides, by which the Romans hoped to limit the effectiveness of the Seleucid cavalry. The Seleucids once again sent an elite 3,000-man detachment to harass the Romans.
During the following five days, the two armies lined up for battle, without engaging each other. Scipio found himself in a zugzwang. He could not hope to win the battle by directly assaulting the heavily-fortified Seleucid camp, but by refusing to engage he risked having his supply lines cut by the numerically-superior enemy cavalry. Turning back would have caused Roman morale to plunge as campaigns were halted during the winter. Additionally, Scipio wished to achieve a decisive victory over the Seleucids before a new consul was sent out from Rome to replace him. The Romans advanced to the point where the Phrygios made a 90-degree turn towards the north, leaving their right flank unprotected by the rivers. Antiochus was satisfied with the location, accepting the Roman challenge on the dawn of the third day after the last Roman advance.

The battle began on the Seleucid left flank when Eumenes sent forward his archers, slingers, and spearmen to harass the Seleucid scythed chariots. The latter began fleeing in panic after suffering heavy casualties, causing confusion among the camel-borne Arab archers and cataphracts positioned behind them. Eumenes then charged with his cavalry before the cataphracts could properly reorganize. The Roman and Pergamene cavalry broke through the Seleucid left flank, causing the cataphracts to flee to the Seleucid camp. The Galatians, Cappadocians, and mercenary infantry to the left of the phalanx faced a simultaneous attack from the Roman center and right, causing them to retreat and exposing the phalanx&#x27;s left flank.

On the Seleucid right flank, Antiochus led the attack with the cataphracts and cavalry facing the Latin infantry, while the engaged the Roman legionaries. The Roman infantry broke ranks retreating to their camp where they were reinforced by the Thracians and Macedonians and subsequently rallied by tribune Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Antiochus&#x27;s cavalry was unsuitable for taking the camp and he became bogged down in the fighting while his forces were badly needed elsewhere. In the center, the Seleucid phalanx held its ground against the Roman infantry, but it was not mobile enough to dislodge the enemy archers and slingers who bombarded it with projectiles. It began a slow organized retreat, when the war elephants positioned between its panicked because of the projectiles, causing the phalanx to break formation. The phalangites discarded their weapons and abandoned the battlefield. By the time Antiochus&#x27; cavalry had returned to reinforce the center his army had already dispersed. He gathered the surviving troops and retreated to Sardes while the Romans were busy looting his camp.

==Aftermath==

Antiochus&#x27; defeat at Magnesia marked the end of the Macedonian phalanx&#x27;s dominance on Hellenistic period battlefields. According to Livy 53,000 Seleucid soldiers perished, with 1,400 being captured alongside 15 elephants. By comparison, Livy claims that the Romans lost 349 men with many more wounded. Modern estimates give 10,000 dead for the Seleucids and 5,000 killed for the Romans. Shortly after arriving at Sardes, Antiochus learnt that Seleucus had survived the battle and headed to Apamea to meet him. The defeat at Magnesia and the subsequent withdrawal of the Seleucid fleet from Ephesus to Patara led the garrisons of numerous cities including Sardes, Ephesus, Thyatira, and Magnesia ad Sipylum to surrender to the Romans. Antiochus dispatched Zeuxis and Antipater to the Romans, in order to secure a truce. The truce was signed at Sardes in January 189 BC, whereupon Antiochus agreed to abandon his claims on all lands west of the Taurus Mountains, paid a heavy war indemnity and promised to hand over Hannibal and other notable enemies of Rome from among his allies.

The Romans sought to subjugate Asia Minor and punish Antiochus&#x27; allies, starting the Galatian War. In mainland Greece they suppressed the Athamanians and Aetolians who broke the terms of a previous truce. During the summer of 189 BC, ambassadors from the Seleucid Empire, Pergamon, Rhodes, and other Asia Minor states held peace talks with the Roman Senate. Lycia and Caria were given to Rhodes, while the Attalids received Thrace and most of Asia Minor west of the Taurus. The independence of Asia Minor city-states that sided with the Romans before the Battle of Magnesia was guaranteed. Antiochus further agreed to withdraw all his troops from beyond the Taurus, and refuse passage and support to enemies of Rome. The conditions also included the requirement to hand over Hannibal, Thoantas, and twenty notables as hostages, destroy all his fleet apart from ten ships, and give Rome 40,500 modiuses of grain per year. The terms were put into effect in the summer of 188 BC with the signing of the Treaty of Apamea.

<text>Charlotte Douglas International Airport is an international airport serving Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, located roughly west of the city&#x27;s central business district. Charlotte Douglas is the primary airport for commercial and military use in the Charlotte metropolitan area. Operated by the city of Charlotte&#x27;s aviation department, the airport covers 5,558 acres (2,249 ha) of land.

Established in 1935 as Charlotte Municipal Airport, the airport was later renamed as Douglas Municipal Airport for Ben Elbert Douglas Sr., who was mayor of Charlotte when the airport was first built. In 1982 the airport was renamed again, this time to its current Charlotte Douglas International Airport.

In 2019, CLT was the 11th-busiest airport in the United States in terms of passenger traffic, having processed over 50 million passengers, and fifth-busiest in terms of aircraft operations, ranking sixth globally. In 2021, CLT grew to the sixth busiest airport in the United States. Charlotte is a fortress hub for American Airlines, which operates the majority of the airport&#x27;s flights. The airport has 3 operating runways and 1 non operating runway and one passenger terminal with 124 gates across five concourses. A commercial-civil-military facility, the airport is home to the Charlotte Air National Guard base and its host unit, the 145th Airlift Wing of the North Carolina Air National Guard.

==History==
===Early years===
The city received Works Progress Administration funding to establish Charlotte&#x27;s first municipal airport; the airport was, at the time, the largest single WPA project in the United States, incorporating a terminal, hangar, beacon tower and three runways.

In 1936, Charlotte Municipal Airport opened, operated by the City of Charlotte; Eastern Air Lines began scheduled passenger service in 1937. The original passenger terminal still exists and is used for offices and training rooms by various aviation-related organizations.

The United States Army Air Forces took control of the airport and established Charlotte Air Base in early 1941, which was renamed Morris Field soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The US military invested more than $5 million in airfield improvements by the time the facility was returned to the City of Charlotte in 1946. The airfield was used by the Third Air Force for antisubmarine patrols and training.

===1950 to mid-1960s: into the jet age===
In 1954, a passenger terminal opened and the airport was renamed Douglas Municipal Airport in honor of former Charlotte Mayor Ben Elbert Douglas Sr., who had overseen the airport&#x27;s opening 20 years earlier. The terminal had two floors; passenger operations were confined to the ground floor. Ticketing and baggage claim were on each side of an open space that bisected the building north to south, and a mezzanine restaurant and airline offices overlooked this open space. Delta Air Lines began scheduled passenger service in 1956. The OAG for April 1957 shows 57 weekday departures on Eastern, 7 Piedmont, 6 Capital, 4 Delta and 2 Southern. Nonstop flights did not reach beyond Newark, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Louisville, Birmingham, and Jacksonville.

Scheduled jet flights (Eastern Air Lines Boeing 720s) began in early 1962. Eastern used the west pier, Piedmont and Delta the center pier, and United and Southern used the east pier.

===Late 1960s to 1978: before deregulation===
A major renovation project in the late 1960s expanded the facility. Eastern opened a unit terminal in 1967, replacing the old west pier. This new facility had eight dedicated gates for Eastern, each with its own departure lounge, snack bar and separate baggage claim space. Eastern passengers continued to check in at the main terminal.

In 1969, a new enclosed concourse was built parallel to the center pier. When it was completed, Piedmont, Eastern, and Delta moved in and the old center pier was demolished. The new concourse had separate departure lounges, restrooms and an enlarged baggage claim area. United&#x27;s flights continued to use the east pier, with an enclosed holding room added for waiting passengers. Eastern added two more gates to the end of its west concourse in 1973.

In April 1975, the airport had 97 weekday departures to 32 destinations on seven airlines.

===1978 to 1989: becoming a hub===
After airline deregulation, passenger numbers at the terminal nearly doubled between 1978 and 1980, and a new parallel runway and control tower opened in 1979. The airport&#x27;s master plan called for a new terminal across the runway from the existing site, with ground broken in 1979. At the time, the airport had only two concourses: one used exclusively by Eastern, and one used by other carriers, including United, Delta, Piedmont, and several commuter airlines.

In 1979, Piedmont Airlines chose Charlotte as the hub for its expanding network. A new passenger terminal designed by Odell Associates opened in 1982, and the airport was renamed Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Concourses B and C were expanded in 1987 and 1984 respectively, while Concourse A was built in 1986 to handle future growth.

In 1987, Piedmont started non-stop 767 flights to London. In the mid-1980s, the old terminal site was converted to a cargo center, and the central concourse and Eastern unit terminal were removed to make way for more cargo buildings. The original main building still stands and is used for office space. The old control tower was removed in the late 1990s. In 1989 Piedmont merged with USAir; the new merged operations kept the USAir name.

===1990 to 2013: the influence of US Airways===

In 1990, a new international and commuter concourse (Concourse D) opened, and in 1991 further expansion of the central terminal building continued, reflective of USAir&#x27;s dominating presence at the airport. A monumental bronze statue of Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (the namesake of the city), created by Raymond Kaskey, was placed in front of the main terminal.

In 1990, Lufthansa began Boeing 747 service to Germany; this service ended shortly thereafter. In 1994 British Airways began service to London via a &quot;global alliance&quot; with USAir. This was later discontinued, as British Airways formed the Oneworld Alliance and USAir become a part of the Star Alliance (although USAir later joined Oneworld prior to merging with American). Lufthansa restarted service to Charlotte in 2003 and now operates flights between Charlotte and Munich, utilizing their Airbus A350-900 fleet. Prior to March 31, 2019, Lufthansa flew their Airbus A340-600 and Airbus A330-300 aircraft on the route. Starting on July 4, 2023, and for the foreseeable future, Lufthansa will be switching the equipment on the Munich-Charlotte route and vice versa to the Airbus A340-600 from the Airbus A350-900.

In 1999, plans were announced for the construction of a regional carrier concourse (present-day Concourse E) and for the expansion of Concourses A and D. This expansion was designed by The Wilson Group and LS3P Associates Ltd. In 2002, the new 32-gate Concourse E opened. The airline closed its Concourse D US Airways Club location in 2002. In 2003, the main ticketing hall was expanded to the east, providing 13 additional ticketing counters and a new security checkpoint; Concourse D was expanded by an additional nine gates.

Following the 2005 acquisition of US Airways by America West Airlines in a reverse takeover, Charlotte remained the primary domestic hub for the airline. The majority of US Airways&#x27; international routes remained at the airline&#x27;s second-largest hub, Philadelphia.

Between 2007 and 2015, the airport completed $1.5 billion worth of construction projects, part of which later became known as the &quot;CLT 2015&quot; plan. These projects included a new airport entrance roadway, new hourly parking decks with a centralized rental car facility, a regional intermodal cargo facility, an expansion of the east-side terminal lobby, new checked baggage handling systems, and additional space for concessions and shops.

Construction of the airport&#x27;s fourth runway began in spring 2007. At long, the new &quot;third parallel&quot; allows three independent approaches for arrivals even from the south, potentially increasing capacity by 33 percent. The new runway lies west of the three existing runways. The construction of the fourth runway required the relocation of parts of Wallace Neel Road (which had been the Western boundary of the airport) to an alignment located farther to the west. Construction occurred in two phases. The first phase, which began in March 2007, included grading and drainage. The second phase included the paving and lighting of the runway. In August 2009, crews paved the last section.

With the merger of US Airways and American Airlines in 2013, Charlotte became the second-largest hub for the merged airline, after Dallas/Fort Worth.

=== 2013–present: post-merger growth and Destination CLT ===

In 2015, airport officials formally announced the completion of the &quot;CLT 2015&quot; plan, and kicked off construction of the new Destination CLT airport development plan. Destination CLT represents a total $2.5 billion investment into the future growth of the airport.

Concourse A North, a nine-gate expansion of Concourse A, was completed in summer 2018. Air Canada, JetBlue, United, Southwest, Frontier, and Spirit moved their operations to Concourse A North upon its completion. A digital artwork titled &quot;Interconnected,&quot; by Refik Anadol, is prominently featured on three massive display screens in Concourse A North. The artwork draws from the airport&#x27;s data network of aircraft movements and turns the data into an always-changing visual artwork. The main -long screen is one of the largest digital artworks of its kind in the world.

In late 2019, the new terminal roadway was opened. The new roadway has sixteen lanes over two levels, with departures traffic using the elevated level and arrivals traffic utilizing the ground level. The eight lanes on each level are split into five outer lanes for personal vehicles, and three inner lanes for commercial and airport vehicles. Some components of the project, namely the skybridges from the hourly parking deck and rental car facility, the glass canopy over the roadway, and some lanes on the departure level will not be finished until the terminal lobby project is complete.

In November 2019, the East Terminal Expansion opened. The expansion added , primarily of passenger amenity space, across three levels. The main level of the expansion is &quot;The Plaza,&quot; a food court. The Plaza&#x27;s artistic centerpiece is a hanging artwork entitled &quot;Loops&quot; by Christian Moeller. &quot;Loops&quot; became a part of the project through a partnership between the airport and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Arts and Science Council. The upper level of the East Terminal Expansion includes a Centurion Lounge.

The airport announced that it had served 50.2 million passengers in 2019, a new record for the airport.

Destination CLT includes a $90 million terminal renovation project of Concourses A, B, C, D, and the Atrium. Aspects of the renovations include the replacement of carpet with terrazzo, upgraded lighting, remodeled bathrooms, and new seats with charging in every seat. Concourse B renovations wrapped up in 2019.

With the conclusion of the terminal roadway and curb front construction, work on the terminal lobby renovation and expansion began. The $600 million project is projected to be completed in 2025. The project will consolidate existing security checkpoints A, B, C, D, and E into three larger and more efficient checkpoints. The baggage claim and ticketing areas will be completely gutted and remodeled. Raymond Kaskey&#x27;s &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot; statue will be moved to a prominent position within the new &quot;Queen&#x27;s Court&quot; area in the expanded lobby. After the lobby renovation and expansion is complete, a glass canopy will be constructed over the roadway and pedestrian skybridges and tunnels will be built connecting the terminal to the hourly parking/rental car facility complex.

Separate from the Destination CLT family of projects, the FAA is building a new control tower south of the CLT passenger terminal to replace the existing tower north of the terminal. When complete, the tower will be the second-tallest air traffic control tower in the United States and the ninth-tallest in the world. The new tower is now functioning and in use.

===Future===
Planning is currently underway for the construction of a fourth parallel runway between existing runways 18R/36L and 18C/36C. The runway, projected to cost $1 billion, is slated to be long. It broke ground in June 2023 and construction will complete in 2027. Previously, a 12,000-foot runway had been planned; however, the airport reversed course due to practicality and cost considerations.

Future terminal expansions included under the Destination CLT umbrella include Phase II of the Concourse A Expansion, Phase VIII of the Concourse E expansion, and expansions to Concourses B and C. These expansions are projected to cost roughly $1.1 billion and are not expected to be complete until 2026. 8-10 gates are expected to be added to Concourse B, 10-12 gates to Concourse C, and 10 gates in the expansion of Concourse A farther north. Phase VIII of the Concourse E expansion will add of hold room to the concourse. This phase of the expansion accommodates gates already in operation; however, passengers must walk under temporary canopies to access the aircraft parked at these gates.

The construction of the CATS LYNX Silver Line, expected to be complete in 2030, will bring light rail service to the airport. The airport plans to construct an automated people mover to connect the terminal to the light rail station, which will be located at the airport&#x27;s Destination District just north of the terminal.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
CLT has one terminal with 124 gates on five concourses. All five concourses are connected to the central terminal building housing ticketing, security, and baggage claim.

*Concourse A has 32 gates. The main pier serves American while the two Concourse A North extension piers serve United, Southwest, jetBlue, Spirit, Delta, Frontier, Sun Country, and Air Canada.
*Concourse B has 16 gates and serves exclusively American mainline domestic flights.
*Concourse C has 18 gates and serves exclusively American mainline domestic flights.
*Concourse D has 13 gates and serves American, Lufthansa, and Volaris. All international flights without customs preclearance are processed at Concourse D. 
*Concourse E has 45 gates. Concourse E is the home of American Eagle&#x27;s CLT operation, which is the largest express flight operation in the world. In Spring of 2023, Contour, who has an interline agreement with American, moved its Essential Air Service flights into the E1-E3 gates in the concourse.

American has two Admirals Club locations in Concourses B &amp; C. An American Express Centurion Lounge is located in the Plaza between Concourse D &amp; E. The Club CLT Lounge is located on the walkway to the A North Concourse. It is accessible to Priority Pass and Lounge Key passholders as well as individuals purchasing a day pass. A new 15,000 square-foot Delta Skyclub is slated to open in December 2024 in the new A Concourse.

===Runways===
CLT currently has three runways.

===Ground transportation===
The airport terminal is located on Josh Birmingham Parkway, which connects with Wilkinson Boulevard (to I-485 and Uptown Charlotte), Little Rock Road (to I-85) and Billy Graham Parkway (to I-77).

The Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) operates two bus routes from the airport terminal: Route 5-Airport (Sprinter) to Uptown Charlotte/CTC and Route 60-Tyvola Road to LYNX Tyvola station. There is also bus service to the air cargo center, maintenance facilities, and old terminal via Route 10-West Boulevard to the Charlotte Transportation Center in center city Charlotte. The proposed Lynx Silver Line would serve the airport, traveling along a route that largely follows the Sprinter route.

Located in front of the airport terminal, the Rental Car Facility operates on the three lower levels of the Hourly Deck and has a combined 3,000 cars from eight rental car companies. The level 2 lobby includes customer counters and kiosks from the following companies: Advantage, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz and National.

===Other facilities===
Charlotte Douglas International Airport is one of a small number of major &quot;hub&quot; airports in the world that has an aviation museum located on the field. Sullenberger Aviation Museum, established in 1992, has a collection of over 50 aircraft, including a DC-3 that is painted in Piedmont Airlines livery. The museum also has an aviation library with over 9,000 volumes and a very extensive photography collection. Rare aircraft in the collection include one of only two surviving Douglas D-558 Skystreak aircraft and the second (and oldest surviving) U.S.-built Harrier, which was used as the flight-test aircraft and accumulated over 5,000 flight-test hours. In January 2011, the museum acquired N106US, the US Airways Airbus A320 ditched by captain Chesley Sullenberger as US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009. This aircraft, which was delivered on June 10, 2011, is about 35 years younger than any other commercial airliner on display in a museum.

Charlotte Douglas International Airport is one of the few airports in the United States with a public viewing area. Here, visitors can watch planes take off, land, and taxi to and from runway 18C/36C in addition to providing a view of concourse A. The Overlook is a popular spot for aviation enthusiasts and plane spotters. Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a smoke-free facility, which means that smoking is prohibited inside the terminal building, including all restaurants, bars, lounges, and airline clubs. This is in accordance with the North Carolina Smoke-Free Law, which bans smoking in most of the public places and workplaces. However, this does not mean that smokers have no options at CLT. The Charlotte airport smoking area is easily accessible from inside and outside the terminal using the elevators or stairs near Door 1A or Door 1B.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On May 24, 1950, a Grumman Mallard operated by Ford Motor Company crashed during takeoff. One occupant was killed.
*On September 11, 1974, Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 crashed on final approach en route from Charleston, South Carolina. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was a &quot;lack of altitude awareness&quot; of the pilots at critical points during the approach. Of 82 people on board, only 13 survived the crash and fire; three of those died within a month of the accident.
*On October 25, 1986, Piedmont Airlines Flight 467 overran the runway, damaging the airplane beyond repair. Of the 119 people on board, three passengers sustained serious injuries, and three crew members and 28 passengers sustained minor injuries in the incident. There were no fatalities. An NTSB report was released, which concluded that &quot;crew coordination was deficient due to the first officer&#x27;s failure to call the captain&#x27;s attention to aspects of the approach that were not in accordance with Piedmont operating procedures.&quot;
*On January 19, 1988, a Mountain Air Cargo De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 200 (N996SA), on a flight from Erie, Pennsylvania, collided with a tree when attempting to approach the 36L runway. One crew member was seriously injured.
*On July 2, 1994, USAir Flight 1016, which originated in Columbia, South Carolina, crashed in a residential area on approach, killing 37. The crash of the DC-9 was attributed to windshear during a thunderstorm.
*On December 10, 1997, a Beechcraft King Air, operated by Spitfire Sales and Leasing crashed on approach to runway 36L colliding with trees and the ground. One crewmember was killed.
*On January 8, 2003, US Airways Express Flight 5481 crashed on takeoff while en route to Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, killing all 21 people aboard. The flight was operated by Air Midwest, an independent airline operating under a US Airways Express codesharing agreement. The cause of the accident was due to the center of gravity (CG) calculations used a reference from 1936 and didn&#x27;t take into account that people in general had become bigger over time. This resulted in the 23 checked bags - two of which were exceptionally heavy- moving the CG 5% further aft than allowed. Additionally, maintenance to the elevator cables 3 days before, during routine check by a 3rd party contractor, were done incorrectly by a mechanic in training who had NEVER worked on this type of aircraft before and was talked through it by the instructing maintenance supervisor - who was also the quality assurance inspector. He left out several critical steps when talking the mechanic trainee through the process. This limited the pitch down on the aircraft and prevented the cockpit crew from correcting the CG problem. Since the plane had already had 8 previous cycles after the scheduled maintenance, it was determined that just the CG miscalculation OR the improper setting of the elevator cable would not have caused the crash. Only the two issues together caused the crash.
*On February 15th, 2017, a CRJ-700, operated by American Eagle, struck a deer while taking off. The aircraft declared an emergency and returned to Charlotte due to a fuel leak. None of the 44 passengers or crew were injured.
*On August 13th, 2019, a Piedmont Airlines ramp agent was killed after a baggage tug flipped on top of him. Piedmont was fined $20,000 by OSHA as result.
*On June 28, 2023, a Delta Air Lines Boeing 717 from Atlanta landed at CLT without its nose gear deployed on runway 36L. None of the 101 passengers and crew on board were injured.

<doc id="264294" wikidata="Q1111160" url="?curid=264294" title="Faith (The Cure album)">
<text>Faith is the third studio album by English rock band the Cure, released on 17 April 1981 by Fiction Records. The album saw the band continuing in the gloomy vein of their previous effort &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; (1980). This stylistic theme would conclude with their next album &quot;Pornography&quot; (1982).

Preceded by the single &quot;Primary&quot;, the album was well-received by critics and was a commercial success in the UK, peaking at number fourteen on the UK Albums Chart and staying on the chart for eight weeks.

== Background ==
Following the tour for &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot;, the Cure returned to Morgan Studios on 27 September 1980 to record a new album, minus Matthieu Hartley, who had departed due to disagreement with the musical direction of the band. During this session, recordings of songs &quot;All Cats Are Grey&quot; and &quot;Primary&quot; were attempted, but neither ended up on the album. Robert Smith was hoping the tracks would sound &quot;funereal&quot;, but instead he said &quot;they just sounded dull&quot;. Several other studios were tried: Red Bus, Trident, The Roundhouse and Abbey Road.

Much of &quot;Faith&quot; was written in the studio. Tolhurst says: &quot;We had been on the road constantly, switching between recording an album and touring.&quot; At least two songs on the album, &quot;All Cats Are Grey&quot; and &quot;The Drowning Man&quot;, were inspired by the &quot;Gormenghast&quot; novels of Mervyn Peake. &quot;Faith&quot; was the first album by the Cure to feature a six-string bass guitar; &quot;All Cats Are Grey&quot; (for which drummer Laurence Tolhurst has claimed a rare lyric-writing credit) features Smith on keyboards and piano, with no guitar at all.

The instrumental piece &quot;Carnage Visors&quot; (i.e., an antonym for &quot;rose-coloured spectacles&quot;; originally available only on the long-play cassette release) is the soundtrack to &quot;Carnage Visors&quot;, a short film by Ric Gallup, Simon Gallup&#x27;s brother, that was screened at the beginning of shows in place of a support band on the 1981 Picture Tour, and featured animation of several dolls in different positions and stances. The film has since disappeared, and only Smith, Lol Tolhurst and Simon Gallup own copies of it, though during a televised interview in the mid-1980s, the host of the program surprised the band by playing a clip of the film on set.

The album&#x27;s cover, designed by former and future member Porl Thompson, is a veiled picture of the church Bolton Priory, in the fog.

== Release and re-issues==
&quot;Faith&quot; was released on 17 April 1981. It reached No. 14 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was remastered in 2005 as part of Universal Music&#x27;s Deluxe Edition series. The new edition featured &quot;Carnage Visors&quot;, demos and live tracks as well as the non-album single &quot;Charlotte Sometimes&quot;. It also included a few never-before-released tracks (in demo form, all instrumentals). In 2021, a 40th anniversary vinyl picture disc was released for Record Store Day.

== Critical reception and legacy ==
&quot;Faith&quot; divided critics upon release. &quot;Sounds&quot; reviewer John Gill wrote that while the more uptempo songs &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Doubt&quot; were reminiscent of the Cure&#x27;s previous work, with a &quot;sense of strong, haunting melody&quot;, the remainder of the album marked a stark departure for the band; he noted a &quot;Neu!-ish sense of smudged melody, soft tones flowing around a languorous, groaning bass&quot;, and found that the band&#x27;s new sound evoked 1960s acts such as Pink Floyd and the Doors. Gill remarked that &quot;listening to &quot;Faith&quot; requires a personal act of involvement, the reward being a sense of belonging.&quot;

&quot;Melody Maker&quot; deemed the record &quot;impressive&quot;, praising its &quot;richness and deceptive power&quot;. Writer Adam Sweeting described &quot;Faith&quot; as &quot;a sophisticated exercise in atmosphere and production&quot;, adding, &quot;It&#x27;s gloomy but frequently majestic, never using brute force where auto-suggestion will do. You may not love it, but you&#x27;ll become addicted to it.&quot; David Hepworth of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; said that &quot;despite some rather stilted lyrics&quot;, the Cure &quot;continue to develop one of the most individual and pleasing styles around.&quot; &quot;NME&quot;″s review of the album, written by Ray Lowry, was accompanied by a picture of the band and a caption reading: &quot;Gloomy? Gothic? Us?&quot;. Lowry wrote that the album &quot;says absolutely nothing meaningful&quot; and dismissed it as &quot;just the modern face of Pink Floydism.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot;″s Mike Nicholls found that &quot;The Cure remain stuck in the hackneyed doom-mongering that should have died with Joy Division&quot; and panned &quot;Faith&quot; as &quot;hollow, shallow, pretentious, meaningless, self-important and bereft of any real heart or soul&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Chris True of AllMusic called &quot;Faith&quot; &quot;a depressing record, certainly, but also one of the most underrated and beautiful albums the Cure put together.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Fact&quot; ranked the album as one of the 20 best &quot;goth records ever made&quot;.

<text>David Jay (born April 24, 1982) is an American asexual activist. Jay is the founder and webmaster of the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN), the most prolific and well-known of the various asexual communities established since the advent of the World Wide Web and social media.

==Activism==
Frustrated with the lack of resources available regarding asexuality, Jay launched AVEN&#x27;s website in 2001. Since then, he has taken a leading role in the asexuality movement, appearing on multiple television shows, and being featured heavily in Arts Engine&#x27;s 2011 documentary &quot;(A)sexual&quot;.

AVEN, which Salon.com referred to as the &quot;unofficial online headquarters&quot; of the asexuality movement, is widely recognised as the largest online asexual community. Its two main goals are to create public acceptance and discussion about asexuality and to facilitate the growth of a large online asexual community. As of June 17, 2013, AVEN has nearly 70,000 registered members.

In New York City, working both with the Department of Education and private organizations, he has been providing training on Ace (asexual) inclusion to health educators.

==Personal life==
Jay is from St. Louis, Missouri, and he graduated from Crossroads College Preparatory School in 2000. At the age of 15, Jay began considering himself asexual, and he came out as asexual while a student at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.

Jay is part of a nonromantic, three-parent family, which he views as influenced by his asexual identity.

== Writing ==
In 2024, David Jay published a book on relationships titled &quot;Relationality: How Moving From Transactional to Transformational Relationships can Reshape Our Lonely World.&quot;

<doc id="264296" wikidata="Q932429" url="?curid=264296" title="Porno for Pyros">
<text>Porno for Pyros was an American alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1992, following the first break-up of Jane&#x27;s Addiction. The band currently consists of Jane&#x27;s Addiction members, Perry Farrell (vocals) and Stephen Perkins (drums), alongside Peter DiStefano (guitar) and Mike Watt (bass). Founding bass guitarist Martyn LeNoble was a member of the band between 1992 and 1995, and was initially committed to the band&#x27;s reunion between 2022 and 2023.

The band released two studio albums, &quot;Porno for Pyros&quot; (1993) and &quot;Good God&#x27;s Urge&quot; (1996), before going on hiatus in 1998. In 2009, the original line-up reunited for a one-off appearance at frontman Perry Farrell&#x27;s 50th birthday party. In 2020, the Watt-era line-up of the band reunited for Lolla2020, a free YouTube broadcast event taking place amidst global COVID-19 lockdowns. Following the appearance, members of the group continued to work on new material together, and in 2022, Farrell and Perkins reunited Porno for Pyros for their first large-scale public performances in more than 24 years, leading to a full reunion of the band&#x27;s original line-up at Welcome to Rockville festival.

The original four-piece recorded new material in 2023, with plans to release a four-track EP in 2024. After a full reunion tour was rescheduled to 2024, LeNoble amicably left the band in November 2023, with the band subsequently announcing that their forthcoming tour would be a farewell tour.

==History==
===1992–1994: Formation and &quot;Porno for Pyros&quot;===
Following the demise of the critically and commercially successful Jane&#x27;s Addiction, frontman Perry Farrell and drummer Stephen Perkins formed Porno for Pyros after acquiring guitarist Peter DiStefano and bass player Martyn LeNoble. Farrell named the band after seeing an ad for fireworks in a pornographic magazine. The name has also been connected through song lyrics to the 1992 Los Angeles riots which occurred in the band&#x27;s hometown around the time of Porno for Pyros&#x27; inception. Prior to releasing their eponymous first album, Porno for Pyros embarked on a nationwide tour to support the new band. By the time the band&#x27;s debut album was released in 1993, anticipation surrounding the project was enough to briefly drive the album to the No. 3 position on the Billboard top 200 list. The video for the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Pets&quot;, received heavy airplay on MTV. Following the album&#x27;s release, Porno for Pyros continued a heavy touring schedule, including an appearance at Woodstock &#x27;94 along with a cameo on HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. Unlike the relatively straight-ahead rock shows that were the hallmark of live Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Porno for Pyros live shows relied heavily on props, extras and special effects (including pyrotechnics).

===1995–1998: &quot;Good God&#x27;s Urge&quot; and break-up===
For the band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Good God&#x27;s Urge&quot;, bass player LeNoble quit after completing the majority of the bass tracks. Ex-Minutemen bassist Mike Watt was brought in to finish up the album tracks and join the band on tour. The album also featured the post-Jane&#x27;s reunion of Farrell with guitarist Dave Navarro, who made a guest appearance on &quot;Freeway&quot;, along with Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; bass player Flea. The band again set forth on a heavy touring schedule with Watt on bass, then with Flea on bass with Perkins and Farrell&#x27;s former Jane&#x27;s Addiction bandmate Dave Navarro on guitar. In reality, the end of Porno For Pyros bled into the &quot;relapsed Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; situation, as Jane&#x27;s guitarist Dave Navarro and his Red Hot Chili Pepper bandmate Flea guested on 2 songs from the Good God&#x27;s Urge sessions, &quot;Freeway&quot; and &quot;Hard Charger.&quot; As &quot;Hard Charger&quot; was released and charted as a single from the Howard Stern Private Parts movie, the final touring dates for Porno For Pyros featured 3/4 of Jane&#x27;s Addiction Dave Navarro and Flea onstage with Peter DeStefano and touring members Sunny Reinhart and Thomas &quot;TJ&quot; Johnson. On several tour stops Porno for Pyros played &quot;Mountain Song&quot;, a popular Jane&#x27;s Addiction tune, a foreshadowing of the later Jane&#x27;s Addiction reunion efforts. Further touring by the band was scuttled when DiStefano was diagnosed with cancer.

Perkins and Watt subsequently formed the jazz-punk improvisation group Banyan and, along with DiStefano, occasionally perform sets of Stooges cover versions in the Los Angeles area under the band name Hellride.

===2009–2019: One-off reunion and rumours===
In April 2009, the original lineup of Farrell, Perkins, DiStefano, and LeNoble performed at Farrell&#x27;s 50th birthday party. In April 2011, Farrell wrote on his Twitter account: &quot;One day, more Porno For Pyros&quot;, suggesting that the band would reunite in the future. On September 3, 2012, DiStefano stated that the band would be active in 2013, which was later also announced by Farrell on his Facebook page on July 6, 2013. In 2018, the band were rumoured to be part of an immersive entertainment experience in Las Vegas, named Kind Heaven, created by Farrell, which never came to fruition.

===2020–2024: Full reunion and farewell tour===
On July 27, 2020, it was announced that for the first time in 22 years, Porno for Pyros (featuring the lineup of Perry Farrell, Stephen Perkins, Mike Watt and Peter DiStefano) would be reuniting to play Lolla2020, a free four-night YouTube broadcast event taking place on the original dates of the 2020 Chicago-based Lollapalooza festival, Thursday, July 30 through Sunday, August 2.

On July 20, 2021, DiStefano announced on his Facebook page that he, Farrell and Perkins were working on what will be new material from Porno for Pyros in over two decades.

On May 18, 2022, Farrell shared Jane’s Addiction will not be playing Welcome to Rockville concert in Daytona Beach, Florida, on May 22 due to guitarist Dave Navarro suffering from a “long bout” of COVID-19, but is reuniting his band Porno for Pyros for the performance. “The gang and the government are no different. That makes me 1%. Rockville, although we are blue that Jane’s cannot be with you at this time due to Dave’s long bout with COVID, I am still coming to Daytona, bringing to you for the first time in 26 years Porno For Pyros Featuring myself, Perry Farrell, Stephen Perkins, Peter DiStefeno and Mike Watt. We’ll play some Jane’s songs for you as well, but for now let’s recall: My boat’s capsized it’s gonna sink to the bottom. I can see the lights on the shore…” noted Farrell on the Welcome to Rockville Facebook page. Drummer Stephen Perkins was replaced by his drum tech Mike Gryciuk for the performance due to a stomach virus, with Nick Maybury, formerly of Scott Weiland &amp; the Wildabouts on additional guitar.

For the band&#x27;s subsequent summer shows and appearance at Lollapalooza, founding bassist Martyn LeNoble rejoined the band, with the original four-piece working on new material the following year. The band will release a four-track EP of original material in 2024.

After the band&#x27;s initial reunion tour was postponed and rescheduled, LeNoble announced his amicable departure from the band on November 13, 2023: &quot;I’m so excited for the world to hear &quot;Agua&quot; and the other unreleased material from our recent sessions. There is a real connection between these new songs and how we&#x27;ve grown. We&#x27;ve mended our friendships and recorded these songs with love. I think you will hear that in the recordings. I&#x27;ve changed. I like quiet and nature. With that being said, I will be following my passion for wildlife and will not be part of the upcoming tour. I wish my brothers Perry, Pete and Stephen the best. I&#x27;m truly grateful for every moment I spent with them. Most importantly, thank you to all of you for all of the amazing support and memories.&quot;

Following LeNoble&#x27;s departure, the band announced that their 2024 tour would now be a farewell tour, titled the &quot;Horns, Thorns en Halos&quot;, with Mike Watt rejoining the band on bass guitar for its final shows.

<doc id="264301" wikidata="Q6396458" url="?curid=264301" title="Kevin Haskins">
<text>Kevin Michael Dompe (born 19 July 1960), born and best-known as Kevin Michael Haskins, is an English drummer, best known from the British rock group Bauhaus. He was also a member of Tones on Tail and Love and Rockets.

==Early career==
As a child, Haskins banged on flowerpots and kitchen pots and pans. He eventually moved to bongos and then to drums. It wasn&#x27;t until Haskins attended a Sex Pistols gig that he and his brother David J formed a band called the Submerged Tenth. The band was short-lived, but Haskins and J collaborated again in another band which featured guitarist Daniel Ash.

==Influences==
The beginnings of the post-punk scene had a strong effect on Haskins. He cited as drummers who &quot;had an influence on me namely, Stephen Morris from Joy Division and Kenny Morris from Siouxsie and the Banshees. I liked how Stephen played sixteenth notes on the hi hat and he used this wonderful electronic drum called The Synare drum which I ran out and bought immediately! With Kenny I loved how he would use the tom tom drums rather than hi hats and cymbals.&quot;

==Bauhaus==

In 1978, Haskins, David J, Ash, and vocalist Peter Murphy, formed Bauhaus 1919. The name is reference to the German Bauhaus art movement of the 1920s, because of its &quot;stylistic implications and associations&quot;, according to David J. The band also chose to use the same typeface used on the Bauhaus college building in Dessau, Germany. Although there were bands before them that pre-figured the style, Bauhaus is generally agreed to have been the first gothic rock group.

Bauhaus combined a number of influences (punk, glam rock, even funk and dub) to create a gloomy, but passionate sound which appealed to many looking for something new in the wake of punk&#x27;s collapse. Their sound proved inspiring and brought attention to a whole wave of post-punk groups delving in the gloomy style that would eventually come to be known as gothic rock. Bauhaus became one of the most influential goth rock bands. Bauhaus officially broke up (for the first time) in July 1983.

In 1998, Haskins reunited with Bauhaus for the popular &quot;Resurrection&quot; tour. The band reformed again in 2005 to co-headline the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival held in Indio, California, which was followed by another tour through North America, Mexico, and Europe. In the summer of 2006 Bauhaus toured with Nine Inch Nails on the summer leg of the With Teeth tour.

==Tones on Tail / Love and Rockets==
When Daniel Ash pursued his first side project Tones on Tail with bassist Glenn Campling, he asked Haskins to play drums. He again utilized Kevin for his next band Love and Rockets which also featured David J. Despite their previous band&#x27;s goth status, Love and Rockets moved away from that genre. Their first release, &quot;Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven&quot; (1985), leaned more towards psychedelic music. In 1987, &quot;Earth, Sun, Moon&quot; had a folkier sound and spawned the minor hit &quot;No New Tale to Tell&quot;.

In 1989, Love and Rockets released &quot;So Alive&quot;, a top ten hit. After a grueling tour schedule in support of their big hit Love and Rockets took five years off before returning to the studio together. The result was a move to a much more electronic sound that had more in common with the Orb than their rock or Goth roots. A few more records were released including &quot;Sweet F.A.&quot; and &quot;Lift&quot;, but interest in the group increasingly dwindled and the band&#x27;s members went in different directions in 1998. It was then when Kevin decided to make music from his home so he could spend more time with his wife and two daughters.

==Messy Music==
In the autumn of 1998, Haskins began composing scores for video games, film and television, under the name Messy Music, with partner Doug DeAngelis. The duo met as producer and artist during the making of the Love and Rockets album &quot;Lift&quot;. 

DeAngelis and Haskins describe Messy as electronic alternative music, featuring guests like Michael Balzary from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jessicka from Scarling., among others. Messy&#x27;s credits include music for &quot;Myst III&quot;, &quot;The Crow: Salvation&quot;, &quot;Saw II&quot;, 2Gether, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Third Watch&quot;, &quot;Things Behind the Sun&quot;, and trailers for Skechers, PlayStation 2, and IFC.

==Personal life==
He lives in Los Angeles, California, with his wife Pamela Dompe, and two daughters, Diva Lynn and Lola Rose. Haskins&#x27; wife and daughters were all born in England. 

Both daughters played in the band Blackblack. Additionally, Haskins and his daughter Diva are in the band Poptone, with Daniel Ash. Lola Dompe is currently a drummer and vocalist in the band Automatic.

<text>Alexa Internet, Inc. was a web traffic analysis company based in San Francisco, California. It was founded as an independent company by Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat in 1996. Alexa provided web traffic data, global rankings, and other information on over 30 million websites. It was acquired by Amazon in 1999 for $250 million in stock. Amazon discontinued the Alexa Internet service on May 1, 2022.

Alexa estimated website traffic based on a sample of millions of Internet users using browser extensions as well as from sites that had chosen to install an Alexa script. As of 2020, its website was visited by over 400 million people every month.

== Operations and history ==

=== 1996–1999 ===
Alexa Internet was founded in April 1996 by Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat. The company&#x27;s name was chosen in homage to the Library of Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt, drawing a parallel between the largest repository of knowledge in the ancient world and the potential of the Internet to become a similar store of knowledge. Alexa initially offered a toolbar that gave Internet users suggestions on where to go next based on the traffic patterns of its user community. The company also offered context for each site visited: to whom it was registered, how many pages it had, how many other sites pointed to it, and how frequently it was updated.

Alexa&#x27;s operations grew to include the archiving of web pages as they are &quot;crawled&quot; and examined by an automated computer program (nicknamed a &quot;bot&quot; or &quot;web crawler&quot;). This database served as the basis for the creation of the Internet Archive, accessible through the Wayback Machine. In 1998, the company donated a copy of the archive, two terabytes in size, to the Library of Congress. Alexa continued to supply the Internet Archive with web crawls. In 1999, as the company moved away from its original vision of providing an &quot;intelligent&quot; search engine, Alexa was acquired by Amazon.com for approximately US$250 million in Amazon stock.

=== 2000–2009 ===
Alexa began a partnership with Google in early 2002 and with the web directory DMOZ in January 2003. In December 2005, Alexa opened its extensive search index and Web-crawling facilities to third-party programs through a comprehensive set of Web services and APIs. These could be used, for instance, to construct vertical search engines that could run on Alexa&#x27;s servers or elsewhere. In May 2006, Google was replaced by Windows Live Search as a provider of search results. In December 2006, Amazon released Alexa Image Search. Built in-house, it was the first major application built on the company&#x27;s Web platform. In May 2007, Alexa changed their API to limit comparisons to three websites, reduce the size of embedded graphs in Flash, and add mandatory embedded BritePic advertisements.

In April 2007, the company filed a lawsuit, &quot;Alexa v. Hornbaker,&quot; to stop trademark infringement by the Statsaholic service. In the lawsuit, Alexa alleged that Ron Hornbaker was stealing traffic graphs for profit and that the primary purpose of his site was to display graphs that were generated by Alexa&#x27;s servers. Hornbaker had removed the term &quot;Alexa&quot; from his service name on March 19, 2007. On November 27, 2008, Amazon announced that Alexa Web Search was no longer accepting new customers and that the service would be deprecated or discontinued for existing customers on January 26, 2009. Thereafter, Alexa became a purely analytics-focused company.

On March 31, 2009, Alexa revealed a major website redesign. The redesigned site provided new web traffic metrics, including average page views per individual user, bounce rate (the rate of users who come to and then leave a webpage), and user time on the website. In the following weeks, Alexa added more features, including visitor demographics, clickstream, and web search traffic statistics.

=== 2010–2020 ===
During this period, Alexa&#x27;s algorithm had been evolving along with it. Statistics projection and the use of their technology associated with a large network of certificated websites allowed them to keep ahead of the website traffic metrics around the world. Because of this, many large sites were using it as the main reference for popularity on the internet.

On November 6, 2014, Amazon announced Amazon Alexa, their virtual assistant. Amazon already had trademarks for &quot;Alexa&quot; due to their ownership of Alexa Internet, Inc.

=== End of service ===
On December 8, 2021, Amazon announced the cessation of its website ranking and competitive analysis service, which has been available to the public for more than 25 years. From that day on, it was no longer possible to create accounts or buy subscriptions on the service. The statement first published on its website specifies the total cessation of the service as of May 1, 2022. Existing subscriptions would be available until May 1, 2022, UTC, after which everything on the site would be removed and replaced with an &quot;End of Service Notice&quot;.

The alexa.com domain is now a landing page for Amazon Alexa products.

== Alexa Traffic Rank ==
A key metric published from Alexa Internet analytics was the Alexa Traffic Rank, also simply known as Alexa Rank. It was also referred to as &quot;Global Rank&quot; by Alexa Internet and was designed to be an estimate of a website&#x27;s popularity. , Alexa Internet&#x27;s tooltip for Global Rank said the rank is calculated from a combination of daily visitors and page views on a website over a three-month period.

The Alexa Traffic Rank could be used to monitor the popularity trend of a website and compare the popularity of different websites.

The traffic rank used to be determined from data recollected from users that had the Alexa toolbar installed on their browser. As of 2020, Alexa did not use a toolbar; instead, it used data from users that had installed any of a number of browser extensions and from websites that had the Alexa script installed on their webpages.

== Tracking ==

=== Browser extensions ===
Alexa replaced their toolbar with browser extensions. These extensions were made available for Google Chrome and Firefox browsers. The Alexa browser extension displayed the Alexa Traffic Rank for websites, showed related websites, provided search analytics, and quickly allowed users to view the Internet Archive through the Wayback Machine. They were last updated in May 2020, two years prior to the service&#x27;s closure.

==== Toolbar ====
Alexa used to rank sites based primarily on tracking a sample set of Internet traffic—users of its browser toolbar for the Internet Explorer, Firefox and Google Chrome web browsers. The Alexa Toolbar included a popup blocker (which stops unwanted ads), a search box, links to Amazon.com and the Alexa homepage, and the Alexa ranking of the website that the user is visiting. It also allowed the user to rate the website and view links to external, relevant websites. In early 2005, Alexa stated that there had been 10 million downloads of the toolbar, though the company did not provide statistics about active usage. Originally, web pages were only ranked amongst users who had the Alexa Toolbar installed, and could be biased if a specific audience subgroup was reluctant to take part in the rankings. This caused some controversies over how representative Alexa&#x27;s user base was of typical Internet behavior, especially for less-visited sites. In 2007, Michael Arrington provided examples of Alexa rankings known to contradict data from the comScore web analytics service, including ranking YouTube ahead of Google. In 2021 John Mueller from Google confirmed again that Google does not use Amazon Alexa Rank.

=====Search Status=====
Until 2007, a third-party-supplied Mozilla plug-in called Search Status for the Firefox browser served as the only option for Firefox users after Amazon abandoned its A9 toolbar. On July 16, 2007, Alexa released an official toolbar for Firefox called Sparky. On 16 April 2008, many users reported drastic shifts in their Alexa rankings. Alexa confirmed this later in the day with an announcement that they had released an updated ranking system, claiming that they would now take into account more sources of data &quot;beyond Alexa Toolbar users&quot;.

=== Certified statistics ===
Using the Alexa Pro service, website owners could sign up for &quot;certified statistics&quot;, which allowed Alexa more access to a website&#x27;s traffic data. Site owners input JavaScript code on each page of their website that, if permitted by the user&#x27;s security and privacy settings, ran and sent traffic data to Alexa, allowing Alexa to display—or not display, depending on the owner&#x27;s preference—more accurate statistics such as total page views and unique page views.

<doc id="264305" wikidata="Q951372" url="?curid=264305" title="Monoenergism">
<text>Monoenergism () was a notion in early medieval Christian theology, representing the belief that Christ had only one &quot;energy&quot; (&quot;energeia&quot;). The teaching of one energy was propagated during the first half of the seventh century by Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople. Opposition to dyoenergism, its counterpart, would persist until Dyoenergism was espoused as Orthodoxy at the Sixth Ecumenical Council and monoenergism was rejected as heresy.

==History==
After the failure of Emperor Justinian I and the Second Council of Constantinople to mend the Chalcedonian schism and unify main Christian communities within the Byzantine Empire by a single Christology, similar efforts were renewed by Heraclius (610–641), who attempted to solve the schism between the Chalcedonian (also called dyophysite) party and the non-Chalcedonian miaphysite party, suggesting the compromise of monoenergism. 

This compromise adopted the Chalcedonian dyophysite belief that Christ the Incarnate Logos of God is of and in two natures, but tried to address non-Chalcedonian miaphysite misgivings by the view that Christ had one &quot;energy&quot; (&quot;energeia&quot;), a term whose definition was left deliberately vague. Monoenergism was accepted by the Patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria, as well as by the Armenians and was not clearly criticized by Pope Honorius I of Rome in his 635 epistle. However, it was rejected by Athanasius I Gammolo and the strong opposition of Patriarch Sophronius of Jerusalem won wide support. This led Heraclius to abandon the teaching in 638 (though still condemning dyoenergism) and to attempt to enforce instead the doctrine of monothelitism, opposed most notably by Maximus the Confessor. This too failed to heal the schism and theologically unite the empire.

Both monoenergism as well as monotheletism were condemned as heresies by the Sixth Ecumenical Council, held in Constantinople in 680–681.

<doc id="264310" wikidata="Q1139053" url="?curid=264310" title="Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve">
<text>Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve is a U.S. national monument and national preserve in the Snake River Plain in central Idaho. It is along US 20 (concurrent with US 93 and US 26), between the small towns of Arco and Carey, at an average elevation of above sea level.

The Monument was established on May 2, 1924. In November 2000, a presidential proclamation by President Clinton greatly expanded the Monument area. The 410,000-acre National Park Service portions of the expanded Monument were designated as Craters of the Moon National Preserve in August 2002. It spreads across Blaine, Butte, Lincoln, Minidoka, and Power counties. The area is managed cooperatively by the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

The Monument and Preserve encompass three major lava fields and about of sagebrush steppe grasslands to cover a total area of . The Monument alone covers . All three lava fields lie along the Great Rift of Idaho, with some of the best examples of open rift cracks in the world, including the deepest known on Earth at . There are excellent examples of almost every variety of basaltic lava, as well as tree molds (cavities left by lava-incinerated trees), lava tubes (a type of cave), and many other volcanic features.

== Geography and geologic setting ==
Craters of the Moon is in south-central Idaho, midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains. Combined U.S. Highway 20–26–93 cuts through the northwestern part of the monument and provides access to it. However, the rugged landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one paved road across the northern end.

The Craters of the Moon Lava Field spreads across and is the largest mostly Holocene-aged basaltic lava field in the contiguous United States. The Monument and Preserve contain more than 25 volcanic cones, including outstanding examples of spatter cones. The 60 distinct solidified lava flows that form the Craters of the Moon Lava Field range in age from 15,000 to just 2,000 years. The Kings Bowl and Wapi lava fields, both about 2,200 years old, are part of the National Preserve.

This lava field is the largest of several large beds of lava that erupted from the south-east to north-west trending Great Rift volcanic zone, a line of weakness in the Earth&#x27;s crust. Together with fields from other fissures they make up the Lava Beds of Idaho, which in turn are in the much larger Snake River Plain volcanic province. The Great Rift extends across almost the entire Snake River Plain.

Elevation at the visitor center is above sea level.

Total average precipitation in the Craters of the Moon area is between per year. Most of this is lost in cracks in the basalt, only to emerge later in springs and seeps in the walls of the Snake River Canyon. Older lava fields on the plain support drought-resistant plants such as sagebrush, while younger fields, such as Craters of the Moon, only have a seasonal and very sparse cover of vegetation. When viewed from a distance, this cover disappears almost entirely, giving an impression of utter black desolation. Repeated lava flows over the last 15,000 years have raised the land surface enough to expose it to the prevailing southwesterly winds, which help to keep the area dry. Together these conditions make life on the lava field difficult.

== History ==
=== Native American history ===
Paleo-Indians visited the area about 12,000 years ago but did not leave much in the way of archaeological evidence. The Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field, during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie west of the lava field. Stone circles visible near Indian Tunnel were built by the indigenous people. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunter-gatherer culture, the Northern Shoshone subsisted off of the land&#x27;s bounty; in addition to gathering edible plants, nuts, roots, and berries, numerous game animals were hunted and trapped, both for meat and supplies, as well as for insulating skins and furs. Larger game hides were used in construction of shelters and windbreaks, while the more delicate furs of smaller mammals were often fashioned into many articles of clothing, used to keep warm; smaller trapped and hunted species included animals such as squirrel, red fox, coyote, river otter, raccoon, pine marten, and rabbit, in addition to numerous bird species. For meat and larger hides, they pursued elk, mule deer, pronghorns, black bears, grizzly bears, bison, cougars, and bighorn sheep – large game, which no longer inhabit the immediate area; these species are still present outside of the park, and in other, further remote reaches of the state. At one time, woodland caribou ranged this far south, likely aiding in sustaining the Shoshone. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the indigenous peoples. Ella E. Clark recorded a Shoshone story that speaks of a serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and squeezed the mountain until liquid rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.

=== Goodale&#x27;s Cutoff ===
Emigrants traveling in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route in the area that used trails left by the indigenous peoples which skirted the jagged lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale&#x27;s Cutoff and part of it is in the northern part of the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of conflict with the Shoshone along the Snake River such as the skirmish that occurred near modern-day Massacre Rocks State Park.

After gold was discovered in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of emigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff. A large wagon train left in July 1862 and met up with more wagons at Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide. Improvements to the cutoff such as adding a ferry to cross the Snake River made it into a popular alternative route of the Oregon Trail.

=== Exploration and early study ===
U.S. Army captain and western explorer B.L.E. Bonneville visited the lava fields and other places in the Western U.S. in the 19th century and wrote about his experiences in his diaries. Washington Irving later used Bonneville&#x27;s diaries to write the &quot;Adventures of Captain Bonneville&quot;, saying this unnamed lava field is a place &quot;where nothing meets the eye but a desolate and awful waste, where no grass grows nor water runs, and where nothing is to be seen but lava.&quot;

In 1879, two Arco cattlemen named Arthur Ferris and J.W. Powell became the first known European-Americans to explore the lava fields. They were investigating its possible use for grazing and watering cattle but found the area to be unsuitable and left.

In 1901 and 1903, Israel Russell became the first geologist to study this area while surveying it for the United States Geological Survey (USGS). In 1910, Samuel Paisley continued Russell&#x27;s work and later would become the monument&#x27;s first custodian. Others followed and in time much of the mystery surrounding this and the other lava beds of Idaho was lifted.

The few European emigrants who visited the area in the 19th century created local legends that it looked like the surface of the Moon. Geologist Harold T. Stearns coined the name &quot;Craters of the Moon&quot; in 1923 while trying to convince the National Park Service to recommend protection of the area in a national monument.

=== Limbert&#x27;s expedition ===
Robert Limbert, a taxidermist, tanner, photographer, filmmaker, and exhibit designer from Boise, first came to the area in 1918 after hearing stories from fur trappers about &quot;strange things they had seen while ranging the region&quot;. In the early 1920s, he explored and mapped the area, which he described as &quot;practically unknown and unexplored...&quot;

Limbert set out on his third and most ambitious foray to the area in May 1920, this time with W.L. Cole and an Airedale terrier to accompany him. Starting from Minidoka, Idaho, they explored what is now the park from south to north, passing Two Point Butte, Echo Crater, Big Craters, North Crater Flow, and out of the lava field through the Yellowstone Park and Lincoln Highway (now known as the Old Arco-Carey Road). Taking the dog along was a mistake, Limbert wrote, &quot;for after three days&#x27; travel his feet were worn and bleeding.&quot; Many of the names Limbert gave to formations and places during his travels are still in use.

A series of newspaper and magazine articles written by Limbert were later published about this and previous treks, which increased public awareness of the area. The most famous of these was an article that appeared in a 1924 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot; where he called the area &quot;Craters of the Moon&quot;, helping to solidify the use of that name. In the article, he wrote about the beauty of the cobalt blue of the Blue Dragon Flow:

The only visitor center in Craters of the Moon, the Robert Limbert Visitor Center, was named after him in 1990.

=== Protection and later history ===
In large part due to Limbert&#x27;s work, Craters of the Moon National Monument was proclaimed on May 2, 1924, by U.S. President Calvin Coolidge to preserve the &quot;weird and scenic landscape&quot; of the area. The Craters Inn and several cabins were built in 1927 for the convenience of visitors. The Mission 66 program initiated construction of today&#x27;s road system, visitor center, bookstore, campground, and comfort station in 1956, and in 1959 the Craters of the Moon Natural History Association was formed to assist the monument in educational activities. The addition of an island of vegetation completely surrounded by lava known as Carey Kipuka increased the size of the monument by in 1962.

Since then, the park has been expanded. On October 23, 1970, Congress set aside a large part of the monument——as Craters of the Moon National Wilderness Area, protecting that part under the National Wilderness Preservation System. Along with Petrified Forest National Wilderness Area, this became one of the first two designations on land administered by the National Park Service.

From 1969 to 1972, NASA visited the Moon through the Apollo program and found that its surface does not closely resemble this part of Idaho. While the Moon&#x27;s craters are largely impact craters, those seen at Craters of the Moon were instead created by volcanic eruptions. Apollo astronauts Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, Eugene Cernan, and Joe Engle performed part of their training at Craters of the Moon Lava Field by learning to look for and collect good rock specimens in an unfamiliar and harsh environment.

For many years, geologists, biologists and environmentalists have advocated for the expansion of the protected area and its transformation into a national park. Part of that goal was reached in 2000 when the monument was expanded 13-fold, from to its current size, to encompass the entire Great Rift zone and its three lava fields. Opposition by cattle interests and hunters to a simple expansion plan led to a compromise of having the National Park Service portion of the addition, which comprises the lava flows, become a national preserve in 2002 (which allows hunting, not ordinarily permitted in national parks and monuments in the U.S.).

In 2017, the monument was designated an International Dark Sky Park by DarkSky International due to its exceptional preservation of its naturally dark night skies.

Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve is co-managed by the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), both under the Department of the Interior; the BLM managing the non-lava grasslands. In March 2017, the Idaho Senate voted in favor of petitioning Congress to designate Craters of the Moon a national park.

== Geology ==
The Snake River Plain is a volcanic province that was created by a series of cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 16 million years ago. The hotspot under the Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hotspot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11 million years ago but &quot;moved&quot; as the North American Plate migrated northwestward. Pressure from the hotspot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hotspot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.

Leftover heat from this hotspot was later liberated by basin and range-associated rifting and created the many overlapping lava flows that make up the lava beds of Idaho. The largest rift zone is the Great Rift, and it is from this &quot;Great Rift fissure system&quot; that the Craters of the Moon, King&#x27;s Bowl, and Wapi lava fields were created. The Great Rift is a National Natural Landmark.

In spite of their fresh appearance, the oldest flows in the Craters of the Moon Lava Field are 15,000 years old and the youngest erupted about 2,100 years ago, according to Mel Kuntz and other USGS geologists. Nevertheless, the volcanic fissures at Craters of the Moon are considered to be dormant, not extinct, and are expected to erupt again in less than 1,000 years. There are eight major eruptive periods recognized in the Craters of the Moon Lava Field. Each period lasted about 1000 years or less and were separated by relatively quiet periods that lasted between 500 and 3,000 years. Individual lava flows traveled up to with the Blue Dragon Flow being the longest.

King&#x27;s Bowl Lava Field erupted during a single fissure eruption on the southern part of the Great Rift about 2,250 years ago. This eruption probably lasted only a few hours to a few days. The field preserves explosion pits, lava lakes, squeeze-ups, basalt mounds, and an ash blanket. The Wapi Lava Field probably formed from a fissure eruption at the same time as the King&#x27;s Bowl eruption. More prolonged activity over a period of months to a few years led to the formation of low shield volcanoes in the Wapi field. The Bear Trap Cave lava tube, between the Craters of the Moon and the Wapi lava fields, is a cave system more than long. The lava tube is remarkable for its length and for the number of well-preserved lava cave features, such as lava stalactites and curbs, the latter marking high stands of the flowing lava frozen on the lava tube walls. The lava tubes and pit craters of the park are known for their preservation of winter ice and snow into the hot summer months due to shielding from the sun and the insulating properties of basalt.

A typical eruption along the Great Rift and similar basaltic rift systems starts with a curtain of very fluid lava shooting up to high along a segment of the rift up to long. As the eruption continues, pressure and heat decrease, and the chemistry of the lava becomes slightly more silica-rich. The curtain of lava responds by breaking apart into separate vents. Various types of volcanoes may form at these vents: gas-rich, pulverized lava creates cinder cones, and pasty lava blobs form spatter cones. Later stages of an eruption push lava streams out through the side or base of cinder cones, which usually ends the life of the cinder cone (North Crater, Watchman, and the Sheep Trail Buttes are notable exceptions). This will sometimes breach part of the cone and carry it away as large and craggy blocks of cinder. Solid crust forms over lava streams and lava tubes are created when lava vacates its course.

Geologists feared that a large earthquake that shook Borah Peak, Idaho&#x27;s tallest mountain, in 1983 would restart volcanic activity at Craters of the Moon, though this proved not to be the case. Geologists predict that the area will experience its next eruption sometime in the next 900 years, with activity most likely to occur within the next 100 years.

== Biology==
=== Conditions ===
All organisms that live in and around Craters of the Moon are under great environmental stress due to constant dry winds and heat-absorbing black lavas that tend to quickly sap water from living things. Summer soil temperatures often exceed and plant cover is generally less than 5% on cinder cones and about 15% over the entire park. Adaptation is therefore necessary for survival in this semi-arid harsh climate.

Water is usually only found deep inside holes at the bottom of blow-out craters. Animals therefore get most or all of the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.

The shaded north slopes of cinder cones provide more protection from direct sunlight and prevailing southwesterly winds and have a more persistent snow cover (an important water source in early spring). These parts of cinder cones are therefore colonized by plants first.

Gaps between lava flows were sometimes cut off from surrounding vegetation. These literal islands of habitat are called kīpukas, a Hawaiian word describing older land surrounded by younger lava. Carey Kīpuka is one such area in the southernmost part of the monument and is used as a benchmark to measure how plant cover has changed in less pristine parts of southern Idaho.

=== Plants ===
There are over 600 species of plants known to grow in the park which make up 93 plant communities. When wildflowers are not in bloom, most of the vegetation is found in semi-hidden pockets and consists of pine trees, junipers, and sagebrush. Strategies used by plants to cope with the adverse conditions include:

* Drought tolerance by physiological adaptations such as the ability to survive extreme dehydration or the ability to extract water from very dry soil. Sagebrush and antelope bitterbrush are examples.
* Drought avoidance by having small, hairy, or succulent leaves to minimize moisture loss or otherwise conserve water. Hairs on scorpionweed, the succulent parts of the prickly pear cactus, and the small leaves of the wirelettuce are all local examples.

* Drought escape by growing in small crevices or near persistent water supplies, or by staying dormant for about 95% of the year. Mosses and ferns in the area grow near constant water sources such as natural potholes and seeps from ice caves. Scabland penstemon, dwarf mountain fleabane, and gland cinquefoil grow in shallow crevices. Syringa, bush rockspirea, fernbush, and even limber pines grow in larger crevices. Dwarf monkeyflowers carry out their entire life cycle during the brief wet part of the year and survive in seed form the rest of the year.

A plant commonly seen on the cinder flats is dwarf buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum ovalifolium&quot; var. &quot;depressum&quot;), a flowering plant tall with a root system wide. The root system monopolizes soil moisture in its immediate area, resulting in individual plants that are evenly spaced. Consequently, many visitors ask park rangers if the buckwheat were systematically planted.

Wildflowers bloom from early May to late September but most are gone by late August. Moisture from snowmelt along with some rainfall in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow in the area are arrowleaf balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, turpentine parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, Indian paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon, and wild onion.

=== Animals ===
Years of cataloging by biologists and park rangers have recorded more than 2000 species of insects, 12 reptiles, 203 birds, 59 mammals, and three amphibians. Birds and rodents are seen most frequently in the Craters of the Moon area. Grizzly bears, bison, and bighorn sheep once roamed this area but have long ago become locally extinct. 11 species of bats have been recorded in Craters of the Moon with as many as five others potentially occurring in the park. Nearly all of these bat species have been documented hibernating within the park&#x27;s boundaries, typically making use of the area&#x27;s numerous lava tubes, making it an important bat habitat. Traditional livestock grazing continues within the grass/shrublands administered by the Bureau of Land Management.

Most desert animals are nocturnal, or mainly active at night. Nocturnal behavior is an adaptation to both predation and hot summer daytime temperatures. Nocturnal animals at Craters of the Moon include woodrats, skunks, foxes, bobcats, mountain lions, bats, nighthawks, owls, and most other small, desert rodents.

Animals that are most active at dawn and dusk, when temperatures are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less visible to predators but is bright enough to allow them to locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.

Some desert animals are diurnal, or primarily active during the day. These include ground squirrels, marmots, chipmunks, lizards, snakes, hawks, and eagles.

Many animals have a specific temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards brumate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation that allows them to avoid the hottest and driest periods.

Unique populations of Great Basin pocket mouse, American pika, and yellow-pine chipmunk are found at Craters of the Moon and nowhere else. Lava tube beetles and other cave-dwelling invertebrates are found only in the lava tubes of eastern Idaho.

==== Pronghorn migration ====
Pronghorn migration across the northern Snake River Plain has been monitored since the Lava Lake Institute along with the Wildlife Conservation Society, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, and the Pioneers Alliance conducted a study of their movements from 2008 to 2010. Pronghorns from the Pioneer Mountains were fitted with radio collars to track their movements throughout the year. These studies showed that in the spring and fall, the animals travel about one-way along the southern edges of the mountains to reach their summer and winter ranges. In the winter, they join the largest wintering herd in Idaho on the Big Desert/Idaho National Laboratory range.

The narrowest part of this migration corridor is in the northern part of Craters of the Moon where pronghorns typically follow a single trail for about . Archaeological evidence suggests local indigenous peoples such as the Shoshone and Bannock knew about this route and likely conducted seasonal pronghorn hunts in this area coinciding with pronghorn migration. Due to the narrow size of this natural funnel, the National Park Service has monitored the number of pronghorns migrating through this area using motion-sensitive trail cameras since 2012. While an average of 400 pronghorns make the migration each season, as many as 700 animals have been counted in a single migration.

As a result of the initial study, the National Park Service conducted a survey of its boundary fence and found that the fence along the northern section of Craters of the Moon interfered with pronghorn migration where it intersected the route. While the fence was originally erected to prevent neighboring livestock from entering the park, the survey found that the types of fencing used made it extremely difficult for animals to slip under it. When confronted with a fence, pronghorns typically crawl under it rather than try to jump over. The fence was also difficult for other animals to jump over.

From 2009 to 2017, the park service worked with the Utah Conservation Corps to reconstruct the boundary fence in this area as well as another area several miles northeast to be wildlife friendly. This included removing some fence segments and implementing gates and drop panels where possible.

==== Mule deer ====
In May 1980, wildlife researcher Brad Griffith of the University of Idaho started a three-year study to mark and count the mule deer in the monument. The National Park Service was concerned that the local herd might grow so large that it would damage its habitat. It was found that this group of mule deer had developed a drought-evasion strategy unique for its species.

The deer arrive in the southern part of the pre-2000 extent of the monument mid-April each year once winter snows have melted away enough to allow for foraging. Griffith found that by late summer plants in the area have already matured and dried to the point that they can no longer provide enough moisture to sustain the deer. In late July after about 12 days above and warm nights above the herd migrates north to the Pioneer Mountains to obtain water from free-flowing streams and shade themselves in aspen and Douglas fir groves. Rain in late September prompts the herd to return to the monument to feed on bitterbrush until snow in November triggers them to migrate back to their winter range. This herd, therefore, has a dual summer range. It is also very productive with one of the highest fawn survival rates of any herd in the species.

Afternoon winds usually die down in the evening, prompting behavioral modifications in the herd. The deer avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the wind is not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.

== Recreational activities ==
A wide variety of volcanic formations and features are accessible from the Loop Road, the only developed area of the park. Wildflowers, shrubs, trees, and wildlife can be seen by hiking on one of the many trails in the monument or by just pulling over into one of the turn-offs. More rugged hiking opportunities are available in the Craters of the Moon backcountry areas, away from the Loop Road.

# &quot;Visitor Center:&quot; The Robert Limbert Visitor Center is located at the entrance to the scenic Loop Road. Various displays and publications are available along with a short film about the geology and history of the area help to orient visitors. Ranger-led walks and other programs are available in the summer and cover topics such as history, wildlife, plants, or geology.
# &quot;North Crater Flow Trail:&quot; An easy, paved trail less than long crosses the lava flow for which this trail is named. This lava flow erupted from neighboring North Crater cinder cone and is one of the youngest lava flows of the Craters of the Moon lava field. This is one of the places visitors can view the Blue Dragon Flow, a lava flow named for the purplish-blue tint on its surface. Good examples of pahoehoe, a&#x27;a, and some block lava are readily visible along with large, rafted crater wall fragments called the Monoliths. The Monoliths were once part of a cinder cone which was ripped apart when the volcano&#x27;s lava-filled crater was breached. North Crater Trail, a separate trail, begins past the North Crater Flow trailhead. This strenuous, long trail continues into North Crater, around Big Craters, and ends at the Spatter Cones parking lot.
# &quot;Devils Orchard Nature Trail:&quot; Devils Orchard is a group of lava-transported cinder cone fragments (or rafted blocks) that stand in cinders. Like the Monoliths at North Crater Flow, they were once part of the North Crater cinder cone but broke off during an eruption. A paved, accessible, long loop trail through these formations and trees of the &quot;orchard&quot; is available. Interpretive displays can be read along the trail.
# &quot;Inferno Cone:&quot; This stop hosts a short, steep trail up to the top of the cinder cone which provides an overlook of the entire monument. From there, the Spatter Cones can be seen just to the southwest along with the line of cinder cones along the Great Rift. In the distance is Big Cinder Butte. At over tall, it is one of the world&#x27;s largest, purely basaltic cinder cones. Further away are the Pioneer Mountains just north of the highway, and beyond the park are the White Knob Mountains, the Lost River Range, and the Lemhi Range. On the clearest days, the tops of the Tetons may be seen, about to the east.
# &quot;Spatter Cones:&quot; Both the Spatter Cones and Big Craters sit directly along part of one of the fissures of the Great Rift. Spatter cones are created by accumulations of pasty, gas-poor lava as they erupt from a vent. Two of the Spatter Cones in this area can be accessed by short trails where visitors can look inside the cones. Big Craters is a cinder cone complex visitors can hike along the rim of about above a short, steep trail.
#&quot;Tree Molds:&quot; The Tree Molds Trail is an area where lava flows overran part of a forest. The trees were incinerated but as some of them burned they released enough water to cool the lava to form an impression. Some of these casts survived the eruption and mark the exact location and shape of the burning trees in the lava. Both holes and horizontal molds were left, some still showing shapes indicative of bark. Tree molds are visible at the end of the Tree Molds Trail, from the parking area. The Wilderness Trail also leaves from this parking lot and extends nearly into the Craters of the Moon Wilderness before gradually disappearing near The Sentinel cinder cone. The Broken Top Loop trail is the third trail that begins at this area and encircles the youngest cinder cone in the park and can be done separately or as part of a longer trek on the Wilderness Trail. This trail features some of the greatest geological and ecological diversity of any trail in the park. A pull-off on the spur road leading to the Tree Molds area showcases the Lava Cascades, a lava river created from the Blue Dragon Flow that temporarily pooled in Big Sink, a former lava lake.
# &quot;Caves Area:&quot; The final stop on Loop Road which, as the name suggests, features a collection of lava tubes. Formed from one of the most recent lava flows, the caves are a walk from the parking lot and include Dewdrop Cave and Indian Tunnel. The caves are open to visitors in the summer, but a free permit is required to enter. Flashlights are needed in Dewdrop Cave and strongly recommended for Indian Tunnel. None of the caves are developed beyond the entrances and require climbing or scrambling over loose rocks. Lava tubes are created when the sides and surface of a lava flow hardens. If the fluid interior flows away, a cave is left behind.

The Lava Flow Campground has 41 first come, first served sites. Camping facilities are basic but do include seasonal water, restrooms, charcoal grills, and trash containers. National Park Service rangers present evening programs at the campground amphitheater in the summer.

The park has a Junior Ranger program which enables children to earn a badge.

Backcountry hiking is available in the Craters of the Moon National Wilderness Area and the much larger backcountry area beyond. Only two trails enter the Wilderness area, the Wilderness Trail and Tree Molds Trail, and even those stop after a few miles. From there, most hikers follow the Great Rift and explore its series of seldom-visited volcanic features. All overnight backcountry hikes require registration at the visitor center. No water is available in the backcountry and the dry climate combined with the high elevation quickly dehydrates hikers. Avoiding summer heat and winter cold are therefore recommended by rangers. Pets, campfires, and all mechanized vehicles, including bicycles, are not allowed in the Wilderness area.

Skiing and snowshoeing are allowed on the Loop Road after it closes to traffic in late November because of snow drifts. Typically, there are of snow by January and by February. Skiing off the Loop Road is allowed in most places but may be dangerous due to sharp lava and hidden holes under the snow. Blizzards and other adverse weather conditions may occur in the winter.

<doc id="264312" wikidata="Q252474" url="?curid=264312" title="Lucky Millinder">
<text>Lucius Venable &quot;Lucky&quot; Millinder (August 8, 1910 – September 28, 1966) was an American swing and rhythm-and-blues bandleader. Although he could not read or write music, did not play an instrument and rarely sang, his showmanship and musical taste made his bands successful. His group was said to have been the greatest big band to play rhythm and blues, and gave work to a number of musicians who later became influential at the dawn of the rock and roll era. He was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame in 1986.

==Early career==
Millinder was born Lucius Venables in Anniston, Alabama, United States. He took the surname Millinder as a child, and was raised in Chicago. In the 1920s, he worked in clubs, ballrooms, and theatres in Chicago as a master of ceremonies and dancer. He first fronted a band in 1931 for an RKO theater tour, and in 1932 took over the leadership of Doc Crawford&#x27;s orchestra in Harlem. He also freelanced elsewhere.

In 1933, he took a band to Europe, playing residencies in Monte Carlo and Paris. He returned to New York to take over the leadership of the Mills Blue Rhythm Band in 1934, which included Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen, Charlie Shavers, Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison and J. C. Higginbotham, and which had a regular slot at The Cotton Club.

==With his own orchestra==
In 1938, he teamed-up with pianist Bill Doggett to front Doggett&#x27;s group. By 1940, Millinder had formed a completely new orchestra, which included Doggett and the drummer &quot;Panama&quot; Francis. Around this time he discovered the established gospel singer and guitarist Rosetta Tharpe, with whom his ensembles performed for many years, and first recorded with on four cuts for Decca Records in 1938.

He established a residency at New York&#x27;s Savoy Ballroom, and won a contract with Decca. Dizzy Gillespie was the band&#x27;s trumpeter for a while and was featured on Millinder&#x27;s first charting hit, &quot;When the Lights Go On Again (All Over the World)&quot;, which reached number 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 14 on the pop chart in 1942. The follow-up records &quot;Apollo Jump&quot; and &quot;Sweet Slumber&quot; were also big hits, with vocals by Trevor Bacon.

By the mid-1940s, the band was drifting towards what came to be known as rhythm and blues. Other band members around this time included the saxophonists Bull Moose Jackson, Tab Smith and Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis and the pianist Sir Charles Thompson. In 1944, Millinder recruited the singer Wynonie Harris, and their recording of &quot;Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well&quot; became the group&#x27;s biggest hit in 1945, staying at number 1 on the R&amp;B chart for eight weeks and also reaching number 7 on the US pop chart. After Harris left for a solo career, Millinder followed up with another hit, &quot;Shorty&#x27;s Got to Go&quot;, on which he took lead vocals. Soon afterwards, Ruth Brown became the band&#x27;s singer for a short period before her own solo career took off.

Towards the end of World War II and into the post-war period, the economic situation for touring ensembles (including gas-rationing and entertainment taxes) began to favor smaller bands (such as Louis Jordan&#x27;s), and limited the number of appearances orchestras such as Millinder&#x27;s could command. In the late 1940s, the band toured all the larger R&amp;B auditoriums, although it had few chart hits for several years.

In 1949, the band left Decca Records and joined RCA Victor and then King Records, recording with the singers Big John Greer and Annisteen Allen. The band&#x27;s last big hit was &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting Just for You&quot;, with Allen, in 1951, which reached number 2 on the R&amp;B chart and number 19 on the pop chart. A year earlier, Millinder&#x27;s track &quot;Silent George&quot; had become a dirty blues hit.

==Later years==
By 1952, Millinder began working as a radio DJ. He continued touring with his band, but his style was falling out of favor, and the band&#x27;s history of many personnel changes began to affect its sound. In 1954, he took over the leadership of the house band at the Apollo Theater for a while. He effectively retired from performing around 1955, although his final recordings were in 1960.

He became active in music publishing and in public relations for a whiskey distillery. He died of a liver ailment in New York City in September 1966.

<text>David Michael Navarro (born June 7, 1967) is an American guitarist. He is best known as a member of the rock band Jane&#x27;s Addiction, with whom he has recorded four studio albums. Between 1993 and 1998, Navarro was the guitarist of Red Hot Chili Peppers, recording one studio album, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; (1995), before departing. He has also released one solo album, &quot;Trust No One&quot; (2001). Navarro has also been a member of Jane&#x27;s Addiction-related bands Deconstruction and the Panic Channel.

AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato described Navarro as &quot;one of alternative rock&#x27;s first true guitar heroes&quot;, with an eclectic playing style that merges heavy metal, psychedelia, and modern rock.
&quot;He&#x27;s one of the last great guitarists,&quot; said former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins.

Navarro is also a host and judge on &quot;Ink Master&quot;, an American tattoo competition reality series that aired on Paramount Network (formerly called &quot;Spike&quot;) from 2012 to 2020 and Paramount+ since 2022.

==Early life==
David Michael Navarro was born on June 7, 1967, in Santa Monica, California, the only child of James Raul Navarro and Constance Colleen Hopkins. His paternal grandparents were Mexican immigrants. His grandfather Gabriel Navarro was close friends with Mexican silent film actor Ramón Novarro, who allegedly adopted his friend&#x27;s surname for the stage, though it was altered due to a typing error.

Navarro picked up the guitar at age 7, being inspired by his cousin, singer-songwriter Dan Navarro. He said that &quot;When I was very young, it was always Jimi Hendrix.&quot; He was also fascinated by Yngwie Malmsteen for a brief period. Navarro also stated that he learned a lot from Robert Smith of the Cure and Daniel Ash of Bauhaus. He also said: &quot;And I have always loved all the different guitarists that have been in Siouxsie and the Banshees&quot;. He considers that &quot;The great innovators, for me, are still Hendrix and [Jimmy] Page.&quot; Van Halen&#x27;s debut album was another reason why he learned to play guitar. To this day, his tastes range from eccentric virtuosos like Steve Vai and Al Di Meola, to experimenters like Kevin Shields and old school blues players like Junior Kimbrough.

He attended Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, California, where he was a member of the marching band with future Jane&#x27;s Addiction bandmate Stephen Perkins.

==Career==
===1986–1993===
Navarro joined the band Jane&#x27;s Addiction in 1986 as the lead guitarist after he was recommended to vocalist Perry Farrell by Perkins. Over the next five years, Jane&#x27;s Addiction released three albums, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Addiction&quot; (1987), &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; (1988) and &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot; (1990). Personal tensions, however, led to their breakup in 1991. The Lollapalooza festival was created by Farrell as a farewell tour for Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

After the departure of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; original rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin in August 1991, Navarro was the first choice of lead singer Axl Rose to replace Stradlin; despite four attempts to have him come in and play with Slash, he never showed up. However, he later went on to play on the 1999 Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Oh My God&quot;, which was featured on the &quot;End of Days&quot; soundtrack. In 1993, Navarro formed Deconstruction with Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s Eric Avery on vocals and bass and Michael Murphy on drums. The band put out one self-titled album in 1994. Rick Rubin was involved in the production and Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes makes a guest appearance. They did not tour due to Avery&#x27;s exhaustion after Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

===1993–1998===
Navarro joined Red Hot Chili Peppers in September 1993. His first large-scale performance with the band was at &quot;Woodstock &#x27;94&quot;. The only album on which Navarro played with Red Hot Chili Peppers, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;, was released in 1995. The band later recorded and released a cover of the Ohio Players&#x27; song &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; for the &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; soundtrack, which was released as a single. The band also contributed to the John Lennon song &quot;I Found Out&quot; to the &quot;Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon&quot; album, as well as the &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; outtake &quot;Melancholy Mechanics&quot; to the &quot;Twister&quot; soundtrack.

In 1995, Navarro played guitar for Alanis Morissette&#x27;s track &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; on one of the 1990s&#x27; most successful albums, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;.

Despite mixed reviews, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; sold over eight million copies worldwide and produced three hit singles. Navarro toured with Jane&#x27;s Addiction for their 1997 Relapse tour with Flea on bass. After two years of touring on and off with Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his subsequent heroin relapse, Navarro was fired in 1998 over &quot;creative differences&quot;. Navarro would later explain the main reasons for departing as being a result of not being given &quot;the same latitude&quot; with regards to his drug usage and recovery as Anthony Kiedis who was also undergoing a similar issue, and his musical sensibilities never really matching with the rest of the band.

Navarro also remixed Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do&quot; for her &quot;Janet Remixed&quot; album during this time.

In 1999, Navarro also appeared in a guest role as an escaped prison convict on an episode of Martial Law titled &quot;Friendly Skies&quot;, alongside fellow rockers Bret Michaels, Rick Springfield and David Silveria.

===2001–2005===
The summer 2001 album &quot;Trust No One&quot; (Capitol Records) marked his solo debut. The band assembled for the accompanying US tour consisted of Navarro, guitarist Dave Kushner (who would go on to form Velvet Revolver), bassist Miiko Watanabe and drummer Angel Roché, Jr.. He would later state that touring as a vocalist was harder to prepare for every night than just playing guitar, and wouldn&#x27;t want to sing again. In 2002, Jane&#x27;s Addiction reformed with bass player Chris Chaney and started work on a new album. The band entered the studio with veteran rock producer Bob Ezrin, resulting in the album &quot;Strays&quot; and the Lollapalooza 2003 tour in support of the album. In 2002, Michael Jackson performed at the Apollo Theater for the Democratic National Convention, and Navarro was set to play guitar for his hit song &quot;Black or White&quot;. The song was ultimately cut from the set, but there are pictures and video snippets for the rehearsals. During this time Navarro also made a cameo in Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Bringin&#x27; On the Heartbreak&quot; music video.

Navarro began working with Camp Freddy during this time. In 2003, he and his fiancée, Carmen Electra, agreed to have their wedding preparations filmed for an MTV show titled &quot;Til Death Do Us Part&quot;; Camp Freddy played at the reception. The show was a success and was released on DVD in the fall of 2005. Navarro&#x27;s book, &quot;Don&#x27;t Try This at Home&quot;, was published on October 5, 2004, by ReganBooks, and quickly became a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; bestseller.

Navarro appeared in two tournaments on &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot; in 2004. In the third tournament of the series, he won his qualifying game and appeared in the championship round. In the fourth series, he appeared only in a qualifying round.

===2006 to present ===
Navarro co-hosted with Brooke Burke, two seasons of the Mark Burnett television series: &quot;Rock Star: INXS&quot; and &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot;. Navarro and his band, the Panic Channel, released their album &quot;One&quot;, in August 2006. They toured with Rock Star Supernova (the band formed from the series) in January/February 2007. During this period, Navarro had his own internet radio station. He soon broadened his creativity with an internet talk show called: &quot;Dave Navarro&#x27;s SPREAD TV&quot;, which was streamed on ManiaTV.com and was made available for download on iTunes. The show highlighted avant-garde subjects, artistry, and the human condition. Videos from the series are also available on Navarro&#x27;s YouTube channel.


In 2007, Navarro also teamed with Teravision to direct his first adult movie, &quot;Broken&quot; starring Sasha Grey (who he was also managing at the time), in the first of a planned series of celebrity-directed adult movies. This effort won &quot;Best High End All-Sex Release&quot; at the 2008 AVN Awards. Navarro appeared in Season 1 and Season 2 of &quot;Z Rock&quot; with Brooklyn-based band ZO2 on IFC. In 2008, he recorded additional riffs for the version of &quot;Black Cat&quot; performed on Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rock Witchu Tour, appearing on screens during the rendition.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction reunited once more in 2008 with all of the original members. Soon after performing together for the first time in 17 years at the NME Award ceremony in Los Angeles, the band was contacted by Trent Reznor. Reznor began working with Jane&#x27;s Addiction in his studio; they recorded and released two songs (&quot;Chip Away&quot; and &quot;Whores&quot;) online on the &quot;NINJA 2009 Tour Sampler&quot;. Both songs were previously released on their self-titled 1987 live album. This time together in the studio led directly to the pairing of Nine Inch Nails and Jane&#x27;s Addiction for a worldwide tour in 2009. The tour was branded the NIN/JA tour by fans.

During August 2009, Navarro toured southern California as part of the Billy Corgan-led band Spirits in the Sky.

In 2010, he posed naked for PETA&#x27;s anti-fur campaign, &quot;Ink Not Mink&quot;. He stripped down again for the group&#x27;s anti animal-testing campaign in 2013.

In 2011, Navarro appeared as the &quot;Director&quot; of a Rock and Roll Fantasy Camp, playing a complicated passage for a &quot;camper&quot; to emulate, in a commercial for Citibank.

Navarro featured on the track &quot;Girls/Fast Cars&quot; on the album &quot;The Wombats Proudly Present: This Modern Glitch&quot; by indie rock band the Wombats.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers were named 2012 inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but Navarro was not included among the band&#x27;s members inducted. When the announcement was made of the induction, Navarro said he was happy for the band but later said he had no plans to attend the ceremony, which was held in April 2012.

Navarro appeared in four episodes of the FX drama &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; in 2012 and appeared as a guest on an episode of &quot;Talking Dead&quot;. In February 2013, he had a guest role in &quot;Law and Order: SVU&quot;, playing a sound engineer. In January 2012, Navarro became host and judge on the Paramount show &quot;Ink Master&quot;.

In 2018, Navarro&#x27;s personal assistant, actress Kelsey Gunn, started an online web series on Instagram known as &quot;Assisting Navarro&quot;, providing an entertaining look into Kelsey&#x27;s life and tasks as Navarro&#x27;s assistant. This culminated in the release of the Assisting Navarro short film, which was released on January 31, 2020.

In 2019, Navarro formed an art collective known as Duel Diagnosis specializing in &quot;apparel, art, and spectacle&quot; focused on conversations regarding mental health and illness.

In 2020, Navarro began jamming with Chris Chaney and Taylor Hawkins, ultimately forming the &quot;Yacht Goth&quot; supergroup NHC (Navarro Hawkins Chaney). They made their live debut at Ohana Encore Festival on October 1, 2021. The band would perform a number of shows that featured guest musicians such as Barbara Gruska of The Belle Brigade, Pat Smear, Chad Smith, and Matt Cameron. and release a few singles and an EP up until Hawkins&#x27; death in 2022.

On February 8, 2020, Navarro performed with Jane&#x27;s Addiction at a memorial show for Andrew Burkle, son of billionaire Ronald Burkle who died in January 2020. Navarro was photographed for the first time in 23 years with his former Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmates, who also performed. John Frusciante, who replaced Navarro in the band back in 1998, performed briefly with Jane&#x27;s Addiction marking the first time the two Chili Peppers guitarists have shared a stage together.

On December 20, 2021, Navarro and Billy Morrison held their third annual Above Ground benefit concert in Los Angeles. They were joined onstage by Anthony Kiedis for a performance of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. This marked the first performance of Kiedis and Navarro together in 24 years since Navarro was fired from the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Navarro sat out a joint tour between Jane&#x27;s Addiction and the Smashing Pumpkins in 2022 due to long COVID; his place was filled by Queens of the Stone Age guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen for the duration of the tour. Navarro was again absent from Jane&#x27;s Addiction on their 2023 tour while still battling the effects of long COVID, and Josh Klinghoffer played guitar in his place.

Jane&#x27;s Addiction returned to the studio in 2023 to record new material and announced that Navarro hadn&#x27;t participated due to his ongoing struggle with long COVID. Navarro returned to the band in May 2024 with the classic Jane&#x27;s Addiction lineup performing their first show together in fourteen years on May 23, 2024. The show featured two new songs, the first new songs from the classic lineup in thirty-four years. The would embark on a 2024 tour of Europe and the U.S. with the original lineup for the first time in 15 years.

During this reunion tour, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported tensions between band members during their New York City shows in September. On September 13, their show at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston was cut short after Farrell shoved and punched Navarro, and was restrained by crew members. Farrell&#x27;s wife, Etty Lau Farrell, said Farrell had been suffering from tinnitus and a sore throat and felt his voice was being drowned out by the band. She acknowledged animosity between the band members and said that Avery had physically attacked Perry during the incident. The following day, Jane&#x27;s Addiction issued an apology and canceled their scheduled show at Bridgeport, Connecticut.

On November 19, 2024, Navarro announced (along with Billy Idol guitarist Billy Morrison) the fourth installment of the &quot;Above Ground&quot; benefit concert, scheduled to take place on January 25, 2025, at The Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, California. The event will celebrate vinyl &quot;as an art form&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Mother&#x27;s murder===
Navarro&#x27;s mother and aunt were murdered by his mother&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, John (Dean) Riccardi, in March 1983. Riccardi was arrested in 1991, thanks to a viewer tip after Riccardi was featured on the television series &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. During his appearance on &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; in 2004, Navarro stated that he was supposed to visit and stay with his mother on the night of her murder but at the last minute went to stay with his father. In 2015, Navarro released the documentary &quot;Mourning Son&quot;, which details his abuse at the hands of Riccardi, his mother&#x27;s murder and his spiral into drug addiction, as well as the pain he has had to overcome in the years since her death. The documentary culminated in Navarro meeting his mother&#x27;s killer in prison.

===Relationships===
Navarro has been married three times, to celebrity makeup artist Tania Goddard-Saylor (1990–1992, divorced); Rhian Gittins (1994, annulled); and model and actress Carmen Electra (2003–2007, divorced).

===Politics===
Navarro was invited to be a performer at the 2002 Democratic National Convention fundraiser titled “A Night at the Apollo”, and at the 2012 Republican National Convention in which Mitt Romney was nominated for president. In 2016, he described his views in a tweet as &quot;Libertarian&quot;.
Navarro had stated he was supporting Marianne Williamson as a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. He subsequently expressed support for Tulsi Gabbard, including having her on his show.

==Equipment==
He began using PRS Guitars on the Lollapalooza tour in 1991. His signature model PRS (White with Gold Hardware) is now his primary stage guitar and is based on their Custom 24 model. He has several models in his regular stage and studio rig (like a double neck version), and was only the third PRS artist to have both a Maryland-made and SE version of their Signature Model.

Prior to his PRS signature line of guitars, Dave was mostly known for playing Ibanez RG guitars (like his RG with the Nothing&#x27;s Shocking cover photo custom paint or Tele styled gold top) and Gibson Les Pauls, all of which were used for the first two Jane&#x27;s Addiction albums. Since late 2008, he has been seen both live and in studio using a custom white Ibanez RG, with a humbucker/single/single pickup layout, gold hardware, and a vintage style tremolo, essentially an Ibanez version of his PRS Guitars Signature Model. He also used a blue Parker Fly guitar during his stint in RHCP, for songs that required an acoustic sound live. In 2019 through Guitar Center LA, Dave was reunited with his Custom Ibanez RG with Nothing Shocking graphic after it came into their store. Dave pawned it for drug money back in the &#x27;90s and forgot to pick the guitar back up. For music videos, Dave has primarily been seen to use Danelectro guitars (seen in &quot;Rexall&quot; and &quot;Warped&quot;), Fernandes guitars (seen in &quot;Hungry&quot;), Gibson Flying V (seen in &quot;Bringin&#x27; On The Heartbreak&quot;), and Custom Shop Fender Stratocasters (seen in &quot;Aeroplane&quot; and used for a majority of his time in RHCP). He has also used a Fernandes Mini Traveling NOMAD guitar to record the guitar solo on &quot;Walkabout&quot;.

Dave&#x27;s choice of guitar effects pedals are all made from BOSS. His amp preference was for the Marshall JCM 900 amp series which he preferred for their clean and dirty channels. In 2022, Dave switched over to using Friedman amps live. His preference for strings are Ernie Ball.

Epiphone Guitars (a subsidiary of Gibson) released its Dave Navarro Artist Acoustic in July 2010. According to an interview with Navarro on Gibson.com, the new guitar is based upon the classic Gibson (and Epiphone) &quot;Hummingbird&quot; design, and has already been played by the guitarist in the studio while recording with Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

In 2024, the Fender Custom Shop and the Jimi Hendrix Estate had master builder Andy Hicks build Navarro a replica of Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Izabella&quot; guitar that he performed with at Woodstock. He would play the guitar live at the New Orleans stop of the Jane&#x27;s Addiction 2024 tour. On September 18, 2024, Navarro announced a collaboration between himself, Supreme, and Jim Dunlop to release a limited edition Wah-wah Pedal.

<text>David Lee Roth (born October 10, 1954) is an American rock singer. Known for his wild and energetic stage persona, he was the lead vocalist of the hard rock band Van Halen for three stints: from 1974 to 1985, during 1996, and from 2006 to when they disbanded in 2020. He has also had a successful solo career, releasing numerous RIAA-certified Gold and Platinum albums. After more than two decades apart, Roth re-joined Van Halen in 2006 for a North American tour that became the highest-grossing in the band&#x27;s history, and one of the highest-grossing of that year. In 2007, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Van Halen.

==Early life==
Roth was born in Bloomington, Indiana, to an ophthalmologist, Nathan Lee Roth, and a teacher, Sibyl Roth. He has two sisters, one of whom is Lisa Roth, creator of the Rockabye Baby! lullaby music. The family is of Jewish heritage. Roth&#x27;s uncle Manny Roth was the owner of Cafe Wha? in New York City. All four of Roth&#x27;s grandparents were immigrants from Russia and his great-grandfather was a Lithuanian cavalryman. From an early age, Roth had an interest in art, especially film and radio; he said his first music idol was Al Jolson.

Roth spent much of his youth in New Castle, Indiana. In a 2019 interview with Q95&#x27;s &quot;Stuck and Gunner&quot; he explained: &quot;My grandparents moved to New Castle in 1913. It&#x27;s in the sense of humor, the &#x27;get it done&#x27; and how we do get it done approach work ethic of Van Halen, frankly. It&#x27;s a Midwest approach, not some flakey Hollywood horse manure.&quot; The Roths also briefly lived in Swampscott, Massachusetts. 

In his teens, the family relocated to Pasadena, California. David attended The Webb Schools in Claremont, California, and John Muir High School in Pasadena. Roth&#x27;s parents arranged for him to receive treatment with a psychiatrist for three years because he was prone to daily bouts of hyperactivity, dubbed &quot;monkey time&quot;. Roth also attended a horse ranch for troubled teens to build a sense of responsibility. While attending Pasadena City College, he met the Van Halen brothers, Eddie and Alex. During this period, Roth worked as a hospital orderly.

==First run with Van Halen: 1972–1985==

In his late teens, Roth was singing solo, as well as with an R&amp;B-influenced rock band named the Red Ball Jets. Roth says the name was in reference to the red dye used in food at that time, including red candy balls, which would exacerbate his hyperactivity and lead to &quot;monkey hour&quot; at the family home. (Red Ball Jets was also the name of a brand of sneakers popular from 1951 to 1971.) Another Los Angeles band, Mammoth (featuring Alex Van Halen on drums and Eddie Van Halen singing and playing lead guitar), occasionally rented the Red Ball Jets&#x27; PA system for $10/night. After a couple of failed auditions, Roth joined Mammoth as lead singer. In 1974, Mammoth officially changed its name to Van Halen. According to Roth, this was his brainchild. He felt it was a moniker that offered long-term identity, aesthetic, and marketing advantages, like Santana.

Performing original and cover songs, Van Halen eventually gained success in the Pasadena, West Hollywood, and Los Angeles areas, becoming a regular feature on Sunset Strip clubs, such as Gazzarri&#x27;s, Myron&#x27;s, Whisky a Go Go, and the Starwood Club. In 1976, Gene Simmons took note of the band (in particular Eddie Van Halen, whom Simmons hoped to recruit for his own band, Kiss) and assisted them in producing a 10-track demo tape, featuring songs that would be included on their first two LPs and their 1984 album. The tape, however, did not attract much interest from major record labels. In early 1977, however, during their four-month stint at The Starwood, Warner Bros executive Mo Ostin and producer Ted Templeman signed them to an inauspicious two-album contract, one that heavily favored Warner Bros., offering but a .70 per unit royalty. Manager Noel Monk, then an equal partner in band revenue, renegotiated this rate for double in 1979. 

Released in 1978, the debut album &quot;Van Halen&quot; was recorded at Sunset Sound Recorders and immediately earned the band significant national attention and radio airplay. They toured for three months at the bottom of the bill supporting rising superstars Journey and Montrose (fronted by Sammy Hagar), then another nine months opening for heavy metal icons Black Sabbath. The album reached number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and eventually sold more than 12 million copies by 2014, certified Diamond by the RIAA.

Van Halen recorded four more platinum-selling albums over the next five years, often within 12 to 14 days and immediately returning to the road to tour. Roth is often credited with promoting Van Halen&#x27;s image, described by David Fricke in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a nonstop booze-and-babes party train.&quot; Yet despite this &#x27;wildman&#x27; image, Roth was key to the band&#x27;s success not just as a high kicking, tight pantsed, Capezio-wearing singer and lyricist, but as the de facto chairman of the board in band decisions of business, marketing and publicity, according to Monk. Roth&#x27;s sexy, macho but poetic, often jovial lyrics worked in perfect harmony with the hard rock guitar sounds composed by Eddie Van Halen; a sound-style that helped the band rise to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart in 1984, with their album &quot;1984&quot;, their first and only #1 LP. Looking back at Roth&#x27;s tenure, Fricke dubbed Van Halen as &quot;the monster rock action squad that ruled the charts and the airwaves for seven years.&quot; &quot;I remember hearing about this new band, Van Halen with David Lee Roth,&quot; recalled Aerosmith front-man Steven Tyler. &quot;&#x27;Who does this fucking guy think he is? He&#x27;s standing in my limelight.&#x27; I&#x27;d fucked myself up royally.&quot;

Despite the band&#x27;s seven-year financial and artistic success, a creative rift developed between Roth and Eddie Van Halen early on. Roth was interested in popularity via original or even cover songs about partying, dancing, women and sex, along the lines of Aerosmith, AC/DC or even disco, while Eddie wanted darker, deeper tunes in minor keys, like those on their 4th LP &quot;Fair Warning&quot;. They had been artistic foils on the first three albums, but their fifth LP, &quot;Diver Down&quot;, saw a disgruntled Edward &quot;sacrificing&quot; his original synthesizer and guitar riffs to five cover songs, three of which became singles: &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot;, &quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone&quot; and &quot;(Oh) Pretty Woman&quot;.
In 1983, Eddie designed and constructed a state-of-the-art recording studio in his home with the band&#x27;s recording engineer, Don Landee. This led to creative conflict, as it allowed Ed to dominate the recording process without as much input from Roth. Furthermore, he began to experiment in an almost New Wave direction with keyboards and synthesizers, while Roth preferred guitar-heavy hard rock. Their sixth and final album together until 2006, &quot;1984,&quot; was a critical and commercial success and continued the band&#x27;s move toward mainstream pop music.

In early 1985, while still a member of Van Halen, Roth released &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot;, an eclectic solo EP of off-beat pop standards. Some months before Roth&#x27;s departure, Noel Monk, their manager of seven years was fired suddenly by the Van Halen brothers; he speculated that (Roth) was testing the waters for a potential separate, solo career.

According to Monk, Roth formally parted ways with his Van Halen bandmates in August 1985 (although an urban legend persists that it was April 1, April Fool&#x27;s Day), taking with him 60 Van Halen employees, including VH Head of Security, Ed Andersen. In his 1997 autobiography, &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot;, a bitter Roth characterized Van Halen&#x27;s music just before his 1985 departure as &quot;morose&quot;.

===1996 reunion===
In June 1996, Roth briefly reunited with Van Halen, to great public fanfare. He recorded two new songs for Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Best Of – Volume I&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get This Stuff No More&quot; and &quot;Me Wise Magic&quot;. After an infamous appearance on September 5, 1996, at the MTV Video Music Awards during which Roth and Eddie Van Halen reportedly threatened each other, Roth was passed over for Van Halen&#x27;s vocalist job in favor of Gary Cherone. In 2012, Cherone confirmed the longtime rumor that he had already been chosen long before the MTV incident, suggesting that Van Halen used Roth to create public interest in the hits collection. &quot;Me Wise Magic&quot;, Van Halen&#x27;s display of psychedelia-influenced rock with Roth on vocals, became a No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock hit in 1996.

===2001 reunion===
In 2001, rumors circulated that Roth and the members of Van Halen had recorded several new songs together and were attempting yet another reunion. Roth and bassist Michael Anthony later confirmed that information, but nothing came of the music. The demos recorded at the sessions would be reworked in 2012&#x27;s &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot;, but with Wolfgang Van Halen replacing Anthony. A rumored box set did not materialize. Instead, Warner Bros. issued remastered versions of all six early Van Halen studio albums.

==Solo career: 1985–2006==

=== Commercial success: 1985–1991 ===

In 1984, Roth wished to record a solo EP quickly and shoot a film. &quot;We&#x27;ve created a whole retinue of characters,&quot; he noted of his vision with Angelus. &quot;It&#x27;s a genuine film. It&#x27;s not &#x27;Dave Singing&#x27; or &#x27;Elvis&#x27;.&quot; Entitled &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot;, the EP was released in January 1985, while the film was budgeted at $20 million by CBS Films; however, the project folded after the consolidation of CBS Studios.

In late 1985, now separated from Van Halen, Roth assembled a virtuoso supergroup, consisting of guitarist Steve Vai (previously of Frank Zappa&#x27;s band), bassist Billy Sheehan (previously of Talas), and drummer Gregg Bissonette (previously of Maynard Ferguson&#x27;s big band). With veteran Van Halen producer Ted Templeman producing, Roth released his debut solo LP, &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot; in July 1986. The album saw Roth&#x27;s return to hard rock music, but incorporated some of his eclectic musical tastes, including a jazz cover of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; and the bluesy, 1960s hit &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot; met with widespread commercial and critical success, charting at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200, selling over 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. Roth and his band toured arenas extensively in support of &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot; before returning to the studio in 1987 to record a follow-up album.

In January 1988, Roth released &quot;Skyscraper&quot;, a more experimental LP featuring the hit single &quot;Just Like Paradise&quot;. Co-produced by Roth and Steve Vai under the working title &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, &quot;Skyscraper&quot; peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart and ultimately sold two million copies in the US. Soon after &quot;Skyscraper&quot;″s release, Sheehan left Roth&#x27;s band due to musical differences. He was replaced in time for the album&#x27;s support tour with bassist Matt Bissonette (drummer Gregg Bissonette&#x27;s brother). The international Skyscraper Tour arena was a major production featuring, at different points during each concert, Roth surfing above the audience on a surfboard suspended from an arena&#x27;s rafters, and lowered into the center of each arena in a descending boxing ring. Both parts of the stage show were featured in the &quot;Just Like Paradise&quot; music video. The show also featured the band in a calypso segment playing Caribbean steel drums and in an unplugged segment where the band performed acoustic covers of old rock and roll songs. Following the tour for &quot;Skyscraper&quot;, Vai left Roth&#x27;s band to pursue a solo career and record and tour with Whitesnake.

Roth hired 19-year-old guitar virtuoso Jason Becker to replace Vai prior to recording his third solo LP, &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot; in 1991. A hard rock album produced by Bob Rock, &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot; achieved RIAA gold status shortly after its January 1991 release. Before starting a support tour for &quot;A Little Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;, Becker was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease, rendering him unable to perform onstage. Guitarist Joe Holmes stood in for Becker during the tour. Later in 1991, Nirvana and grunge rock emerged, altering popular tastes and suddenly making Roth&#x27;s brand of hard rock seem unfashionable. Roth&#x27;s band fractured shortly following the tour&#x27;s completion.

=== Commercial decline: 1992–2003 ===
In April 1993, Roth was arrested in New York City&#x27;s Washington Square Park for buying what he described as &quot;$10 worth of Jamaican bunk reefer&quot; from an undercover police officer. The arrest made headlines and became a late-night television punch-line. When asked by Howard Stern whether the bust was a publicity stunt, Roth said, &quot;Howard, in New York City this small of a bust is a $35 traffic citation. It literally says &#x27;Buick, Chevy, Other&#x27;. Your dog poops on the sidewalk, it&#x27;s $50. If I was looking for publicity, I would have pooped on the sidewalk.&quot;

In March 1994, Roth released &quot;Your Filthy Little Mouth&quot;, a musically-eclectic album produced by Nile Rodgers. The album failed to achieve significant critical or commercial success, proving to be Roth&#x27;s first solo effort not to achieve RIAA Gold or Platinum status shortly after its release. Roth played smaller venues in the U.S., and larger venues in Europe on a support tour.

In 1995, Roth returned with an adult lounge act, performing largely in Las Vegas casinos, with a brass band that featured Nile Rodgers, Edgar Winter, and members of the Miami Sound Machine. It also featured several exotic dancers, who in Roth&#x27;s words were &quot;so sweet, I bet they shit sugar!&quot; In 1997, Roth wrote a memoir, &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot;. The 359-page book was a selected collection of 1,200 pages of monologues, which were recorded and transcribed by a Princeton University graduate who followed Roth for almost a year. Henry Rollins is said to have worked on the memoir.

In 1998, Roth released &quot;DLR Band&quot;, another album of original material. The album featured a popular song, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, which, like a majority of the album, was co-written by rising guitarist and longtime Roth fan, John 5. The album was considered a return to form for Roth by critics. In 1999, Roth contacted the Songs of Love Foundation asking if he would be able to sing a song for an ailing child. He went on to record a &quot;Song of Love&quot; for 9-year-old Ashley Abernathy who was battling leukemia, which was released publicly many years later. In the late 1990s, Roth became an emergency medical technician (EMT) in New York City, going on over 200 ambulance rides. Roth&#x27;s EMT training was largely handled by Linda Reissman, who detailed this on an episode of &quot;The DLR Cast&quot; podcast.

In 2002, The &quot;Song for Song: The Heavyweight Champions of Rock and Roll Tour&quot; paired Roth with his &#x27;nemesis&#x27; Sammy Hagar, and it proceeded to revive the career of Roth. Despite the monetary success and publicity generated by the tour, Roth&#x27;s future with Van Halen seemed uncertain. &quot;Yankee Rose&quot; appeared in the 2002 videogame &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, playing on rock station V-Rock, while generally, Roth became more visible than he had been in years, such as appearing on commercials for MTV with Justin Timberlake. In 2003, Roth released an album called &quot;Diamond Dave&quot;, which included one original John 5 collaboration among numerous cover songs.

=== Other ventures: 2004–2006 ===
In 2004, Roth appeared on the TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as a poker-playing guest of Tony Soprano. Regarding this, Roth was quoted on his website as saying, &quot;Mom says I&#x27;m going to look like Lee Marvin in 10 years whether I&#x27;m in movies or not, so I might as well get after it!&quot; On July 4, 2004, Roth performed with the world-renowned Boston Pops Orchestra at Boston&#x27;s annual &quot;Pops Goes the Fourth&quot; celebration. The performance was witnessed by over 100,000 people live in Boston, and by millions more on US television. In 2006, Roth covered two Van Halen songs for an album titled &quot;Strummin&#x27; with the Devil&quot;, a tribute to his old band in bluegrass style. The album topped out at 66 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts.

In 2006, Roth was tapped to replace his friend Howard Stern on terrestrial radio, following Stern&#x27;s departure from terrestrial to Sirius Satellite Radio. Roth&#x27;s show lasted for four months and ended in a lawsuit. During the course of the show, Roth maintained a relationship with Howard 100 News reporter Steve Langford. Roth and Langford met frequently after shows, with Langford bringing tape back to Stern of Roth&#x27;s complaints towards WXRK&#x27;s management. Issues included Roth&#x27;s firing, the missing podcast, and his show being cut off early. On Roth&#x27;s final day, April 21, 2006, he performed the Rolling Stones song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; for Stern and discussed an impending lawsuit against CBS.

Later, on October 14, 2012, Roth began broadcasting a video webcast/podcast on his YouTube channel, Spotify and iTunes.

==Return to Van Halen: 2007–2015==

On January 24, 2007, after much anticipation, Billboard.com reported that Roth would rejoin Van Halen for a 40-date arena and amphitheater tour in mid-2007. This report, among many others, was confirmed with an official press release posted on the official Van Halen website on February 2, 2007.

On February 2, 2007, the official Van Halen website released information that Roth had rejoined the band along with current members Alex, Eddie, and Valerie Bertinelli&#x27;s and Eddie&#x27;s teenage son, Wolfgang Van Halen. On March 8 the official Van Halen website posted a letter from Eddie Van Halen stating that he did not feel he could perform his absolute best, and the tour with Roth would be postponed.

In March 2007 five members of Van Halen (the four original members and Sammy Hagar) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Van Halen brothers did not attend due to Eddie&#x27;s condition. Roth was to perform with the band Velvet Revolver; however, conflict with the band caused his part to be canceled. Roth subsequently did not attend the induction, leaving only Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar to represent Van Halen. Both Anthony and Hagar thanked Roth publicly for his contribution to the band during the awards acceptance. Roth did not attend the ceremony and the event was considered yet another public embarrassment for the band. The conflict was rumored to be based on song selection. Roth wanted to perform &quot;Jump&quot;, the band&#x27;s highest-charting song, but Velvet Revolver would only agree to play &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Love&quot; or &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;. When it was finally agreed upon that Paul Shaffer would perform &quot;Jump&quot;, Roth claimed there was no longer enough time to rehearse and opted not to attend the ceremony.

On August 13, 2007, six months after the initial reunion tour was postponed, it was finally confirmed by Van Halen with Roth at a press conference in Los Angeles that they would start the tour again in September 2007. At that conference, Eddie Van Halen stated that he and Roth were &quot;like brothers&quot; now. Calling Van Halen a &quot;real band&quot;, both Van Halen and Roth spoke of the possibility of further worldwide touring and a new album in mind for the future.

On June 5, 2008, Van Halen announced that the 2007–2008 tour with Roth grossed more than $93 million, a record for the rock band. Van Halen played to nearly one million people during 74 arena shows throughout the United States and Canada, beginning September 27, 2007, in Charlotte, North Carolina, and wrapping June 3, 2008, in Quebec City, QC, for the 400th anniversary of the city.

In December 2011, Van Halen announced a 2012 tour with Roth. The new Roth-fronted Van Halen album &quot;A Different Kind of Truth&quot; was released on February 7, 2012, and a tour commenced that month.

In March 2015, a new live album was released, &quot;Tokyo Dome Live in Concert&quot;, recorded in June 2013 during the A Different Kind of Truth Tour. That same month, the band made its first foray into American television by appearing on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, announcing a new tour in the process.

Van Halen disbanded after Eddie&#x27;s death from cancer on October 6, 2020.

== Later years: 2016–present ==
In 2014, Roth had recorded sessions with John 5 on guitar. Roth confirmed in October 2019 the album will soon be released now that he can start making &quot;real plans&quot; without Van Halen. In 2019 Roth announced a nine-date solo residency at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino House of Blues in 2020, with shows scheduled for January 8, 10 and 11 and March 18, 20, 21, 25, 27 and 28. He also went on an American tour with the band Kiss, playing 43 cities as the opening act. While Roth did complete some of the dates, the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. In August 2020, Kiss announced on their website that the tour would commence with Dave and his band opening on some dates. However, by August 2021, the band dropped Roth from their tour, with bassist/vocalist Gene Simmons referring to him as being &quot;past his prime.&quot;

In October 2020, Roth paid tribute to his late bandmate Eddie Van Halen by sharing his track &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow Bar and Grill,&quot; from the 2014 sessions. It was the first of five singles from the sessions released between late-2020 and early-2022.

In October 2021, Roth announced his intentions to retire from performing following a final residency set at the House of Blues Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas from December 2021 to January 2022. Following the cancellation of all shows, Roth retired from performing, with a March 2020 performance in Texas with Kiss being his final performance.

Following his retirement from performing, and the five original singles, Roth proceeded to release a series of covers of Van Halen songs throughout the second half of 2022.

==Personal life==
Roth has never married. He dated actress Apollonia Kotero in the 1980s. In a 2013 interview, he said he had four great loves in his life, but would not name them out of respect for his privacy. He said during the 20 years of Van Halen, he &quot;slept with every pretty girl with two legs.&quot;

In 2018, Roth and tattoo artist Ami James created INK the Original, which was a line of skincare products designed to protect tattooed skin. Roth spent more than 300 hours getting tattooed in Japan between 2013 and 2014, and noticed the body art market was expanding. After investing more than $7,000,000 in the company, and countless hours, the business closed in March 2022 for reasons not stated.

Roth maintains residences in Los Angeles, New York City and Tokyo. In 2004, he trained as a state-licensed emergency medical technician in New York. In 2012 he said, &quot;I probably have over 200 9-1-1 calls on my ticket in the last six years alone. I live a very different life away from music.&quot; He is a martial artist, has been training in kenjutsu since he was twelve years old, and also practices kenpō and Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Since 2006, Roth is a licensed private pilot for rotorcraft-helicopter.

Roth is a visual artist working in painting and drawings with a theme of social commentary.

<text>Mantineia (also Mantinea ; ; also Koine Greek &quot;Antigoneia&quot;) was a city in ancient Arcadia, Greece, which was the site of two significant battles in Classical Greek history.

In modern times it is a former municipality in Arcadia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Tripoli, of which it is a municipal unit. Its seat was the village of Nestani (pop. 486 in 2011). It is located in the northeastern part of Arcadia. The municipal unit has a land area of 205.393 km2 and a population of 1,693 inhabitants (2021). Its largest other towns are Artemisio, Loukas, and Kapsas.

==History==

The city emerged from the amalgamation of several neighbouring villages around 500 BC. Its patron god was Poseidon. It was a large city with numerous temples. The fortifications originally were polygonal. The temple of Artemis Hymnia, just on the north of the city, is mentioned by Pausanias. Diotima, who influenced Socrates, supposedly was a priestess there. Near the city was the dam of Mantineia, one of the most advanced examples of ancient technology.

The city was the place of the First Battle of Mantineia, in 418 BC, the largest land battle of the Peloponnesian War. On one side were Sparta and its remaining allies, and on the other were Athens, its allies, plus the cities that had revolted against the Spartans. After the Athenians&#x27; commander, Laches, was killed, the battle turned into a rout of the Athenian and allied armies, a result attributed to greater Spartan courage.

Mantineia had been a member of the Peloponnesian League, but during the Peloponnesian War, the city joined Athens. After the war, it was forced to rejoin the Peloponnese. Later, Sparta used the Peace of Antalcidas (387 BC) as a pretext to break Mantineia into its constituent villages. In response, the Mantineans expelled pro-Spartans from the city, but were vanquished in the Siege of Mantinea (385 BC), and the city was dismembered and destroyed. After the Spartan defeat at the end of the Theban–Spartan War, Mantineia re-formed into a single city. The fortifications now became almost oval, keeping some parts of the old walls.

The Second Battle of Mantinea, in 362 BC, led to the fall of Theban hegemony. In that battle, Athens and Sparta were allied. Thebes won the battle, but its greatest general, Epaminondas, was killed in the fighting.

Macedonian king Antigonus III Doson sacked the city at 223 BC. Antigonus handed the city to the Achaeans, which colonized it, under Aratus of Sicyon, and renamed the city to Antigonia.

Roman emperor Hadrian restored Mantineia&#x27;s name. In 130 AD he visited the city and built a temple dedicated to his lover Antinous.
Some decades later, probably few years before 166 AD, Pausanias visited the area and described the ruins and remains of the city at the time in his 8th book.

Modern-day Mantineia is the region around the city of Tripoli in Arcadia, and was named after the namesake city of old. It is also the name of a Protected designation of origin of Greek blanc de gris wine, made of the moschofilero grape traditionally grown in the region. The seat of Mantineia is Nestani, home to about one-fifth (20%) of the population.

Mountains surround the valley, including the Lyrkeia mountains as well as the Mainalo mountains to the southwest. The valley consists of vineyards, potato and wheat farms, as well as other crops, and covers about half of the municipality. Several floods ravaged Mantineia in the mid-20th century, even to the extent of forming a lake that has since been drained. Forests dominate the mountains. Rocks and grasslands cover most of the northeast.

The Mantineia Marble, dated to the 4th century BC and now exhibited at National Archaeological Museum of Athens, depicts the mythical contest between Apollo and Marsyas, with a Greek pandouris being played by a muse seated on a rock. This is important to researchers into the history of musical instruments. Lutes have been present in ancient Greece

==Democracy in Mantineia==
There was a democracy in place in Mantineia by 420 BC, when Thucydides says that the Mantineans joined an alliance led by Argos because it was a fellow democracy. Aristotle describes an unusual feature of the Mantinean system: officials were elected, not by the people as a whole, but by a special committee selected by the people. For this committee to be selected, the people had to attend an Assembly of sorts, probably once a year, and there was also a Council, like in other Greek democracies. Officials included &quot;damiourgoi&quot; (a political role) as well as &quot;theoroi&quot; (a religious one) and &quot;polemarchoi&quot; (military). In 385 the Spartans forcibly suppressed the democracy, though it did have a brief revival in the 360s when Mantineia was part of the Arcadian League.

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit Mantineia is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets):
*Artemisio 
*Kapsas 
*Loukas (Loukas, Milia)
*Nestani (Nestani, Milea, Gorgoepikoos Monastery)
*Pikernis
*Sanga 
*Simiades (Simiades, Neos Kardaras)

==Province==
The province of Mantineia () was one of the provinces of the Arcadia Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Tripoli. Its seat was the town of Tripoli. It was abolished in 2006.

==Historical population==

== Folk music ==
Mantineian folk music mainly consists of the songs with meters 6/4, 4/4 and 7/8.These meters are often the building blocks of the Mantineian folk dances: Tsamiko, Syrto, and Kalamatiano respectively. The meter 7/8, is the most common meter found in the province.

=== Types of folk songs ===

==== Klephtic Songs ====
Klephtic songs are about a historical event and the hardships specific villages went through. Klephtic songs are free-meter songs and they can be in chromatic or/and diatonic modes.

==== Wedding songs ====
Wedding songs can differ from village to village and the major steps of weddings are followed by music: &quot;Patinadha&quot; is played with daouli and karamoutza announcing the time for the ceremony to the village, &quot;My Venetian Padlock&quot; sang by the bride when her dowry is displayed after the wedding, when going to her future home, a Kandhylian melody is being played, and at the reception &quot;Sitting at this Wedding Table&quot; is sung by the priest for blessing.

==== Road songs ====
Road songs gets its name from the occasion they were sung, which was on the road by the workers who were going back to their home. Unlike Wedding songs, road songs are not different in each village, instead, the dances for the songs do differ with either a Syrto or Kalamatiano. Road songs usually are happy songs that talk about love and nature.

==== Laments or Mirologhia songs ====
Laments are sung often by widows, only women, and include positive thoughts about the deceased in the province of Mantinea. There is not much of a recording of laments since it is believed to bring death to a loved one of the person who sang it without a reason.
=== Folk musical instruments ===
There were many musical instruments in ancient Greece, however, daouli and karamoutza are the most common instruments existed in the villages of the province Mantineia. Some regions similar to Chrisovitsi, didn&#x27;t have these folk instruments. The folk music of Chrisovitsi mostly consisted of vocal songs and the instrument floghera. With the tradition of dance songs sang by the lead dancer in Chrisovitsi, there is no evidence of existence of any folk instruments.

== Notable people==
*Demonax, lawgiver (6th century BC)
*Nicodorus, lawgiver (5th century BC)
*Diotima, a female philosopher identified in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;
*Lastheneia, a female philosopher and student of Plato

<doc id="264326" wikidata="Q381611" url="?curid=264326" title="Aeroperú">
<text>Empresa de Transporte Aéreo del Perú S.A. branded as Aeroperú, was a Peruvian airline, serving as flag carrier of Peru from 1973 to 1999. The company was headquartered in Lima, with the city&#x27;s Jorge Chávez International Airport serving as its primary hub. Besides an extensive domestic route network, Aeroperú offered international flights to places in Latin America and the United States of America. The company had around 1,500 employees. It ceased operations in 1999, with LAN Perú being its successor as flag carrier.

==History==

Aeroperú was formed on May 22, 1973, following the reorganization of SATCO, an earlier airline founded on 1960 and controlled by the Peruvian Army. Initially, a wholly state-owned company with a fleet of three Fokker F28 Fellowships taken over from SATCO, revenue flights were commenced in October on the Lima-Cusco route. Soon, a Boeing 727 joined the fleet, and the airline placed an order for two new Fokker F27 Friendships. In 1974, two Douglas DC-8s were acquired from Viasa, which allowed the company to launch international flights. 

The inaugural international flight to Buenos Aires took place on 29 July 1974, soon followed by a scheduled service to Miami. By 1978, the Aeroperú network had grown to include many Latin American destinations, and also the US cities of New York and Los Angeles due to their large Latino populations.
In July 1981, Aeroperú was gradually privatized, with the Peruvian government keeping a 20% minority share. In 1982, plans were made for a merger with Faucett Perú, the other large Peruvian passenger airline at that time. As a preparatory measure, redundancies in the route networks of the two airlines were eliminated, to which end Aeroperú suspended flights to a number of destinations, including Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, New York City and Los Angeles. No further steps were taken towards merging the two airlines, and so in 1983 flights to several destinations recommenced. A bilateral air traffic agreement between Peru and the United States expired on 11 November 1983. Because of disagreements over the granting of fifth freedom rights, all flights between the two countries were suspended in May 1984 until mid-1985, which affected Aeroperú&#x27;s Lima-Miami route.
In 1993, Aeroméxico acquired 70% of the shares worth $54 million, thus making Aeroperú its subsidiary. Subsequently, two Boeing 757-200s were transferred, allowing Aeroperú to replace their ageing DC-8s. In 1996, 47% of Aeroperú was transferred to Cintra, the parent company of Aeroméxico and Mexicana de Aviación. In 1998, Delta Air Lines became a major shareholder of Aeroperú, when they acquired a 35% stake in the airline. The agreement saw Cintra reducing their share to an equal 35%.

Aeroperú was forced to suspend all flight operations on March 10, 1999. According to general director Jaan Albrecht, Aeroperu&#x27;s debt by 1999 had reached $174 million, while the airline&#x27;s tangible assets were worth only $50 million. Several plans for a relaunch were made, which included a possible buy-in of Continental Airlines or a takeover by a group of foreign investors. None of these materialized, and Aeroperú was liquidated on August 18, 1999. Most of its route network as well as the role of Peruvian flag carrier was taken over by newly founded LAN Perú.

==Destinations==
With Jorge Chavez International Airport being its most important hub, Aeroperú maintained an extensive domestic route network. International flights were offered to a number of cities in Latin America, as well as the United States.

==Fleet==
Over the years, Aeroperú operated the following aircraft types:

==Accidents and incidents==
* On October 25, 1988, in Aeroperú Flight 772, a Fokker F28 Fellowship (registered OB-R-1020) took off at Inca Manco Cápac International Airport for a domestic flight to Arequipa, but failed to obtain any substantial height. Subsequently, the aircraft hit the ground and broke up. 11 of the 65 passengers on board were killed, as well as one crew member.
* On October 2, 1996, at 01:11 local time, Aeroperú Flight 603, a Boeing 757-200 (registered N52AW) was en route from Lima to Santiago de Chile when it crashed into the Pacific Ocean. All 70 people on board died in the crash. Investigators revealed that during earlier maintenance work, a protective tape covering the static ports of the airplane had not been removed, which resulted in incorrect instrument data being delivered to the pilots during the accident flight.

<text>Warren Earl Burger (September 17, 1907 – June 25, 1995) was an American attorney who served as the 15th chief justice of the United States from 1969 to 1986.

Born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Burger graduated from the St. Paul College of Law in 1931. He helped secure the Minnesota delegation&#x27;s support for Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1952 Republican National Convention. After Eisenhower won the 1952 presidential election, he appointed Burger to the position of Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division. In 1956, Eisenhower appointed Burger to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Burger served on this court until 1969 and became known as a critic of the Warren Court.

In 1969, President Richard Nixon nominated Burger to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice, and Burger won Senate confirmation with little opposition. He did not emerge as a strong intellectual force on the Court, but sought to improve the administration of the federal judiciary. He also helped establish the National Center for State Courts and the Supreme Court Historical Society. Burger remained on the Court until his retirement in 1986, when he became Chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. He was succeeded as Chief Justice by William H. Rehnquist, who had served as an associate justice since 1972.

In 1974, Burger wrote for a unanimous court in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;, which rejected Nixon&#x27;s invocation of executive privilege in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The ruling played a major role in Nixon&#x27;s resignation. Burger joined the majority in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in holding that the right to privacy prohibited states from banning abortions. Later analyses have suggested that Burger joined the majority in &quot;Roe&quot; solely to prevent Justice William O. Douglas from controlling assignment of the opinion. On the contrary, Burger would vote with the majority in &quot;Harris v. McRae&quot; in 1980, which formally launched the Hyde Amendment into effect. He later abandoned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in &quot;Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&quot;. His majority opinion in &quot;INS v. Chadha&quot; struck down the one-house legislative veto.

Although Burger was nominated by a conservative president, the Burger Court also delivered some of the most liberal decisions regarding abortion, capital punishment, religious establishment, sex discrimination, and school desegregation during his tenure.

==Early life==

Burger was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1907, as one of seven children. His parents, Katharine (née Schnittger) and Charles Joseph Burger, a traveling salesman and railroad cargo inspector, were of Austrian German descent. He was raised Presbyterian. His grandfather, Joseph Burger, was born in Bludenz, Vorarlberg, had emigrated from Tyrol, Austria and joined the Union Army when he was 13. Joseph Burger fought and was wounded in the Civil War, resulting in the loss of his right arm and was awarded the Medal of Honor at the age of 14. At age 16, Joseph Burger became one of the youngest captains in the Union Army and would go on to become a member of the Minnesota state legislature.

Burger grew up on the family farm near the edge of Saint Paul. At age 8, he stayed home from school for a year after contracting polio. Burger attended the same grade school as future Associate Justice Harry Blackmun. He attended John A. Johnson High School, where he was president of the student council. He competed in hockey, football, track, and swimming. While in high school, he wrote articles on high school sports for local newspapers. He graduated in 1925, and received a partial scholarship to attend Princeton University, which he declined because his family&#x27;s finances were not sufficient to cover the remainder of his expenses.

That same year, Burger also worked with the crew building the Robert Street Bridge, a crossing of the Mississippi River in Saint Paul that still exists. Concerned about the number of deaths on the project, he asked that a net be installed to catch anyone who fell, but was rebuffed by managers. In later years, Burger made a point of visiting the bridge whenever he came back to town.

==Education and early career==

Burger enrolled in extension classes at the University of Minnesota for two years while selling insurance for Mutual Life Insurance. Afterward, he enrolled at St. Paul College of Law (which later became William Mitchell College of Law, now Mitchell Hamline School of Law), receiving his Bachelor of Laws, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, in 1931. He took a job at a St. Paul law firm. In 1937, Burger served as the eighth president of the Saint Paul Jaycees. He also taught for twenty-two years at William Mitchell. A spinal condition prevented Burger from serving in the military during World War II; instead he supported the war effort at home, including service on Minnesota&#x27;s emergency war labor board from 1942 to 1947. From 1948 to 1953, he served on the governor of Minnesota&#x27;s interracial commission, which worked on issues related to racial desegregation. He also served as president of St. Paul&#x27;s Council on Human Relations, which considered ways to improve the relationship between the city&#x27;s police department and its minority residents.

Burger&#x27;s political career began uneventfully, but he soon rose to national prominence. He supported Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen&#x27;s unsuccessful pursuit of the Republican nomination for president in 1948. At the 1952 Republican National Convention, Burger played a key role in Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s nomination by leading the Minnesota delegates to change their votes from Stassen to Eisenhower after Stassen failed to obtain 10 percent of the vote, which freed the Minnesota delegation from their pledge to support him.

==Assistant Attorney General==

President Eisenhower appointed Burger as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division of the Justice Department.

In this role, he first argued in front of the Supreme Court. The case involved John P. Peters, a Yale University professor who worked as a consultant to the government. He had been discharged from his position on loyalty grounds. Supreme Court cases are usually argued by the Solicitor General, but he disagreed with the government&#x27;s position and refused to argue the case. Burger lost the case. Shortly after, in &quot;Dalehite v. United States&quot;, 346 U.S. 15 (1953), Burger defended the United States against claims from the Texas City ship explosion disaster, successfully arguing that the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1947 did not allow a suit for negligence in policy making.

==Court of Appeals service==

Burger was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 12, 1956, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated by Judge Harold M. Stephens. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 28, 1956, and received his commission on March 29, 1956. His service terminated on June 23, 1969, due to his elevation to the United States Supreme Court.

==Chief Justice==
===Nomination and confirmation===
In June 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced his retirement, effective on the confirmation of his successor. President Lyndon Johnson nominated sitting associate justice Abe Fortas to the position, but a Senate filibuster blocked his confirmation, and Johnson withdrew the nomination. Richard Nixon was elected president in November 1968 and Johnson did not make another nomination before his term as president ended on January 20, 1969.

Burger was nominated by President Nixon to succeed Earl Warren on May 23, 1969. The United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary hearing on Burger&#x27;s nomination took place on June 3, 1969. It was characterized as having been friendly, and saw Burger as the sole individual to deliver testimony. The hearing was reported as having taken only an hour and forty minutes. Afterwards, the committee held a five-minute private session in which they voted unanimously to report favorably on his nomination. The Senate confirmed Burger to the court by a 74–3 vote on June 9, 1969, and he took the judicial oath of office on June 23, 1969.

Remaking the Supreme Court had been a theme in Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign, and he had pledged to appoint a strict constructionist as Chief Justice. Burger had first caught Nixon&#x27;s eye through a letter of support he sent to Nixon during the 1952 Fund crisis, and then again 15 years later when the magazine &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; reprinted a 1967 speech that Burger had given at Ripon College. In it, Burger compared the United States judicial system to those of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark:

Through speeches like this, Burger became known as a critic of Chief Justice Warren and an advocate of a literal, strict-constructionist reading of the U.S. Constitution. Nixon&#x27;s agreement with these views, being expressed by a readily confirmable, sitting federal appellate judge, led to the nomination.

According to President Nixon&#x27;s memoirs, he had asked Burger in the spring of 1970 to be prepared to run for president in 1972 if the political repercussions of the Cambodia invasion were too negative for him to endure. A few years later, Burger was on Nixon&#x27;s short list of vice presidential candidates following the resignation of Spiro Agnew in October 1973, before Gerald Ford was appointed to succeed him.

===Jurisprudence===
The Court issued a unanimous ruling, &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; (1971), supporting busing to reduce &quot;de facto&quot; racial segregation in schools. However, Burger wrote the majority opinion for &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; (1974), which upheld &quot;de facto&quot; school segregation across school district lines if segregationist policy was not explicitly stated by all of the districts involved. In &quot;United States v. U.S. District Court&quot; (1972), the Burger Court issued another unanimous ruling against the Nixon administration&#x27;s desire to invalidate the need for a search warrant and the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in cases of domestic surveillance. Then, only two weeks later in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972), the Court, in a 5–4 decision, invalidated all death penalty laws then in force although Burger dissented from that decision. In the most controversial ruling of his term, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973), Burger voted with the majority to recognize a broad right to privacy that prohibited states from banning abortions. However, Burger later abandoned &quot;Roe&quot; in &quot;Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&quot; (1986).

On July 24, 1974, Burger led the Court in a unanimous decision in &quot;United States v. Nixon&quot;, arising from Nixon&#x27;s attempt to keep several memos and tapes relating to the Watergate scandal private. As documented in Woodward and Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;The Brethren&quot; and elsewhere, Burger&#x27;s original feelings on the case were that Watergate was merely a political battle, and Burger &quot;didn&#x27;t see what they did wrong&quot;. The actual final opinion was largely Brennan&#x27;s work, but each justice wrote at least a rough draft of a particular section. Burger was originally to vote in favor of Nixon but tactically changed his vote to assign the opinion to himself and to restrain the opinion&#x27;s rhetoric. Burger&#x27;s first draft of the opinion wrote that executive privilege could be invoked when it dealt with a &quot;core function&quot; of the presidency and that in some cases, the executive could be supreme. However, the other justices were able to convince Burger to excise that language from the opinion: the judicial branch alone would have the power to determine whether something can be shielded under an assertion of executive privilege.

Burger joined the majority decision in &quot;Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley&quot;, which was the first special education law case decided by the Supreme Court. The Court upheld the constitutionality of Individual Education Plans, but also held that the school district did not have to provide every service necessary in order to maximize a child&#x27;s potential.

Burger also emphasized the maintenance of checks and balances among the branches of government. In &quot;Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha&quot; (1983), he held for the majority that Congress could not reserve a legislative veto over executive branch actions.

On issues involving criminal law and procedure, Burger remained reliably conservative. He dissented in &quot;Solem v. Helm&quot;, which held that a life sentence for a phony check was unconstitutional. He once stated personal opposition to the death penalty in his &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; dissent, but defended it as constitutional.

===Leadership===
Rather than dominating the Court, Burger sought to improve administration both within the Court and within the nation&#x27;s legal system. Criticizing some advocates as unprepared, Burger created training venues for state and local government advocates. He also helped found the National Center for State Courts, which is now in Williamsburg, Virginia, as well as the Institute for Court Management, and National Institute of Corrections to provide professional training for judges, clerks, and prison guards. Burger also began a tradition of annually delivering a &quot;State of the Judiciary&quot; speech to the American Bar Association, many of whose members had been alienated by the Warren Court. However, some detractors thought his emphasis on the mechanics of the judicial system trivialized the office of chief justice. Despite his reputation for being imperious, he was well-liked by the law clerks and judicial fellows who worked with him.

Burger drew internal controversy within the Supreme Court throughout his tenure, as was revealed in Woodward and Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;The Brethren&quot;. Although Sen. Everett Dirksen noted Burger &quot;looked, sounded, and acted like a chief justice,&quot; the reporters depicted Burger as an ineffective chief justice who was not seriously respected by his colleagues for his alleged pomposity and lack of legal acumen. Woodward and Armstrong&#x27;s sources indicated that some of the other justices were annoyed by Burger&#x27;s practice of switching his vote in conference or simply not announcing his vote so that he could control opinion assignments. &quot;Burger repeatedly irked his colleagues by changing his vote to remain in the majority, and by rewarding his friends with choice assignments and punishing his foes with dreary ones.&quot; Burger would also try to influence the course of events in a case by circulating a pre-emptive opinion. Clerks mocked him for his perceived egotism and intense homophobia, and Justice Lewis Powell allegedly referred to him as &quot;the great white doughnut&quot;, an attack on both his intellect and physical appearance.

Consequently, the Burger Court was described as his &quot;in name only&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called him &quot;plodding&quot; and &quot;standoffish&quot; as well as &quot;pompous&quot;, &quot;aloof&quot;, and unpopular. Burger was a constant irritant on the Court&#x27;s group dynamic, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Linda Greenhouse. Jeffrey Toobin wrote in his book &quot;The Nine&quot; that by the time of his departure in 1986, Burger had alienated all of his colleagues to one degree or another. In particular, Associate Justice Potter Stewart, who had been considered a candidate to succeed Warren as chief justice, was so discontented with Burger that he became the primary source for Woodward and Armstrong when they wrote &quot;The Brethren&quot;.

Greenhouse pointed to &quot;INS v. Chadha&quot; as evidence of Burger&#x27;s &quot;foundering leadership&quot;. Burger would cause the case to be delayed for over twenty months although there had been five votes to affirm the appeals court&#x27;s finding of unconstitutionality after the case had been first argued: Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Powell, and Stevens. Burger did not allow an opinion to be assigned, first by asking for a special conference on the case and then by delaying the case for reargument when that conference fell through even though he never held a formal vote on holding the case over for reargument.

===Views on women judges===
No women served on the Supreme Court until 1981, and Burger was strongly opposed to giving a seat to a female judge. In 1971, President Nixon considered nominating California state Appellate Judge Mildred Lillie to the Supreme Court. Former White House Counsel John Dean had said that the greatest opposition to Lillie came from Chief Justice Burger. Dean indicated that Burger threatened to resign over the nomination.

===Views on homosexuality===
Burger was deeply prejudiced against gay people to an extent which bordered on hysteria. Burger sent Byron White, who wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; upholding laws banning homosexual relations between consenting adults, a letter telling him to condemn homosexuality in his opinion. White refused. When Lewis Powell voted to strike down the anti-gay laws, Burger aggressively lobbied him to change his mind, and sent him a letter so hostile towards homosexuals that Powell mockingly described it as &quot;nonsense&quot;. Burger wrote his own opinion attacking homosexuality, quoting a description of it as &quot;an infamous crime against nature, of deeper malignity than rape, and an act not fit to be named, the very mention of which is an affront to human nature&quot;, and noted, with apparent approval, that homosexuals were once executed. Burger&#x27;s language mobilized gay rights advocates to work to overturn sodomy laws, eventually succeeding in the 2003 case &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;.

==Later life and death==
Burger left office on September 26, 1986, in part to lead the campaign to mark the bicentennial of the United States Constitution. He was succeeded as chief justice by William Rehnquist. He served longer than any other chief justice appointed in the 20th century.

In 1987, Princeton University&#x27;s American Whig-Cliosophic Society awarded Burger the James Madison Award for Distinguished Public Service. In 1988, he was awarded the prestigious United States Military Academy&#x27;s Sylvanus Thayer Award as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In a 1991 appearance on the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;, Burger stated that the notion that the Second Amendment guaranteed an unlimited individual right to obtain any kind of weapon &quot;has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word &#x27;fraud,&#x27; on the American public by special interest groups&quot;. 

On June 25, 1995, Burger died from congestive heart failure at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, at the age of 87. All of his papers were donated to the College of William and Mary, where he had served as Chancellor; however, they will not be open to the public until ten years after the death of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor in 2033-2034, the last surviving member of the Burger Court, per the donor agreement. O&#x27;Connor died on December 1, 2023.

Burger&#x27;s casket lay in repose in the Great Hall of the United States Supreme Court Building. His remains are interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==

As chief justice, Burger was instrumental in founding the Supreme Court Historical Society and was its first president. Burger is often cited as one of the foundational proponents of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), particularly in its ability to ameliorate an overloaded justice system. In a speech given in front of the American Bar Association, Chief Justice Burger lamented the state of the justice system in 1984, saying, &quot;Our system is too costly, too painful, too destructive, too inefficient for a truly civilized people. To rely on the adversary process as the principal means of resolving conflicting claims is a mistake that must be corrected.&quot; The Warren E. Burger Federal Courthouse in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and the Warren E. Burger Library at his alma mater, the Mitchell Hamline School of Law (formerly the William Mitchell College of Law, and the St. Paul College of Law at the time of Burger&#x27;s attendance) are named in his honor.

==Family and personal life==

He married Elvera Stromberg in 1933. They had two children, Wade Allen Burger (1936–2002) and Margaret Elizabeth Burger (1946–2017). Elvera Burger died at their home in Washington, D.C., on May 30, 1994, at the age of 86.

<text>William Ballard Doggett (February 16, 1916 – November 13, 1996) was an American pianist and organist. He began his career playing swing music before transitioning into rhythm and blues. Best known for his instrumental compositions &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; and &quot;Hippy Dippy&quot;, Doggett was a pioneer of rock and roll. He worked with the Ink Spots, Johnny Otis, Wynonie Harris, Ella Fitzgerald, and Louis Jordan.

==Biography==
Doggett was born in Philadelphia. During the 1930s and early 1940s he worked for Lucky Millinder, Frank Fairfax and arranger Jimmy Mundy. In 1942 he was hired as the Ink Spots&#x27; pianist and arranger.

In 1951, Doggett organized his own trio and began recording for King Records. His best known recording is &quot;Honky Tonk&quot;, a rhythm and blues hit of 1956, which sold four million copies (reaching No. 1 R&amp;B and No. 2 Pop), and which he co-wrote with Billy Butler. The track topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart for over two months. He also arranged for many bandleaders and performers, including Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, and Lionel Hampton.

He continued to play and arrange until he died, aged 80, from cancer in New York City.

<text>Radar astronomy is a technique of observing nearby astronomical objects by reflecting radio waves or microwaves off target objects and analyzing their reflections. Radar astronomy differs from &quot;radio astronomy&quot; in that the latter is a passive observation (i.e., receiving only) and the former an active one (transmitting and receiving). Radar systems have been conducted for six decades applied to a wide range of Solar System studies. The radar transmission may either be pulsed or continuous.
The strength of the radar return signal is proportional to the inverse fourth-power of the distance. Upgraded facilities, increased transceiver power, and improved apparatus have increased observational opportunities.

Radar techniques provide information unavailable by other means, such as testing general relativity by observing Mercury and providing a refined value for the astronomical unit. Radar images provide information about the shapes and surface properties of solid bodies, which cannot be obtained by other ground-based techniques.


Relying upon high-powered terrestrial radars (of up to one megawatt), radar astronomy is able to provide extremely accurate astrometric information on the structure, composition and movement of Solar System objects. This aids in forming long-term predictions of asteroid-Earth impacts, as illustrated by the object 99942 Apophis. In particular, optical observations measure where an object appears in the sky, but cannot measure the distance with great accuracy (relying on parallax becomes more difficult when objects are small or poorly illuminated). Radar, on the other hand, directly measures the distance to the object (and how fast it is changing). The combination of optical and radar observations normally allows the prediction of orbits at least decades, and sometimes centuries, into the future.

In August 2020 the Arecibo Observatory (Arecibo Planetary Radar) suffered a structural cable failure, leading to the collapse of the main telescope in December of that year.

As of 2023, there were two radar astronomy facilities in regular use, the Goldstone Solar System Radar and Evpatoria Planetary Radar.

== Advantages ==

* Control of attributes of the signal [i.e., the waveform&#x27;s time/frequency modulation and polarization]
* Resolve objects spatially.
* Delay-Doppler measurement precision.
* Optically opaque penetration.
* Sensitive to high concentrations of metal or ice.

== Disadvantages ==

The maximum range of astronomy by radar is very limited, and is confined to the Solar System. This is because the signal strength drops off very steeply with distance to the target, the small fraction of incident flux that is reflected by the target, and the limited strength of transmitters. The distance to which the radar can detect an object is proportional to the square root of the object&#x27;s size, due to the one-over-distance-to-the-fourth dependence of echo strength. Radar could detect something ~1 km across a large fraction of an AU away, but at 8-10 AU, the distance to Saturn, we need targets at least hundreds of kilometers wide. It is also necessary to have a relatively good ephemeris of the target before observing it.

== History ==
The Moon is comparatively close and was detected by radar soon after the invention of the technique in 1946. Measurements included surface roughness and later mapping of shadowed regions near the poles.

The next easiest target is Venus. This was a target of great scientific value, since it could provide an unambiguous way to measure the size of the astronomical unit, which was needed for the nascent field of interplanetary spacecraft. In addition such technical prowess had great public relations value, and was an excellent demonstration to funding agencies. So there was considerable pressure to squeeze a scientific result from weak and noisy data, which was accomplished by heavy post-processing of the results, utilizing the expected value to tell where to look. This led to early claims (from Lincoln Laboratory, Jodrell Bank, and Vladimir A. Kotelnikov of the USSR) which are now known to be incorrect. All of these agreed with each other and the conventional value of AU at the time, .

The first unambiguous detection of Venus was made by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on 10 March 1961. JPL established contact with the planet Venus using a planetary radar system from 10 March to 10 May 1961. Using both velocity and range data, a new value of was determined for the astronomical unit. Once the correct value was known, other groups found echos in their archived data that agreed with these results.

The Sun has been detected several times starting in 1959. Frequencies are usually between 25 and 38 MHz, much lower than for interplanetary work. Reflections from both the photosphere and the corona were detected.

The following is a list of planetary bodies that have been observed by this means:
* Mercury - Improved value for the distance from the earth observed (GR test). Rotational period, libration, surface mapping, esp. of polar regions.
* Venus - first radar detection in 1961. Rotation period, gross surface properties. The Magellan mission mapped the entire planet using a radar altimeter.
* Earth - numerous airborne and spacecraft radars have mapped the entire planet, for various purposes. One example is the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, which mapped large parts of the surface of Earth at 30 m resolution.
* Mars - Mapping of surface roughness from Arecibo Observatory. The Mars Express mission carries a ground-penetrating radar.
* Jupiter System - Galilean satellites
* Saturn System - Rings and Titan from Arecibo Observatory, mapping of Titan&#x27;s surface and observations of other moons from the Cassini spacecraft.


== Asteroids and comets ==

Radar provides the ability to study the shape, size and spin state of asteroids and comets from the ground. Radar imaging has produced images with up to 7.5-meter resolution. With sufficient data, the size, shape, spin and radar albedo of the target asteroids can be extracted.

Only 19 comets have been studied by radar, including 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann. There have been radar observations of 612 Near-Earth asteroids and 138 Main belt asteroids as of early 2016. By 2018, this had grown to 138 Main-Belt Asteroids, 789 Near-Earth Asteroids, also at that time 20 comets had been observed.

Many bodies are observed during their close flyby of Earth.

While operational the Arecibo Observatory provided information about Earth threatening comet and asteroid impacts, allowing impact and near miss predictions decades into the future such as those for Apophis and other bodies. Being smaller, the Goldstone Solar System Radar is less sensitive and unable to provide the same predictive capacity.

<text>Edward F. Davis (March 2, 1922 – November 3, 1986), known professionally as Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, was an American jazz tenor saxophonist.
It is unclear how he acquired the moniker &quot;Lockjaw&quot; (later shortened to &quot;Jaws&quot;): it is either said that it came from the title of a tune or from his way of biting hard on the saxophone mouthpiece. Other theories have been put forward.

==Biography==
Davis played with Cootie Williams, Lucky Millinder, Andy Kirk, Eddie Bonnemère, Louis Armstrong, and Count Basie, as well as leading his own bands and making many recordings as a leader. He played in the swing, bop, hard bop, Latin jazz, and soul jazz genres. Some of his recordings from the 1940s also could be classified as rhythm and blues.

In 1940, when Teddy Hill became the manager of the legendary Minton&#x27;s Jazz club, he put Eddie Davis in charge of deciding which musicians could, or couldn&#x27;t, sit in during the jam sessions (playing in this Minton&#x27;s sessions was coveted by many, including musicians which were not up to the demanding standards of the venue).

His 1946 band, Eddie Davis and His Beboppers, featured Fats Navarro, Al Haig, Huey Long, Gene Ramey and Denzil Best.

In the 1950s, he was playing with Sonny Stitt, while from 1960 to 1962, he and fellow tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin led a quintet.

Starting in 1955, and up to 1960, Eddie Davis pioneered the tenor sax/Hammond organ combo, in a group featuring Shirley Scott on the Hammond B3.

From the mid-1960s, Davis and Griffin also performed together as part of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band, along with other, mainly European, jazz musicians.

Davis died of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma in Culver City, California, at the age of 64.

<text>In chess, there are a number of ways that a game can end in a draw, in which neither player wins. Draws are codified by various rules of chess including stalemate (when the player to move is not in check but has no legal move), threefold repetition (when the same position occurs three times with the same player to move), and the fifty-move rule (when the last fifty successive moves made by both players contain no or pawn move). Under the standard FIDE rules, a draw also occurs in a &quot;dead position&quot; (when no sequence of legal moves can lead to checkmate), most commonly when neither player has sufficient to checkmate the opponent.

Unless specific tournament rules forbid it, players may agree to a draw at any time. Ethical considerations may make a draw uncustomary in situations where at least one player has a reasonable chance of winning. For example, a draw could be called after a move or two, but this would likely be thought unsporting.

In the 19th century, some tournaments, notably London 1883, required that drawn games be replayed; however, this was found to cause organizational problems due to the backlog. It is now standard practice to score a decisive game as one point to the winner, and a draw as a half point to each player.
==Draw rules==
The rules allow for several types of draws: stalemate, threefold or fivefold repetition of a position, if there has been no or a pawn being moved in the last fifty or seventy-five moves, if checkmate is impossible, or if the players agree to a draw. In games played under time control, a draw may result under additional conditions. A stalemate is an automatic draw, as is a draw due to impossibility of checkmate. A draw by threefold repetition or the fifty-move rule may be claimed by one of the players with the (normally using his ), and claiming it is optional. The draw by fivefold repetition or the seventy-five-move rule is mandatory by the arbiter.

A claim of a draw first counts as an offer of a draw, and the opponent may accept the draw without the arbiter examining the claim. Once a claim or draw offer has been made, it cannot be withdrawn. If the claim is verified or the draw offer accepted, the game is over. Otherwise, the offer or claim is nullified and the game continues; the draw offer is no longer in effect.

The correct procedure for an offer of a draw is to first make a move, verbally offer the draw, then press the clock. The other player may decline the draw offer by making a move, in which case the draw offer is no longer in effect, or else indicate acceptance. The offer of a draw should be recorded by each player in their score sheet using the symbol (=) as per Appendix C.12 of FIDE Laws of Chess.

===Scoring===
In early tournaments, draws were often replayed until one of the players won; however, this was found to be impractical and caused organizational difficulties. The 1867 Paris tournament even ignored draws altogether, effectively treating them as double losses. The 1867 Dundee tournament initiated the awarding of a half point for draws, which is now standard practice. A minority of tournaments use a different scoring scheme, such as &quot;football scoring&quot; where 3 points are awarded to the winner and 1 point to each in the event of a draw. For the purpose of calculating Elo rating, these tournaments are treated as if they were using standard scoring.

==Draws in all games==
Article 5 of the 2018 FIDE Laws of Chess gives the basic ways a game may end in a draw; more complicated ways are detailed in Article 9:

* Stalemate – if the player on turn has no legal move but is not in check, this is stalemate and the game is automatically a draw.
* Threefold repetition rule – if an identical position has occurred at least three times during the course of the game with the same player to move each time, and is the current position on the board or will occur after the player on turn makes their move, the player on move may claim a draw (to the ). In such a case the draw is not automatic – a player must claim it if they want the draw. When the position occurs for the third time after the player&#x27;s intended next move, they write the move on their but does not make the move on the board and claims the draw. Article 9.2 states that a position is considered identical to another if the same player is on move, the same types of pieces of the same colors occupy the same squares, and the same moves are available to each player; in particular, each player has the same castling and &quot;en passant&quot; capturing rights. (A player may lose their right to castle; and an &quot;en passant&quot; capture is available only at the first opportunity.) If the claim is not made on the move in which the repetition occurs, the player forfeits the right to make the claim. Of course, the opportunity may present itself again.
** Fivefold repetition – If the same position occurs five times during the course of the game, the game is automatically a draw (i.e. a player does not have to claim it).
* Fifty-move rule – if in the previous 50 moves by each side, no pawn has moved and no has been made, a draw may be claimed by either player. Here again, the draw is not automatic and must be claimed if the player wants the draw. If the player whose turn it is to move has made only 49 such moves, they may write their next move on the scoresheet and claim a draw. As with the threefold repetition, the right to claim the draw is forfeited if it is not used on that move, but the opportunity may occur again.
** Seventy-five-move rule – If no capture or no pawn move has occurred in the last 75 moves (by both players), the game is automatically a draw (i.e. a player does not have to claim it). If the last move was a checkmate, the checkmate stands.
* Impossibility of checkmate – if a position arises in which neither player could possibly give checkmate by a series of legal moves, the game is a draw. Such a position is called a dead position. This is usually because there is insufficient material left, but it is possible in other positions too, such as a blocked king and pawn ending where it is impossible for either king to capture the pawns. Combinations with insufficient material to checkmate include:
** king versus king
** king and bishop versus king
** king and knight versus king
** king and bishop versus king and bishop with the bishops on the same color.
* Mutual agreement – a player may offer a draw to their opponent at any stage of a game. If the opponent accepts, the game is a draw.

There is no longer a rule defining perpetual check—a situation in which one player gives a series of checks from which the other player cannot escape—as a draw. Any perpetual check situation will eventually be claimable as a draw under the threefold repetition rule or the fifty-move rule; more commonly the players will simply agree a draw. By 1965, perpetual check was no longer in the rules.

Although these are the laws as laid down by FIDE and, as such, are used at almost all top-level tournaments, at lower levels different rules may operate, particularly with regard to rapid play finish provisions.

===Examples===






==Draws in timed games==
In games played with a time control, there are other ways a draw can occur.
* In a sudden death time control (players have a limited time to play all of their moves), if it is discovered that both players have exceeded their time allotment, the game is a draw. (The game continues if it is not a sudden-death time control.)
* If only one player has exceeded the time limit, but the other player does not have sufficient mating material, the game is still a draw. Law 6.9 of the FIDE Laws of Chess states that: &quot;If a player does not complete the prescribed number of moves in the allotted time, the game is lost by the player. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot checkmate the player&#x27;s king by any possible series of legal moves, even with the most unskilled counterplay.&quot; It is still possible to lose on time in positions where mate is extremely unlikely but not theoretically impossible, as with king and bishop versus king and knight. (Under USCF rules, king and bishop, king and knight, or king and 2 knights with no pawns on the board is not considered sufficient mating material, unless the opponent has a forced win, even though it is theoretically possible to mate (but extremely unlikely to happen) in situations such as K+B vs. K+N). There are differences between USCF and FIDE rules, whereby USCF requires checkmate be forced and FIDE requires it only be legally possible.
* Because of this last possibility, article 10 of the FIDE laws of chess states that when a player has less than two minutes left on their clock during a rapid play finish (the end of a game when all remaining moves must be completed within a limited amount of time), they may claim a draw if their opponent is not attempting to win the game by &quot;normal means&quot; or cannot win the game by &quot;normal means&quot;. &quot;Normal means&quot; can be taken to mean the delivery of checkmate or the winning of material. In other words, a draw is claimable if the opponent is merely attempting to win on time, or cannot possibly win except on time. It is up to the arbiter to decide whether such a claim will be granted or not.

==Frequency of draws==

In chess games played at the top level, a draw is the most common outcome of a game: of around 22,000 games published in &quot;The Week in Chess&quot; played between 1999 and 2002 by players with a FIDE Elo rating of 2500 or above, 55 percent were draws. According to chess analyst Jeff Sonas, although an upward draw rate trend can be observed in general master-level play since the beginning of the 20th century, it is currently &quot;holding pretty steady around 50%, and is only increasing at a very slow rate&quot;. The draw rate of elite grandmasters, rated more than 2750 Elo, is, however, significantly higher, surpassing 70% in 2017 and 2018.

In top-level correspondence chess under ICCF, where computer assistance is allowed, the draw rate is much higher than in the over-the-board chess: of 1512 games played in the World Championship finals and the Candidates&#x27; sections between 2010 and 2013, 82.3% ended in a draw. Since that time, draw rate in top-level correspondence play has been rising steadily, reaching 97% in 2019. Engine tests strongly suggest that the result of a perfectly played game is a draw, and that the draw margin is quite large: White cannot force a win without Black making significant mistakes.

The high draw rate has often led to fears of &quot;draw death&quot;, as the top players draw an ever-increasing percentage of their games and the game becomes played out: such sentiments have been expressed by World Champions Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, Bobby Fischer, and Vladimir Kramnik. All four advocated changing the rules of chess to avoid the problem, and with the advent of modern chess engines playing at an extremely high level, their ideas have been tested. Based on tests in correspondence and engine play, GM Larry Kaufman (one of the original authors of Komodo) and correspondence chess grandmaster Arno Nickel have suggested an extension of Lasker&#x27;s proposal, which would score stalemate, king and minor piece versus king with the superior side to move (similar to the old bare king rule), and threefold repetition as ¾–¼ rather than draws – for threefold repetition, this means penalising the player who brought about a repetition with ¼ of a point, which is similar to how repetitions are sometimes forbidden in xiangqi, shogi, and Go. (Lasker&#x27;s original proposal was only for stalemate and bare king; it was supported by Richard Réti and considered not harmful – though unnecessary – by Max Euwe. Capablanca thought that doing this for stalemate would be enough.) Engine tests by Kaufman using Komodo suggest that at over-the-board human World Championship level, this would lower the draw rate from 65.6% to just 22.6%.

Other ideas have also been suggested, such as the &quot;football scoring&quot;: 0 for a loss, 1 for a draw, and 3 for a win, which is equivalent to scoring draws as ⅓–⅓ rather than ½–½. This has been criticised, however. Kaufman argues that this solution misses the point: it reduces the incentive to draw, but the reason for the high draw rate is not one of incentives, but rather that White&#x27;s first-move advantage is not enough to win. Thus Kaufman calls this solution &quot;terrible&quot;, going against &quot;the very nature of the game&quot;: he writes that &quot;The inferior side should be trying to draw, and to penalize Black for obtaining a good result is crazy. It makes chess like a game of &#x27;chicken&#x27;; who will &#x27;blink&#x27; first and play an unsound move to avoid the mutually bad result of a draw?&quot; Nickel has likewise criticised this idea as &quot;wholly inadequate&quot;, creating &quot;an artificial and empty pressure at best&quot;, and creating unfairness and incentivising &quot;game manipulations&quot; in team events or double round-robins. Kaufman speaks more favourably of an idea by Ed Epp, which is to score draws as 0.4–0.6, equalising the expected score for White and Black; but while he writes that he is &quot;all for this idea&quot;, he also admits that &quot;the benefit would be small, most games would have the same outcome&quot;.

==Drawing combinations==
Yuri Averbakh gives these combinations for the weaker side to draw:
* perpetual check
* stalemate
* blockade
* perpetual pursuit
* fortress
* drawing balance of forces

==Terminology==

* A &quot;book draw&quot; or &quot;theoretical draw&quot; is a position that is known to result in a draw if both sides .
* A &quot;positional draw&quot; is an impasse other than stalemate, where a draw is salvaged despite a big material disadvantage (see ).
* A &quot;grandmaster draw&quot; is a game in which the players quickly agree to a draw after making little or no effort to win (see ).

Andy Soltis discusses the vagueness of the terms &quot;draw&quot;, &quot;drawish&quot;, &quot;drawable&quot;, &quot;book draw&quot;, &quot;easy draw&quot;, and &quot;dead draw&quot;. In books and chess theory a position is considered to be a draw if best play leads to a draw – the difficulty of the defence is not taken into account. Soltis calls these positions &quot;drawable&quot;. For instance, under that criterion the rook and bishop versus rook endgame is usually a theoretical draw or book draw, but the side with the bishop often wins in practice. In this position from an actual game, the only move to draw is 124.Rf8! White actually played 124.Rd8 and lost after 124...Re3, with the winning threat of 125...Bh3+ 126.Kg1 Re1#.

<text>The Sky Tower is a telecommunications and observation tower in Auckland, New Zealand. Located at the corner of Victoria and Federal Streets within the city&#x27;s CBD, it is tall, as measured from ground level to the top of the mast, making it the second tallest freestanding structure in the Southern Hemisphere, surpassed only by the Autograph Tower in Jakarta, Indonesia, and the 28th tallest tower in the world. Since its completion in 1997, the Sky Tower has become an iconic landmark in Auckland&#x27;s skyline, due to its height and design. It was the tallest freestanding structure in the Southern Hemisphere from 1996 to 2022.

The tower is part of the SkyCity Auckland casino complex, originally built in 1994–1997 for Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment. Several upper levels are accessible to the public, attracting an average of 1,150 visitors per day (over 415,000 per year).

==Public facilities==

The Sky Tower has several upper levels that are accessible to the public:

* Level 50: Sky Bar
* Level 51: Main Observation Deck
* Level 52: Orbit 360° Dining
* Level 53: The Lookout observation deck and ice creamery, SkyWalk and SkyJump
* Level 60: Sky Deck

The upper portion of the tower contains two restaurants and a cafe; including New Zealand&#x27;s only revolving restaurant, located from the ground, which turns 360 degrees every hour. There is also a brasserie-style buffet located one floor above the main observatory level. It has three observation decks at different heights, each providing 360-degree views of the city. The main observation level at has thick glass sections of flooring giving a view straight to the ground. The top observation deck labelled &quot;Skydeck&quot; sits just below the main antenna at and gives views of up to in the distance.

The tower also features the &quot;SkyJump&quot;, a jump from the observation deck, during which a jumper can reach up to . The jump is guide-cable-controlled to prevent jumpers from colliding with the tower in case of wind gusts. Climbs into the antenna mast portion ( heights) are also possible for tour groups, as is a walk around the exterior.

==Construction==
===Project history===

The first iteration of the tower was proposed to be built on Upper Symonds St in Eden Terrace alongside a shopping centre. The early-1990s plan was rejected due to viewshaft issues. An earlier version of the tower&#x27;s design would have seen it clad in stainless steel, however this was not progressed due to costs.

The tower was constructed as a part of the Skycity casino precinct. The Skycity Entertainment Group&#x27;s initial brief for the project were that they required a tower that was both a high-quality tourist attraction, and a marketable telecommunications facility. Fletcher Construction was the contracted builder for the project while engineering firm Beca Group provided the design management and coordination, structural, geotechnical, civil, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, lighting and fire engineering services. Harrison Grierson provided surveying services. It was designed by Gordon Moller of Craig Craig Moller Architects and has received a New Zealand Institute of Architects National Award as well as regional awards. The project architect was Les Dykstra. Taking two years and nine months to construct, the tower was opened on 3 August 1997.

===Facts and figures===
The tower is constructed of high-performance reinforced concrete. Its diameter shaft (containing four lifts and an emergency stairwell) is supported on eight &quot;legs&quot; based on 16 foundation piles drilled over deep into the local sandstone. The main shaft was built using climbing formwork.

The upper levels were constructed from composite materials, structural steel, precast concrete and reinforced concrete, and the observation decks clad in aluminium with blue/green reflective glass. A structural steel framework supports the upper mast structure. During construction of concrete, of reinforcing steel, and of structural steel were used. The mast weighs over . It had to be lifted into place using a crane attached to the structure, as it would have been too heavy for a helicopter to lift. To then remove the crane, another crane had to be constructed attached to the upper part of the Sky Tower structure, which dismantled the big crane, and was in turn dismantled into pieces small enough to fit into the elevator.

===Safety===
The tower is designed to withstand wind in excess of and designed to sway up to in excessively high winds. As a safety precaution the Sky Tower&#x27;s lifts have special technology installed to detect movement (such as swaying due to high wind) and will automatically slow down. If the building sway exceeds predetermined safety levels the lifts will return to the ground floor and remain there until the high winds and building sway have abated.

The Sky Tower is built to withstand an 8.0 magnitude earthquake located within a radius. There are three fireproof rooms on levels 44, 45, and 46 to provide refuge in the event of an emergency, while the central service lift shaft and stairwells are also fire-safety rated.

==Telecommunications==
The tower is also used for telecommunications and broadcasting with the Auckland Peering Exchange (APE) being located on Level 48. The aerial at the top of the tower hosts the largest FM combiner in the world which combines with 58 wireless microwave links located above the top restaurant to provide a number of services. These include television, wireless internet, RT, and weather measurement services.

The tower is Auckland&#x27;s primary FM radio transmitter, and is one of four infill terrestrial television transmitters in Auckland, serving areas not covered by the main transmitter at Waiatarua in the Waitākere Ranges. A total of twenty-three FM radio stations and six digital terrestrial television multiplexes broadcast from the tower. Two VHF analogue television channels broadcasting from the tower were switched off in the early hours of 1 December 2013 as part of New Zealand&#x27;s digital television transition.

==Lighting==


SkyCity Auckland lights the Sky Tower to show support for a range of organisations and charities. SkyCity has a lighting policy and the public is invited to suggest additional occasions in line with this policy. Common lighting events include:
* All colours = New Year&#x27;s Eve/New Year’s Day
* Blue = Blue September (prostate cancer awareness month in NZ)
* Pink = Breast Cancer Awareness Month or Mother&#x27;s Day
* Red &amp; Green = Christmas
* Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Gold &amp; White = New Year&#x27;s Eve
* Red &amp; Gold = Chinese New Year
* Green = Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day
* Red top = Anzac Day (with Poppy emblem projection) or Cure Kids Red Nose Day (fundraising appeal for children&#x27;s health research)
* Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple = Pride Month
* Orange at the base fading to yellow at the top = Matariki
* Green base and yellow top = Daffodil Day (Cancer Society New Zealand) 
* No lighting (except aircraft warning lights) = Earth Hour or day in memorial of the death of the head of state, the governor-general, the prime minister, any governmental member or important people.
The tower is lit up for special occasions. Examples include New Zealand&#x27;s 2021 vaccination campaign, with the tower illuminated in blue and white when 80% and 90% vaccination rates were achieved. The tower was blue and yellow in early March 2022 in solidarity with Ukraine over the 2022 Russian invasion. After SkyCity initially refused requests from members of the public to lend support, Phil Goff as mayor of Auckland intervened and the Sky Tower was one of three Auckland landmarks that was lit up for three days (the others were the Auckland Harbour Bridge and Auckland War Memorial Museum). The tower went blue to honour the death of Constable Matthew Hunt. Also in March 2022, the tower was red celebrating the Auckland Arts Festival.

===Energy efficient lighting===
The top half of the Sky Tower is lit by energy efficient LED lighting which replaced the original metal halide floodlights in May 2009. The LEDs can produce millions of different colour combinations controlled by a DMX lighting controller. The original lights used 66 per cent more energy than the current LED system. The bottom half remained lit by metal halide lamps, until they too were upgraded to LED lighting in 2019.

===Energy conservation initiatives===
In an effort to promote power saving, SkyCity turned off the tower lighting in Winter 2008, retaining only the flashing red aviation lights. SkyCity is also minimising façade flood lighting across its complex. Simon Jamieson, general manager SkyCity Auckland Hotels Group, said: &quot;Like every New Zealander, we are concerned about the country&#x27;s electricity supply, and we believe it is our responsibility to make this move to assist with the power saving request.&quot; The tower was reilluminated on 4 August in support of New Zealand athletes competing at the Beijing Olympics.

===Events===
The Sky Tower is used in support of special charity events. The Leukemia and Blood Foundation of New Zealand organises annual fundraising stair climb challenges, notably the &quot;Firefighters Sky Tower Stair Challenge&quot; which sees firefighters from around New Zealand race up 1,108 steps (out of 1,267 total steps). Climbing the Sky Tower stairs has been described as a &quot;vertical marathon&quot;.

<text>Soul jazz or funky jazz is a subgenre of jazz that incorporates strong influences from hard bop, blues, soul, gospel and rhythm and blues. Soul jazz is often characterized by organ trios featuring the Hammond organ and small combos including saxophone, brass instruments, electric guitar, bass, drums, piano, vocals and electric organ. Its origins were in the 1950s and early 1960s, with its heyday with popular audiences preceding the rise of jazz fusion in the late 1960s and 1970s. Prominent names in fusion ranged from bop pianists including Bobby Timmons and Junior Mance to a wide range of organists, saxophonists, pianists, drummers and electric guitarists including Jack McDuff, Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, and Grant Green.

==Musical style==
Soul jazz is often associated with hard bop. Mark C. Gridley, writing for the &quot;All Music Guide to Jazz&quot;, explains that soul jazz more specifically refers to music with &quot;an earthy, bluesy melodic concept&quot; and &quot;repetitive, dance-like rhythms... Note that some listeners make no distinction between &#x27;soul-jazz&#x27; and &#x27;funky hard bop,&#x27; and many musicians don&#x27;t consider &#x27;soul-jazz&#x27; to be continuous with &#x27;hard bop.

According to Nick Morrison, the subgenre &quot;usually begins with the bass player&quot; who &quot;take[s] a strong bass line, establish[es] a steady groove between the bass and drums&quot;, before the band can &quot;embellish that groove with riffs and melody lines&quot;.

Jazz pianist Horace Silver stated that &quot;[f]unky means earthy and blues-based. It might not be blues itself, but it does have that &#x27;down-home&#x27; feel to it. Soul is basically the same, but there&#x27;s an added dimension of feeling and spirit.&quot;

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Roy Carr has described soul jazz as an outgrowth of hard bop, with the terms &quot;funk&quot; and &quot;soul&quot; appearing in a jazz context as early as the mid-1950s to describe &quot;gospel-informed, down-home, call-and-response blues&quot;. Carr has also noted the influence of Ray Charles&#x27; small group recordings (which included saxophonists David &quot;Fathead&quot; Newman and Hank Crawford) on Horace Silver, Art Blakey, Cannonball Adderley. In his view, David Sanborn and Maceo Parker are in a line of alto saxophonists that includes Earl Bostic, Tab Smith, Adderley, and Lou Donaldson as the strongest links in the chain of the genre&#x27;s evolution.

In the early to mid-1950s, after he left the Count Basie Orchestra, saxophonist Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis was among the first to form a jazz group with both organ and saxophone, first with Bill Doggett and later Shirley Scott. For this and his &quot;full bodied yet reedy tone that was equally at home in rhythm &amp; blues settings as more modern contexts,&quot; he &quot;provided a link&quot; between big band swing and soul jazz.

Soul jazz continued to develop in the late 1950s, reaching public awareness with the release of &quot;The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco&quot;. Cannonball Adderley noted: &quot;We were pressured quite heavily by Riverside Records when they discovered there was a word called &#x27;soul&#x27;. We became, from an image point of view, soul jazz artists. They kept promoting us that way and I kept deliberately fighting it, to the extent that it became a game.&quot; Late 1950s, soul jazz artist Curtis Fuller recorded &quot;Five Spot after Dark&quot;.

=== Mainstream ===

Jimmy Smith&#x27;s shift into soul jazz demonstrated the organ&#x27;s potential within the genre with his albums &quot;Home Cookin&#x27;&quot; (1961) and &quot;Back at the Chicken Shack&quot; (1963). Other organists who recorded in the soul jazz genre during this period include Jack McDuff, Shirley Scott, and Charles Earland. With the addition of former bebop and hard-bop musicians to the genre, the number of musicians within various facets of the style increased as soul jazz became a subgenre in its own right; and like its bop predecessor, the new genre of jazz reworked popular songs, such as &quot;Got My Mojo Workin&#x27;,&quot; while saxophone and trumpet players recently converted to the genre composed hits including &quot;The Sidewinder&quot;, &quot;Mercy, Mercy, Mercy&quot; and &quot;Listen Here&quot; during the mid-1960s.

An accelerating factor in soul jazz&#x27;s development was the Black Power movement, which led African-American musicians to return to the African roots of their music. Tunes recorded within the genre, including &quot;Mercy, Mercy, Mercy&quot; and &quot;Let My People Go&quot; were direct references to the civil rights and Black Power movements. For instance, Adderley&#x27;s music from the period has been described as containing an &quot;irrepressible exuberance&quot;. Interest in the genre broadened when Adderley introduced Austrian-born keyboardist Joe Zawinul to soul jazz through his Quintet, with Zawinul contributing to its repertoire with his own compositions.

Likewise Stanley Turrentine, who began recording with Jimmy Smith in 1960 and rapidly expanded his audience, lamented the lack of jazz on radio and TV, saying that more people, and particularly African Americans, would have listened to soul jazz had it received as much exposure as rock music. The tenor saxophone player recorded a number of soul jazz albums throughout the 1960s, including &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (1963) with his wife Shirley Scott. Jazz critic Thom Jurek noted that on the recording &quot;the organ acts as the testifying pulpit from which to speak, and Turrentine not only speaks, he weeps and whispers and wails.&quot; Turrentine&#x27;s following album, &quot;A Chip Off the Old Block&quot; (1963), marked the first shift in influence, in this case from the swing/big band era with compositions by Count Basie and Neal Hefti. Turrentine&#x27;s wife again contributed in addition to hard bop trumpeter Blue Mitchell. In the mid- to late-1960s, Turrentine evolved his soul jazz style from the small-group setting traditionally associated with the subgenre to an ensemble format, with &quot;Joyride&quot; (1965) arranged by fellow jazz saxophonist Oliver Nelson.

While Turrentine developed the core of the &quot;soul&quot; in soul jazz, Latin and funky influences developed soul jazz upon the foundation of bop. Pianist Herbie Hancock, for instance, was instrumental in pushing the boundaries of music theory and chord progressions during the 1960s. Hancock&#x27;s first album &quot;Takin&#x27; Off&quot; (1962) featured the funky &quot;Watermelon Man&quot;, a composition recorded by both Hancock and Mongo Santamaria, and was notable for &quot;spare, funky piano riffing and tight, focused solo statements&quot; that enabled Hancock to &quot;begin pushing the boundaries of hard bop.&quot; The 1960s saw Hancock and trumpeter Lee Morgan&#x27;s compositions be used in TV, with &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; by Hancock appearing in a Fabergé commercial and Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Sidewinder&quot; in a Chrysler commercial. Popularizations of jazz compositions, such as the renditions of &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; by Santamaria and Gloria Lynne, went further to make soul jazz appealing to Black audiences, particularly in the early to mid-1960s, though this shifted over the course of the decade so much that by the late 1960s, the jazz musicians themselves were producing hit records, with six Jimmy Smith/Blue Note albums reaching the top 200. However, jazz labels such as Blue Note found it difficult to compete with larger record companies for advertising opportunities.

The growing popularity of soul jazz meant that, for many hard bop musicians, the shift from bop to soul jazz was not clearly defined, with Horace Silver releasing hard bop album &quot;The Jody Grind&quot; in 1966, and the more soul-influenced &quot;Serenade to a Soul Sister&quot; – starring Turrentine – in 1968. The latter album was described by Steve Huey as &quot;one of the pianist&#x27;s most infectiously cheerful, good-humored outings.&quot; Silver wrote in the album&#x27;s liner notes that he believed his music should avoid &quot;politics, hatred, or anger.&quot; Tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley took even longer to make the shift, playing primarily within the hard bop genre until 1968, when he recorded &quot;Reach Out!&quot; with a light soul jazz feel. His following album &quot;The Flip&quot; (1969) blended soul jazz and hard bop on its title track, according to Jurek. Other jazz artists, such as Lee Morgan, wavered in and out of the soul jazz genre. Drawing influence from the reliably hard bop Jazz Messengers, Morgan&#x27;s albums of the mid-1960s could be described as both hard bop and soul jazz. Morgan hired bop musicians for the album but recorded soul-influenced material, for instance on the album &quot;Cornbread&quot; (1965).

Other soul jazz musicians had their roots almost entirely in soul and blues. Organist Jack McDuff, for example, was known for his particularly bluesy style, which enabled him to collaborate with young jazz talents including saxophonist Johnny Griffin and guitarist George Benson. McDuff&#x27;s band focused on &quot;groove-centric&quot; music but in the later &#x27;60s experimented with popular songs and larger ensembles, particularly on his album &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (1967). In contrast, former McDuff sideman and guitarist Pat Martino utilized an organ trio format during the late 1960s, with the live &quot;Young Guns&quot; (2014) album recorded at Club 118 in 1968 and 1969 featuring Gene Ludwig on organ and Randy Gelispie on drums.

Among the best-known soul jazz recordings from the era are Lee Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Sidewinder&quot; (1963), Frank Foster&#x27;s &quot;Samba Blues&quot; (1963), Nat Adderley&#x27;s &quot;Work Song&quot;, Horace Silver&#x27;s &quot;Song for My Father&quot; (1964), Ramsey Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The &#x27;In&#x27; Crowd&quot; (a top-five hit in 1965), Cannonball Adderley&#x27;s &quot;Mercy, Mercy, Mercy&quot; (1966) (also popularized further when covered as a top-40 pop song by the Buckinghams the following year), and Young Holt Unlimited &quot;Soulful Strut&quot;. Les McCann and Eddie Harris&#x27;s album &quot;Swiss Movement&quot; (1969) was a hit record, as was the accompanying single &quot;Compared to What&quot;, with both selling millions of units.

=== Fusion ===
Soul jazz began to mold into jazz fusion by the late 1960s, with musicians such as Turrentine moving to the CTI fusion label in the early 1970s and free jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler moving into jazz-rock during the late 1960s before his untimely death in 1970. With the temporary decline of Blue Note and the rapid rise of the CTI label, soul jazz moved toward smooth jazz and popular music of the day, with the label&#x27;s founder Creed Taylor remarking that his original goal of creating jazz for listening had &quot;backfired&quot; into the development of background music.

Others pushed the boundaries of soul jazz to the extent it became fused with other genres. Tenor saxophonist Eddie Harris switched to the electric saxophone for his album titled &quot;The Electrifying Eddie Harris&quot; (1968). His experiments in &quot;funk-influenced fusion, outside improvisations, bizarre electronic effects, new crossbreedings of traditional instruments, blues crooning, and even comedy,&quot; according to Steve Huey, &quot;fell outside the bounds of what critics considered legitimate, serious jazz.&quot; He returned to bop late in his career.

== Legacy ==
Although soul jazz was most popular during the mid-to-late 1960s, its musicians and musical influences remained popular past this time period.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, the genre saw increased crossover with fusion. The Jazz Crusaders, for example, evolved from soul jazz to soul music, becoming the Crusaders in the process.

<doc id="264344" wikidata="Q3512522" url="?curid=264344" title="Cars (song)">
<text>&quot;Cars&quot; is the first solo single by English musician Gary Numan. It was released on 24 August 1979 and is from his debut studio album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;. The song reached the top of the charts in several countries, and is Numan&#x27;s most successful single.

== Overview ==
The song was the first release credited solely to Gary Numan after he dropped the band name Tubeway Army, under which he had released four singles and two LPs, including the number one UK hit &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot;, and its parent album &quot;Replicas&quot;. Musically, the new song was somewhat lighter and more pop-oriented than its predecessors, Numan later said that he had chart success in mind: &quot;This was the first time I had written a song with the intention of &#x27;maybe it could be a hit single&#x27;; I was writing this before &#x27;Are &quot;Friends&quot; Electric?&#x27; happened.&quot; He has since described &quot;Cars&quot; as &quot;a pretty average song&quot;.

In the UK charts, it reached number 1 in 1979, and in 1980, it hit number 1 in Canada two weeks running on the &quot;RPM&quot; national singles chart (29 weeks in the top 100), his only single to chart there. The single was first issued in the US in February 1980, where it peaked at #4 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 and #9 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on June 7, 1980, remaining at that position for three weeks. Although Numan had a string of hits in the UK, &quot;Cars&quot; was his only song in the American pop charts. Remixed versions of the song again reached the top 20 in the UK in 1987 and 1996 respectively.

==Composition==
&quot;Cars&quot; is based on two musical sections: a verse/instrumental break and a bridge. The recording features a conventional rock rhythm section of bass guitar and drums, but the rest of the instruments used are analogue synthesisers, principally the Minimoog (augmenting the song&#x27;s recognisable bass riff) and the Polymoog keyboard, providing austere synthetic string lines over the bass riff. The bridge section also includes a tambourine part. Numan&#x27;s vocal part is sung in an almost expressionless, synthesized style. There is no &quot;chorus&quot; as such, and no more lyrics after the 1:30 point.

According to Numan, the song&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by an incident of road rage:

Numan later said that the entire song was written in 30 minutes, originating in the bass riff, which was the first thing he played on a newly bought bass guitar.

==Release and promotion==
The original UK single was released in August 1979, backed with a non-album instrumental track called &quot;Asylum&quot;. The US B-side was &quot;Metal&quot;, from &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; The track has been a UK Top 20 hit for Numan in three successive decades: on its original release in 1979 (reaching number 1), in 1987 as the &#x27;E Reg Model&#x27; remix (reaching number 16), and in 1996 following its use in an advertisement for Carling Premier beer (reaching number 17). Numan has performed the song onstage since its original release, and it appears on all but one of his official live albums to date.

The music video featured Numan&#x27;s then-current backing band, including Billy Currie from the band Ultravox, but he had not played on the recording of &quot;Cars&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release in 1979, &quot;Smash Hits&quot; reviewer Steve Bush wrote: &quot;With its distant haunting message of doom, &quot;Cars&quot; doesn&#x27;t stray very far from the themes of the excellent &#x27;Replicas&quot; album, although the new lyrics are shorter and the vocals sharper. The instrumental B side is a rip-off of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Warsawa&quot;, with mad, tinkling piano. All in all, this is a disappointing follow up to &quot;Friends&quot;&quot;. Garry Bushell in &quot;Sounds&quot; was cynical of both Numan and the single, yet adds, &quot;Jimmy Pursey tells me this will be number one. He&#x27;s probably right.&quot;
Retrospectively, &quot;Cars&quot; has been called &quot;one of the greatest singles in pop history&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2012, George Chesterton found &quot;the force of the multi-layered Moog synthesiser parts is almost overwhelming. Using effects usually associated with heavy guitars – reverb, flanging and phasers – Numan drenched the gliding synth lines so they flow over you like wave after wave of ice water. These build throughout the song until the fantastical 1&#x27;30&quot; fadeout, during which the Polymoogs – used as elements of a string section – are folded on top of each other in hypnotic harmonies that reinforce the song&#x27;s sense of eerie dystopia.&quot; Chesterton also noted that the song, unlike many similar contemporaries, had aged well lyrically: &quot;Cars contains a bit of futurology that was rather sophisticated. Numan positions the car not as a mode of mechanical transport, but as a fetishised, abstract interface with the rest of the world. This is – in a pop form – what the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard had been writing about a few years earlier. To be fair to Numan, this notion of the car in relation to individuals and society has only deepened in the decades since.&quot;

Numan performed &quot;Cars&quot; using a set of two dozen automobiles and their horns in an innovative 2010 commercial for DieHard. All of the cars were powered from one single battery. James Frost of Zoo Films directed the video, and Synn Labs, which had previously worked with the band OK Go, engineered the cars.

==Fear Factory version==
Fear Factory, an American industrial metal band, recorded a version of &quot;Cars&quot; and released it as the second single from their album &quot;Obsolete&quot;. The song was only included as a bonus track on the limited edition digipak re-release of &quot;Obsolete&quot; and would be instrumental in breaking Fear Factory into the mainstream. In their rendition, Gary Numan performs a duet with frontman Burton C. Bell.

===Background and recording===
According to Bell, around 1996, the band started performing &quot;Cars&quot; as an encore at European concerts. Word spread that Fear Factory was performing the song, and as a result, Gary Numan&#x27;s manager contacted them. Upon request, Numan&#x27;s management flew him out to the Vancouver studio for a three-day span to record vocals on &quot;Cars.&quot; The band also asked Numan to record a spoken word piece for the introduction of the song &quot;Obsolete&quot;.

Numan had a long-standing dislike for being associated with what he perceived as dated music, and this initially made him apprehensive of working with Fear Factory until realizing &quot;there was a chance that it could introduce me to a new generation of people who didn&#x27;t know my history. And that can be useful, because my music&#x27;s got a lot heavier and darker anyway.&quot; The result would be satisfactory for both parties, and Numan praised the band as &quot;brilliant, really easy to work with. They didn&#x27;t have a bad word to say about anyone.&quot;

The uncharacteristically bouncy and bright rendition somewhat contrasts with Fear Factory&#x27;s reputation for intense, grinding metal, while the heavy use of synthesizer and other electronic elements corresponds with the band&#x27;s industrial style. Drummer Raymond Herrera described the cover as &quot;basically like a blueprint of a futuristic car.&quot; He added that, while other songs were considered, the band chose &quot;Cars&quot; because all the band members knew and appreciated it and because the keyboards suited Fear Factory&#x27;s sound. Herrera later noted that the group initially wanted to record U2&#x27;s &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; but chose &quot;Cars&quot; because they were fortunate enough to have Numan participate. Fear Factory later covered the U2 song &quot;I Will Follow,&quot; in 2005.

===Reception===
&quot;Cars&quot; played a significant part in &quot;Obsolete&quot;″s status as Fear Factory&#x27;s highest-selling album. By 2001, it had sold over 750,000 copies. According to Herrera, the cover received greater enthusiasm in the UK than in the band&#x27;s native US, which was validated by its chart status. During the song&#x27;s promotion, Gary Numan joined the band for a concert performance in Brixton, London to much enthusiasm.

After the radio trade publication &quot;R&amp;R&quot; listed &quot;Cars&quot; as the most added track on both active rock and mainstream rock in May 1999, the song earned &quot;Breaker&quot; status and continued to surge up the chart. &quot;Cars&quot; debuted and peaked at number 57 in the UK Singles Chart on 9 October.

It peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart and No. 38 on Modern Rock Tracks.

The song was featured as the main theme for &quot;Test Drive 6&quot;, a video game released in 1999 for the PlayStation and Dreamcast consoles.

===Music video===
Numan also appears in the sci-fi music video, directed by John S. Bartley and filmed in Vancouver, which debuted in June 1999. Bell enthusiastically described the ambitious video as having a &quot;Stanley Kubrick-type of vibe to it&quot;:

According to Bell, at one point during the shoot, Numan remarked, &quot;Odd; the song is about cars – why are we in space?&quot;

===Track listing===
# &quot;Cars&quot; (remix) – 3:39
# &quot;Descent&quot; (Falling Deeper Mix) – 4:38
# &quot;Edgecrusher&quot; (Urban Assault Mix) – 4:33

===Charts===

==Other appearances==
In 2009, Chicane sampled &quot;Cars&quot; in &quot;Hiding All the Stars&quot;, which reached No. 42 in the UK and No. 23 in Belgium.

Toronto-based alternative rock quartet Sloan performed a version of the song in June 2011 for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; A.V. Undercover series.

<doc id="264347" wikidata="Q5302969" url="?curid=264347" title="Down in the Park">
<text>&quot;Down in the Park&quot; is a 1979 song by the English band Tubeway Army, featuring lead vocals by Gary Numan. It was released as the first single from the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Replicas&quot;, though was not a hit. The song was written and produced by the band&#x27;s frontman Gary Numan, and despite its lack of commercial success, has been performed by Numan regularly in his live shows throughout the years.

==Style==
Like the &quot;Replicas&quot; album as a whole, &quot;Down in the Park&quot; marked a major shift from Tubeway Army&#x27;s previous output. The band&#x27;s early releases, the 1978 singles &quot;That&#x27;s Too Bad&quot; and &quot;Bombers&quot; plus the self-titled debut album, contained elements of punk, hard rock, heavy metal and new wave but were exclusively guitar driven with only occasional use of primitive synthesizer effects. &quot;Down in the Park&quot;, on the other hand, was Numan&#x27;s first composition on keyboards and his first release to feature the predominantly electronic sound that became his trademark. Musically, it pared down still further the guitar power chord and bass root note style arrangements he had used previously, reducing the harmony to bare unisons of layered bass guitar, Fender Rhodes electric piano, and Polymoog synthesizer. The semitone key changes (A to B) and chromatic melodic riffs between the song&#x27;s verses are somewhat unusual in the context of traditional Western music theory, although they are less unusual in rock music.

==Lyrics==
Lyrically the song crystallised the dystopian science fiction concept that was the basis of the &quot;Replicas&quot; album. Heavily influenced by such writers as J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick, it tells the story of a futuristic park in which Machmen (androids with human skin) and machines rape and kill human beings to entertain spectators who, along with their numerically named robotic &quot;friends&quot; (&quot;Down in the Park, with a friend called Five&quot;), view the carnage from a nearby restaurant, &quot;Zom Zoms&quot; – the name inspired by a recurring reference to the Zum Zum restaurant chain in the Jobriath song &quot;Scumbag&quot;.

==Theme==
The piece was typical of Numan&#x27;s themes at the time, both embracing and fearing technology. In contrast to much contemporary post-punk music, and his own earlier releases, Numan&#x27;s vocals were deliberately underplayed, leaving the slow and stately synthesizer work to evoke the song&#x27;s melancholy atmosphere.

==B-side==
In what would become Numan&#x27;s normal practice, the B-side was a non-album track, in this case &quot;Do You Need the Service?&quot;; the title referenced a line from the works of William S. Burroughs, the service in question meaning pest control. The 12&quot; single included the same tracks as the 7&quot; along with &quot;I Nearly Married A Human (2)&quot;, a different mix from the version on &quot;Replicas&quot; this time featuring drum machine throughout and Numan&#x27;s recitation of the song&#x27;s title, the only words heard.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Down in the Park&quot; has been covered by a number of artists, notably Marilyn Manson on the &quot;Lunchbox&quot; and &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; singles (1995), Foo Fighters on &quot;The X-Files&quot; &quot;Songs in the Key of X&quot; soundtrack album (1996), DJ Hell (a 1998 techno version with lyrics translated in French entitled &quot;Dans Le Parc&quot;), Christian Death (a live performance on &quot;The Iron Mask&quot;), Girls Under Glass, and Jimi Tenor on the Numan tribute album &quot;Random.&quot; Terre Thaemlitz recorded two instrumental versions of &quot;Down in the Park&quot; on the tribute album &quot;Replicas Rubato&quot;, one on piano and the other on synthesiser (the latter a hidden track). Curve did a cover version also sung by Garry Numan, who appears as a guest vocalist. Other tribute acts to have recorded the song include Bytet and Reload, on the albums &quot;Ghost of a White Face Clown&quot; and &quot;Tubeway Navy&quot; respectively. On various dates of the 2009 Nine Inch Nails Wave Goodbye Tour, Trent Reznor and his band performed a version featuring Gary Numan on vocals and David Bowie collaborator, Mike Garson, on grand piano. In 2021, German electronic band Blutengel included a cover on the album &quot;Fountain of Destiny&quot;.

==Live performances==
&quot;Down in the Park&quot; has been a mainstay of Numan&#x27;s concerts since his 1979 tour, and appears on almost all of his live albums. An arrangement with solo piano introduction appeared on the &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;80&quot; LP, in the movie &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot;, and in the &quot;Micromusic&quot; video concert from Wembley Arena (soundtrack released as &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;81&quot;). A version for piano alone was the flip side of Numan&#x27;s single &quot;I Die: You Die&quot; in 1980 (and was also included as a bonus track on the 1998 CD re-issue of &quot;Telekon&quot;). The original song was remixed twice for the 2003 collection &quot;Hybrid&quot;, and a demo version of the song was included on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Times Square&quot; (1980).

<doc id="264351" wikidata="Q2860768" url="?curid=264351" title="Are &quot;Friends&quot; Electric?">
<text>&quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; is a 1979 song by the English band Tubeway Army. Taken from their album &quot;Replicas&quot;, it was released as a single in May 1979 and reached number one in the UK Singles Chart, staying there for four weeks. It was written and produced by Gary Numan, the band&#x27;s frontman and lead vocalist. It was also the band&#x27;s last single before breaking up.

==Music and production==
&quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; was originally written on an old out-of-tune pub piano. It was initially two different songs that were combined. Numan recorded it on a Polymoog synthesizer with conventional bass and drums.

The song features three different sections: a recurring verse with a synth riff in C and B flat, a recurring section with spoken word over slow arpeggiated seventh chords, and an instrumental break in F. The instrumentation is quite minimal: a conventional drum and bass guitar backing track, some additional heavily flanged guitar (particularly in the instrumental break), subdued vocals and, most prominently, Minimoog and Polymoog synthesisers. These synth parts include portamento background lines.

Numan stumbled upon synthesisers by accident. While intending to record a punk album, he noticed a Minimoog synthesiser that had been left in the studio.

In a 2014 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Numan commented on the song&#x27;s lyrics:

==Release==
&quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; was released as a limited edition picture disc of 20,000 copies in May 1979. The B-side of the single was a more rock-oriented number, &quot;We Are So Fragile&quot;. A song that was performed on Numan&#x27;s 1979 &quot;Touring Principle&quot; series of concerts and appears on the album &quot;Living Ornaments &#x27;79&quot;. The song was covered by bis on the compilation album &quot;Random&quot;.

The single entered the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart at a modest No. 71, steadily climbing to No. 1 at the end of June and remained on that position for four consecutive weeks.

==Reception==
Despite being over five minutes long and possessing, in the words of its composer, &quot;no recognisable hook-line whatsoever&quot;, the single topped the UK charts in mid-1979. Whilst the track&#x27;s distinctive sound stood out at the time, sales also benefited from the record company&#x27;s use of a picture disc and Numan&#x27;s striking, &quot;robotic&quot; performance on the TV shows &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Smash Hits&quot; in 1979, Cliff White described the song as &quot;a dark, threatening wall of synthesised sound&quot; which &quot;throbbed ominously behind a gloomy song of paranoia and loneliness&quot;. White went on to say it was &quot;gripping stuff, but cheerful it isn&#x27;t&quot;.

The song has retrospectively been described as &quot;an atmospheric, almost frigid-sounding monologue spliced over creepy after-dark synthesizers&quot; that &quot;had not a hook or chorus in sight&quot;.

==Live versions==
&quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; has been a mainstay of Numan&#x27;s concerts since its release and appears on all ten of his official live recordings to date. A semi-acoustic version appeared on the 2006 &quot;Jagged&quot; tour set list.

==Cover versions and sampling==

The song was sampled by Richard X in a song titled &quot;We Don&#x27;t Give a Damn About Our Friends&quot; as a mashup with vocals from Adina Howard&#x27;s &quot;Freak like Me&quot;, which the Sugababes then recorded under the latter title and achieved a number one UK hit in 2002 (Numan considered this track to be better than &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot;).

The song was covered by Information Society on their 1997 album &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot;, by American rock band Weezer alongside their 2008 single &quot;Pork and Beans&quot;, and the Dead Weather for the B-side of their 2009 debut single &quot;Hang You from the Heavens&quot;.

The song was also sampled by Kryder and the Cube Guys in their 2016 single, &quot;You &amp; Me&quot;. In 2018, Kevin Max covered the song for his concept album &quot;Romeo Drive&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The song was featured in the 2006 video game &quot;Need for Speed: Carbon&quot;. It plays whenever the player is using a car in the tuner class.

<doc id="264353" wikidata="Q369767" url="?curid=264353" title="Barrow's goldeneye">
<text>Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye (Bucephala islandica) is a medium-sized sea duck of the genus &quot;Bucephala&quot;, the goldeneyes. This bird was named after Sir John Barrow. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;boukephalos&quot;, &quot;bullheaded&quot;, from &quot;bous&quot;, &quot;bull&quot; and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head&quot;, a reference to the bulbous head shape of the bufflehead. The species name &quot;islandica&quot; means Iceland.

==Taxonomy==
Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Anas islandica&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Hravn Oend&quot; that had been briefly described in 1776 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller. Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye is now placed with the common goldeneye and the bufflehead in the genus &quot;Bucephala&quot; that was introduced in 1858 by American naturalist Spencer Baird. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;boukephalos&quot;, meaning &quot;bullheaded&quot;, from &quot;bous&quot; &quot;bull&quot;, and &quot;kephale&quot;, &quot;head. The specific epithet &quot;islandica&quot; is for Iceland. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Adults are similar in appearance to the common goldeneye. On average, adult males are long and weigh ; females are typically long and weigh . The Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye has a wingspan of 27.6–28.7 in (70–73 cm). Adult males have a dark head with a purplish gloss and a white crescent at the front of the face. Adult females have a mostly yellow bill. The male Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye differs from the male common goldeneye in the fact that the common goldeneye has a round white patches on the face, less black on the back of the bird, a greenish gloss, and a larger bill. For the females, the common goldeneye has a less rounded head, and a bill in which only the tip is yellow.

===Vocalizations===
The Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye is a relatively quiet bird that generally only makes vocalizations during the breeding season and courtship. These can include low volume squeaks, grunts and croaks. During flights, the fast movement of the bird&#x27;s wings creates a low whistling sound.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat consists of wooded lakes and ponds primarily in northwestern North America, but also in scattered locations in eastern Canada and Iceland. Females return to the same breeding sites year after year and also tend to use the same nesting sites. The males stay with their mate through the winter and defend their territory during the breeding season, then leave for the molting site. Mating pairs often stay intact even though the male and female are apart for long periods of time over the summer during molting times. The pair then reunites at wintering areas.

In Iceland the bird is known as húsönd (house-duck); it is a common species of the Lake Mývatn in the north of the country.

There have been three records of vagrants from Scotland, the only records of this species accepted as wild in Europe outside of Iceland.

==Behavior==
They are migratory and most winter in protected coastal waters or open inland waters. Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye, along with many other species of sea ducks, rely on urbanized, coastal estuaries as important places on their migration patterns. These estuaries provide excellent wintering and stopping places during the ducks&#x27; migration. It is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe and to southern North America.

These diving birds forage underwater. They eat aquatic insects, crustaceans and pond vegetation. The main staples of the bird&#x27;s diet are &quot;Gammarus oceanicus&quot; and &quot;Calliopius laeviusculus&quot;, which are both marine crustaceans. A large part of their diet consists of mussels and gastropods.

The Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye is considered an arboreal bird species because much of its nesting is done in cavities found in mature trees. The birds will also nest in burrows or protected sites on the ground. Barrow&#x27;s goldeneyes tend not to share habitat with the much more numerous common goldeneye. Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye tend to be territorial towards other birds venturing into their domain. This is especially true among the drakes. Confrontations may occur in the form of fighting. Drakes often do a form of territorial display along the boundaries of their territory. This is both true on land and in the water. These territorial displays average about 6 minutes in length and often trigger other males to perform their own show.

===Breeding===

Very little is known about the breeding sites and patterns of the Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye. After the breeding season, the birds migrate to specific molting sites to undergo molting, the loss and regeneration of feathers which causes them to be flightless for anywhere from 20–40 days. These molting sites are often wetlands that are more drought resistant and plentiful in food, along with being less influenced by humans and predators.

==1989 &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill==
The Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye was greatly affected by the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill in 1989. The spill greatly impacted the bird&#x27;s wintering areas, and numbers of the birds in these areas decreased after the spill. The birds&#x27; exposure to the oil spill mainly occurred in the shallow water mussel beds along the coast.

<text>The Elopiformes are the order of ray-finned fish including the tarpons, tenpounders, and ladyfish, as well as a number of extinct types. They have a long fossil record, easily distinguished from other fishes by the presence of an additional set of bones in the throat.

They are related to the order of eels, although the adults superficially resemble very large or giant herrings in appearance. The larvae, however, are leptocephalic, looking very similar to those of eels.

==Classification==
Although many fossil forms are known, the order is relatively small today, containing just two genera and nine species:

<text>The oldest surviving Hebrew Bible manuscripts, the Dead Sea Scrolls, date to . Some of these scrolls are presently stored at the Shrine of the Book in Jerusalem. The oldest text of the entire Christian Bible, including the New Testament, is the Codex Sinaiticus dating from the 4th century CE, with its Old Testament a copy of a Greek translation known as the Septuagint. The oldest extant manuscripts of the vocalized Masoretic Text date to the 9th century CE. With the exception of a few biblical sections in the Nevi&#x27;im, virtually no biblical text is contemporaneous with the events it describes.

Internal evidence within the texts of the 27-book New Testament canon suggests that most of these books were written in the 1st century CE. The first book written is thought to be either the Epistle to the Galatians (written around 48 CE) or 1 Thessalonians, written around 50 CE. The final book in the ordering of the canon, the Book of Revelation, is generally accepted by traditional scholarship to have been written during the reign of Domitian (81–96) before the writing of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus and the Epistles of John. Dating the composition of the texts relies primarily on internal evidence, including direct references to historical events. Textual criticism, as well as epigraphic analysis of biblical manuscripts, provides further evidence that scholars consider when judging the relative age of sections of the Bible.

==Table I: Chronological overview==
This table summarises the chronology of the main tables and serves as a guide to the historical periods mentioned. Much of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament may have been assembled in the 5th century BCE. The New Testament books were composed largely in the second half of the 1st century CE. The deuterocanonical books fall largely in between.

<text>Li Ruihuan (born September 17, 1934) is a Chinese retired politician. Li was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), China&#x27;s top decision-making body, between 1989 and 2002. Li served as Chairman of the 9th National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from 1993 to 2003; before that, he was the CCP secretary of Tianjin.

==Biography==
A native of a peasant family in Baodi, Tianjin, and originally a carpenter by trade, he was elected and reelected chairman of the 8th and 9th CPPCC National Committees in March 1993 and March 1998. Li Ruihuan is the sixth chairman of the CPPCC after Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Deng Yingchao, and Li Xiannian. Since this post has been held by some of the most prominent revolutionary elders, it is spoken of &quot;noble and sacred&quot; by reverent observers. The principal duties of the CPPCC chief are mainly advisory and conciliatory; Li&#x27;s duties focused on mitigating conflict between different sectors of society, conferring on state affairs, and providing ideas for the top bodies of PRC central government for reference.

Li, born into ordinary peasant family in September 1934; worked as a construction worker in Beijing Third Construction Company from 1951 until 1965 and in his spare-time attended the architecture engineering institute; and received a college certificate. Li is known as the inventor of the &quot;simplified calculation method,&quot; which updated the traditional &quot;lofting method&quot; in carpentry, Li was known as &quot;young Lu Ban,&quot; a legendary master carpenter in ancient China. He rose up the ranks of the construction industry and Tianjin politics.

During his tenure of office as Tianjin mayor, he actively supported institutional restructuring, focusing attention on improving urban housing and public transport conditions. He gained great popularity among Tianjin residents with his call-in radio and television programs through which he directly answered residents&#x27; inquires in concrete terms.

In 1989, he became a member of the Politburo Standing Committee with Jiang Zemin and Song Ping, and became the chairman of CPPCC in 1993. Li Ruihuan retired in 2003 aged 68. He reappeared at the 20th Party Congress on 16 October 2022.

<text>Martin Van Buren Bates (November 9, 1837 – January 19, 1919), known as the Kentucky Giant, was an American man famous for his great height. He was tall and weighed .

==Youth and growth==
Bates&#x27; growth rate jumped at the age of six or seven. At age 12 he was over tall and weighed over .

==American Civil War==
Bates was attending university in Virginia when the American Civil War broke out. He subsequently joined the 5th Kentucky Infantry Confederate States Army, later becoming a lieutenant and then captain. He was severely wounded in a battle near the Cumberland Gap and was captured and imprisoned at Camp Chase in Ohio, although he later escaped.

==Adulthood and first marriage==
He returned to Kentucky after the war. Before the war, his first occupation was as a schoolteacher. While the circus was on tour in Halifax, Canada, the tall Anna Haining Swan visited. She and Martin soon got to know each other, and were married in 1871. The highly publicized wedding, at St. Martin-in-the-Fields in London, England, drew thousands of people trying to attend, due to both the uncommonness of the spectacle and the couple&#x27;s disarming good nature. Queen Victoria gave Bates an engraved watch, and gave Swan a satin gown and diamond ring.

They moved to Ohio in 1872, settling in Seville. On May 19, 1872, Anna gave birth to a daughter, who weighed and died at birth. They built a large house to accommodate themselves comfortably. Martin described the next few years in his autobiography:

==Final years==
Anna Bates died on August 5, 1888. Martin ordered a statue of her from Europe for her grave, sold the oversized house, and moved into the town. In 1889 he remarried, this time to a woman of typical stature, Annette LaVonne Weatherby, and lived a mostly peaceful life until his death in 1919 of nephritis. He was buried beside his first wife and their son in Seville. He is one of the tallest known people to live to at least 80 years.

Some years after his death, a family of typical heights had purchased the 14-ft ceiling home built by the giant couple. However, the original house in which he and Anna lived burnt down. Later a standard house was built on that site and eventually converted into a museum for the Seville Historical Society.

<doc id="264373" wikidata="Q18891017" url="?curid=264373" title="Steering">
<text>Steering is the control of the direction of motion or the components that enable its control. Steering is achieved through various arrangements, among them ailerons for airplanes, rudders for boats, cylic tilting of rotors for helicopters, and many more.

== Aircraft ==
Aircraft flight control systems are normally steered when airborne by the use of ailerons, spoileron, or both to bank the aircraft into a turn; although the rudder can also be used to turn the aircraft, it is usually used to minimize adverse yaw, rather than as a means to directly cause the turn. On the ground, aircraft are generally steered at low speeds by turning the nosewheel or tailwheel (using a tiller or the rudder pedals) or through differential braking, and by the rudder at high speeds. Missiles, airships and large hovercraft are usually steered by a rudder, thrust vectoring, or both. Small sport hovercraft have similar rudders, but steer mostly by the pilot shifting their weight from side to side and unbalancing the more powerful lift forces beneath the skirt. Jet packs and flying platforms are steered by thrust vectoring only.

Helicopter flight controls are steered by cyclic control, changing the thrust vector of the main rotor(s), and by anti-torque control, usually provided by a tail rotor.

== Automotive ==

A conventional automotive steering arrangement allows a driver to control the direction of the vehicle by turning the direction of the front wheels using a hand–operated steering wheel positioned in front of the driver. The steering wheel is attached to a steering column, which is linked to rods, pivots and gears that allow the driver to change the direction of the front wheels. The mechanism may include a rack and pinion mechanism that converts several turns of the steering wheel into a large linear displacement. Alternatively, it may use a recirculating ball system. The mechanism may be power-assisted, usually by hydraulic or electrical means.

The use of a variable rack (still using a normal pinion) was invented by Arthur Ernest Bishop in the 1970s, so as to improve vehicle response and aim to allow for more comfortable steering, especially at high speeds. He also created a low cost press forging process to manufacture the racks, eliminating the need to machine the gear teeth.

Other arrangements are sometimes found on different types of vehicles; for example, a tiller or rear-wheel steering. Tracked vehicles such as bulldozers and tanks usually employ differential steering, where the tracks are made to move at different speeds or in opposite directions, using the clutch and brakes, to achieve a change of direction.

Common steering system components include:
* Steering wheel
* Steering column
* Steering box
* Pitman arm
* Idler arm
* Tie rod ends
* Rack and pinion
* Power steering pump
* Power steering fluid
* Steering linkage
* Steering knuckle
* Ball joints
* Steering dampers
===Geometry===

The basic aim of steering is to ensure that the wheels are pointing in the desired direction to move the vehicle as required. This is typically achieved by a series of linkages, rods, pivots, and gears. One of the fundamental concepts is that of caster angle. Each wheel is steered with a pivot point ahead of the wheel, which tends to make the steering self-centered in the direction of travel.

The steering linkages connecting the steering box and the wheels usually conform to a variation of Ackermann steering geometry, to account for the fact that in a turn, the inner wheel travels in a path of smaller radius than the outer wheel, so that the degree of toe suitable for driving in a straight path is not suitable for turns. The angle the wheels make in the vertical plane, known as camber angle, also influences steering dynamics as do the tires.

Steering wheel turning is often measured in terms of number of full 360-degree turns to go lock-to-lock. This is when the steering input mechanism is restrained at its mechanical limit from the full right-turn stop to the left-turn stop.

===Rack and pinion, recirculating ball, worm and sector===

Many modern cars have a steering mechanism called a rack and pinion. The steering wheel turns a pinion gear, which moves a rack back and forth to steer the wheels. This mechanism converts the circular motion of the steering wheel to linear motion, which is applied to the wheels of the car via tie rods and a steering knuckle.

Rack and pinion steering has several advantages, such as a direct steering &quot;feel&quot;. This means that the driver can feel the road better and have more precise control over the car&#x27;s movement.

BMW was one of the first manufacturers to adopt rack and pinion steering systems in the 1930s, with many other European manufacturers following suit. Auto manufacturers in the United States began to use rack and pinion steering with the 1974 Ford Pinto.

Older designs use two main principles: the worm and sector design and the screw and nut. Both types were enhanced by reducing the friction; for screw and nut it is the recirculating ball mechanism, which is still found on trucks and utility vehicles. The steering column turns a large screw, which meshes with the nut by recirculating balls. The nut moves a sector of a gear, causing it to rotate about its axis as the screw is turned; an arm attached to the axis of the sector moves the pitman arm, which is connected to the steering linkage and thus steers the wheels. The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the screw and the nut. At either end of the apparatus, the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box, which connects them with the other end of the apparatus. Thus, they are &quot;recirculated&quot;.

The recirculating ball mechanism gives a driver a greater mechanical advantage, resulting in its use on larger, heavier vehicles, while the rack and pinion would originally be limited to smaller and lighter ones; due to the almost universal adoption of power steering, however, this is no longer considered an important advantage, leading to the increasing use of rack and pinion mechanisms on newer cars. The recirculating ball design also has a perceptible lash, or &quot;dead spot&quot; on center, where a minute turn of the steering wheel in either direction does not move the steering apparatus; this is easily adjustable via a screw on the end of the steering box to account for wear, but it cannot be eliminated because it will produce excessive internal forces at other positions and the mechanism will wear very rapidly. This design is still in use in trucks and other large vehicles, where rapidity of steering and direct feel are less important than robustness, maintainability, and mechanical advantage.

The worm and sector was an older design, used for example in Willys and Chrysler vehicles, and the Ford Falcon (1960s). To reduce friction, the sector is replaced by a roller or rotating pins on the rocker shaft arm.

Generally, older vehicles use the recirculating ball mechanism, and only newer vehicles use rack-and-pinion steering. This division is not very strict, however, and rack-and-pinion steering systems can be found on British sports cars of the mid-1950s, and some German carmakers did not give up recirculating ball technology until the early 1990s.

Other systems for steering exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children&#x27;s toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage in the form of a bellcrank (also commonly known as a pitman arm) attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms, and the use of cable-operated steering linkages (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.

===Power steering===
Power steering helps the driver of a vehicle to steer by directing some of its engine power to assist in swiveling the steered road wheels about their steering axes. As vehicles have become heavier and switched to front-wheel drive, particularly using negative offset geometry, along with increases in tire width and diameter, the effort needed to turn the wheels about their steering axis has increased, often to the point where major physical exertion would be needed were it not for power assistance. To alleviate this, auto makers have developed power steering systems, or more correctly power-assisted steering, since on road-going vehicles there has to be a mechanical linkage as a fail-safe. There are two types of power steering systems: hydraulic and electric/electronic. A hydraulic-electric hybrid system is also possible.

A Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric Power Steering (EPS) is more efficient than hydraulic power-steering, since the electric power-steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of the environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of hydraulic power-steering fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas hydraulic assistance stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.

===Speed-sensitive steering===
Speed-sensitive steering allows for highly assisted steering at low speeds for maneuverability, and lightly assisted steering at high speed for stability. The first vehicle with this feature was the Citroën SM with its DIRAVI system, first sold in France in 1970. The hydraulic steering system applied force on a centering cam which pushed the steering rack and wheel back to the straight-ahead position. The centering force increased with speed, requiring more effort to turn the wheel at greater speeds.

Modern speed-sensitive power steering systems reduce the mechanical or electrical assistance as the vehicle speed increases, giving a more direct feel. This feature is gradually becoming more common. For example, it was used on a production pickup truck, the Tesla Cybertruck, in 2023.

===Four-wheel steering===
Four-wheel steering is a system employed by some vehicles to improve steering response, increase vehicle stability while maneuvering at high speed, or to decrease turning radius at low speed.

====Active four-wheel steering====
In an active four-wheel steering system, all four wheels turn at the same time when the driver steers. In most active four-wheel steering systems, the rear wheels are steered by a computer and actuators. The rear wheels generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels. There can be controls to switch off the rear steering and options to steer only the rear wheels independently of the front wheels. At low speed (e.g. parking) the rear wheels turn opposite to the front wheels, reducing the turning radius, sometimes critical for large trucks, tractors, vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase, while at higher speeds both front and rear wheels turn alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build-up of the lateral acceleration, enhancing straight-line stability. The &quot;snaking effect&quot; experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified.

Four-wheel steering found its most widespread use in monster trucks, where maneuverability in small arenas is critical, and it is also popular in large farm vehicles and trucks. Some of the modern European Intercity buses also utilize four-wheel steering to assist maneuverability in bus terminals, and also to improve road stability. Mazda were pioneers in applying four-wheel steering to automobiles, showing it on their 1984 Mazda MX-02 concept car, where the rear wheels counter-steered at low speeds. Mazda proceeded to offer a version of this electronic four-wheel steering system on the Mazda 626 and MX6 in 1988. The first rally vehicle to use the technology was the Peugeot 405 Turbo 16, which debuted at the 1988 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb.

Previously, Honda had mechanical four-wheel steering as an option in their 1987–2001 Prelude and Honda Ascot models (1989–1996) later upgrading to electronically controlled. General Motors offered Delphi&#x27;s Quadrasteer in their Silverado/Sierra and Suburban/Yukon. Due to low demand, GM discontinued the technology at the end of the 2005 model year. Nissan/Infiniti offer several versions of their HICAS system as standard or as an option in much of their line-up.

In the early 2000s, a new generation of four-wheel steering systems was introduced into the market. In 2001 BMW equipped the E65 7 series with an all-wheel steering system (optional, called &#x27;Integral Active Steering&#x27;), which is available on the current 5, 6, and 7 series, as an option. Renault introduced an optional all-wheel steering called &#x27;4control&#x27; in 2009, at first on the Laguna GT, which is currently available on the Talisman, Mégane and Espace vehicle lines. In 2013, Porsche introduced a system on the 911 Turbo as standard equipment. Since 2016, the Panamera has been offered with optional all-wheel steering. The 2014 Audi Q7 was launched with an optional system. Also the Japanese OEMs offer luxury segment vehicles equipped with all-wheel steering, such as Infiniti on its QX70 model (&#x27;Rear Active Steering&#x27;) and Lexus on the GS. Italian manufacturers have launched the technology in the model years 2016–17 with the Ferrari F12tdf, the Ferrari GTC4Lusso as well as the Lamborghini Aventador S.

=====Crab steering=====
Crab steering is a special type of active four-wheel steering. It operates by steering all wheels in the same direction and at the same angle. Crab steering is used when the vehicle needs to proceed in a straight line but at an angle: when changing lanes on a highway at speed, when moving loads with a reach truck, or during filming with a camera dolly.

Rear wheel steering can also be used when the rear wheels may not follow the path taken by the front wheel tracks (e.g. to reduce soil compaction when using rolling farm equipment).

==== Passive rear-wheel steering====
Many modern vehicles have passive rear-wheel steering. On many vehicles, when cornering, the rear wheels tend to steer slightly to the outside of a turn, which can reduce stability. The passive steering system uses the lateral forces generated in a turn (through suspension geometry) and the bushings to correct this tendency and steer the wheels slightly to the inside of the corner. This improves the stability of the car through the turn. This effect is called compliance understeer; it, or its opposite, is present on all suspensions. Typical methods of achieving compliance understeer are to use a Watt&#x27;s link on a live rear axle, or the use of toe control bushings on a twist beam suspension. On an independent rear suspension it is normally achieved by changing the rates of the rubber bushings in the suspension. Some suspensions typically have compliance oversteer due to geometry, such as Hotchkiss live axles, semi-trailing arm IRS, and rear twist beams, but may be mitigated by revisions to the pivot points of the leaf spring or trailing arm, or additional suspension links, or complex internal geometry of the bushings.

Passive rear-wheel steering is not a new concept, as it has been in use for many years, although not always recognized as such.

===Articulated steering===

Articulated steering is a system by which a vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge. The front and rear halves are connected with one or more hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle. This system does not use steering arms, king pins, tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering. If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential in four-wheel drive vehicles, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed. Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance.

Vehicle-trailer-combinations such as semi-trailers, road trains, articulated buses, and internal transport trolley trains can be regarded as passively-articulated vehicles.
===Rear-wheel steering===
A few types of vehicle use only rear-wheel steering, notably fork lift trucks, camera dollies, early pay loaders, Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion car, and the ThrustSSC.

Rear wheel steering is particularly useful for tight maneuvring. 
However naive implementations of rear-wheel steering tend to oversteer which may lead to steering instability. Therefore rear-wheel steering usually only found in slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.

For heavy haulage or for increased maneuverability, some semi-trailers are fitted with rear-wheel steering, controlled electro-hydraulically. The wheels on all or some of the rear axles may be turned through different angles to enable tighter cornering, or through the same angle (crab steering) to move the rear of the trailer laterally.

===Steer-by-wire===

The aim of steer-by-wire technology is to completely remove as many mechanical components (steering shaft, column, gear reduction mechanism, etc.) as possible. Completely replacing conventional steering system with steer-by-wire has several advantages, such as:
* The absence of steering column simplifies the car interior design.
* The absence of steering shaft, column and gear reduction mechanism allows much better space utilization in the engine compartment.
* The steering mechanism can be designed and installed as a modular unit.
* Without mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the road wheel, it is less likely that the impact of a frontal crash will cause the steering wheel to impact the driver.
* Steering system characteristics can easily be adjusted to change the steering response and feel.

Steer-by-wire without the use of a steering column was first offered in a production car with the Nissan Infiniti Q50 in 2013. Steer-by-wire continued to be offered with the QX50 and QX55, and as of 2022 is being offered with the Infiniti Q60 coupe.

Production battery electric vehicles in the 2020s that offer steer-by-wire with no steering column include the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle, Lexus RZ 450e, REE Automotive P7-module-based vehicles, Toyota bZ4X, and Tesla Cybertruck. As of 2023 Lotus, Peugeot, and Mercedes-Benz plan to offer steer-by-wire cars in the mid to late 2020s.

===Safety===

Traditionally, cars feature a collapsible steering column (energy absorbing steering column) which will collapse in the event of a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver. Airbags are also generally fitted as standard. Non-collapsible steering columns fitted to older vehicles very often impaled drivers in frontal crashes, particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line, at the front of the crumple zone. This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame with no crumple zone. Many modern vehicle steering boxes or racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead, at the rear of the front crumple zone.

Collapsible steering columns were invented by Béla Barényi and were introduced in the 1959 Mercedes-Benz W111 Fintail, along with crumple zones. This safety feature first appeared on cars built by General Motors after an extensive and very public lobbying campaign enacted by Ralph Nader. Ford started to install collapsible steering columns in 1968.

Audi used a retractable steering wheel and seat belt tensioning system called procon-ten, but it has since been discontinued in favor of airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pre-tensioners.

===Cycles===
See the section § Bicycles.

===Differential steering===

Differential steering is the primary means of steering tracked vehicles, such as tanks and bulldozers; it is also used in certain wheeled vehicles commonly known as skid-steers, and implemented in some automobiles, where it is called torque vectoring, to augment steering by changing wheel direction relative to the vehicle.

===Regulations===

* In the European Union, Russia and Japan, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) vehicle regulation 79 is related to steering.
* In the United States, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 203 and 204 are related to impact protection for the driver from the steering control system and steering control rearward displacement while 49 Code of Federal Regulations § 393.209 is related to steering wheel systems.
* In North America, &quot;hands-off&quot; or &quot;hands-free&quot; level-2 systems allowing the drivers to remove both hands from the steering wheel were introduced and legally permitted. General Motors&#x27; Super Cruise is such an implementation. In those designs warnings are raised when driver disengages his/her visual attention.
* In May 2023, in Europe, UNECE regulation 79 still requires assistant systems for steering to prompt drivers not to remove their hands from the steering wheel. Those systems are known as &quot;hands-on&quot; systems. With &quot;hands-on&quot; assisted driving systems, British and European drivers are required by the system itself to keep one or both hands on the steering wheel, as with unassisted driving: When driving with assisted steering, if drivers remove both hands from the steering wheel, an optical warning occurs after the first 15 seconds and an acoustic warning occurs after 15 more seconds. Assisted steering is deactivated after additional 30 seconds.
* In the United Kingdom, drivers must control the vehicle at all times, and Rule 160 of the Highway Code instructs to &quot;drive with both hands on the wheel where possible.&quot; and to &quot;use (ADAS) according to the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions.&quot;

== Bicycles ==
The bicycle is steered by turning the handlebar and by the lean of the rider and the bicycle:

* Turning the handlebar rotates the front wheel with respect to the plane of the circumference of the rear wheel. Friction of the front wheel with the ground provides the lateral forces that steer the bicycle. Modern bicycles have the front-wheel ground-contact-point trailing behind the steering axis, which is the long axis of the bicycle fork through the center of the front wheel. This trailing contact point adds to the effects of inertia and center-of-mass offset which affect the steering and self-stability of the bicycle.
* Leaning the frame of the bicycle, which displaces the rider and parts of the bicycle in relation to the axis along the ground contact points of the wheels. Gravitational forces then provide the lateral forces that steer the bicycle.

== Watercraft ==
Ships and boats are usually steered with a rudder. Depending on the size of the vessel, rudders can be manually actuated, or operated using a servomechanism, or a trim tab or servo tab system. Rowing may be used to steer rowboats by using specific paddle strokes. Boats using outboard motors steer by rotating the entire drive unit. Boats with inboard motors sometimes steer by rotating the propeller pod only (i.e., Volvo Penta IPS drive). Steering wheels may be used to control the rudder or propeller. Modern ships with diesel-electric drive use azimuth thrusters. Boats powered by oars or paddles are steered by generating a higher propulsion force on the side of the boat opposite of the direction of turn. Jet skis are steered by weight-shift induced roll and water jet thrust vectoring.

The rudder of a vessel can steer the ship only when water is passing over it. Hence, when a ship is not moving relative to the water it is in or cannot move its rudder, it does not respond to the helm and is said to have &quot;lost steerage&quot;. The motion of a ship through the water is known as &quot;making way&quot;. Boats on rivers must always be under propulsion, even when traveling downstream, in order to steer, requiring sufficient water to pass over the surface of the rudder to effect changes in the direction of the boat in response to the helm. This is called having &quot;steerage way&quot;.

<text>Anna Haining Bates (née Swan; August 6, 1846 – August 5, 1888) was a Canadian woman notable for her great stature of . She was one of the tallest women who ever lived. Her parents were of average height and were Scottish immigrants.

==Early life==
Anna Swan was born at Mill Brook, New Annan, Nova Scotia. At birth she weighed . She was the third of 13 children, all of the others being around average height. From birth she grew very rapidly. Anna&#x27;s mother recalled that her daughter&#x27;s growth rate was &quot;Phenomenal&quot;. On her fourth birthday she was tall and weighed . On her 6th birthday she was measured at tall, an inch or two (2.5–5 cm) shorter than her mother. On her 10th birthday she measured tall and weighed at . 

On her 11th birthday, she was measured at tall. On her 15th birthday Swan was measured at tall. She reached her full height three years later. Her feet were long.

Swan excelled at literature and music and was considered to be very intelligent. She also excelled at her studies of acting, piano and voice. On one occasion she played Lady Macbeth.

==Circus career==
When she was 17, Swan started working with American showman P. T. Barnum. She lived in Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York City, and on July 13, 1865 she nearly burned to death when the museum was destroyed by fire. The stairs were in flames and she was too large to escape through a window. At the time she weighed 384 lb. (159 kg). Her highest recorded weight was 418 lb or just under 30 stones. She got help and escaped safely.

Swan later toured the western United States, followed by Europe where she appeared before Queen Victoria. When visiting a circus in Halifax with which Martin Van Buren Bates—another enormously tall person known as the &quot;Kentucky Giant&quot;—was travelling, Swan was spotted by the promoter and hired on the spot. The giant couple became a touring sensation and eventually fell in love; they married on June 17, 1871, in St Martin-in-the-Fields in London. Queen Victoria gave Anna a satin gown and diamond ring, and gave Martin an engraved watch.

==Children==

Bates conceived two children with Martin. The first was a girl born on May 19, 1872; she weighed and died at birth. While touring in the summer of 1878, Anna was pregnant for the second time. The boy was born on January 18, 1879, and survived only 11 hours. Named just &quot;Babe&quot; he was said by his father to have had the appearance of a perfect 6-month-old. He was the largest newborn ever recorded, at and 28 inches tall (c. 72 cm); each of his feet was long. He was posthumously awarded a Guinness World Record as the heaviest new-born baby and the longest.

==Later life==

The Bateses retired to Seville, Ohio, where they built a mansion with high ceilings and door frames. The main part of the house had ceilings, while the doors were extra wide and were tall. The back part of the house was built an average size for servants and guests.

They resumed touring with the W. W. Cole Circus in the summer of 1879, and again in the spring of 1880, which was her final ever tour. After that, Bates spent her remaining years quietly on the farm that she and her husband owned. She had joined the local Baptist Church in 1877 and attended services with her husband until shortly before her death.

==Death==

Anna Bates died suddenly and unexpectedly of heart failure in her sleep at her home on August 5, 1888, one day before her 42nd birthday.

The cause of her height was never discovered in her lifetime. X-rays were not discovered until 1895, so it could not be ascertained if she had a pituitary tumor.

<doc id="264379" wikidata="Q151121" url="?curid=264379" title="Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport">
<text>Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport is a public international airport located in Boone County, Kentucky, United States, around the community of Hebron. The airport serves the Cincinnati tri-state area. The airport&#x27;s code, CVG, is derived from the nearest city at the time of the airport&#x27;s opening, Covington, Kentucky. The airport covers an area of . It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2023–2027, in which it is categorized as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility.

Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport offers nonstop passenger service to over 50 destinations in North America and Europe, handling numerous domestic and international cargo flights every day. The airport is a cargo global hub for Amazon Air, Atlas Air, ABX Air, Kalitta Air, and DHL Aviation. The airport is currently the 6th busiest airport in the United States by cargo traffic and 12th largest in the world. CVG is the fastest-growing cargo airport in North America.

==History==
===Beginnings===
President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration approved preliminary funds for site development of the Greater Cincinnati Airport on February 11, 1942. This was part of the United States Army Air Corps program to establish training facilities during World War II. At the time, air traffic in the area centered on Lunken Airport just southeast of central Cincinnati. Lunken opened in 1926 in the Ohio River Valley; it frequently experienced fog, and the 1937 flood submerged its runways and two-story terminal building. Federal officials wanted an airfield site that would not be prone to flooding, but Cincinnati officials hoped to build Lunken into the region&#x27;s main airport.

Officials from Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties in Kentucky took advantage of Cincinnati&#x27;s short-sightedness and lobbied Congress to build an airfield there. Boone County officials offered a suitable site on the provision that Kenton County paid the acquisition cost. In October 1942, Congress provided $2 million to build four runways.

The field opened August 12, 1944, with the first B-17 bombers beginning practice runs on August 15. As the tide of the war had already turned, the Air Corps only used the field until it was declared surplus in 1945. However, this was not before the first regularly scheduled air freight shipment in the United States arrived in mid-September, signalling the future importance of the airport.

On October 27, 1946, a small wooden terminal building opened and the airport prepared for commercial service under the name Greater Cincinnati Airport. Boone County Airlines was the first airline to provide scheduled service from the airport and had its headquarters at the airport.

The first commercial flight, an American Airlines DC-3 from Cleveland, landed on January 10, 1947, at 9:53 am. A Delta Air Lines flight followed moments later. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 97 weekday departures: 37 American, 26 Delta, 24 TWA, 8 Piedmont, and 2 Lake Central. As late as November 1959 the airport had four runways at 45-degree angles, the north–south runway eventually being extended into today&#x27;s runway 18C/36C.

In the 1950s Cincinnati city leaders began pushing for expansion of a site in Blue Ash to both compete with the Greater Cincinnati Airport and replace Lunken as the city&#x27;s primary airport. The city purchased Hugh Watson Field in 1955, turning it into Blue Ash Airport. The city&#x27;s Blue Ash plans were hampered by community opposition, three failed Hamilton County bond measures, political infighting, and Cincinnati&#x27;s decision not to participate in the federal airfield program.

===Jet age===

On December 16, 1960, the jet age arrived in Cincinnati when a Delta Air Lines Convair 880 from Miami completed the first scheduled jet flight. The airport needed to expand and build more modern terminals and other facilities; the original Terminal A was expanded and renovated. The north–south runway was extended from . In 1964, the board approved a $12 million bond to expand the south concourse of Terminal A by and provide nine gates for TWA, American, and Delta. A new east–west runway crossing the longer north–south runway was constructed in 1971 south of the older east–west runway.

In 1977, before the Airline Deregulation Act was passed, CVG, like many small airports, anticipated the loss of numerous flights; creating the opportunity for Patrick Sowers, Robert Tranter, and David and Raymound Mueller to establish Comair to fill the void. The airline began service to Akron/Canton, Cleveland, and Evansville. In 1981, Comair became a public company, added 30-seat turboprops to its fleet, and began to rapidly expand its destinations. In 1984, Comair became a Delta Connection carrier with Delta&#x27;s establishment of a hub at CVG. That same year, Comair introduced its first international flights from Cincinnati to Toronto. In 1992, Comair moved into Concourse C, as Delta Air Lines gradually continued to acquire more of the airline&#x27;s stock. In 1993, Comair was the launch customer for the Canadair Regional Jet, of which it would later operate the largest fleet in the world. By 1999, Comair was the largest regional airline in the country worth over $2 billion, transporting 6 million passengers yearly to 83 destinations on 101 aircraft. Later that year, Delta Air Lines acquired the remaining portion of Comair&#x27;s stock, causing Comair to solely operate Delta Connection flights.

In 1988, two founders of Comair, Patrick Sowers and Robert Tranter launched a new scheduled airline from CVG named Enterprise Airlines, which served 16 cities at its peak. The airline spearheaded the regional jet revolution in a unique manner by operating 10-seat Cessna Citation business jets in scheduled services. The flights became popular with Cincinnati companies. The airline served destinations including Baltimore, Boston, Cedar Rapids, Columbus (OH), Green Bay, Greensboro, Greenville, Hartford, Memphis, Milwaukee, New York–JFK, and Wilmington (NC). The airline also became the first international feed carrier by feeding the British Airways Concorde at JFK. In 1991, the airline ceased operations because of high fuel prices and the suspension of the British Airways contract after the first Gulf War.

===Delta Air Lines hub===

In the mid-1980s, Delta opened a hub in Cincinnati and constructed Terminals C and D with 22 gates. During the decade, Delta ramped up both mainline and Comair operations and established Delta Connection. Delta&#x27;s continued growth at CVG then prompted them to spend $550 million to build their own terminal facility in the 1990s. The new terminal, known then as Terminal 3, opened in 1994 and would largely replace Terminal D. Terminal 3 consisted of three airside concourses, with most of Terminal D&#x27;s gate space being repurposed into Terminal 3&#x27;s Concourse A while Concourses B and C were new construction. Concourses A and B were parallel concourses connected to Terminal 3&#x27;s main building by an underground walkway which also included a people mover (a similar layout to Delta&#x27;s main hub at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport). Concourse C was only accessible by shuttle buses and was a ground-level facility for regional aircraft used by Delta Connection (operated by Comair). After the opening of Terminal 3, the former Terminals B and C were renamed Terminals 1 and 2 respectively, which continued to house non-Delta airlines.

Aircraft operations dramatically increased from around 300,000 to 500,000 yearly aircraft movements. In turn, passenger volumes doubled within a decade from 10 million to over 20 million. This expansion prompted the building of runway 18L/36R and the airport began making preparations to construct Concourse D while adding an expansion to Concourse A and B.

At its peak, CVG became Delta&#x27;s second largest hub, handling over 600 flights daily in 2005. It was the fourth largest hub in the world for a single airline, based on departures, ranking only behind Atlanta, Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, and Dallas/Fort Worth. The hub served everything from a 64-mile flight to Dayton, to a daily nonstop to Honolulu and Anchorage, to transatlantic destinations including Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Manchester, Munich, Paris, Rome, and Zürich. Additionally, Air France operated flights into CVG for several periods for over a decade before finally terminating the service in 2007.

When Delta went into bankruptcy in September 2005, a large reduction at CVG eliminated most early-morning and night flights. These initial cuts caused additional routes to become unprofitable, causing the frequency of low-volume routes to be further cut from 2006 to 2007. Planning for the new east–west runway stopped, along with all expansions to current terminals; Terminal 1 was closed due to lack of service.

In 2008, Delta merged with Northwest Airlines and cut flight capacity from the Cincinnati hub by 22 percent with an additional 17 percent reduction in 2009. Concourse C, which had opened in 1994 at a cost of $50 million, was permanently closed in 2008 and demolished in 2016, since it was built for smaller regional jets which were going out of fashion, and it was not connected to the people mover system. Further reductions in early 2010 caused Delta to close Concourse A in Terminal 3 on May 1, consolidating all operations into Concourse B. This resulted in the layoff of more than 800 employees.

By 2011, Delta was down to roughly 130 flights per day at CVG. After several years of cuts to its older fleet, which were cited as being cut due to high costs associated with rising oil prices, Delta&#x27;s wholly-owned and CVG-based subsidiary, Comair, ceased all operations in September 2012, ending over three decades of operations. In 2017, the hub was downgraded to a focus city, which was eliminated in 2021.

===Recent history===
Until 2015, CVG consistently ranked among the most expensive major airports in the United States. Delta operated over 75% of flights at CVG, a fact often cited as a reason for relatively high domestic ticket prices. Airline officials suggested that Delta was practicing predatory pricing to drive away discount airlines. From 1990 to 2003, ten discount airlines began service at CVG, but later pulled out, including Vanguard Airlines, which pulled out of CVG twice. After Delta downsized its hub operations, low cost carriers began operations and have been sustained at the airport ever since.

Terminal 2 was closed in May 2012, and CVG re-opened and consolidated all non-Delta airlines to Concourse A in Terminal 3 at that time, which became the sole terminal. Renovation and expansion of the ticketing/check-in area and Concourse A took place that year to accommodate the move. Terminals 1 and 2 were torn down in early 2017 to construct an overnight parking and deicing area. Both concourses, the customs facility, baggage claim, and ticketing areas were renovated in late 2017 to mid 2018 under a $4.5 million plan. In 2021, the airport opened a new rental car and ground transportation center adjacent to the main terminal.

==Location==

The airport is in an unincorporated area of Boone County, Kentucky. Various articles of the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; describe the airport as being in Hebron, and the airport terminal uses a Hebron postal address while the administrative headquarters uses an Erlanger postal address. The airport is outside of both the Hebron census-designated place, which is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, and the city of Erlanger.

The airport office at 77 Comair Boulevard was formerly the headquarters of the American regional airline Comair.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
The airport has one terminal and two concourses with a total of 51 gates. Both concourses are islands and are only accessible by an underground moving walkway and people mover. All international arrivals without pre-clearance are handled in Concourse B.

*Concourse A has 23 gates.
*Concourse B has 28 gates.

===Art===
The airport is home to 14 large Art Deco murals created for the train concourse building at Cincinnati Union Terminal during the station&#x27;s construction in 1932. Mosaic murals depicting people at work in local Cincinnati workplaces were incorporated into the interior design of the railroad station by Winold Reiss, a German-born artist with a reputation in interior design. When the train concourse building was designated for demolition in 1972, a &quot;Save the Terminal Committee&quot; raised funds to remove and transport the 14 murals in the concourse to new locations in the Airport. They were placed in Terminal 1, as well as Terminals 2 and 3, which were then being constructed as part of major airport expansion and renovation. When Terminals 1 and 2 were demolished, the murals in those areas were stored and the new Security Screening building was designed to accommodate the heavy weight of the murals with the eastern &quot;store front&quot; windows designed to be removable to permit the future installation of the murals. The murals were also featured in a scene in the film &quot;Rain Man&quot; starring Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. In addition, a walkway to one of the terminals at CVG was featured in the scene in the film when Hoffman&#x27;s character, Raymond, refused to fly on a plane. The nine murals located in the former Terminals 1 &amp; 2 were relocated to the Duke Energy Convention Center in downtown Cincinnati.

Additionally, there are several pieces of Charley Harper artwork in the Concourse B food court.

===Cargo hubs===

In 1984, DHL opened its CVG hub and began operations throughout the world. For a five year period beginning in 2004, DHL to moved its hub to Wilmington Air Park in Wilmington, Ohio. In 2009, DHL reversed course and moved back to CVG to resume its original operations. CVG now serves as the largest of DHL&#x27;s three global hubs (the other two being Leipzig/Halle and Hong Kong) with numerous flights each day to destinations across North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and the Pacific. DHL has completed a $105 million expansion and employs approximately 2,500 at CVG. Because of this growth, CVG stood as the 4th busiest airport in North America based on cargo tonnage and 34th in the world at the time.

On May 28, 2015, DHL announced a $108M expansion to its current facility, which doubled the current cargo operations. The money was used to double the gate capacity for transferring cargo, an expansion to the sorting facility, and various technical improvements, which was completed in Autumn 2016. In addition, this has provided many more jobs for the Cincinnati area, and will dramatically increase the airport&#x27;s operations.

On January 31, 2017, Amazon announced that its new cargo airline, Amazon Air would pick CVG as its main worldwide shipping hub, following an investment of $1.49B in the construction and expansion of a cargo facility on the airport grounds. The company used DHL&#x27;s facilities prior to the construction of its new facility. The hub is Amazon&#x27;s principal shipping hub and was constructed on of land at the airport with a sorting facility and parking positions for over 100 aircraft. On April 30, 2017, Amazon began operations at CVG with 75 Boeing 767-200ER/300ER aircraft based at the airport and planned to have 200 daily takeoffs and landings from its CVG hub to destinations across the U.S. and internationally. The hub could create up to 15,000 jobs in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region. On August 11, 2021, Amazon debuted its new cargo hub at CVG. On May 28, 2024, Atlas announced that &quot;Atlas Air has successfully reached an agreement to fully exit their Amazon CMI operations, which no longer aligned with our company plans. Separately, through Titan, we are pleased to extend the dry leasing portion of our relationship with Amazon.&quot;

<text>George Washington Goethals ( June 29, 1858 – January 21, 1928) was an American military officer and civil engineer, best known for his administration and supervision of the construction and the opening of the Panama Canal. He was the first Governor of Panama Canal Zone from 1914 to 1917, and was also the State Engineer of New Jersey and the Acting Quartermaster General of the United States Army.

==Early life and education==
Goethals was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Flemish immigrants from Stekene, Belgium, Johannes Baptista (John Louis) Goethals, a carpenter, and wife Marie Le Barron. Aged 14, he entered the College of the City of New York. In April 1876, after three years of college, he won an appointment to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York and entered there in June. He graduated second in his class of 52 in June 1880, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army.

==Military career==
Goethals remained at the military academy during the summer and fall of 1880 as an assistant instructor in practical astronomy. In 1881, he attended the Engineer School of Application at Willets Point, New York. His first field assignment came in 1882 with his appointment as engineer officer of the Department of Columbia in Vancouver, Washington. His routine duties included reconnaissance, surveys, and astronomical work, while his most consequential project was the replacement of a 120-foot bridge across the Spokane River.

From 1885 to 1889, he taught civil and military engineering at West Point. He returned to the field in 1889 to assist Colonel John W. Barlow with navigational improvements on the Cumberland River and Tennessee River.

While an instructor at West Point, Goethals agreed to tutor Charles Young, the third African-American graduate of West Point; Young had failed an engineering class but – after being tutored by Goethals – passed and graduated in 1889.

In 1891, Goethals was promoted to captain. He soon was placed in charge of the completion of the Muscle Shoals Canal along the Tennessee River near Florence, Alabama. This was his first independent command, and his responsibilities included the design and construction of the Riverton Lock at Colbert Shoals. His recommendation of a single lock with an unprecedented lift of twenty-six feet was initially opposed by his superiors in Washington, and he was forced to persuade the conservative army engineers of the merits of his design. The lock&#x27;s successful construction set a world record for lock height. The success of the Riverton Lock inspired the eventual adoption of high-lift locks elsewhere, including those for the Panama Canal.

During the Spanish–American War, he was lieutenant colonel and chief of engineers of United States Volunteers. In 1903, Goethals became a member of the first Army General Staff in Washington, D.C., and served as coastal defence expert.

==Construction of the Panama Canal==
Theodore Roosevelt believed that a US-controlled canal across Central America was a vital strategic interest of the country. Roosevelt encouraged the acquisition of the French Panama Canal effort. The purchase of the French-held land for $40 million was authorized by the June 28, 1902, Spooner Act. Since Panama was then part of Colombia, Roosevelt began negotiating with that country to obtain the necessary rights. In early 1903 the Hay–Herrán Treaty was signed by both nations, but the Senate of Colombia failed to ratify the treaty.

Roosevelt implied to Panamanian rebels that if they revolted, the US Navy would assist their fight for independence. Panama declared its independence on November 3, 1903, and the USS &quot;Nashville&quot; impeded Colombian interference. The victorious Panamanians gave the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone on February 23, 1904, for $10 million in accordance with the November 18, 1903 Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty.

===United States takeover===

The United States took control of the French property—after the bankruptcy of the French &quot;Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interocéanique de Panama&quot; that started constructions on The Panama Canal under Ferdinand de Lesseps— on May 4, 1904. The new Panama Canal Zone Control was overseen by the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC) during construction.

The US inherited a small workforce and an assortment of buildings, infrastructure and equipment, much of which had been neglected for fifteen years in the humid jungle environment. There were no facilities in place for a large workforce, and the infrastructure was crumbling.

Although chief engineer John Findley Wallace was pressured to resume construction, red tape from Washington stifled his efforts to obtain heavy equipment and caused friction between Wallace and the ICC. He and chief sanitary officer William C. Gorgas were frustrated by delay, and Wallace resigned in 1905. He was replaced by John Frank Stevens, who arrived on July 26, 1905. Stevens&#x27; approach was to press ahead first and obtain approval later. He improved drilling and dirt-removal equipment at the Culebra Cut for greater efficiency, revising the inadequate provisions in place for soil disposal. In November 1906 Roosevelt visited Panama to inspect the canal&#x27;s progress, the first trip outside the United States by a sitting president.

===Chief engineer of the Panama Canal===

Whether contract employees or government workers would build the canal was controversial. Bids for the canal&#x27;s construction were opened in January 1907, and Knoxville, Tennessee-based contractor William J. Oliver was the low bidder. Stevens disliked Oliver, and vehemently opposed his choice. Although Roosevelt initially favoured the use of a contractor, he eventually decided that army engineers should carry out the work. According to the book &quot;The Panama Canal: An Army&#x27;s Enterprise&quot;, Goethals made such an impression on William Howard Taft, then Secretary of War, that Taft recommended him as an engineer for the Panama Canal. Stevens, frustrated by government inaction and the army involvement, resigned from his position.

In February 1907 US President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Colonel George Washington Goethals chief engineer of the Panama Canal. The building of the Canal was completed in 1914, two years ahead of the target date of June 10, 1916.

Colonel Goethals received unstinted praise from visiting engineers and from the technical press of the world. In 1913 the degree of LL.D. was conferred on him by the University of Pennsylvania, and in the spring of 1914 he was awarded medals by the National Geographic Society, the Civic Forum (New York), and the National Institute of Social Sciences. In 1914, Goethals and William Crawford Gorgas were awarded the inaugural Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences. Also, Congress awarded Goethals their thanks and a promotion to major general. President Wilson appointed Goethals as the first Civil Governor of the Panama Canal Zone.

==World War I==
General Goethals resigned from the post of Governor of the Canal Zone in 1916. Soon he was made chairman of the board of inquiry in regard to the Adamson eight-hour law. His positions thereafter were: State engineer of New Jersey in 1917 and manager of the Emergency Fleet Corporation (briefly). George Washington Goethals was appointed as acting Quartermaster General of the United States Army during the most crucial period of World War I (December 19, 1917 to May 9, 1918) and was a member of the War Industries Board (1918).

===Quartermaster General of the United States Army===
In April 1917 George W. Goethals was serving at President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s request, as General Manager and Director of the Emergency Fleet Corporation— charged with creating improvised ships, to carry the American army and its supplies to France, in the shortest possible time.
The United States as late as 1917 maintained only a small army, smaller than thirteen of the nations and empires already active in the war. After the passage of the Selective Service Act of May 1917, the U.S. drafted 4 million men into military service, the logistics demands were unprecedented. By the summer of 1918, about 2 million US soldiers had arrived in France and approximately 10,000 fresh soldiers were arriving in Europe each day.

Mainly as a result of supply blunders during the bitter winter of 1917, a Congressional investigation was under way, when General Goethals was recalled to active service, and was asked on December 19, 1917, to accept appointment as Acting Quartermaster General. Goethals did so only after Secretary of War Newton D. Baker had assured him full authority and that he would not be interfered with, nine days later he was appointed Director of the Storage &amp; Traffic Service. Reaction to his appointment at home and overseas is illustrated by a message he is said to have received from former President Theodore Roosevelt: &quot;I congratulate you, and thrice over I congratulate the country.&quot;

The Army&#x27;s supply chain suffered from three main problems—a shortage of specialized personnel, decentralized organization and diverse uncoordinated functions. When the United States entered the war, the Quartermaster Corps had suffered a loss of personnel—most officers were sent to the front—this was the first problem demanding attention. Believing the Army&#x27;s business could be best organized along civilian lines, he hired military men who could get along with industrialists and built with and around a number of highly trained executives and businessmen (among the new recruits were Hugh S. Johnson and Robert J. Thorne). Some of these men were commissioned and some were dollar-a-year-men, most of whom never collected the dollar. From General Goethals down, practically everyone was on the job from early morning to late at night, seven days a week.

Goethals reorganized the corps along functional lines and by January 26, purchasing had been taken away from outside agencies, and placed under his control. The functions of each division and branch were specifically set forth and the personnel in charge was officially designated.

The Overman Act, a result of the Congressional investigations started in December 1917, authorized what became known as the &quot;interbureau procurement system,&quot; and was to make the Quartermaster Corps the most important War Department purchasing agency. Goethals established a system of standardization of bureau record keeping and supply chain planning. He also worked on installing uniform procurement policies, with the goal of presenting consolidated estimates to congress.

In April 1918 a further reorganization of the General Staff led to the creation of the Purchase, Storage, &amp; Traffic Division, with General Goethals as Director and Assistant Chief of Staff of the Army. Its creation was the result of protests by General Goethals, to the effect that, though coordination in the handling of Army logistics problems had been a major objective when the General Staff was created in 1903, coordination was practically nonexistent. In the months to come, his division took control of purchasing and storage by the Army as a whole and of transportation over land and water. Now one person coordinated all supply bureaus, which had previously competed for the nation&#x27;s resources, in a system that had inevitably slowed down input of war supplies.

At a meeting of quartermaster personnel in Washington, on August 8, 1918, Secretary of War Baker said:

How fortunate this great army is to have so good and able a provider. Indeed, when the history of this war comes to be written, there will be chapters which have, up to now, almost escaped ... Today, I had a letter from General John J. Pershing in which he was commenting upon the perfection of supplies on the other side...

France and England were not the only overseas destinations for quartermaster supplies. Among others were Italy, Hawaii, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, China, Russia, and Siberia. In a talk General Wood made at this meeting he mentioned that:

... to handle this task, there are now in the Quartermaster Corps over eight thousand officers, one hundred and fifty-five thousand enlisted men, and sixty-five thousand civilian employees, and that number is being increased all the time to keep pace with the wants of our constantly increasing Army.

In 1919, Goethals requested his release from active service.

===Honors and awards===
For his World War I service General Goethals, who retired March 1, 1919—and whom General Peyton C. March, the Army Chief of Staff, called &quot;a great engineer, a great soldier, and the greatest Chief of Supply produced by any nation in the World War &quot;—was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal; was named Commander of the Legion of Honor by France and Honorary Knight Commander, by Great Britain; and was awarded the British Order of St. Michael &amp; St. George and the Grand Cordon of the Order of Wen Hu by China. Previously he had been awarded many medals by scientific and geographic societies and some fifteen honorary degrees by universities and colleges. The citation for his Army DSM reads:

==Civilian life==
Later on, he headed an engineering and construction firm. He became the first consulting engineer of the Port of New York Authority (now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or PANYNJ). Both the original Goethals Bridge and the current Goethals Bridge, which the PANYNJ operates between New York and New Jersey, were named for him. Goethals was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the United States National Academy of Sciences.

==Personal life and death==
In 1884, he married Effie Rodman; they had two sons. Goethals, after having been discovered to have terminal lung cancer in September 1927, died at the age of 69, &quot;surrounded by his wife and two sons&quot;, at his apartment at 12 East 86th Street in Manhattan, New York City on January 21, 1928. He was buried at the cemetery of the United States Military Academy at West Point.

<doc id="264384" wikidata="Q432147" url="?curid=264384" title="Red Herring (magazine)">
<text>Red Herring is a media company that at different times has published a magazine about tech innovation, an online daily technology news service, and technology newsletters, and has hosted events for technology leaders.

Red Herring is perhaps best known for its Red Herring Top 100 technology awards and international conferences it hosts each year. The Red Herring Top 100 began in 1996 and highlights startup companies and private ventures in Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

Red Herring began as a technology business magazine in 1993 and flourished during the dot com boom, with global distribution and bureaus in Bangalore, Beijing, and Paris. It also sponsored conferences designed to bring venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and technologists together. The magazine went into decline with the dot com crash, and ceased print publication in 2003. It was relaunched in late 2004 under publisher Alex Vieux and editor-in-chief Joel Dreyfuss, but again ceased print publication in 2007, continuing publication in digital form until 2011. Red Herring continues to publish technology sector news online.

==History==
&quot;Red Herring&quot; began as a magazine in Belmont, California, founded in 1993 by a former banker named Anthony Perkins. Perkins named the magazine &quot;Red Herring&quot; after what bankers use to describe the prospectus for an initial public offering of stock. The publication initially focused on the venture capital community and expanded its focus to include more of the technology sector.

The founders sold stakes in the magazine to outside investors, but as the dot-com bust deepened, the magazine struggled, ceasing publication in 2003. Later that year, Alex Vieux of Dasar acquired some of the company&#x27;s assets. In September 2003, Vieux relaunched the Herring as a website, with James Daly as editor-in-chief. The first official issue of the relaunched print publication was published in November 2004.

===Corporate history===
Perkins had previously founded &quot;Upside&quot; magazine with Rich Karlgaard (who later became publisher of &quot;Forbes&quot;). Chris Alden and Zack Herlick, friends since junior high school, had started a computer consulting company and taught computer science prior to partnering with Perkins.

Ron Conway, of Angel Investors, was an early adviser and board member. 

====Dot-com era====
Red Herring launched an event and an Internet division on the same day in May 1995 when Venture Market West premiered in Monterey, California, accompanied by the company&#x27;s first website. The Venture Market series (including West, East, South, and Europe) ran successfully until 2001 and was accompanied by other events, such as NDA, Venture, and Herring on Hollywood. 

The Internet operation grew steadily and peaked in 2000 when it acquired Stockmaster.com. 

Ziff Davis invested $2 million in Red Herring in 1997 for approximately 10% of the company, with Eric Hippeau, then CEO of ZD, joining the Red Herring board. Scott Briggs, a former president of Ziff Davis, joined the board in 1997 as well. Broadview Capital Partners invested $25 million into &quot;Red Herring&quot; in 2000, with Steven Brooks and Stephen Bachman joining the board. 

&quot;Red Herring&quot; was joined in the late 1990s by competitors such as IDG&#x27;s &quot;The Industry Standard &quot;and Imagine Media&#x27;s &quot;Business 2.0.&quot; It was also compared to &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, &quot;Fast Company,&quot; and Inside.com. 

Hilary Schneider was hired by the board as CEO in late 2000 and succeeded Alden (who had succeeded Perkins as CEO).

&quot;Red Herring&#x27;s&quot; revenues reached nearly $100 million with a staff around 350, but contracted in 2001 and 2002. BCP invested in several additional rounds to help stabilise the organisation, which went through several rounds of layoffs. Through these financings, BCP obtained control of &quot;Red Herring&quot; and in 2002 put the company through an assignment for the benefit of creditors (ABC), which is a California state process similar to a federal bankruptcy. RHC Media, owned by BCP, bought the &quot;Red Herring&quot; assets out of ABC and kept the business operating. 

After trying unsuccessfully to sell the company, RHC Media decided in early 2003 to cease operations and sell the company&#x27;s assets. The subscription obligation was sold to Time Inc. and the Red Herring brand, URL, and Intellectual Property (such as back issues and online content) were sold to Alex Vieux, Anam Alpenia, Ana Baltodano and Dani Essindi Behrendt of DASAR.

====Purchase====
In April 2003, Vieux, a French technology leader and entrepreneur, purchased the Red Herring brand with plans to revive the magazine. DASAR, a French company led by Vieux, held a 20 percent stake in the undisclosed purchase price. 

Vieux began hiring employees and refocusing the Red Herring brand out of offices in Mountain View, Calif. James Daly, founding editor-in-chief of &quot;Business 2.0&quot;, was hired to head the Red Herring editorial staff. James Dreyfuss, a former editor of PC Week and Information Week, was hired as editor-in-chief. 

Vieux vowed to make the magazine &quot;systematically global&quot;, with a focus on influential technology companies large and small around the world. He refocused Red Herring&#x27;s target audience to C-level tech executives and international readers.
Building a solid editorial team and keeping costs low were also high priorities for Vieux during Red Herring&#x27;s revival. He claimed to have spent 20 percent less per weekly issue than publishers spent previously. 

====Post dot-com relaunch ====
Shortly after the purchase by DASAR, the new owners brought in a team of new editors with experience at competitors of the former print magazine. &quot;Red Herring&quot; re-launched as a website in the fall of 2003.

Red Herring produced several test issues of the print magazine in the fall of 2004 and launched as a full-fledged weekly magazine in January 2005. The print edition came to an end in 2007, but a digital edition continued, available via the company&#x27;s website.

In recent years, Red Herring has been focused on promoting events and awards for new innovative startups, venture capital scene and these events are called Red Herring Global 100, Red Herring North America 100, Red Herring Europe 100 and Red Herring Asia 100.

==Controversy==
Some noted critics say that the Red Herring Top 100 is a scam and companies are forced to pay a large fee to attend award ceremonies in order to receive the award. Red Herring has objected to the criticism.

<text>A hard hat is a type of helmet predominantly used in hazardous environments such as industrial or construction sites to protect the head from injury due to falling objects (such as tools and debris), impact with other objects, and electric shock, as well as from rain. Suspension bands inside the helmet spread the helmet&#x27;s weight and the force of any impact over the top of the head. A suspension also provides space of approximately 30 mm (1.2 inches) between the helmet&#x27;s shell and the wearer&#x27;s head, so that if an object strikes the shell, the impact is less likely to be transmitted directly to the skull. Some helmet shells have a mid-line reinforcement ridge to improve impact resistance. The rock climbing helmet fulfills a very similar role in a different context and has a very similar design.

A bump cap is a lightweight hard hat using a simplified suspension or padding and a chin strap. Bump caps are used where there is a possibility of scraping or bumping one&#x27;s head on equipment or structure projections but are not sufficient to absorb large impacts, such as that from a tool dropped from several stories.

== History ==

In the early years of the shipbuilding industry, workers covered their hats with pitch (tar) and set them in the sun to cure and harden, a common practice for dock workers in constant danger of being hit on the head by objects dropped from ship decks.

Management professor Peter Drucker credited writer Franz Kafka with developing the first civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker&#x27;s Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia (1912), but this information is not supported by any document from his employer.

In the United States, the E.D. Bullard Company was a mining equipment firm in California created by Edward Dickinson Bullard in 1898, a veteran of the industrial safety business for 20 years. The company sold protective hats made of leather. His son, E. W. Bullard, returned home from World War I with a steel helmet that provided him with ideas to improve industrial safety. In 1919 Bullard patented a &quot;Hard-Boiled hat&quot; made of steamed canvas, glue and black paint. That same year, the U.S. Navy commissioned Bullard to create a shipyard protective cap that began the widespread use of hard hats. Not long after, Bullard developed an internal suspension to provide a more effective hat. These early designs bore a resemblance to the steel M1917 &quot;Brodie&quot; military helmet that served as their inspiration.

MSA introduced the new non-conductive thermoplastic, reinforced Bakelite-based &quot;Skullguard&quot; Helmet in 1930. Able to withstand high temperatures and radiant heat loads in the metals industry up to 350 °F (177 °C) without burning the wearer, it was also safe around high-voltage electricity. Bakelite was used to provide protection rigid enough to withstand hard sudden impacts within a high-heat environment but still be light enough for practical use. Made of a Bakelite resin reinforced with wire screen and linen, the Skullgard Helmet is still manufactured in nearly two dozen models in 2021. MSA also produced a low-crown version for coal miners known as Comfo-Cap Headgear, likewise offered with fittings for a headlamp and battery.

On the Hoover Dam project in 1931, hard hat use was mandated by Six Companies, Inc. In 1933, construction began on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco California. Construction workers were required to wear hard hats, by order of Joseph Strauss, project chief engineer. Strauss strove to create a safe workplace; hence, he installed safety nets and required hard hats to be worn while on the job site. Strauss also asked Bullard to create a hard hat to protect workers who performed sandblasting. Bullard produced a design that covered the worker&#x27;s face, provided a window for vision and a supply of fresh air via a hose connected to an air compressor. The MSA Skullgard was the best, but quite expensive. Many hard hats were made of cheaper steel.

Lighter affordable aluminum became popular for hard hats around 1938, except for electrical applications. Fiberglass came into use in the 1940s.
Injection-molded thermoplastics appeared in the 1950s, and began to dominate in the 1960s. Easily shaped with heat, it is cost-effective to manufacture. In 1952, MSA offered the Shockgard Helmet to protect linemen from electrical shock of up to 10,000 volts. In 1961, MSA released the Topgard Helmet, the first polycarbonate hard hat. 1962 brought the V-Gard Helmet, which today is the most widely used hard hat in the United States. Today, most hard hats are made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or advanced engineering resins, such as Ultem.

In 1997, ANSI allowed the development of a ventilated hard hat to keep wearers cooler. Accessories such as face shields, sun visors, earmuffs, and perspiration-absorbing lining cloths could also be used; today, attachments include radios, walkie-talkies, pagers, and cameras.

== Design ==
Because hard hats are intended to protect the wearer&#x27;s head from impacts, hats are made from durable materials, originally from metal, then Bakelite composite, fiberglass, and most-commonly (from the 1950s onward) molded thermoplastic.

Some contemporary cap-style hard hats feature a rolled edge that acts as a rain gutter to channel rainwater to the front, allowing water to drain off the bill, instead of running down the wearer&#x27;s neck. A wide-brimmed cowboy hat-style hard hat is made, although some organizations disallow their use.

Organizations issuing hard hats often include their name, logo, or some other message (as for a ceremonial corner stone laying) on the front.

=== Accessories ===
Hard hats may also be fitted with:
* A visor, as in a welding helmet, or safety visor.
* An extra-wide brim attachment for additional shade.
* Ear protectors.
* Mirrors for increased rear field-of-view.
* A small device that is used to mount a headlamp or flashlight to a hard hat. The mounting device frees hands to continue working rather than having to hold a flashlight.
* A to keep the helmet from falling off if the wearer leans over.
* Thick insulating side pads to keep sides of the head warm. Examples are seen in &quot;Ice Road Truckers&quot;.
*Silicone bands stretched around the brim for color worker ID and Hi Viz night retro-reflectivity.

=== Colors and identification ===
Hard hat colors can signify different roles on construction sites. These color designations vary from company to company and worksite to worksite. Government agencies such as the United States Navy and DOT have their own hard hat color scheme that may apply to subcontractors. On very large projects involving a number of companies, employees of the same company may wear the same color hat.
=== Stickers ===
Stickers, labels and markers are used to mark hard hats so that important information can be shared. As some paints or permanent markers can degrade the plastic in hard hats, adhesive labels or tape are often used instead. Stickers with company logos, and those that indicate a worker&#x27;s training, qualifications, or security level, are also common. Many companies provide ready-made stickers to indicate that a worker has been trained in electrical, confined space, or excavation trench safety, as well as operation of specialized equipment. Environmental monitors often make stickers to indicate that the worker has been educated on the risk of unexploded ordnance or the archaeological/biological sensitivity of a given area. Unions may offer hard hat stickers to their members to promote the union, encourage safety, and commemorate significant milestones.

A hard hat also provides workers with a distinctive profile, readily identifiable even in peripheral vision, for safety around equipment or traffic. Reflective tape can increase visibility both day and night.

== Standards ==

OSHA regulation 1910.135 states that the employer shall ensure that each affected employee wears a protective helmet when working in areas where there is a potential for injury to the head from falling objects. Additionally, the employer shall ensure that a protective helmet designed to reduce electrical shock hazard is worn by each such affected employee when near exposed electrical conductors which could contact the head.

The OSHA regulation does not specifically cover any criteria for the protective helmets, instead OSHA requires that protective helmets comply with ANSI/ISEA Z89.1-2014 – American National Standard for Industrial Head Protection.

Each hard hat is specified by both Type and Class.
Types include:
*ANSI Type I / CSA Type 1 hard hats meet stringent vertical impact and penetration requirements.
*ANSI Type II / CSA Type 2 hard hats meet both vertical and lateral impact and penetration requirements and have a foam inner liner made of expanded polystyrene (EPS).
Classes:
* Class E (Electrical) provides dielectric protection up to 20,000 volts. 
* Class G (General) provides dielectric protection up to 2,200 volts. 
* Class C (Conductive) provides no dielectric protection.
A hard hat is specified by both Type and Class; for example: &quot;Type I Class G.&quot;

ANSI standards for hard hats set combustibility or flammability criteria.
ANSI Z89 standard was significantly revised in 1986, 1997 and 2003. The current American standard for hard hats is ISEA Z89.1-2009, by the International Safety Equipment Association that took over publication of the Z89 standard from ANSI. The ISO standard for industrial protective headgear is ISO 3873, first published in 1977.

In the UK, the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Regulations 1992 specifies that hard hats are a component of PPE and, by law, all those working on construction sites or within hazardous environments are required to wear hard hats.

In Europe all hard hats must have a manufacturer set lifespan, this can be determined from the expiry date or a set period from the manufacture date, which is either stuck to the inside or embossed in the hard hat&#x27;s material.

<doc id="264399" wikidata="Q879126" url="?curid=264399" title="Bitwise operation">
<text>In computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on a bit string, a bit array or a binary numeral (considered as a bit string) at the level of its individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, basic to the higher-level arithmetic operations and directly supported by the processor. Most bitwise operations are presented as two-operand instructions where the result replaces one of the input operands.

On simple low-cost processors, typically, bitwise operations are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition. While modern processors usually perform addition and multiplication just as fast as bitwise operations due to their longer instruction pipelines and other architectural design choices, bitwise operations do commonly use less power because of the reduced use of resources.

==Bitwise operators==
In the explanations below, any indication of a bit&#x27;s position is counted from the right (least significant) side, advancing left. For example, the binary value 0001 (decimal 1) has zeroes at every position but the first (i.e., the rightmost) one.

===NOT===


The bitwise NOT, or bitwise complement, is a unary operation that performs logical negation on each bit, forming the ones&#x27; complement of the given binary value. Bits that are 0 become 1, and those that are 1 become 0. For example:

 NOT 0111 (decimal 7)
 = 1000 (decimal 8)

 NOT 10101011 (decimal 171)
 = 01010100 (decimal 84)

The result is equal to the two&#x27;s complement of the value minus one. If two&#x27;s complement arithmetic is used, then codice_1.

For unsigned integers, the bitwise complement of a number is the &quot;mirror reflection&quot; of the number across the half-way point of the unsigned integer&#x27;s range. For example, for 8-bit unsigned integers, codice_2, which can be visualized on a graph as a downward line that effectively &quot;flips&quot; an increasing range from 0 to 255, to a decreasing range from 255 to 0. A simple but illustrative example use is to invert a grayscale image where each pixel is stored as an unsigned integer.

===AND===

A bitwise AND is a binary operation that takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits. Thus, if both bits in the compared position are 1, the bit in the resulting binary representation is 1 (1 × 1 = 1); otherwise, the result is 0 (1 × 0 = 0 and 0 × 0 = 0). For example:

 0101 (decimal 5)
 AND 0011 (decimal 3)
 = 0001 (decimal 1)

The operation may be used to determine whether a particular bit is &quot;set&quot; (1) or &quot;cleared&quot; (0). For example, given a bit pattern 0011 (decimal 3), to determine whether the second bit is set we use a bitwise AND with a bit pattern containing 1 only in the second bit:

 0011 (decimal 3)
 AND 0010 (decimal 2)
 = 0010 (decimal 2)

Because the result 0010 is non-zero, we know the second bit in the original pattern was set. This is often called &quot;bit masking&quot;. (By analogy, the use of masking tape covers, or &quot;masks&quot;, portions that should not be altered or portions that are not of interest. In this case, the 0 values mask the bits that are not of interest.)

The bitwise AND may be used to clear selected bits (or flags) of a register in which each bit represents an individual Boolean state. This technique is an efficient way to store a number of Boolean values using as little memory as possible.

For example, 0110 (decimal 6) can be considered a set of four flags numbered from right to left, where the first and fourth flags are clear (0), and the second and third flags are set (1). The third flag may be cleared by using a bitwise AND with the pattern that has a zero only in the third bit:

 0110 (decimal 6)
 AND 1011 (decimal 11)
 = 0010 (decimal 2)

Because of this property, it becomes easy to check the parity of a binary number by checking the value of the lowest valued bit. Using the example above:

 0110 (decimal 6)
 AND 0001 (decimal 1)
 = 0000 (decimal 0)

Because 6 AND 1 is zero, 6 is divisible by two and therefore even.

===OR===

A bitwise OR is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 0 if both bits are 0, while otherwise the result is 1. For example:

 0101 (decimal 5)
 OR 0011 (decimal 3)
 = 0111 (decimal 7)

The bitwise OR may be used to set to 1 the selected bits of the register described above. For example, the fourth bit of 0010 (decimal 2) may be set by performing a bitwise OR with the pattern with only the fourth bit set:

 0010 (decimal 2)
 OR 1000 (decimal 8)
 = 1010 (decimal 10)

===XOR===

A bitwise XOR is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only one of the bits is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. In this we perform the comparison of two bits, being 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. For example:

 0101 (decimal 5)
 XOR 0011 (decimal 3)
 = 0110 (decimal 6)

The bitwise XOR may be used to invert selected bits in a register (also called toggle or flip). Any bit may be toggled by XORing it with 1. For example, given the bit pattern 0010 (decimal 2) the second and fourth bits may be toggled by a bitwise XOR with a bit pattern containing 1 in the second and fourth positions:

 0010 (decimal 2)
 XOR 1010 (decimal 10)
 = 1000 (decimal 8)

This technique may be used to manipulate bit patterns representing sets of Boolean states.

Assembly language programmers and optimizing compilers sometimes use XOR as a short-cut to setting the value of a register to zero. Performing XOR on a value against itself always yields zero, and on many architectures this operation requires fewer clock cycles and less memory than loading a zero value and saving it to the register.

If the set of bit strings of fixed length &quot;n&quot; (i.e. machine words) is thought of as an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space formula_1 over the field formula_2, then vector addition corresponds to the bitwise XOR.

===Mathematical equivalents===

Assuming , for the non-negative integers, the bitwise operations can be written as follows:

:formula_3

=== Truth table for all binary logical operators ===
There are 16 possible truth functions of two binary variables; this defines a truth table.

Here is the bitwise equivalent operations of two bits P and Q:

==Bit shifts==
The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations, the digits are moved, or &quot;shifted&quot;, to the left or right. Registers in a computer processor have a fixed width, so some bits will be &quot;shifted out&quot; of the register at one end, while the same number of bits are &quot;shifted in&quot; from the other end; the differences between bit shift operators lie in how they determine the values of the shifted-in bits.

===Bit addressing===
If the width of the register (frequently 32 or even 64) is larger than the number of bits (usually 8) of the smallest addressable unit, frequently called byte, the shift operations induce an addressing scheme from the bytes to the bits.
Thereby the orientations &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are taken from the standard writing of numbers in a place-value notation, such that a left shift increases and a right shift decreases the value of the number ― if the left digits are read first, this makes up a big-endian orientation.
Disregarding the boundary effects at both ends of the register, arithmetic and logical shift operations behave the same, and a shift by 8 bit positions transports the bit pattern by 1 byte position in the following way:

===Arithmetic shift===

In an &quot;arithmetic shift&quot;, the bits that are shifted out of either end are discarded. In a left arithmetic shift, zeros are shifted in on the right; in a right arithmetic shift, the sign bit (the MSB in two&#x27;s complement) is shifted in on the left, thus preserving the sign of the operand.

This example uses an 8-bit register, interpreted as two&#x27;s complement:

 00010111 (decimal +23) LEFT-SHIFT
 = 00101110 (decimal +46)

 10010111 (decimal −105) RIGHT-SHIFT
 = 11001011 (decimal −53)

In the first case, the leftmost digit was shifted past the end of the register, and a new 0 was shifted into the rightmost position. In the second case, the rightmost 1 was shifted out (perhaps into the carry flag), and a new 1 was copied into the leftmost position, preserving the sign of the number. Multiple shifts are sometimes shortened to a single shift by some number of digits. For example:

 00010111 (decimal +23) LEFT-SHIFT-BY-TWO
 = 01011100 (decimal +92)

A left arithmetic shift by &quot;n&quot; is equivalent to multiplying by 2&quot;n&quot; (provided the value does not overflow), while a right arithmetic shift by &quot;n&quot; of a two&#x27;s complement value is equivalent to taking the floor of division by 2&quot;n&quot;. If the binary number is treated as ones&#x27; complement, then the same right-shift operation results in division by 2&quot;n&quot; and rounding toward zero.

===Logical shift===

In a &quot;logical shift&quot;, zeros are shifted in to replace the discarded bits. Therefore, the logical and arithmetic left-shifts are exactly the same.

However, as the logical right-shift inserts value 0 bits into the most significant bit, instead of copying the sign bit, it is ideal for unsigned binary numbers, while the arithmetic right-shift is ideal for signed two&#x27;s complement binary numbers.
===Circular shift===
Another form of shift is the &quot;circular shift&quot;, &quot;bitwise rotation&quot; or &quot;bit rotation&quot;.

====Rotate====
In this operation, sometimes called &quot;rotate no carry&quot;, the bits are &quot;rotated&quot; as if the left and right ends of the register were joined. The value that is shifted into the right during a left-shift is whatever value was shifted out on the left, and vice versa for a right-shift operation. This is useful if it is necessary to retain all the existing bits, and is frequently used in digital cryptography.
====Rotate through carry====
&quot;Rotate through carry&quot; is a variant of the rotate operation, where the bit that is shifted in (on either end) is the old value of the carry flag, and the bit that is shifted out (on the other end) becomes the new value of the carry flag.

A single &quot;rotate through carry&quot; can simulate a logical or arithmetic shift of one position by setting up the carry flag beforehand. For example, if the carry flag contains 0, then codice_3 is a logical right-shift, and if the carry flag contains a copy of the sign bit, then codice_3 is an arithmetic right-shift. For this reason, some microcontrollers such as low end PICs just have &quot;rotate&quot; and &quot;rotate through carry&quot;, and don&#x27;t bother with arithmetic or logical shift instructions.

Rotate through carry is especially useful when performing shifts on numbers larger than the processor&#x27;s native word size, because if a large number is stored in two registers, the bit that is shifted off one end of the first register must come in at the other end of the second. With rotate-through-carry, that bit is &quot;saved&quot; in the carry flag during the first shift, ready to shift in during the second shift without any extra preparation.
=== In high-level languages ===
==== In C family of languages ====

In C and C++ languages, the logical shift operators are &quot;codice_5&quot; for left shift and &quot;codice_6&quot; for right shift. The number of places to shift is given as the second argument to the operator. For example,

x = y « 2;

assigns codice_7 the result of shifting codice_8 to the left by two bits, which is equivalent to a multiplication by four.

Shifts can result in implementation-defined behavior or undefined behavior, so care must be taken when using them. The result of shifting by a bit count greater than or equal to the word&#x27;s size is undefined behavior in C and C++. Right-shifting a negative value is implementation-defined and not recommended by good coding practice; the result of left-shifting a signed value is undefined if the result cannot be represented in the result type.

In C#, the right-shift is an arithmetic shift when the first operand is an int or long. If the first operand is of type uint or ulong, the right-shift is a logical shift.

=====Circular shifts=====

The C-family of languages lack a rotate operator (although C++20 provides codice_9 and codice_10), but one can be synthesized from the shift operators. Care must be taken to ensure the statement is well formed to avoid undefined behavior and timing attacks in software with security requirements. For example, a naive implementation that left-rotates a 32-bit unsigned value codice_7 by codice_12 positions is simply

uint32_t x = ..., n = ...;
uint32_t y = (x « n) | (x » (32 - n));
However, a shift by codice_13 bits results in undefined behavior in the right-hand expression codice_14 because codice_15 is codice_16, and codice_16 is outside the range 0–31 inclusive. A second try might result in

uint32_t x = ..., n = ...;
uint32_t y = n ? (x « n) | (x » (32 - n)) : x;

where the shift amount is tested to ensure that it does not introduce undefined behavior. However, the branch adds an additional code path and presents an opportunity for timing analysis and attack, which is often not acceptable in high-integrity software. In addition, the code compiles to multiple machine instructions, which is often less efficient than the processor&#x27;s native instruction.

To avoid the undefined behavior and branches under GCC and Clang, the following is recommended. The pattern is recognized by many compilers, and the compiler will emit a single rotate instruction:

uint32_t x = ..., n = ...;
uint32_t y = (x « n) | (x » (-n &amp; 31));
There are also compiler-specific intrinsics implementing circular shifts, like _rotl8, _rotl16, _rotr8, _rotr16 in Microsoft Visual C++. Clang provides some rotate intrinsics for Microsoft compatibility that suffers the problems above. GCC does not offer rotate intrinsics. Intel also provides x86 intrinsics.

==== Java ====

In Java, all integer types are signed, so the &quot;codice_5&quot; and &quot;codice_6&quot; operators perform arithmetic shifts. Java adds the operator &quot;codice_20&quot; to perform logical right shifts, but since the logical and arithmetic left-shift operations are identical for signed integer, there is no &quot;codice_21&quot; operator in Java.

More details of Java shift operators:
* The operators codice_5 (left shift), codice_6 (signed right shift), and codice_20 (unsigned right shift) are called the &quot;shift operators&quot;.
* The type of the shift expression is the promoted type of the left-hand operand. For example, codice_25 is equivalent to .
* If the promoted type of the left-hand operand is int, only the five lowest-order bits of the right-hand operand are used as the shift distance. It is as if the right-hand operand were subjected to a bitwise logical AND operator &amp; with the mask value 0x1f (0b11111). The shift distance actually used is therefore always in the range 0 to 31, inclusive.
* If the promoted type of the left-hand operand is long, then only the six lowest-order bits of the right-hand operand are used as the shift distance. It is as if the right-hand operand were subjected to a bitwise logical AND operator &amp; with the mask value 0x3f (0b111111). The shift distance actually used is therefore always in the range 0 to 63, inclusive.
* The value of is &quot;n&quot; right-shifted &quot;s&quot; bit positions with zero-extension.
* In bit and shift operations, the type codice_26 is implicitly converted to codice_27. If the byte value is negative, the highest bit is one, then ones are used to fill up the extra bytes in the int. So will result in .

==== JavaScript ====

JavaScript uses bitwise operations to evaluate each of two or more units place to 1 or 0.

==== Pascal ====

In Pascal, as well as in all its dialects (such as Object Pascal and Standard Pascal), the logical left and right shift operators are &quot;codice_28&quot; and &quot;codice_29&quot;, respectively. Even for signed integers, codice_29 behaves like a logical shift, and does not copy the sign bit. The number of places to shift is given as the second argument. For example, the following assigns &quot;x&quot; the result of shifting &quot;y&quot; to the left by two bits:

 x := y shl 2;

== Other ==
* popcount, used in cryptography
* count leading zeros

==Applications==
Bitwise operations are necessary particularly in lower-level programming such as device drivers, low-level graphics, communications protocol packet assembly, and decoding.

Although machines often have efficient built-in instructions for performing arithmetic and logical operations, all these operations can be performed by combining the bitwise operators and zero-testing in various ways. For example, here is a pseudocode implementation of ancient Egyptian multiplication showing how to multiply two arbitrary integers codice_31 and codice_32 (codice_31 greater than codice_32) using only bitshifts and addition:
c ← 0
while b ≠ 0
 if (b and 1) ≠ 0
 c ← c + a
 left shift a by 1
 right shift b by 1
return c
Another example is a pseudocode implementation of addition, showing how to calculate a sum of two integers codice_31 and codice_32 using bitwise operators and zero-testing:
while a ≠ 0
 c ← b and a
 b ← b xor a
 left shift c by 1
 a ← c
return b
== Boolean algebra ==

Sometimes it is useful to simplify complex expressions made up of bitwise operations, for example when writing compilers. The goal of a compiler is to translate a high-level programming language into the most efficient machine code possible. Boolean algebra is used to simplify complex bitwise expressions.

=== AND ===

* codice_37
* codice_38
* codice_39
* codice_40

* codice_41

=== OR ===

* codice_45
* codice_46

=== NOT ===

* codice_47

=== XOR ===

* codice_48
* codice_49
* codice_50
* codice_51
* codice_52
* codice_53

Additionally, XOR can be composed using the 3 basic operations (AND, OR, NOT)

* codice_56
* codice_57
* codice_58
* codice_59
* codice_60

=== Inverses and solving equations ===
It can be hard to solve for variables in Boolean algebra, because unlike regular algebra, several operations do not have inverses. Operations without inverses lose some of the original data bits when they are performed, and it is not possible to recover this missing information.

<text>Joseph Gelfer (born 1974) is a British author and academic who analyses spirituality, religion and masculinity. His book &quot;2012: Decoding the Countercultural Apocalypse&quot; (which brought together scholarly analyses of the end of the world phenomenon from anthropology, Mayan studies, religious studies and cultural studies) attracted considerable media attention. He founded and edits &quot;Journal of Men, Masculinities and Spirituality&quot;, created the Future Masculinity online course and styles himself Director of Masculinity Research.

== Early life and education ==
Gelfer was born in 1974 in Southampton, England.

He has a BA Hons from University of Bristol and a doctorate in religious studies from Victoria University of Wellington (2008). His thesis was titled &quot;Numen, Old Men: contemporary masculine spiritualities and the problem of patriarchy&quot;.

== Academic research and professional positions ==
Joseph Gelfer is a lecturer and tutor at Université Catholique de l&#x27;Ouest. He has had concurrent careers in research in religion and masculinities and in academic editing and coaching. He has held positions as Adjunct Research Associate at the School of Political and Social Inquiry at Monash University, Honorary Research Associate at University of Divinity, Melbourne, as editorial specialist at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and an assistant editor at the University of London.

== &quot;2012: Decoding the Countercultural Apocalypse&quot; ==
Leading up to and during 2012 Gelfer received media attention for his book, &quot;2012: Decoding the Countercultural Apocalypse&quot;, which brought together scholarly analyses of the end of the world phenomenon from anthropology, Mayan studies, religious studies and cultural studies. It examines the &quot;merits and demerits of cultural appropriation&quot; and &quot;the lack of consensus between different scholars and the inconsistent goals of different disciplines&quot;. He aimed &quot;to strike some balance between visionary and critical thinking&quot; and he was criticised by members from the skeptical, catastrophist, conspiracy and spiritually inclined communities for his non-partisan views. His proposition from the book&#x27;s analysis was that no physical event would occur but &quot;that people [would] realise the changes they dearly wish to see in the world will not come from some cosmic source, but rather instead political agency and social activism. And that, ironically, may result in 2012 being a catalyst for a shift in human consciousness, exactly as the prophets predicted.&quot;

== Other writing ==
Gelfer has been active in social commentary. publishing articles about topics such as psychedelic substances within a spiritual context, the commercialisation of spiritualities, child discipline, open access publishing and teetotalism. He has also published a number of travel articles and a book of Latrinalia called &quot;The Little Book of Toilet Graffiti&quot; (which according to Gelfer was simply a fund raising exercise and was followed by &quot;The Little Book of Student Bollocks&quot; and &quot;The Little Book of Office Bollocks).&quot;

== Five Stages of Masculinity ==
The Five Stages of Masculinity is a model used to view a person&#x27;s understandings of masculinity. This model is the basis of the Masculinity Research organisation directed by Joseph Gelfer which offers &quot;insight into men and masculinity in three key areas: Market research for products and services, Social research for non-profit and governmental policymakers [and] People and culture development for businesses and organizations&quot;.

== InformitTV interviews ==
In 2012 Gelfer undertook a number of interviews on a variety of topics published through InformitTV. 
* Lynette Russell and Joseph Gelfer discuss the challenges faced by Indigenous Australians. Professor Lynette Russell is Director of Monash Indigenous Centre, Monash University. Professor Russell specialises in anthropological and Indigenous history.

<text>Brobdingnag is a fictional land that is occupied by giants, in Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1726 satirical novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels.&quot; The story&#x27;s main character, Lemuel Gulliver, visits the land after the ship on which he is travelling is blown off course. As a result, he becomes separated from a party exploring the unknown land. In the second preface to the book, in 1727, Gulliver laments that the publisher misspelled the land&#x27;s name, which Gulliver asserts is actually called Brobdingrag.

The adjective &quot;Brobdingnagian&quot; has come to describe anything of colossal size.

==Location==
Brobdingnag is placed by Swift into the real world, he describes its location and geography in Part II of &quot;Gullivers Travels&quot; and provides a map showing where it is. However, the accounts are somewhat contradictory.

The map printed at the beginning of Part II indicates that Brobdingnag is located on the northwest coast of North America, in probably what is now British Columbia. The map shows (from south to north) Point Monterey, Port Sir Francis Drake, Cape Mendocino, Cape St. Sebastian, Cape Blanco and the semi-mythical Strait of Anián, all locations on the Pacific coast of North America, and depicts Brobdingnag as a peninsula extending west into the Pacific to the north of the Straits.

In the book, Gulliver describes his voyage from England. After wintering at the Cape of Good Hope, the ship reached a latitude of five degrees south, northward of Madagascar in March 1703, and the Moluccas, &quot;about three degrees northwards of the line&quot; in April. From there, a storm drives the ship &quot;about five hundred leagues to the east&quot; (this would place the ship still in Micronesia), after which the crew determine to &quot;hold on the same course rather than turn more northerly, which might have brought us to the north-west parts of Great Tartary&quot;. They sighted land, which Gulliver later discovers is Brobdingnag, on 16 June 1703.

Brobdingnag is claimed to be a continent-sized peninsula long and miles wide, which based on the location given by Gulliver would suggest that it covers most of the North Pacific. Contrariwise, his map shows Brobdingnag to be of a similar size and extent as the present-day Washington, and his description of the voyage puts it at a six-week voyage from the Moluccas.

Swift was highly sceptical about the reliability of travel writings, and the unlikely geographic descriptions parody many unreliable travel books published at the time which Percy Adams describes as &quot;travel lies&quot;.

==Scale==

Gulliver states that a nine-year-old girl named Glumdalclitch, who teaches him the language, stands &quot;not above 40 feet tall, being small for her age&quot;. In at least two cases, he states explicitly that a Brobdingnagian&#x27;s eyes are &quot;above sixty feet&quot; from the ground, giving a ratio of at least eleven to one. He also states that he would &quot;appear as inconsiderable to this nation as a Lilliputian would be among us&quot;, indicating the same twelve to one ratio given for Lilliput was intended. This is further reinforced by hailstone being almost 1,800 times as heavy as in Europe (with 1/12 ratio, it should be 1,728). The queen&#x27;s court dwarf, the shortest native on record, is not quite thirty feet tall, which, on a 1/12 scale, would make him equivalent to a person a bit below thirty inches, the height of the Chinese dwarf He Pingping. Gulliver also describes visiting the chief temple in Lorbrulgrud, whose tower was the highest in the kingdom, but reports he &quot;came back disappointed, for the height is not above three thousand foot&quot;, which &quot;allowing for the difference in size between those people and us in Europe&quot; is &quot;not equal in proportion to Salisbury steeple&quot;. Outside world whales are stated to be of a size that one man can barely carry, and are eaten by common folk if they find a beached specimen.

==Geography==
Brobdingnag is said to be located between Japan and California, extending six thousand miles in length, and between three and five thousand miles in breadth. It is described as a peninsula, terminated to the northeast by a range of volcanoes up to high separating the country from unknown land beyond. It is surrounded on three other sides by the ocean, and the people have never been able to develop ocean-going ships. The land &quot;has 51 cities, near 100 walled towns, and a great number of villages&quot;.

Lorbrulgrud is claimed to be the capital with the king having a seaside palace at Flanflasnic. The capital &quot;contains above 80,000 houses&quot; and &quot;is in length three &quot;glonglungs&quot; (about fifty four English miles) and two and a half in breadth&quot;.
Gulliver tells us that Lorbrulgrud was &quot;situated near the middle of that empire&quot; and was three thousand miles distant from the farmer&#x27;s house on the coast, that the journey took ten weeks and that they &quot;crossed five or six rivers many degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges&quot;, and &quot;there was hardly a rivulet smaller than the Thames at London Bridge&quot;.

== People, flora and fauna ==

The people of Brobdingnag are described as giants who are as tall as 60 feet high and whose stride is ten yards.

All of the other animals and plants, and even natural features such as rivers and even hail, are in proportion. The rats are the size of mastiffs, with tails &quot;two yards long, wanting an inch&quot;, while mastiffs are &quot;equal in bulk to four elephants&quot;. Gulliver describes flies &quot;as big as a Dunstable lark&quot;, and wasps the size of partridges, with stings &quot;an inch and a half long, and sharp as needles&quot;. This also means that the country is far more dangerous for people of normal human size, as evidenced by Gulliver using his hanger far more often here—namely, on attacking vermin—than in any other of the strange countries he visited, but the people are civilised. A &quot;splacknuck&quot; is an animal about long, to which Gulliver is compared in size, although it is never explained which animal it corresponds to.

Fossil records are claimed to show that the ancestors of the Brobdingnagians were once even larger, likely as an allusion to the medieval tendency of supporting similar claims with bones that had, around Swift&#x27;s time, started being identified as belonging to elephants, mastodons and even whales. The King of Brobdingnag argues that the race has deteriorated.

The language of Brobdingnag is depicted as being of a character distinctively different from that of Lilliput.

== History and government ==
Gulliver relates that, in the past, there were battles between the monarchy, nobility, and people resulting in a number of civil wars ending in a treaty. The monarchy is based on reason. City officials are elected by ballot. The King of Brobdingnag finds English institutions and behaviour wanting in comparison with &quot;his&quot; country&#x27;s. Based on Gulliver&#x27;s descriptions of their behaviour, the King describes the English as &quot;the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth&quot;. Swift intended the moral relationship between the English and Brobdingnagians to be as disproportionate as the physical relationship. The King of Brobdingnag is considered to be based on Sir William Steele, a statesman and writer, whom Swift worked for early in his career. Some critics believed it to be based on Sir William Temple.

The army of Brobdingnag is claimed to be large with 207,000 troops including 32,000 cavalry although the society has no known enemies. The local nobility commands the forces; firearms and gunpowder are unknown to them. The King scolds Gulliver when he tries to interest the statesman in the use of gunpowder.

The laws of Brobdingnag are simple and easy to follow. There is little civil litigation. Murderers are beheaded.

In Gulliver&#x27;s in-character preface to the story, headed &quot;A letter from Captain Gulliver to his cousin Sympson&quot;, he specifies that the correct spelling is in fact &quot;... &quot;Brobdingrag&quot; (for so the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously &quot;Brobdingnag&quot;), ... [emphasis added]&quot;. This correction by the fictional author is a device used to add an element of verisimilitude to the story.

== Culture ==
Brobdingnagian culture consists of history, poetry, mathematics and ethics, mathematics being a particular strength. Printing has been long known but libraries are relatively small. The king has the largest library, which contains about one thousand volumes. The Brobdingnagians favour a clear literary style.

== Symbolism ==
The mismatch between body sizes of Brobdingnag giants and Gulliver is the main feature of the plot: as Dr Johnson stated with some derision in 1775, &quot;once you have thought of big and little men, it is very easy to do all the rest&quot;. However, Swift investigates deeper: the mismatch between the world of Brobdingnag and Gulliver&#x27;s size creates an environment akin to the one experienced by real-life babies, &quot;Every child begins life in Brobdingnag&quot; (cf. John Locke&#x27;s children that &quot;are Travellers newly arrived in a strange Country, of which they know nothing&quot;). Brobdingnagians are nice to Gulliver, trying to teach him, providing with toys, while he yearns for comfort and approval, proudly demonstrating his achievements. The enlarged world diminishes adulthood. Child analogy is reinforced by a contrast between a bad parent (the farmer) and a good one (the King). The scene of being found in Brobdingnag: emergence from the safe confines of the ship into the world of giants - screaming - being picked up and looked upon - reception by the family - is an allusion to birth.

In each of the Gulliver journeys, Swift dismisses a particular aspect of high opinion that humanity holds about itself. The travel to Brobdingnag exposes the lack of maturity: Gulliver has to be saved by Brobdingnagians not just from the danger of the oversized world around him, but from his own follies: quarreling with a &quot;dwarf&quot;, suggesting the King to use gunpowder on his subjects, seeing his own smallness, but overlooking narrowmindedness.

Brobdingnag can be interpreted as an outsider&#x27;s view of England (the farther he goes away, the closer he comes to the own country, seen from a different perspective), while Gulliver&#x27;s travel is similar to a life story of an English gentlemen of the time. 

While traveling to and staying at Brobdingnag, he is always confined (aboard a ship, on a boat in a water tank, in a box); to go anywhere, he needs an adult to carry him. The box might symbolize the restriction of freedom, a prison, or a coffin. In the end, the box becomes a vehicle for freedom (symbolized by sea, possibly, the final freedom granted by death).

==Legacy==

The land is the subject of James Gillray&#x27;s satirical hand-coloured etching and aquatint print, titled &quot;The King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver.–Vide. Swift&#x27;s Gulliver: Voyage to Brobdingnag&quot;. Produced in 1803, it shows a profile of George III of the United Kingdom, representing the Brobdingnagian king, holding a miniature Napoleon, representing Gulliver, while observing him through a spyglass. It was published on 26 June, five weeks after the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens, which precipitated the Napoleonic Wars. The king&#x27;s speech balloon in the top half of the print reads &quot;My little friend Grildrig, you have made a most admirable panegyric upon Yourself and Country, but from what I can gather from your own relation &amp; the answers I have with much pains wringed &amp; extorted from you, I cannot but conclude you to be one of the most pernicious, little-odious-reptiles, that nature ever suffer&#x27;d to crawl upon the surface of the Earth&quot;.

On Mars&#x27;s largest moon, Phobos, the crater Grildrig is named because of Swift&#x27;s &#x27;prediction&#x27; of the two then undiscovered Martian moons, which his Laputan astronomers had discovered.

<doc id="264421" wikidata="Q6760633" url="?curid=264421" title="Margo Kingston">
<text>Margo Kingston (born 1959) is an Australian journalist, author, and commentator. She is best known for her work at &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and her weblog, Webdiary. Since 2012, Kingston has been a citizen journalist, reporting and commenting on Australian politics via Twitter and her own Web site.

==Early life and education==
Kingston was born in Maryborough, Queensland and was raised in Mackay. She attended the University of Queensland, graduating with a degree in arts and law.

Her sister Gay Alcorn is a journalist and newspaper editor.

==Career==
Kingston qualified as a solicitor and practised in Brisbane and later lectured in commercial law in Rockhampton, before becoming a journalist for &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;. Within a year she moved to &quot;The Times on Sunday&quot;. She also worked for &quot;The Age&quot;, &quot;The Canberra Times&quot; and &quot;A Current Affair&quot; before moving to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, where she worked until August 2005.

Kingston gained prominence in 1998 when she led a sit-in of journalists at the federal election campaign launch of the One Nation Party in the Queensland town of Gatton. The group was protesting the party&#x27;s treatment of the media during the campaign. Her experiences during this time are recorded in her book, &quot;Off The Rails: The Pauline Hanson Trip&quot;, which won the 2000 Dobbie award for best first book by a female writer. 

In 2004, Margo wrote &quot;Not Happy, John&quot;, launched in Sydney by Tony Fitzgerald QC.

Kingston may be seen as part of the &quot;larrikin/ratbag&quot; Australian journalistic tradition which also encompasses Alan Ramsey and Stephen Mayne. This tradition is characterised by a willingness to break with convention, espouse controversial opinions and intervene in the events which the journalist is reporting. Kingston has been perceived by many, including her supporters, as openly left wing in her political views, however she describes her own position this way: &quot;the irony [is] that I&#x27;m not left wing, I&#x27;m a small-l liberal. A dying breed.&quot;

==Webdiary==
Margo Kingston also wrote Webdiary, which until 22 August 2005 was on the Sydney Morning Herald website. On this site Kingston recorded opinions on current events alongside contributors from the general public. Kingston terminated her contract with John Fairfax Holdings, publishers of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in August 2005. A new site was set up bearing the motto, &quot;Independent, Ethical, Accountable and Transparent&quot;.

Webdiary content is collected to form part of the Pandora Archive, Australia&#x27;s Web Archive established initially by the National Library of Australia and now built in collaboration with nine other Australian libraries and cultural collecting organisations. The Pandora Archive collects and provides long-term access to selected online publications and web sites that are about Australia, are by an Australian author on a subject of social, political, cultural, religious, scientific or economic significance and relevance to Australia, or are by an Australian author of recognised authority and make a contribution to international knowledge.

Webdiary&#x27;s Charter states, in part, that its mission is &quot;to help meet the unmet demand of some Australians for conversations on our present and our future, and to spark original thought and genuine engagement with important issues which effect us all, to link thinking Australians whoever they are and wherever they live and to insist that thinking Australians outside the political and economic establishment have the capacity to contribute to the national debate&quot;.

Margo Kingston set an ethical standard for Webdiary based on the Code of Ethics of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, and also an Editorial Policy. The Editorial Policy states &quot;inter alia&quot;: &quot;If you think you&#x27;ve been unfairly edited, or that we&#x27;ve wrongly refused to publish your comments, please feel free to query our decision by posting a comment. This sometimes happens, and leads to an online discussion of the meaning and interpretation of the guidelines.&quot;

Margo Kingston announced on 7 December 2005 that she would be leaving the site (and journalism) due to financial constraints. The site continued in existence without her input and is managed by Webdiary Pty Ltd, a private company established by volunteers who had helped Margo Kingston to establish and maintain the independent new site. Directors of Webdiary Pty Ltd and a group of volunteers kept the site alive after Margo Kingston had walked away from it. Margo Kingston related her view of the Webdiary story in a lecture to the South Australian Governor&#x27;s Leadership Forum in February 2006. In June 2007, one of the four directors of Webdiary Pty Ltd resigned and the one volunteer still actively involved in comment moderation also quit for a time. Margo Kingston returned to Webdiary at that point in order to keep it alive.

Many opinions featured in Webdiary made their way into Margo Kingston&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Not Happy, John&quot;, which inspired the &#x27;Not happy, John!&#x27; campaign, of which she was a founding member. Kingston was also a regular guest on &quot;Late Night Live&quot;, a nightly radio programme on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Radio National network.

On 3 August 2007, the publishing director of Penguin Australia, Bob Sessions, asked Margo Kingston to update &quot;Not Happy, John&quot;. The update, titled &quot;Still Not Happy, John!&quot; was published by Penguin on 1 October 2007, and it was launched at an event held at Manning Clark House on 8 October 2007.

==No Fibs==

After community supported Webdiary closed in July 2012, Margo Kingston came out of retirement to co-publish No Fibs, a crowd funded Citizen journalism news source focusing on Australian politics, with former Webdiary colleague, Tony Yegles. Kingston credited Twitter with her re-emergence as a journalist, and No Fibs began to distribute its articles via its own website and Twitter. In early 2013 an ebook of &quot;Still Not Happy, John!&quot; was published by Penguin.

In May 2013 No Fibs launched a citizen journalism project in partnership with Macquarie University to report the 2013 Australian federal election. A national call for voluntary citizen journalists was distributed on Twitter resulting in reports from all states and territories except the Northern Territory.

No Fibs published reports by a cluster of citizen journalists resident in the Victorian Division of Indi where, after a lengthy preference count, Independent candidate Cathy McGowan was elected over long-term Liberal incumbent, Sophie Mirabella. During the election campaign, Kingston created a Twitter hashtag, #IndiVotes, to distribute No Fibs&#x27; reports and focus widespread social and mainstream media interest on the election outcome in Indi.

<doc id="264424" wikidata="Q2642989" url="?curid=264424" title="British Central Africa Protectorate">
<text>The British Central Africa Protectorate (BCA) was a British protectorate proclaimed in 1889 and ratified in 1891 that occupied the same area as present-day Malawi: it was renamed Nyasaland in 1907. British interest in the area arose from visits made by David Livingstone from 1858 onward during his exploration of the Zambezi area. This encouraged missionary activity that started in the 1860s, undertaken by the Universities&#x27; Mission to Central Africa, the Church of Scotland and the Free Church of Scotland, and which was followed by a small number of settlers. The Portuguese government attempted to claim much of the area in which the missionaries and settlers operated, but this was disputed by the British government. To forestall a Portuguese expedition claiming effective occupation, a protectorate was proclaimed, first over the south of this area, then over the whole of it in 1889. After negotiations with the Portuguese and German governments on its boundaries, the protectorate was formally ratified by the British government in May 1891.

==Origin==
The Shire Highlands south of Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi) and the lands west of the lake were explored by David Livingstone between the 1858 and 1864 as part of his Zambezi expeditions. Livingstone suggested that what he claimed was the area&#x27;s benign climate and fertility would make it ideal for the promotion of Christianity and commerce. As a result of Livingstone&#x27;s writings, several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1878 The African Lakes Company Limited, predecessor to the African Lakes Corporation Limited, was established in Glasgow by a group of local businessmen with links to the Presbyterian missions. Their aim was to set up a trade and transport concern that would work in close cooperation with the missions to combat the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade, to make a commercial profit, and to develop European influence in the area. A mission and small trading settlement was established at Blantyre in 1876 and a British consul took up residence there in 1883.

Concessionaires holding prazo estates from the Portuguese crown were active in the lower valley of the Shire River from the 1830s and the Portuguese government claimed suzerainty over much of Central Africa, without maintaining effective occupation over more than a small part of it. In 1879, the Portuguese government formally claimed the area south and east of the Ruo River (which currently forms the southeastern border of Malawi), and in 1882 occupied the lower Shire River valley as far north as the Ruo River. The Portuguese then attempted to negotiate British acceptance of their territorial claims, but the convening of the Berlin Conference (1884) ended these bilateral discussions. Meanwhile, the African Lakes Company was attempting to obtain the status of a Chartered company from the British government, but it had not managed to do so by 1886. In 1885-86 Alexandre de Serpa Pinto undertook a Portuguese expedition which reached the Shire Highlands, but it failed make any treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs in territories west of Lake Malawi.

As late as 1888, the British Foreign Office declined to accept responsibility for protecting the rudimentary British settlements in the Shire Highlands, despite unsubstantiated claims by the African Lakes Company of Portuguese interference with their trading activities. However, it also declined to negotiate with the Portuguese government on their claim that the Shire Highlands should be considered part of Portuguese East Africa, as it was not regarded by the Foreign Office as under effective Portuguese occupation. In order to prevent Portuguese occupation, the British government sent Henry Hamilton Johnston as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior, with instructions to report on the extent of Portuguese rule in the Zambezi and Shire valleys and the vicinity, and to make conditional treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction. These conditional treaties of friendship did not amount to the establishment of a British protectorate but prevented those rulers from accepting protection from another state. On his way to take up his appointment, Johnston spent six weeks in Lisbon in early 1889 attempting to negotiate an acceptable agreement on Portuguese and British spheres of influence in Central Africa. The draft agreement reached in March 1889 would have created a British sphere including all the area west of Lake Nyasa and also Mashonaland but not including the Shire Highlands and Lower Shire valley, which were to be part of the Portuguese sphere. This went beyond what the Foreign Office was prepared to accept, and the proposal was later rejected.

In 1888, the Portuguese government instructed its representatives in Portuguese East Africa to attempt to make treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs southeast of Lake Malawi and in the Shire Highlands, and an expedition organised under Antonio Cardoso, a former governor of Quelimane, set off in November 1888 for the lake. Rather later, in early 1889, a second expedition led by Alexandre de Serpa Pinto moved up the Shire valley. Between them, these two expeditions made over twenty treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi. Serpa Pinto met Johnston in August 1889 east of the Ruo River, when Johnston advised him not to cross the river into the Shire Highlands. Previously, Serpa Pinto had acted with caution, but in September, following minor clashes between Serpa Pinto&#x27;s advancing force and Kololo who had been left behind by Livingstone at the end of his Zambezi expedition in 1864 and had formed minor chieftainships, he crossed the Ruo to Chiromo, now in Malawi. In response to this incursion, Johnston&#x27;s deputy John Buchanan declared a Shire Highlands Protectorate in Johnston&#x27;s absence, despite the contrary Foreign Office instructions. It seems probable that Buchanan&#x27;s action, made without reference to the Foreign Office, but following instructions that Johnston had left before he departed for the north, was to prevent any further advance by Serpa Pinto rather than to establish British rule in the area. However, in October 1889 Serpa Pinto&#x27;s soldiers attacked one of the Kololo chiefs, killing around 70 of his followers and, with two armed river boats, pushed up the Shire River through the area over which Buchanan had established a protectorate. After Serpa Pinto&#x27;s departure owing to serious illness in November 1889, his second-in-command, João Coutinho, pushed on as far as Katunga, the nearest river port to Blantyre, and some Kololo chiefs fled to Blantyre for safety.

Johnston&#x27;s proclamation of a further protectorate, the Nyasaland Districts Protectorate, west of Lake Malawi was also contrary to Foreign Office instructions. However, it was endorsed by the Foreign Office in May 1891. This was because the discovery of the Chinde channel in the Zambezi delta, which was deep enough to allow sea-going ships to enter the Zambezi, which was an international waterway, without having to enter Portuguese territory, whereas previously such ships had to use the port of Quelimane. Salisbury was also influenced by the offer by the British South Africa Company to fund the administration of the protectorate, which convinced him to bow to popular pressure. There followed an Anglo-Portuguese Crisis in which a British refusal of arbitration was followed by the 1890 British Ultimatum of 11 January 1890. This demanded that the Portuguese give up all claims to territories beyond the Ruo River and west of Lake Malawi. The Portuguese government accepted under duress and ordered their troops in the Shire valley to withdraw to the south bank of the Ruo. This order was received by the commander at Katunga on 8 March 1890 and all Portuguese forces had evacuated Katunga and Chiromo by 12 March. 

An 1891 Anglo-Portuguese treaty fixed the southern borders of what had been renamed the British Central Africa Protectorate. Although the Ruo River had been the provisional boundary between Portuguese and British spheres of influence since 1879, as part of the 1891 treaty and under strong British pressure, an area west of the Shire and south of its confluence with the Ruo which had been controlled by an Afro-Portuguese family, was allocated to Britain and now forms the Nsanje District. The treaty also granted Britain a 99-year lease over Chinde, a port at one of the Zambezi delta mouths where sea-going ships could transfer goods and passengers to river boats. The northern border of the protectorate was agreed at the Songwe River as part of the Anglo-German Convention in 1890. Its western border with Northern Rhodesia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River by agreement with the British South Africa Company, which governed what is today Zambia under Royal Charter until 1924.

==Consolidation==
In 1891, Johnston only controlled a fraction of the Shire Highlands, itself a small part of the whole protectorate, and initially had a force of only 70 Indian troops to impose British rule. These troops, later reinforced by Indian and African recruits, were used up to 1895 to fight several small wars against those unwilling to give up their independence. After this, until 1898, troops were used to assist the locally recruited police force to suppress the slave trade. The three main groups resisting British occupation were Yao chiefs in the south of the protectorate and Swahili groups around the centre and north of Lake Nyasa, both involved in the slave trade, and Ngoni people who had formed two aggressively expansionists kingdoms in the west and north.

The Yao chiefdoms were closest to the European settlements in the Shire Highlands and, as early as August 1891, Johnston used his small force against three minor chiefs before attacking the most important Yao chief, who was based on the eastern shore of Lake Nyasa. After initial success, Johnston&#x27;s forces were ambushed and forced to retreat and, during 1892, undertook no further action against the several Yao chief that rejected British control. However, in 1893, Cecil Rhodes made a special grant to allow Johnston to recruit a further 200 Indian troops and also African mercenaries to take action to counter armed resistance and, by the end of 1895, the only Yao resistance was from small armed bands without fixed bases that were able to cross into Mozambique when challenged. 
Next, Johnston prepared to attack Mlozi bin Kazbadema, the leader of the so-called &quot;north end Arabs&quot;, although most of those that contemporary Europeans in East Africa described as Arabs were either Muslim Swahili from the east coast of Africa or Nyamwezi people, who imitated Arab dress and customs but were rarely Muslims. Mlozi had defeated two attempts which the African Lakes Company Limited in the Karonga War had made between 1887 and 1889, with some unofficial British government support, to dislodge him and his followers and end the slave trade. Johnston had signed a truce with him in October 1889 and left him in peace until late 1895, despite Mlozi often breaking the terms of that truce. Johnston first secured the neutrality of the Swahili ruler of Nkhotakota by paying him a subsidy and, in November 1895, he embarked a force of over 400 Sikh and African riflemen with artillery and machine guns on steamers at Fort Johnston and set out for Karonga. Without any prior warning, Johnston assaulted two of Mlozi&#x27;s smaller stockades on 2 December and, on the same day, surrounded Mlozi&#x27;s large, double-fenced fortified town, bombarding it for two days and finally assaulting it on 4 December, facing stiff resistance. Mlozi was captured, given a cursory trial and hanged on 5 December: between 200 and 300 of his fighters were killed, many while attempting to surrender, as well as several hundred non-combatants, who were killed in the bombardment. The other Swahili stockades did not resist and were destroyed after their surrender.

The Maseko Ngoni kingdom in the west of the protectorate had been the most powerful state in the region in the 1880s but was weakened by internal disputes and a civil war. Initially, Gomani, the victor in the civil war that ended in 1891, was on good terms with British officials and missionaries, but he became concerned at the number of his young men going to work on European-owned estates in the Shire Highlands and by Johnston&#x27;s forceful reaction to Yao resistance. In November 1895, he forbade his subjects either to pay taxes to, or work for, the British, and he was also accused of harassing nearby missions which had told their members not to obey Gomani&#x27;s instructions. Johnston&#x27;s deputy Alfred Sharpe attacked and defeated Gomani&#x27;s forces on 23 October 1896. Gomani was sentenced to death by a court martial and shot on 27 October. Within a year, 5,000 of his former subjects were working in the Blantyre area.

As the northern Ngoni kingdom did not threaten European trading interests, as it was far from European-owned estates, and as the Scottish mission at Livingstonia was influential within the kingdom, Johnston did not use force against it. It accepted British rule in 1904 on condition of retaining its own traditions. Its king was recognised as a paramount chief, the only one in the protectorate at that time, and received a government salary, whereas Gomani&#x27;s son only received comparable recognition in the 1930s.

The offer by the British South Africa Company to fund the administration of the newly-formed protectorate was part of an attempt by Cecil Rhodes to take over the administration of all the territory claimed by Britain north of the Zambezi. This was resisted, particularly by the Scottish missionaries and, in February 1891, Salisbury agreed to a compromise under which what later became Northern Rhodesia would be under company administration and what later became Nyasaland would be administered by the Foreign Office. However Henry Hamilton Johnston would be both the Administrator of the British South Africa Company&#x27;s territory and Commissioner and Consul-General of the protectorate, and would receive a payment of £10,000 a year from Rhodes towards the expenses of administering both territories. This arrangement lapsed in 1900, when North-Eastern Rhodesia was formed as a separate protectorate with its own Administrator

Harry Johnston, who became Sir Henry at the end of his term, was Commissioner and Consul-General from 1 February 1891 to 16 April 1896. Alfred Sharpe, Sir Alfred from 1903, who had been Johnston&#x27;s deputy from 1891, took over as Commissioner and Consul-General in 1896, serving until 1 April 1910 (first as Commissioner and Consul-General and then as Governor of the Nyasaland Protectorate from 1907), with Francis Barrow Pearce as acting Commissioner from 1 April 1907 to 30 September 1907 and William Henry Manning as acting Commissioner from 1 October 1907 to 1 May 1908. Although the first Consul appointed in 1883 had used Blantyre as his base, the second moved to Zomba because it was closer to the slave route running from Lake Malawi to the coast. Johnston also preferred Zomba because of its relative isolation, healthiness and superb scenery, and it became the governor&#x27;s residence and administrative capital throughout the colonial period although Blantyre remained the commercial centre.

In 1896, Johnston set up a small government Secretariat in Zomba which, with the addition of a few technical advisers appointed soon after, formed the nucleus of his central administration. In 1892, Johnston received powers to set up courts and divide the protectorate into districts and, until 1904 when the Colonial Office assumed this responsibility, he selected district officials with the title of Collectors of Revenue, Their official title later became Residents, and they were the predecessors of District Commissioners. Their main duties were to collect taxes, to ensure a supply of labour to European-owned estates and government projects and ensure government instructions and regulations were carried out. Johnston&#x27;s Collectors included ex-soldiers, ex-missionaries and ex-employees of the African Lakes Company: the main consideration was that they had African experience. A few Collectors in strategically important locations had contingents of troops attached to their district, but most had no more than one or two assistants. By 1905 there were 12 Collectors and 26 Assistant Collectors
The power of existing chiefs were minimised in favour of direct rule by the Residents, as Johnston did not consider the chiefs should play any part in the administration of the protectorate. The exception was the Northern Ngoni Kingdom, which retained a significant degree of autonomy. In practice, however, the relatively few district officers required the cooperation of local chiefs it administer their districts and allowed chiefs to continue in their traditional roles.

One of the major legal problems facing Johnston was that of land claims. For up to 25 years before the protectorate was formed, a number of European traders, missionaries and others had claimed to have acquired often large areas of land through contracts signed with local chiefs, usually for derisory payment. Although Johnston had a duty to look into the validity of these land deals, and although he accepted that the land belonged to its tribes and that their chiefs had no right to alienate it, he put forward the legal fiction that each chief&#x27;s people had tacitly accepted he could assume such a right. As a result, Johnston accepted the validity of those claims where the signatory was the chief of the tribe occupying the land, provided that the terms of the contract were not inconsistent with British sovereignty. Where claims were accepted, Johnston issued Certificates of Claim (in effect the grant of freehold, or fee simple, title). Out of 61 claims made, only two were rejected outright and a handful reduced in size. These Certificate of Claim were issued at a time when no professional judges had been appointed to the protectorate, and the work of Johnston and his assistants was subsequently criticised by judges and later administrators.

In total, 59 Certificates of Claim to land rights were registered, mostly between 1892 and 1894, covering an area of , or 15% of the total land area of the Protectorate. This included in the North Nyasa District that the British South Africa Company had acquired for its mineral potential and which was never turned into plantation estates. Except for this large grant in the Northern Region, much of the remaining land, some of estates, included much of the best arable land in the Shire Highlands, which was the most densely populated part of the country.

In the first years of the protectorate, very little of the alienated land was planted. Settlers wanted labour and encouraged existing Africans to stay on the undeveloped land, and new workers (often migrants from Mozambique) to move onto it, and grow their own crops. From the late 1890s, when the estates started to produce coffee, the owners began to charge these tenants a rent, usually satisfied by two months’ labour a year, of which one month was to meet the worker&#x27;s tax obligation; however, some owners demanded longer periods of labour.

In order to raise revenue, and also to increase the supply of labour, a Hut tax was imposed from 1895 in the Shire Highlands. This was gradually extended to the rest of the protectorate, becoming universal in 1906. It was nominally three shillings a year, but could be satisfied by one month&#x27;s labour a year spent on a settler estate or working for the government.

The name of the protectorate was changed to the Nyasaland Protectorate on 6 July 1907.

==Population==
There was only one, rather limited, official census in this period, in 1901, which returned a population of 736,724. However, the African population was estimated on the basis of hut tax records with a multiplier for the average inhabitants per hut. As no taxes were collected in some areas in the north of the protectorate in 1901, their inhabitants were estimated on the basis of occasional official visits. It is believed that much of the country was reasonably well populated in the mid-19th century, but by the 1880s large areas had become underpopulated through devastating raids by the Ngoni people and the famines which they caused or as the result of slave raiding. There may well have been large areas in the Shire Highlands that had been virtually depopulated.

Some of the shortfall in population may have been made good by the inward migration of families groups of so-called &quot;Anguru&quot;, Lomwe speaking migrants from the parts of Mozambique east of the Shire Highlands estates, who became estate tenants. They began to arrive from 1899, and the 1921 census counted 108,204 &quot;Anguru&quot;. Neither the 1901 nor the 1911 censuses recorded tribal affiliation, but the very substantial population increases in districts adjacent to Mozambique, especially Blantyre and Zomba districts, whose recorded populations more than doubled in this decade, suggest substantial immigration. In this period, relatively few Africans left the protectorate as migrant workers, but outward labour migration became more common later.

British occupation did not significantly change African society within the protectorate until the First World War, with most people continuing to live under the social and political systems that existed before 1891. No attempt was made to remove or limit the powers of the Yao, Ngoni or Makololo chiefs (who had first entered the area in the 19th century) over the original inhabitants they had displaced, subjugated or assimilated, although the Swahili slave traders had been killed in the warfare of the 1890s or had left. One area in which early efforts to change the system manifestly failed was that of domestic slavery. Although slave-trading had been eliminated, and Johnston issued instructions that domestic slaves were to be emancipated, this particular form of slavery endured, particularly in the Central Region, well into the first quarter of the 20th century

==Economy and transport==
Throughout the period of the protectorate, most of its people were subsistence farmers growing maize, millet and other food crops for their own consumption. As the protectorate had no economic mineral resources, its colonial economy had to be based on agriculture, but before 1907 this had hardly started to develop. In pre-colonial times trade was limited to the export of ivory and forest products such as natural rubber in exchange for cloth and metals and, for the first few years of the protectorate, ivory and rubber collected from indigenous vines were the principal elements of a tiny export trade. The first estate crop was coffee, grown commercially in quantity from around 1895, but competition from Brazil, which had flooded the world markets with coffee by 1905, and droughts led to its decline in favour of tobacco and cotton. Both these crops had previously been grown in small quantities, but the decline of coffee prompted planters to turn to tobacco in the Shire Highlands and cotton in the Shire Valley. Tea was also first planted commercially in 1905 in the Shire Highlands, but significant development of tobacco and tea growing only took place after the opening of the Shire Highlands Railway in 1908.

Before the railway opened, water was the most efficient means of transport. From the time of Livingstone&#x27;s 1859 expedition, small steamers navigated the Zambezi-Lower Shire river system, and they were later introduced on the Upper Shire and Lake Malawi. The Upper and Lower Shire were separated by about of the Middle Shire, where rapids and shallows made navigation impractical, and both the Upper and Lower Shire were often too shallow for larger vessels, particularly in the dry season. In addition, the main areas of economic activity in the early protectorate were in the Shire Highlands, mainly near Blantyre, which was from Chikwawa, a small Shire River port. Transport of goods to river ports was by inefficient and costly head porterage, as the Shire valley was unsuitable for draught animals.

Shallow draught steamers carrying 100 tons or less had to negotiate Lower Shire marshes and low-water hazards in the Zambezi and its delta to reach the small, poorly equipped coastal port of Chinde in Mozambique. Low water levels in Lake Nyasa reduced the Shire River&#x27;s flow from 1896 to 1934, so the main river port was moved, first to Chiromo, further from the main settlements below a steep escarpment and from 1908 to Port Herald (now Nsanje).

As early as 1895, Johnston suggested a line from the protectorate&#x27;s main commercial town, Blantyre, to Quelimane in Mozambique. However, most of its proposed route was in Portuguese territory and Quelimane was only suitable for small ships. Also in 1895, Eugene Sharrer proposed building a railway from Blantyre to Chiromo, and he formed the Shire Highlands Railway Company Limited in December 1895 to achieve this. Although Johnston urged the Foreign Office to finance this railway, it declined to do so, but in 1901 it agreed in principle to the company building the proposed railway, and granted the company of land adjacent to the railway route. Because of delays over raising the funds needed for construction, and disputes over its route, it was not until early 1903 that construction began. The line was opened from Blantyre to Chiromo in 1907.

Modern communications began to be established in 1891, with the opening of the territory&#x27;s first post office at Chiromo. This remained the main sorting office until after the railway was opened, when Limbe became the postal hub. A telegraph connection from Blantyre to Cape Town via Umtali was established in April 1898.

<doc id="264430" wikidata="Q519273" url="?curid=264430" title="David Sylvian">
<text>David Sylvian (born David Alan Batt; 23 February 1958) is an English musician, singer and songwriter who came to prominence in the late 1970s as frontman and principal songwriter of the band Japan. The band&#x27;s androgynous look and increasingly electronic sound made them an important influence on the UK&#x27;s early-1980s new wave scene.

Following their break-up, Sylvian embarked on a solo career with his debut album &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; (1984). His solo work has been described by AllMusic as &quot;far-ranging and esoteric&quot;, and has included collaborations with artists such as Ryuichi Sakamoto, Robert Fripp, Holger Czukay, Jon Hassell, Bill Nelson and Fennesz.

While Sylvian&#x27;s recordings of the 1980s and 1990s were a mixture of art rock, pop, jazz fusion, and avant-garde experimentalism mixed with ambient, his more recent compositions have drawn increasingly on musical minimalism and free improvisation.

==Biography==
===Early years===
David Sylvian was born David Alan Batt in Beckenham, Kent, England. He grew up in nearby Lewisham, South London, in a working-class home. His father Bernard was a plasterer by trade, his mother Sheila a housewife. He had an older sister and a younger brother, Steve. Sylvian later said he never enjoyed his childhood, mainly because of the environment of mid-1960s Lewisham. In 1966, he and Steve applied to appear in an advertisement for Mattel&#x27;s Major Matt Mason action figures. As an escape and emotional release from his discomfort he found an interest in music via his sister, who brought Motown and soul records to the home. He attended Catford Boys School where he became a friend of Anthony Michaelides, later known as Mick Karn. When David received an acoustic guitar and his brother a drum kit as Christmas presents from their father, the three boys began to play music together.

===1970s–early 1980s: Japan===

The band Japan, whose other members included Mick Karn on bass, guitarist Rob Dean, keyboardist Richard Barbieri and Sylvian&#x27;s brother Steve as drummer (under the name Steve Jansen), began as a group of friends. As youngsters they played music as a means of escape, playing Sylvian&#x27;s two-chord numbers – sometimes with Karn as the frontman, sometimes with Sylvian at the fore.

They christened themselves Japan in 1974, signed a recording contract with Hansa Records, and became an alternative glam rock outfit in the mould of David Bowie, T. Rex, and the New York Dolls. A fan of the New York Dolls, Sylvian adopted his stage name from Sylvain Sylvain, while his brother took Jansen from David Johansen. Over a period of a few years, their music became more sophisticated, drawing initially on the art rock stylings of Roxy Music. Their visual image also evolved and, although they had worn make-up since their creation in the mid-1970s, the band was tagged with the New Romantic label in the early 1980s. The band themselves disputed any connection with the New Romantic movement, and Sylvian stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t like to be associated with them. The attitudes are so very different.&quot; Of Japan&#x27;s fashion sense, Sylvian said: &quot;For them [New Romantics], fancy dress is a costume. But ours is a way of life. We look and dress this way every day.&quot; In an October 1981 interview, at the pinnacle of the New Romantic movement in mainstream pop music, Sylvian commented: &quot;There&#x27;s a period going past at the moment that may make us look as though we&#x27;re in fashion.&quot;

Japan released five studio albums between March 1978 and November 1981. In 1980, the band signed with Virgin Records, where Sylvian remained as a recording artist for the next twenty years. The band suffered from personal and creative clashes, particularly between Sylvian and Karn, with tensions springing from Sylvian&#x27;s relationship with Yuka Fujii, a photographer, artist, and designer, and Karn&#x27;s former girlfriend. Fujii quickly became an influential figure in Sylvian&#x27;s life. She was the first person to introduce Sylvian seriously to jazz, which in turn inspired him to follow musical avenues not otherwise open to him. She also encouraged Sylvian to incorporate spiritual discipline into his daily routine. Throughout his solo career, Fujii maintained a large role in the design of artwork for his albums. Japan played their final concerts in December 1982 before dissolving, their ultimate show taking place in Nagoya on December, 16.

===1980s–1990s: Solo career===
In 1982, Sylvian released his first solo record, a double A-side single and the result of a collaborative effort with Ryuichi Sakamoto, entitled &quot;Bamboo Houses/Bamboo Music&quot;. Sakamoto&#x27;s first contribution to Sylvian&#x27;s work, though, had been as co-writer of &quot;Taking Islands in Africa&quot; on the Japan album &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot; (1980). Sylvian also worked with Sakamoto on the UK Top 20 song &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; for the 1983 Nagisa Oshima film &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot;.

Sylvian&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot;, released in June 1984, was a critical and commercial success. The album included contributions from Sakamoto, Kenny Wheeler, Jon Hassell, Holger Czukay, Ronny Drayton, Danny Thompson, and from Sylvian&#x27;s former bandmates Steve Jansen and Richard Barbieri. The lead single became the UK Top 20 single &quot;Red Guitar&quot;, with a promo video directed by Anton Corbijn.

Between 19 June and 30 June 1984, Hamiltons Gallery in London held an exhibition, &quot;Perspectives&quot;, of Polaroid photographs by Sylvian. The major exhibition of his work coincided with the release of his book &quot;Perspectives – Polaroids 82-84&quot;, documenting these pictures. There were also exhibitions in Tokyo and Turin.

In 1985, Sylvian released an instrumental EP &quot;Words with the Shaman&quot;, in collaboration with Jansen, Hassell, and Czukay. The recording was re-released the same year on a compilation album, &quot;&quot;, with the addition of &quot;Steel Cathedrals&quot;, a piece recorded with Sakamoto, Czukay, Jansen, Wheeler, Robert Fripp and Masami Tsuchiya. &quot;Steel Cathedrals&quot; was the soundtrack to a 20-minute video. The short film was shot in two days during November 1984 in and around the outskirts of Tokyo, Japan. A large part of the music was completed during that same month and recorded over a period of three days. Sylvian later updated the material in London in an attempt to elaborate on the theme started earlier in Japan, and to further improve the quality of the soundtrack. He would identify &quot;Steel Cathedrals&quot; as his first experience with improvisations.

Sylvian&#x27;s demo &quot;Sylvian&#x27;s Machine&quot; became Propaganda&#x27;s single &quot;&quot;, released in 1985. Singer Claudia Brücken stated that Sylvian helped them with his writing and musical skills on &quot;p:Machinery&quot;, pretty much influencing the final structure and atmosphere of the piece.

His next release was the two-record set &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;, which featured one record of atmospheric vocal tracks and a second record consisting of ambient instrumentals. The album contained significant contributions from noted guitarists Bill Nelson (formerly of Be-Bop Deluxe) and Robert Fripp (of King Crimson), and a rhythm section comprising Steve Jansen on drums and Ian Maidman of Penguin Cafe Orchestra on bass. Released on 13 September 1986, the album reached Number 24 on the UK Album chart.

Composition of new material in early 1987 was followed by recording sessions at Chateau Miraval in the south of France, and by May 1987 &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot; was completed, finally being released in October 1987.

&quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot; made greater use of acoustic instruments and was musically oriented towards sombre, emotive ballads laced with string arrangements by Ryuichi Sakamoto and Brian Gascoigne. It reached number 37 in the UK charts and remained for two weeks.

The album was followed by his first live outing as a solo artist, in an 80-day world tour called &quot;In Praise of Shamans&quot;, from March to June 1988. Alongside Sylvian were Jansen, Barbieri, guitars and keyboards from Robbie Aceto, brass and sax from Mark Isham, bass from Ian Maidman and lead guitar from David Torn. There were no songs from Sylvian&#x27;s former band Japan in the setlist.

&quot;Beehive was the summation of all the solo material that went before it&quot;, Sylvian said. &quot;I knew when I had finished I wouldn&#x27;t be returning to quite the same waters again. The period following on from...&quot;Beehive&quot; was the hardest of my life. A descent into hell.&quot;

Following &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot;, it would be 1999 before he released his next solo offering, as he descended into a prolonged period of clinical depression. The crisis began to gather momentum prior to undertaking a 1988 tour. That took its toll and Sylvian found himself in a frighteningly unstable state, which he would experience in varying degrees of intensity over the next 3 or 4 years. Sylvian was unable to work in isolation, but at the same time felt the need to throw himself into collaborative project after collaborative project in a hope of recognising via his response something of what he was dealing with. At these times, manifestations of the crisis were less apparent.

Ultimately he left behind his Christian roots and via explorations of widely varied philosophies ranging from the writings of Gurdjieff to Gnosticism to Zen Buddhism, all of which left its traces in his lyrics and music, he settled on Buddhism as his primary spiritual path.

Never one to conform to commercial expectations, Sylvian then collaborated with Holger Czukay. Sylvian was at Can&#x27;s studio in Cologne in 1986 to do a vocal for Czukay&#x27;s record. But instead they started improvise, and recorded the first piece in three nights. &quot;Plight and Premonition&quot; was finally released in March 1988 while Sylvian was still on tour. &quot;Flux and Mutability&quot; was released the following year, and it also included contributions from Can members Jaki Liebezeit and Michael Karoli. &quot;Flux and Mutability&quot; was less spontaneous in its conception than &quot;Plight and Premonition&quot;. For &quot;Flux&quot;, Sylvian travelled to Cologne for a two-week creative Christmas break at the end of 1988, so this was planned unlike the unexpected genesis of &quot;Plight&quot;.

Virgin decided to close out the 1980s with the release of &quot;Weatherbox&quot;, an elaborate boxed-set compilation designed by Russell Mills, consisting of Sylvian&#x27;s four previous solo albums. Concurrent with &quot;Weatherbox&quot;, Sylvian released the non-album single &quot;Pop Song&quot;.

In 1990, Sylvian collaborated with artists Russell Mills and Ian Walton on the elaborate multi-media installation using sculpture, sound, and light titled &quot;Ember Glance – The Permanence of Memory&quot;. The exhibition was staged in September and October 1990 at the temporary museum &#x27;Space FGO-Soko&#x27; on Tokyo Bay, Shinagawa, Tokyo.

===1991–1994: Rain Tree Crow and Robert Fripp===
The members of Japan came together once more, as Rain Tree Crow, after a nine-year hiatus. The majority of the material was written as a result of group improvisations, with no rehearsals. This approach to writing was an integral element to the whole project, and in many ways it was the reason for the collaboration. The Rain Tree Crow project had initially been conceived as a long term album deal, with Sylvian&#x27;s insistence that the name Japan would not be used in conjunction with its promotion. But the recording went over budget and Virgin refused to put in any more money unless the name Japan could be used. The resulting deadlock was resolved by Sylvian&#x27;s decision to personally finance the mixing of the album. However, the group was no longer interested in re-forming, and the album was released as a one-off.

Sylvian first thought of collaborating with guitarist Robert Fripp in 1986, but, characteristically, it took them a while to manage it. They only began to improvise and write as a duo at the end of 1991. That same year, Fripp had approached Sylvian to front a possible new version of the band King Crimson, but Sylvian declined.

Fripp had encouraged Sylvian to return to the live-stage, a place he admitted he did not find comfortable (&#x27;Sylvian didn&#x27;t like being the centre of attention&#x27;). The pair&#x27;s concerts were, like Sylvian&#x27;s work in the studio, largely improvised. On the few dates they undertook in Japan and Italy in 1992, they had no idea when they walked out into the lights what might happen, even what time they would finish their night&#x27;s work. One evening Sylvian found himself confronted with his past. He felt moved to play an acoustic version of &quot;Ghosts&quot;, Japan&#x27;s biggest hit. It was the first time he&#x27;d touched it since 1983. &#x27;It was quite nice because it somehow satisfied the expectation of the audience that I should play something from my songbook&#x27;. Sylvian stated. It was the trio work that they did first, only in Europe, Trey Gunn, Robert Fripp and Sylvian, that was the eyeopener. They had some material which was kind of knocked up one week before they went on the road, and so it was very unstable, and just sitting there on stage and just trying to keep a hold of it was fascinating. There were periods in the evening when Sylvian was doing nothing, and he was just absorbed in what Robert Fripp was doing. And Sylvian began to realize that it was a comfortable place to be. He enjoyed the environment. Up until that point it was all about reproducing the songs and presenting them in such-and-such way. But that was different, and it began to interest him, and it opened up his eyes to the pleasures of performing.

Fripp and Sylvian then recorded the album &quot;The First Day&quot; between December 1992 and March 1993 at studios in New York and New Orleans, and released the album in July 1993. Something of a departure for Sylvian, the album melded his own philosophical lyrics to funk workouts and aggressive rock stylings very much in the mould of Fripp&#x27;s King Crimson.

To capitalise on the album&#x27;s success, they went back out on the road on their &quot;The Road to Graceland Tour&quot; which began in Tokyo on 14 October 1993. The additional musicians on stage with Sylvian, Fripp and Gunn were Michael Brook and Pat Mastelotto. A live recording, titled &quot;&quot;, released in 1994, was culled from the final shows of the tour.

Sylvian and Fripp&#x27;s final collaboration was the installation &quot;Redemption – Approaching Silence&quot;. The exhibition was held at the P3 Art and Environment centre in Shinjuku, Tokyo, and ran from 30 August to 18 September 1994. The accompanying music was composed by Sylvian, with text written and recited by Fripp.

===1995-1999: Slow Fire Tour and &quot;Dead Bees on a Cake&quot;===
At the end of August 1995, Sylvian undertook a one-man solo tour which he called &#x27;Slow Fire – A Personal Retrospective&#x27;, with dates in Italy, Germany, Japan, Belgium, The Netherlands, England, Canada and North America. The last show on the tour was played in New York City at The Town Hall 11 November 1995. The show featured songs drawn from throughout Sylvian&#x27;s career, singing and playing piano and guitar.

In 1999, Sylvian released &quot;Dead Bees on a Cake&quot;, his first solo album proper since &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot; 12 years earlier. Once the album was mixed at Dave Kents Napa Studio, the project was finished, from the beginning to end a process that extended from 1993 to the late summer of 1998, &quot;Dead Bees on a Cake&quot; eventually being released in March 1999.

The album gathered together the most eclectic influences of all his recordings, ranging from soul music to jazz fusion to blues to Eastern-inflected spiritual chants, and most of the songs&#x27; lyrics reflected the now 41-year-old Sylvian&#x27;s inner peace resulting from his marriage, family, and beliefs. Guest musicians included long-time friend Ryuichi Sakamoto, classically trained tabla player Talvin Singh, avant-garde guitarist Marc Ribot, jazz trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, and contemporary jazz guitarist Bill Frisell. In 2010, Sylvian said, &quot;Since the early &#x27;80s I&#x27;ve been interested in deconstructing the familiar forms of popular song, in retaining the structure but removing the pillars of support. My work continually returns to this question: how much of the framework can you remove while still being able to identify what is, after all, a familiar form?&quot;

===2000 to 2009: Samadhi Sound===
Following &quot;Dead Bees&quot;, Sylvian released two compilation albums on Virgin Records: a two-disc retrospective, &quot;Everything and Nothing&quot; (2000), and an instrumental collection, &quot;Camphor&quot; (2002). Both albums contained previously released material, remixes and several new or previously unreleased tracks which Sylvian finished especially for the projects. Combined, the retrospective releases effectively marked a full stop to Sylvian&#x27;s association with Virgin, the split coming at the beginning of 2001.

Also in 2001, the track &quot;Linoleum&quot; was released on Tweaker&#x27;s album &quot;The Attraction to All Things Uncertain&quot;. Sylvian co-wrote and sang on the collaboration.

Sakamoto wanted some English lyrics for his project &quot;Zero Landmine&quot;, and asked Sylvian to write a simple, tender lyric that could be sung by children. Included on the release were various versions of the song, one being a Sylvian vocal with just the backing of Sakamoto&#x27;s piano.

In September 2001 Sylvian embarked on the &#x27;Everything and Nothing Tour&#x27;, which kicked off in Osaka on 17 September, and wound its way through Europe until 27 October that year. The tour continued into 2002, revisiting Japan and taking concerts to the US and Canada. Sylvian was accompanied on stage by Jansen, keyboard player Matt Cooper, guitarist Timothy Young and bassist Keith Lowe.

After Sylvian left Virgin Records he launched his own independent label, Samadhi Sound. He released the album &quot;Blemish&quot;, which included contributions from Christian Fennesz and Derek Bailey. Sylvian used a different approach with this album, starting each day in the studio with a very simple improvisation on guitar. Once recorded, he would listen back and use cues from the improv—the dynamic and so on—to dictate the structure of the piece. He wrote lyrics and melody on the spot, and would follow that up with the vocal recording.

Sylvian recorded the EP &quot;World Citizen&quot; with Sakamoto, which was released in Japan in October 2003, and in Europe in April 2004. Sylvian also collaborated with Chris Vrenna&#x27;s Tweaker again, on the track &quot;Pure Genius&quot;, which was released on the album &quot;2 a.m. Wakeup Call&quot;.

In the period 23 September 2003 to 27 April 2004 Sylvian toured in Europe and in Japan, on the &quot;Fire in the Forest Tour&quot; featuring Steve Jansen, with visuals and video images by Masakatsu Takagi.

In 2004, Sylvian was commissioned by Madhouse to compose the ending theme for the anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa&#x27;s &quot;Monster&quot;, titled &quot;For the Love of Life&quot;, alongside Japanese composer Kuniaki Haishima. Sylvian said that he was &quot;attracted to the &quot;Monster&quot; material by the moral dilemma faced by its central character.&quot;

Simultaneously Sylvian had started a project with Jansen and Berndt Friedman called Nine Horses. They released the album &quot;Snow Borne Sorrow&quot; in October 2005, and mini-album &quot;Money for All&quot; in January 2007.

Sylvian took to the road again on 17 September to 30 October 2007 for &#x27;The World Is Everything&#x27; tour, which included concerts in Europe, Hong Kong and Japan, featuring Steve Jansen, Keith Lowe, and Takuma Watanabe. A fusion of styles, including jazz and electronica, the tour enabled Sylvian to perform music from the Nine Horses project, as well as various selections from his back catalogue. Jansen also released his solo album &quot;Slope&quot; in 2007, with two tracks co-written by Sylvian: &quot;Ballad of a Dead Man&quot; (a duet with singer Joan Wasser), and &quot;Playground Martyrs&quot;.

A solo album entitled &quot;Manafon&quot; was released on 14 September 2009 in two editions – a regular CD/digipak edition and a twin boxset deluxe edition with two books that include the CD and a DVD featuring the film &#x27;Amplified Gesture&#x27;. &quot;Manafon&quot; featured contributions from leading figures in electroacoustic improvisation, such as saxophonist Evan Parker, multi-instrumentalist Otomo Yoshihide, laptop and guitarist Christian Fennesz, Polwechsel&#x27;s double bassist Werner Dafeldecker and cellist Michael Moser, sinewaves specialist Sachiko M and AMM alumni guitarist Keith Rowe, percussionist Eddie Prévost and pianist John Tilbury. In 2010, talking about &quot;Manafon&quot;, Sylvian said:&quot;What happened with &quot;Manafon&quot; was that the work abandoned me. As I was writing and developing the material, the spirit holding all these disparate elements together just left me. I sat stunned for a moment and then realised: It&#x27;s over; this is as far as it goes…In a sense, I&#x27;d been steadily working my way toward Manafon since I was a young man listening to Stockhausen and dabbling in deconstructing the pop song. Having said that, I don&#x27;t think we only develop as artists practising in our chosen fields. For me, that meant an exploration of intuitive states via meditation and other related disciplines which, the more I witnessed free-improv players at work, appeared to be crucially important to enable a being there in the moment, a sustained alertness and receptivity.&quot;

===2010 to present===
In 2010, Sylvian released &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;, a compilation album of his collaborative works with musicians over the previous 10 years, including songs with Ryuichi Sakamoto, Tweaker, Nine Horses, Steve Jansen, Christian Fennesz and Arve Henriksen. Also included were a few new songs, such as &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot; which was co-written with drummer Martin Brandlmayr of Radian and Polwechsel.

In 2011, the double album &quot;Died in the Wool&quot; was released as variations on the 2009 release &quot;Manafon&quot; with the addition of six new pieces, including collaborations with composer Dai Fujikura, producers Jan Bang and Erik Honoré, and a roster of contemporary musicians and improvisers. For the first time, a stereo mix of the audio installation &quot;When We Return You Won&#x27;t Recognise Us&quot; was available on CD, pairing a group of improvisers – John Butcher, Arve Henriksen, Günter Müller, Toshimaru Nakamura, and Eddie Prévost – with a string sextet directed by Fujikura.

Also in 2011, Sylvian acted as the artist in residence at the Punkt Festival in Norway. In addition to curating the events of the festival, Sylvian performed both compositions from the Holger Czukay-collaborated album &quot;Plight &amp; Premonition&quot;, backed by John Tilbury, Jan Bang, Phillip Jeck, Eivind Aarset, Erik Honoré, and Arve Henriksen. The positive reception led to the decision to tour throughout Europe in 2012. &quot;The Implausible Beauty&quot; tour was due to feature a line-up of musicians including Jan Bang, guitarist Eivind Aarset, pianist Sebastian Lexer, cellist Hildur Gudnadottir and trumpeter Gunnar Halle, but was cancelled in late January 2012 due to a back injury Sylvian had sustained.

In 2013, Sylvian released the single &quot;Do You Know Me Now?&quot;, a one-time vinyl pressing released with a re-mastered version of &quot;Where&#x27;s Your Gravity?&quot; on the B-side.

In 2014, Sylvian released &quot;There&#x27;s a Light That Enters Houses with No Other House in Sight&quot;, a long-form composition with contributions from Christian Fennesz and John Tilbury and featuring spoken word by American Pulitzer Prize winning poet Franz Wright of excerpts from Wright&#x27;s own &quot;Kindertotenwald&quot;.

In 2015, Sylvian released &quot;Playing The Schoolhouse&quot; with Confront Recordings in two limited editions. The release, a 15-minute long composition, was composed based on improvisations by Sylvian and Jan Bang – with contributions by Otomo Yoshihide and Toshimaru Nakamura – and was recorded in a schoolhouse in Norway. Sylvian collaborated again with Confront Recordings in 2017, with Mark Wastell (who runs Confront Recordings) and Rhodri Davies for the first release of the Confront Core Series, &quot;There Is No Love&quot;. The long-form composition was created with previously recorded materials, and features text from Bernard-Marie Koltès&#x27;s &quot;In the Solitude of Cotton Fields&quot;.

In July 2021 Grönland Records announced &#x27;ERR&#x27;, a photographic essay by Sylvian, with text by Shinya Fujiwara and an untitled original poem by Daisy Lafarge.

Sylvian contributed to the album &quot;To the Moon and Back&quot; (2022)&quot;,&quot; a tribute to Ryuichi Sakamoto recorded by various artists who reworked his material. In January 2023, Sylvian announced that a compilation of his Samadhisound works would be released later in 2023 as a boxset entitled &quot;Do You Know Me Now?&quot; on the Grönland Records label.

French actress Isabelle Adjani recorded a duet with David Sylvian, back in 2010, and it was finally included on her album with duets, &quot;Adjani Bande Originale,&quot; released on 10 November 2023. Sylvian sang on the track &quot;Il Manque Un Mot.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1992, while working on the Sakamoto single &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, Sylvian met Ingrid Chavez, a singer and actress who had been a member of Prince&#x27;s inner circle. That same year, the couple married and moved to Minneapolis. The couple have two daughters, Ameera-Daya (born 1993) and Isobel Ananda (born 1997). The family moved from Minneapolis, to a house outside of Sonoma, California, in 1997. They moved again, setting up a new home and studio in a property in Temple, New Hampshire, but Sylvian and Chavez were divorced in 2003.

 Sylvian lived in the woods of southern New Hampshire in the former site of an ashram, doing most of his work in a barn containing his home recording studio.

In July 2018, Sylvian said:

<text>The sharpbill (Oxyruncus cristatus) is a small passerine bird in the family Tityridae. Its range is from the mountainous areas of tropical South America and southern Central America (Panama and Costa Rica).

It inhabits the canopy of wet forest and feeds on fruit and some invertebrates. It has an orange erectile crest, black-spotted yellowish underparts and scaling on the head and neck. As its name implies, it has a straight, pointed beak, which gives its common name.

Sharpbills are most commonly found in tall dense forests but occasionally venture to the forest edge. Their diet consists of primarily of fruit, but they will also take insects, hanging upside down in from twigs to obtain insect larvae. They will also travel in mixed-species feeding flocks with ovenbirds, tanagers, woodpeckers and cotingas. The breeding system employed by this species is polygamous with closely grouped males displaying in from a lek. The nest of the sharpbill is built by the female and is a small cup built on a slender branch. Chicks are fed by regurgitation.

The genus &quot;Oxyruncus&quot; was erected by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1820. The sharpbill was described in 1821 by the English naturalist William Swainson under the binomial name &quot;Oxyrhuncus cristatus&quot; with an &quot;h&quot; inserted into the name of the genus. The word &quot;Oxyruncus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;oxus&quot; for &quot;sharp&quot; or &quot;pointed&quot; and &quot;rhunkhos&quot; &quot;bill&quot;. The specific epithet is from the Latin &quot;cristatus&quot; for &quot;crested&quot; or &quot;plumed&quot;.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the sharpbill occupies a basal position in a clade containing the Tityridae. The sharpbill is sometimes placed in its own family Oxyruncidae.

There are four subspecies:
* &quot;Oxyruncus cristatus frater&quot; (Sclater, PL &amp; Salvin, 1868) – Costa Rica and west Panama
* &quot;Oxyruncus cristatus brooksi&quot; Bangs &amp; Barbour, 1922 – east Panama
* &quot;Oxyruncus cristatus hypoglaucus&quot; (Salvin &amp; Godman, 1883) – southeast Venezuela, the Guianas and north Brazil
* &quot;Oxyruncus cristatus cristatus&quot; Swainson, 1821 – southeast Brazil, east Paraguay and northeast Argentina

<text>The lek (; indefinite singular &quot;lek&quot;, definite plural &quot;lekët&quot;, indefinite plural &quot;lekë&quot;; sign: L; code: ALL) is the currency of Albania. Historically, it was subdivided into 100 &quot;qintars&quot; (; singular &quot;qindarkë&quot;).

==History==

The lek was introduced as the first Albanian currency in February 1926.

Before then, Albania was a country without a currency, adhering to a gold standard for the fixation of commercial values. Before the First World War, the Ottoman Turkish piastre was in full circulation. During the occupation of Albania by Austria-Hungary, paper notes of the Austro-Hungarian krone were imposed on the population. Albanians were reluctant to use these notes and only did so in exchanges with the occupiers. The majority of the population used gold and silver piastre or, gave up on money altogether and bartered instead. In 1923 Italian paper circulated at Shkodër, Durrës, Vlorë, and Gjirokastër, and the Greek drachma at Korçë, the values of which varied according to locality and the prevailing rates of exchange as compared with gold.

===Gold standard===
From 1926–1939, the Albanian leke adhered to the gold standard &quot;de jure&quot; with leke banknotes being convertible to gold. The leke&#x27;s conversion to gold was guaranteed and the issue of gold francs was limited to three million units. Due to the gold standard, up until 1939, the leke did not experience significant inflation and the currency in circulation remained relatively constant. Following the Italian invasion of Albania, the entire gold reserves of Albania, totaling 300,000 gold francs, were confiscated and sent to the Reichsbank in Berlin. This action, coupled with the introduction of the Italian lira in Albania, led to significant inflation and the devaluation of the leke.

===Etymology===
The naming of this currency as &quot;Lek&quot; has two stories, one is that it is named after Alexander the Great, whose name is often shortened to &quot;Leka&quot; in Albanian. where Alexander&#x27;s portrait appeared on the obverse of the 1 lek coin, while the reverse showed him on his horse. Meanwhile, the other is that this currency was named after Lekë Dukagjini, which is considered the official reason based on parliamentary discussions in the Parliament of Albania in 1922. The word &quot;qindarkë&quot; comes from the Albanian &quot;qind&quot;, meaning one hundred, or from Arabic &quot;qintār&quot; (&quot;hundredweight&quot;). The word is thus comparable to &quot;centime&quot;, cent, Latin &quot;centenarius&quot;, etc.

===Franga===
Between 1926 and 1939, the main unit of Albanian currency was the &quot;franga ari&quot; (English: &quot;gold franc&quot;) (Fr.A.), worth 5 Lek and divided into 100 &quot;qindar ar&quot; (&quot;gold cent&quot;), used in international transactions. This unit was similar in concept to the &quot;Belga&quot;, a unit worth five Belgian francs.

==Coins==

===First lek===
In 1926, bronze coins were introduced in denominations of 5 and 10 qintars, together with nickel  Lek,  Lek and 1 Lek, and silver Fr.A. 1, Fr.A. 2 and Fr.A. 5 . The obverse of the franc coins depicts King Zog. In 1935, bronze 1 and 2 gold cents were issued, equal in value to the 5 and 10 qintars respectively. This coin series depicted distinct neoclassical motifs, said to have been influenced by the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III who was known to have been a coin collector. These coins depict the mint marks &quot;R&quot;, &quot;V&quot; or &quot;L&quot;, indicating Rome, Vienna or London.

Under the direction of Benito Mussolini, Italy invaded and occupied Albania and issued a new series of coins in 1939 in denominations of Lek 0.20, Lek 0.50, 1 Lek and 2  Lek in stainless steel, and silver 5 Lek, and 10 Lek. Aluminium-bronze Lek 0.05 and Lek 0.10 were introduced in 1940. A fixed exchange with the Italian lira was established at 5:6.25 (1 Lek = Lit.1.25, or Fr.A.1 = Lit.6.25). These coins were issued until 1941 and bear the portrait of Italian King Victor Emmanuel III on the obverse and the Albanian eagle with fasces on the reverse.

In 1947, shortly after the Communist Party took power, older coins were withdrawn from circulation and a new coinage was introduced, consisting of zinc  Lek, 1 Lek, 2 Lek and 5 Lek. These all depicted the socialist national crest. This coinage was again minted in 1957 and used until the currency reform of 1965.

===Second lek===
In 1965, a confiscatory monetary form was carried out at a rate of 10:1.

Aluminium coins (dated 1964) were introduced in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 qintars and 1 Lek. All coins show the socialist state emblem.

In 1969, a second series of aluminium 5, 10, 20, 50 qintars and 1 Lek coins was released commemorating the 1944 liberation from fascism. The three smallest denominations remained similar in design to the 1964 series but depicted &quot;1944-1969&quot; on the obverse. The 50 qintar and lek coins showed patriotic and military images.

In 1988, a third redesign of aluminium 5, 10, 20, 50 qintars and 1 Lek coins was released. The 50 qindarka and 1 Lek coins were problematically identical in size, weight, and appearance, so aluminium-bronze 1 Lek coins with the inscription &quot;Republika Popullore Socialiste e Shqipërisë&quot; were released later that year for better identification. In 1989, a cupro-nickel 2 Lek coin was introduced.

All three of these coin series remained in circulation during and shortly after the 1991 revolution. On 1 January 1992, those coins lost their legal tender status, effectively making qintars obsolete.

==== Foreign exchange certificates ====
Similar to many other socialist countries, Albania issued foreign exchange certificates, which only circulated in specially designated shops, and their exchange into regular lek banknotes was prohibited.

===Third lek===
In 1995 and 1996, new coins were introduced in denominations of 1 Lek, 5 Lekë, 10 Lekë, 20 Lekë and 50 Lekë, with a bimetallic 100 Lekë added in 2000.These coins use the letter &quot;e&quot; instead of the correct &quot;ë&quot;, but banknotes are spelt correctly.

====Commemorative coins====
In 2001, 100 Lekë and 200 Lekë were issued under the theme of Albania&#x27;s integration into the EU and 50, 100, and 200 lekë under the 500th anniversary of the Statue of David. In 2002, 50 Lekë and 100 Lek were issued for the 90th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania and 20 Lek under the Albanian Antiquity theme. In 2003, 50 lekë was issued in memory of the 100th anniversary of the death of Jeronim De Rada. In 2004, 50 Lekë was issued under the Albanian Antiquity theme depicting traditional costumes of Albania and the ancient Dea. In 2005, 50 Lekë were issued for the 85th anniversary of the proclamation of Tirana as capital and the theme of traditional costumes of Albania.

==Banknotes==

===First lek===
In 1926, the National Bank of Albania (&quot;Banka Kombëtare e Shqipnis&quot;) introduced notes in denominations of Fr.A. 1, Fr.A. 5, Fr.A. 20 and Fr.A. 100. In 1939, notes were issued in denominations of Fr.A. 5 and Fr.A. 20. These were followed in 1944 with notes for 2 Lek, 5 Lek, 10 Lek, and Fr.A. 100.

In 1945, the People&#x27;s Bank of Albania (&quot;Banka e Shtetit Shqiptar&quot;) issued overprints on National Bank notes for 10 Lek, Fr.A. 20 and Fr.A. 100. Regular notes were also issued in 1945 in denominations of 1, Fr.A. 5, Fr.A. 20, Fr.A. 100 and Fr.A. 500. In 1947, the franga-ari was discontinued and the lek was adopted as the main currency unit, with notes issued for 10 Lek, 50 Lek, 100 Lek, 500 Lek and 1000 Lek.

===Second lek===
In 1965, notes (dated 1964) were introduced by the Banka e Shtetit Shqiptar in denominations of 1 Lek, 3 Lek, 5 Lek, 10 Lek, 25 Lek, 50 Lek and 100 Lek. A second series of notes was issued in 1976 when the country changed its name to the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic.

====1992 series====
Due to the shortage of cash in circulation, in 1992, banknotes of 10 and 50 foreign currency leks (&quot;Lek Valutë&quot; ) were issued, while their value was increased 50 times: 10 foreign currency leks = 500 leks, 50 foreign currency leks = 2500 leks . The banknotes were in circulation for only one year and were soon replaced by banknotes of the 1992 model. A banknote of 1 currency lek was printed, but not put into circulation.
====1997 series====
On 11 July 1997, a new series of banknotes dated 1996-97 was introduced.

Notes dated 1996 were printed by De La Rue in the United Kingdom.

The 2000 lek note was introduced in 2008.

Since 2011 the 100 lek banknote has been removed out of circulation.

====2019–2022 series====
In 2019, the Bank of Albania unveiled a new series of banknotes, featuring the same themes as seen on the 1997 series, but with improved security features and a change in material for the 200 Lek banknote; now being issued as a polymer banknote.

This series has also introduced a new denomination, the 10,000 Lek, its highest denominated banknote issued for general circulation. The first two denominations issued for this series, the 200 and 5,000 lekë banknote were issued for circulation on 30 September 2019, with the 1,000 Lek and 10,000 Lek banknotes being released on 30 June 2021, and the 2,000 Lek and 500 Lek banknotes being released on 17 January 2022.

<text>The plantcutters are a group of passerine birds in the cotinga family, Cotingidae. They were previously in their own family, Phytotomidae. The three plantcutters are all placed in the genus Phytotoma.

These are robust birds of open woodland, scrub and farmland in southern and western South America. They resemble finches, and are among the few primarily folivorous birds, though they also take some fruits, berries and flowers. The common name is a reference to their stubby bills with fine serrations along the cutting edge – an adaptation for cutting plant material.

They are sexually dichromatic, with males having black wings with white patches, and at least partially rufous underparts. The plumage of the females is greyish-white or brownish-white with dense dark streaking throughout.

These pair-living birds lay 2 - 4 brown-spotted green eggs in a tree nest. Only the female incubates, but both sexes participate in the nest-building and feeding of the chicks. The chicks are fed almost exclusively with insects.

<text>Thomas Nashe (baptised 30 November 1567 – c. 1601; also Nash) was an Elizabethan playwright, poet, satirist and a significant pamphleteer. He is known for his novel &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot;, his pamphlets including &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;, and his numerous defences of the Church of England.

==Life==
Nashe was the son of the parson William Nashe and Janeth (née Witchingham). He was born and baptised in Lowestoft, on the coast of Suffolk, where his father, William Nashe, or Nayshe as it is recorded, was curate. Though his mother bore seven children, only two survived childhood: Israel (born in 1565) and Thomas.

The family moved to West Harling, near Thetford, in 1573 after Nashe&#x27;s father was awarded the living there at the church of All Saints. Around 1581 Thomas went up to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, as a sizar, gaining his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1586. From references in his own polemics and those of others, he does not seem to have proceeded Master of Arts there. Most of his biographers agree that he left his college about summer 1588, as his name appears on a list of students due to attend philosophy lectures in that year. His reasons for leaving are unclear; his father may have died the previous year, but Richard Lichfield maliciously reported that Nashe had fled possible expulsion for his role in &quot;Terminus et non-terminus&quot;, one of the raucous student theatricals popular at the time. Some years later, William Covell wrote in &quot;Polimanteia&quot; that Cambridge &quot;has been unkind to the one [i.e., Nashe] to wean him before his time.&quot; Nashe himself said he could have become a fellow had he wished (in &quot;Have With You to Saffron-Walden&quot;).

He moved to London and began his literary career. The remaining decade of his life was dominated by two concerns: finding employment and participating in controversies, most famously with Richard and Gabriel Harvey. He arrived in London with his one exercise in euphuism, &quot;The Anatomy of Absurdity&quot;. His first appearance in print was his preface to Robert Greene&#x27;s &quot;Menaphon&quot;, which offers a brief definition of art and overview of contemporary literature.

In 1590, he contributed a preface to an unlicensed edition of Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Astrophil and Stella&quot;, but the edition was called in, and the authorised second edition removed Nashe&#x27;s work.

Nashe was alive in 1599, when his last known work, &quot;Nashes Lenten Stuffe&quot;, was published, and dead by 1601, when he was memorialised in a Latin verse in &quot;Affaniae&quot; by Charles Fitzgeoffrey. It is not known where he died, or where he is buried. He is featured in Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;News from Hell&quot; (1606), and is referred to in the anonymous Parnassus plays (1598−1602), which provide this eulogy:

==In London, Marprelate controversy==
He was drawn into the Martin Marprelate controversy on the side of the bishops. As with the other writers in the controversy, his share is difficult to determine. He was formerly credited with the three &quot;Pasquill&quot; tracts of 1589–1590, which were included in R. B. McKerrow&#x27;s standard edition of Nashe&#x27;s works: however McKerrow himself later argued strongly against their being by Nashe. The anti-Martinist &quot;An Almond for a Parrot&quot; (1590), ostensibly credited to one &quot;Cutbert Curry-knave&quot;, is now universally recognised as Nashe&#x27;s work, although its author humorously claims, in its dedication to the comedian William Kempe, to have met Harlequin in Bergamo while returning from a trip to Venice in the summer of 1589. But there is no evidence Nashe had either time or means to go abroad, and he never subsequently refers to having visited Venice in his work.

==Feud with the Harvey brothers==
His friendship with Greene drew Nashe into the Harvey controversy, involving the brothers Richard and Gabriel Harvey. In 1590, Richard Harvey&#x27;s &quot;The Lamb of God&quot; complained of the anti-Martinist pamphleteers in general, including a side-swipe at the &quot;Menaphon&quot; preface. Two years later, Greene&#x27;s &quot;A Quip for an Upstart Courtier&quot; contained a passage on &quot;rope makers&quot; that clearly refers to the Harveys (whose father made ropes). The passage, which was removed from subsequent editions, may have been Nashe&#x27;s. After Gabriel Harvey mocked Greene&#x27;s death in &quot;Four Letters&quot;, Nashe wrote &quot;Strange News&quot; (1592). Nashe attempted to apologise in the preface to &quot;Christ&#x27;s Tears Over Jerusalem&quot; (1593), but the appearance of &quot;Pierce&#x27;s Supererogation&quot; shortly after offended Nashe anew. He replied with &quot;Have with You to Saffron-Walden&quot; (1596), with a possibly sardonic dedication to Richard Lichfield, a barber of Cambridge. Harvey did not publish a reply, but Lichfield answered in a tract called &quot;The Trimming of Thomas Nash,&quot; (1597). This pamphlet also contained a crude woodcut portrait of Nashe, shown as a man disreputably dressed and in fetters.

==Works==
While staying in the household of Archbishop John Whitgift at Croydon Palace in October 1592 he wrote an entertainment called &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot;, a &quot;show&quot; with some resemblance to a masque. In brief, the plot describes the death of Summer, who, feeling himself to be dying, reviews the performance of his former servants and eventually passes the crown on to Autumn. The play was published in 1600. Nashe is widely remembered for three short poems, all drawn from this play and frequently reprinted in anthologies of Elizabethan verse: “Adieu, farewell, earth’s bliss,” “Fair summer droops” and “Autumn hath all the summer’s fruitful treasure.” Nashe may also have contributed to &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, the play later published under Shakespeare&#x27;s name as the first part of the &quot;Henry VI&quot; trilogy. Gary Taylor believes that Nashe was the principal author of the first act. Nashe subsequently promoted the play in his pamphlet &quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;. In 1593 Nashe published &quot;Christ&#x27;s Tears Over Jerusalem&quot;, a pamphlet dedicated to Lady Elizabeth Carey. Despite the work&#x27;s apparently devotional nature it contained satirical material which gave offence to the London civic authorities and Nashe was briefly imprisoned in Newgate Prison. The intervention of Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s husband Sir George Carey gained his release.

He remained in London, apart from periodic visits to the countryside to avoid the plague—a fear reflected in the play &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot;, written in the autumn of 1592. William Sommers, whose comments frame the play, was Henry VIII&#x27;s jester. It includes the famous lyric:

In 1597 Nashe co-wrote the play &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot; with Ben Jonson. The work caused a major controversy for its &quot;seditious&quot; content. The play was suppressed and never published. Jonson was jailed; Nashe&#x27;s house was raided and his papers seized but he had already escaped to the country. He remained for some time in Great Yarmouth before returning to London.

===&quot;Pierce Penniless&quot;===
&quot;Pierce Penniless, His Supplication to the Divell&quot; is a tall tale, or a prose satire, published in 1592. It was among the most popular of the Elizabethan pamphlets. It was reprinted in 1593 and 1595, and in 1594 was translated into French.
It is written from the point of view of Pierce, a man who has not met with good fortune, who bitterly complains of the world’s wickedness, and addresses his complaints to the devil. At times the identity of Pierce seems to conflate with Nashe&#x27;s own. But Nashe also portrays Pierce at times as an arrogant fool. The story is told in a style that is complex, witty, anecdotal, and peppered with newly-minted words and Latin phrases. The satire can be mocking and bitingly sharp, and at times Nashe’s style seems to relish its own obscurity.

===&quot;The Choise of Valentines&quot;===
At some time in the early 1590s Nashe produced an erotic poem, &quot;The Choise of Valentines&quot; that begins with a sonnet to &quot;Lord S&quot;. It has been suggested that &quot;The Choise of Valentines&quot; was written possibly for the private circle of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby (then known as Lord Strange). It has alternatively been suggested that &quot;Lord S.&quot; refers to the Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare&#x27;s patron, just as Nashe had inscribed &quot;The Unfortunate Traveler&quot;, to &quot;Lord Henry Wriothesley Earl of Southampton&quot;.

&quot;The Choise of Valentines&quot; circulated only in manuscript. It describes the Valentine&#x27;s Day visit of a young man named &#x27;Tomalin&#x27; to the brothel where his lover, &quot;Mistris Francis&quot;, has recently become employed. Tomalin poses as a customer. Having paid ten gold pieces for her favours, Tomalin makes his way towards his erotic goal.

The object of his desire, &quot;A pretty rising womb&quot;, is revealed. Unfortunately Tomalin finds the moment so exciting that he &quot;spends&quot; his all before the &quot;fight&quot; has begun. Mistress Frances is disappointed and does what she can to revive things.

She perseveres in arousing him, is successful, and they make love. This begins a lengthy and witty erotic passage. But to her disappointment, Tomalin is prematurely satisfied—&quot;the well is drye that should refresh&quot;. Mistress Frances then decides to take matters into her own hands, reaches for the device of the poem&#x27;s informal title, &quot;Nashe&#x27;s Dildo&quot;.

This poem comes to an end with Tomalin ranting against the &quot;Eunike dilldo&quot; that has taken his place. It was sharply criticised for its obscenity by contemporary authors Joseph Hall and John Davies of Hereford. Nashe had tried to pre-empt criticism by placing it in the tradition of classical erotica: &quot;Yet Ovid&#x27;s wanton muse did not offend&quot;.

It appears not to have been Nashe&#x27;s only foray into this category of writing. When he was accused of &quot;prostituting&quot; his pen, he answered, in 1596, by writing:

On the question of what this poem might say about Nashe&#x27;s own sexuality, Nashe biographer Charles Nicholl, says &quot;not a lot perhaps&quot;, but points out that &quot;there is nothing second hand&quot; about Nashe&#x27;s &quot;evocations of sex.&quot;

===&quot;The Terrors of the Night&quot;===
In 1594, Nashe wrote a book titled &quot;The Terrors of the Night; Or A Discourse of Apparitions&quot;, which sceptically considers dreams, nightmares, and apparitions, which Nashe considers born of superstition, melancholy or imagination. He says, &quot;A dream is nothing else but a bubbling scum or froth of the fancy which the day hath left undigested, or an after-feast made of the fragments of idle imagination&quot;. He dismisses efforts to interpret dreams, saying &quot;What sense is there that the yolk of an egg should signify gold… that everything must be interpreted backward as Witches say their pater-noster, good being the character of bad, and bad of good.&quot; He disregards various spirits mentioning &quot;Robbin-good-fellowes, elves, fairies, hobgoblins&quot;. He does, however, see some possible value in visions (not dreams) that are heaven-sent, including the visions of Caesar and Alexander. Correspondence can be seen between the rationalism expressed in Act 5 of Shakespeare’s play &quot;Midsummer Night’s Dream&quot; and the ideas expressed in &quot;The Terrors of the Night&quot;; for example when Theseus in the play describes &quot;the poet’s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling&quot; and Nashe describes the constant &quot;wheeling and rolling on of our braines&quot;.

He is also credited with the erotic poem &quot;The Choise of Valentines&quot; and his name appears on the title page of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Dido, Queen of Carthage&quot;, though there is uncertainty as to what Nashe&#x27;s contribution was. Some editions of this play, still extant in the 18th century but now unfortunately lost, contained memorial verses on Marlowe by Nashe, who was his friend.

<text>The Burmese alphabet ( &quot;myanma akkha.ya&quot;, ) is an abugida used for writing Burmese. It is ultimately adapted from a Brahmic script, either the Kadamba or Pallava alphabet of South India. The Burmese alphabet is also used for the liturgical languages of Pali and Sanskrit. In recent decades, other, related alphabets, such as Shan and modern Mon, have been restructured according to the standard of the Burmese alphabet (see Mon–Burmese script.)

Burmese is written from left to right and requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability and to avoid grammar complications. There are several systems of transliteration into the Latin alphabet; for this article, the MLC Transcription System is used.

==Alphabet==

===History===
The Burmese alphabet was derived from the Pyu script, the Old Mon script, or directly from a South Indian script, either the Kadamba or Pallava alphabet. The earliest evidence of the Burmese alphabet is dated to 1035, while a casting made in the 18th century of an old stone inscription points to 984. Burmese calligraphy originally followed a square format but the cursive format took hold from the 17th century when popular writing led to the wider use of palm leaves and folded paper known as parabaiks. A stylus would rip these leaves when making straight lines. The alphabet has undergone considerable modification to suit the evolving phonology of the Burmese language.

===Arrangement===
As with other Brahmic scripts, the Burmese alphabet is arranged into groups of five letters for stop consonants called &quot;wek&quot; (ဝဂ်, from Pali ) based on articulation. Within each group, the first letter is tenuis (&quot;plain&quot;), the second is the aspirated homologue, the third and fourth are the voiced homologues and the fifth is the nasal homologue. This is true of the first twenty-five letters in the Burmese alphabet, which are called grouped together as &quot;wek byi&quot; (ဝဂ်ဗျည်း, from Pali ). The remaining eight letters (, , , , , , , ) are grouped together as &quot;a wek&quot; (အဝဂ်, ), as they are not arranged in any particular pattern.

===Letters===
A letter is a consonant or consonant cluster that occurs before the vowel of a syllable. The Burmese alphabet has 33 letters to indicate the initial consonant of a syllable and four diacritics to indicate additional consonants in the onset. Like other abugidas, including the other members of the Brahmic family, vowels are indicated in Burmese alphabet by diacritics, which are placed above, below, before or after the consonant character. A consonant character with no vowel diacritic has the inherent vowel (often reduced to when another syllable follows in the same word).

The following table provides the letter, the syllable onset in IPA and the way the letter is referred to in Burmese, which may be either a descriptive name or just the sound of the letter, arranged in the traditional order:
*ဃ (), ဈ (), ဋ (), ဌ (), ဍ (), ဎ (), ဏ (), ဓ (), ဘ (), and ဠ () are primarily used in words of Pali origin.
*ၐ () and ၑ () are exclusively used in Sanskrit words, as they have merged to စ in Pali.
*ည has an alternate form ဉ, used with the vowel diacritic ာ as a syllable onset and alone as a final.
*With regard to pronunciation, the corresponding letters of the dentals and alveolars are phonetically equivalent.
*In formal speech, ရ is often pronounced in words of Pali or foreign origin.
*အ is nominally treated as a consonant in the Burmese alphabet; it represents an initial glottal stop in syllables with no other consonant.
*The letter န (&quot;n&quot;) uses a different form when there is a diacritic under it like in နု (&quot;nu.&quot;)

Consonant letters may be modified by one or more medial diacritics (three at most), indicating an additional consonant before the vowel. These diacritics are:
*&quot;Ya pin&quot; (ယပင့်) – Written ျ (MLCTS &quot;-y-&quot;, indicating /j/ medial or palatalization of a velar consonant (, , , ))
*&quot;Ya yit&quot; (ရရစ်) – Written ြ (MLCTS &quot;-r-&quot;, indicating /y/ medial or palatalization of a velar consonant)
*&quot;Wa hswe&quot; (ဝဆွဲ) – Written ွ (MLCTS &quot;-w-&quot;, usually indicating /w/ medial)
*&quot;Ha hto&quot; (ဟထိုး) – ှ (MLCTS &quot;h-&quot;, indicating that a sonorant consonant is voiceless)

A few Burmese dialects use an extra diacritic to indicate the /l/ medial, which has merged to /j/ in standard Burmese:
*&quot;La hswe&quot; (လဆွဲ) – Written ္လ (MLCTS &quot;-l&quot;, indicating /l/ medial

All the possible diacritic combinations are listed below:

==Stroke order==
Letters in the Burmese alphabet are written with a specific stroke order. The letter forms of the Burmese script are based on circles. Typically, one circle should be done with one stroke, and all circles are written clockwise. Exceptions are mostly letters with an opening on top. The circle of these letters is written with two strokes coming from opposite directions.

The ten following letters are exceptions to the clockwise rule: ပ, ဖ, ဗ, မ, ယ, လ, ဟ, ဃ, ဎ, ဏ. Some versions of stroke order may be slightly different.

The Burmese stroke order can be learned from ပထမတန်း မြန်မာဖတ်စာ ၂၀၁၇-၂၀၁၈ (&quot;Burmese Grade 1, 2017-2018&quot;), a textbook published by the Burmese Ministry of Education. The book is available under the LearnBig project of UNESCO. Other resources include the Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Northern Illinois University and an online learning resource published by the Ministry of Education, Taiwan.

==Syllable rhymes==
Syllable rhymes (i.e. vowels and any consonants that may follow them within the same syllable) are indicated in Burmese by a combination of diacritic marks and consonant letters marked with the virama character ် which suppresses the inherent vowel of the consonant letter. This mark is called &quot;asat&quot; in Burmese (, ), which means &quot;nonexistence&quot; (see Sat (Sanskrit)).


==Diacritics and symbols==
One or more of these accents can be added to a consonant to change its sound. In addition, other modifying symbols are used to differentiate tone and sound, but are not considered diacritics.

===History===
&quot;La hswe&quot; () was used in old Burmese from the Bagan to Innwa periods (12th century – 16th century), and could be combined with other diacritics (&quot;ya pin&quot;, &quot;ha hto&quot; and &quot;wa hswe&quot;) to form   . Similarly, until the Innwa period, &quot;ya pin&quot; was also combined with &quot;ya yit&quot; to form . From the early Bagan period to the 19th century, was used instead of for the rhyme . Early Burmese writing also used , not the high tone marker , which came into being in the 16th century. Moreover, , which disappeared by the 16th century, was subscripted to represent creaky tone (now indicated with ). During the early Bagan period, the rhyme (now represented with the diacritic ) was represented with ). The diacritic combination disappeared in the mid-1750s (typically designated as Middle Burmese), having been replaced with the combination, introduced in 1638. The standard tone markings found in modern Burmese can be traced to the 19th century.

===Stacked consonants===
Certain sequences of consonants are written one atop the other, or &quot;stacked&quot;. A pair of stacked consonants indicates that no vowel is pronounced between them.

For example, the word (&quot;kambha&quot;), which means &quot;world&quot;, contains the stacked consonant (&quot;m-bh&quot;). The first consonant is (&quot;m&quot;) and the second consonant is (&quot;bh&quot;). No vowel is pronounced between &quot;m&quot; and &quot;bh&quot;.

When stacked, the first consonant is written normally (i.e., not super- or subscripted). It has an implied &quot;virama&quot; and is the final of the preceding syllable. In the case of , an implied virama is applied to the first consonant (), which is the final of the preceding syllable , producing (&quot;kam&quot;).

The second consonant is subscripted beneath the first consonant and is the onset of the following syllable. In the case of , is the second consonant and is the onset of (the following syllable), producing (&quot;bha&quot;).

The equivalent form of is thus read (&quot;kambha&quot;). If the (&quot;m&quot;) and (&quot;bh&quot;) were not stacked (i.e., ), the pronunciation would be different as the inherent vowel &quot;a&quot; would apply to the (i.e., &quot;kamabha&quot;).

Stacked consonants are always homorganic (pronounced in the same place in the mouth), which is indicated by the traditional arrangement of the Burmese alphabet into the seven five-letter rows of letters (called ). Consonants not found in the rows beginning with or can only be doubled — that is, stacked with themselves.

Stacked consonants are largely confined to loan words from languages like Pali, Sanskrit, and occasionally English. For instance, the Burmese word for &quot;self&quot; (via Pali ) is spelt , not , although both would be read the same.

Stacked consonants are generally not found in native Burmese words, with a major exception being abbreviations. For example, the Burmese word &quot;daughter&quot; is sometimes abbreviated to , even though the stacked consonants do not belong to the same row in the and a vowel is pronounced between. Similarly, &quot;tea&quot; is commonly abbreviated to . Also, &quot;ss&quot; is written , not .

==Numerals ==
A decimal numbering system is used, and numbers are written in the same order as Hindu–Arabic numerals.

The digits from zero to nine are: ၀၁၂၃၄၅၆၇၈၉ (Unicode 1040 to 1049). The number 1945 would be written as ၁၉၄၅. Separators, such as commas, are not used to group numbers.

==Punctuation==
There are two primary break characters in Burmese, drawn as one or two downward strokes: ၊ (called ပုဒ်ဖြတ်, ပုဒ်ကလေး, ပုဒ်ထီး, or တစ်ချောင်းပုဒ်) and ။ (called ပုဒ်ကြီး, ပုဒ်မ, or နှစ်ချောင်းပုဒ်), which respectively act as a comma and a full stop. There is a Shan exclamation mark ႟. Other abbreviations used in literary Burmese are:
* ၏ – used as a full stop if the sentence immediately ends with a verb.
-possessive particle( &#x27;s, of)
* ၍ – used as a conjunction.
* ၌ – locative (&#x27;at&#x27;).
* ၎င်း – ditto (used in columns and lists)

==Unicode==

Myanmar script was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

The Unicode block for Myanmar is U+1000–U+109F:

<text>A lek is an aggregation of male animals gathered to engage in competitive displays and courtship rituals, known as lekking, to entice visiting females which are surveying prospective partners with which to mate. It can also refer to a space used by displaying males to defend their own share of territory for the breeding season. A lekking species is characterised by male displays, strong female mate choice, and the conferring of indirect benefits to males and reduced costs to females. Although most prevalent among birds such as black grouse, lekking is also found in a wide range of vertebrates including some bony fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and arthropods including crustaceans and insects.

A classical lek consists of male territories in visual and auditory range of each other. An exploded lek, as seen in the kākāpō (the owl parrot), has more widely separated territories, but still in auditory range. Lekking is associated with an apparent paradox: strong sexual selection by females for specific male traits ought to erode genetic diversity by Fisherian runaway, but diversity is maintained and runaway does not occur. Many attempts have been made to explain it away, but the paradox remains.

== Etymology ==
The term derives from the Swedish &quot;lek&quot; (), a noun which typically denotes pleasurable and less rule-bound games and activities (&quot;play&quot;, as by children), or from the Swedish verb &quot;leka&quot;, to play. Written English use of &quot;lek&quot; dates from the late 1860s and early 1870s. Llewelyn Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Game birds and wild fowl of Sweden and Norway&quot; (1867) introduces it (capitalised and in single quotes, as &#x27;Lek&#x27;) explicitly as a Swedish term.

==Taxonomic range==

Lekking was originally described in the Tetraonidae (grouse, boldface in cladogram), in particular the black grouse (Swedish: &quot;orrlek&quot;) and capercaillie (Swedish: &quot;tjäderlek&quot;), but it is widely distributed phylogenetically among other birds, and in many other animal groups within the vertebrates and the arthropods, as shown in the cladogram.

The presence of a group name means that &quot;some&quot; species in that group lek; groups with no lekking members are not shown.

==Lekking behaviour==

===Types===

There are two types of lekking arrangement: classical and exploded. In the classic lekking system, male territories are in visual and auditory range of their neighbours. In an exploded lek, males are further away from one another than they would be in a classical lek. Males in an exploded lek are outside visual range of one another, but they stay within earshot. Exploded lek territories are much larger than classic systems and more variable in size. A well-known example of exploded leks is the &quot;booming&quot; call of the kākāpō, the males of which position themselves many kilometres apart from one another to signal to potential mates.

===Stability===

Lek territories of different taxa are stable and do not vary in terms of size and location. Males often return to the same mating sites because of female fidelity. Avian females such as the black grouse and great snipe are faithful to males and not to mating sites. Successful males congregate in the same area as the previous breeding season because it is familiar to them, while females return to reunite with their males. Females do not return to a mating site if their male partner is not present. Another possible explanation for lek stability is from male hierarchies within a lek. In some species of manakin, subordinate betas may inherit an alpha&#x27;s display site, increasing the chances of female visitation. Rank may also contribute to the stability of lek size, as lower ranking males may congregate to achieve a perceived optimal size to attract females.

===Female mating preferences===

A meta analysis of 27 species found that qualities such as lekking size, male display rate, and the rate of male aggression exhibit positive correlation with male success rates. A positive correlation was also found between attendance, magnitude of exaggerated traits, age, frequency of fights, and mating success. This female preference leads to mating skew, with some males being more successful at copulating with females. The variation in mating success is quite large in lek mating systems with 70–80% of matings being attributed to only 10–20% of the males present.

==Costs and benefits==


The main benefit for both sexes is mating success. For males, the costs stem from females&#x27; preferences. The traits that are selected for may be energetically costly to maintain and may cause increased predation. For example, increased vocalization rate caused a decrease in the mass of male great snipes. Other costs can derive from male combat. For example, male great snipes regularly fight to display dominance or defend their territory, with females preferring victorious males. Aggressive male black grouse are preferred over non-aggressive males and when the males fight they tear feathers from each other&#x27;s tails. Lekking is associated with sexual dimorphism across a range of bird taxa.

At first glance, it may seem that females receive no direct benefits from lekking, since the males are only contributing genes to the offspring in the absence of parental care or other benefits. However, lekking reduces the cost of female searching because the congregating of males makes mate selection easier. Females do not have to travel as far, since they are able to evaluate and compare multiple males within the same vicinity. Further, having the males in one place may reduce the amount of time a female is vulnerable to predators. When under predatory pressure, female marbled reed frogs consistently choose leks near their release sites; high male calling rates were observed to reduce female search time.

==The lek paradox==

Since sexual selection by females for specific male trait values should erode genetic diversity, the maintenance of genetic variation in lekking species constitutes a paradox in evolutionary biology. Many attempts have been made to explain it away, but the paradox remains. There are two conditions in which the lek paradox arises. The first is that males contribute only genes and the second is that female preference does not affect fecundity. Female choice should lead to directional runaway selection, resulting in a greater prevalence for the selected traits. Stronger selection should lead to impaired survival, as it decreases genetic variance and ensures that more offspring have similar traits. However, lekking species do not exhibit runaway selection. In a lekking reproductive system, what male sexual characteristics can signal to females is limited, as the males provide no resources to females or parental care to their offspring. This implies that a female gains indirect benefits from her choice in the form of &quot;good genes&quot; for her offspring.

Amotz Zahavi argued that male sexual characteristics only convey useful information to the females if these traits confer a handicap on the male. Zahavi&#x27;s handicap principle may offer a resolution to the lek paradox, for if females select for the condition of male ornaments, then their offspring have better fitness. Another potential resolution to the lek paradox is Rowe and Houle&#x27;s theory that sexually selected traits depend on physical condition, which might in turn, summarize many genetic loci. This is the genic capture hypothesis, which describes how a significant amount of the genome is involved in shaping the traits that are sexually selected. There are two assumptions in the genic capture hypothesis: the first is that sexually selected traits are dependent upon condition, and the second is that general condition is attributable to high genetic variance. In addition, W. D. Hamilton and Marlene Zuk proposed that sexually selected traits might signal resistance to parasites. One resolution to the lek paradox involves female preferences and how preference alone does not cause a drastic enough directional selection to diminish the genetic variance in fitness. Another conclusion is that the preferred trait is not naturally selected for or against and the trait is maintained because it implies increased attractiveness to the male. 

==Evolution==

Several possible mechanisms have been proposed as to why males cluster into leks, including the hotshot, hotspot, black hole, kin selection, and predation protection hypotheses, as described below.

===Hotshot hypothesis===

The hotshot hypothesis is the only model that attributes males as the driving force behind aggregation. The hotshot model hypothesizes that attractive males, known as hotshots, garner both female and male attention. Females go to the hotshots because they are attracted to these males. Other males form leks around these hotshots as a way to lure females away from the hotshot. A manipulative experiment using the little bustard, &quot;Tetrax tetrax&quot;, was done to test the various lek evolution models. The experiment involved varying the size and sex ratio of leks using decoys. To test whether or not the presence of a hotshot determined lek formation, a hotshot little bustard decoy was placed within a lek. After the fake hotshot was added to the lek, both male and female visitation to the lek increased, giving weight to the hypothesis.

===Hotspot model===

The hotspot model considers the female density to be the catalyst for the clustering of males. This model predicts that leks will form where females tend to reside as a way to increase female interaction. Female manakin traffic has been observed to be concentrated around leks, bathing sites, and fruiting areas, with males aggregated near the most visited fruiting resources. The hotspot model also predicts that lek size is dependent upon the number of females inhabiting a patch of land. To test if the number of females affects lek formation, a group of female little bustard decoys were added to a lek. The presence of these female decoys did not have an effect on lek size, tending to refute the hypothesis.

===Blackhole model===

The blackhole model proposes that females have a preference for neither size nor type of male, but rather that females tend to be mobile and mate wherever leks may be located. This model predicts that female mobility is a response to male harassment. This prediction is difficult to test, but there was a negative correlation found between male aggressiveness and female visitation in the little bustard population, suggesting that the model might be correct. Evidence supporting the black hole model is mainly found in ungulates.

===Kin selection===
An alternative hypothesis for lekking is kin selection, which assumes that males within a lek are related to one another. As females rarely mate outside of leks, it is advantageous for males to form leks. Although not all males within a lek mate with a female, the unmated males still receive fitness benefits. Kin selection explains that related males congregate to form leks, as a way to attract females and increase inclusive fitness. In some species, the males at the leks show a high degree of relatedness, but this does not apply as a rule to lek-forming species in general. In a few species such as peacocks and black grouse, leks are composed of brothers and half-brothers. The lower-ranking males gain some fitness benefit by passing their genes on through attracting mates for their brothers, since larger leks attract more females. Peacocks recognize and lek with their brothers, even if they have never met before.

=== Predation protection ===

Another hypothesis is predation protection, or the idea that there is a reduction in individual predation risk in a larger group. This could work both for the males within the group and any female who visits the lek. Protection also explains the presence of mixed leks, when a male of one species joins a lek of another species for protection from a common set of predators. This occurs with manakins, as well as other birds such as grouse species.

<doc id="264443" wikidata="Q3999824" url="?curid=264443" title="True (Spandau Ballet album)">
<text>True is the third studio album by English new wave band Spandau Ballet, released on 4 March 1983 by Chrysalis Records. The band&#x27;s songwriter/guitarist Gary Kemp realised after the release of their second album that the nightclub audience they initially wanted to attract had lost interest in them in part because of the band&#x27;s transition from dance music to pop. He no longer felt obligated to keep writing music for them and shifted his focus to soul and R&amp;B influences such as Marvin Gaye and Al Green for this album. Kemp thought that bandmate Steve Norman&#x27;s newfound interest in the saxophone would be well-suited to the sound he was going for, as would the decision to record most of the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas.

After an unsuccessful attempt to begin work on the album with producer Trevor Horn, the band tested out their working relationship with Tony Swain and Steve Jolley while recording its first single, &quot;Lifeline&quot;, and chose to produce the album alongside them. &quot;Lifeline&quot; was a top ten hit on the UK Singles Chart, and its follow-up, &quot;Communication&quot;, also did well. The album became available as the second single climbed the charts, and the overwhelming response to the title track dictated its release as the third single from the album, leading it to four weeks as the most popular song in the UK. It also became their first song to appear on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, where it peaked at number four. A fourth single, &quot;Gold&quot;, reached number two in the UK but only got as high as 29 in the US, which Kemp attributed to internal conflicts at their record label that took time away from promoting the band.

On the album charts, &quot;True&quot; reached number one in the UK and number 19 in the US while also having success in numerous other countries. It achieved platinum certification for sales of 300,000 units in the UK less than three months after its release. Most critics thought the album was enjoyable, but there were those who found something or much to dislike. The choice of suits for the album photos and &quot;True&quot; music video was thought to have misled US audiences by presenting them as too clean cut to have much else to offer other than soul ballads like the title song.

==Background, development and recording==

When Spandau Ballet first formed, their guitarist/songwriter Gary Kemp had been aware of how previous generations of Britain&#x27;s youth culture had bands representing them, such as the Mods having the Who and the Small Faces. He wanted people to associate Spandau with the fashion-wise clientele of a popular Tuesday night London gathering called the Blitz, and had written songs that sounded like what was played there, what he described as &quot;white European dance music&quot;.

Their first album, &quot;Journeys to Glory&quot;, was a successful culmination of this style of material that Kemp had written at his own pace and that had been tested in front of the Blitz crowd over an extended period of time, but coming up with songs for their second effort, &quot;Diamond&quot;, was more challenging. Although following a renewed interest in funk gave them a number 3 UK hit with its first single, &quot;Chant No. 1 (I Don&#x27;t Need This Pressure On)&quot;, the writer&#x27;s block Kemp suffered as it climbed the UK Singles Chart resulted in his mimicking its use of horns and group vocals for the next single, &quot;Paint Me Down&quot;, which had a number 30 showing in the UK, the lowest peak position there of any of their singles to date. An experiment with the eastern European sound from American film scores for the third single, &quot;She Loved Like Diamond&quot;, fared even worse just as &quot;Diamond&quot; was about to be released; that inspired the idea to take another song from the album, &quot;Instinction&quot;, and hire a new producer to remix it in the hope that it would perform better. Kemp described that track as being the closest thing to a pop song that Spandau Ballet had yet recorded. The band hired Buggles founder Trevor Horn to do the new arrangement of the song, which reached number ten in the UK and made Kemp realise that the clubgoers they had initially catered to were no longer interested in their music. He was now able to write songs without concern for their danceability or adherence to current tastes. In his autobiography &quot;I Know This Much: From Soho to Spandau&quot;, he explained, &quot;The freedom of not having to write just for Soho meant I could dive into that great big reservoir of pop, deep with melody and soul, and hopefully surface with the pearls I wanted.&quot;

Because of the rebound the band experienced with Horn&#x27;s reworking of &quot;Instinction&quot;, the plan was to have him produce the next album. He was especially impressed with one of Kemp&#x27;s recent compositions, &quot;Pleasure&quot;, and wanted to start working with the band on it immediately. The rehearsal went well, and they began recording it at AIR Studios with the mindset that it would be the first single from the new album, which was initially called &quot;The Pleasure Project&quot;. On the first day of recording, however, Horn had drummer John Keeble redo the track repeatedly over the course of the ten-hour day to try to get it perfect and called Kemp that evening to offer to programme the drums and suggest that they get a new drummer. Kemp was stunned by the suggestion: &quot;I heard myself saying that programming the drums would not just be psychologically wrong for our team spirit, but it would also undermine John as a player.&quot; He refused Horn, who decided not to continue working with them. Later in 1982 Kemp told &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine, &quot;We couldn&#x27;t have worked with Trevor because he was too overpowering, too dogmatic.&quot;

The band&#x27;s manager, Steve Dagger, suggested producers Tony Swain and Steve Jolley, who recently had success with Bananarama, and Kemp performed some of the songs he had just written for the duo with the plan of having them produce the first single from the new album to see if they had a good working relationship with the band. While Swain was leaning toward &quot;Communication&quot; as the best choice for their next hit song, Jolley insisted that they work on the &quot;up-tempo, more obvious pop sing-along&quot; &quot;Lifeline&quot;. The band was credited alongside Jolley and Swain as producers of &quot;Lifeline&quot; and would be on the album as well.

&quot;Lifeline&quot; was recorded at Red Bus Studios in Paddington as Spandau Ballet got a feel for their new producers, but they worked on the rest of the album at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas because of the soul music that had been recorded there and because Kemp felt that the tropical surroundings would help give the music the feeling he was trying to achieve. The band rehearsed before they travelled there, and lead singer Tony Hadley recorded his vocals at Red Bus upon their return.

==Songs==

In a &quot;Mastertapes&quot; interview with John Wilson in 2013, Kemp contrasted the anti-establishment, anticommercial stance of the punk scene with the plan that Spandau Ballet initially had of having similar attitudes in their dress and style of music but selling enough records to make the pop charts at the same time. He felt that their appearances on the British music chart television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; contributed to their assimilation into a more mainstream sound and explained that, because of his realisation that their music no longer interested the nightclub crowd after the release of &quot;Instinction&quot;, &quot;There was a sense of, &#x27;We have to move on from here.&#x27;&quot; He told Wilson how their desire to expand to a broader audience inspired the &quot;True&quot; lyric &quot;I bought a ticket to the world&quot;. In 2012 he told &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;We were leaving the London club scene and starting to sell records around the world, so the next album really needed to be pop.&quot;
In 1981 the band recorded &quot;Chant No. 1&quot; with the British jazz-funk group Beggar and Co acting as their horn section, and Steve Norman, who had been the band&#x27;s guitarist and percussionist on its first two albums, subsequently felt inspired to take up the saxophone. Kemp recalled he and Norman enjoying hearing the instrument as teenagers on songs by Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder as well as the hit &quot;Shame&quot; by Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King. Kemp decided that their foray into pop on the new album would use the saxophone in the same vein as the soul music they enjoyed growing up. Once he found this new direction for their music, he suddenly had the urge to write several songs. In an early 1983 interview with &quot;Record Mirror&quot; magazine, he confessed feeling that the songs for this album were the best that he had ever written and explained that he went back to writing what sounded good with just an acoustic guitar. He discussed the difficulty of trying to focus on more personal subjects without sounding derivative and how he had overcome his fear of being honest in his music. He said, &quot;I honestly wanted to make an album that would cross all ages and become timeless. I said to Tony Swain, &#x27;I like Daryl Hall and John Oates, and I want the album to sound as smooth as that but with a British edge to it.&#x27; I think it&#x27;s got that.&quot;

===&quot;True&quot;===
In 1981, Kemp met Altered Images lead singer Clare Grogan and, despite already having a girlfriend, found himself infatuated with her because of their common interests. By the time he started writing songs for the album, he was primarily listening to music by Marvin Gaye and Al Green and wanted to write a blue-eyed soul version of their style of music that was based on his own experience. Grogan had given him a copy of the novel &quot;Lolita&quot; by Vladimir Nabokov as a gift, so he incorporated a couple of phrases he had underlined while reading it into the lyrics – &quot;pill on my tongue&quot; and &quot;seaside limbs&quot;, which became &quot;seaside arms&quot; – in order to convey his feelings in a way that she would recognise. He told Wilson he was still getting questioned about the meaning of &quot;seaside arms&quot; or criticised for his paraphrasing of the expression.

===&quot;Gold&quot;===
Once Kemp decided to start writing pop songs, the first idea he chose to explore was paying homage to film scores as he had attempted on &quot;She Loved Like Diamond&quot;, only this time focusing specifically on John Barry and his work on the James Bond series. The title of the song, &quot;Gold&quot;, was inspired by Shirley Bassey&#x27;s 1964 hit Bond theme &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Because he and his brother, Martin, who was the bassist for the band, were still living with their parents as he began writing songs for the album, it was convenient to have his brother listen to what he had just written and play it with him on his bass to see if it sounded like what he intended, and this song was one Martin loved.

==Cover art==
Kemp was competing for Grogan&#x27;s attention with Altered Images cover artist David Band and asked him to work with Spandau Ballet on the design for the new album. Because they were both seeing their careers take off during their attempts to court Grogan, they went camping together a few times in the English Lake District as a way of escaping their success. Kemp recalled, &quot;We first started to devise a cover together for the &quot;True&quot; album when we were up in the mountains, in one of the pubs one evening. He was drawing in his sketchbook and a dove appeared, this little dove.&quot; Band later added alongside it the outline of a man&#x27;s head with a brimmed hat, which the band loved; a variation was used for the sleeve of the &quot;True&quot; single. His work was described as &quot;a marker for the look of the time, a jazz-influenced style that could also be seen in an exaggerated fashion in the New Romantic look.&quot; Kemp credits him with having &quot;the skill of coming up with simple, figurative graphics that would set a visual tone for the decade.&quot; In 2012 he told &quot;The Herald&quot;:
==Release and commercial performance==
&quot;True&quot; was released on 4 March 1983 and received silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry on 9 March for reaching the 60,000 units of shipment threshold. It entered the UK Albums Chart on 12 March to begin a chart run of 90 weeks, one of which was at number 1. Gold certification for reaching 100,000 units was issued on 11 April, and platinum (300,000 units) came the following month on 23 May. It also reached the top spot in the Netherlands and New Zealand and performed well in other countries. In the US, the album debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart in the issue dated 14 May 1983 and peaked at number 19 during a 37-week run.

To commemorate its 20th anniversary, a remastered version of &quot;True&quot; was released on 29 April 2003 as a single CD with the original eight tracks along with the music video for &quot;Gold&quot; and some home video footage of the band. The original 8-track album was also issued in 2003 on the high-resolution super audio CD format as a Hybrid SACD (in stereo only). In 2008, the album was given away free with copies of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper. In June 2010, a special edition was released on 2 CDs with a DVD as part of the 2010 Spandau Ballet reissues series, featuring remastered 12″ remixes and B-sides, plus a live concert.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine gave the album a positive review upon its release in the US, noting that &quot;Pleasure&quot; and &quot;Code of Love&quot; &quot;linger with the fresh feel of new music while owing to swing era rhythms, even MOR.&quot; Most reviewers at the time, however, qualified their praise. Parke Puterbaugh of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;You can shut your eyes while listening to &quot;True&quot; and almost imagine that Spandau Ballet has had nothing to do with clothes, makeup or any fashion-show pseudoevents&quot; and concluded that the album was &quot;a sleekly executed, surprisingly affecting record, and welcome proof that bunch of clotheshorses can place high in the musical stakes, too.&quot; Don Mackay of &quot;Rip It Up&quot; also summed up his comments with a reference to their vestiary history: &quot;While still some distance short of profundity, the result is generally pleasant enough with tracks like &#x27;Communication&#x27;, &#x27;Lifeline&#x27; and &#x27;Foundation&#x27; at least proving that the Ballet really can dance. Perhaps there&#x27;s life in the old clotheshorses yet.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ira Robbins also counted &quot;Communication&quot; and &quot;Lifeline&quot; as album highlights, adding, &quot;The remaining six cuts aren&#x27;t as noteworthy, but at least aren&#x27;t objectionable or off-putting.&quot; Dave Rimmer of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; conceded that &quot;there&#x27;s nothing here as awful as, say, &#x27;[She Loved Like] Diamond&#x27;, but on the other hand nothing as brilliant as &#x27;Chant No. 1&#x27;. &quot;True&quot; is less interesting than previous Spandau LPs, but much more enjoyable.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot;&#x27;s Betty Page warned,Enter into &quot;True&quot; with a mind truly free of preconceptions, and you&#x27;ll wallow in a chunk of creamy, dreamy funk with satisfyingly rounded edges. Turn a cynical eye to who you&#x27;re dealing with and where they&#x27;ve come from and you&#x27;ll find plenty of cannon fodder.

Gavin Martin of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; wrote a long, scathing review of the album, which he opened by describing the band as &quot;slimy&quot; and &quot;ingratiating&quot; with &quot;opportunist, vaguely plagiaristic whims and indulgences&quot;. He called the album &quot;milksop funk pap&quot;, &quot;bland feckless goo&quot; and &quot;doleful emasculation&quot;. Regarding Kemp&#x27;s songwriting, he wrote,Despite all the talk of inner strength and celebrations of the highlife elsewhere, the music is stale and rigid with a backline that fairly grinds along where it should be bright and alert.
As a pop band Spandau are too pedestrian, too tied up in their own self-important world to provide a sharp/indignant/imaginative insight to the times; and as a &quot;soul&quot; band, well, they&#x27;re fooling no one.

Retrospective reviews were mixed. Paul Evans wrote a brief summary review of most of their album discography in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; and gave &quot;True&quot; three stars out of five without much to recommend. At his most complimentary, he opined, &quot;Tony Hadley developed a way of vocalizing that joined the heavy dramatics of Bryan Ferry to the lounge act &#x27;feeling&#x27; of a Gary Puckett or a bad Bobby Darin.&quot; Of all their albums, he concluded, &quot;&quot;True&quot; remains creepily fascinating.&quot; Dan LeRoy of AllMusic complimented &quot;the growing skill of guitarist Gary Kemp, the band&#x27;s primary songwriter, who crafted a set of tunes aimed squarely at the charts.&quot; Like Rimmer, however, he did not find anything as interesting as their previous UK hits:Some listeners at the time called the album an MOR sellout, but its slick surfaces remain tough to resist, and while none of the cuts generate the excitement of past singles like &quot;To Cut a Long Story Short&quot; or &quot;Chant No. 1,&quot; &quot;True&quot; remains Spandau Ballet&#x27;s most consistent and best all-around album.

==Singles and videos==
Swain and Jolley&#x27;s selection for their tryout as producers, &quot;Lifeline&quot;, became the first single released from the album and debuted on the UK Singles Chart dated 2 October 1982. It peaked at number 7 during its 9 weeks there and reached the pop charts in other countries. In the US it &quot;bubbled under&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot 100 to number 108, and it was paired with &quot;Communication&quot; when it appeared on their Dance/Disco Top 80 chart. The US chart appearances coincided with the airing of the music video on MTV in the spring of 1983. Critics were divided, with some finding it bland and others appreciating the R&amp;B-style vocals.

The album was completed in December 1982, but Kemp explained that when the next single needed to be chosen, the band&#x27;s manager, Steve Dagger, &quot;didn&#x27;t want to go with a ballad next and recommended another up-tempo first. &#x27;Communication&#x27; got the band vote. Why we didn&#x27;t go straight for &#x27;True&#x27; or &#x27;Gold&#x27; as the next single, I&#x27;m not sure. Maybe we felt their success would be automatic and wanted to save them for later, during the album&#x27;s release.&quot; &quot;Communication&quot; debuted on the UK Singles Chart on 12 February 1983 and reached number 12 over the course of 10 weeks. It also charted in other countries, and, in addition to its dance chart pairing with &quot;Lifeline&quot; in the US in the spring of 1983, it made the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the spring of 1984, after &quot;True&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot;, the third and fourth singles from the album, completed their chart runs there. Reviews were mostly good; some critics complimented Hadley&#x27;s vocals and appreciated what they felt was a scaled-back approach, but others still found it overdone. The music video for the song was made to look like a theatrical film, and, in order to increase his visibility, Hadley was the only band member to appear in it.

The title song began 15 weeks on the UK Singles Chart in April 1983 and spent four weeks at number one. It also went to the top spot in Canada and Ireland and made the top ten in several other countries, including the US, where it got as high as number four on the Hot 100 and spent a week at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart. It received a variety of responses from critics, with some finding it flawless and others disliking it. Hadley felt that their choice to wear suits for the music video had given their US audience a misleading first impression since &quot;True&quot; was very different from the hits they had elsewhere.

&quot;Gold&quot; was the fourth UK single from the album and spent nine weeks on the pop chart there, two of which were at number two. Although it made the top ten in several other countries, it only got as high as number 29 in the US. The music video alternated shots of the band performing the song with a storyline in which Hadley played a character who wandered the sun-baked streets and outskirts of Carmona, Spain, searching for pieces that made up a gold puzzle. Critics were again in disagreement as some showed appreciation, others contempt.

Chrysalis wanted to release &quot;Heaven Is a Secret&quot; as a fifth single in the UK; however the band refused this. In limited European release at the end of 1983, &quot;Pleasure&quot; reached number 27 in the Netherlands, number 32 in Belgium, and number 61 in West Germany. In reviews of the album, &quot;Pleasure&quot; elicited the same divided response as some of the previous singles. Page described it as &quot;smoothly mournful&quot;, but Martin used the song&#x27;s lyrics as an example of Kemp &quot;attempting to present characters that are strong and noble with dignity and high moral purpose&quot;, concluding, &quot;Even [Spandau Ballet&#x27;s] leisure time becomes a virtual religious experience.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The number 29 showing by &quot;Gold&quot; in the US was the first signal to Kemp that Chrysalis America was not promoting them. &quot;Communication&quot; only reached number 59 in the US in 1984, and &quot;Only When You Leave&quot;, the first single from their next album, &quot;Parade&quot;, became their last Hot 100 entry when it peaked at number 34 later that year. Kemp was unhappy with those performances as well and blamed the low numbers on a perceived conflict between Chrysalis founders Chris Wright and Terry Ellis distracting them from promotional efforts. Wright refused to license the band to a bigger label in the US, so they sought legal advice to get out of their contract. The disappointing chart performance in the US led Spandau Ballet to leave Chrysalis for CBS Records, which released their &quot;Parade&quot; follow-up, &quot;Through the Barricades&quot;, in 1986.

Hadley felt that the band&#x27;s inability to sustain the interest of the American public resulted from a few other factors working against them, primarily that their big US hit was very different to what they had already succeeded with elsewhere. Kemp had said in an interview before &quot;Gold&quot;&#x27;s US release that he hoped it would give Americans a more balanced view of Spandau Ballet. Although some American concert attendees knew their old songs, he hoped their upcoming US tour would show the rest who came that &quot;True&quot; was not the sort of song they normally did.

In retrospect, however, Hadley felt they needed to spend several months touring the US so that more audiences could hear that back catalogue and not doing so also hurt their record sales there. They played &quot;True&quot; at the 1985 Live Aid concert, but instead of using their brief time on stage to showcase one of their earlier hits, Dagger wanted them to play &quot;Virgin&quot; from their upcoming &quot;Through the Barricades&quot; album, which even Kemp admitted was not a good idea. Hadley felt Dagger was inexperienced, but whenever he suggested getting a manager with more knowledge about the business, the rest of the band balked.

Kemp told &quot;Creem&quot; in 1984 that he would continue to write for the larger audience Spandau Ballet had acquired with &quot;True&quot; but it would not be making albums that sounded like the last just because it did well. But, just as he had developed writer&#x27;s block in 1981 after &quot;Chant No. 1&quot; became their highest-charting single, having a UK number one put pressure on Kemp to churn out more chart-topping hits and left him feeling that the band would always judge his future output against &quot;True&quot;. When the &quot;Through the Barricades&quot; album and its singles failed to chart in the US, Kemp chided himself for exploring so many genres and not simply trying to write more hit songs that were imitations of &quot;True&quot;.

<text>Clifton Avon &quot;Cliff&quot; Edwards (June 14, 1895 – July 17, 1971), nicknamed &quot;Ukulele Ike&quot;, was an American musician and actor. He enjoyed considerable popularity in the 1920s and early 1930s, specializing in jazzy renditions of pop standards and novelty tunes. He had a number one hit with &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; in 1929. He also did voices for animated cartoons later in his career, and he is best known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) and &quot;Fun and Fancy Free&quot; (1947), and Dandy (Jim) Crow in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941).

==Early life and musical career==
Edwards was born in Hannibal, Missouri. He left school at age 14 and soon moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and Saint Charles, Missouri, where he entertained as a singer in saloons. As many places had pianos in bad shape or none at all, Edwards taught himself to play ukulele to serve as his own accompanist (choosing it because it was the cheapest instrument in the music shop). He was nicknamed &quot;Ukulele Ike&quot; by a club owner who could never remember his name. He got his first break in 1918 at the Arsonia Cafe in Chicago, Illinois, where he performed a song called &quot;Ja-Da&quot;, written by the club&#x27;s pianist, Bob Carleton. Edwards and Carleton made it a hit on the vaudeville circuit. Vaudeville headliner Joe Frisco hired Edwards as part of his act, which was featured at the Palace in New York City—the most prestigious vaudeville theater—and later in the Ziegfeld Follies.
Edwards made his first phonograph records in 1919. He recorded early examples of jazz scat singing in 1922. The following year he signed a contract with Pathé Records. He became one of the most popular singers of the 1920s, appearing in several Broadway shows. He recorded many of the pop and novelty hits of the day, including &quot;California, Here I Come&quot;, &quot;Hard Hearted Hannah&quot;, &quot;Yes Sir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot;.

In 1924, Edwards performed as the headliner at the Palace, the pinnacle of his vaudeville success. That year he also featured in George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s first Broadway musical &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;, alongside Fred and Adele Astaire. As a recording artist, his hits included &quot;Paddlin’ Madeleine Home&quot; (1925), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything but Love&quot; (1928), and the classic &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1929), which he introduced. Edwards&#x27;s own compositions included &quot;(I&#x27;m Cryin&#x27; &#x27;Cause I Know I&#x27;m) Losing You&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re So Cute (Mama o&#x27; Mine)&quot;, &quot;Little Somebody of Mine&quot;, and &quot;I Want to Call You &#x27;Sweet Mama&#x27;&quot;. He also recorded a few &quot;off-color&quot; novelty songs for under-the-counter sales, including &quot;I&#x27;m a Bear in a Lady&#x27;s Boudoir&quot;, &quot;Mr. Insurance Man&quot;, and &quot;Give It to Mary with Love&quot;.

Edwards, more than any other performer, was responsible for the soaring popularity of the ukulele.
Millions of ukuleles were sold during the decade, and Tin Pan Alley publishers added ukulele chords to standard sheet music. Edwards always played American Martin ukuleles, favoring the small soprano model in his early career. In his later years, he moved to the larger tenor ukulele, which was becoming popular in the 1930s.

Edwards continued to record until shortly before his death in 1971. His last record album, &quot;Ukulele Ike&quot;, was released posthumously on the independent Glendale label. He reprised many of his 1920s hits; his failing health was however evident in the recordings.

==Film, radio, and television==
In 1929, Cliff Edwards was playing at the Orpheum Theater in Los Angeles where he caught the attention of movie producer-director Irving Thalberg. His film company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Edwards to appear in early sound movies. After performing in some short films, Edwards was one of the stars in the feature &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;, doing some comic bits and singing some numbers, including the film debut of his hit &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. He appeared in a total of 33 films for MGM through 1933. He had a small role as Mike, playing a ukulele very briefly at the beginning of the 1931 movie &quot;Laughing Sinners&quot; (1931), starring Joan Crawford.

Edwards had a friendly working relationship with MGM&#x27;s comedy star Buster Keaton, who featured Edwards in three of his films. Keaton, himself a former vaudevillian, enjoyed singing and harmonized with Edwards between takes. One of these casual jam sessions was captured on film, in &quot;Doughboys&quot; (1930), in which Keaton and Edwards scat-sing their way through &quot;You Never Did That Before&quot;.

Edwards was also an occasional supporting player in feature films and short subjects at Warner Bros. and RKO Radio Pictures. He played a wisecracking sidekick to Western star George O&#x27;Brien, and he filled in for Allen Jenkins as &quot;Goldie&quot; opposite Tom Conway in &quot;The Falcon Strikes Back&quot;. In a 1940 short, he led a cowboy chorus in &quot;Cliff Edwards and His Buckaroos&quot;. Throughout the 1940s he appeared in a number of &quot;B&quot; Westerns playing the comic, singing sidekick to the hero, seven times with Charles Starrett and six with Tim Holt.

Edwards appeared in the darkly sardonic Western comedy &quot;The Bad Man of Brimstone&quot; (1937), and he played the character &quot;Endicott&quot; in the screwball comedy film &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940). In 1939, he voiced the off-screen wounded Confederate soldier in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in a hospital scene with Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland.

His most famous voice role was as Jiminy Cricket in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940), where he sings &quot;Give a Little Whistle&quot; and &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;. Edwards&#x27;s rendition of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; is probably his most familiar recorded legacy. He voiced the head crow in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Dumbo&quot; (1941) and sang &quot;When I See an Elephant Fly&quot;.

In 1932, Edwards had his first national radio show on CBS Radio. He continued hosting network radio shows through 1946. In the early 1930s, however, Edwards&#x27; popularity faded as public taste shifted to crooners such as Russ Columbo, Rudy Vallee, and Bing Crosby.

Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s use of the ukulele spurred a surge in its popularity and those that played it, including Edwards. Like many vaudeville stars, Edwards was an early arrival on television. In the 1949 season, he starred in &quot;The Cliff Edwards Show&quot;, a three-days-a-week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings) TV variety show on CBS. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he made appearances on &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;, in addition to performing his Jiminy Cricket voice for various Disney shorts and the Disney Christmas spectacular, &quot;From All of Us to All of You&quot;.

==Personal life==
Edwards was careless with the money he made in the 1920s, always trying to sustain his expensive habits and lifestyle. He continued working during the Great Depression, but never again enjoyed his former prosperity. Most of his income went to alimony for his three former wives, and paying debts, and he declared bankruptcy four times during the 1930s and early 1940s. Edwards married his first wife Gertrude (Benson) Ryrholm in 1917. Their marriage ended in divorce four years later. He married Irene Wylie in 1923; they divorced in 1931. In 1932, he married his third and final wife, actress Judith Barrett. They divorced in 1936.

As well as being a lifelong heavy tobacco smoker, Edwards also was an alcoholic, a drug addict and a gambler for much of his career.

==Later years and death==
In his final years, Edwards lived in a home for actors and often spent his time at the Walt Disney Studios to be available any time he could get voice work. He was sometimes taken to lunch by animators whom he befriended and told stories of his days in vaudeville.

Edwards died on July 17, 1971, at the age of 76 from a cardiac arrest brought on by arteriosclerosis. At the time of his death, Edwards was a penniless charity patient at the Virgil Convalescent Hospital in Hollywood, California. His body was unclaimed and was donated to the University of California, Los Angeles medical school. When Walt Disney Productions, which had been quietly paying many of his medical expenses, discovered this, they offered to purchase his remains and pay for the burial. Instead, it was done by the Actors&#x27; Fund of America (which had also aided Edwards) and the Motion Picture and Television Relief Fund. Disney paid for his grave marker.

==Honors==
In 2000, Edwards was awarded as a Disney Legend for voice-acting. In 2002, Edwards&#x27; 1940 recording on Victor, Victor 26477, &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot;, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

<text>LunarStorm, in Swedish often shortened to Lunar, was a Swedish commercial advertisement-financed social networking website for teenagers, which was also available in the United Kingdom before 2007. &quot;LunarStorm&quot; was operated by a company called LunarWorks. According to the company&#x27;s official statistics, the website had 1.2 million members in 2007, of whom some 70% were 12–17 years old. The website drastically dropped in popularity since then and in June 2010, Wyatt Media Groups (the owner of LunarStorm at that time) announced that LunarStorm would be shut down on 18 August 2010 due to lack of activity.

==History==
The predecessor to Lunarstorm was called &quot;StajlPlejs&quot; (i.e. &quot;Style Place&quot; transcribed to Swedish spelling), which started around 1996. It was created by Rickard Eriksson as Europe&#x27;s first digital online community. Lunarstorm officially opened on 1 January 2000, after Lunarworks had taken over StajlPlejs and decided to rename it after the username used at the website by Rickard Erikssons girlfriend.

In 2001, LunarStorm had grown to over 600,000 members but still experienced economic hardships. After the beginning, LunarStorm was financed by banners and other advertising on the website, but this soon evolved to include more of pay-by-SMS services. An early example was LunarStorm&#x27;s own pre-paid card &quot;Vrål&quot; (&quot;Roar&quot;). In 2002, &quot;Kolla&quot; (&quot;Look&quot; or &quot;Check this out&quot;) was introduced which allowed users to visit LunarStorm from their mobile phones. In the same year, members were able to upgrade their membership to &quot;pro&quot; status and get unlimited access to a range of services for a fee. LunarStorm Pro was extremely popular among the member base and it improved the website&#x27;s economic situation greatly.

Another great source of revenue was LunarStorm&#x27;s cooperation with other companies. An early business partner was OLW who sponsored &quot;RajRaj&quot;, a party-oriented photo album (&quot;RajRaj&quot; being Swedish slang for party). But LunarStorm has through the years also cooperated with numerous other companies including Arla, EA Games, Loka, McDonald&#x27;s, Coca-Cola, Aftonbladet, Sveriges Radio and Logitech.

In September 2006, the website style was changed. The change had already been introduced at the British sister site a few months earlier (May - June).

In February 2007, LunarWorks bought 40 percent of the shares in Bilddagboken, an increasingly big competitor to LunarStorm. At the same time, LunarStorm replaced the &quot;Kollage&quot; service which allowed you to upload images for a fee with the free &quot;Gallery&quot;, to compete with Bilddagbokens free picture upload functions. Eight months later, on 4 October 2007, the owners of LunarStorm announced that they had bought the remaining shares of Bilddagboken, as well as 57 percent of the online Swedish-English dictionary Tyda.se. LunarStorm, Bilddagboken and Tyda.se are now parts of Wyatt Media Group, owned by Sten Mörtstedt.

Both the Danish and British branches of the website were closed down on 13 July 2007.

On 13 December 2007, LunarStorm removed &quot;Pro&quot; from the website and made all the content free. Focus was instead put on a new function called &quot;Club Lunar&quot; where members got access to &quot;exclusive offers&quot; and &quot;cool competitions&quot;. Lately, the popularity of LunarStorm has dramatically decreased which the owners explain with an increased competition from other social networking sites for young people in Sweden such as Bilddagboken. For example, the daily question that used to be answered by about 150 000 members per day and was used by polling institutes to study opinions of Swedish youth has now shrunk to about 10,000 - 12,000 daily answers, as of summer 2009. The number of users concurrently online went from about 100,000 to only 1,500 as of 2009.
