<text>Julian Solís De Jesus (born 7 January 1957) is a former boxer from Puerto Rico. He was born in the San Juan area of Río Piedras, but because of the closeness of his birthplace to Caguas, he often trained at the Bairoa Gym in Caguas. His training base, however, was the Caimito Gym.

A former Lineal and WBA Bantamweight champion, Solis is the only world champion in a family that produced two other world-class boxers: brother Enrique was outpointed by WBA Featherweight champion Eusebio Pedroza in 1978, and brother Rafael was knocked out in five rounds by WBC Super featherweight champion Héctor Camacho in 1983.

==Professional boxing career==
The son of Jose Julian Solis and of Gloria De Jesus, Solis began his professional boxing career in 1975, outpointing Ray Negron in four on 11 November. He won his first five fights in Puerto Rico, and then had his first international fight in December 1975, when he beat Juan Gómez in St. Maarten by a knockout in round two. On 12 February 1978, he met fringe contender Nivio Nolasco, outpointing him over ten rounds, and travelled to the Dominican Republic, where on 15 March he outpointed Leopoldo Frias also in ten rounds. With a record of 12-0 and 5 knockouts, he returned to the Dominican Republic, where he challenged Julio Soto Solano on 16 October for the &quot;Latin American Bantamweight title&quot;, winning the regional belt by outpointing Solano over 12 rounds.

==World bantamweight championship==
In 1979, he won four fights, including one over Julio C. Saba knocked out in eight rounds in Buenos Aires. Solis continued on his travels in 1980. He retained the Latin American title with a 12th-round knockout of future world title challenger Edgar Roman in Venezuela, won a fight in South Africa, and challenged the Lineal and WBA Bantamweight champion Jorge Lujan in Miami on 29 August, winning on points.

For his first defense, Solis returned to Miami, but he lost the belt and his undefeated record to Jeff Chandler on November 14 when he was knocked out in the fourteenth round. After beginning 1981 with a win, he met Chandler again on 25 July, at Atlantic City, New Jersey. This time Chandler did the job in half the time, knocking out Solis in the seventh round. His next fight, with Kiko Bejines (later to die in a boxing related accident) in Los Angeles, also resulted in a seventh-round knockout defeat.

Solis started 1982 by winning two fights in San Juan and another one in Chile. By 1983, he was a popular performer in televised fights, often held in small Puerto Rican cities. He won four fights in Puerto Rico that year, and drew in Panama with the Number One ranked super bantamweight, Bernardo Checa. In 1984, he won three fights, including a ten-round decision over future world champion Kenny Mitchell on the 8 December undercard of the Azumah Nelson - Wilfredo Gómez WBC Featherweight championship bout in San Juan. In 1985, Solis fought only once, outpointing David Campo. He began 1986 by losing on points to Mike Ayala over ten rounds on 2 March in San Antonio. Solis and his handlers felt he had been robbed of a victory by the judges in this fight, feeling that Solis had done enough to win. They filed a complaint with the Texas state athletic commission, but in vain, as the officials reviewed a tape of the fight and decided the result should stand.

Solis fought on from this point, but he only won six of his last fifteen bouts before retiring in 1992. True to his globe-trotting style, only two of those bouts were in Puerto Rico, and he visited Italy, South Korea, South Africa once again, Miami and various American states. Among the boxers he faced during the last part of his career were future world Bantamweight champion Maurizio Stecca, former world Bantamweight champion Calvin Grove, Seung-Hoon Lee and Pedro Decima.

Solis retired with a record of 41 wins, 13 losses and 1 draw, with 22 knockouts. He remains active as a public figure in Puerto Rico, participating in charity exhibitions here and there.

==Professional boxing record==

==Later life==
In 2010, Solís was injured in a shooting incident.

<doc id="267068" wikidata="Q3476676" url="?curid=267068" title="Black Orchid (character)">
<text>Black Orchid is a superheroine published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #428 (cover-dated July 1973).

The character has undergone numerous changes in her biography and powers over the years. Initially, her identity was a mystery, and her primary power was mastery of disguise, often impersonating background female characters. Various speculations about her origins were presented, but ultimately refuted.

In 1988, writer Neil Gaiman introduced an origin story for Black Orchid, giving her the name Susan Linden-Thorne and the background of a human-plant hybrid, connected to other DC Universe plant-human hybrids like Swamp Thing and Poison Ivy. After Linden was murdered by her abusive husband, her DNA was used to create plant-human hybrids, one of which took up her mantle after Linden&#x27;s death. The character was relaunched again in 1993 as Flora Black, with the ability to manipulate pheromones and control minds, making her a femme fatale. This series saw Flora&#x27;s demise and a younger version, Suzy, taking up the mantle of Black Orchid. In the 2011 reboot of DC&#x27;s continuity, The New 52, a new version of the character named Alba Garcia was introduced. Alba is a former army private whose arms were amputated, and she transforms into a purple Swamp Thing-like creature. Her powers involve the ability to shape-shift and manipulate elemental forces.

Throughout all the different versions, the powers of the Black Orchid character have varied but generally include super strength, flight, durability, and the power of disguise or shape-shifting.

==Development==
When designing Black Orchid, artist Tony DeZuñiga took inspiration from &quot;Cymbidium canaliculatum&quot;, a plant with dark purple petals, and Black Condor. He stated that he &quot;read the character description and [recalled that] in the ’40s there was this character called the Black Condor, but [since] that was a male superhero, [he] took some ideas and revised [it] to a female form.&quot;

==Fictional character biographies==
===Susan Linden-Thorne===
Although she has a number of superpowers (including flight, super-strength, and invulnerability to bullets) her main ability is a mastery of disguise. She often spends an entire investigation impersonating a seemingly insignificant female background character, with the other characters only discovering her involvement at the end of the story upon finding the woman she impersonated and an abandoned disguise with her calling card, a black orchid.

After appearing in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #428–430, a backup feature starring the character ran in &quot;The Phantom Stranger&quot; #31–32, 35–36, and 38–41 (1974–1976). Black Orchid subsequently appeared sporadically, including cameos in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, &quot;Blue Devil&quot;, &quot;Deadshot&quot;, and &quot;Invasion!&quot;. She had a larger role in &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; as a member of the eponymous team. She also had an appearance in the non-continuity children&#x27;s comic book &quot;Super Friends&quot; #31.

While &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #428 proclaimed on its cover that it was an &quot;origin issue&quot;, almost no background on the character was given, not even her name. Until Neil Gaiman described her origin, the character was known for her lack of an origin. Instead, writers teased the audience with several possible origins, all refuted. In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #429, Barry DeMorte hypothesizes that either yoga master Lucinda &quot;Cindy&quot; Harper or anti-gravity specialist Daphne Wingate is Black Orchid, and he kidnaps both. When Black Orchid comes to the rescue, he learns otherwise. In &quot;The Phantom Stranger&quot; #38, writer Michael Fleisher posited racecar driver Ronnie Kuhn as a possible secret identity for Black Orchid. In the next issue, Kuhn is revealed to be an admirer of Black Orchid and member of the &quot;Black Orchid Legion&quot;, a group of scientists and criminals who developed suits to mimic Black Orchid&#x27;s powers. In a non-canon &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic, civilian Lisa Patrick believes that Black Orchid is a Kryptonian and attempts to kill her with Kryptonite.

In &quot;Blue Devil Annual&quot; #1, Madame Xanadu and Phantom Stranger provide competing origins for Black Orchid, which respectively parody Daredevil and Spider-Man.

In 1988, the character was relaunched in the three-issue miniseries &quot;Black Orchid&quot;, written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Dave McKean. The series identifies Orchid as Susan Linden-Thorne, who is killed by her abusive husband Carl and returns as a human-plant hybrid who believes itself to be her.

===Flora Black===
The surviving Black Orchids, both having the consciousness and limited memories of Linden, become as mother and daughter, one being significantly smaller and younger than the other, and although the younger is initially more aware of Linden&#x27;s memories, these swiftly degenerate. The elder goes under the alias of Flora Black to meet with Sherilyn Sommers, her closest friend.

An ongoing &quot;Black Orchid&quot; series, published under the Vertigo Comics imprint, featuring the new Black Orchid, ran for 22 issues from 1993 to 1995. Written by Dick Foreman, it saw the second version of the character use pheromone manipulation as mind control to become a femme fatale, breaking and marrying millionaire Elliot Weems to claim his fortune and company business as her own. She then became the series&#x27; major villain in the closing story arc, before perishing in the final issue. Her companion, a child version of Black Orchid heretofore nicknamed &quot;Suzy&quot;, had matured over the course of the series, taking up the mantle of the Black Orchid as a young adult. Suzy features prominently in &quot;The Black Orchid Annual&quot; #1, part 2 of Vertigo&#x27;s &quot;The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; crossover. The Annual was published between issues #4 and #5 of the ongoing series.

===Suzy===
The grown-up Suzy is identical to her &quot;sister&quot; and carries on the tradition in both the DC Universe and related Vertigo titles. She has appeared in four event titles: 1999&#x27;s &quot;Totems&quot; one-shot, &quot;Justice Leagues&quot; (2001), &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; (2005), and &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2006). She is at present an ally of the Shadowpact and the Birds of Prey.

An unidentified Black Orchid appears in &quot;Trinity&quot; as a member of an alternate universe Justice League.

===Alba Garcia===
A new Black Orchid resembling the original (with a slightly modernized costume) appears in &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot. In this new timeline, she is assigned to the Justice League Dark by Steve Trevor and is an agent of A.R.G.U.S. Her name has been revealed to be Alba Garcia, a former army private whose arms had been amputated. She transforms into a purple Swamp Thing-like creature after being trapped in another dimension.

==Powers and abilities==
The first Black Orchid had superhuman physical abilities, flight, and was a master of disguise. The second and third Black Orchids had super strength, flight, and could absorb nutrients from the air. The second version could also generate seductive pheromones and was seen to change her eye pigmentation, commenting that skin, hair, and eye color were easy for adjust (presumably linking back to her predecessors&#x27; disguise ability).

&quot;The New 52&quot; version of the character can shapeshift by channeling the Red and the Green.

<doc id="267070" wikidata="Q800212" url="?curid=267070" title="White-cheeked pintail">
<text>The white-cheeked pintail (Anas bahamensis), also known as the Bahama pintail or summer duck, is a species of dabbling duck that is spottily distributed throughout South America and the Caribbean. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name.

==Taxonomy==
The white-cheeked pintail was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Anas bahamensis&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;Ilathera duck&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in the first volume of his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; that was published between 1729 and 1732.

Three subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;A. b. bahamensis&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – West Indies and north South America
* &quot;A. b. rubrirostris&quot; Vieillot, 1816 – south Ecuador and south Brazil to north Argentina and north Chile
* &quot;A. b. galapagensis&quot; (Ridgway, 1890) – Galápagos Islands

==Description==
Like many southern ducks, the sexes are similar. It is mainly brown with white cheeks and a red-based grey bill (young birds lack the pink). It cannot be confused with any other duck in its range.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is found in the Caribbean, South America, and the Galápagos Islands. It occurs on waters with some salinity, such as brackish lakes, estuaries and mangrove swamps.

==Behaviour==
The white-cheeked pintail feeds on aquatic plants (such as &quot;Ruppia&quot;), grass seeds, algae and small creatures (such as insects and small aquatic invertebrates) obtained by dabbling. The nest is on the ground under vegetation and near water.

==Aviculture==
It is popular in wildfowl collections, and escapees are frequently seen in a semi-wild condition in Europe. A leucistic (whitish) variant is known in aviculture as the silver Bahama pintail.

<text>A Gift Upon the Shore is a post-apocalyptic fiction novel by American author M. K. Wren and published by Ballantine Books in 1990. The story follows two American women, an artist and a writer, who survive pandemic, the collapse of civilization, and a deadly nuclear winter.

==Plot summary==
Set in the near future, A Gift traces the first generations to survive nuclear war and its aftermath. Writer Mary Hope and painter Rachel Morrow scratch out a meager existence on a farm called Amarna on the Oregon coast. They are determined to collect and preserve for a new civilization all the great books of western culture. Farther down the coast lives the Arkites, a fundamentalist group that denies all knowledge not found in the Bible. After a plague strikes the Arkites Mary agrees to take in a few survivors on the condition that she be allowed to educate the children as she sees fit.

==Reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the novel &quot;unsparing but ultimately hopeful...Wren&#x27;s post-nuclear world rings true, as do her compelling depictions of the subsistence-level daily life--the triumphs, the losses and the desperation.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; dubbed the novel as &quot;Beautifully realized, with solid characters, but unoriginal, obvious, implausible, obtrusively symbolic, and far too slow in the development: more admirable than practical.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commented: &quot;This cautionary novel is scarier than anything by Stephen King or Clive Barker...Wren’s writing is clear and concise for the most part, though bordering on the mystic when it comes to her descriptions of the woods, and especially the ocean in its many moods.&quot;

<doc id="267087" wikidata="Q197930" url="?curid=267087" title="Zhongxing New Village">
<text>Zhongxing New Village, sometimes rendered as Chunghsing New Village is an urban village located in Nantou City, Nantou County, Taiwan (ROC) and was the seat of government of Taiwan Province until the abolition of the Taiwan Provincial Government in 2018. The term &quot;zhōngxīng&quot; is from a Chinese legend (), referring to the restoration of the Xia dynasty by king Shao Kang, an allusion to the ROC government taking back mainland China.

It is a planned town with a population of 25,549 as of February 2010. With all the buildings owned by the government, development is strictly controlled and carefully planned.

==History==
Taipei, the temporary capital and the seat of government of the Republic of China (Taiwan), was also the capital of Taiwan Province from September 1945 until 1956. Ground was broken on the village on 4 November 1955, and branches of the government began moving on 5 July 1956. The provincial government held its first meeting at Zhongxing New Village on 27 November 1957, and the provincial administration building began use on 1 July 1957.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), which has ruled the Chinese mainland since 1949, who also claimed the island of Taiwan, does not recognize the move of the provincial government from Taipei to Zhongxing New Village as legitimate. Thus, the PRC publishes Taipei as the claimed provincial capital on its official maps. Zhongxing New Village, according to the PRC&#x27;s administrative divisions, is classified as a residential community under the Nantou Subdistrict.

==Research development==
There are plans for an industrial innovation park to be set up in the planned zone in the city; domestic research institutes have been invited to open innovation and incubation centers there. In addition, a market intelligence technology center is also planned for the development of green intelligence mobile technologies through cloud computing.

The park is scheduled to begin construction after the completion of an environmental impact assessment in 2011. It is estimated to cost NT$10.7 billion (US$367.5 million) to construct, and will house 250 research and development units and provide 13,000 new jobs. No manufacturing activities will be conducted at the park, which will instead focus on emerging and advanced industrial technology.

<doc id="267088" wikidata="Q2303196" url="?curid=267088" title="The Chrysalids">
<text>The Chrysalids (United States title: Re-Birth) is a science fiction novel by British writer John Wyndham, first published in 1955 by Michael Joseph. It is the least typical of Wyndham&#x27;s major novels, but regarded by some as his best. An early manuscript version was entitled &quot;Time for a Change&quot;.

The novel was adapted for BBC radio by Barbara Clegg in 1982, with a further adaptation by Jane Rogers in 2012. It was also adapted for the theatre by playwright David Harrower in 1999.

==Plot summary==

The inhabitants of post-apocalypse Labrador have vague knowledge of the &quot;Old People&quot;, a technologically advanced civilization they believe was destroyed when God sent &quot;Tribulation&quot; to the world to punish their forebears&#x27; sins. The inhabitants practise a form of fundamentalist Christianity; they believe that to follow God&#x27;s word and prevent another Tribulation, they must preserve absolute normality among the surviving humans, plants and animals, and therefore practice eugenics. Humans with even minor mutations are considered blasphemies and either killed or sterilized and banished to the Fringes, a lawless and untamed area rife with animal and plant mutations, and suggested to be contaminated with radiation. Arguments occur over the keeping of a tailless cat or the possession of over-sized horses. These are deemed by the government to be legitimate breeds, either existing before or achieved through conventional breeding. The government&#x27;s position is considered both cynical and heretical by many of the orthodox frontier community, and it is suggested that they support the usage of these animals for the sole purpose of their greater efficiency.

The inland rural settlement of Waknuk is a frontier farming community, populated with hardy and pious individuals, and is where the story mainly takes place. David Strorm, the son of Waknuk&#x27;s most religious man, Joseph Strorm, has dreams of large cities and &quot;horseless carts&quot;, although he does not understand why he has these dreams or what they mean, and is cautious about mentioning it to his father, lest he raise suspicion that he&#x27;s a mutant. He makes friends with Sophie, a girl who secretly has six toes on one of her feet. Later, Sophie&#x27;s family attempts to escape from the reprisals (ceremonies in which blasphemies are sterilized) when her wet footprints are seen and reported by a local boy.

David and a few other children in Waknuk hide their own form of mutation, telepathy. David&#x27;s Uncle Axel, who learned about the group from talking to David about his telepathy when he was young, advises David and protects them from persecution. He commends David on the wisdom of hiding his and the others&#x27; ability, and later kills the husband of one of the group&#x27;s members who was planning to blackmail the telepaths. David&#x27;s younger sister Petra demonstrates exceptionally strong telepathic talent when her horse is attacked by a wildcatshe calls to all the telepaths for help across the entire Waknuk area, and stuns those closest to her. That leads to suspicion from the locals, and Uncle Axel warns the group, via David, that the Inspectors are beginning to investigate them.

Later, two telepaths, Katherine and Sally, are captured and tortured for information, while David, his cousin Rosalind and Petra escape to the Fringes. A group of men from various districts band together to track and capture the telepathsunknown to the Norms, the posse includes a telepath named Michael who keeps the escaping group informed of the trackers&#x27; progress. Later, with Petra&#x27;s strong telepathic abilities, they contact a society with telepaths in a different country they mistakenly refer to as &quot;Sealand&quot; (actually New Zealand). With the help of Sophie, who is now living in the Fringes, they escape the hunters and are rescued by a Sealand expedition. Unfortunately, they do not have enough fuel to take the craft back to Waknuk to pick up Rachel, the lone remaining Waknuk telepath, so they continue to Sealand. Michael vows to return to Waknuk to rescue Rachel, and join them in Sealand however they can.

==Tribulation==
Though the nature of &quot;Tribulation&quot; is not explicitly stated, it is implied that it was a nuclear holocaust, both by the mutations and by the stories of sailors who report blackened, glassy wastes to the south-west where the ruins of faintly glowing cities can be seen (presumably the east coast of the US). Sailors venturing too close to these places experience symptoms consistent with radiation sickness. A woman from Sealand, a character with evident knowledge of the Old People&#x27;s technology, mentions &quot;the power of gods in the hands of children&quot;, referring to the nuclear capabilities of world powers led by incompetent political leaders.

==Major characters==
* David Strorm is the narrator of the story. David is one of a small group of youngsters who can communicate with each other via telepathy. However, their community&#x27;s theological prejudice against anyone who is abnormal means he and the others must keep their abilities carefully hidden. David and Rosalind&#x27;s love for each other is kept secret from their parents because of a bitter feud between their families.
* Sophie Wender is a young girl born with six toes on one of her feet. Sophie lives with her parents in an isolated cottage somewhere north-west of Waknuk. Her deviation from the &quot;norm&quot; keeps her from associating with other children. She befriends David after he discovers her secret but promises not to reveal it.
* Joseph Strorm is the father of David and Petra. He is a domineering personality, deeply religious, and unyielding on the subject of mutations and blasphemy, even punishing David severely for an unintentionally blasphemous remark about &quot;needing an extra hand&quot; to apply a bandage.
* Uncle Axel is a widely travelled former sailor, open minded and willing to question conventional religious precepts. Upon discovering David&#x27;s telepathy, he counsels caution and extracts a promise that David take great care not to allow others to learn of his mutation.
* Petra Strorm is the youngest of the Strorm children. The group of telepaths discovers that her ability is extraordinarily strong and difficult to resist, placing the group at greater risk of discovery.
* Rosalind Morton is David&#x27;s closest friend among the group of telepaths. They become more of a couple later on in the book. She lives on a neighbouring farm and is David&#x27;s half cousin.
* The Sealand woman and her people are from a technologically advanced society where telepathic ability, while not ubiquitous, is far more common and is accepted, promoted and studied. The woman calls her country &quot;Zealand&quot;, but the telepaths (having had only second-hand contact through Petra) initially believe it is &quot;Sealand&quot; instead.
* Michael is the most objective, perceptive and decisive of the telepaths, the best educated, and in many ways plays a leading role in the group despite his physical absence from events in the story. His telepathic abilities remain secret, and during the pursuit into the Fringes he joins the leading posse to give updates and warnings to David, Rosalind and Petra as they flee.
* Rachel is the last remaining telepath in Waknuk after David, Rosalind and Petra depart to Zealand. As her own elder sister who was also a telepath had committed suicide earlier in the book, her possible fate of being left alone whilst the others depart carries even greater pathos. As an act of heroism, commitment and love, Michael remains behind with Rachel when they find out that the aircraft bringing the four of the telepaths to Zealand does not have enough fuel to also collect Rachel from Waknuk and get home again. He declares his intention to find some other way to come to Zealand with Rachel at some future time.

==Allusions to actual geography==

The inland village of Waknuk (Wabush) is in southwestern Labrador. Labrador has become a much warmer place in the fictional future, with large tracts of arable land. Rigo (Rigolet) is the capital of Labrador and the fictional government in the book, a fairly large river town near the east coast. The port of Lark (Lark Harbour) is mentioned as a way-point on the west coast of the island of Newf (Newfoundland) where sailors may obtain provisions.

A large island to the north-east (Greenland) is rumoured to be inhabited by an amazonian people with bizarre habits. Northern islands are described as being cold and inhabited chiefly by birds and sea animals (islands of Nunavut). Uncle Axel, a former sailor, has travelled far to the south of Labrador, and from a distance seen the &quot;Black Coasts&quot;, where there are areas with what look like ruins of the old civilisation. He also recounts second-hand tales of South American primates living in forests.

Later, the existence of geographic areas far less affected by the nuclear exchange and fallout are established, particularly Sealand (New Zealand), which is home to a socially and technologically advanced society where telepathy not only is the norm, but is encouraged and developed as a survival advantage.

==Literary significance==

Although stylistically &quot;The Chrysalids&quot; does not differ markedly from Wyndham&#x27;s other novels, the subject matter is rather different. While most are set against a mid-twentieth-century English middle-class background, &quot;The Chrysalids&quot; is set in a future society which is described in some detail. Unlike most of his novels, it is also a coming-of-age story.

It was written after &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot; and before &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot;.

==Critical response==
J. Francis McComas, reviewing the American release for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, declared that the &quot;outstanding success&quot; of the novel lay in Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;creation of humanly understandable characters that are, after all, something more and less than human&quot; and concluded that the novel &quot;will be well noted and long remembered&quot;.

The critic and science fiction author Damon Knight wrote that Wyndham &quot;failed to realize how good a thing he had. The sixth toe was immensely believable, and sufficient; but Wyndham has dragged in a telepathic mutation on top of it; has made David himself one of the nine child telepaths, and hauled the whole plot away from his carefully built background, into just one more damned chase with a rousing cliche at the end of it ... this error is fatal.&quot;

SFreviews.net gave a mixed review, stating that &quot;&quot;The Chrysalids&quot; comes heart-wrenchingly close to being John Wyndham&#x27;s most powerful and profound work&quot;, but that &quot;Wyndham stumbles—catastrophically—at the climax, in a way that actually undermines the story&#x27;s thematic foundations&quot;.

The novel also got some positive reviews. The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; judged the novel as &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;a top-notch piece of sci-fi that should be enjoyed for generations yet to come&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it as &quot;a remarkably tender story of a post-nuclear childhood&quot; and &quot;a classic to most of its three generations of readers&quot;. &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; reviewer George W. Earley praised it as &quot;a compelling story and Mr. Wyndham&#x27;s best novel to date.&quot;

&quot;Galaxy&quot; reviewer Groff Conklin praised the novel as &quot;so skillfully done that the fact that it&#x27;s not a shiny new idea makes absolutely no difference&quot;. Anthony Boucher similarly found the novel made &quot;something completely fresh&quot; out of a familiar theme, commending Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;accumulation of minutely plausible detail&quot; and &quot;greater depth and maturity than he has shown in previous novels&quot;. Writing in &quot;Astounding&quot;, P. Schuyler Miller reported that Wyndham &quot;has made the Mutant theme believable in a way that &quot;Odd John&quot;, &quot;Slan&quot; and the stories of the Baldies never quite were&quot;.

There is critical disagreement regarding whether the intervention of the Sealand culture at the end of the novel should be considered a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;.

Critics have disagreed with Wyndham&#x27;s implication that two differently evolved species must necessarily fight to the death. Wyndham justifies this in a lengthy speech from the Sealand woman near the end of the novel, but her reasoning seems at odds with the implicit plea for tolerance in the earlier part of the novel. This implication also exists in &quot;The Kraken Wakes&quot; and &quot;The Midwich Cuckoos&quot;.

==Radio adaptations==
BBC Radio 4 &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; presented an unabridged reading by Geoffrey Wheeler of the novel in ten 15-minute episodes, broadcast daily between 17 and 28 August 1970.

The novel was adapted by Barbara Clegg as a single 90-minute drama for BBC Radio 4, directed by Michael Bartlett, and first broadcast on 24 April 1981. The cast includes:
* Stephen Garlick – David
* Amanda Murray – Rosalind
* Judy Bennett – Petra
* Spencer Banks – Michael/Alan
* Philipa Ritchie – Katherine
* Jenny Lee – Rachel
* Kathryn Hurlbutt – Anne
This version was released on CD by BBC Audiobooks in 2007.

One example lifted almost verbatim from the text reflects a philosophical explanation by the New Zealand woman: &quot;But life is change, that is how it differs from rocks, change is its very nature.&quot; This line is rendered in the lyrics as &quot;Life is change – How it differs from the rocks.&quot; The portion of the song that reads: &quot;In loyalty to their kind / they cannot tolerate our minds. / In loyalty to our kind / we cannot tolerate their obstruction&quot; is from an explanation by the New Zealand woman that asserts the inevitability of conflict between a more advanced species and its less advanced progenitors. (The book&#x27;s original phrase is &quot;they cannot tolerate our &quot;rise&quot;&quot;.)

<doc id="267139" wikidata="Q214519" url="?curid=267139" title="Track gauge">
<text>In rail transport, track gauge is the distance between the two rails of a railway track. All vehicles on a rail network must have wheelsets that are compatible with the track gauge. Since many different track gauges exist worldwide, gauge differences often present a barrier to wider operation on railway networks.

The term derives from the metal bar, or gauge, that is used to ensure the distance between the rails is correct.

Railways also deploy two other gauges to ensure compliance with a required standard. A &quot;loading gauge&quot; is a two-dimensional profile that encompasses a cross-section of the track, a rail vehicle and a maximum-sized load: all rail vehicles and their loads must be contained in the corresponding envelope. A &quot;structure gauge&quot; specifies the outline into which structures (bridges, platforms, lineside equipment etc.) must not encroach.

==Uses of the term==
The most common use of the term &quot;track gauge&quot; refers to the transverse distance between the inside surfaces of the two load-bearing rails of a railway track, usually measured at to below the top of the rail head in order to clear worn corners and allow for rail heads having sloping sides. The term derives from the &quot;gauge&quot;, a metal bar with a precisely positioned lug at each end that track crews use to ensure the actual distance between the rails lies within tolerances of a prescribed standard: on curves, for example, the spacing is wider than normal. Deriving from the name of the bar, the distance between these rails is also referred to as the track gauge.

==Choice of gauge==

===Early track gauges===
The earliest form of railway was a wooden wagonway, along which single wagons were manhandled, almost always in or from a mine or quarry. Initially the wagons were guided by human muscle power; subsequently by various mechanical methods. Timber rails wore rapidly: later, flat cast-iron plates were provided to limit the wear. In some localities, the plates were made L-shaped, with the vertical part of the L guiding the wheels; this is generally referred to as a &quot;plateway&quot;. Flanged wheels eventually became universal, and the spacing between the rails had to be compatible with that of the wagon wheels.

As the guidance of the wagons was improved, short strings of wagons could be connected and pulled by teams of horses, and the track could be extended from the immediate vicinity of the mine or quarry, typically to a navigable waterway. The wagons were built to a consistent pattern and the track would be made to suit the needs of the horses and wagons: the gauge was more critical. The Penydarren Tramroad of 1802 in South Wales, a plateway, spaced these at over the outside of the upstands.
The Penydarren Tramroad probably carried the first journey by a locomotive, in 1804, and it was successful for the locomotive, but unsuccessful for the track: the plates were not strong enough to carry its weight. A considerable progressive step was made when cast iron edge rails were first employed; these had the major axis of the rail section configured vertically, giving a much stronger section to resist bending forces, and this was further improved when fish-belly rails were introduced.

Edge rails required a close match between rail spacing and the configuration of the wheelsets, and the importance of the gauge was reinforced. Railways were still seen as local concerns: there was no appreciation of a future connection to other lines, and the choice of track gauge was still a pragmatic decision based on local requirements and prejudices, and probably determined by existing local designs of (road) vehicles.

Thus, the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway (1826) in the West of Scotland used ; the Dundee and Newtyle Railway (1831) in the north-east of Scotland adopted ; the Redruth and Chasewater Railway (1825) in Cornwall chose .

The Arbroath and Forfar Railway opened in 1838 with a gauge of , and the Ulster Railway of 1839 used .

===&quot;Standard&quot; gauge appears===
Locomotives were being developed in the first decades of the 19th century; they took various forms, but George Stephenson developed a successful locomotive on the Killingworth Wagonway, where he worked. His designs were successful, and when the Stockton and Darlington Railway was opened in 1825, it used his locomotives, with the same gauge as the Killingworth line, .

The Stockton and Darlington line was very successful, and when the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first intercity line, was opened in 1830, it used the same gauge. It too was very successful, and the gauge, widened to and named &quot;standard gauge&quot;, was well on its way to becoming the established norm.

===Gauge differences===
The Liverpool and Manchester was quickly followed by other trunk railways, with the Grand Junction Railway and the London and Birmingham Railway forming a huge preponderance of standard gauge. When Bristol promoters planned a line from London, they employed the innovative engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He decided on a wider gauge, to give greater stability, and the Great Western Railway adopted a gauge of , later eased to . This became known as &quot;broad gauge&quot;. The Great Western Railway (GWR) was successful and was greatly expanded, directly and through friendly associated companies, widening the scope of broad gauge.

At the same time, other parts of Britain built railways to standard gauge, and British technology was exported to European countries and parts of North America, also using standard gauge. Britain polarised into two areas: those that used broad gauge and those that used standard gauge. In this context, standard gauge was referred to as &quot;narrow gauge&quot; to indicate the contrast. Some smaller concerns selected other non-standard gauges: the Eastern Counties Railway adopted . Most of them converted to standard gauge at an early date, but the GWR&#x27;s broad gauge continued to grow.

The larger railway companies wished to expand geographically, and large areas were considered to be under their control. When a new independent line was proposed to open up an unconnected area, the gauge was crucial in determining the allegiance that the line would adopt: if it was broad gauge, it must be friendly to the Great Western railway; if narrow (standard) gauge, it must favour the other companies. The battle to persuade or coerce that choice became very intense, and became referred to as &quot;the gauge wars&quot;.

As passenger and freight transport between the two areas became increasingly important, the difficulty of moving from one gauge to the other—the &quot;break of gauge&quot;—became more prominent and more objectionable. In 1845 a Royal Commission on Railway Gauges was created to look into the growing problem, and this led to the Regulating the Gauge of Railways Act 1846, which forbade the construction of broad gauge lines unconnected with the broad gauge network. The broad gauge network was eventually converted—a progressive process completed in 1892, called gauge conversion. The same Act mandated the gauge of for use in Ireland.

===Gauge selection in other countries===

 As railways were built in other countries, the gauge selection was pragmatic: the track would have to fit the rolling stock. If locomotives were imported from elsewhere, especially in the early days, the track would be built to fit them. In some cases standard gauge was adopted, but many countries or companies chose a different gauge as their national gauge, either by governmental policy, or as a matter of individual choice.

==Terminology==
&quot;Standard gauge&quot; is generally known world-wide as being . Terms such as &quot;broad gauge&quot; and &quot;narrow gauge&quot; do not have any fixed meaning beyond being materially wider or narrower than standard.

In British practice, the space between the rails of a track is colloquially referred to as the &quot;four-foot&quot;, and the space between two tracks the &quot;six-foot&quot;, descriptions relating to the respective dimensions.

=== Standard gauge ===

In modern usage the term &quot;standard gauge&quot; refers to . Standard gauge is dominant in a majority of countries, including those in North America, most of western Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and China.

===Broad gauge===

In modern usage, the term &quot;broad gauge&quot; generally refers to track spaced significantly wider than .

Broad gauge is the dominant gauge in countries in Indian subcontinent, the former Soviet Union (CIS states, Baltic states, Georgia and Ukraine), Mongolia, Finland (which still uses the original Soviet Gauge of 1524mm), Spain, Portugal, Argentina, Chile and Ireland. It is also used for the suburban railway systems in South Australia, and Victoria, Australia.

=== Medium gauge ===
The term &quot;medium gauge&quot; had different meanings throughout history, depending on the local dominant gauge in use.

In 1840s, the Irish gauge was considered a medium gauge compared to Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge and the narrow gauge, which became the modern standard gauge.

===Narrow gauge===
In modern usage, the term &quot;narrow gauge&quot; generally refers to track spaced significantly narrower than .

Narrow gauge is the dominant or second dominant gauge in countries of Southern, Central Africa, East Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, Central America and South America,

During the period known as &quot;the Battle of the gauges&quot;, Stephenson&#x27;s standard gauge was commonly known as &quot;narrow gauge&quot;, while Brunel&#x27;s railway&#x27;s gauge was termed &quot;broad gauge&quot;. Many narrow gauge railways were built in mountainous regions such as Wales, the Rocky Mountains of North America, Central Europe and South America. Industrial railways and mine railways across the world are often narrow gauge. Sugar cane and banana plantations are mostly served by narrow gauges.

===Minimum gauge===
Very narrow gauges of under were used for some industrial railways in space-restricted environments such as mines or farms. The French company Decauville developed and tracks, mainly for mines; Heywood developed gauge for estate railways. The most common minimum gauges were , , , , or .

===Break of gauge===

Through operation between railway networks with different gauges was originally impossible; goods had to be transshipped and passengers had to change trains. This was obviously a major obstacle to convenient transport, and in Great Britain, led to political intervention.

On narrow gauge lines, rollbocks or transporter wagons are used: standard gauge wagons are carried on narrow gauge lines on these special vehicles, generally with rails of the wider gauge to enable those vehicles to roll on and off at transfer points.

On the Transmongolian Railway, Russia and Mongolia use while China uses the standard gauge of 1,435 mm. At the border, each carriage is lifted and its bogies are changed. The operation can take several hours for a whole train of many carriages.

Other examples include crossings into or out of the former Soviet Union: Ukraine/Slovakia border on the Bratislava–Lviv train, and the Romania/Moldova border on the Chișinău–Bucharest train.

A system developed by Talgo and Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) of Spain uses variable gauge wheelsets; at the border between France and Spain, through passenger trains are drawn slowly through an apparatus that alters the gauge of the wheels, which slide laterally on the axles.

A similar system is used between China and Central Asia, and between Poland and Ukraine, using the SUW 2000 and INTERGAUGE variable axle systems. China and Poland use standard gauge, while Central Asia and Ukraine use .

==Dual gauge==

When individual railway companies have chosen different gauges and have needed to share a route where space on the ground is limited, mixed gauge (or dual gauge) track, in which three (sometimes four) rails are supported in the same track structure, can be necessary. The most frequent need for such track was at the approaches to city terminals or at break-of-gauge stations.

Tracks of multiple gauges involve considerable costs in construction (including signalling work) and complexities in track maintenance, and may require some speed restrictions. They are therefore built only when absolutely necessary. If the difference between the two gauges is large enough – for example between and – three-rail dual-gauge is possible, but if not – for example between and – four rails must be used. Dual-gauge rail lines occur (or have occurred) in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Japan, North Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia and Vietnam.
On the GWR, there was an extended period between political intervention in 1846 that prevented major expansion of its broad gauge and the final gauge conversion to standard gauge in 1892. During this period, many locations practicality required mixed gauge operation, and in station areas the track configuration was extremely complex. This was compounded by the common rail having to be at the platform side in stations; therefore, in many cases, standard-gauge trains needed to be switched from one side of the track to the other at the approach. A special fixed point arrangement was devised for the purpose, where the track layout was simple enough.

In some cases, mixed gauge trains were operated with wagons of both gauges. For example, MacDermot wrote:

In November 1871 a novelty in the shape of a &quot;mixed-gauge&quot; goods train was introduced between Truro and Penzance. It was worked by a narrow-gauge engine, and behind the narrow-gauge trucks came a broad-gauge match-truck with wide buffers and sliding shackles, followed by the broad-gauge trucks. Such trains continued to run in West Cornwall until the abolition of the Broad Gauge; they had to stop or come down to walking pace at all stations where fixed points existed and the narrow portion side-stepped to right or left.

==Triple gauge==

In rare situations, three different gauges may converge on to a rail yard and triple-gauge track is needed to meet the operational needs of the break-of-gauge station – most commonly where there is insufficient space to do otherwise. Construction and operation of triple-gauge track and its signalling, however, involves immense cost and disruption, and is undertaken when no other alternative is available.

==Nominal track gauge==
The nominal track gauge is the distance between the inner faces of the rails. In current practice, it is specified at a certain distance below the rail head as the inner faces of the rail head (the &quot;gauge faces&quot;) are not necessarily vertical. Some amount of tolerance is necessarily allowed from the nominal gauge to allow for wear, etc.; this tolerance is typically greater for track limited to slower speeds, and tighter for track where higher speeds are expected (as an example, in the US the gauge is allowed to vary between to for track limited to , while track is allowed only to . Given the allowed tolerance, it is a common practice to widen the gauge slightly in curves, particularly those of shorter radius (which are inherently slower speed curves).

Rolling stock on the network must have running gear (wheelsets) that are compatible with the gauge, and therefore the gauge is a key parameter in determining interoperability, but there are many others – see below. In some cases in the earliest days of railways, the railway company saw itself as an infrastructure provider only, and independent hauliers provided wagons suited to the gauge. Colloquially the wagons might be referred to as &quot;four-foot gauge wagons&quot;, say, if the track had a gauge of four feet. This nominal value does not equate to the flange spacing, as some freedom is allowed for.

An infrastructure manager might specify new or replacement track components at a slight variation from the nominal gauge for pragmatic reasons.

==Units==
The gauge is defined in imperial units, metric units or SI units.

Imperial units were established in the United Kingdom by the Weights and Measures Act 1824. The United States customary units for length did not agree with the imperial system until 1959, when one international yard was defined as 0.9144 meters and, as derived units, 1 foot (= yd) as 0.3048 meter and 1 inch (= yd) as 25.4 mm.

The list shows the imperial and other units that have been used for track gauge definitions:
==Temporary way – permanent way==
A temporary way is the temporary track often used for construction, to be replaced by the permanent way (the structure consisting of the rails, fasteners, sleepers/ties and ballast (or slab track), plus the underlying subgrade) when construction nears completion. In many cases narrow-gauge track is used for a temporary way because of the convenience in laying it and changing its location over unimproved ground.

In restricted spaces such as tunnels, the temporary way might be double track even though the tunnel will ultimately be single track. The Airport Rail Link in Sydney had construction trains of gauge, which were replaced by permanent tracks of gauge.

During World War I, trench warfare led to a relatively static disposition of infantry, requiring considerable logistics to bring them support staff and supplies (food, ammunition, earthworks materials, etc.). Dense light railway networks using temporary narrow gauge track sections were established by both sides for this purpose.

In 1939 it was proposed to construct the western section of the Yunnan–Burma Railway using a gauge of , since such tiny or &quot;toy&quot; gauge facilitates the tightest of curves in difficult terrain.

==Maintenance standards==

Infrastructure owners specify permitted variances from the nominal gauge, and the required interventions when non-compliant gauge is detected. For example, the Federal Railroad Administration in the US specifies that the actual gauge of a 1,435 mm track that is rated for a maximum of must be between and .

==Advantages and disadvantages of different track gauges==
Speed, capacity, and economy are generally objectives of rail transport, but there is often an inverse relationship between these priorities. There is a common misconception that a narrower gauge permits a tighter turning radius, but for practical purposes, there is no meaningful relationship between gauge and curvature.

===Construction cost===
Narrower gauge railways usually cost less to build because they are usually lighter in construction, using smaller cars and locomotives (smaller loading gauge), as well as smaller bridges, smaller tunnels (smaller structure gauge). Narrow gauge is thus often used in mountainous terrain, where the savings in civil engineering work can be substantial. It is also used in sparsely populated areas, with low potential demand, and for temporary railways that will be removed after short-term use, such as for construction, the logging industry, the mining industry, or large-scale construction projects, especially in confined spaces (see Temporary way – permanent way).

For temporary railways which will be removed after short-term use, such as those used in logging, mining or large-scale construction projects, especially in confined spaces, such as when constructing the Channel Tunnel, a narrow-gauge railway is substantially cheaper and easier to install and remove. Such railways have almost vanished due to the capabilities of modern trucks. In many countries, narrow-gauge railways were built as branch lines to feed traffic to standard-gauge lines due to lower construction costs. The choice was often not between a narrow- and standard-gauge railway, but between a narrow-gauge railway and none at all.

Broader gauge railways are generally more expensive to build, because they are usually heavier in construction, use larger cars and locomotives (larger loading gauge), as well as larger bridges, larger tunnels (larger structure gauge). But broader gauges offer higher speed and capacity. For routes with high traffic, greater capacity may more than offset the higher initial cost of construction.

===Interchangeability===
The value or utility a user derives from a good or service depends on the number of users of compatible products – the &quot;network effect&quot; in economics. Network effects are typically positive, resulting in a given user deriving more value from a product as other users join the same network. At national levels, the network effect has resulted in commerce extending beyond regional and national boundaries. Increasingly, many governments and companies have made their railways&#x27; engineering and operational standards compatible in order to achieve interchangeability – hence faster, longer-distance train operation. A major barrier to achieving interchangeability, however, is path dependence – in this context the persistence of an already adopted standard to which equipment, infrastructure and training has become aligned.

Since adopting a new standard is difficult and expensive, continuing with an existing standard can remain attractive, unless longer-term benefits are given appropriate weight. An example of the consequences of path dependence is the persistence in the United Kingdom – the earliest nation to develop and adopt railway technologies – of structure gauges that are too small to allow the larger rolling stock of continental Europe to operate in the UK. The reduced cost, greater efficiency, and greater economic opportunity offered by the use of a common standard has resulted in the historical multitude of track gauges dwindling to a small number that predominate worldwide.

When interchangeability has not been achieved, freight and passengers must be transferred through time-consuming procedures requiring manual labour and substantial capital expenditure. Some bulk commodities, such as coal, ore, and gravel, can be mechanically transshipped, but even this is time-consuming, and the equipment required for the transfer is often complex to maintain. If rail lines of different gauges coexist in a network and a break of gauge exists, it is difficult in times of peak demand to move rolling stock to where it is needed.

Sufficient rolling stock must be available to meet a narrow-gauge railway&#x27;s peak demand, which might be greater in comparison to a broader-gauge network, and the surplus equipment generates no cash flow during periods of low demand. In regions where narrow-gauge lines form a small part of the rail network (as was the case on Russia&#x27;s Sakhalin Railway), extra cost is involved in designing, manufacturing or importing narrow-gauge equipment.

Solutions to interchangeability problems include bogie exchanges, a rollbock system, dual gauge, variable gauge, or gauge conversion.

== Dominant railway gauges ==

More than half of the world&#x27;s railways are built to . New railways have been built in Africa to standard gauge. Most of the narrow-gauge railways in India are being converted to the dominant, broad-gauge.

=== Prevalence ===
Total for each group of gauges in 2020:
==Future==
Further convergence of rail gauge use seems likely, as countries seek to build inter-operable networks, and international organisations seek to build macro-regional and continental networks. Almost all new high-speed rail lines are built to standard gauge, except in Uzbekistan and Russia.

===Europe===
The European Union has set out to develop inter-operable freight and passenger rail networks across its area, and is seeking to standardise gauge, signalling and electrical power systems. EU funds have been dedicated to assist Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia in the building of some key railway lines (Rail Baltica) of standard gauge, and to assist Spain and Portugal in the construction of high-speed lines to connect Iberian cities to one another and to the French high-speed lines. The EU has developed plans for improved freight rail links between Spain, Portugal, and the rest of Europe.

===Trans-Asian Railway===

The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) is planning a Trans-Asian Railway that will link Europe and the Pacific, with a Northern Corridor from Europe to the Korean Peninsula, a Southern Corridor from Europe to Southeast Asia, and a North–South corridor from Northern Europe to the Persian Gulf. All these would encounter breaks of gauge as they cross Asia. Current plans have mechanized facilities at the breaks of gauge to move containers from train to train rather than widespread gauge conversion. The Northern Corridor through Russia already operates since before year 2000, with increasing volumes China–Europe.

===The Americas===

* 2008: Proposed link between Venezuela and Colombia
* 2008: Venezuela via Brazil to Argentina – standard gauge
* 2008: A proposed metre gauge line across Southern Paraguay to link Argentina at Resistencia to Brazil at Cascavel; both those lines are , and the new line would allow &quot;bioceanic&quot; running from the Atlantic port of Paranaguá in Brazil to that of Antofagasta in Chile on the Pacific.

===Africa===

The East African Railway Master Plan is a proposal for rebuilding and expanding railway lines connecting Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, South Sudan and beyond. The plan is managed by infrastructure ministers from participating East African Community countries in association with transport consultation firm CPCS Transcom. Older railways are of or gauge. Newly rebuilt lines will use standard gauge. Regular freight and passenger services began on the standard gauge Mombasa–Nairobi railway in 2017 and on the standard gauge Addis Ababa–Djibouti railway in 2018.

Lines for iron ore to Kribi in Cameroon are likely to be with a likely connection to the same port from the Cameroon system.

Nigeria&#x27;s railways are mostly Cape gauge. The Lagos–Kano Standard Gauge Railway is a gauge conversion project by the Nigerian Government to create a north–south standard gauge rail link. The first converted segment, between Abuja and Kaduna, was completed in July 2016.

The African Union has a 50-year plan to connect the capital cities and major centres by high-speed railways.

<text>Cave Johnson (January 11, 1793 – November 23, 1866) was an American politician who served the state of Tennessee as a Democratic congressman in the United States House of Representatives. Johnson was the 12th United States Postmaster General in the administration of James K. Polk from 1845 to 1849.

==Early life==
Johnson was born near present-day Springfield, Tennessee to Robert and Mary Noel Johnson. He was named for Rev. Richard Cave, a Baptist minister in the Travelling Church with whom Mary&#x27;s mother, also named Mary Noel, had been acquainted in Kentucky. He suspected but could never prove a relation to William Cave Johnson of Boone County, Kentucky. He was studying at Cumberland College when the War of 1812 began, and organized a band of volunteers that Andrew Jackson declined. In 1813 he joined his father&#x27;s militia unit in the Creek War, returning to Nashville the next year to complete law studies in the firm of Parry Wayne Humphreys.

==Career==
Johnson settled in Clarksville and served on its first board of aldermen. At the time of his first election to Congress in 1829, he owned an iron factory that employed both free and enslaved black workers. He advocated legal protection of slavery under the federal constitution, believing that this would prevent &quot;moderate&quot; southerners from being overwhelmed by secessionist Fire-Eaters.

Samuel Morse&#x27;s proposal for the Baltimore–Washington telegraph line came before Congress for funding during Johnson&#x27;s tenure. Johnson mocked the idea by introducing a rider to fund research into animal magnetism. After the line was successfully demonstrated he apologized to Morse, calling the telegraph an &quot;astonishing invention&quot;.

Johnson acted as a campaign manager for presidential candidate James K. Polk at both the Democratic party convention and for the general election. After his victory Polk appointed him Postmaster General, which he held during the full term. He shifted the department from a collect on delivery system to a prepaid system by introducing the adhesive postage stamp in 1847. Johnson&#x27;s duties included overseeing operation of the Baltimore–Washington line, which he struggled to make profitable as other private telegraph lines were constructed. He urged that telegraph lines not be left in unregulated private hands, concerned that they would ruin the Post Office while enriching those who held preferential information access, but his fellow Democrats were unreceptive.

He later served as a state circuit court judge and as president of the Third Bank of Tennessee from 1854 to 1860. During the secession crisis he joined the short-lived Union Party that sought to keep Tennessee loyal to the federal government. He joined in drafting an address that urged the state to remain in the Union while refusing to participate in coercive measures against the Confederacy. Failing in this effort, he sided with the Confederacy but took no personal part in the war. After the Battle of Fort Donelson brought Clarksville under Union control, Johnson was one of three spokesmen who greeted the administering Union officer. He was elected to the state Senate in 1866, but allies of Republican Governor William G. Brownlow refused to seat him.

==Personal life==
Johnson proposed to Elizabeth Dortch in 1815. She rejected him for another suitor, embarrassing him so deeply that he dared not pursue a woman again for more than twenty years. His next proposal in 1838 was to the same Elizabeth Dortch, by then widowed. She accepted and they had three sons. Johnson was the maternal uncle of Lt. Col. Cave Johnson Couts of California

<text>Marriage Equality USA was an organization working for the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in the United States. The group worked by doing public education and outreach, media campaigns and holding visibility events. Marriage Equality, Inc. was founded in 1998.

==Engaged Tour==
In the months after the passing of Proposition 8, Marriage Equality USA sponsored a statewide poll to determine opinions on same sex marriage. Polling data was presented in over forty cities in a town hall forum dubbed the &quot;Get Engaged Tour&quot;. At the events participants were presented the results of the statewide polling data, as well as an opportunity to discuss next steps in moving forward with an effort to bring about marriage equality.

<doc id="267165" wikidata="Q380038" url="?curid=267165" title="Harvey Cushing">
<text>Harvey Williams Cushing (April 8, 1869 – October 7, 1939) was an American neurosurgeon, pathologist, writer, and draftsman. A pioneer of brain surgery, he was the first exclusive neurosurgeon and the first person to describe Cushing&#x27;s disease. He wrote a biography of physician William Osler in three volumes.

==Early life and education==
Cushing was born in Cleveland, Ohio. His parents were Elizabeth Maria &quot;Betsey M.&quot; Williams (sister of Edward and Charles Williams) and Henry Kirke Cushing, a physician whose ancestors came to Hingham, Massachusetts, as Puritans in the 17th century. Harvey, the fourth generation of a line of physicians founded by his great-grandfather Dr. David Cushing (1768–1814), was the youngest of ten children.

As a child, Cushing attended the Cleveland Manual Training School, which expanded his interest in science and medicine. The school&#x27;s emphasis on experimental training and a &quot;physics-focused&quot; approach to education played an important role in influencing Cushing toward a career in medical surgery. The school&#x27;s manual dexterity training program also contributed to Cushing&#x27;s future success as a surgeon.

He graduated with an B.A. degree in 1891 from Yale University, where he was a member of Scroll and Key and Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter). He studied medicine at Harvard Medical School and earned his medical degree in 1895. Cushing completed his internship at Massachusetts General Hospital and then did a residency in surgery under the guidance of pioneering surgeon William Stewart Halsted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.

He subsequently trained in neurological surgery abroad under Emil Theodor Kocher at Bern and Charles Scott Sherrington at Liverpool.

==Career==
Cushing began his career in private practice in Baltimore. During his time with Kocher, he first encountered the Cushing reflex, which describes the relationship between blood pressure and intracranial pressure. At the age of 32, he was made associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital and was placed in full charge of cases of surgery of the central nervous system. He wrote numerous monographs on surgery of the brain and spinal column and made important contributions in bacteriology. He conducted (with Kocher) a study of intracerebral pressure and (with Sherrington) contributed much to the localization of the cerebral centers. 

In Baltimore, he developed the method of operating with local anesthesia, and his paper on its use in hernia gave him a European reputation. In 1911, he was appointed surgeon-in-chief at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He became a professor of surgery at the Harvard Medical School starting in 1912. In 1913, he was made an honorary F.R.C.S. (London). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914. In 1915, before the Clinical Congress of Surgeons in Boston, he showed the possibility of influencing stature by operating on the pituitary gland. In 1924, Cushing was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

===World War I===
Shortly after the entry of the United States into the World War I, Cushing was commissioned as a major in the U.S. Army Medical Corps on May 5, 1917. He was director of the U.S. base hospital attached to the British expeditionary Force in France. Cushing also served as the head of a surgical unit in a French military hospital outside of Paris. During his time at the French military hospital, Cushing experimented with the use of electromagnets to extract metallic shrapnel fragments that were lodged within the brain. He was mentioned in a dispatch by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in November 1917.

On June 6, 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was assigned as senior consultant in neurological surgery for the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe. In early October, while in France, he came down with what he described as &quot;the grippe,&quot; which was probably the Spanish flu. He would never fully recover. He attained the rank of colonel (O-6) on October 23, 1918. In that capacity, he treated Lieutenant Edward Revere Osler, who was fatally wounded during the third battle of Ypres. Lieutenant Osler was the son of Sir William Osler.

Cushing returned to the United States in February 1919 and was discharged on April 9, 1919. In recognition of his service during the war, Cushing was invested as a Companion of the Bath by the British government. In 1923, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the U.S. Army.

===Later career===
Cushing authored the Pulitzer prize-winning biography, &quot;Life of Sir William Osler&quot; (London: Oxford University Press, 1925).

From 1933 to 1937, when he retired, he worked at the Yale School of Medicine as Sterling Professor of Neurology.

== Personal life ==
Cushing married his Cleveland childhood friend Katharine Stone Crowell (1870–1949), granddaughter of Ohio congressman John Crowell, on June 10, 1902. They had five children, including three daughters famed for their beauty and collectively known as the &#x27;Cushing sisters&#x27;:

* William Harvey Cushing (1903–1926) (died in an automobile accident while a student at Yale University)
* Mary Benedict &quot;Minnie&quot; Cushing (1906–1978), who married Vincent Astor and later James Whitney Fosburgh;
* Betsey Cushing (1908–1998), who married James Roosevelt and later John Hay Whitney;
* Henry Kirke Cushing (1910–1983), who married Marjorie Estabrook in 1936.
* Barbara &quot;Babe&quot; Cushing (1915–1978), the socialite wife of Stanley Grafton Mortimer and later William S. Paley.
Cushing died on October 7, 1939, in New Haven, Connecticut, from complications of a myocardial infarction. He was interred at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. An autopsy performed on Cushing revealed that his brain harbored a colloid cyst of the third ventricle.

== Legacy ==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Cushing developed many of the basic surgical techniques for operating on the brain. This established him as one of the foremost leaders and experts in the field. Under his influence, neurosurgery became a new and autonomous surgical discipline.

* He considerably improved the survival of patients after difficult brain operations for intracranial tumors.
* He used X-ray to diagnose brain tumors.
* He used electrical stimuli for the study of the human sensory cortex.
* He played a pivotal role in development of the Bovie electrocautery tool with William T. Bovie, a physicist.
* He was the world&#x27;s leading teacher of neurosurgeons in the first decades of the 20th century.

Arguably, Cushing&#x27;s greatest contribution came with his introduction to North America of blood pressure measurement. Upon visiting colleague Scipione Riva-Rocci, an Italian physician, Cushing was astonished by Riva-Rocci&#x27;s non-invasive way of measuring intra-arterial pressure. In 1896, Riva-Rocci developed a wall-mounted mercury manometer linked to a balloon-inflated cuff that would measure the pressure needed to compress arterial systolic pressure, i.e. systolic blood pressure measurement. Riva-Rocci&#x27;s design was based on a more primitive version developed by French physician Pierre Potain. Cushing returned to the US with a sample of Riva-Rocci&#x27;s sphygmomanometer and blood pressure measurement became a vital sign. The use of the Riva-Rocci sphygmomanometer as a diagnostic tool rapidly spread across the US and Western world, a direct contribution by Harvey Cushing. The device&#x27;s use continued until Russian physician Nikolai Korotkov included diastolic blood pressure measurement in 1905 (after he discovered the famed &quot;Korotkoff sounds&quot;) with his improved sphygmomanometer, which also replaced the mercury manometer with a smaller, round dial manometer.
 Cushing&#x27;s name is commonly associated with his most famous discovery, Cushing&#x27;s disease. In 1912 he reported in a study an endocrinological syndrome caused by a malfunction of the pituitary gland which he termed &quot;polyglandular syndrome.&quot; He published his findings in 1932 as &quot;The Basophil Adenomas of the Pituitary Body and Their Clinical Manifestations: pituitary Basophilism&quot;.

Cushing was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1914. In 1917, Cushing was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. Cushing was also awarded the 1926 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography for a book recounting the life of one of the fathers of modern medicine, Sir William Osler. In 1930, Cushing was awarded the Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. As part of the award, he delivered the Lister Memorial Lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in July 1930. That same year, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1930. Cushing was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1934, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He served as president of the History of Science Society in 1934. Cushing was also a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, nominated at least 38 times.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor. Cushing General Hospital (now Cushing Memorial Park) in Framingham, Massachusetts, was named for him.

In 1988, the United States Postal Service issued a 45-cent postage stamp in his honor, as part of the Great Americans series.

Cushing developed many surgical instruments that are in use today, most notably Cushing forceps and the Cushing ventricular cannula. The forceps instrument is used to grasp the thick tissues of the scalp during cranial surgery and the cannula is used to enter the brain ventricles for CSF drainage. He also developed a surgical magnet while working with the Harvard Medical Unit in France during World War I to extract shrapnel from the heads of wounded soldiers.

The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library at Yale University contains extensive collections in the field of medicine and the history of medicine. Cushing&#x27;s long-time personal secretary, Madeline Stanton, played a major role in organizing his rare book donations, along with those from John F. Fulton and Arnold C. Klebs, to form the library. In 2005, the library released portions of its collection online, including the Peter Parker Collection which consists of a collection of portrait engravings and 83 mid-19th-century oil paintings rendered by artist Lam Qua of Chinese tumor patients, and a biography of Harvey Cushing by John F. Fulton. In 2010, Yale placed on display Cushing&#x27;s collection of brain specimens. There is also a collection of his papers at the National Library of Medicine.

<text>The cluster of differentiation (also known as cluster of designation or classification determinant and often abbreviated as CD) is a protocol used for the identification and investigation of cell surface molecules providing targets for immunophenotyping of cells. In terms of physiology, CD molecules can act in numerous ways, often acting as receptors or ligands important to the cell. A signal cascade is usually initiated, altering the behavior of the cell (see cell signaling). Some CD proteins do not play a role in cell signaling, but have other functions, such as cell adhesion. CD for humans is numbered up to 371 ().

== Nomenclature ==
The CD nomenclature was proposed and established in the 1st International Workshop and Conference on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens (HLDA), held in Paris in 1982. This system was intended for the classification of the many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated by different laboratories around the world against epitopes on the surface molecules of leukocytes (white blood cells). Since then, its use has expanded to many other cell types, and more than 370 CD unique clusters and subclusters have been identified. The proposed surface molecule is assigned a CD number once two specific monoclonal antibodies are shown to bind to the molecule. If the molecule has not been well characterized or has only one mAb, it is usually given the provisional indicator &quot;w&quot; (as in &quot;CDw186&quot;).

For instance, CD2 mAbs are reagents that react with a 50‐kDa transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on T cells. The CD designations were used to describe the recognized molecules but had to be clarified by attaching the term antigen or molecule to the designation (e.g., CD2 molecule). Currently, &quot;CD2&quot; is generally used to designate the molecule, and &quot;CD2 antibody&quot; is used to designate the antibody.

Cell populations are usually defined using a &#x27;+&#x27; or a &#x27;−&#x27; symbol to indicate whether a certain cell fraction expresses or lacks a CD molecule. For example, a &quot;CD34+, CD31−&quot; cell is one that expresses CD34 but not CD31. This CD combination typically corresponds to a stem cell, as opposed to a fully differentiated endothelial cell. Some cell populations can also be defined as hi, mid, or low (alternatively, bright, mid, or dim), indicating an overall variability in CD expression, particularly when compared to other cells being studied. A review of the development of T cells in the thymus uses this nomenclature to identify cells transitioning from CD4mid/CD8mid double-positive cells to CD4hi/CD8mid.

==Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen Workshops==
Since 1982 there have been nine Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigen Workshops culminating in a conference.
==Immunophenotyping==

The CD system is commonly used as cell markers in immunophenotyping, allowing cells to be defined based on what molecules are present on their surface. These markers are often used to associate cells with certain immune functions. While using one CD molecule to define populations is uncommon (though a few examples exist), combining markers has allowed for cell types with very specific definitions within the immune system.

CD molecules are utilized in cell sorting using various methods, including flow cytometry.

Two commonly used CD molecules are CD4 and CD8, which are, in general, used as markers for helper and cytotoxic T cells, respectively. These molecules are defined in combination with CD3+, as some other leukocytes also express these CD molecules (some macrophages express low levels of CD4; dendritic cells express high levels of CD8). Human immunodeficiency virus binds CD4 and a chemokine receptor on the surface of a T helper cell to gain entry. The number of CD4 and CD8 T cells in blood is often used to monitor the progression of HIV infection.

==Physiological functions==
While CD molecules are very useful in defining leukocytes, they are not merely markers on the cell surface. Though only a fraction of known CD molecules have been thoroughly characterised, most of them have important functions. In the example of CD4 and CD8, these molecules are critical in antigen recognition. Others (e.g., CD135) act as cell surface receptors for growth factors. Recently, the marker CD47 was found to have anti-phagocytic signals to macrophages and inhibit natural killer (NK) cells. This enabled researchers to apply CD47 as a potential target to attenuate immune rejection.

<doc id="267178" wikidata="Q7690850" url="?curid=267178" title="Te Kooti's War">
<text>Te Kooti&#x27;s War was among the last of the New Zealand Wars, the series of 19th-century conflicts in New Zealand between the Māori and the colonising European settlers. It was fought in the East Coast region and across the heavily forested central North Island and Bay of Plenty from 1868 to 1872, between government military forces and followers of spiritual leader Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki.

The conflict was sparked by Te Kooti&#x27;s return to the East Coast after two years of internment on the Chatham Islands, from where he had escaped with almost 200 Māori prisoners of war and their families. Te Kooti desired to be left in peace but two weeks after their return to the mainland, members of his party found themselves being pursued by a force of militia, government troops and Māori volunteers. Te Kooti&#x27;s force routed them in an ambush, seizing arms, ammunition, food and horses. The engagement was the first in what became a four-year guerrilla war, involving more than 30 expeditions by colonial and Māori troops against Te Kooti&#x27;s dwindling number of warriors. Although initially fighting defensively against pursuing government forces, Te Kooti went on the offensive from November 1868, starting with a raid on Poverty Bay, in which selected European settlers, their families, and Māori opponents were murdered. The attack prompted another pursuit by government forces, one that included the siege at Ngatapa from which Te Kooti escaped but which resulted in the capture and execution of over 100 of his followers.

Te Kooti gained refuge with Tūhoe tribes, which consequently suffered a series of damaging raids in which crops and villages were destroyed, as other Māori &quot;iwi&quot; were lured by the promise of a £5000 reward for Te Kooti&#x27;s capture. Te Kooti was finally granted sanctuary by the Māori king in 1872 and moved to the King Country, where he continued to develop rituals, texts and prayers of his Ringatū faith. He was formally pardoned by the government in February 1883 and died in 1893. 

In modern times, much of the actions that occurred during Te Kooti&#x27;s War, particularly in the early stages of the conflict, have been condemned as an abuse of law and human rights.

==Background==
From 1843 to 1872, there were a series of conflicts in New Zealand between the local Māori people and British imperial and colonial forces, and their Māori allies. These clashes are collectively termed the New Zealand Wars. While some of the wars of this period were as a result of land confiscations or clashes with the Māori King Movement, many of the later conflicts were due to the rise of prophetic Māori leaders and religious movements which threatened the autonomy of the government. These movements also subverted tribalism so often were met with hostility by the leaders of many &quot;iwi&quot; (tribes) as well. Te Kooti&#x27;s War was the last of these later wars, which involved the final field engagements of the New Zealand Wars.

===Te Kooti===
Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki was born probably about 1831 into the Ngāti Maru &quot;hapū&quot; (subtribe) of the Rongowhakaata &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) of the Māori people in Poverty Bay, south of East Cape. He desired to become a preacher but soon fell out with the Whakatō Anglican mission where he had been baptised in 1852. He gained a reputation for lawlessness and philandering in the Makaraka district near Tūranga, present-day Gisborne. His actions offended some of the local &quot;rangatira&quot; (chiefs) and because he also engaged in trading, undercutting local businessmen, became offside with some European settlers. 

In early 1865, a new religion, Pai Mārire, the followers of which being known as Hauhau, was spreading among the Ngāti Maru in the East Cape. Te Kooti stayed clear of the faith and during the East Cape War, fought with &quot;kūpapa&quot; (loyal) Māori and Government troops against the Hauhau in the week-long siege of Waerenga-a-Hika, near Tūranga, in October. Many of the &quot;kūpapa&quot; were fighting reluctantly and Te Kooti&#x27;s brother was among the Hauhau at Waerenga-a-Hika. Te Kooti was accused of being a spy and was arrested after the siege ended. Allegations were made by the Rongowhakaata chief Pāora Parau that Te Kooti had provided gunpowder to the Hauhau. He was released after an investigation, but five months later, on 3 March 1866, he was seized again on the orders of Captain Reginald Biggs, the local magistrate and militia commander. Fresh allegations had been made that he had provided covert assistance to a key leader of the Hauhau. However, the charges against him were probably false. Gilbert Mair later wrote that he did not consider allegations could be sustained against Te Kooti and the historian James Cowan also noted that many in Poverty Bay preferred Te Kooti be out of the way. Despite the likely untruth of the allegations, Te Kooti was deported, without trial, to the Chatham Islands.

===Confinement and escape===
On the Chatham Islands, around 300 prisoners were kept in poor conditions, forced to build their own housing and cultivate their food, while the Government worked towards the confiscation of their land. The prisoners were treated roughly by their guards and the harsh climate resulted in a number of deaths. During his confinement on the Chathams, Te Kooti began to have visions, following a period of illness. From these, he began to develop his own religion, which combined aspects of Christianity, drawn from the Old and New Testaments, and Māori beliefs. He called it Ringatū, or the Upraised Hand. He held services where he used phosphorus and legerdemain to create the illusion of flames being emitted from his hands. Even when placed in solitary confinement, he escaped at night to preach to his fellow detainees. 

Promises had been made to the prisoners that they would be released after two years. While some senior &quot;rangatira&quot; were allowed to leave, it did not eventuate for the remaining prisoners and they grew increasingly frustrated at their confinement. By this time Te Kooti had ascended to a leadership role among the prisoners and held significant influence. On 4 July 1868 Te Kooti led a carefully planned and executed breakout from their internment, overpowering guards, seizing arms and ammunition and commandeering a schooner, the &quot;Rifleman&quot;, which was moored at the settlement of Waitangi. Te Kooti had ordered that no one be harmed but one guard was killed in the uprising by a prisoner seeking vengeance for harsh treatment. A total of 298 people—163 men, 64 women and 71 children—sailed out of the Chatham Islands for mainland New Zealand. Te Kooti and his Ringatū followers arrived at a secluded cove at Whareongaonga, about halfway between Tūranga and Mahia to the south, on 10 July. The &quot;Rifleman&quot; and its co-opted crew were allowed to leave after the ship was unloaded of its cargo and passengers and sailed for Wellington. In the meantime, the presence of the escaped prisoners became known to the residents of Poverty Bay. The Government also became aware of the situation, which was of particular concern since there had been an outbreak of hostilities with Māori of South Taranaki, on the opposite coast of the North Island, led by the prominent &quot;rangatira&quot; Tītokowaru. A separate conflict on the East Coast was clearly undesirable.

On 12 July, a local &quot;rangatira&quot; was sent by Biggs to seek the surrender of the escapees but Te Kooti refused. Having been held for over two years without trial, he did not trust the Government. He made it clear he did not wish to fight but would do so if he and his followers were forced to defend themselves or were hindered from travelling to the interior of the North Island, where he intended to establish a kingship to rival that of Tāwhiao, the Māori king.

==Pursuit==

Biggs scrambled to assemble a force with which to confront Te Kooti at Whareongaonga—his militia volunteers, the Mounted Rifles under Captain Charles Westrupp, and some &quot;kūpapa &quot;, nearly 90 men in total. Two other parties were raised; about 25 militia and 100 &quot;kūpapa &quot; set out from Wairoa in Hawke&#x27;s Bay, while a few days later another 30 militia, accompanied by 40 &quot;kūpapa &quot; departed from Napier. The latter party, led by Colonel George Whitmore, the commander of the Armed Constabulary and in overall charge of the pursuit of Te Kooti, would later be joined by 50 men of the Armed Constabulary. 

Meanwhile, the Ringatū departed Whareongaonga on 15 July and began making their way to Paparatu, a &quot;pā&quot; (hillfort) about inland. Te Kooti&#x27;s fighting force amounted to around 150 to 160 warriors although only 40 to 50 of them had firearms. The Ringatū narrowly avoided being intercepted by Biggs and his men, who arrived at Whareongaonga too late to stop them. On discovering he had missed Te Kooti, Biggs marched his 70-strong force to Paparatu via a more direct route through open country, intending to cut off his quarry as they crossed the Arai Stream. He and his men reached Paparatu on 18 July where Biggs left Westrupp in command and returned to Tūranga to organise a resupply. On the morning of 20 July, the government forces sighted Te Kooti&#x27;s followers and moved onto two hills overlooking their route forward. Te Kooti split his armed men into two parties, one of which mounted intermittent attacks to the front as a diversion while the other worked its way around to the rear. This took several hours but at 4:00pm, the rearwards party attacked Westrupp&#x27;s force, killing two Europeans and forcing a retreat. Te Kooti seized food, arms and ammunition and 80 horses.

Westrupp&#x27;s men encountered Whitmore&#x27;s advancing column the next day. Despite Whitmore&#x27;s attempt to dissuade them, they refused to join his force and instead continued on back to Poverty Bay. The Wairoa force, commanded by Captain W. Richardson, was ordered to move against Te Kooti in order to delay their passage, while Whitmore took his men back to Napier to await his Armed Constabulary reinforcements. Richardson&#x27;s party, depleted by at least 50 of the &quot;kūpapa &quot; who refused to fight, attacked Te Kooti at Te Koneke on 24 July. It was a halfhearted affair and after the Ringatū warriors began to flank Richardson&#x27;s 75 or so men, the government forces withdrew and returned to Wairoa. Richardson claimed to have inflicted several casualties on Te Kooti&#x27;s men but this was likely inflated while his own force had one man killed and another wounded, albeit in a friendly fire incident.

Whitmore&#x27;s column, now reinforced with men of the Armed Constabulary and numbering around 200 men, followed Te Kooti&#x27;s tracks, having set out from Tūranga on 31 July, from where they had been transported via ship from Napier. The weather was poor and swelled the local rivers which they had to traverse, making progress slow. On 5 August at Waihau, the Poverty Bay militia that were part of Whitmore&#x27;s force refused to advance any further on the grounds they had reached the boundary of their district; Whitmore&#x27;s harsh treatment of them may have also been a factor. With the militia went their allied &quot;kūpapa&quot;. These departures reduced the column to around 120 men. The adverse weather also affected the progress of Te Kooti&#x27;s followers, which included women and children, to Paparatu. 

At Ruakituri Gorge, downstream from Puketapu, on 8 August, Whitmore&#x27;s column caught up with Te Kooti&#x27;s force. The column was strung out along the gorge on account of the difficult terrain and exposed to fire from Te Kooti&#x27;s men, some of whom had positioned themselves on an island mid-stream. Some militia and &quot;kūpapa &quot; of Ngāti Kahungunu managed to cross further downstream and fire on the reverse side of the island, which allowed the main body of Whitmore&#x27;s force to withdraw. Five men were killed and six wounded, three of whom later died of their wounds. Ringatū casualties were two men killed and nine wounded, Te Kooti among them, but in his reports back to the government, Whitmore overstated Ringatū losses. The outcome of the pursuit of Te Kooti was an embarrassment for the government and the commitment of some of the &quot;kūpapa &quot; involved was questioned by some of the colonials. Nevertheless, Whitmore favourably noted the performance of the Ngāti Kahungunu &quot;kūpapa &quot; at Ruakituri Gorge.

==Buildup of the Ringatū==
Resuming their trek, the Ringatū reached Puketapu a few days later. They would remain here for over two months, strengthening the &quot;pā&quot;&#x27;s fortifications, collecting supplies, and receiving reinforcements. The succession of victories over the previous few weeks attracted more recruits to Te Kooti&#x27;s cause, including Ngāti Kohatu chief Korohina Te Rakiroa and some of his men. 

Across the country in Taranaki meanwhile, government forces had suffered a defeat at the hands of Tītokowaru at Te Ngutu o Te Manu and Whitmore and his men were withdrawn in early September from the East Coast and sent to deal with the threat this presented. The government, eager to free further resources for use against Tītokowaru, seized the moment to offer Te Kooti a peace agreement. In mid-October Defence Minister Theodore Haultain directed that a message be sent to Te Kooti at Puketapu stating that if the prisoners surrendered themselves and their arms, no further proceedings would be taken against them and land would be found for them to live on. Catholic missionary Father Euloge Reignier was chosen to act as the emissary and negotiator, but was prevented from reaching Te Kooti and instead passed the message on via Pai Mārire warriors. If Te Kooti did receive the offer, he rejected it, suspicious of the government&#x27;s intentions and aware that its scouts had reconnoitered Puketapu.

The Ringatū had increased their numbers with a number of recruits including a &quot;rangatira&quot; of inland Wairoa, Te Waru Tamatea, a Pai Mārire convert, and Nama, both of Ngāti Kahungunu. With them came about 50 of their men. Te Kooti solicited for more followers to support his movement, dispatching messengers to tribes at Ōpōtiki and Taupō as well as the much closer Tūhoe, in the Urewera. As a result, about 30 Tūhoe warriors joined the Ringatū at Puketapu. This increased the number of fighting men in the Ringatū to around 250, but several still lacked firearms. Te Kooti pondered his next move, a trek into the Waikato region. Accordingly he sought Tāwhiao&#x27;s assent to enter the King Country and also asked Tūhoe chiefs permission to enter their land. While Tūhoe deferred their decision, Tāwhiao sent an outright rejection, warning the Ringatū would be repelled if they encroached on his territory.

==Poverty Bay attacks==
In early October, anger was roused in Poverty Bay when it was discovered that followers of Te Kooti had murdered some Ngāti Kahungunu leaders at Whataroa on the Mangaaruhe River near Ohuka. Ngāti Kahungunu was furious and were motivated to seek &quot;utu&quot; (revenge). At the same time, intelligence was received that Te Kooti planned to attack Wairoa. This was false, and was a deception mounted by Te Kooti. He instead intended to raid Poverty Bay. To his followers he proclaimed: &quot;God would give the Tūranganui country, and all the best places of the Europeans, back to him and his people&quot;. 

As a result of Te Kooti&#x27;s misinformation, Wairoa was reinforced, mainly with &quot;kūpapa&quot;, such that by 25 October, its garrison numbered about 700 men. It was then discovered that it was a false alarm. About 500 men set out from Wairoa for Puketapu under the command of Major Charles Lambert. They found it empty and returned to Wairoa on 6 November. As a precaution, Biggs, still considering an attack possible, posted scouts on the routes into the area coming from the south. He considered this the likely direction of Te Kooti&#x27;s approach. 

Te Kooti in the meantime had reached Patutahi, a village in the western hills overlooking Poverty Bay. Tūranga, on the mouth of the Waimata River, and nearby Matawhero, was home to about 150 European settlers and 500 Māori. Many of the men responsible for Te Kooti&#x27;s exile to the Chatham Islands lived in the area. From Patutahi, on the night of 9 November, Te Kooti led a 100-strong &quot;kokiri&quot; (attack party) into Poverty Bay. The &quot;kokiri&quot; was split into several smaller contingents and struck several properties in the area. The party led by Te Kooti surrounded Biggs&#x27; home at Matawhero where he, his wife, their baby and servants were fatally shot, clubbed and bayoneted. Another party, led by Nama, attacked the family of Captain James Wilson, killing him, a servant and three of his four children and fatally wounding his wife. The attackers moved on to other homes, slaughtering the families of other settlers who had fought with the militia forces and setting fire to their houses. Many of the killings were followed by the singing of Psalm 63, which concluded: &quot;They who seek my life will be destroyed ... they will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.&quot; Around 30 settlers, mostly younger men in the militia, were killed as well as 37 Māori.

The survivors fled to the safety of the redoubt at Tūranga. The next day, Lieutenant Frederick Gascoyne of the Colonial Defence Force, who was one of the scouts watching the southern routes to Wairoa, took command at the redoubt having seen Te Kooti&#x27;s men pillaging Matawhero when making his way to the town. This left Te Kooti in control of the area. He remained in the district until 17 November, collecting supplies and taking around 300 Māori prisoners of which between 20 and 40 were executed. He also had a local &quot;rangatira&quot;, Paratene Pototi, who had played a role in Te Kooti being sent to the Chathams, murdered along with six other &quot;rangatira&quot;. He then marched his followers and remaining prisoners inland to Makaretu, about from Tūranga. The position was not favourable; a flat area next to the Wharekōpae River. 

As a result of the massacre, the government were now determined to deal with Te Kooti, placing a bounty for his capture and bringing back Whitmore&#x27;s Armed Constabulary to the region. A party of 200 Ngāti Kahungunu from Napier had arrived at Tūranga and along with 140 warriors already there, departed with Gascoyne in pursuit of Te Kooti. They were joined by 100 Ngāti Rongowhakaata and a small contingent of Armed Constabulary. They headed inland to cut off Te Kooti&#x27;s passage to the Urewera Ranges; on 20 November two of his men were spotted and killed near Patutahi and the tracks of the rest were picked up. The chasing &quot;kūpapa&quot; reached Makaretu on 23 November and having more than double the number of Te Kooti&#x27;s men they promptly attacked across the flat area, which Te Kooti met with his warriors. The &quot;kūpapa&quot; were fended off and in doing so, one of the leaders of the Ngāti Kahungunu, Hamuora Tairoa, was killed. They dug in on a ridge about from Makaretu and waited for supplies of ammunition to be brought forward. However, Te Kooti sent a small raiding party to attack the depot that was the expected source of the supplies of ammunition and this proved successful. They routed the small garrison at the depot and plundered 16,000 rounds of ammunition for Te Kooti&#x27;s forces.

On 3 December, 180 Ngāti Porou fighters led by Ropata Wahawaha and Hotene Porourangi arrived. The Ngāti Porou were allied to the government and keen to enhance their interests by helping deal with the threat presented by Te Kooti. The &quot;kūpapa&quot;, now numbering 700, promptly attacked with the Ngāti Porou at the centre of the assault. However most of Te Kooti&#x27;s force had already escaped out the back of Makaretu, leaving behind a rearguard, most of whom were killed. Among the dead was Nama. Two prisoners were taken and Ropata ordered them to be executed. The leader of the Napier contingent of Ngāti Kahungunu, Tareha Te Moananui, refused to allow it and withdrew his 250 men from the pursuit. Te Kooti in the meantime had moved with his followers to Ngatapa &quot;pa&quot;, away.

==Siege of Ngatapa==
Ngatapa was a formidable &quot;pā&quot;, standing above sea level and surrounded by cliffs on three sides and dense bush on the side facing any opposing force. Te Kooti had hastily begun strengthening its defences with earthworks. On 4 December Ropata, with as few as 150 men, gained some ground in a rush on the pā, but was forced to abandon the assault a day later and return to Tūranga, short of gunpowder and men.

Desperate for arms and ammunition, Te Kooti led a second lightning raid on Tūranga on 12 December, killing some locals but failing to secure the supplies they needed. The raid galvanised Whitmore, who had arrived at Tūranga with his Armed Constabulary the previous week, to renew his campaign against Te Kooti, which he had decided just two days earlier to abandon after false reports that Te Kooti had quit Ngatapa and retired inland. He amassed a 600-man force—250 Europeans in the Armed Constabulary, 60 Te Arawa led by European officers and over 300 Ngāti Porou led by Ropata and Hotene Porourangi—at Ngatapa on 31 December and launched the attack the following day, quickly encircling the &quot;pā&quot; and its 500 occupants, and cutting off their water supply. A high rocky precipice on the north side of Ngatapa, considered far too steep for use as an escape route, was left unguarded. Heavy rain fell as the siege continued and Te Kooti abandoned his outer defences in the early hours of 5 January 1869 after Te Arawa and Ngāti Porou fighters climbed the rock face and kept up heavy fire, while others in Whitmore&#x27;s force provided covering fire.

Alerted by a woman&#x27;s cry later that there were no men left in the &quot;pā&quot;, the &quot;kūpapa&quot; entered to find mostly several women and children, most of them Te Kooti&#x27;s prisoners, plus some wounded warriors; the latter were promptly killed. At least 190 occupants of Ngatapa had descended from the unguarded steep rock outcrop, lowering themselves more than down the almost perpendicular face on vines woven to form a rope or ladder. Ngāti Porou set off in immediate pursuit and flushed out 130 male prisoners from the bush and gorges below. They were marched up the hill to the pā and executed. Around 135 women and children were spared execution, with most taken by Ngāti Porou as their own prisoners. About 20 male prisoners were kept to be put on trial. 

The government losses were 11 men killed; five Armed Constabulary and six Ngāti Porou. Te Kooti&#x27;s losses were far higher; having already lost 60 or so of his Ringatū warriors killed or taken prisoner at Makaretu, another 130, around half of his total fighting force, were killed at Ngatapa or executed in the aftermath of the siege when they were pursued through the bush following their escape from the &quot;pā&quot;. However, at least some of the executed were likely to have been Māori captured by Te Kooti in his raids in Poverty Bay rather than Ringatū.

==Retreat to the wilderness==
Contrary to the expectation of their pursuers, who believed that Te Kooti and his remaining Ringatū followers would attempt to return to Puketapu, they retreated to the northeast to the outskirts of the Urewera mountains. Basing themselves at Maraetahi, near Oponae, about south of Ōpōtiki in the Waioeka gorge, from January through to March, he had a dialogue with Tūhoe leaders who, stung by recent confiscations of their tribal land near Ohiwa, debated amongst themselves whether to support Te Kooti. On 2 March, he came to an agreement to defend the Urewera with Tūhoe support. In the meantime, his ranks soon expanded with warriors, mainly from Tūhoe but also other &quot;iwi&quot; in the surrounding areas, and he had amassed a fighting force of around 130 men.

Te Kooti went on the offensive a few days later, seeking to acquire weapons, ammunition and other supplies by raiding the area around Ohiwa Harbour and Whakatāne. He marched to the &quot;pā&quot; at Whakarae, under the control of Rakuraku, a Tūhoe &quot;rangatira&quot;, to the immediate south of Ohiwa Harbour and quickly gained its possession. He stayed for a few days, recruiting warriors and also ordering a surveyor, Robert Pitcairn, working nearby at Ohiwa, be killed. He then moved west and besieged a Ngāti Pūkeko &quot;pā&quot;, Rauporoa, on the west bank of the Whakatāne River. A Frenchman, Jean Guerren, who ran the local mill, was killed during the fighting at the &quot;pā&quot;; it was taken on 11 March and Te Kooti ordered Guerren&#x27;s wife, a Māori, be executed by her sister. Whakatāne itself was looted by one of Te Kooti&#x27;s detachments.

Before Rauporoa fell, messengers had been dispatched to Ōpōtiki seeking assistance. There, Major William Mair of the Armed Constabulary gathered a party of around 160 men but by the time they arrived at Rauporoa in the afternoon of 11 March, it had been abandoned. Te Kooti&#x27;s men could be seen in the distance, but Mair declined to pursue as his forces appeared outnumbered; he estimated that the Ringatū numbered around 250 to 300 warriors. At the same, a party led by Gilbert Mair, William&#x27;s brother, who had raised a force of 130 Te Arawa on his way to the area from Tauranga where he had heard of the events of Rauporoa, came across mounted Ringatū pursuing Ngāti Pūkeko who had fled Rauporoa. The Ringatū rejoined the rest of Te Kooti&#x27;s men and then turned and made to attack William Mair&#x27;s Ōpōtiki party, which then withdrew to Whakatāne. On 13 March he was joined there by Gilbert Mair and another Mair brother, Henry and waited for reinforcements. 

On 15 March, the Mairs led a party of 450, mostly &quot;kūpapa&quot; of Te Arawa, in pursuit of Te Kooti, who in the meantime had attacked a &quot;pā&quot; at Paharakeke on the Rangitaiki River. About 40 Ngāti Awa were coerced, forcibly or otherwise, to joining his Ringatū. The Mairs followed along the Rangitaiki and at dusk the next day caught up with Te Kooti at Tauaroa &quot;pā&quot;. A cordon was thrown around the &quot;pā&quot; but some of the &quot;kūpapa&quot; refused to move in the dark so the encirclement was incomplete. Te Kooti and his followers slipped out during the night and retreated into the Urewera. When the Mairs entered the next morning on realising the &quot;pā&quot; was empty, they found the body of a young Te Arawa warrior who had been tortured and killed. 

The following month, on 10 April, Te Kooti launched another surprise strike, this time on Mohaka, south of Wairoa. Mohaka was a village of Ngāti Pāhauwera, a &quot;hāpu&quot; of Ngāti Kahungunu, and was well supplied with ammunition, the securing of which was Te Kooti&#x27;s objective. His 150-strong force swept through Mohaka, killing many men, women and children and some nearby colonists before moving to their primary targets, Te Huki &quot;pā&quot; and the bigger Hiruharama &quot;pā&quot; on the coast. Te Huki was besieged overnight before being taken the next morning when Te Kooti proposed peace under a white flag. Once access to the &quot;pā&quot; was gained, its 26 occupants were killed. The raid netted Te Kooti enough ammunition to assault Hiruharama, but an attempted siege of the bigger &quot;pā&quot; collapsed when outside reinforcements led by Ihaka Whaanga of Ngāti Kahungunu arrived to help the defenders. Once again Te Kooti retreated to the Tūhoe heartland, the attack having killed 65 locals, mostly Māori. 

Te Kooti&#x27;s latest series of raids saw his numbers increase and he gained significant amount of supplies, although little ammunition. It also prompted the evacuation to Auckland of most European women and children in the Bay of Plenty. Urged by Henry Clarke, in charge of Native Affairs at Tauranga, the government instructed Whitmore to mount an invasion of the Urewera to deny Te Kooti a base for operations into the Bay of Plenty and the East Cape. By now, Te Kooti&#x27;s attacks on the Māori population in the East Cape area had pushed the various affected &quot;iwi&quot; towards alignment with the government in taking action against him.

==Invasion of the Urewera==
News of the March raids near Whakatāne had already reached Whitmore in Taranaki, who by then was abandoning his pursuit of Tītokowaru. Whitmore and Native Affairs Minister James Richmond resolved to shift the main colonial force to the east coast and by 20 April Whitmore and 600 Armed Constabulary were in Ōpōtiki, preparing for the formidable task of invading the Urewera mountains with the twin aims of capturing Te Kooti and destroying all Tūhoe settlements, and thereby their ability to shelter him. 

Whitmore planned an invasion using three separate columns, all targeting Ruatāhuna, the expected centre of resistance. The first column was to start from Wairoa in the south and cross Lake Waikaremoana; this force was led by Lieutenant Colonel J. L. Herrick. The second, under Lieutenant-Colonel St John, was from Ōpōtiki in the north, pushing up the Whakatāne River. The third was led by Whitmore and this would move up the Rangitaiki River and enter the Urewera from the west. The invasion force outnumbered the total population of the Urewera and involved about 1300 troops: 620 constabulary, 95 militia and 500 &quot;kupapa&quot;, evenly divided between the three lines of advance. 

The first action involved Whitmore&#x27;s column attacking Te Harema &quot;pā&quot; at Te Whaiti around noon on 6 May. Six defenders were killed and 50 prisoners, most of them women and children, were taken. The former were given to the Arawa contingent while the &quot;pā&quot; was looted and later burned. Whitmore continued on to Ruatāhuna, rendezvousing with St John&#x27;s column on 7 May; the latter had attacked a kāinga at Omaruoteane, killing three men. The two commanders spent the next few days systematically destroying all settlements, crops and livestock in Ruatāhuna in an attempt to drive the Tūhoe people to starvation. The mission faltered on 12 May when, after a brief clash with Te Kooti&#x27;s advance guard, the Arawa fighters refused to advance beyond Ruatāhuna. Some of the government forces, including Whitmore, were afflicted with dysentery by this time and Whitmore&#x27;s men withdrew from the Urewera within a week. As justification, they blamed the caution of the Arawa. Herrick&#x27;s expedition meanwhile pushed on, finally reaching Onepoto, at Lake Waikaremoana&#x27;s south, on 24 May, and labored at building boats to cross to the north side of the lake to where Te Kooti was sheltering. This venture continued until 8 July when Herrick, advised of Te Kooti&#x27;s departure from the Urewera, scuttled his boats and returned south. The cost of the expedition, some £40,000 to £60,000, was an embarrassment to the government although Whitmore would subsequently claim it was a success. His scorched earth strategy had achieved its aim; in late May Tūhoe chiefs turned on Te Kooti and demanded he leave their territory and early the following month he left for Taupō. 

Te Kooti and his party, about 150 warriors and some women, headed for Taupō. On the way he launched a raid on an encampment of militia cavalry from the Bay of Plenty at Opepe, about from Lake Taupō, on 7 June. The militia were an escort party for Colonel St. John, who was scouting potential positions for forts and had gone on ahead. The militia at Opepe were expecting to be joined by some &quot;kupapa&quot; and took Te Kooti&#x27;s vanguard to be who they were waiting for. Once Te Kooti&#x27;s men entered the encampment they killed nine militia while five others escaped. Te Kooti gained all their arms and supplies. 

He destroyed the pā of two &quot;hapu&quot; who had earlier refused to give him refuge or assistance, then arrived on 10 June at Tauranga, at the southern end of Lake Taupō, occupying the settlement for more than a week before moving to Moerangi, southwest of the lake, taking more prisoners as he travelled.

Early in July Te Kooti and his followers and prisoners, a group of possibly more than 800, set off for Tokangamutu, the temporary residence of Māori king Tāwhiao near Te Kūiti, where he hoped to either force Tāwhiao into an alliance or topple him.

==Challenge to King Tāwhiao==
A meeting between Te Kooti and Tāwhiao, had it taken place, would have been a confrontation of two prophets and leaders who had taken diametrically opposed positions on further war with the government. While Te Kooti viewed warfare as the means by which his vision of the return of their land would be fulfilled, Tāwhiao had renounced armed conflict and declared 1867–68 as the &quot;year of the lamb&quot; and &quot;year of peace&quot;; in April 1869 he had issued another proclamation that &quot;the slaying of man by man is to cease&quot;. Though there were radical elements in the Kingitanga movement who favoured a resumption of war, including Rewi Maniapoto and possibly Tāwhiao himself, moderates continued to warn the King that the Ringatū had little chance of success. Te Kooti had been angered by Tāwhiao&#x27;s refusal the previous November to send reinforcements during their campaigns near Tūranga and had then threatened that if he remained aloof he would be cursed by Jehovah, who would command Te Kooti to march to Te Kuiti and put the king and his people to the sword. 

Tāmati Ngāpora, a senior adviser to the King, had invited Te Kooti to Te Kuiti, but on the proviso that he came in peace. Te Kooti&#x27;s response was one of defiance, warning that he was coming to &quot;assume himself the authority which he coming directly from God was entitled to&quot;. His chief aim for the visit was simple: to rouse Tāwhiao&#x27;s support for renewed war against the government and wrest back the confiscated land. Accompanied by Horonuku and about 200 Ngāti Tuwharetoa, he arrived at Te Kuiti on 10 July 1869, immediately declaring that he was the host (&quot;tangata whenua&quot;) and that the Waikato were his visitors. At an assembly attended by 200 Waikato Māori, Te Kooti urged them to hold the land and keep up the fighting. But though Te Kooti remained there for 15 days, with the village in a heightened state of tension as he continued to challenge the &quot;mana&quot; of the king, Tāwhiao refused to emerge from his home to meet him. The Kingitanga movement eventually decided to support Te Kooti, although not in outright hostilities—as well as a place of sanctuary inland on the Mokau River under the protection of Ngāti Maniapoto. 

News of Te Kooti&#x27;s presence in Te Kuiti, and the prospect of the two Māori leaders forming an alliance, alarmed the government. Premier William Fox said the development heightened &quot;the probability of a combined attack on the settled districts in the neighbourhood of Auckland&quot; and both Houses of Parliament accepted government motions asking Major-General Sir Trevor Chute, commander of the British forces in New Zealand, to cancel orders for a planned withdrawal of the 18th Regiment, the sole remaining British regiment in New Zealand. Yet Binney has speculated that history could well have turned had Tāwhiao decided to join Te Kooti&#x27;s campaign. In official correspondence between Auckland and London in 1869, Governor George Bowen advocated granting &quot;a separate principality&quot; for Tāwhiao as a means of attaining peace, while the British government similarly urged the colonial government to &quot;cede the lands conquered by the Queen&#x27;s troops&quot; and surrender &quot;the Queen&#x27;s sovereignty&quot; in those areas, while recognising &quot;absolute dominion&quot; by the King within his borders. Premier Fox, who was desperately trying to cut military expenditure, strongly opposed proposals for Māori self-government under the Māori king, as urged by Bowen and former Chief Justice Sir William Martin, but the formation of a more robust pan-Māori alliance could have become a tipping point to create a system of separate Māori rule in their territory.

== Taupō campaign and defeat at Te Pōrere ==
Accompanied by Rewi Maniapoto, Te Kooti and his followers left Te Kuiti and returned to Taupō, settling briefly at its southern end on 18 August before launching a Taupō campaign that took him to the brink of defeat. News of his return prompted the formation near Taupō of a 700-strong government force, with all but about 100 of them &quot;kupapa&quot;: Ngāti Kahungunu (230 men), Wanganui (160), Ngāti Tuwharetoa (130) and Arawa (50). On 10 September 1869 Te Kooti&#x27;s force of about 280 mounted a pre-emptive strike against a 120-man mounted Ngāti Kahungunu contingent, led by Henare Tomoana, which was camped at Tauranga-Taupō. But although Te Kooti took their horses and much of their equipment, he was forced to retreat under heavy fire. Three of his force were killed and several wounded. They then retreated to Moerangi, inside the relative security of the &quot;Rohe Pōtae&quot; or King&#x27;s territory—an area the government considered too dangerous to attack, for fear of reviving Kingitanga aggression. At this point Rewi separated from Te Kooti and returned to the Waikato, unimpressed by Te Kooti&#x27;s performance in battle and angered by the slaughter at Rotoaira on 7 September of four Māori scouts with Waikato connections. Any chance of a compact between Te Kooti and the Kingitanga had now vanished. 

Less than two weeks later, on the morning of 25 September, Te Kooti returned to Tokaanu with 250 to 300 fighters for what eventuated as a disastrous attack. After striking from the densely forested hills of Te Ponanga saddle south of Tokaanu, they were driven back by a joint force of Henare Tomoana&#x27;s Ngāti Kahungunu and Hohepa Tamamutu&#x27;s Tuwharetoa. Te Kooti dug in at nearby Te Ponanga, but lost seven in battle, including Wi Piro, a close relative who had been prominent in all the Ringatū raids. The heads of his wounded warriors were severed by members of the government force. 

But the most ignominious defeat was to come. Amid sleet, snow and driving winds, Te Kooti began preparing an earthwork redoubt at Te Pōrere near Papakai village, about 9 km west of Lake Rotoaira on the lower northwest slopes of Mount Tongariro. The redoubt was built in the form of a European fortification, about 20 metres square, with 3 metre-high walls built of sod and pumice, bound with layers of fern. The structure was designed for a fixed battle, a style of conflict that Te Kooti had previously avoided. Government forces, under the command of Major Thomas McDonnell, arrived at Papakai in the first week of October and launched an assault with 540 men on the morning of 4 October in heavy rain. Ngāti Kahungunu and Arawa forces led by Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui—better known to Pākehā as Major Kemp—quickly took the outer trenches, then stormed the redoubt, discovering a fatal design flaw hindered the ability of those inside to effectively maintain fire on an attack force: the loopholes in the parapets had been built without allowing warriors to depress their gun barrels and aim at targets below. As the fight raged, Captain John St George—who had fought since 1865 against Pai Marire and Ringatū forces—was killed while leading his force on a charge, and a bullet struck Te Kooti in the hand and severed a finger. It was his third injury in battle, after sustaining an ankle injury at Puketapu and a shoulder wound at Ngatapa. In what turned out to be the last major battle of the New Zealand Wars, between 37 and 52 of Te Kooti&#x27;s force were killed—a sixth of his fighting force—and more than 20 women and children taken prisoner at Te Pōrere. The government loss was four killed and four wounded. Within days Horonuku, who had been sheltering in the bush after escaping, surrendered. Belich noted: &quot;Te Porere was Te Kooti&#x27;s last stand in a prepared position, and his last attempt at anything other than raid, ambush and the evasion of pursuit.&quot;

==Flight and pursuit==
Te Kooti and his followers—men, women and children—separated and scattered after the Te Pōrere defeat, many of them finding shelter in bushland in the upper Whanganui River. On 9 November Defence Minister Donald McLean met Rewi Maniapoto, Tāmati Ngāpora and other Kingitanga chiefs, demanding that they surrender Te Kooti. Rewi refused, declaring that he would provide a sanctuary for Te Kooti within the &quot;Rohe Pōtae&quot; as long as he remained peaceful, but would hand him over if he caused trouble. But at a hui of upper Whanganui chiefs 10 days later, influential chief Topia Turoa declared that in revenge for earlier killings by Te Kooti of several kinsmen and a priest in the Taupō district, he would start his own search for the Ringatū leader from the east, while Te Keepa (Major Kemp) would comb the forest from Taupō in the west. Topia&#x27;s campaign against Te Kooti and his 30 immediate followers gained the approval of Tāwhiao, who now reversed his oath to sheath the sword, and the Whanganui chief sent out almost 400 scouts in search of his quarry. 

At the end of December 1869 to the first week of January 1870 both Te Keepa and Topia and their combined force of 600 came close to capturing Te Kooti—again with a fighting force of about 90 and 200 women and children—in the upper Whanganui River near Taumarunui but were thwarted by floodwaters. On 16 January he reappeared at Tapapa, in the Waikato district, and arranged a meeting with Matamata settler and runholder Josiah Firth a day later. He sought Firth&#x27;s help in achieving a truce with the government. He told him he would not surrender to the authorities, but said: &quot;I am weary of fighting, and desire to live quietly at Tapapa. If I am let alone I will never fight more, and will not hurt man, woman or child.&quot; 

Firth passed the message to Daniel Pollen, the government&#x27;s agent for Auckland province, who promised that no military movement would occur while the two negotiated. But when Pollen returned to Auckland to pass on Te Kooti&#x27;s proposal, he was rebuked by Fox, who ordered the agent to cease interfering in the military campaign. Fox wrote to Pollen that Te Kooti was &quot;a midnight murderer of defenceless women and helpless children ... a man of atrocious cruelty and outrage&quot; who was &quot;repudiated and abhorred by the bulk of his people&quot;.

Fox continued preparations for a large-scale confrontation and within days substantial forces were closing in on Tapapa: McDonnell and 250 men approached from Tokaanu up the eastern side of Lake Taupō; Te Keepa, Topia and 370 Wanganuis moved up the west side; Lieutenant-Colonel William Moule and 135 constabulary and militia came south from Cambridge and Lieutenant-Colonel James Fraser with 90 constabulary and 150 Arawa moved to block Te Kooti&#x27;s retreat to the Urewera. Another 210 Arawa were also on the march to join McDonnell. Against those 1200 men, Te Kooti may have had as few as 100 men. Te Kooti slipped out of Tapapa as the force arrived, and on 24 January the government forces seized and burned the deserted village. Early the next morning Te Kooti launched a surprise raid on the military camp, with each side losing about four men before Te Kooti was driven off. Although Te Keepa managed to recapture about 100 of the horses Te Kooti had been using, the government party lost the trail of the skilled guerrilla fighter.

On 3 February 1870 there was one more skirmish as Te Kooti and 40 warriors, camping in dense bush at Paengaroa as they travelled north towards present-day Te Puke, ambushed a 236-strong force led by Fraser, killing three or four, before vanishing again as they headed south. Four days later they appeared beside Lake Rotorua, where Te Kooti sought a truce directly with Te Mamaku and local Arawa, and asked local Māori for permission for his party—240 men and 100 women—to cross their land towards Ruatāhuna in the Urewera. Gilbert Mair, who arrived soon after with a contingent of Arawa fighters, was angered by the request, which was being considered by local chiefs, and ordered his men to pursue Te Kooti. Following just behind, Mair&#x27;s force began a chase that turned into a series of running battles, engaging the rearguard of Te Kooti&#x27;s forces before being halted by an ambush. Two of Te Kooti&#x27;s two key fighters, Peka Mākarini and Timoti Hakopa died in that engagement and as night fell, Te Kooti and about 200 with him plunged into the bush, moving rapidly southeast through the night beyond Lake Rotokākahi before emerging in the Urewera, and under the protection of the Tūhoe. As a result of the events of 7 February, Te Kooti lost considerable mana as well as at least 11 of his men. Mair was later awarded the New Zealand Cross for his role in these events.

Within days McDonnell was relieved of his command and McLean, as Native Minister, announced that from 11 February Māori would control all the expeditions into the Urewera, with no European involvement. There would be no daily pay for soldiers; instead they would compete for £5,000 reward offered for Te Kooti&#x27;s capture. The pursuit was instead led by both Te Keepa with his Whanganui warriors, and Ropata and his Ngāti Porou. Two columns of Te Arawa warriors would also be involved and Mair was to accompany them.

On February 28 Te Kooti struck south of Whakatāne, destroying a mill of an enemy chief, then a week later raided Opape, east of Ōpōtiki, seizing arms and gunpowder and capturing more than 170 men, women and children, intending to hold them ransom to gain more male fighters for his force. He retreated to Maraetahi in the Waioeka gorge, where just over a year earlier he had established a small village, complete with acres of maize and other crops. Te Kooti remained undisturbed there for a month until the arrival on March 25 of forces led by both Ropata—picking their way up the boulder-strewn Waioeka River from the north—and Te Keepa, who was marching down the river from the south. An hour-long firefight erupted before the village and nearby Raipawa pā were taken. About 300 occupants were taken prisoner, all but 87 of them being Whakatohea prisoners, and about 19 taken captive were executed in the riverbed by tomahawk or gun. Te Kooti managed to flee with about 20 men.

This was the end of the involvement of the Whanganui contingent in the pursuit of Te Kooti. Te Keepa and his men had been on the march for three months. They were operating far from their own territory, fighting on behalf of the Government against an enemy who had never threatened his own people. They felt they had done enough and wanted to go home. McLean arranged their return to Whanganui. He also promised Ngāti Porou the Government would relinquish its claim to land on the East Cape. This incentivised Ropata to raise yet another contingent of Ngāti Porou to pursue Te Kooti.

In July 1871 Ropata and his Ngāti Porou, joined by Mair and Captain George Preece leading a taua (war party) of Arawa, ranged through the Urewera Mountains, subjugating the Tūhoe and forcing them to hand over any fugitives they were sheltering. One welcome catch who fell into Ropata&#x27;s hands was Kereopa Te Rau, accused of Volkner&#x27;s murder; he was worth £1,000 to his captors.

On 22 September 1871, Captains Mair and Preece started from Fort Galatea on another Urewera expedition. The Arawa forces unexpectedly came upon Te Kooti&#x27;s camp, which was taken after a brief skirmish. Wi Heretaunga was captured. He was believed to a participant in the murders of Captain James Wilson and his family at Matawhero in November 1868. He was also accused of being involved in the Mohaka massacre in April 1869. It was decided, that he should be shot, and this summary execution was carried out. When in camp Te Kooti usually slept some distance away from his followers. This habit had saved him at Maraetahi and it did so again. He was almost killed but another man intercepted the bullet. He fired one shot and fled, naked, into the bush, and the hunt continued. At the end of the year, Ropata and his men withdrew from the Urewera and went home, ending the Ngāti Porou pursuit of Te Kooti. Only Te Arawa remained in the field.

On 14 February 1872, Preece and his Te Arawa were at the junction of the Waiau and Mangaone Streams, where they found a camp that had just been occupied by Te Kooti. They then spotted a group of people climbing the cliff on the opposite side of the flooded stream. One of them was Te Kooti. Shots were fired at the party but they missed and Te Kooti and his followers slipped away. These were the last shots fired in the New Zealand Wars.

On 15 May 1872 Te Kooti crossed the Waikato River and once again entered the territory of the Māori king, Tāwhiao. This time he approached the King as supplicant and was granted asylum.

==Pardon and later years==
In February 1883, the Government formally pardoned Te Kooti as part of a deal with Tāwhiao to put the Main Trunk Line through the King Country. Te Kooti showed his gratitude the following month by rescuing a surveyor, Wilson Hursthouse, who had been taken prisoner, stripped and chained up by disciples of Te Whiti o Rongomai, a prophet from Parihaka.

However Te Kooti remained unrepentant and belligerent. He went about armed with a revolver and threatened to take his gang back to Poverty Bay. He travelled extensively holding meetings to spread the Ringatū message. He was often accompanied by large groups of supporters to places such as Whakatāne and Ōpōtiki. An observer noted 1,000 people gathered to hear him and the resident magistrate commented that for once Te Kooti was sober. Te Kooti was still far from popular with all Maori and was accused by chiefs of practicing makutu (black magic) to kill senior chiefs who he had previously opposed him. 

Chiefs were concerned that groups such as Ngāti Awa and Ngāti Pūkeko would hand over the land to Te Kooti without any authority. The chiefs wrote to parliament to complain that Te Kooti was claiming mana over their land and instructing that the land should not be bought before the Native Land Court. The chiefs were also concerned that the supplies of the communities were being drained by massive hui leading to the people being ill-prepared to face winter. Chiefs complained that Te Kooti was forcing his adherents to raise money for him by selling family crops and animals. School teachers and native officers sent report to the government that this was resulting in children being malnourished. Te Kooti, conscious of his age, decided to return to Poverty Bay. This alarmed the government and the people of Poverty Bay. In February a telegram signed by a number of Ngāti Porou chiefs went to parliament saying they would rise up if Te Kooti did not turn back.

The government was keen to keep the peace. The Minister of Defence was concerned that Te Kooti had been directly threatened by his old adversaries Ropata and the Ngāti Porou. The Prime Minister arranged a meeting in Auckland between himself, Te Kooti and the Native Minister where he was offered government land if he stayed away from Gisborne. Although cordial, Te Kooti told the officials that he was determined to return. As a token of his peaceful intentions he surrendered a small revolver that he normally carried. The government shipped troops and artillery to Gisborne to form a military force of 377 under Major Porter in early 1889. Rumours of threats continued until the force went to Waioeka Pa and found Te Kooti drunk with 4 of his wives and some 400 supporters, who were arrested. He was bound over to keep the peace but as he could not afford the fine or bond he was taken to Mt Eden jail in Auckland where he was persuaded by the Ladies Temperance Movement to take the pledge against drinking alcohol and imprisoned for a short time before being released. Te Kooti wrote a letter of apology to the government explaining that his recent conduct had been caused by drink. 

Eventually in 1891 the government gave him an area of land at Wainui, at Ōhiwa Harbour in the Bay of Plenty, where a marae for the Ringatū church was later established. In February 1893 Te Kooti was injured in an accident involving the cart in which he was travelling to Ōhiwa Harbour. Although he resumed his journey he succumbed to his injuries on 17 April 1893. Originally buried at Maromahue, Waiotahe, his followers later removed and hid his remains.

==Aftermath==
A 2013 Waitangi Tribunal report said the action of Crown forces on the East Coast from 1865 to 1869, during the East Coast Wars and the start of Te Kooti&#x27;s War, resulted in the deaths of proportionately more Māori than in any other district during the New Zealand Wars. It condemned the &quot;illegal imprisonment&quot; on the Chatham Islands of a quarter of the East Coast region&#x27;s adult male population and said the loss in war of an estimated 43 per cent of the male population, many through acts of &quot;lawless brutality&quot;, was a stain on New Zealand&#x27;s history and character.

In May 2013, at the tangi of MP Parekura Horomia, the Tūhoe iwi, who had initially supported Te Kooti and the rebel Hau Hau movement in their 19th century war against the government, gave a gift to Ngāti Porou to end nearly 150 years of bitterness between the tribes. Ngāti Porou had provided many of the soldiers who tracked down the guerilla leader in the late 1860s and had numerous conflicts with Tūhoe Hau Hau. During one conflict 120 Tūhoe Hau Hau were captured and killed. Tūhoe leader Tu Waaka said he did not want successive generations to be encumbered by the events of the past.

==In fiction==
* Maurice Shadbolt&#x27;s novel &quot;Season of the Jew&quot; is set during Te Kooti&#x27;s War
* The movie &quot;Utu&quot; is based very loosely around some incidents from Te Kooti&#x27;s War
* In 1927 a film The Te Kooti Trail was released based on events in Te Kooti&#x27;s War. It was first banned by the censors office because of &#x27;disturbing realism&#x27; but later cleared for release after it was proved the events depicted were based on truth.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1983.

== Events ==

===January===
* France agrees to supply Iraq with five Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard strike fighters capable of firing the Exocet anti-ship missile.
* January 1 – Eastern Air Lines makes its first Boeing 757 revenue flight.
* January 2 – In the Iran–Iraq War, Iraqi Air Force aircraft in the Persian Gulf attack a convoy of merchant ships from the Iranian port of Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni, setting fire to the Singaporean cargo ship &quot;Eastern&quot; and the Liberian cargo ship &quot;Orient Horizon&quot;, forcing them both to run aground.
* January 5 – United Airlines begins the first scheduled nonstop service between the continental United States and Maui.
*January 16 – The Turkish Airlines Boeing 727-2F2 &quot;Afyon&quot;, operating as Flight 158, lands short of the runway in driving snow at Esenboğa International Airport in Ankara, Turkey. The plane breaks up and catches fire, killing 47 of the 67 people on board.
* January 18 – The Iraqi Air Force conducts a major raid against civilian and economic targets in Iran, claiming to have dispatched 66 sorties but actually sending more. The raid is made with inadequate fighter escort for attack aircraft and poor crew training in evading Iranian ground antiaircraft defenses, and some aircraft are lost due to insufficient maintenance or because they have been sent to targets that are too far away, causing them to run out of fuel on the way home.
* January 20 – Out on probation for hijacking Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 608 at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport outside Seattle, Washington, in July 1980, 20-year-old Glenn Kurt Tripp again hijacks Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 608, a Boeing 727 with 41 people on board bound for Portland, Oregon. After it takes off from Seattle, he tells a flight attendant that he has bomb in a box he is holding and demands to be flown to Afghanistan, but agrees to allow the airliner to land at Portland to refuel. After three hours of negotiations at Portland, Tripp agrees to allow half the passengers to disembark and while they do, two U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents climb aboard the plane through its cockpit windows and confront Tripp. When Tripp moves as if to throw his box at them, one agent fires a single shot that kills him. The box turns out to contain no explosives.
* January 25–30 – The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force attacks civilian and economic targets in Iraq.
* January 30 – Sun Country Airlines begins operations.

<text>Chinese tea culture () includes all facets of tea (茶 chá) found in Chinese culture throughout history. Physically, it consists of tea cultivation, brewing, serving, consumption, arts, and ceremonial aspects. Tea culture is an integral part of traditional Chinese material culture and spiritual culture. Tea culture emerged in the Tang dynasty, and flourished in the succeeding eras as a major cultural practice and as a major export good. 

Chinese tea culture heavily influenced the cultures in neighboring East Asian countries, such as Japan and Korea, with each country developing a slightly different form of the tea ceremony. Chinese tea culture, especially the material aspects of tea cultivation, processing, and teaware also influenced later adopters of tea, such as India, the United Kingdom, and Russia (even though these tea cultures diverge considerably in preparation and taste).

Tea is still consumed regularly in modern China, both on casual and formal occasions. In addition to being a popular beverage, tea is used as an integral ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine as well as in Chinese cuisine.

==Etymology==

The concept of &quot;tea culture&quot; is referred to in Chinese as &quot;chayi&quot; (&quot;the art of drinking tea&quot;), or &quot;cha wenhua&quot; (&quot;tea culture&quot;). The word &quot;cha&quot; () denotes the beverage that is derived from &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;, the tea plant. Prior to the 8th century BCE, tea was known collectively under the term (pinyin: tú) along with a great number of other bitter plants. This term is found in the &quot;Shi Jing&quot; (&quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;). These two Chinese characters are identical, with the exception of an additional horizontal stroke in the Chinese lettering 荼, which translates to tea. The older character is made up of the radical (pinyin: cǎo) in its reduced form of and the character (pinyin: yú), which gives the phonetic cue.

During the Han dynasty, the word tu took on a new pronunciation, &#x27;cha&#x27;, in addition to its old pronunciation &#x27;tu&#x27;. The syllable &#x27;tu&#x27; (荼) later evolved into &#x27;te&#x27; in the Fujian dialect, and later &#x27;tea&#x27;, &#x27;te&#x27;.

Tea was also called &#x27;jia&#x27; (檟) in the ancient Chinese classic &quot;Er Ya&quot; compiled during the early Han dynasty which states: &quot;Jia is bitter tu&quot;. The word tu was further annotated by a Jin scholar, Guo Pu (276–324 CE): &quot;Tu is a small plant, its leaves can be brewed into a beverage&quot;. Tea was also called &quot;She&#x27; (蔎) in a West Han monograph on dialect called the &quot;Fang Yian&quot;. The syllable &quot;jia&#x27; (檟) later became &#x27;cha&#x27; and &#x27;chai&#x27; (Russia, India). Meanwhile, the syllable &#x27;she&#x27; (蔎) later became &#x27;soh&#x27; in Jiangsu, Suleiman&#x27;s &#x27;Sakh&#x27; also came from &#x27;she&#x27;. 

== History ==
=== Legends ===
Tea was identified in Southwest China over four thousand years ago. Ancient Chinese sources like the &quot;Classic of Tea&quot; and the &quot;Shennong Ben Cao Jing&quot; credit Shen Nong, a mythical patron of medicine and agriculture, as the first person to discover the effects of tea in China. He was known to have tasted numerous leaves to determine if they could be used as food or medicine. According to legend, there are two different accounts telling how he discovered tea&#x27;s beneficial attributes. First, it is said he had a transparent stomach where he could see how his stomach was reacting to what he ate. After a long day of picking leaves, he was tired, and when he was boiling water, some leaves fell in. It was sweet when he drank the water, and he enjoyed the taste. Soon after that, he became more energized. In the second accounting, Shen Nong tasted 72 poisonous leaves and became very sick, and was close to death. When some leaves fell beside him, he put them in his mouth and chewed them. Before long, he was feeling better and more energized, so he ate more leaves. Soon after, the poison left his body. The first book written about the medical effects of tea was the &quot;Shen Nong Herbal&quot;.

=== Pre-history ===
The geographical home of tea in China is in the southern regions (such as Yunnan and Sichuan), the homelands of the Hani, Yi, Bai, Dai, Bulang, Wa, and De’ang ethnic groups. It is believed that various peoples from southern China had been eating tea leaves since ancient pre-historic times. These ethnic groups continue to eat tea leaves in traditional ways today. 

=== The early dynasties ===
11th to 7th century BCE Chinese sources mention a drink called &quot;tu&quot; (荼 &quot;bitter herb&quot;). While some have seen these mentions as indicating that tea was being consumed at this time, we cannot be sure that this was &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot;. The question of the identity of &quot;tu&quot; is a much debated one among modern scholars. The &quot;Erya&quot;, a Chinese dictionary dated to the 3rd century BCE, records that an infusion of tu, which it defines as a &quot;bitter vegetable&quot;. Records also indicate that ritual worship during the Zhou dynasty included ceremonies led by officials which used &quot;bitter herb&quot; drinks. The herb was considered an exotic plant from southern China, so it was offered as tribute to the emperor and was served to the nobles. In the third century BCE, tea is mentioned as an alternative to wine. Xia Zhong&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on Food&quot; states &quot;since Jin dynasty, the people of Wu (now Suzhou city) cooked tea leaves as food, and called it tea broth&quot;. 

From the end of the Spring and Autumn period in the Early Western Han dynasty the &quot;bitter herb&quot; was used as a table vegetable food, often drunk in a soup with onions, ginger and other additives. In 2016, the discovery of the earliest known physical evidence of tea from the mausoleum of Emperor Jing of Han (d. 141 BCE) in Xi&#x27;an was announced, indicating that tea from the genus &quot;Camellia&quot; was drunk by Han dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE) emperors as early as the 2nd century BCE. The first recorded cultivation of tea during the Han is dated to the era of Emperor Xuan (53–50 BC), when tea was planted on Meng Mountain, east of Chengdu where many Buddhist monasteries grew and processed Mengding Ganlu tea (Sweet Dew tea), sending some of it to the emperor as tribute tea. During the Han, improved picking and processing of wild tea refined the taste of tea. According to Victor H. Mair, the processing of tea at this time included steaming the leaves, pounding them and patting them into cakes which were then baked, pierced, and strung together in a string before storage.

During Jin dynasty (266–420), tea was boiled with other plants to make a tea soup which was considered a combination of medicine, food, and drink. According to the 3rd century CE &quot;Guangya dictionary,&quot; &quot;In the region between Jing and Ba [the area between modern eastern Sichuan and the western parts of Hunan and Hubei] the people pick the leaves and make a cake. If the leaves are old, rice paste is used in forming the cake. [People who] wish to brew the tea first roast [the cake] until it is a reddish color, pound it into a powder, put it into a ceramic container, and cover it with boiling water. They stew scallion [spring onion], ginger, and orange peel with it.&quot; 

As the tea culture developed during the Jin (266–420) and Wei period (220–265), it became more popular in the upper classes, including scholar-officials, Buddhist monks, and royals. Tea was set against wine as a beneficial drink, with wine being ‘violence and intoxication’ and tea ‘freshness and purity&#x27;. During this period, refined forms of tea became the backdrop to deep philosophical discussions between learned men, Taoists and Buddhist monks. Buddhists believed it helped prevent tiredness and promoted wakefulness, while Taoists believed it kept a person young and healthy. 

Before the Tang dynasty, refined tea was consumed as a social drink (as opposed to as a food) mainly by the upper classes. It continued to be used as a vegetable and herb soup by commoners, especially in the south. For the elites, tea was used as a medicinal health drink, a sacrifice, tribute, for ceremonial purposes or as an energizing drink. Refined expensive teas or &quot;tribute teas&quot; like Mengding Ganlu were not available to the masses during this early period.

=== Tang dynasty (618–906) ===


During the Tang dynasty, tea culture or ‘the art of tea’ as a pleasurable social activity (instead of as food, a ritual or medicine) began to spread widely throughout China. At this time, elite tea was now being drunk mostly on its own instead of as part of a soup, though some additives were still used sometimes, like a pinch of salt or certain kinds of flowers. New methods of growing and processing tea were developed, making it easier to produce more tea (all of which was green tea at this time) and improving its flavor. A new tea-making technique of roasting and baking leaves was also invented during this period. Tea production grew, especially in Meng Mountain region (in Sichuan) and in Fuliang (Jiangxi). 

Tea was widely consumed by the Tang emperor and his household, and who received the highest quality tea as &quot;tribute tea&quot; from tea producing regions. A famous tribute tea from this time was a purple-shoot tea from Guzhu mountain, on the western side of Lake Tai. Tea also began to be taxed and directly managed during the Tang. This put pressure on the commoners, who were also sometimes press-ganged to harvest tea for the emperor and on merchants, who often resorted to smuggling tea (which could carry the death penalty). Large scale tea smuggling, often by river boat, was a profitable venture for bandits and smugglers during the Tang. 

During the Tang era, the southern Tea Horse Road trade network led to mature trade routes between China and Tibet where Chinese tea was traded for Tibetan horses that the Chinese needed for their military. Furthermore, the completion of the Grand Canal established a cost-effective method of transporting goods between northern and southern China, making tea less expensive throughout the empire. Opening up trade routes and new processing techniques was vital to establishing tea as a national drink throughout China. Thus, from the Tang period onward, tea became one of the &quot;seven necessities.&quot; 

The leading high-end teaware of this period was the celadon Yue ware and the white glazed Xing ware. Both were patronized by the Tang imperial court. Also during this period, artisans produced hundreds of examples of tea art, such as poems, drawings, songs, and literature. Tea houses and tea shops were also established during this time.

==== Buddhism and tea ====
During the Tang, tea became a central part of the life of Buddhist monks, who were not allowed to drink alcohol or eat solid food after noon as per the Buddhist monastic code. According to Victor H. Mair, &quot;the monks cultivated tea, drank it for meditation, while studying, and during ceremonies, offered tea to the Buddha, presented it as a gift to visitors, sold it, and sent it as tribute to the imperial court, which in turn reciprocated.&quot; Buddhist tea culture (which was centered in Southern China) in turn popularized tea wherever Buddhist monasteries were built. &quot;A Record of Things Seen and Heard&quot; by Mr. Feng (c. 800) states that a Chan Buddhist master on Mount Tai promoted tea, and his monks carried it everywhere. Furthermore,

This habit was in turn imitated by others, and became a custom. From Zou, Qi, Cang and Di [places in Shandong, where Mount Tai is located, and neighboring Hebei province] it gradually spread to the capital. Many shops making and selling tea opened in the markets, and people, whether religious or lay, pay money to drink it. The tea arrives in a constant stream of boats and carts from Jiang and Huai [in the south], and is piled up in mountains, with many different types. In this way, a tea drinking culture, which was mainly centered in the south, was widely transmitted to the north through Buddhist channels. Famen Temple (Xi&#x27;an) was one important Buddhist monastery that was associated with tea culture. A cache of imperial grade teaware and tea tools were found in this temple. 

It was also during the Tang that Japanese Buddhist monks visited China and returned home with tea. The most famous figures who first introduced Chinese tea to Japan are Saichō (who stayed at Fulong Temple, Mount Tai.) and Kūkai (who stayed at Ximing Temple, Chang’an). The first recorded cultivation of tea in Japan was by Saichō, who planted some tea plants at Mt Hiei. Similarly, Buddhist monks also brought tea to Korea during this era and Korean tea history is closely connected to the history of Korean Buddhism and its links with Chinese Buddhist tea drinking communities. Korean histories like &quot;Samkuk-yusa&quot; and &quot;Samkuk-sagi&quot; also indicate that Korean royals were drinking tea by the 7th century, which was mostly sourced from China.

==== The &quot;Classic of Tea&quot; ====

&quot;The Classic of Tea&quot; (&quot;Chájīng,&quot; c. 760–762 CE) was a significant contribution to the evolution of tea culture during the Tang dynasty. An important work of literature by tea connoisseur Lu Yu, the book provides an extensive overview of Tang tea culture and industry. &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot; was the first monograph regarding the study of tea, which consisted of ten chapters ranging from the history of tea, its cultivation, and how to prepare, serve, and drink it. The book describes how tea plants were grown, the leaves processed, and how tea prepared as a beverage through grinding tea bricks into powder and whisking it in a bowl. The book also describes how tea was evaluated and where the best tea leaves were produced. Lu Yu also encouraged commoners to drink tea by including a section on what tea utensils could be omitted if one could not afford them. Lu Yu is known as the ‘Sage of Tea’ and the ‘God of Tea’ because of his profound influence on tea culture. 

The &quot;Classic of Tea&quot; mentions how during Lu Yu&#x27;s time, the whole plant was picked, including stems and branches and all leaves. This differs in how tea is picked in modern times (only a few leaves are picked at a time). After harvesting, tea was steamed, pounded in a mortar, placed in moulds and dried into tea cakes or bricks. The &quot;Classic of Tea&quot; method of preparing tea was by baking the tea cake over a fire, placing it in a paper sack to cool, grinding it up in a mortar, and boiling the tea in a cauldron with a pinch of salt. The tea would be served as an unfiltered thick soup, with all the leaves, stems and grounds in it. According to Lu Yu, the best tea bowls in his time was the celadon Yue ware from the Yue kilns of Zhejiang. He writes that tea should be taken in small sips. 

The &quot;Classic of Tea&quot; also tied drinking tea to spiritual matters, the arts, and philosophy. An important value that Lu Yu&#x27;s Classic emphasized was &quot;frugality&quot; (儉 jiǎn), a kind of rustic simplicity. The &quot;Classic&quot; soon became an appealing text for the Chinese elites. who soon embraced tea culture as an important and civilized element of Chinese culture. Thus, Lu Yu&#x27;s classic helped transform an enjoyable beverage into an art that became central to Chinese culture.

Lu Yu&#x27;s classic inspired and was followed by other works on tea culture. Some texts, like Zhang Youxin&#x27;s &quot;A Record of Water for Decocting Tea,&quot; focused on specific topics, like water for tea making. Zhang lists the twenty best water sources for tea, and he also writes &quot;if you make tea with water from the place where it is cultivated, it will invariably be excellent, because the water and the land are suited to each other. If you go away to another place, the water will contribute half, while skill in preparation and clean vessels will complete the effect.&quot;

=== Song dynasty (960–1279) ===

The tea culture flourished during the Song dynasty, where it was consumed by the elite during social gatherings where Chinese arts and poetry were appreciated and discussed. Detailed standards also emerged for judging the color, aroma, and taste of tea. Tea art, the tea gatherings, and tea houses continued to increase in popularity. Knowledge of proper tea making was considered a gentlemanly pursuit, along with other skills like calligraphy, painting, and poetry. 

China&#x27;s monopoly on tea allowed them to use it as a powerful economic and diplomatic tool. The Song established &quot;Tea and Horse Offices&quot; ( 茶马司) to oversee the trading of tea for horses along the Tea Horse Road with Tibet. They required large numbers of warhorses to fight battles with invading northern nomadic Liao, Jin, and Xixia. When disputes arose, the dynastic government would threaten to cut off the tea trade and close off the &#x27;Tea and Horse offices&#x27;. The traditional tea culture with the elite and scholars became more complex and tea culture continued to spread to the masses. Regional variations of tea culture formed throughout China. Different types of teahouses also emerged, including teahouses for music, for socializing and conversation, and for prostitution (which were called hua chafang, flower tea houses).&quot;&quot; 

Tea cultivation moved from wild tea plants to established farming across numerous provinces, leading to tea being traded worldwide. ‘Tribute tea’ was the gifting of high-quality tea to the emperor to honor him. The Song tea economy developed into a large monopolistic government bureaucracy that collected tea taxes, fixed tea prices, sold vouchers which allowed merchants to sell tea, managed tea cultivation on rural farms, and transported tribute tea to the royal court.&quot;&quot; 

The most expensive and finest tea in the Song was la cha (&quot;wax tea&quot;), which was made from the highest grade leaves which were washed, steamed, pressed, ground up, and roasted in moulds to make tea cakes or bricks. The cakes were often covered with different kinds of precious oils, spices and were sealed with aromatic oinments, like Borneo camphor, to create all sorts of highly fragrant teas which went by names like &quot;Dragon Brain Fragrant Tea&quot;. There were also many different types of popular teawares during the Song, including those made in the Five Great Kilns. Northern Celadon and southern Longquan celadon were the most popular types of celadon wares. Cizhou ware remained important, and other new types of white porcelain also became popular for teaware, like Ding ware and Qingbai ware.

Emperor Huizong of Song (reigned 1100–1126) was a great tea enthusiast. He wrote the &quot;Grand Treatise on Tea&quot; (大觀茶論), which is perhaps the second greatest work on tea in China after the &quot;Classic of Tea&quot;.&quot;&quot; Huizhong was a fan of unperfumed white tea that had not been covered in aromatics. His preferences influenced the elites and from this time on, perfumed teas became less popular. Tea literature was prolific at this time. Another important work was &quot;Record of Tea&quot; by Cai Xiang.&quot;&quot; The scholar-officials who oversaw the tea economy often wrote poetry on tea. One poem by Southern Song tea expert Xiong Fan reads, &quot;‘Throngs tussle, trampling new moss. I turn my head toward first blush over the dragon’s field. A warden beating a gong to urge haste, they carry baskets of tea down the mountain. When picking tea, one is not allowed to see the sunrise.’&quot;

Tea was also widely used in Buddhist temples and monasteries during Buddhist rituals as offerings to the Buddhas. There were even specific rituals which focused on tea, like the one described in the &quot;Pure Rules of Baizhang&quot; (&quot;Bǎizhàng qīngguī&quot;), which continues to be practiced in some Japanese Rinzai Zen temples today. In the 12th century, a Japanese Zen monk called Eisai (c. 1141–1215, Ch: Yosai) brought tea from China to Japan, planted it, and wrote the first Japanese book on tea (喫茶養生記, &quot;Treatise on Drinking Tea for Health&quot;) which drew on Lu Yu&#x27;s &quot;Classic&quot; and argued tea promoted longevity and spiritual harmony&quot;.&quot; Eisai also introduced rituals for offering tea to the Buddha and to the Shinto deities&quot;.&quot; This was the beginning of tea cultivation and tea culture in Japan.

Tea was also a major export good through the Silk Road on land and Maritime Silk Road. During this time, Persian and Arab encountered tea for the first time. Chinese tea culture is described by Al-Biruni (c. 11th century) in his &quot;Book on Pharmacy and Materia Medica.&quot; 

==== Song era tea making ====
Tea served during the Song was often made from tea bricks or cakes made of partially dried or thoroughly dried and ground tea leaves pressed into bricks (a process similar to modern Pu-erh). In the Song era, serving the tea from tea bricks or cakes required the following steps:&quot;&quot; 

* Water was boiled in a porcelain ewer (pitcher).
* &quot;Toasting&quot;: Tea bricks are usually first toasted over a fire to destroy any mould or insects that may have burrowed into the bricks during storage.
* &quot;Grinding&quot;: The tea brick was crushed in a bag (silk if one could afford it) and ground to a fine powder which was placed in a bowl
* &quot;Whisking&quot;: The powdered tea was mixed with hot water and beaten with a bamboo whisk called Chaxian (茶筅) or in Japan called Chasen before serving. 
This tea preparing method called Dian cha (點茶).
The froth, colour and patterns formed by the whisked tea were aesthetically important for the elites and whisking was considered a gentleman&#x27;s skill. The whisked frothy teas led to the rise in popularity of dark patterned bowls in which the texture of the thick whisked tea could be more easily judged, as the white froth contrasted more easily with dark bowls.&quot;&quot; 

The best of these bowls were the Jian ware made in the Jianzhou kilns, glazed in patterns with names like oil spot, partridge feather, hare&#x27;s fur, and tortoise shell.&quot;&quot; These styles are still highly valued today. The patterned holding bowl and tea mixture were often lauded in the period&#x27;s poetry, with phrases such as &quot;partridge in swirling clouds&quot; or &quot;snow on Hare&#x27;s fur.&quot; A popular pastime was to use various implements like spoons to create art on the tea froth which would depict things like birds, fish, flowers and plants.&quot;&quot; 

The Chinese practice of preparing powdered tea was brought to Japan by Buddhist monks and can still be seen in the Japanese tea ceremony, or &quot;Chadō&quot; which uses finely powdered matcha.&quot;&quot;

While cake tea (whether fancy or coarse cakes) was popular with many groups, including monks and elites, various other methods of tea making were also used by the commoners. Adding honey to tea was one popular tea making method. In the later Southern Song era (1127–1279) wax tea and whisked tea methods had become less popular among the commoners and loose-leaf green tea had become the most popular type of tea with commoners, since it was cheaper to make and easier to prepare.&quot;&quot; 

==== Tea competitions ====

Tea competitions developed among the people of Jianzhou in the Tang and became very popular in the Song.&quot;&quot; These competitions were usually focused on producing the thickest or most aesthetically pleasing tea broth or foam (tanghua) through whisking as well as on tea art and tea tasting.&quot;&quot; These games became known as &#x27;fighting tea&#x27; (doucha) or &#x27;tea war&#x27; (mingzhan). Soon the competitions were held at the imperial palace and among elites and scholars, where it became a refined form of entertainment, like modern wine tastings.&quot;&quot; Emperor Song Huizeng was a tea war enthusiast. The quality of tea, tools used, and the water condition were of great importance in winning a tea competition. 

Tea competitions involved the entire process of tea preparation, boiling water, grinding tea, tasting, etc. The battle might focus on creating a foam on the tea or on tasting the tea.&quot;&quot; According to Skill in tea arts became a sign of manly refinement for Song men. Displaying one&#x27;s manhood was important during this time, and tea fighting was one way for men to prove themselves. During the Tang and Song dynasties, showing elite manhood was tied to their refined values. It was associated with high cultural pursuits, so winning the tea competition allowed the winner to display their successful masculine image.

=== Ming era ===

In 1391, the Hongwu Emperor (1368–1398), the founder of the Ming dynasty, decreed that tributes of tea to the court were to be changed from the &quot;wax tea&quot; cake form to loose-leaf tea. The emperor&#x27;s explanation for the change found in his decree, called &quot;Abolishing Tea Cakes and Switching to Tribute Leaf Tea,&quot; was that wax tea cake making was &quot;overtaxing the people’s strength.&quot;&quot;&quot; The emperor had also grown up as a poor tenant farmer and had also spent some time as a Buddhist monk. He thus preferred the simpler and less time consuming way of making loose leaf teas than the more expensive and ostentatious whisked tea style, which was also much more difficult and expensive to process. His imperial decree quickly transformed the tea-drinking habits of the Chinese upper classes, who soon took to drinking loose leaf tea. Cake tea was further criticized by the emperor&#x27;s son, Zhu Quan, who was a connoisseur of tea. Zhu&#x27;s &quot;Tea Manual&quot; (茶谱, &quot;Chá Pǔ&quot;) argued that cake tea / wax tea ruined the true flavor of tea which could only be experienced by brewing pure tea leaf in its natural form. He also promoted a refined style of taking tea which required six pure elements: quiet hills, clear spring water, pure tea, relaxed heart, clean teaware and the company of virtuous people. 

Ming style loose leaf tea was also introduced to Japan in the 17th century by figures like the Chinese Buddhist monk Ingen (Ch: Yǐnyuán), the founder of the Ōbaku school of Zen. This tea tradition, popularized by later figures like Baisao, would evolve into the style now known as . 

==== New teaware ====
The arrival of the new method for preparing elite tea also required the adoption of new vessels and tools, such as:

* The tea pot or tea brewing bowl was needed so that the tea leaves could be steeped separately from the drinking vessel for an infusion of proper concentration.
* Tea caddies and containers also became necessary to preserve freshness, flavor and aroma.
* Smaller drinking cups or bowls, in lighter colors and often decorated with designs. These cups were better suited to the lighter color of the steeped tea liquor and aided in smelling the aroma of fresh tea.
* Smaller tools like spoons for tea leaves and strainers to keep leaves out of one&#x27;s cup when pouring tea.

Teawares made with a special kind of purple clay (zisha) from Yixing went on to develop during this period, now known as Yixing zisha teapots. Purple clay&#x27;s structure was porous and retained heat well. The porousness of the clay also meant that it would take on the taste of tea over time (a process known as &quot;seasoning&quot;), which would affect the taste of any tea brewed in the pot. Simplicity and rusticity dominated the idea of purple clay teawares which soon became quite popular. The first true teapot developed during the 16th century, when monks from the Jinsha Temple (Golden Sand Temple) near Yixing began making unglazed teapots from the local clay. Their use was popularized by Gong Chun, who became a servant in the house of Yixing tea master Wu Lun (1440–1522). 

New types of porcelain teawares also became popular during the Ming, such as Jingdezhen porcelain, which was popular in the imperial court and widely patronized by the emperor. The late Ming dynasty also saw a transition towards a market economy that exported porcelain worldwide at scale. During the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572–1620), the kilns at Jingdezhen became the main production centre for large-scale porcelain exports to Europe, many of which were teaware pieces or sets that were valued by the upper classes in Europe.

==== Tea literature ====
During the Ming, teaware and tea utensils became important luxury goods for the elites and upwardly mobile classes. There was also a thriving publishing industry writing books on the appropriate elite etiquette surrounding elegant and refined pursuits such as tea. One of the most of important of these works which discusses Ming era tea culture was &quot;Eight Discourses on the Art of Living&quot; (&quot;Zun Sheng Ba Jian&quot;) by Gao Lian (late 16th century)&quot;,&quot; a work that in turn heavily influenced the widely popular &quot;Treatise on Superfluous Things (Zhang wu zhi)&quot; of Wen Zhenheng (1585–1645)&quot;.&quot; Another one of these works, the &quot;Treatise on Tea&quot; (茶疏 &quot;Chashu&quot;) by Xu Cishui 許次紓 (1597), explains how loose leaf tea was brewed in the Ming era:The teapot should be small; it should not be too big. If it is small, the fragrance remains concentrated; if it is big, it will easily get dispersed. One containing half a sheng [half litre, 500ml] is of the appropriate size. If it is for personal use, the smaller the better. For a half sheng of water, measure five fen [a little under 2 grams] of tea...First hold the tea leaves in your hand. When the water is ready, cast them in the pot, and immediately pour the hot water on the tea. Place the lid on the pot and wait for the time of three breaths. Then pour out all the tea into a large bowl, and pour it again into the pot. This is to stir the fragrance and to prevent the colour from stagnating. Wait for the time of another three breaths to calm its levity. Then pour it out and serve it to the guests...A pot of tea can serve only two rounds (xun). The first round is fresh and delicious, the second is sweet and mellow, the third one is no more desirable. For this reason it is desirable that the pot is small. If it is small it will finish serving two rounds. The Ming elite drank tea in a more subdued fashion than their Song counterparts. They preferred peace and quietude in the countryside. Drinking tea was something for small gatherings or a solitary pursuit. This aesthetic is captured in the works of famous Ming artists like the painter Tang Yin and the writer and tea master Lu Shusheng. 

==== Developments in tea processing ====

One new development of tea processing during the Ming was discovered by Buddhist monks on Anhui&#x27;s Songluo Mountain, who began to roast tea leaves in a dry wok fueled by charcoal to stop the oxidation process (a process called fixing). Before this invention, tea leaves were &quot;fixed&quot; by being steamed. The monks preferred the fragrance and flavor of this lightly roasted tea and soon this method became popular. The practice, named &quot;Songluo method&quot;, was described in Wen Long&#x27;s &quot;Tea Commentary&quot; (c. 1630). &quot;Songluo tea&quot; is still used today as a name for traditionally made charcoal roasted teas. 

In the 16th century, monks from Songluo were brought to the Wuyi Mountains in Fujian to teach their new method to Wuyi tea makers. Over the following decades, the monks at Wuyi learned that leaving leaves to wither in the sun and slightly bruising them through pressing and tossing them made the leaves brown, changing their flavor and fragrance. This new type of Wuyi tea was called oolong (&quot;black dragon&quot;) tea, the most famous of which were the Four Great Tea Cultivars. In northern Guangdong, this new type of tea was brewed in high amounts in small pots and served in small cups, an innovation that began in Chaozhou. This way of brewing tea is the ancestor of the modern gongfu tea method. 

It was this southern type of oxidized oolong tea that Europeans first encountered when they traded with the Chinese in Guangzhou (&quot;Canton&quot;). As European markets demanded more of it, Chinese tea makers continued to produce tea that was more and more oxidized, a process that culminated in the development of black tea (&quot;red tea&quot; in China). Other types of teas also became popular during this time, like white tea and yellow tea. 

Another development during the Ming was the discovery of fermented tea (dark tea). The discovery of tea fermentation was initially an accident produced by the length of time it took to transport tea to Tibet through the Tea Horse road. The Tibetans grew accustomed to this type of aged tea, which they eventually came to prefer due to its strong taste that paired well with butter and milk. In the early 16th century, this process was mastered by the tea-makers of Anhua county, Hunan. They discovered how to replicate this fermentation by piling leaves together in a hot and humid room for some time, which led to the growth of microorganisms. This type of tea was initially only processed to sell to Tibetans and northern nomadic tribes. 

=== Tea in the Qing Dynasty ===

The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) saw the rise in popularity of many different types of tea. By the mid-18th century, new forms of tea, including white, black and oolongs were well known and were being sold internationally, having become major cash crop for China. Evidence for Many of the famous modern styles of tea also began to be produced during the Qing and exported. For example, White Silver Needle, White Peony tea and Biluochun (Green Snail Spring) date to the Qing. 18th century Wuyi mountain oolongs can be found in sources like &quot;Recipes from the Garden of Contentment&quot; by the famous gastronome Yuan Mei (1716–1797) who also described the local tea customs. Apart from promoted milk tea (a traditional Manchu drink), the Qing court also popularized scented teas, such as jasmine tea and teas scented with cloranthus, cassia, honeysuckle, and rose. 

There were many types of teahouses (chaguan) in Beijing and other Chinese cities of the Qing empire, including large boisterous teahouses (dachaguan), teahouses which also served food and alcohol (erhunpu), teahouses only for tea and held tea appreciation parties (chaniaohui), teahouses for chess playing (qichaguan), scenic countryside teahouses (yechaguan), and teahouses where storytellers would recount Chinese classics like &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (shuchaguan). 

During the 19th century, Chinese tea and teawares were major commodities exported by the Qing around the world. Their popularity exploded in European nations, especially in Great Britain and Russia, who developed their own distinct tea cultures under the influence of Chinese tea. This made many Chinese elites rich, but had unforeseen consequences. Initially, the trade between China and the British Empire during the Qing era favored the Chinese. Tea, and Chinese porcelains (especially teaware) were in high in demand for the British (along with Chinese silks), but the Chinese did not find British goods desirable and would only accept silver in payment for their goods. This created a trade imbalance for the British. 

To reverse this situation, the British began smuggling opium into China, where they only accepted payments in silver as well. This created an endless cycle as Chinese citizens became addicted to opium, and the silver earned from opium sales would be used in turn by the British to pay for valuable Chinese goods, especially tea. The Qing state attempted to crack down on opium sales and this eventually led to the Opium Wars (1839 to 1842 and 1856 to 1860). Britain was victorious, and this allowed them to gain trading rights within China&#x27;s borders as well as other concessions.

=== 20th century ===

During the late 19th century, the British Empire and the East India Company succeeded in growing and processing tea in the Indian regions of Darjeeling and Assam. They relied on an Indian strain of tea as well as Chinese tea specimens and seeds clandestinely extracted from China by the efforts of the Scottish botanist Robert Fortune. Several Chinese tea growers and processors were also paid to aid in this venture. This revolution in the global tea trade meant that Qing China lost its monopoly on tea as the crop began to be produced worldwide. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, big western brands like Lyons, Liptons and Mazawattee dominated the western tea market. As such, by the beginning of the 20th century, Chinese tea was no longer the cash crop it had once been for the Qing empire.

Taiwanese tea production developed extensively throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, and Taiwanese tea began to be exported internationally. Taiwan remained a small tea producer in the 19th century which focused on oolongs like Dong Ding tea. During the Japanese occupation, the Yuchi Black Tea Research Institute focused on hybridizing commercial tea varieties with Taiwan&#x27;s indigenous varieties. The tea industry continued to expand into the late 20th century. After the Chinese Civil War, more Chinese migrated to Taiwan, bringing more Chinese tea culture and knowledge with them. Today, the Taiwan tea industry remains an important source of unique Chinese teas. 

Under Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong&#x27;s rule (1949–1976), China was mostly isolated from global markets. In the 1960s, under Mao&#x27;s leadership, during the period known as the Great Leap Forward, tea production was significantly limited, and tea houses and shops were for the most part closed. The Cultural Revolution was also a period in which China&#x27;s tea culture suffered. Under the leadership of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and his Chinese economic reform, China experienced double-digit economic growth and an era of increased personal freedoms, which spurred a rebirth of the tea industry and the traditional aspect of tea culture. According to Gary Sigley: &quot;a sense of self and nation has coalesced around tea.&quot; China is once again the leading producer of tea in the world. 

==== Development of the gongfucha tradition ====
During the 20th century, the modern gongfu style of tea drinking (sometimes called &quot;the&quot; &quot;Chinese tea ceremony&quot;) exploded in popularity, becoming a common practice throughout the Sinophone world and beyond. The practice of making tea in small covered cups or pots, using many repeated infusions and drinking in small teacups was a local practice which developed during the 19th century in southern Chinese provinces like Fujian (in the Wuyi mountains region) and Guandong (Chaozhou area). 

This method is described in Yuan Mei&#x27;s &quot;Recipes from the Garden of Contentment,&quot; though it is clear that he sees it as a surprising new development which was unknown in north China. Northern Chinese during this time mostly drank tea made in large teapots or pots using large cups or glasses. These larger teawares resemble those which were exported to Europe (as Chinese export porcelain) and became widely imitated as western chinoiserie teawares. One of the first explanations and usage of the term gongfucha is found in an essay by Yu Jiao (1751–?), who served as a low ranking official in Guangdong and observed the practice. 
Modern Chinese tea pioneers, most of whom practiced their art in Taiwan, took this early southern &quot;gongfu&quot; custom of tea drinking as well as influences from the Japanese &quot;senchadō&quot; (&quot;the way of steamed tea&quot;), and developed it into the modern gongfucha / chadao culture that could compete with Japanese tea culture. This new &quot;Chinese tea arts culture&quot; (zhonghua chayi wenhua) was initially termed &quot;chayi&quot; (&quot;tea arts&quot;) and was practiced in &quot;chayiguan&quot; (&quot;tea art houses&quot;) which initially appeared in 1970s Taiwan and attempted to provide a cultured, traditional, and quiet setting specifically for tea drinking (as opposed to the older &quot;teahouses&quot; often associated with the lower classes, gambling, smoking, and prostitution). 

Lawrence Zhang writes that Taiwanese tea house owners, conscious of themselves as pioneers in a new movement, claimed they &quot;were recovering a lost tradition by means of emphasizing the pureness of tea drinking as an activity&quot;. Since earlier Chinese tea culture had mostly been utilitarian, these Taiwan based pioneers in tea culture sought to create an aesthetically refined Chinese tradition which could rival the Japanese &quot;chadō&quot; as an art form. In this, they borrowed from Japanese tea arts. According to Zhang, key parallels to senchadō in Chinese chayi include &quot;the newfound interest in the spatial arrangement of teaware&quot; (seen in the modern concept of the aesthetically pleasing chaxi, &quot;tea setting&quot;) as well as the new emphasis on &quot;control of the movement of the physical body in relation to these wares&quot; (which became formalized into rules for how the tea brewer should move while making tea). Taiwanese tea scholars like Cai Rongzhang and Fan Zengping also began to write books on the art of tea. Influenced by the Japanese tradition which emphasized the aesthetics of harmony (wa), respect (kei), purity (sei), and tranquility (jaku), these authors emphasized what they considered to be the basic elements of tea culture, including beauty (mei), health (jian), cultivation (xing), and ethics (lun) for Cai; and harmony (he), thrift (jian), silence (jing), and cleanliness (jie) for Fan. 

Taiwan also used &quot;chayi&quot; culture to position itself as the legitimate representative of Chinese culture and tradition. As such, the influences of Japanese tea culture on chayi were mostly hidden. Chinese authors on tea well into the modern era continued to present gongfucha style as being an ancient tradition instead of a newly invented one. 

After the 1980s, this newly invented &quot;Chinese tea art&quot; (Zhonghua chayi) tradition was adopted throughout mainland China as a new national custom by a new class of wealthy urbanites seeking authentic Chinese culture. During this time, the Taiwanese Ten Ren Tea group entered the mainland Chinese market and became one of the most important players in China&#x27;s tea market, promoting gongfucha throughout the mainland.

=== 21st century ===
Contemporary China and Taiwan currently offer various ways to experience cultural tea tourism, such as museums, tea trails, guided tours, tea houses, tea shops, tea markets, and tea tastings. There is one tea museum in mainland China and another in Taiwan. The National Tea Museum on the mainland can be found in Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, which maintains a variety of Chinese tea culture exhibits.

A revitalization of the traditional tea house throughout China has been spurred on by the introduction of new designer tea houses that cater to the young urban population. Chinese tea culture is now also being exported to western nations, with popular brands selling high end Chinese tea and gongfu teaware.

== Preparation and consumption ==
The different ways of brewing Chinese tea depend on variables like the formality of the occasion, the means of the people preparing it, the local and regional culture, personal preference, and the kind of tea being brewed. For example, green teas are more delicate than oolong teas or black teas; therefore, green tea should be brewed with cooler water to avoid bitterness. 

The simplest and most informal method of brewing and drinking tea is to add the leaves to a bowl or cup containing hot water. One drinks directly from the very cup used for brewing, without straining or removing the leaves. Most of the leaves will often sink down to the bottom of the bowl and the rest can be avoided, eaten, drunk or pushed away. This method of drinking tea is very common in China and is commonly found in informal settings, households, workplaces and restaurants. 

Another method for making tea is to use a small lidded cup called a gaiwan or a small ceramic teapot (100 to 150 ml) for brewing. This is one of the most common types of teaware used in the modern gongfu cha style (&quot;making tea with skill&quot;) in which the tea (brewed with a large leaf to water ratio, like 5 grams per 100ml of water) is poured out into tiny cups. This style of tea making generally reserved for more formal situations and cultured venues, like art teahouses (&quot;chayiguan&quot;) and it is practiced by Chinese tea enthusiasts. The gaiwan can also serve as a teacup, and some Chinese will also drink tea directly from the gaiwan, using the lid to push aside floating leaves. In the Ming era, gaiwans were originally used as a teacup in this way. 

Yet another method is to brew tea in much larger teapot with much lower amount of leaf, in a manner similar to western tea brewing which generally uses larger pots and less tea leaf. This was also the common way to make tea in north China during the Qing dynasty. This style of brewing is still common in some regions, though it may not considered as cultured or refined as the gongfu cha method. Large pot tea brewing is common in Hong Kong, where a type of milk tea called pantyhose milk tea (simat naaicha) made with CTC tea, sugar and evaporated milk is popular. 

In contemporary China, tea bags and bottled tea have become more widespread. 

=== Chinese tea ceremony ===



The Chinese tea ceremony (which may be called chadao 茶道, &quot;the way of tea&quot;) is a typical Chinese activity involving the formal preparation and presentation of tea. It has held great cultural significance in China for over a thousand years. The important role of ceremony in Chinese culture is exemplified by the claim of the authors of &quot;Tea and Tea drinking: China&#x27;s outstanding contribution to the mankind&quot; that, “The word ‘ceremony’ (Li, 礼) is the basis or gene of Chinese culture and the first syllable of Chinese civilization, as it says ‘Of all things, courtesy comes first’ (万事礼为先).&quot; The Chinese tea ceremony grew in popularity in the Tang dynasty, reaching its peak in the Song dynasty.

&quot;Gongfu cha&quot;, meaning &quot;making tea with skill&quot;, is the most popular method of tea ceremony in China. It makes use of small teapots or vessels holding about 100–150 ml (4 or 5 fl.oz.), the size being thought to enhance the aesthetics and to &quot;round out&quot; the taste of the tea being brewed. Common types of tea brewing vessels include Yixing teapots, Jingdezhen porcelain and gaiwans. Small tea cups are being used along with Yixing teapots. Gongfu tea is best consumed after meal to help digestion. Brewing tea in a Yixing teapot can be done for private enjoyment as well as to welcome guests. Depending on the region of China, there may be differences in the steps of brewing as well as the tools used in the process. For example, Taiwanese-style &quot;gongfu cha&quot; makes use of several additional instruments including tweezers, a smelling cup and a tea strainer. 

The basic steps of a tea ceremony include: prepare tea, offer or serve tea, appreciate tea, sniff tea, savor and drink, and taste tea. Fine tea is required in both the formal tea ceremony and the tea competition. The Chinese tea ceremony is grounded on high-quality tea that &quot;embodies the soul of the mountains and rivers, the essence of heaven and earth, and the loving care of man.&quot; The second essential element is high-quality water. The highest quality water is ‘Tiashui’, rain or snow water collected in bamboo tubes or crocks, with natural spring water coming in second. Lu Yu set 20 different levels of water quality. 

The next important part of fine tea is an aesthetically pleasing tea service allowing for the fragrance of the tea to be appreciated. The &quot;Book of Tea&quot; described 24 different tea tools and methods of preparing tea. 

Where the tea is taken is also a part of the fine tea experience. Tea is considered special if served on hills with mist or cool breezes and in the moonlight. According to Liu Tong: “The Chinese emphasize the harmony between humans and nature in tea drinking.” During the Ming dynasty, there were specific rules surrounding when, where, and what environment was appropriate for the drinking of tea. A person should be relaxed and not too busy when taking tea. He should be in a peaceful setting, such as a courtyard, bridge, the forest, or a pavilion with lotus in the background. The weather should also be nice, rainy, or in moderate sunshine. Tea should be taken in a peaceful, tranquil setting, not a tense, noisy one. Tea should be experienced with only a few people at a time. As Cai Xiang states in his book, &quot;Record of Tea&quot; (1051), &quot;The fewer guests when drinking tea, the better. A crowd of guests is noisy, and noise detracts from the elegance of the occasion. Drinking tea alone is serenity, with two guests is superior, with three or four is interesting, with five or six is extensive, and with seven or eight is an imposition.&quot;

The tea ceremony is a tradition that exemplifies Chinese culture that has spread throughout the world, including in Japan, Korea, and Great Britain.

== The arts and tea ==
During the Tang and Song dynasties, literati produced poetry, calligraphy, and paintings to show their cultivated minds and express themselves. They became enthusiastic tea drinkers as they worked on their art. &quot;Talented drinkers also raised the general tone of tea drinking by associating it with other refined pursuits such as art, music, and literature.&quot; Lu Yu, the author of &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot;, was also an accomplished poet and calligrapher. Following is an excerpt of a famous tea poem written in the 8th century CE when tea art and literature were just emerging.The first bowl sleekly moistened throat and lips;

The second banished all my loneliness;

The third expelled the dullness from my mind,

Sharpening inspiration gained from all the books I&#x27;ve read.

The fourth brought forth light perspiration,

Dispersing a lifetime&#x27;s troubles through my pores.

The fifth bowl cleansed ev&#x27;ry atom of my being.

The sixth has made me kin to the Immortals.

The seventh is the utmost I can drinkThis poem was a thank you note from Yu espousing the virtues of tea after receiving it as a gift. Giving gifts of tea was a common practice at this time and usually was reciprocated with a note and high-quality tea given in return. Often artists would send a poem along with the gift of tea, and the recipient would send another poem with a return gift of tea. From the gifts the term &#x27;benevolent tea&#x27;() was coined.

Writing poetry was extremely popular during the Tang and Song dynasties and was considered a requirement to be among this group of scholarly men. According to Hinsch, &quot;... readers today can still enjoy more than forty-eight thousand surviving poems written by two thousand poets from the Tang dynasty alone... Song writers continued to use tea as a stock poetic theme, and some of the greatest literary figures of that era, such as Su Shi, wrote enthusiastically and repeatedly about tea.&quot;

Calligraphy is another art form that was very popular among the artisans of the Tang and Song, in which they integrated tea culture. Some of the calligraphy considered masterpieces of this era are centered around tea. For example, a casual note from Su Shi to a friend inviting him to tea housed at the National Palace Museum in Beijing, is considered an artistic treasure because of its beauty.

==Tea drinking customs==
Tea customs vary among different groups of people, regions, lifestyles, and religions. &quot;Chinese tea arts include Confucianism tea, Taoism tea, Buddhism tea, and vulgar tea (俗茶) &#x27;tea of the public&#x27;, which conform to the corresponding religious morals and behavior standards.&quot; Drinking tea for the Taoists represents how the body and soul are regarded as one and improving oneself through self-cultivation; tea helps the Buddhist understand the meaning of Zen; while the Confucians believe tea and drinking tea are used for hospitality representing their humanistic views.

China&#x27;s national minority cultures have their own tea customs. In the words of Li Xiousong, &quot;The Tibetans put tea before food.&quot; A gift of brick tea is considered the most valuable gift. They give butter tea to the most distinguished guests, salt tea to regular guests, and plain tea to people of Han nationality. Mongolian herdsmen drink milk tea. When a guest visits, they are invited in and presented with a cup of tea from the host, prepared by the hostess. Not accepting the tea would be considered extremely rude and offensive.

There are several special circumstances in which tea is prepared and consumed in Chinese culture, and is preserved completely in mainland China and Taiwan.

=== The Justice Cup ===
Chahai tea utensils, also known as Gong Dao Bei or &quot;Cup of Equality,&quot; are a key tool for tea connoisseurs. It is used to ensure that each glass is filled equally, regardless of the material (glass, porcelain or clay) from which it is made.

The history of Chahai is closely linked to Chinese tea culture. With the growing popularity of tea ceremonies, it became important to provide the same amount of the drink for each guest. Chahai, also known as the &quot;Cup of Equality,&quot; was created as a response to this challenge.

=== A sign of hospitality ===
Hospitality is important in Chinese culture, and offering tea to a guest is considered customary practice. A guest is expected to accept the tea and take at least a sip as a sign of appreciation.

=== A sign of respect ===
According to Chinese tradition, members of the younger generation should show their respect to members of the older generation by offering a cup of tea. Inviting their elders to restaurants for tea is a traditional holiday activity. Newly married couples serve tea to their elder family members. In the past, people of a lower social class served tea to the upper class in society. Today, with the increasing liberalization of Chinese society, this rule and its connotations have become blurred.

=== To apologize ===
In Chinese culture, tea may be offered as part of a formal apology. For example, children who have misbehaved may serve tea to their parents as a sign of regret and submission.

=== To show gratitude and celebrate weddings ===
In the traditional Chinese marriage ceremony, the bride and groom kneel in front of their respective parents, as well as elderly relatives such as grand parents and serve them tea and then thank them, together which represents an expression of their gratitude and respect. According to the tradition, the bride and groom serve both families. This process symbolizes the joining of the two families.

=== Tea drinking style ===

==== Tang dynasty boiling tea method ====
The tea was cooked directly in the kettle. This was the most common tea method in China&#x27;s Tang dynasty. Before boiling the tea, crush the tea leaves, boil the water, and put in the seasoning, then sprinkle the tea powder into the pot. When drinking, the tea dregs and tea soup together while hot, called &quot;eat tea&quot;. Tang people cooking tea once like to add seasoning to the tea soup, such as salt, onion, ginger or orange peel, and so on.

==== Song dynasty point tea method ====
This method of drinking tea was used in the Song dynasty, and tea people ate from this method. Song dynasty tea drinking method rose to the height of aesthetics and reached the ultimate. They decorated the tea cake with many dragon and phoenix patterns, very delicate, called &quot;dragon and phoenix group tea&quot;. When drinking tea, first, the cake tea is crushed into a fine powder, with boiling water, to brew some tea. To make the tea powder and water into one, with a tea brush quickly hit, the tea and water fully mingle and make a lot of white tea froth. This is where the Japanese matcha ceremony originated.

==== Ming dynasty tea brewing method ====
By the Ming dynasty, the tea-making and drinking method was simplified again and again. Zhu Yuanzhang vigorously promoted loose tea, which led to tea alienation, before only green tea, and then slowly appeared other tea types. The tea brewing method continues today, brewing tea without any seasoning, drinking the original taste of tea, the authentic flavor, while the tea tools and techniques used to brew tea also simplified a lot, more conducive to the spread of tea culture.

=== Finger tapping ===
Light finger tapping is an informal way to thank the tea master or tea server for tea. While or after one&#x27;s cup is filled, the receiver of the tea may tap the index and middle fingers (one or more in combination) to express gratitude to the person who served the tea. This custom is common in southern China, where meals are often accompanied by many servings of tea.

This custom is said to have originated in the Qing dynasty when the Qianlong Emperor traveled in disguise throughout the empire and his accompanying servants were instructed not to reveal their master&#x27;s identity. One day in a restaurant in southern China, the emperor poured tea for a servant. To that servant it was a huge honor to have the emperor pour him a cup of tea. Out of habit, he wanted to kneel and bow to express his thanks to the emperor, however he could not do this since that would reveal the emperor&#x27;s identity. Instead, he tapped the table with bent fingers to represent kneeling to the Emperor and to express his gratitude and respect. In this sense, the bent fingers supposedly signify a bowing servant.

In formal tea ceremonies nodding the head or saying &quot;thank you&quot; is more appropriate.

== Tea growing and processing ==
Another important element of Chinese tea culture are the methods used to grow and process tea.

=== Roasting and brewing ===

Steaming tea leaves was the primary process used for centuries in the preparation of tea. After the transition from compressed tea, the production of tea for trade and distribution changed once again. The Chinese learned to process tea in a different way in the mid-13th century. Back in the Tang Dynasty, tea was commonly prepared by bringing water to a boil and taking a cup of water out from the pot. Afterwards, the water would be stirred and tea powder would be poured into the swirling water. Finally, the water which was scooped out earlier was then poured back in which prevented the tea from over-boiling.

=== Fermentation ===
After cutting, tea is subjected to a so-called &quot;fermentation.&quot; This process is not actually a fermentation, which is an anaerobic process, but rather an enzymatic oxidization of the polyphenols in the tea leaves, yielding theaflavins and thearubigins. When the tea leaves are dry, fermentation stops, allowing some control of the process by manipulation of the drying rate or adding water after drying. Fermentation can also be interrupted by heat, for example by steaming or dry-panning the tea leaves through a technique known as &quot;shāqīng&quot; (殺青). In 17th century China numerous advances were made in tea production. In the southern part of China, tea leaves were sun dried and then half fermented, producing Oolong or &quot;black dragon tea.&quot; However, this method was not common in the rest of China. Tea was used for medical purposes, and salt was often added to alter its bitter taste.

==Influence on Chinese culture==
The culture of tea has been an essential part of self-cultivation since roughly the Tang dynasty, especially associated with Chinese Chan Buddhism (in Japan Zen).

===Teaware===
Different teawares can affect people&#x27;s expectations of tea. First of all, different teaware will affect how people feel about drinking tea. When tea is drunk with a tea set that looks ornamental, people&#x27;s mood will become pleasant; when the teaware is not so ornamental, people&#x27;s pleasure in drinking tea will be reduced. Secondly, the visual effect of the teaware affects people&#x27;s expectations of the bitterness of the tea. The better the teaware, the more bitter people will think the tea is, and the more bitter the tea is, the better the tea is. So the teaware also influences people&#x27;s judgment of the value of tea when no price information was provided. The practice of drinking tea was considered to be an expression of personal morality, education, social principles, and status. The price of tea ware varies depending on the material and quality of it. A set of jade tea ware can cost hundreds of thousands dollars whereas a set of low quality tea ware may only cost less than a hundred dollars. Increased enthusiasm for tea drinking led to the greater production of teaware.

===Teahouse===
Ancient Chinese scholars used the teahouse as a place for sharing ideas. The teahouse was where political allegiances and social rank were said to have been temporarily suspended in favor of honest and rational discourse. It is a paradise for tea lovers, but also a place for people to rest, recreation and socialization. Likewise, the teahouse is a microcosm or window of society, Chinese teahouse has a long history, as early as the Tang Emperor Xuanzong period, only then not called the teahouse called &quot;tea store&quot;. The leisurely consumption of tea promoted conviviality and civility among the participants. The teahouse is not only a minor by-product of Chinese tea culture; it offers historical evidence of Chinese tea history. Today, people can also sense a humanistic atmosphere in Beijing&#x27;s Lao She Teahouse and other East China cities like Hangzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Wuxi, Shaoxing, Shanghai, and other places. The teahouse atmosphere is still dynamic and vigorous.

=== Spirituality and religion ===

Chinese tea culture holds a significant place not only as a social and cultural activity but also within Chinese spirituality and religion. The interplay between tea culture and Chinese religion is profound, influencing the practices, and worldviews of the various Chinese religions. A modern Chinese article on tea states &quot;It is believed that a tea-drinking process is a spiritual enjoyment, an art, a means of cultivating the moral character, and nourishing the mind.&quot; The modern Chinese tea ceremony may be seen to have spiritual components by some contemporary practitioners, depending on their worldview. Chinese tea culture may be associated with values like harmony, propriety, peace, happiness, simplicity, and physical cultivation.

Tea has played a crucial role in Buddhist monastic life, especially within Chan (Zen) Buddhism. The preparation and drinking of tea helped Buddhist monks in staying awake and focused during long hours of meditation. The simplicity and naturalness of drinking tea resonated with Buddhist values of simplicity and mindfulness and tea drinking was often an occasion for religious and philosophical discussion. As such, Buddhist monasteries became centers for tea cultivation and production. The exchange of tea among monasteries and lay followers facilitated a sense of community and mutual support, and allowed monasteries to raise funds. Tea is also used as a ceremonial offering to the Buddhas and is often placed on Buddhist altars. 

In Confucian thought, tea drinking became associated with social rituals and the cultivation of social harmony. The tea ceremony is seen to reflect the Confucian ideals of propriety (li) and respect in social interactions. The act of preparing and serving tea, especially for one&#x27;s family, is also seen as a means of self-cultivation, promoting Confucian virtues such as respect, filial piety, and humility. Furthermore, Confucian scholars often used tea gatherings as a way to discuss Confucian philosophy.

Daoists often sees tea as an important drink for promoting health since they believe that tea aids in the cultivation and balancing of qi (breath energy, vital energy). The energy or spirit of tea (cha qi) is seen as being able to harmonize the body and mind, promoting health and longevity as well as aiding one in attaining spiritual enlightenment. In Daoist practice, the preparation and consumption of tea may even be seen as part of Chinese alchemy.

===Modern culture===
In modern China, virtually every dwelling has a set of tea implements for brewing a cup of hot tea. They are symbols of welcome for visitors or neighbors. Traditionally, a visitor to a Chinese home is expected to sit down and drink tea while talking; visiting while remaining standing is considered uncouth. Folding the napkin in tea ceremonies is a traditional act in China performed to keep away bad qi energy. In Taiwan, tea ceremonies are held not only in daily life but also on important occasions.

Tea was regarded as one of the seven daily necessities, the others being firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar. There are many different types of tea such as: green tea, oolong tea, red tea, black tea, white tea, yellow tea, puerh tea and flower tea. Traditionally, fresh tea leaves are regularly turned over in a deep bowl. This process allows the leaves dry in a way that preserves their full flavor, ready for use.

<text>Utu is a 1983 New Zealand war film about the New Zealand Wars. Co-written and directed by Geoff Murphy, the films stars Anzac Wallace, Bruno Lawrence, Tim Eliott, Ilona Rodgers, Wi Kuki Kaa and Merata Mita, and depicts the story of a Māori warrior who sets out on a quest for &quot;utu&quot; (revenge). Inspired by the events of Te Kooti&#x27;s War, the film is set in 1870 in the North Island and has been described as a New Zealand Western.

The film, which had one of the largest budgets for a New Zealand film when it was produced, screened out of competition at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, and became the second most successful locally-made movie released in New Zealand after being released in theatres. Positive reviews of the film from American critics, include a rave view from Pauline Kael, helped to gain Murphy directing opportunities in Hollywood. In 2013, partially thanks to the longtime existence of an alternative cut of the film aimed at international audiences which Murphy had never been happy with, he completed work on a restored and recut version. Titled &quot;Utu Redux&quot;, the recut version, premiered at a film festival in Wellington on 26 July 2013.

==Plot==

In 1870, Te Wheke (Anzac Wallace) is a Māori warrior who collaborates with the colony of New Zealand during the New Zealand Wars. When he comes across a village destroyed by colonial forces, Te Wheke recognises it as his birthplace and deserts the colonialists to wage an insurgency against them instead. After Te Wheke destroys the home of colonial officer Williamson (Bruno Lawrence) and kills his wife Emily, Williamson vows to hunt down Te Wheke and kill him personally. Concomitantly, Māori scout Wiremu (Wi Kuki Kaa) and veteran officer Lieutenant Scott (Kelly Johnson) also attempt to track Te Wheke down, using insurgency weapons and tactics despite the personal disapproval of their superior, Colonel Elliot (Tim Eliott).

==Cast==
* Anzac Wallace as Te Wheke
* Bruno Lawrence as Williamson
* Tim Eliott as Colonel Elliot
* Kelly Johnson as Lieutenant Scott
* Wi Kuki Kaa as Wiremu
* Tania Bristowe as Kura
* Ilona Rodgers as Emily Williamson
* Merata Mita as Matu
* Faenza Reuben as Hersare
* Tama Poata as Puni
* Martyn Sanderson as Vicar
* John Bach as Belcher
* Dick Puanaki as Eru
* Sean Duffy as Corporal Jones
* Ian Watkin as Doorman
* Betty MacKay as Organist

==Production==

&quot;Utu&quot; was one of the largest film productions to have taken place in New Zealand until that point. Its grand scale warranted the use of a large second unit, which again was rare in the context of a young New Zealand cinema industry. Wallace prior to being cast as Te Wheke had some experience acting on television.

Murphy was interested in authenticity, trying to keep it as period-accurate as possible. To accomplish this many of the extras were local Maori and in order for Te Wheke&#x27;s moko to look realistic, Anzac Wallace would spend 4 hours having it applied each day of shooting.

==Reception==

The film&#x27;s immediate reception was less positive than Murphy&#x27;s earlier works, although still positive. Locally the film was very commercially successful, being New Zealand&#x27;s second highest-grossing film at the time (behind Murphy&#x27;s previous effort, &quot;Goodbye Pork Pie&quot;).

Critically the film had a mixed positive reception. Filmmaker Costa Botes noted that “&quot;Utu&quot;&#x27;s shotgun approach to the great New Zealand film ultimately leaves it feeling episodic and tangled&quot;. &quot;New Yorker&quot; film critic Pauline Kael however gave the film an exceptionally positive review, saying that &quot;[Geoff Murphy] seems to be directing with a grin on his face, [...] the ferocity of these skirmishes and raids is played off against an Arcadian beauty that makes your head swim&quot;. Similarly &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;Murphy has produced powerful images and strong performances&quot;.

The film prompted public discussion about New Zealand history. Film academic Roger Horrocks said &quot;Utu was an uneven film but succeeded in stirring up more discussion of New Zealand history than any recent book has done&quot;.

Quentin Tarantino in a 2016 interview with Radio New Zealand praised &quot;Utu&quot; as &quot;hands down the best New Zealand movie of all time&quot;.

<text>Mong Kok (also spelled Mongkok, often abbreviated as MK) is an area in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Prince Edward subarea occupies the northern part of Mong Kok.

Mong Kok is one of the major shopping areas in Hong Kong. The area is characterised by a mixture of old and new multi-story buildings, with shops and restaurants at street level, and commercial or residential units above. Major industries in Mong Kok are retail, restaurants (including fast food) and entertainment. It has been described and portrayed in films as an area in which triads run bars, nightclubs, and massage parlours. With its extremely high population density of , Mong Kok was described as the busiest district in the world by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;.

==Name==
Until 1930, the area was called Mong Kok Tsui (). The current English name is a transliteration of its older Chinese name (; ), or (; ), which is named for its plentiful supply of ferns in the past when it was a coastal region. Its present Chinese name, &quot;&quot; (; ), means &quot;prosperous corner&quot; or &quot;crowded corner&quot;; however, the English name did not change.

For a period, the area was also called Argyle, and this name was used for the MTR station when it opened in 1979. The office building , which was named after the area, is known in English as Argyle Centre.

==Administration==
Mong Kok is part of Yau Tsim Mong District. It was part of the Mong Kok District before the district was merged in 1994. The area belongs to the Kowloon West geographical constituency of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong.

==History==
Displays at the Chinese University of Hong Kong include antique potteries indicating that there might have been settlements in the area as early as the western Han dynasty (206 BC to AD 8 ) to Jin Dynasty (266–420).

The area used to be a Hakka settlement, with about 200 villagers according to Bao&#x27;an records in 1819.

The heart of the present-day Mong Kok is along Argyle Street near Sai Yeung Choi Street whilst the proper Mong Kok used to be to the north, near the present-day Mong Kok East station. Mong Kok was an area of cultivated lands, bounded to the south by Argyle Street, to the west by Coronation Road (a section of present-day Nathan Road), and to the east by hills. To the southeast of Mong Kok is Ho Man Tin and to the west Tai Kok Tsui.

On 10 August 2008, the Cornwall Court fire broke out. More than 200 firefighters were involved in the rescue operation. Four people died, including two firefighters.

Mong Kok received a lot of negative media attention for many acid attacks on Sai Yeung Choi Street from December 2008 through January 2010.

The area was the site of protracted demonstrations during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, including the &quot;gau wu&quot; campaign, and was also the site of the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest.

==Streets and markets==


Mong Kok preserves its traditional characteristics with an array of markets, small shops, and food stalls that have disappeared from other areas during the past several decades of economic developments and urban transformation. As such, a few of these streets in Mong Kok have acquired nicknames reflecting their own characteristics. Some interesting sites are:

* Tung Choi Street () (also known as , &quot;Ladies&#x27; Market&quot;) – This market specialises in women&#x27;s clothing, accessories, and cosmetics, and is open daily from noon to midnight.
* Sai Yeung Choi Street South () – A street full of shops selling consumer electronic products, cosmetics, and discount books. The latter are usually located on the lower floors of buildings.
* Yuen Po Street Bird Garden () – Hundreds of songbirds in exquisitely crafted cages can be seen at this market. The garden is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and is located near Mong Kok Stadium, to the north of Mong Kok East station and east of Prince Edward station.
*: The garden was completed in 1997 for the relocation of booths selling birds at Hong Lok Street (), aka. &quot;Bird Street&quot;, which was closed due to urban renewal in June 1998.
* Fa Yuen Street () (also known as ) – This is a small neighbourhood of small retailers selling sports equipment and clothing. The shops stock a diversity of sports shoes, including many shoes of rare or special editions from different places.
* Flower Market Road () – The street and the nearby side streets are packed with florists and street vendors selling flowers and plants. At the end of the street is Yuen Po Street Bird Garden.
* Goldfish Street () or Goldfish Market – Centered on a section of Tung Choi Street, north of Bute Street. There are dozens of shops selling tropical freshwater and marine fish, aquariums and accessories. This market opens very early in the morning.
* Tile Street () – This is a section of Portland Street near Argyle Street and Bute Street with more than 50 retailers selling materials for construction or renovation, such as tiles, wall paper, window frames and bath tubs.
* Photocopy Street () – A neighbourhood near Yim Po Fong Street and Soy Street is noted for its remarkable number of photocopying shops due to the number of schools in the vicinity. The shops also have ID photo taking service.
* Portland Street () – A red-light district featuring numerous shops and restaurants.
* Kwong Wa Street (), between Dundas Street and Yim Po Fong Street, is famous for shops selling airsoft, RC racing, modelling and other hobbying equipment.
* Dundas Street () marks the southern end of the shopping area in eastern Mong Kok, where Sai Yeung Choi Street South, Tung Choi Street and Fa Yuen Street terminate. It is named for Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, former British Home Secretary and Secretary of State for War. It is unclear why the street was bestowed in his honour although, as a former British colony, many of Hong Kong&#x27;s streets and institutions were named in memory of prominent English historic and political figures. Ho King Shopping Centre and Trendy Zone are major shopping centres on the street. Various kinds of snack food shops concentrate on this street. Kwong Wah Hospital is also situated on the street. Across Nathan Road, the section in the western Mong Kok is relatively quiet and there are many cafés above street level in several buildings.

Some popular shopping plazas located in this dense area include:

* T.O.P (This is Our Place) - Latest fashionable shopping centre for youngers. No high-end shops there but specially characteristic store. An overpass corridor connected to Argyle Centre ().

* Sino Centre () – Most shops sell Japanimation figures and merchandising. Other shops sell comic books, VCDs and DVDs related to Japanese cartoons, and regular CD albums.
* Ho King Shopping Centre () – Visitors can find computer and video games sold for relatively low prices. The fourth floor of the plaza is infamous for being formerly the biggest base of pornographic CDs and DVDs, and activities have diminished due to police and customs operations. However, some shops have been driven to the office section of the building.
* Grand Century Place () – Situated next to Mong Kok East station, visitors can find famous-brand and popular shops.
* Mong Kok Computer Centre () – This three-story computer mall has around 50 to 70 computer shops, selling laptops, software, hardware and computer accessories.
* Langham Place () – This is a 59-storey complex with a huge shopping mall, a hotel, and offices. It opened in 2004 and was constructed based on the Hong Kong Government urban redevelopment scheme. It is the tallest building in Mong Kok.
*Argyle Centre () – This usually crowded centre, located next to Mong Kok Station, has three floors of shops selling female low-priced clothes and shoes. Also a lot of snack food and drinks shop there.
*Trendy Zone ()
*W Plaza ()

*Richmond Shopping Arcade ()
*Hollywood Plaza ()
*CTMA Centre ()

Other streets in the area include:
* Bute Street (), named after John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1762 and 1763. It may also have been named after the Scottish peerage of the same name, following the naming pattern of several other streets in the area.
* Fife Street () is a street that is north of Argyle Street, south of Mong Kok Road, and perpendicular to Nathan Road. The Chinese name means &quot;fast wealth&quot; in English, but the name is a loanword based on the English pronunciation of the fife instrument.
* Soy Street ()

== Food ==
The Mong Kok area has many food-booths selling traditional snacks such as fish balls, fried beancurd (tofu) and various dim sum.

<text>Peijaiset (in dialectal forms peijahaiset, peijaat or peijaajaiset) is a Finnish concept, dating to pre-Christian times, denoting a memorial feast (akin to a wake) that was held to honour a slain animal, particularly the bear, the animal most sacred to ancient Finns. In modern-day usage, it often refers to the celebrations following a successful elk hunt, or a feast at the end of a hunting season. It may also be used in a figurative sense, denoting any memorial held for things that have come to an end (&quot;peijaiset&quot; over e.g. bankrupt companies). Traditionally, it referred to wakes for humans and animals, but also other celebrations, depending on the region in question. 

Karhunpeijaiset (lit. a bear wake) is a celebration held for the soul of a slain bear after a successful bear hunt. Traditionally, a bear was never &quot;hunted&quot; but was merely &quot;brought down&quot;. A single man could claim to have hunted and killed a bear, but when the entire community was involved, the bear was simply said to have died. The bear&#x27;s spirit had to be told that it had fallen into a pit or that it had otherwise killed itself by accident, not by the hunters, to appease the bear&#x27;s spirit so that it would not be offended, and possibly exact revenge upon the hunters. The ceremony was always a much more elaborate affair than what the most influential member of the community would have merited. In eastern Finland, it would have copious mourners and wailers, and the people would address the bear as a relative, or the son of a god. Its flesh was not eaten, which would have been cannibalism, or, if it was, an elaborate show was made to symbolically render the meat into that of another animal such as venison. The bear&#x27;s head was usually mounted on the top of a young tree, or on a pike, so as to help the bear&#x27;s spirit climb up into the stars (specifically, the constellation of the Great Bear), where it was believed bears&#x27; souls had come from. Carrion-eaters would then eat it, leaving only the skull, which would then become an object of veneration. A courtyard would also be cleared around the skull. Traditionally, only bears were honoured thus.

Sometimes, the ceremony was performed in the fashion of a sacred marriage rather than a wake. In such cases, the bear was either propped up inside of a frame or strapped to a cross. With all due ceremony, the chosen bride or groom would symbolically marry the bear.

In the present day, &quot;peijaiset&quot; usually refers to a celebration at the end of a successful hunt or the end of a hunting season, and they are usually only held for moose and bears. On many occasions, it involves a festive evening meal for the hunters, made from the latest kill.

Similar customs have been reported from many other northern people who share their habitat with bears.

<text>Super Rugby is a men&#x27;s professional rugby union club competition involving teams from Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. It has previously included teams from Argentina, Japan, and South Africa. Super Rugby started as the Super 12 in the 1996 season with 12 teams from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, building on competitions dating back to the South Pacific Championship in 1986. The Super 12 was established by SANZAR after the sport became professional in 1995. After the COVID-19 pandemic forced the competition to split into three, the reformed competition in 2021 only included teams from Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands.

The name was changed to Super 14 with the addition of two teams for the 2006 season, and with expansion to 15 teams for the 2011 season, the competition was rebranded as Super Rugby (with no number). In 2016 two new teams, the Jaguares from Argentina and Sunwolves from Japan, joined the competition, playing in two newly separated African groups. In 2018, the Cheetahs, Kings and Western Force were dropped, leaving 15 teams. The Sunwolves left the competition before the end of the 2020 season.

The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to international travel restrictions relating to the pandemic, Rugby Australia and New Zealand Rugby held domestic tournaments, Super Rugby AU and Super Rugby Aotearoa respectively. Both these tournaments continued in 2021, to be followed by Super Rugby Trans-Tasman, a crossover tournament. In September 2020, the South African Rugby Union withdrew their four franchises from the competition, with plans for them to join the PRO14. The Argentine Jaguares also left the competition.

In August 2021 a 12-team format was confirmed, with the addition of the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika, a team representing the Pacific islands. The tournament for 2022 and 2023 was named Super Rugby Pacific.

The competition has been dominated by New Zealand teams, who have won 19 times in 26 years. The have won most often, with 12 titles.

==Organisation and format==
===SANZAAR===
SANZAAR is the body that administers Super Rugby, and has the Australian, New Zealand, South African and Argentine rugby unions as its members. SANZAAR also runs the Rugby Championship tournament that is contested by Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa following the conclusion of the Super Rugby tournament; the Tri-Nations preceded the Rugby Championship before Argentina joined the competition. The organisation was formed in 1996 to establish and run the Super 12, and Tri-Nations Tournament.

===Competition format===
Prior to 2011, Super Rugby was a round-robin competition where each team played every other team once; a team had six or seven home games, and six or seven away games each. The winner received four competition points; if the game was a draw two points were awarded to each team. The bonus points system was also used, where any team scoring four or more tries, and/or losing by seven points or less, receives an extra competition point. In 2016, the try bonus changed. A team now has to score three more tries than their opponents. The top four teams at the end of the round-robin phase then played semi-finals – the first placed team hosting the fourth placed team, and the second placed team hosting the third placed team. The two winners then played the final at the home ground of the top surviving seed. There were 91 regular season games in total. Games were held over 14 weekends with each team receiving one bye.

From 2011 – 2015 the format changed, with each country forming its own conference. Each team within a conference played each of the other teams in its conference twice, once at home and once away. Each team then played four out of the five teams from each of the other conferences once. Competition points were awarded on a similar basis as before. The format of the finals also changed; it involved six teams: the top team in each of the three conferences plus the three next teams with the highest total number of points, regardless of conference. The four lower ranking teams were paired in two sudden death games; the winners of those two games each played one of the two top ranked teams (which received a bye at the start of the finals). Those winners played for the championship.

For the 2016 and 2017 seasons the format changed again, with three more teams joining, one each from Argentina, Japan and South Africa. There were four conferences, with Africa getting two conferences. The finals had eight teams with each conference winner getting a home quarter final. They were joined by four wild card teams, three from the Australasian group and one from the South African group.

From the 2018 season the format changed again, with two South African teams and an Australian team being dropped. There were three conferences, one containing the five New Zealand teams, a South African one including Argentina&#x27;s team and an Australian one including Japan&#x27;s team.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the competition had to undergo a change in structure and be split into regionalised tournaments. There were two national competitions, Australia&#x27;s Super Rugby AU and New Zealand&#x27;s Super Rugby Aotearoa, and those were followed by Super Rugby Trans-Tasman in 2021, a crossover competition involving the five Australian sides playing the five New Zealand sides. Super Rugby currently only consists of Australian and New Zealand sides, with the Japanese Sunwolves departing the competition after the 2020 season, the South African sides voting to leave to join an expanded PRO14 (Later known as the United Rugby Championship), and the Argentine Jaguares not set to compete in any Super Rugby tournament in 2021.

From 2022, the tournament reverted to round robin format featuring 12 teams, with the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika joining the competition. There are no divisions from 2022 onwards, with one main log being used instead, and top 8 teams qualifying for the playoffs.

Since 2022, each Super Rugby season has featured a &quot;Super Round&quot;, where an entire round of Super Rugby matches is played over a weekend at a single stadium; both the 2022 and 2023 Super Rounds were played at AAMI Park in Melbourne, with the 2024 Super Round set to be played there as well.

==History==
===Background===
Before 1996, a number of transnational competitions involving regional and provincial rugby union teams had taken shape in the southern hemisphere. The earliest of these was the South Pacific Championship, which was launched in 1986 and continued until 1990.
====Super 6====
After the demise of the South Pacific Championship, with no tournament played in 1991, the competition was relaunched as the Super 6 in 1992. The original Super 6 competition consisted of three provincial teams from New Zealand: Auckland, Canterbury, Wellington; along with two Australian state teams: Queensland and New South Wales; and also the Fiji national team.

====Super 10====

In 1993, the Super Six competition was revamped and expanded into the Super 10 tournament. With South Africa being readmitted into international sport following the dismantling of apartheid, there was an opportunity to launch an expanded competition which would also feature South Africa&#x27;s top provincial teams. The inaugural competition featured the following teams: Waikato, Auckland, Otago and North Harbour (New Zealand); Natal, Northern Transvaal and Transvaal (South Africa); Queensland and New South Wales (Australia) and Western Samoa (Pacific Tri-Nations winner). The Super 10 was won by Transvaal (South Africa) in 1993, and by Queensland (Australia) in 1994 and 1995.

===SANZAR era===
====Super 12 (1995–2005)====
The official declaration of professionalism in rugby union in August 1995 led to a restructuring of the Super 10 competition. Following the success of the 1995 World Cup, the rugby boards of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa formed SANZAR (South African, New Zealand and Australian Rugby) to administer an annual 12-team provincial/franchise based competition pitting regional teams from the three nations against each other. In addition it was decided to hold an annual Tri-Nations Test Series between the three countries. A significant reason for the development of the Super 12 was the threat to rugby union from rival football code rugby league: part of the business model for the Foxtel pay TV network in Australia was to attract subscribers by offering an exclusive product (such as rugby union) which could not be seen on free-to-air broadcast television. By setting up the Super 12, the Unions had a product that was in demand from viewers, enabling them to sell a 10-year contract for exclusive television rights to News Corp for US$555 million, giving them both coverage and financial support to kickstart the new competition.

With significant sponsorship, and rugby turning a professional sport in August 1995, the Super 12 competition successfully kicked off in 1996 with five New Zealand franchises, four South African provinces and three domestic Australian teams competing. New Zealand&#x27;s dominance of the competition began in the first year when the Auckland Blues won the inaugural competition defeating South African side the 45–21 in a home final. The Blues would repeat the success of 1996 beating Australian side the ACT Brumbies 23–7 in the 1997 final.

The Blues then reached their third successive final in 1998 but went down to fellow countrymen the Canterbury Crusaders 13–20. This would mark the beginning of the Crusaders&#x27; three-year dominance as they went on to win the 1999 and 2000 finals over the Otago Highlanders and ACT Brumbies respectively. The 2001 season was the first in which no New Zealand franchise reached the final, being contested between the ACT Brumbies and with the Brumbies convincing winners, with a 36–6 scoreline.

The Crusaders won their 4th final in 2002 winning all 11 matches and missed out on their 5th in 2003 with a four-point loss to fellow countrymen the Blues. In 2004 the Brumbies took revenge on their 2000 final loss to the Crusaders defeating them 47–38 in front of a home crowd. The Crusaders would bounce back to win the 2005 final 35–25 against the Australian side the New South Wales Waratahs who reached their first-ever final. This was the last year of the 12 team format.

From the early 2000s, Australia had started to push for the inclusion of a fourth Australian team, and South Africa for another team from its country. There was also speculation of including a team from the South Pacific Island nations, such as Fiji; or a combined Pacific Islanders team from Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Argentina was also pushing for inclusion in the Super 12. In the early 2000s, the provincial names from the New Zealand franchises were dropped, so, for example, the Canterbury Crusaders became The Crusaders. Also South Africa followed the New Zealand franchise model, where previously South African participation was decided by the previous year&#x27;s Currie Cup placings.

====Super 14 (2006–2010)====
SANZAR announced in December 2004 that a new five-year television deal had been signed that would cover 2006 to 2010, with News Corporation winning the rights for the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and SuperSport winning rights for South Africa. The contract was worth US$323 million over five years, a 16% annual increase compared to the previous deal. It covers international fixtures as well as the Super 14. SANZAR remained free to negotiate separate deals for other markets, such as France, Japan and the Americas.

Under the new deal, Australia and South Africa each got one extra team in the competition, and a third round of fixtures was added to the Tri Nations Series. The new Australian team in the competition was based in Perth and was named the Western Force.

The addition of the new South African team led to considerable controversy, including government involvement. Finally, the five teams for 2006 were confirmed to be the country&#x27;s existing four teams plus the Cheetahs, which draws its players from the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces. For the 2007 season, the Southern Spears, based in Port Elizabeth, were originally intended to replace the lowest-finishing South African team from the 2006 competition. However, the existing South African Super 14 franchises opposed the plan, which was pushed through by controversial president of the South African Rugby Union, Brian van Rooyen. After van Rooyen was ousted as president, SARU announced that the Spears would not enter the competition. SARU investigated the viability of the Spears after discovering serious financial irregularities. A High Court of South Africa ruling stated that the Spears had a valid contract to compete in the Super 14 and Currie Cup. However, because of the organisation&#x27;s financial and administrative troubles, in November 2006 a settlement was reached. The Spears abandoned their legal case, and will continue to exist, but not compete in the Super 14.

SANZAR rejected a proposal to split the Super 14 into two seven-team divisions, and decided to keep the competition in its traditional single-table format. Argentina and the Pacific Islands remained shut out of the competition.

The two new teams did not perform all that well, the South African franchise the Cheetahs did the better of the two teams finishing 10th on the ladder notching up 5 season wins. The Australian franchise the Western Force only managed one victory and ended winning the wooden spoon as last placed 14th. The highlight for the Force was a 23-all draw against eventual champions the Crusaders, who defeated first-time finalists the Hurricanes 19–12.

During the 2007 season, 22 All Blacks missed the competition&#x27;s first seven rounds as part of an All Black &quot;conditioning programme&quot; that was a part of the All Blacks&#x27; 2007 Rugby World Cup preparations, and every New Zealand franchise was without players for the first seven rounds.
At the end of the regular season, for the first time since 1998, no Australian franchise had made the semi-finals. Although the Brumbies were strong and the Western Force experienced vast improvement, it was a poor season for the Queensland Reds and Waratahs who finished last and second last respectively. Also, the competition featured the first all-South African final as the Sharks and Bulls, who finished 1–2 on the season ladder, both won their respective semi-finals. The final, held in Durban, saw the visiting Bulls win 20–19.

During the time the competition was branded as the Super 14, only two teams won the tournament. The Crusaders winning the 2006 and 2008 tournaments; while the Bulls ended victorious in 2007, 2009, and 2010 respectively.

====Super Rugby: 15 teams (2011–2015)====
SANZAR unveiled in 2009 its model for an expanded season that would begin in 2011. This model was based around the original ARU proposal for three national conferences: each side were to have played the other four teams from their own country twice and the other ten teams once each; the season has to end with a six-team finals series.

There were four major compromises, however, designed to accommodate certain wishes of each country, that somewhat complicated the model: 
* Each team would only play four, instead of all five, teams in each of the other two national conferences, making sixteen regular season games for each team instead of eighteen, and allowing for a late February start, somewhat placating the ARU and NZRU who wanted a March start.
* There would be a three-week gap for the June test (international) matches favoured by the SARU.
* The season would finish in early August so as not to overlap new streamlined versions of New Zealand&#x27;s and South Africa&#x27;s domestic competitions.
* The three conference winners and the three best performers of the remaining teams would qualify for a three-week finals series, with seedings deciding the match-ups. This system is a hybrid of the conference-based qualification system favoured by the SARU and the &#x27;top six&#x27; model favoured by the ARU and NZRU.

SANZAR announced in 2009 the addition of a fifth Australian team that would play in the expanded &quot;Super Rugby&quot; competition in 2011. The licence was awarded to Victoria, Australia, and the team&#x27;s name announced as the Melbourne Rebels. The Australian start-up franchise was given the nod ahead of South Africa&#x27;s Southern Kings. Brian Waldron, former CEO of the NRL club the Melbourne Storm, was confirmed as the new CEO of the Rebels on 11 January 2010, but resigned on 23 April after a salary cap breach was uncovered at the Storm.

===SANZAAR era===
====Expansion: 18 teams (2016–2017)====
In February 2012, SANZAR chief executive Greg Peters announced that the organisation was considering adding franchises in Argentina, Japan and the United States in 2016, the first year of SANZAR&#x27;s next television contract. This was also the year that rugby sevens entered the Olympics, which contributed towards increased interest in the sport in many countries, including Japan and the US.

Australian sports broadcasting analyst Colin Smith noted that the addition of Japanese and American teams could result in a TV deal worth more than A$1 billion beyond 2020. Specifically, he stated, &quot;You could have a deal comparable to the other major sports in Australia. Rugby is a college (university) sport in the US, if soccer can create its own league there and sell teams for $40 million, imagine what you could do in 10–12 years with rugby in that market.&quot; By comparison, the largest TV deal in Australian sport, that of the Australian Football League (Australian rules), is worth A$1.26 billion from 2012 to 2016. Even that figure was dwarfed by the TV contracts of the NFL, for which contracts at the time were worth more than US$4 billion annually.

Peters added that the conference-based structure was ideal for expanding the competition to new territories, either by adding new conferences or by adding teams to the current conferences. He also discussed the possibility that offshore Super Rugby teams could be a home for surplus players from the SANZAR countries, keeping them in the SANZAR fold and away from European clubs.

Prior to Super Rugby&#x27;s broadcast contracts expiring after the 2015 season, SANZAR considered several alternatives for the competition&#x27;s future organisation:

* Retention of the conference system that was in place for 2011–15.
* Expansion of the structure to include teams from Asia, the United States and/or Canada.
* A split of the competition, with South Africa forming one competition with the likely addition of at least one Argentine side, and Australia and New Zealand forming another, with the possibility of including Asian teams.

The last proposal, made by the SARU, was reportedly driven by internal union politics. With only five guaranteed places in Super Rugby but six active franchises, the bottom team in the South African Conference faced a promotion/relegation playoff with the sixth franchise for a place in the next season&#x27;s competition. Australia and New Zealand warmed to the SARU proposal, as a trans-Tasman competition would potentially allow for more regional derbies, fewer time zone complications and less player travel. However, NZRU chief executive Steve Tew indicated that a competition that did not include South African teams was a commercial non-starter because of large broadcast revenues from that country and because the NZRU considered Super Rugby matches in South Africa to be critical for national team development.

SANZAR announced on 4 September 2013 that South Africa would be granted a sixth franchise starting in the 2016 season, negating the need for relegation play-offs involving the sixth South African franchise. SANZAR then announced on 20 November 2014 that Japan and Argentina would each be allocated a team from the 2016 season onwards.

In 2017, the Australian Rugby Union was rebranded to Rugby Australia.

====Contraction: 15 teams (2018–2020)====
In April 2017, SANZAAR confirmed the competition would be reduced to 15 teams in 2018 with two South African and one Australian team to have their franchises withdrawn. Subsequently, four South African teams took part: the Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers, with the Cheetahs and Kings losing their spots. The Cheetahs and Kings joined the Pro 12, which became the Pro14 from the 2017–2018 season onwards. On 11 August 2017, Australia announced that the Western Force had lost their licence. On 21 March 2019, SANZAAR confirmed that 2020 will be the Sunwolves last season of competition in Super Rugby.

==== COVID-19: Separate competitions and South African departure (2020–2021) ====
The global COVID-19 pandemic caused the 2020 Super Rugby competition to be cut short. As health concerns eased, other professional sports returned to play. The Super Rugby season was unable to resumed, however, due to border restrictions and the need for teams to be placed into quarantine upon arrival in each country. This resulted in New Zealand Rugby and Rugby Australia forming their own Super Rugby tournaments starting in June and July respectively, so that their teams could compete domestically. South African Rugby subsequently launched its own domestic Super Rugby competition which started play in October 2020.

The three competitions formed were:

* Super Rugby Aotearoa (5 teams, New Zealand)
* Super Rugby AU (5 teams, Australia)
* Super Rugby Unlocked (7 teams, South Africa)

Super Rugby Aotearoa featured all five New Zealand teams from Super Rugby: the Blues, Chiefs, Crusaders, Highlanders and Hurricanes. Super Rugby AU included Australia&#x27;s four teams, the Reds, Waratahs, Brumbies and Rebels, as well as former Super Rugby side, the Western Force. The Force had continued as a franchise after their 2017 post-season exclusion from Super Rugby and were playing in Global Rapid Rugby, also suspended due to COVID-19. The Australian and New Zealand competitions each scheduled a 20-game home and away season in 2020 but Super Rugby AU played two additional knockout matches to decide the Australian title.

Super Rugby Unlocked featured South Africa&#x27;s four Super Rugby teams (the Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers) plus former franchise the as well as the Currie Cup sides and . These seven teams competed in a single round-robin domestic format in 2020.

In September 2020, SA Rugby announced the withdrawal from Super Rugby of all of their teams, with plans for the four sides to join an expanded Pro14/United Rugby Championship competition. Super Rugby Aotearoa and Super Rugby AU continued in 2021, Super Rugby Trans-Tasman would also take place in 2021, a crossover competition featuring the Australian sides playing the New Zealand sides.

==== Super Rugby Pacific: Fiji and the Pacific Islands join the competition (2022–) ====
In the longer term, a new 12-team tournament from 2022 onwards had been mooted, with the current five Australian and five New Zealand sides to be joined by Moana Pasifika, and a Fijian side. New Zealand Rugby has confirmed that it intends to partner with Fiji Rugby and Moana Pasifika, along with Australia going forward. In April 2021, it was announced that licences had been offered to the Fijian Drua and Moana Pasifika ahead of joining Super Rugby in 2022. The new format was confirmed in August 2021, with the tournament branded as Super Rugby Pacific, with the competition returning to a round robin format, although the divisions will be replaced by one main log instead.

In 2024, the Melbourne Rebels, following a period of financial difficulties and being placed into administration, were shut down by Rugby Australia. The Rebels board have challenged the decision to cut the team and have taken Rugby Australia to court over the decision. The Rebels will not take part in the 2025 Super Rugby season.

==Current franchises==
There are eleven franchises currently in Super Rugby; four from Australia, one from Fiji, five from New Zealand, and one representing the Pacific Islands. Each franchise is representing a franchise area, with each franchise in New Zealand representing a collection of unions, compared to the Australian model of one franchise per union. This model differs from the traditional club-based model of other Australian sports; with 4 Super Rugby teams in Australia compared to the 16 Australian-based National Rugby League teams and the 18 teams of the Australian Football League. The Pacific Islands franchise, Moana Pasifika, played mainly in New Zealand during the 2022 season.

* Notes:
===Regionalised Competition winners===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, regionalised tournaments were played for the remainder of the 2020 Super Rugby season and the 2021 Super Rugby season. Those competitions were: Super Rugby AU (Australia), Super Rugby Aotearoa (New Zealand), Super Rugby Unlocked (South Africa) and Super Rugby Trans-Tasman (Australia and New Zealand).

* South Africa withdrew from all Super Rugby competitions at the end of the 2020 Super Rugby season.

=== Final appearances, victories by country ===

In the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by victorious seasons.


===Semi-final appearances by team===

* 21 Crusaders (16 wins, 5 losses)
* 12 Brumbies (6 wins, 6 losses)
* 12 Hurricanes (3 wins, 9 losses)
* 9 Blues (6 wins, 3 losses)
* 9 Chiefs (5 wins, 4 losses)
* 8 Sharks (4 wins, 4 losses)
* 8 Waratahs (3 wins, 5 losses)
* 7 Bulls (3 wins, 4 losses)
* 5 Lions (3 wins, 2 losses) (2 losses as the Cats)
* 5 Highlanders (2 wins, 3 losses)
* 4 Reds (1 win, 3 losses)
* 4 Stormers (1 win, 3 losses)
* 1 Jaguares (1 win)

===Conference winners by team===
Between 2011 and 2019, teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have played in 3 separate conferences. With teams playing each team in their own conference twice (home and away) and in the other conferences playing four of the five teams. The winner of each conference is awarded a home final and their region specific conference trophy. In 2016, the South Africa conference was split in two, with Japan&#x27;s Sunwolves and Argentina&#x27;s Jaguares added to South Africa 1 and 2, respectively. In 2018, the South African conferences re-integrated, with Argentina&#x27;s Jaguares remaining in the South Africa conference, and Japan&#x27;s Sunwolves joining the Australia conference.

==Salary cap==
===Australia===
The five Australian teams playing in the competition are subjected to a A$5.5 million salary cap for a squad of up to 40 players per Australian team. The Australian Rugby Union decided in 2011 to introduce the salary cap because of financial pressures. Originally starting in 2012 as a cap of A$4.1 million, it was later raised to A$4.5 million for the 2013 and 2014 seasons to take pressure off the teams&#x27; ability to recruit and retain players. The salary cap is a key component of the negotiation between the ARU and the Rugby Union Players Association over the collective bargaining agreement. The fact that the Australian teams in Super Rugby face a salary cap has been attributed as a factor that makes it more difficult for Australian teams to win the title.

The cap regulations have some small concessions:
* Five players on each team may be paid A$30,000 each per season by team sponsors; this amount is not included in the team cap.
* The maximum cap charge for a non-Australian player is A$137,000, regardless of his actual wages.

Compared to other Australian &#x27;rival&#x27; sporting leagues, such as the NRL and AFL, the salary cap is considerably lower. Two times lower than the AFL and only makes up 55% of the NRL salary cap. However the Australian Super Rugby salary cap stands greater than the A-League, the BBL and the NBL.

==Brand and image==

===Trophies===

There have been several iterations of the trophy awarded to the winner of the Super Rugby competitions.

The Super 14 trophy, unveiled in New Zealand ahead of the 2006 season, was made of sterling silver with the competition logo on a globe sitting atop of a four-sided twisted spiral. Jens Hansen Gold and Silversmith in Nelson, New Zealand hand-made the trophy which took over two months to complete.

On 30 June 2011, SANZAR unveiled the new trophy that will be presented to the winners of the Super Rugby final from 2011 and beyond, was crafted from solid stainless steel and polished to a mirror finish. It has a height of 65 cm and a mass of 18 kilograms.
The trophy was designed by Blue Sky Design of Sydney. The trophy was manufactured by Box and Dice Pty Ltd also based in Sydney.

SANZAR CEO Greg Peters said &quot;The shape of the trophy is centred around three curved legs, each representing the Conferences involved in the Super Rugby competition . . . The champions trophy is the &#x27;big one&#x27;, and will become the ultimate symbol of Super Rugby supremacy in the years to come.&quot;

The colour on each leg corresponds to the Conferences with gold for Australia, black for New Zealand, and green for South Africa.

There are several other trophies contested during the competition; the Charles Anderson VC Memorial Cup between the Brumbies and Stormers, the Bob Templeton Cup between the Reds and Waratahs, the Ganbattle Trophy between Sunwolves and Rebels and the Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy between the Blues and Highlanders.
Every year the Super Rugby player of the year is awarded.

===Logo===
During the last season of the Super 12, Coast Design of Sydney was commissioned to design a new logo for the Super 14. The Super 14 logo broke away from the traditional shield formats, common to many sporting codes, and used Roman numerals (XIV), which is unique for sport in the region. The game&#x27;s dynamism and speed are suggested by the orbiting football which has three distinct stitches, a subtle reference to the three countries of the tournament.

The Super Rugby logo dispenses with numbers, featuring a large blue &quot;S&quot; with a white rugby ball in the centre and &quot;SRY&quot; below the &quot;S&quot;. The three stitches of the previous ball are retained.

Before the expansion to the Super 14, the Super 12 used a logo in the shape of a shield, which had the sponsors name at the top, and then the words &quot;Rugby&quot; and &quot;Super 12&quot;. The lower half of the logo used three different coloured stripes, green, black and gold, the respective colours of the national teams of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia.

===Naming rights===
The naming rights for the competition are different in the five countries:
* In New Zealand, Investec Bank has naming rights starting with the 2011 season, and the competition is referred to as Investec Super Rugby. During the Super 14 era, sporting goods retailer Rebel Sport had naming rights and the Super 14 competition was referred to as the Rebel Sport Super 14. Previously the naming rights holders were U-Bix and then Telecom New Zealand (TNZ). Telecom used its ISP brand Xtra as the label in their last year of holding naming rights.
* In Australia, telecommunications company Vodafone has been the title sponsor of Super Rugby since 2017 As a result, the competition is officially referred to as Vodafone Super Rugby. Prior to this, Super Rugby in Australia was sponsored by Suncorp Group through their life insurance brand Asteron Life. Vodafone were also the title sponsor of the competition during the Super 12 era. In the first season of Super Rugby, Australia had no naming rights partner. Previous to that, Investec acquired naming rights in the middle of the Super 14 era from Lion Nathan, who had named the competition the &quot;Tooheys New Super 14&quot;, after its Tooheys New beer brand. 
*In South Africa, telecommunications carrier Vodacom has naming rights, and the expanded competition is referred to as Vodacom Super Rugby. Before 1999, when cigarette advertising was banned in South Africa, the competition was sponsored by Winfield.
*In Argentina, telecommunications carrier Personal has naming rights, and the expanded competition is referred to as Personal Super Rugby.
*In Japan, real estate developer Mitsubishi Estate acquired naming rights in 2018, the competition referred to as Mitsubishi Estate Super Rugby. The competition had no title sponsor in Japan during the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

==Domestic competitions==
Each respective country competing in Super Rugby has a number of their own domestic leagues, which feed into Super Rugby teams.

South Africa actually used their Currie Cup teams as opposed to creating new teams during the earlier years of the Super 12. However, the Currie Cup is now the third tier of rugby in South Africa, below Test and Super Rugby; it is played after the Super Rugby season, and all unions are aligned to a Super Rugby team, though it is mainly the big six, Blue Bulls, Golden Lions, , Free State Cheetahs, Western Province and Eastern Province Elephants which contribute the most to the Super Rugby sides.

In New Zealand, the National Provincial Championship is the most prominent domestic competition below the Super Rugby, in which all the respective Unions are also aligned with Super Rugby sides.

In Australia, the National Rugby Championship (NRC) was launched in 2014. Several teams that played in the former Australian Rugby Championship in 2007, were revived for the NRC.

Argentina, until 2018, like South Africa and New Zealand, had a national championship where several provincial unions competed, the Campeonato Argentino. Another national championship, but for clubs, is Nacional de Clubes.

Japan&#x27;s main domestic competition was the Japan Rugby League One (formerly Top League), featuring 16 clubs, while the second division, the Top Challenge League, featured 8 clubs.

Fiji&#x27;s domestic competition is the Skipper Cup, featuring the countries top 12 provincial sides.

==Media==
Until 2020, in Australia, pay TV station Fox Sports showed every match live and beginning in 2016, free-to-air station Network Ten started showing a full match replay every Sunday morning of the &#x27;Match of the Round&#x27; featuring at least one Australian team. Network Ten also showed full match replays of all finals matches featuring Australian teams. From 2021 onwards, Nine Network possesses the broadcasting rights, and any future Super Rugby seasons will have games aired live on streaming service Stan, with the potential for a number of games to be simulcast live on either Nine&#x27;s flagship free-to-air channel or a multichannel, similar to the current situation with Super Rugby AU.

Super Rugby is broadcast on Supersport in South Africa and is simulcast terrestrially on M-Net. Sky Sport is the official broadcaster in New Zealand. Super Rugby was broadcast in over 40 countries – in the UK on Sky Sports; in Spain it is broadcast by Digital+, and in the United States by ESPN+, which has confirmed all matches will be broadcast live or on demand. In Canada, TSN broadcasts all matches only on TSN GO, their online SD streaming platform. Following the 2020 season though, broadcasting deals with European broadcasters ended, and no new deal had been arranged for the start of the 2021 season.

On 24 February 2021, RugbyPass announced streaming rights for the Super Rugby Aotearoa competition, to be streamed in all territories in the UK &amp; Ireland, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, totalling 100 territories.

On 6 March 2021, World Rugby announced streaming for the Super Rugby AU competition, to be streamed in all territories in the UK &amp; Ireland, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, totalling over 100 territories.

On 19 March 2021, further broadcasters were announced for both competitions, with ESPN and ESPN International being announced as covering North and South America, Digicel covering the Pacific Islands and Papua New Guinea, covering Spain and Wowow covering Japan.

On 13 May 2021, further broadcasters were announced for Super Rugby Trans-Tasman, with RugbyPass picking up streaming services in European territories again for the tournament. Canal+ was announced as covering France, ESPN Argentina covering the United States, Premier Sports covering Southeast Asia, Sky Italia covering Italy and TSN covering Canada.

On 14 February 2022, SANZAAR announced the launch of Sanzaarrugby.tv, a global streaming service for the Super Rugby competition to territories that don&#x27;t have right holder broadcasters in place.

The current broadcasters ahead of the 2022 Super Rugby Pacific season are:

<text>Hong Kong Tramways (HKT) is a narrow-gauge tram system in Hong Kong. Owned and operated by RATP Dev, the tramway runs on Hong Kong Island between Kennedy Town and Shau Kei Wan, with a branch circulating through Happy Valley.

Hong Kong&#x27;s tram system is one of the earliest forms of public transport in the metropolis, having opened in 1904 under British rule. It has used electric trams since its inauguration, and has never used horse or steam power. It owns the world&#x27;s largest operational double-decker tram fleet, and is a very rare example of a tram system that uses them exclusively. In addition to being used by commuters, the system is popular with tourists, and is one of the most environmentally friendly ways of travelling in the city.
==History==
In 1881, Hon. F. Bulkeley Johnson, with the support of Ng Choy, proposed a Bill for the construction of a tramway system in Hong Kong. The following year, the Hong Kong Government published the preliminary Tramways Ordinance, which included six tramlines. However, the focus was primarily on the Peak Tram, which was of greater interest to the government and business interests residing on Victoria Peak, leading to the neglect of the tram proposal along Hong Kong Island.

Between 1883 and 1888, the population of Hong Kong increased from 173,475 to 215,800. The government hoped that the tram system would provide quick access to all areas of Victoria and reduce dependence on chair coolies. The Bill underwent several readings and was finally passed on May 23, 1902, as the Tramways Ordinance (No. 10 of 1902).

In 1902, the Hong Kong Tramway Electric Company Limited was founded in London and came under the control of the Electric Traction Company of Hong Kong Limited by the end of the year. Track construction began in stages from Happy Valley, Causeway Bay to Shau Kei Wan in September 1903, and was connected westbound to Arsenal Street by August 1904. Regular tram service commenced on July 30, 1904, with twenty-six single-deck cars delivered in sections and assembled in the depot. These cars included ten combination cars with enclosed saloons and open ends and platforms, and sixteen crossbench cars. Fares for first and third class were ten cents and five cents respectively, with preferential fares for workers on workmen’s cars from 1904 to 1909.

In 1910, the company name was changed to “Hong Kong Tramway Company Limited.” Due to increasing ridership, ten double-deckers were introduced in 1912, featuring an open-top design with destination boxes and reversible seats on the upper deck. By 1913, open-top cars were fitted with canvas roofs for wet weather protection, and the first dividend was paid by HKT for the year 1912. The Happy Valley track was extended by 600 yards.

In 1914, the London Board was disbanded and replaced by a Hong Kong Board with local Directors. In 1922, HKT stopped generating its own electricity and obtained its supply from the Hong Kong Electric Company. The company name was changed to “Hong Kong Tramways Limited” (HKT). Wooden roofs were progressively fitted on tramcars in 1923, and double track construction between Causeway Bay and Shau Kei Wan commenced in 1924. Enclosed double-decker trams with a new green livery were introduced in 1925, along with a waiting room for first-class passengers.

In 1927, sided indicators were fitted on tramcars, and in 1928, HKT commenced operation on island and Kowloon buses. The Shau Kei Wan loop was put into service in 1929. The North Point Depot was under construction in 1932 and completed in 1938. Refuge islands were introduced at some busy tram stops in 1934 to increase passenger safety. Tram fares were reduced in 1936 to compete with buses, and during Coronation week in 1937, a million ridership was carried. Air brakes were fitted on tramcars in 1939.

During the Japanese occupation in 1941, limited service was provided, with one single-decker used for freight transport. Service was suspended in 1944 due to a fuel shortage. After the occupation, only 15 tramcars were operational out of 112. By October 1945, 40 tramcars were back in daytime service only. Tram service gradually resumed, with flat fares of 20 cents for first class and 10 cents for third class. The relaying of double track at Causeway Bay began in 1948, and in 1949, Car 120, the first new design constructed by HKT, entered service. The last single-track was replaced by double-track, and annual ridership exceeded 100 million.

In 1950, HKT rebuilt the entire fleet in collaboration with Taikoo Dockyard. The Russell Street Depot was rebuilt and renamed Sharp Street Depot in 1951. The Causeway Bay loop was closed in 1953, and the new North Point terminus was put into use. The first official route map was printed for passengers in 1954, and the North Point Depot was closed in 1955. New resilient wheels from Sweden were introduced in 1956 to improve riding quality. By 1959, all cars had half-drop windows for the driver.

Tram service was suspended under typhoon Ellen in 1961. The first single-deck prototype trailer was introduced in 1964, and the first tram overturned accident occurred. In 1965, ten additional trailers were ordered from the UK, designed to serve first-class passengers only. Service was limited to North Point due to the gradient at Taikoo Hill. A trolley reverser was installed at Causeway Road for emergency purposes in 1966. The last trailer built by HKT was withdrawn in 1978.

In 1969, a few experimental liveries were tested on tramcars. Female conductors were introduced in 1971. Class distinction was abolished in 1972, and passengers boarded at the rear and paid as they left (PAYL). HKT was acquired by The Wharf (Holdings) in 1974. The first full-body adverts were applied on trams in 1975. Fareboxes were installed at each tram front exit, and rotating turnstiles were fitted at the rear entrance in 1976. Trams were operated in one-man-operation (OMO), and conductors were no longer needed and shifted to become motormen.

Tram no.163, rebuilt from trailer 1, entered service in 1979. Trailers were withdrawn from service in 1982. Route maps were introduced on tram stops in 1983. Car 12 was exported for Expo’ 86 in 1985. Tram refurbishment began in 1986, and the first tour tram No.28 was launched. The second tour tram No.128 was launched in 1987. The Sharp Street Depot was closed in 1989, and new depots were relocated at Whitty Street and Sai Wan Ho. Trial runs on overnight service began in 1990. A new built tram 120 replaced the 1949 prototype in 1991. Two HKT-built double-decker tramcars were exported to the Wirral Tramway in Birkenhead, England, in 1992. Points automation was introduced in place of points men’s cabins.

In 1993, HKT built two maximum traction bogies for testing. Testing of pantographs on trams began in 1994. Double platforms were introduced at the Happy Valley terminus in 1995. The final year of The Most Attractive Tram Ads Competition was in 1997. Coloured destination blinds were introduced in 1998. HKT launched new “Millennium” trams designed and manufactured by its own engineering team on October 24, 2000. The Octopus electronic smart card payment system was introduced on trams in 2001. HKT celebrated 100 years of service in 2004. Route maps were reinstalled at each tram stop, and new tram driving panels were introduced on November 7, 2007. Air conditioning was installed on tour tram 128 in 2008.

In 2009, a 50% stake and operating rights were obtained by Veolia Transport RATP Asia (now RATP Dev Transdev Asia), followed by full ownership in 2010. HKT launched Signature trams on November 28, 2011, featuring a combination of modern interior design and traditional outlook with LED displays, stops reporting, and AC motors. The “NexTram” passenger info system was launched in 2012. HKT proposed a modern light rail system for East Kowloon as a cheaper alternative to monorail in 2013. HKT celebrated 110 years of service in 2014. Following the opening of the West Island line of the MTR, daily tramway ridership dropped 10% to 180,000 in 2015. HKT provided real-time estimated time of arrival data to Citymapper in 2016, becoming the first transport operator in Hong Kong to do so. The first sightseeing car was launched in January, and the first air-conditioned car in June 2016.

In 2017, HKT rebranded with a new logo, new livery, and new map. The fourth party tram was launched in 2018. HKT celebrated 115 years of service with a series of events in 2019, including the introduction of the Bright Ring Tram. Day running lights were introduced on trams in 2020 for better night service, and Ding Ding Cat was employed as the tram ambassador. HKT achieved the Guinness World Record for the “Largest double-decker tram fleet in service” in 2021. A total of 10 fare free days were organized in 2022 with favorable responses, and new fares were applied on July 11. In 2024, HKT celebrated 120 years of service.

==Practical information==

*Fare – HK$3.00 (aged 12 or above), HK$1.5 (children aged 3 to 11/ general seniors aged 65 or above), HK$1.3 (elderly Hong Kong residents with JoyYou card aged 65 or above)
*Operating hours – 5:30 am to 12:30 am
*Total length – (Track length )

On average, the headway between each tram departure is approximately 1.5 minutes during peak hours. The maximum capacity of each tram is 115 people. Previously, the average tram speed was around . Since early 2008, the speed of the trams was increased. The tram&#x27;s general speed is currently around . Most of the trams have a maximum speed of more than , while some have a maximum speed of . Hong Kong people informally call the tramway the &quot;Ding Ding&quot; and the trams as &quot;Ding Dings&quot;, in reference to the double-bell ring used by the trams to warn pedestrians of their approach. Relative to buses and the subway system, trams are often the cheapest public transportation option.

===Fares===
As of 8th August 2024, HKT fares are HK$3.0 for adults, HK$1.5 for children and elderly, and HK$1.3 for HK JoyYou cardholder senior citizens. Unlike most forms of public transport in Hong Kong, HKT fares are uniform regardless of the distance travelled. There is also an option for monthly tickets, which cost HK$260 are sold at the Shek Tong Tsui, Causeway Bay, and North Point termini at the end of each month.

Passengers pay upon alighting by either depositing the exact fare in coins into the farebox, with a credit card (Visa, MasterCard, JCB and UnionPay), mobile wallet e.g. Apple Pay, Google Pay, Alipay or using an Octopus card. Turnstiles at the tram entrances and closed-circuit television are installed to prevent fare evasion by passengers.

===Tourist services===

Sightseeing tours are available on antique-style tramcar No. 68, which has an open balcony and a historical exhibit on board. Sightseeing tram boarding and alighting take place at the sightseeing tour termini: Western Market and Causeway Bay.

Standard tramcars and antique-style, open-balcony tramcars No. 18, No. 28, No. 68, and No. 128 are available for private charter. Charter tram boarding and alighting take place at Whitty Street Depot, except for premium charter tramcar No. 18; its boarding and alighting takes place at Western Market Terminus.

==Routes and stops==

The trams run on a double-track tram line built parallel to the northern coastline of Hong Kong Island from Kennedy Town to Shau Kei Wan, with a single clockwise-running track of about around the Happy Valley Racecourse.


There are six overlapping routes:
*Kennedy Town ↔ Happy Valley
*Kennedy Town ↔ Shau Kei Wan
*Shek Tong Tsui ↔ Causeway Bay
*Shek Tong Tsui ↔ North Point
*Western Market ↔ Shau Kei Wan
*Happy Valley ↔ Shau Kei Wan

HKT currently has around 120 tram stops, including its seven termini. The termini, from west to east, are Kennedy Town, Shek Tong Tsui, Western Market, Happy Valley, Causeway Bay, North Point, and Shau Kei Wan. The stops are densely located, with an average interval of between them. Several tram stops are located in the middle of the road on sheltered refugee islands, which are accessed by pedestrian crossings or footbridges. Track crossovers near the Davis Street, Eastern Street, Pedder Street, Admiralty MTR station, Gresson Street, Victoria Park, North Point Road, and Mount Parker Road stops are used in emergency situations, such as en-route traffic accidents. The majority of HKT stops have remained unchanged since their establishment, but some have had name changes. The Pedder Street stop was previously named &quot;Shu Shun Kwun&quot; (), which referred to a now-demolished former General Post Office building.

Most of the tram stops have dedicated platforms, albeit narrow, for passengers to wait for trams. However, 6 stops, namely Kennedy Town Praya, Hong Kong Cemetery, Wong Nai Chung Road, Nam Hong Street, Chai Wan Road, and the alighting stop of Shau Kei Wan Terminus, have no dedicated platforms and are instead located in the middle of the roadway. Passengers need to cross lanes for motor vehicles to board or alight from trams. Drivers of motor vehicles must stop behind the yellow &#x27;stop&#x27; line at such stations and give way to pedestrians crossing to or from the tram, and must wait until there are no more passengers getting on or off the tram.

===Interchanges===

The Island line of the MTR is roughly parallel to the tram line between the Kennedy Town and Shau Kei Wan termini. Some sections of MTR tunnels are built directly under roads with tram tracks. Many HKT stops are near MTR stations.

Ferry terminals can be accessed from the tram line via footbridges, such as the Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal and the Central Ferry Piers. The latter contains Star Ferry Pier, which is one of the stops for the Star Ferry.

==Fleet==
HKT has a rare fully double-decker tram fleet. As of 2014, HKT owned 165 double-axle, double-decker trams. There are three maintenance-only trams (No. 200, No. 300, and No. 400) that operate after regular tram service has stopped. The trams are equipped with sliding windows and almost all have full-body advertisements.
Note: Generally, there are no specific/official generation categories on tramcars. Many of the trams in one generation were simply modifications of the previous, such as open-balcony tramcars fitted with canvas roofs and then wooden roofs. The term &quot;generation&quot; should only apply to the new designs.

===Service fleet===
*Mitsubishi Fuso Canter overhead cable maintenance vehicle No. 6016.
*Temporary truck stand used for raising tram bodies and frames when trucks are removed for maintenance; it has small wheels that allow it to move around the depot.

==Depots==
===Current depots===

Whitty Street Depot, which opened on 27 May 1989 and is located in Shek Tong Tsui, is the main depot for current operations and trams overhaul. It previously operated as a terminus. When the Sharp Street Depot was closed in 1989, the site was expanded by . It has a two-storey workshop with capacity of over 100 trams.

Sai Wan Ho Depot opened on 28 April 1989 and occupies a site of leased from the government on a 5-year renewable tenancy. It lies beneath the Island Eastern Corridor near Shau Kei Wan Road and Hoi Foo Street. It has a capacity of over 60 trams and is for parking purpose only.

===Defunct depots===
A single, comprehensive depot at Russell Street in Causeway Bay was the only depot of the system from 1904. It was able to house the whole tram fleet (approximately 120 tramcars). By 1932, Russell Street Depot became overcrowded due to an upsurge in the number of trams, prompting HKT to build North Point Depot at King&#x27;s Road for tram parking purposes (storage for 30 tramcars). Russell Street Depot was later expanded and renamed &quot;Sharp Street Depot&quot;. North Point Depot closed in 1951; its former location is now the site of the Healthy Gardens complex. In July 1986, the Executive Council approved HKT&#x27;s plan to establish new depots at Shek Tong Tsui and Sai Wan Ho. HKT claimed that $3.5 million in operating costs would be saved. HKT promised that fares would be unchanged until the end of 1988. Sharp Street Depot was closed on 20 March 1989. The site is now occupied by the Times Square complex.

==Projects==
===Current projects===
In 2010, HKT appointed a consultancy firm to investigate the feasibility of constructing a modern tramway system in the Kai Tak Development, built on the vacated site of the former Kai Tak Airport, in place of the Environmentally Friendly Linkage System monorail proposed by the Hong Kong Government. A proposal was submitted to the Development Bureau on 29 April 2013. HKT pointed out that the cost of constructing the proposed tram system is $2.8 billion, which is less than the $12 billion needed for a monorail system. Possible extensions to neighbouring places such as To Kwa Wan, Kowloon City, and Kwun Tong were suggested. Bruno Charrade, managing director of HKT, said that the new system&#x27;s tramcars could be designed to resemble their Hong Kong Island counterparts or have a totally new design, depending on the government&#x27;s discretion.

Beginning in 2011, the entire HKT fleet will be refurbished over a period of seven years at a cost of $75 million HKD. The trams will keep their original exterior design, but the outer teak structures will be replaced with aluminium structures. The benches on the lower decks of the trams will be replaced with modern-looking single seats. Digital broadcasts will be placed inside the trams to inform passengers of the next stop, and LED lighting will be installed. AC motors will replace the current DC motors and a new magnetic emergency braking system will be added.

===Abandoned projects===
During the 1910s, HKT proposed the Kowloon Tramways Project. However, the completion of KCR Railway caused the government to veto the plan.

In 1970, Chai Wan on the east side of Hong Kong Island was developed into a residential and industrial area, which greatly increased traffic demand to Central. Extending the tram line from Shau Kei Wan to Chai Wan was considered, but was ultimately rejected. This was due to low cost effectiveness associated with the need to tunnel through the hills between Shau Kei Wan and Chai Wan to maintain level track. The Island line of the MTR was built instead, and its first phase, between Chai Wan and Admiralty, opened on 31 May 1985.

During the development of Tuen Mun New Town in the 1970s, the government reserved space for the construction of a rail transportation system. In 1982, the government invited HKT to construct and operate a tram system in the area. HKT initially expressed interest in the construction of the railway and intended to operate it with double-decker trams, but later withdrew. The government then invited Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation to construct and operate a light rail system. That system, now known as the Light Rail, opened to the public on 18 September 1988.

==April 2017 accident==
During the early hours of Thursday, 6 April 2017, a tram tipped over in Central, injuring 14 people. Soon after, it was suggested that the tram was travelling too fast into a turn. The driver was later arrested for allegedly causing grievous bodily harm due to dangerous driving. Two days later, it was reported that HKT suspended a speed monitoring programme intended to discourage drivers from travelling too slowly.

<doc id="267239" wikidata="Q17541" url="?curid=267239" title="Victoria Peak">
<text>Victoria Peak is a hill on the western half of Hong Kong Island. It is also known as Mount Austin, and locally as The Peak only generally. With an elevation of , it is the tallest hill on Hong Kong Island, and the 29th tallest in the territory of Hong Kong. It is a major tourist attraction offering views of Central, Victoria Harbour, Lamma Island and the surrounding islands.

The summit of Victoria Peak is occupied by a radio telecommunications facility and is closed to the public. The surrounding area of public parks, tourist facilities and high-value residential land is the area that is normally meant by the name &quot;The Peak&quot;. &quot;The Peak&quot; also refers to Victoria Peak itself and its nearby areas, including Victoria Gap, Mount Kellett and Mount Gough. Sometimes Bowen Hill may also be included.

The Peak is also known as a residential area consisting of different neighbourhoods including the less affluent Mount Kellett which faces Southside. It is one of the most expensive residential areas in Hong Kong and internationally.

==History of Victoria Peak==

As early as the 19th century, the Peak attracted prominent European residents because of its panoramic view over the city and its temperate climate compared to the sub-tropical climate in the rest of Hong Kong. The sixth Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Richard MacDonnell had a summer residence built on the Peak circa 1868. Those that built houses named them whimsically, such as The Eyrie, and the Austin Arms.

These original residents reached their homes by sedan chairs, which were carried up and down the steep slope of Victoria Peak. This limited development of the Peak until the opening of the Peak Tram funicular in 1888.

The boost to accessibility caused by the opening of the Peak Tram created demand for residences on the Peak. Between 1904 and 1930, the Peak Reservation Ordinance designated the Peak as an exclusive residential area reserved for non-Chinese. They also reserved the Peak Tram for the use of such passengers during peak periods. The Peak remains an upmarket residential area, although residency today is based on wealth.

In 1905, construction of the Pinewood Battery was completed on the western side of the Peak. Harlech Road was constructed around the Peak as a means of resupply to this artillery and later anti-aircraft battery.

During 1904 and 1947, Chinese people were not allowed to live on the Peak according to the Peak District Reservation Ordinance when Hong Kong was a colony. In the 1920s Robert Hotung was the first Chinese person to live on the Peak because at the time he was considered mixed-race. Ho Tung Gardens located at 75 Peak Road, was owned by Robert Hotung for decades, until it was sold in 2015 for HK$5.1 billion or HK$82,258 per sq.ft., a price which was below single lot houses in Jardine&#x27;s Lookout.

Historically, apart from houses owned by the government, banks and corporations and lived on by their officials and chairmen, the Peak also had some multi-block estates, with medium-sized flats used as housing for more junior staff. These are located on less prestigious streets, such as Guildford Road and Mount Kellett Road, which face Southside instead of Victoria Harbour.

In November 1996 businessman Wong Yuk Kwan paid HK$540 million for a house at 23 Severn Road called &#x27;Genesis,&#x27; which was built in the 1980s by Heung Chi-kau. Another house Wong bought was 10-18 Pollock&#x27;s Path, known as &#x27;Skyhigh.&#x27; Owned by HSBC and lived in by the bank&#x27;s Chairmen, Skyhigh was sold to Kazuo Wada, the president of Yaohan, for HK$85 million in early 1990s. Because Yaohan went bankrupt, Kazuo Wada sold to businessman Wong Yuk Kwan for HK$370 million. In 2004, after SARS, actor Stephen Chow bought Skyhigh, and brought in Ryoden Development as a joint venture partner to rebuild the land into four houses. Genesis was sold by creditors in 2001 for HK$240m, less than 50% of what Wong Kwan paid.

These property transactions at the Peak were desperate sales by cash-strapped businessmen during crisis of different economic cycles.

== Changes in neighbourhood ==
Some large houses on The Peak with historic values, including homes of consulates, and government buildings were demolished over the decades and redeveloped into smaller houses within managed complexes. In 2006, Sun Hung Kai Properties paid HK$1.8b, or 42,196 per sq.ft. through a government auction for a plot at 12 Mount Kellett Road, where there were blocks of flats as housing for medium-grade officials. In 2022, a house at the complex &#x27;Twelve Peaks&#x27; at 12 Mount Kellett Road was sold by the creditors of HNA Chairman Chen Feng, whose business in mainland China was bankrupt, for HK$390m, or HK$91,959 per sq. ft. Chen Feng paid HK$506m in 2016 or HK$119,323 per sq.ft.

Despite record-breaking transactions reported by international news from the 1990s until 2010s, In fact, The Peak is not the most expensive residential area in Hong Kong. Deep Water Bay and Jardine&#x27;s Lookout are also one of the most expensive residential areas. A house at 75 Deep Water Bay Road, near Li Ka-shing&#x27;s home, was sold by Pan Sutong for HK$3.3b, or HK$240,000 per sq.ft., Cheung Chung-kiu, Chairman of CC Land, purchased 1 Purves Road, Jardine&#x27;s Lookout for about HK$760 million, or around HK$100,000 per square foot. In 2018, a site on Perkins Road, Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, was sold for HK$145,000 per sq.ft. Transactions of these two houses that do not face harbour views indicate a few with harbour views in Jardine&#x27;s Lookout are valued at 

Another benchmark for measuring values is the annual published figures by the government&#x27;s rating and valuation department, based on estimated rental values, although such properties are not rented out to third parties. Figures published in 2021 included 35 Barker Road, owned by Lee Shau-kee, to be among the top five most valuable houses. However, 35 Barker Road consists of three houses, and so it should not be compared to other houses.

The Peak has a diverse mix of apartment buildings and houses of different sizes and quality, and as a tourist destination, also has hospitals, schools and malls.  Many properties are also owned for rental purposes typically occupied by expatriate. The Mount Austin is a complex owned by Nan Fung Group with apartments of sizes ranging from 696 sq.ft. Plantation Road has a property with many purpose-built blocks for rent, temporary staff housing of small units and facilities for staff.

Barker Road is one of the most desirable streets because it is located below the level where harbour views are affected during foggy seasons. In 2010, Lee Shau Kee, Chairman of Henderson Land Development, bought a site at 35 Barker Road for HK$1.82b and rebuilt into three houses as his family&#x27;s dwellings after originally living in a penthouse on Mid-levels. In 2015, Alibaba&#x27;s founder Jack Ma bought a house on Barker Road for HK$1.5b or HK$150,000 per sq.ft.

In 2020, developer The Wharf (Holdings) bought a plot at Mansfield Road on the Peak for HK$12b or HK$46,300 per sq. ft. through government auction. This site is one of the last plots of sites owned by the Hong Kong Government used previously as accommodation for civil servants.

In July 2024, the owner of 46 Plantation Road sold four houses with the plot for HK$11 billion which represented around HK$65,000 per sq.ft. The property faces Victoria Harbour on a long road that has many properties of different types. The price per sq.ft. represents a decrease of around 50% compared to the level in the late-2010s. In August 2024, the same former owner of 46 Plantation Road sold another plot at 99 Peak Road with three houses at HK$860 million which represented below HK$60,000 per sq.ft. 

Individual lots on the Peak are different than those of areas like Deep Water Bay and Jardine&#x27;s Lookout, where both single family houses and multi-family blocks of flats can be constructed so long as the maximum plot ratio is 0.5. This provides flexibility for newer owners like Jack Ma and developer CSI who developed no. 22 and no. 47 Barker Road respectively using multi-family flats. Buildings Department permit exempted areas for such owners, outside of plot ratio, to accommodate shared facilities like club houses. As a result, the maximum useable area can be substantially increased thereby making price per square feet of the Peak artificially higher than comparable areas. This also creates a mix of single houses and apartment blocks on same streets or neighbourhoods, which can be perceived as less exclusive.

==Ecology==
The Peak is home to many species of birds, most prominently the black kite, and numerous species of butterflies. Wild boar and porcupines are also seen on Peak, along with a variety of snakes.

==Tourism==
With some seven million visitors every year, the Peak is a major tourist attraction of Hong Kong. It has views of the city and its waterfront. The viewing deck also has coin-operated telescopes that the visitors can use to enjoy the cityscape. The number of visitors led to the construction of two major leisure and shopping centres, the Peak Tower and the Peak Galleria, situated adjacent to each other.

The Peak Tower incorporates the upper station of the Peak Tram, the funicular railway that brings passengers up from the St. John&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral in Hong Kong&#x27;s Central district, whilst the Peak Galleria incorporates the bus station used by the Hong Kong public buses and green minibuses on the Peak. The Peak is also accessible by taxi and private car via the circuitous Peak Road, or by walking up the steep Old Peak Road from near the Zoological Botanical Gardens or the Central Green Trail from Hong Kong Park. The nearest MTR station is Central.

Victoria Peak Garden is located on the site of Mountain Lodge, the Governor&#x27;s old summer residence, and is the closest publicly accessible point to the summit. It can be reached from Victoria Gap by walking up Mount Austin Road, a climb of about . Another popular walk is the level loop along Lugard and Harlech Roads, giving good views of the entire Hong Kong Harbour and Kowloon, as well as Lantau and Lamma Islands, encircling the summit at the level of the Peak Tower.

There are several restaurants on Victoria Peak, most of which are located in the two shopping centres. However, the Peak Lookout Restaurant, is housed in an older and more traditional building which was originally a spacious house for engineers working on the Peak Tramway. It was rebuilt in 1901 as a stop area for sedan chairs, but was re-opened as a restaurant in 1947.

==Official residences in Victoria Peak==
The Peak is home to a few other key officials in Hong Kong:
* 19 Severn Road – residence of the Secretary for Justice
* Victoria House and Victoria Flats at 15 Barker Road – residence of the Chief Secretary for Administration
* Headquarters House 11 Barker Road – residence of the Commander of PLA Forces in Hong Kong and former home of the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces
* Chief Justice&#x27;s House 18 Gough Hill Road – residence of the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal

==Education==
Victoria Peak is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 11. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and the following government schools: Bonham Road Government Primary School and (李陞小學).

German Swiss International School maintains a campus on Victoria Peak.

<text>This is a list of newspapers in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is home to many of Asia&#x27;s biggest English and Chinese language newspapers. The territory has one of the world&#x27;s largest press industries and is a major centre for print journalism.

==Overview==
===Popularity===
The Chinese language newspapers &quot;Headline Daily&quot; and &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot; have the highest shares in the Hong Kong newspaper market, while the &quot;Hong Kong Economic Times&quot; is the best-selling financial newspaper. &quot;The Standard&quot;, a free tabloid with a mass market strategy, is the most widely circulated English newspaper by a significant margin. Its rival, &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, has the most paid subscribers among English-language papers in Hong Kong.

&quot;Apple Daily&quot; had one of the highest circulations before its closure in 2021. It had a feisty, tabloid style, concentrating on celebrity gossip and paparazzi photography, with sensationalist news reportage and a noted anti-government political position. The Chinese language publications were written to some degree with colloquial Cantonese phrases.

===Media landscape and pricing===
The number of newspapers in the market has been stable for a long time. Occasional attempts to establish new types of newspaper and themed papers generally cannot compete with the established brands. However, the entry into the market of free newspapers &quot;Metropolis Daily&quot;, &quot;Headline Daily&quot;, &quot;am730&quot;, and &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; spurred competition. In September 2007, &quot;The Standard&quot; changed its business model from a traditional daily into a free-sheet, distributed in commercial districts like Central and Admiralty.

Most papers sell at a cover price of HK$9-10, except &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; (HK$9, while the Sunday edition, &quot;Sunday Morning Post&quot;, costs HK$10). The economic recession brought about by SARS in 2003 led to some resellers pricing at $1 below the recommended price. According to the HK Newspaper Hawkers Association, the situation lasted through to 2008, when around 10% of sellers maintained the cut price despite the change in the prevailing economic climate. The Association urged a return to resale price maintenance.

==Chinese-language newspapers==
Newspapers in Hong Kong are considered to follow a particular political stance, with most being either pro-Beijing or pro-democracy. A few are neutral, or are oriented towards finance or religion. There has long been a lively tabloid sector, including &quot;Oriental Daily&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot; and (formerly) &quot;Apple Daily&quot;.

==English-language newspapers==
Hong Kong is also the base of regional editions of foreign English-language newspapers. &quot;The New York Times International Edition&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot; are published in Hong Kong.

From 10 September 2007, &quot;The Standard&quot; switched to free, advertising-supported distribution. &quot;The South China Morning Post&quot; announced on 11 December 2015 that the Alibaba Group would acquire the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; from Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok, who had owned it since 1993. As of 5 April 2016, the South China Morning Post&#x27;s online content became free to read.

<doc id="267247" wikidata="Q22312407" url="?curid=267247" title="River dolphin">
<text>River dolphins are a polyphyletic group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which itself is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. Extant river dolphins are placed in two superfamilies, Platanistoidea and Inioidea. They comprise the families Platanistidae (the South Asian dolphins), the possibly extinct Lipotidae (Yangtze River dolphin), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins) and Pontoporiidae. There are five extant species of river dolphins. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Artiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, from which they diverged about 40 million years ago. Specific types of dolphins can be pink.

River dolphins are relatively small compared to other dolphins, having evolved to survive in warm, shallow water and strong river currents. They range in size from the long South Asian river dolphin to the and Amazon river dolphin. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than the males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. River dolphins use their conical-shaped teeth and long beaks to capture fast-moving prey in murky water. They have well-developed hearing that is adapted for both air and water; they do not really rely on vision since the water they swim in is usually very muddy. Instead, they tend to rely on echolocation when hunting and navigating. These species are well-adapted to living in warm, shallow waters, and, unlike other cetaceans, have little to no blubber.

River dolphins are not very widely distributed; they are all restricted to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction. River dolphins feed primarily on fish. Male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.

River dolphins are rarely kept in captivity; breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. , there was only one river dolphin in captivity.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

===Classification===

Four families of river dolphins (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, is the only living family in the superfamily Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated the Ganges and Indus river dolphins as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of &quot;Lipotes vexillifer&quot; (commonly known as the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct.

The current classification of river dolphins is as follows:

* Superfamily Platanistoidea
** Family Platanistidae
*** Genus &quot;Platanista&quot;
**** South Asian river dolphin, &quot;Platanista gangetica&quot;, with two subspecies
***** Ganges river dolphin (&quot;susu&quot;), &quot;P. g. gangetica&quot;
***** Indus river dolphin (&quot;bhulan&quot;), &quot;P. g. minor&quot;
** Family †Allodelphinidae (Oligocene - Miocene)
** Family †Squalodelphinidae (Oligocene to Miocene)
** Family †Squalodontidae (Oligocene to Miocene)
** Family †Waipatiidae (Oligocene to Miocene)
* Superfamily Inioidea
** Family Iniidae
*** Genus &quot;Inia&quot;
**** Amazon river dolphin (&quot;boto&quot;), &quot;Inia geoffrensis&quot;
***** &quot;Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis&quot;
***** &quot;Inia geoffrensis humbotiana&quot;
**** Araguaian river dolphin, &quot;Inia araguaiaensis&quot;
**** Bolivian river dolphin, &quot;Inia boliviensis&quot;
*** Genus †&quot;Meherrinia&quot; (late Miocene)
*** Genus †&quot;Isthminia&quot; (Miocene)
** Family Pontoporiidae
*** Genus †&quot;Auroracetus&quot;
**** †&quot;Auroracetus bakerae&quot;
*** Genus &quot;Pontoporia&quot;
**** La Plata dolphin (&quot;Franciscana&quot;), &quot;Pontoporia blainvillei&quot;
* Superfamily Lipotoidea
** Family Lipotidae
*** Genus &quot;Lipotes&quot;
*** &quot;Baiji&quot; (or Chinese river dolphin), &quot;Lipotes vexillifer&quot;

In 2012 the Society for Marine Mammalogy began considering the Bolivian (&quot;Inia geoffrensis boliviensis&quot;) and Amazonian (&quot;Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis&quot;) subspecies as full species &quot;Inia boliviensis&quot; and &quot;Inia geoffrensis&quot;, respectively; however, much of the scientific community, including the IUCN, continue to consider the Bolivian population to be a subspecies of &quot;Inia geoffrensis&quot;.

In October 2014, the Society for Marine Mammalogy took &quot;Inia boliviensis&quot; and &quot;Inia araguaiaensis&quot; off their list of aquatic mammal species and subspecies and currently does not recognize these species-level separations.

===Evolution===
River dolphins are members of the infraorder Cetacea, which are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the &quot;Indohyus&quot;, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.
The primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5–10 million years later. It is unknown when river dolphins first ventured back into fresh water.

River dolphins are thought to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is polyphyletic. Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins. &quot;Isthminia panamensis&quot; is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Piña, Panama.

River dolphin has been considered a taxonomic description, suggesting an evolutionary relationship among the group, although it is now known that they form two distinct clades. &#x27;True&#x27; river dolphins are descendants of ancient evolutionary lineages that evolved in freshwater environments.

Some species of cetacean live in rivers and lakes, but are more closely related to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, &quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise &quot;Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis&quot;. Some oceanic cetacean populations are known to live semi-permanently in river and estuarine systems, such as the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin group resident in the Swan River of Western Australia which travel as far inland as Belmont.

The tucuxi (&quot;Sotalia fluviatilis&quot;) in the Amazon River is another species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, it does not perfectly fit the label of &#x27;facultative&#x27; either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (&quot;Sotalia guianensis&quot;), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that, although the species may be found in both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers may not be able to survive in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).

The Franciscana (&quot;Pontoporia blainvillei&quot;) has shown a converse evolutionary pattern, and has an ancient evolutionary lineage in freshwater, but inhabits estuarine and coastal waters.

==Biology==

===Anatomy===
River dolphins have a torpedo shaped body with a flexible neck, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a tail fin, and a small bulbous head. River dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, a long snout and eyes placed on the sides of the head. River dolphins are rather small, ranging in size from the long South Asian river dolphin to the and Amazon river dolphin. They all have female-biased sexual dimorphism apart from Amazon river dolphin, with the females being larger than the males. River dolphins are polygynous, meaning male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them.

River dolphins have conical teeth, used to catch swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four times longer than most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They do not have the iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.

River dolphins have a relatively thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.

===Locomotion===

River dolphins have two flippers and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although river dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. River dolphins are slow swimmers in comparison to oceanic dolphins, which can travel at speeds up to ; the tucuxi can only travel at about . Unlike other cetaceans, their neck vertebrae are not fused together, meaning they have greater flexibility than other non-terrestrial aquatic mammals, at the expense of speed. This means they can turn their head without actually moving their entire body. When swimming, river dolphins rely on their tail fins to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. River dolphins swim by moving their tail fins and lower bodies up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. All species have a dorsal fin.

===Senses===

The ears of river dolphins have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air&#x27;s low impedance and the cochlear fluid&#x27;s high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive even if they are blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object&#x27;s shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.

River dolphins have very small eyes for their size, and do not have a very good sense of sight. In addition, the eyes are placed on the sides of the head, so the vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When river dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light. They have both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Most river dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on their eyelids and an outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.

Olfactory lobes are absent in river dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.

River dolphins are not thought to have a sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some dolphins have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.

==Interactions with humans==

===Threats===

====Development====
Development and agriculture have had devastating impacts on the habitats on river dolphins. The total population of Araguaian river dolphins is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500 individuals, and genetic diversity is limited. The ecology of their habitat has been adversely affected by agricultural, ranching and industrial activities, as well as by the use of dams for hydroelectric power. The inhabited section of the Araguaia River probably extends over about out of a total length of . The Tocantins river habitat is fragmented by six hydroelectric dams, so the population there is at particular risk. Its probable eventual IUCN status is vulnerable or worse.

Both subspecies of South Asian river dolphins have been very adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies&#x27; ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.

As China developed economically, pressure on the baiji river dolphin grew significantly. Industrial and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze. The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations. Ship traffic multiplied, boats grew in size, and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets. Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers. Stocks of the dolphin&#x27;s prey declined drastically in the late 20th century, with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre-industrial levels. In the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals, but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. On December 13, 2006, the baiji (&quot;Lipotes vexillifer&quot;) was declared &quot;functionally extinct&quot;, after a 45-day search by leading experts in the field failed to find a single specimen. The last verified and widely accepted sighting was in September 2004, but it has been allegedly seen and photographed by Chinese citizens on four occasions since then.

====Competition====

The region of the Amazon in Brazil has an extension of containing diverse fundamental ecosystems. One of these ecosystems is a floodplain, or a várzea forest, and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption. The várzea is also a major source of income through excessive local commercialized fishing. Várzea consist of muddy river waters containing a vast number and diversity of nutrient-rich species. The abundance of distinct fish species lures the Amazon River dolphin into the várzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding.

In addition to attracting predators such as the Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (&quot;Colossoma macropomum&quot;) and the pirapitinga (&quot;Piaractus brachypomus&quot;), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon river dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.
 The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources prohibit fishermen from killing the Amazon river dolphin, yet they are not compensated for the damage to their equipment and the loss of their catch.

====Bycatch====
During the process of catching the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins get caught in the nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (&quot;Calophysus macropterus&quot;). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.

For example, of the 15 dolphin carcasses found in the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because a variety of factors make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.

===Conservation===

The &quot;Global Declaration for River Dolphins&quot; was signed by nine countries on 24 October 2023, a date chosen as it is known as the International River Dolphin Day. This pact is intended to promote research and cooperation between countries with river dolphin populations. It is hoped that five further countries will join.

===In captivity===

A baiji conservation dolphinarium was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large, only kidney shaped tanks with dimensions of arc width and depth, diameter, deep and diameter, deep, and are not capable of holding many baijis at one time.
Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme &quot;Last Chance to See&quot;. The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (淇淇) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (白鱀豚水族馆) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian-e-Zhou Baiji Semi-natural Reserve (石首半自然白鱀豚保护区), which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990, was flooded.

The Amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums. Today, only three exist in captivity: one in Acuario de Valencia in Venezuela, one in Zoologico de Guistochoca in Peru, and one in Duisburg Zoo in Germany. Several hundred were captured between the 1950s and 1970s, and were distributed in dolphinariums throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. Around 100 went to US dolphinariums, and of that, only 20 survived; the last (named Chuckles) died in Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002.

===In mythology===
==== Asia ====
In Hindu mythology, the Ganges river dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river. The dolphin is said to be one of the creatures which heralded the goddess&#x27; descent from the heavens, and Ganga&#x27;s mount, the Makara, is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.

In Chinese mythology, the baiji has many origin stories.
For example, near the mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her stepfather, whom she had longed to get away from. The stepfather wanted to trade her since she would be sold for a great sum of money, but as they were crossing the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in. The enraged stepfather tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river, was transformed into a dolphin before she drowned, and swam away from her abusive stepfather, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.

In another story, the baiji was the daughter of a general deported from the city of Wuhan during a war who ran away while her father was in duty. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general. When he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame, and his daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin and the general into a porpoise.

==== South America ====
Amazon river dolphins, known by the natives as the boto, encantados or toninhas, are very prevalent in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in mythology with superior musical ability, seductiveness and love of sex that often results in illegitimate children, and attraction to parties. Despite the fact that the Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.

Transformation into human form is said to be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not disappear with the shapeshift.

Besides the ability to shapeshift into human form, encantados frequently wield other magical abilities, such as controlling storms, hypnotizing humans into doing their will, transforming humans into encantados, and inflicting illness, insanity, and even death. Shamans often intervene in these situations.

Kidnapping is also a common theme in such folklore. Encantados are said to be fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, children born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among people who live near the Amazon River that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, but the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.

<text>Gavialinae is a subfamily of large semiaquatic crocodilian reptiles, resembling crocodiles, but with much thinner snouts. Gavialinae is one of the two major subfamilies within the family Gavialidae - the other being the subfamily Tomistominae, which contains the false gharial and extinct relatives.

==Classification==
Gavialinae was first proposed by Nopcsa in 1923, and was cladistically defined by Brochu in 2003 as &quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot; (the gharial) and all crocodylians more closely related to it than to &quot;Tomistoma schlegelii&quot; (the false gharial). This is a stem-based definition for gavialinae, and means that it includes more basal extinct gavialine ancestors that are more closely related to the gharial than to the false gharial.

The false gharial was once thought to be only distantly related to the gharial despite its similar appearance. The false gharial and other tomistomines were traditionally classified within the superfamily Crocodyloidea as close relatives of crocodiles, based solely on morphological evidence. However, recent molecular studies using DNA sequencing have found that they are in fact more closely related to each other than any other extant (living) crocodilian.

The placement of extinct gavialids between Gavialinae and Tomistominae is unresolved.

The below cladogram is from the 2022 Iijima &quot;et al.&quot; study:

<text>Gavialidae is a family of large semiaquatic crocodilians with elongated, narrow snouts. Gavialidae consists of two living species, the gharial (&quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot;) and the false gharial (&quot;Tomistoma schlegelii&quot;), both occurring in Asia. Many extinct members are known from a broader range, including the recently extinct &quot;Hanyusuchus&quot;. Gavialids are generally regarded as lacking the jaw strength to capture the large mammalian prey favoured by crocodiles and alligators of similar size so their thin snout is best used to catch fish, however the false gharial has been found to have a generalist diet with mature adults preying upon larger vertebrates, such as ungulates.

==Taxonomy==
The family Gavialidae was proposed by Arthur Adams in 1854 for reptiles with a very long and slender muzzle, webbed feet and nearly equal teeth. It is currently recognized as a crown group, meaning that it only includes the last common ancestor of all extant (living) gavialids (the gharial and false gharial) and their descendants (living or extinct).

Traditionally, crocodiles and alligators were considered more closely related and grouped together in the clade Brevirostres, to the exclusion of the gharials. This classification was based on morphological studies primarily focused on analyzing skeletal traits of living and extinct fossil species. However, recent molecular studies using DNA sequencing have rejected Brevirostres upon finding the crocodiles and gavialids to be more closely related than the alligators. The new clade Longirostres was named by Harshman &quot;et al.&quot; in 2003.

In addition, these recent molecular DNA studies consistently indicate that the false gharial (&quot;Tomistoma&quot;) (and by inference other related extinct forms) traditionally viewed as belonging to the crocodylian subfamily Tomistominae actually belong to Gavialoidea (and Gavialidae). As its name suggests, the false gharial was once thought to be only distantly related to the gharial despite its similar appearance. The false gharial and other tomistomines were traditionally classified within the superfamily Crocodyloidea as close relatives of crocodiles, based solely on morphological evidence.

A 2018 tip dating study by Lee &amp; Yates simultaneously using morphological, molecular (DNA sequencing), and stratigraphic (fossil age) data established the inter-relationships within Crocodilia, which was expanded upon in 2021 by Hekkala &quot;et al.&quot; using paleogenomics by extracting DNA from the extinct &quot;Voay&quot;. The tip dating analysis resolved the extinct &quot;Thoracosaurus&quot; and similar extinct close relatives (&quot;thoracosaurs&quot;) as outside of Gavialoidea due to the large time difference. They concluded that the only possible explanation for the morphological data placing thoracosaurs within the gharial lineage was a significant amount of homoplastic convergence between thoracosaurs and &quot;Gavialis&quot;.

The below cladogram from latest study shows Gavialidae&#x27;s placement within Crocodylia:

<doc id="267267" wikidata="Q622597" url="?curid=267267" title="La Plata dolphin">
<text>The La Plata dolphin, franciscana or toninha (Pontoporia blainvillei) is a species of river dolphin found in coastal Atlantic waters of southeastern South America. It is a member of the Inioidea group and the only one that lives in the ocean and saltwater estuaries, rather than inhabiting exclusively freshwater systems. Commercialized areas that create agricultural runoffs and industrialized zones can affect the health of the La Plata dolphin, especially in regards to their contributions of waste and pollution, which can lead to habitat degradation and poisoned food among other concerns. 

==Taxonomy==

The La Plata dolphin is the only species in its genus, Pontoporia, and is often placed in its own family, Pontoporiidae. It was first described by Paul Gervais and Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny in 1844 (the species epithet &quot;blainvillei&quot; commemorates the French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville). The La Plata dolphin is also widely known as the &quot;Franciscana&quot; (the Argentine and Uruguayan name), a name that has been adopted internationally. Other common names are the &quot;toninha&quot; (the Brazilian name) and &quot;cachimbo&quot;.

==Description==

The La Plata dolphin has the longest beak (as a proportion of body size) of any extant cetacean — as much as 15% in older adults. Males grow to and females to . The body is a greyish brown colour, with a lighter underside. The flippers are also very large in comparison with body size and are very broad, but narrow on joining the body, so are almost triangular in shape. The trailing edges are serrated. The crescent-shaped blowhole lies just in front of a crease in the neck, giving the impression that dolphin forever has its head cricked upwards. The dorsal fin has a long base and a rounded tip. The La Plata dolphin has homodont dentition with conical-shaped teeth. The number of teeth ranges from 48 to 61 on each side of its upper and lower jaw.

The La Plata dolphin weighs up to , and lives for up to 20 years. Sexual maturity is reached between two and three years. Females have a two-year reproductive cycle. Calves are 70 to 75 cm when born after a gestation of 10–11 months. Calves are weaned at a year old. Females may be giving birth by the age of five.

== Reproduction ==
The La Plata dolphin reaches sexual maturity around two to three years for both sexes, but some populations have shown as long as five years. Although it is difficult to observe La Plata dolphins, the reproductive patterns of one population of La Plata near Brazil was studied extensively. A majority of the dolphins observed were born around September to February, during the austral spring and summer. La Plata dolphin has an average gestation period of about 11 months.

Smaller testes indicate less importance of sperm competition when considering mating strategies, and La Plata dolphins generally have smaller testes. However, data reveals that the size of an individual&#x27;s testes has seasonal variation which indicates their breeding season, but there is still research needed to further this observation. The size of La Plata testes in relation to their body mass may reveal that they primarily perform serial monogamy. This does not directly indicate that La Plata are purely monogamous, but that they may remain with one partner during a breeding season or a portion of that season.

There is evidence that suggests that La Plata have a reproductive cycle of two years; however, more is required to make any legitimate claims.

==Behavior and feeding==
The animal is very inconspicuous—it moves very smoothly and slowly—and can be difficult to spot unless estuary conditions are very calm. It will commonly swim alone or in small groups. Exceptional groups as large as 15 have been seen. La Plata dolphins are bottom feeders and gut inspections have revealed they eat at least 24 different species of fish, depending on which species are most common. They will also take octopus, squid and shrimp. They are, in turn, hunted by killer whales (orcas) and several species of sharks.

==Range and habitat==

The La Plata dolphin is found in the coastal Atlantic waters of southeastern South America, including the Río de la Plata estuary. Its distribution ranges from the Tropic of Capricorn near Ubatuba, Brazil, south to Península Valdés, Argentina. It is the only member of the river dolphin group that lives in the ocean and saltwater estuaries, rather than freshwater. Although some members of the species do spend portions of their lives outside of river systems, many individuals live their entire lives within rivers, never venturing into the ocean proper.

The species has been observed in Miramar, Buenos Aires Province, Rio Negro Province, Bahia Rosas swimming in small groups. Their reported range is from the opening of the Doce River, Regencia, Espirito Santo, Brasil to Peninsula Valdes in Chubut Province, Argentina.

When along the Brazilian coast, the species is usually reported in depths ranging from 8 to 30 meters, and up to 35 for accidental captures. However, there are a few reports of individual further away from the shore.

== Threats ==

The La Plata dolphin is affected by factors like habitat destruction and water pollution. Plastic debris and synthetic material has been found in the stomach contents of these animals. More research is necessary to determine whether or not these factors negatively affect the health of La Plata dolphins. 90% of the population in Guanabara Bay was lost in three decades. La Plata also faces threats from fishing nets and other types of fishing gear that they get caught in while searching for prey.

Commercialized areas often have agricultural runoff or industrial zones that are harmful to the species&#x27;s health. Waste and pollution from these areas lead to habitat degradation and toxic chemicals in fish that dolphins feed on.

Since the La Plata dolphin is a small mammal and their habitat is regularly hunted by sharks and killer whales, they are generally quiet in nature and inhabit shallow coastal waters.

==Conservation==
The La Plata dolphin is listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot; in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the &quot;Franciscana&quot; is a particular conservation concern because of its restricted distribution and vulnerability to incidental capture in fishing gear. Large numbers are killed in gillnets. Although the largest documented catches in the 1970s were in Uruguay, catches in recent decades have also been high in southern Brazil and Argentina. Scientists from all three countries have voiced their concerns, and asked for international assistance in highlighting the plight of the dolphin (see Reeves et al., pg. 53).

The species is listed on Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of its range. CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. It is listed on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

A young La Plata dolphin was rescued in 2011 off Montevideo, Uruguay. In February 2016 a young dolphin died on the beach of Santa Teresita, Argentina. Reports circulated internationally that the dolphin&#x27;s death resulted after being passed around by a crowd who were posing for selfies with it. However, an interview by the photographer of the images, Hernan Coria, contradicted such claim.

<text>South Asian river dolphins are toothed whales in the genus Platanista, which inhabit the waterways of the Indian subcontinent. They were historically considered to be one species (&quot;P. gangetica&quot;) with the Ganges river dolphin and the Indus river dolphin being subspecies (&quot;P. g. gangetica&quot; and &quot;P. g. minor&quot; respectively). Genetic and morphological evidence led to their being described as separate species in 2021. The Ganges and Indus river dolphins are estimated to have diverged 550,000 years ago. They are the only living members of the family Platanistidae and the superfamily Platanistoidea. Fossils of ancient relatives date to the late Oligocene. 

South Asian river dolphins are small but stocky cetaceans with long snouts or rostra, broad flippers, and small dorsal fins. They have several unusual features. Living in murky river waters, they have eyes that are tiny and lensless; the dolphins rely instead on echolocation for navigation. The skull has large crests over the melon, which help direct their echolocation signals. These dolphins prey mainly on fish and shrimp and hunt them throughout the water column. They are active through the day and are sighted in small groups. Both species are listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List of mammals. Major threats include dams, barrages, fishing nets, and both chemical and acoustic pollution.

==Taxonomy==
South Asian river dolphins were traditionally considered to be one species, &quot;Platanista gangetica&quot;, with the Ganges and Indus River populations being subspecies (&quot;P. g. gangetica&quot; and &quot;P. g. minor&quot;, respectively). Heinrich Julius Lebeck named the Ganges river dolphin &quot;Delphinus gangeticus&quot; in 1801, while Johann Georg Wagler coined the genus name &quot;Platanista&quot; in 1830, a Latin word derived from the Greek &quot;platanistēs&quot;, which may be related to the Greek words platē (&quot;oar&quot;) or platē (&quot;flat, broad&quot;). This name was first given to the Ganges dolphin by Pliny the Elder in &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; back in 77 CE. In 1853, Richard Owen described a specimen from the Indus and considered it to be the same species as the Ganges river dolphin, but a smaller form.

Based on differences in skull and vertebrae structure, blood proteins, and lipids, scientists declared them to be separate species in the 1970s. The results of these studies were criticized for their small sample sizes and the absence of statistical analyses; by the late 1990s, the two populations were again considered to be two subspecies of a single species. A 2014 mitochondrial DNA study found insufficient differences to support their classification as separate species. However, a 2021 study reanalyzed the two populations and found significant genetic divergence and major differences in skull structure; this led to the conclusion that the two were indeed distinct species.

===Evolution===
South Asian river dolphins are the only surviving members of the family Platanistidae and the superfamily Platanistoidea. They are not closely related to other river dolphins of the families Lipotidae, Pontoporiidae, and Iniidae, which all independently adapted to freshwater habitats. The following cladogram is based on Gatesy and colleagues (2012) and McGowen and colleagues (2020); and shows the relationship of South Asian river dolphins to other living toothed whale families:

Several fossil species have been classified under Platanistoidea, the earliest of which date back to the late Oligocene ( million years ago). The number of species peaked around the early Miocene ( million years ago) and declined afterward. Examples of ancient platanistids include the genera &quot;Otekaikea&quot; and &quot;Waipatia&quot; and the species &quot;Awamokoa tokarahi&quot; of late Oligocene New Zealand, the family Allodelphinidae of early Miocene North Pacific, and &quot;Notocetus vanbenedeni&quot; and &quot;Aondelphis talen&quot; of early Miocene Patagonia. Platanistidae fossils have been found in Miocene deposits in Europe and North America. Fossil Platanistoidea showed a diversity of cochlea shapes, though &quot;Platanista&quot; was unusual in that it developed flatter spirals with larger gaps between them. 

During the middle Miocene, the ancestor of &quot;Platanista&quot; entered the Indo-Gangetic Plain, then covered by inland seas, and remained there when sea levels dropped in the late Neogene and its environment converted to freshwater. River dolphins likely traveled from the Ganges River basin to the Indus via stream capture within the last five million years. The split between the two species is estimated to have occurred around 550,000 years ago based on mitochondrial DNA.

==Description==

South Asian river dolphins are stocky with broad, squared-off pectoral fins; elongated, slender rostrums (snouts); and tiny triangular dorsal fins. Their neck joints give them great flexibility. Unusual among cetaceans, the blowhole is slit-shaped. The finger bones can also be seen through the flippers. South Asian river dolphins possess some features that are &quot;primitive&quot; for a cetacean, such as a cecum connected to the gut and air sacs near the blowhole. The testes of the males are located closer to the underside than in marine dolphins and descend more. Their skin ranges from grey to greyish-brown in colour, though the rostrum and surrounding areas may have some pinkish colouration. The Indus species tends to be more brownish.

In one study sampling 46 Ganges river dolphins, the maximum length and weight recorded were and . For the Indus species, the maximum length and weight were and (80 individuals sampled). Female Ganges dolphins are generally longer than Indus dolphins of both sexes, while male Ganges dolphins are shorter than Indus dolphins of both sexes. Indus dolphins tend to be proportionally heavier than Ganges dolphins, independent of sex.

South Asian river dolphin skulls have unusual features. The maxilla (fixed upper jawbone) has pneumatic extensions or &quot;crests&quot; on each side which curve around the melon and protrude forward over the rostrum. These likely help them focus their echolocation signals in their riverine environment. The Ganges species also has a protrusion near the frontal suture, which distinguishes it from the Indus species. The teeth of South Asian river dolphins are curved and longer in the front, where they remain exposed when the jaws are closed. Indus dolphins have more teeth than Ganges dolphins, averaging 33.2 teeth in the upper jaw and the 32.9 in the lower jaw, as compared to 28.4 in the upper jaw and 29.4 in the lower. 

Living in murky waters, South Asian river dolphins are nearly blind, their tiny eyes having flattened corneas and no lens. The retina—which connects to a reduced optic nerve—does not form images but instead merely discerns light. The animal relies on a sphincter-like muscle around the eye to control access to the retina and prevent light scattering, similar to a pinhole. The ears are adapted to hearing low frequencies, having a short, flattened cochlea with widely spaced spirals.

==Distribution and habitat==
South Asian river dolphins inhabit the northern waterways of the Indian subcontinent. Ganges river dolphins live in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna, Karnaphuli, and Sangu rivers and their tributaries. Their range extends from the Himalayan foothills to the Ganges Delta, across the countries of Nepal, India and Bangladesh. It is unknown if they are present in Bhutan. Outflows of freshwater into the Bay of Bengal have allowed them to swim along the coast, and there is at least one record of an individual entering the Budhabalanga River, around southwest of the Ganges Delta. This species has maintained much of its range since the 19th century but has disappeared from some northern and western rivers and waterways. 

The Indus river dolphin mainly lives in the Indus River of Pakistan, with three subpopulations between the Chashma, Taunsa, Guddu, and Sukkur barrages. Two other populations exist south of Sukkur and in the Beas River of India. In the 19th century, this species was reported to have occurred throughout the Indus River system, from the Indus River Delta north to Kalabagh just south of the Himalayas, including all the main tributaries. The Indus river dolphin is reported to have disappeared between the Jinnah and Chashma barrages after 2001. 

South Asian river dolphins inhabit major river channels during the dry season and travel to smaller tributaries for the monsoon. They are most commonly found in stream pools, meanders, and confluences, and around river islands and shoals, which produce relatively stable waters. They can be found in pools over deep, but usually dwell in shallower water.

==Behaviour and life history==
South Asian river dolphins appear to be active throughout the day. Living in flowing waters, they swim almost constantly with only brief periods of sleep, which add up to seven hours per day. They swim on their sides when in shallow water. River dolphins generally surface with the rostrum, head, and dorsal fin breaking the water and rarely breach or raise the tail fluke, though surface activity can vary based on age, distance from shore and time of day. Diving may last as long as eight minutes among adults and subadults; dives of newborns and juveniles are not as long. 

River dolphins are typically seen alone or in groups of up to 10 individuals, though enough natural resources may attract up to 30 dolphins. Individuals do not appear to have strong social bonds, outside of mothers and calves. Living in shallow river environments with acoustic obstacles, these dolphins echolocate using repetitive clicks spaced 10 to 100 milliseconds apart. Their clicks are about one octave below those of oceanic toothed whales of comparable size, meaning that they provide less information about the location of an object, but the dolphins&#x27; maxillary crests likely compensate by providing greater directional sensitivity. Vocalisations used for communication include bursts and twitterings.

River dolphins feed mainly on fish and shrimp. In one meta study, around 46% of prey items were found to be bottom-dwelling species, while 31% were near the surface, and 23% occupied the middle of the column. The most frequently taken prey are bagrid catfish, barbs, glass perches, spiny eels, gobies, and prawns. When hunting at the surface, dolphins listen for the movements of schooling fish which are then herded with spins, side-swimming, and lobtailing. Echolocation signals are not frequently used at the surface, since many fish at this level can hear ultrasound. At the mid-surface level, the dolphins use more echolocation clicks to find prey hidden in clutter and vegetation as far as away. They flush out bottom-dwelling prey by digging around. 

Little is known about reproduction in these river dolphins. Courtship and mating behaviour for the Ganges species has been documented from March to May, when the water level is lower, and involves multiple males chasing one female and ends with one of the males earning the right to mate. Calves are born around a year later. Births in the Ganges river dolphin appear to be most frequent between December and January and between March and May. For Indus river dolphins, newborns are most commonly seen between April and May. Indus river dolphins calves are around long at birth and may nurse for up to a year. They eat their first solid food within a couple months. South Asian river dolphins reach sexual maturity at around ten years, though males may not reach their adult size until 20 years. Growth layers in the teeth suggest South Asian river dolphins can live up to 30 years.

==Conservation==

As of 2022, the IUCN Red List of mammals lists both South Asian river dolphins as endangered. Two assessments in 2014 and 2015 estimated populations of 3,500 for the Ganges river dolphin and 1,500 for the Indus river dolphin. The Ganges species appears to be decreasing, while the Indus species may be increasing. The habitat of these river dolphins intersects with some of the most densely populated areas, leading to intense competition for water and resources. 

The creation of dams and barrages in the Indus River system have heavily fragmented the range of the Indus river dolphin, leading to a population decline of 80% since the 19th century. Around 50 such structures have been built in the historical range of the Ganges species. Fragmentation of populations makes these dolphins more vulnerable to inbreeding. The heavy extraction of water in these dense populations also puts the dolphins at risk.

River dolphins accumulate high amounts of persistent organic pollutants, pesticides, and heavy metals in their system due to being at the top of their riverine food web. Hence, they are seen as bioindicators for the health of river systems. Fishermen compete with these animals for fish of certain sizes. Dolphins captured in fishing nets are usually accidental, but dolphin oil is sought after as a fish lure, and thus fishermen may be motivated to kill caught dolphins. Being nearly blind and relying on echolocation for navigation, river dolphins are also negatively affected by noise pollution from boats.

South Asian river dolphins are protected by law in all the states they inhabit. They can be found in numerous protected areas, including ones established specifically for them, such as the Indus Dolphin Reserve in Pakistan and the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary in India. International trade is prohibited by the listing of the South Asian river dolphins on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The Ganges and Indus river dolphins are considered to be the national aquatic animals of India and Pakistan respectively.

<doc id="267316" wikidata="Q240818" url="?curid=267316" title="Earl of Lichfield">
<text>Earl of Lichfield is a title that has been created three times, twice in the Peerage of England (1645 and 1674) and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom (1831). The third creation is extant and is held by a member of the Anson family.

==History==
===Earls of Lichfield, first creation (1645)===
The first creation, in the Peerage of England, was in December 1645 by King Charles I for his 4th cousin Charles Stewart (1639–1672), whose youngest uncle Lord Bernard Stewart (1623-26 September 1645) (youngest son of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox), had been due to be created Earl of Lichfield by Charles I for his actions at the battles of Newbury and Naseby but died aged 22 in the Battle of Rowton Heath before the creation could be implemented. Charles Stewart, the son of Bernard&#x27;s elder brother George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny (who had been killed at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642), was in his place created &quot;Earl of Lichfield&quot; in December 1645. In 1660 the 1st Earl succeeded his infant first cousin, Esmé Stuart, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 5th Duke of Lennox (1649–1660) in his titles and thus became also 3rd Duke of Richmond and 6th Duke of Lennox.

In that same year he was created Hereditary Great Chamberlain of Scotland, Hereditary Great Admiral of Scotland, and Lord-Lieutenant of Dorset. On 15 April 1661, following the Restoration of the Monarchy, he was invested by King Charles II with the Order of the Garter. He married three times, but produced no surviving male issue, being the last in the male line of Stewart of Aubigny, much beloved cousins of the Stewart monarchs. One of his wives was Frances Teresa Stuart, the celebrated beauty and alleged former mistress of King Charles II.

In disgrace with the king, Charles was sent into exile as ambassador to Denmark, where he drowned on 12 December 1672. All of the English and Scottish titles that descended in the male line became extinct. The titles of Richmond and Lennox (which had merged into the crown in 1485 and 1586 respectively) and Aubigny, were re-granted by King Charles II (with the cooperation of the French King) to his last mistress Louise de Kérouaille, 1st Duchesse d&#x27;Aubigny, and her illegitimate issue by him, namely Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox, whose descendants survive today at Goodwood House in Sussex.

===Earls of Lichfield, second creation (1674)===

The second creation, in the Peerage of England, came in 1674 when King Charles II bestowed the titles of &quot;Baron Spelsbury&quot;, &quot;Viscount Quarendon&quot; and &quot;Earl of Lichfield&quot; upon Sir Edward Lee, 5th Baronet, of Quarendon (1663–1716) in anticipation of his marriage to the king&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Charlotte Fitzroy, whose mother was Barbara Villiers. The wedding took place in 1677. The &quot;Lee baronetcy&quot;, of Quarendon in Buckinghamshire, had been created in the Baronetage of England in 1611 for Henry Lee. He was the cousin and heir of Henry Lee of Ditchley.

The 1st Earl of Lichfield from the Lee family was succeeded by his third but eldest surviving son, George Henry Lee, who became the 2nd Earl and 6th Baronet. He constructed the stately home of Ditchley in Oxfordshire. On his death the titles passed to his son George Henry Lee, the 3rd Earl. He represented Oxfordshire in the House of Commons and served as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners from 1762 to 1772. He died childless and was succeeded by his grand-uncle Robert, the 4th Earl. He was also childless. On his death in 1776 all his titles became extinct.

===Country seat===
The family seat of the Anson earls of Lichfield was Shugborough Hall, Staffordshire, about fifteen miles from the city of Lichfield. Admiral Anson, the 1st Earl of Lichfield and others are buried at St Michael and All Angels Church in Colwich, a short distance from Shugborough Hall. 
The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Earl and other Ansons of Shugborough after 1854 were buried in the churchyard of St Stephen&#x27;s Church in Great Haywood. 

Following his father&#x27;s death in 1960, Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield, decided to give Shugborough Hall up to the National Trust in lieu of death duties, an arrangement finalized in 1966. For his own burial, he chose the Anson vault at Colwich and was buried there in 2005.

===Earls of Lichfield, third creation (1831)===

The third creation, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, came in William IV&#x27;s coronation honours of 1831 in favour of Thomas Anson, 2nd Viscount Anson (1795–1854), a landowner and Whig politician from the Anson family who served as Master of the Buckhounds from 1830 to 1834 and as Postmaster General from 1835 to 1841.

The 1st Earl was the eldest son of Thomas Anson, 1st Viscount Anson, who on 17 February 1806 had been created Baron Soberton, of Soberton in the County of Southampton, and Viscount Anson, of Shugborough and Orgreave in the County of Stafford, both in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Also in 1831, the 1st Earl&#x27;s cousin William Anson was made a baronet (see Anson Baronets). The earldom of Lichfield continued to descend within the Anson family from father to son until the death of the 4th Earl, in 1960. He was succeeded by his grandson, the 5th Earl, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (1913–1958), eldest son of the 4th Earl. Known professionally as Patrick Lichfield, he was a successful photographer.

 the titles are held by the 6th Earl, only son of the 5th Earl and Lady Leonora Grosvenor, daughter of the 5th Duke of Westminster. He succeeded as the 6th Earl of Lichfield upon his father&#x27;s death on 11 November 2005. The 6th Earl married in December 2009 Lady Henrietta Conyngham, daughter of Henry Conyngham, 8th Marquess Conyngham. They have one son, Thomas Ossian Patrick Wolfe Anson, Viscount Anson (b. 20 May 2011).

The courtesy title of the eldest son and heir apparent of the Earl is &quot;Viscount Anson&quot;.

<text>Al-Qastal (&quot;Kastel&quot;, ) was a Palestinian village located eight kilometers west of Jerusalem and named for a Crusader castle located on the hilltop. Used during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as a military base by the Army of the Holy War, virtually all of its residents fled during the fighting and the village was eventually captured by the Palmach.

==History==
===Crusader period===
A Crusader castle called &quot;Belveer&quot; or &quot;Beauverium&quot; (in Latin &quot;Videbelum&quot;) was built there around 1168 CE. It is listed among the castles destroyed by Sultan al-Adil I in 1191–92 CE. No trace remains today of the castle.

Belveer is mentioned in a letter from Eraclius, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, written in the aftermath of the catastrophic Crusader defeat at the Battle of Hattin and dated September 1187, in which he describes the capture by the Muslims of a long list of towns of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the slaughter of Christians &quot;by the sword of Mafumetus the Unbeliever and his evil worshipper Saladin&quot;.

===Ottoman period===
In 1838 &quot;el-Kustul&quot; was noted as a Muslim village, part of &quot;Beni Malik&quot; area, located west of Jerusalem.

In 1863, Victor Guérin found modern buildings on ancient ruins. He noted that the village belonged to the Abu Ghosh clan.
An Ottoman village list from about 1870 found that &quot;Kastal&quot; had a population of 10, in 5 houses; the population count included only men.

In 1883, in the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot;, al-Qastal was described as &quot;a small stone village in a conspicuous position on a rocky hill-top&quot; with springs to the east.

In 1896 the population of &quot;El-kastal&quot; was estimated to be about 39 persons.

===British Mandate period===
In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Qastal had a population 43, all Muslims,
increasing in the 1931 census to 59; 55 Muslims and 4 Christians, in a total of 14 houses.

In the 1945 statistics, the village, with a population of 90 Muslims, had a total of 42 dunums of land allocated to cereals. 169 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, including 50 dunams of olive trees.

===1948 war===
In 1948, al-Qastal was a key position on the Jaffa-Jerusalem road and was used by Arab forces to attack Jewish relief convoys so as to prevent them from reaching the besieged Jewish parts of Jerusalem. For this purpose, it was occupied by the Army of the Holy War led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, the commander of the Jerusalem Hills sector.

The village was assaulted by the Palmach&#x27;s Harel Brigade and two squads of the Haganah during Operation Nachshon, after a previous minor clash had already caused most civilian inhabitants to flee. Palmach troops occupied the village on April 3, but its commander was refused permission to blow up the houses.

Forces under Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni attacked and besieged the Haganah-held village on 7 April 1948. During the following, foggy night Al-Husayni himself was killed by a Haganah sentinel. On April 8, armed Arabs from the entire area, motivated by the disappearance of their leader, attacked and recaptured al-Qastal. However, Al-Husayni&#x27;s death is said to have led to a loss of morale among his forces.
Most fighters left their positions to attend al-Husayni&#x27;s funeral at the Masjid Al-Aqsa on Friday, April 9. Palmach troops retook the almost fully deserted village on the night of April 8-9th; they blew up most of the houses and made the hill a command post, which they managed to hold on to.

===Israel===
Parts of the Israeli town of Mevaseret Zion are located on the former lands of Al-Qastal.

The remains of the village at the hilltop has been fitted out by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority as &quot;Castel National Site&quot;, &quot;a symbol of the struggle to break through to Jerusalem during the War of Independence&quot;, where one can visit the 1948 trenches and a monument to the fallen, see a movie, and descend along a scenic trail.

<text>A tram stop, tram station, streetcar stop, or light rail station is a place designated for a tram, streetcar, or light rail vehicle to stop so passengers can board or alight it. Generally, tram stops share most characteristics of bus stops, but because trams operate on rails, they often include railway platforms, especially if stepless entries are provided for accessibility. However, trams may also be used with bus stop type flags and with mid-street pavements as platforms, in street running mode.

== Types of tram stops ==
=== Tram stops without platforms ===
Many tram or streetcar stops, especially on older tram lines street-running on narrower streets, have no dedicated platforms. Instead, stops are located in the middle of the roadway. Passengers need to cross lanes for motor vehicles to board or alight from trams.

Examples of systems with this type of stops include:

North America

* Toronto, ON, Canada: Most stops on all TTC streetcar routes except 509, 510, and 512
* San Francisco, CA, United States: Muni Metro Lines J, K, L, M, and N and cable cars
* Philadelphia, PA, United States: SEPTA Routes 11, 13, 14, 15, 34, 36, 101, and 102.
* Dallas, TX, United States: M-Line Trolley
* New Orleans, LA, United States: St. Charles Streetcar (in Central Business District)
* Boston, MA, United States: MBTA Green Line E Branch (3 stops) 
Europe

* Berlin, Germany: Berlin Trams
* Frankfurt am Main, Germany: Frankfurt Trams
* Vienna, Austria: Vienna Trams
* Lisbon, Portugal: Lisbon Trams
Oceania

* Melbourne, VIC, Australia: Melbourne Trams (many stops outside CBD)
Asia

* Hiroshima, Japan: Hiroshima Electric Railway (Koami-cho station)
* Okayama, Japan: Okayama Electric Tramway (Chunagon and Kobashi stations)
* Takaoka, Japan: Manyosen Takaoka Kido Line (Kataharamachi, Yochihisa, Shin-Yoshihisa stations)
* Hong Kong SAR: Hong Kong Tramways (6 stops)
* Dalian, China: Dalian Tram Route 201
* Kolkata, India: Kolkata Tram
In most jurisdictions, to protect passengers&#x27; safety, at stops without a safety zone or designated platform, traffic cannot legally pass a tram or streetcar whose doors are open.

=== Tram stops with high-level platforms ===
Several light rail systems have high-platform stops or stations with dedicated platforms at railway platform height. Reasons for this include systems being created from former heavy rail routes (as in the case of the Metrolink system in Greater Manchester, England), or to provide a more rapid transit-like commuting experience (such as the Metro Rail system in Los Angeles, California). Such trams also stop at dedicated platform stops on Stadtbahn systems in Germany, especially in underground stations in city centres.

=== Tram stops with mixed-level platforms ===

Several tram stops have mixed platform heights for various reasons.
In The Hague, Netherlands, on tram lines 3, 4, and 34, between Laan van NOI and Leidschenveen stops, platforms feature mixed heights to accommodate both the high-floor Rotterdam Metro line E and the low-floor standard tram vehicles. 

Some stops in the pre-metro network in Brussels feature high platforms with cutouts along the edge. This allows passengers to board low-floor trams while maintaining the potential for future upgrade to full-scale metro operations. The cutouts act as access points for low-floor vehicles, ensuring the station can easily transition to a fully high-platform configuration when necessary.

The Muni Metro system in San Francisco utilizes high-floor light rail vehicles (LRVs). To ensure accessibility for wheelchair users, many street-level stations feature ramps for level boarding. Non-wheelchair users, however, access the LRV by climbing the interior steps from the street-level platform.

=== Tram stops with triangular platforms===

Triangular tram stops, where three tracks form a single triangular platform in the middle, are possible due to the shorter length of trams compared to heavy rail trains which does not require an excessively large area. Notable examples of triangular tram stops include platforms 1, 4, and 5 at Siu Hong stop on the Hong Kong Light Rail, and tracks A1, B1, and C1 at Königsplatz on the Augsburg Tram system. 

Such configuration allows cross-platform interchange across three lines as opposed to two on traditional island platforms, increasing the likelihood of convenient cross-platform transfers. 

However, triangular tram stop layout necessitates three flat junctions immediately at each end of the platform, introducing additional operational complexities and the potential for delays, particularly during periods of heavy tram traffic, as a tram heading in one direction may have to wait for trains heading in another direction to clear the junction before it can cross. In addition, to reach the platforms, trams must make sharp turns, typically by about 30 degrees, which poses issues such as slow speeds and noise.

=== Sunday tram stops ===

Not all tram stops are served full-time. In the 1920s, Toronto created Sunday stops in addition to regular stops along its streetcar routes. Sunday stops were only used on a Sunday and, with few exceptions, were always near a Christian church. There were also a few Sunday stops near subway stations that were usable only before 9 am, the Sunday opening time of the subway system. However, the Toronto Transit Commission decided to close all Sunday stops on June 7, 2015. The TTC found that Sunday stops slow down streetcars making it more difficult to maintain schedules. Also, Sunday stops were also unfair to non-Christian places of worship which never had the equivalent of a Sunday stop. By 2015, most Sunday stops were along current and former streetcar routes.
=== Tram stops with platform screen doors ===
The Dubai Tram, which opened on 12 November 2014, became the world&#x27;s first tram system to feature platform screen doors at its tram stops. Lussail LRT and Tel Aviv Light Rail both have platform screen doors at underground stops.

<doc id="267323" wikidata="Q775299" url="?curid=267323" title="Chippenham">
<text>Chippenham is a market town in north-west Wiltshire, England. It lies north-east of Bath, west of London and is near the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The town was established on a crossing of the River Avon, where some form of settlement is believed to have existed since before Roman times. It was a royal vill and probably a royal hunting lodge, under Alfred the Great. The town continued to grow when the Great Western Railway arrived in 1841. It had a population of 36,548 in 2021.

==History==
===Etymology===
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records the town as &quot;Cippanhamme&quot;: this could refer to a person called Cippa who had his hamm, an enclosure in a river meadow. An alternative theory suggests that the name is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;ceap&quot;, meaning &#x27;market&#x27;. The name is recorded variously as Cippanhamm (878), Cepen (1042), Cheppeham (1155), Chippenham (1227), Shippenham (1319) and Chippyngham (1541). In John Speed&#x27;s map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt both &quot;Chippenham&quot; (for the hundred) and &quot;Chipnam&quot; (for the town).

===Earliest settlement===
There are believed to have been settlements in the Chippenham region since before Roman times. Remains of Romano-British settlements are visible in the wall behind the former magistrates&#x27; court, and recent redevelopments of the town have shown up other evidence of early settlements.

===Early Medieval===
The town (not counting the Roman villages now within its boundaries) is believed to have been founded by Anglo-Saxons around AD 600. In AD 853, Æthelswith (sister to Alfred the Great) married King Burgred of Mercia at Chippenham. Alfred was then a boy of four and the wedding was held on the site of St Andrew&#x27;s church. According to Bishop Asser&#x27;s &quot;Life of King Alfred&quot;, Chippenham was, under Alfred&#x27;s reign, a royal vill; historians have also argued, from its proximity to the royal forests at Melksham and Barden, that it was probably a hunting lodge. Alfred&#x27;s daughter was also married in Chippenham.

Danish Vikings successfully besieged Chippenham in 878. Later that year, at the Battle of Ethandun, Alfred decisively defeated the Danes, whose forces then surrendered to Alfred at Chippenham (ushering in the establishment of the Danelaw).

In 1042, the royal holding in Chippenham makes mention of a church. The 1086 Domesday Book listed Chippenham as &quot;Chepeham&quot;, with a substantial population of 177 households.

===High and Late Medieval===
In Norman times, the royal properties were separated into the manors of Sheldon, Rowden and Lowden. Records show that the town expanded into Langstret (now the Causeway) from 1245, and from 1406 into Le Newstret (now the New Road area of town). Throughout this period, Chippenham continued to have a thriving market in the town centre.

The A4 that runs through Chippenham incorporates parts of the 14th-century medieval road network that linked London to Bristol. This was an important road for the English cloth trade, and so its upkeep was funded in part by Bristol cloth merchants.

Chippenham was represented in the Parliament of England from 1295, and Queen Mary granted the town a Charter of Incorporation in 1554.

Analysis of the wood used to build the Yelde Hall indicates that the market hall was built around 1450. The Shambles and Buttercross were built after 1570. The Shambles were destroyed in a fire in 1856 but the Yelde Hall survived.

The parish of Chippenham Without encompasses the deserted medieval village of Sheldon, devastated by plague; all that remains today is Sheldon Manor, Wiltshire&#x27;s oldest inhabited manor house, dating from 1282.

===16th to 18th centuries===
The wool industry took off in the 16th century, partly due to the river. The plague hit the town hard in 1611 and 1636. This, a recession in the woollen industry, and a drop in corn production in 1622 and 1623, caused massive hardship for the town&#x27;s population. The trade in cloth faced further problems during the English Civil War due to a Royalist proclamation that prohibited the sale of cloth to the Parliamentarian-controlled London.

In 1747, a bribery and corruption scandal (involving two members of parliament for Chippenham) led to the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole&#x27;s government.
===19th and 20th centuries===
A branch to Chippenham off the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal was built in 1798, terminating at a wharf at Timber Street near the marketplace; the main commodity traded was coal. The site of the wharf is now the town&#x27;s bus station, and part of Pewsham Way follows the line of the branch. The Great Western Railway arrived in Chippenham in 1841, and in turn attracted many new businesses. The arrival of these businesses required new housing which led to the expansion of the town into land north of the railway, which in turn led to the growth of further industries to support the building work.

The arrival of the railway promoted the growth of industrial agricultural businesses. In the middle of the 19th century, Chippenham was a major centre for the production of dairy and ham products; this led, later, to Nestlé and Matteson&#x27;s having factories in the town centre. The railway also led to the growth of railway engineering works in Chippenham: the first of these was Roland Brotherhood in 1842. A variety of companies then took over part or all of the business on the site, until in 1935 Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd took over the site fully. The signalling side of the business remains at the Chippenham site and is now owned by Siemens Rail Automation Group; the brakes business was taken over by the German company Knorr-Bremse, and is in nearby Melksham.

On 17 April 1960, American singers Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, and songwriter Sharon Sheeley, were involved in a car crash in Chippenham at Rowden Hill. Cochran died as a result of his injuries and a memorial plaque was erected near the site.

On 13 February 1998, two unexploded bombs from World War II were discovered in the field behind Hardens Mead during preparations for the building of Abbeyfield School. About 1,100 residents in the east of Chippenham had to be evacuated for two nights until the army carried out a controlled explosion. The Army initially tried to defuse the larger device, but it was decided that owing to the bomb&#x27;s orientation in the ground this would be too dangerous.

==Geography==

===Location===
Chippenham is in western Wiltshire, at a prominent crossing of the River Avon. It is located between the Marlborough Downs to the east, the southern Cotswolds to the north and west, and Salisbury Plain to the south-east.

The town is surrounded by sparsely populated countryside and there are several woodlands in or very near the town, such as Bird&#x27;s Marsh, Vincients Wood and Briars Wood.

===Suburbs===
Suburbs include Cepen Park (North &amp; South), Hardenhuish, Monkton, Lowden, Pewsham, Primrose Hill, Englands, Frogwell, Derriads, The Folly, Redland, Queens Crescent, Lackham, Fenway Park and Hill Rise; these loosely correspond to local government wards.

===Landmarks===
The original Buttercross, a stone structure, was erected in c. 1570 and stood at the centre of the Shambles at the current location of Barclays Bank. It was used for the sale of meat and dairy products. In 1889, Mr E.C. Lowndes bought the structure for £6 and re-erected it as a gazebo in the kitchen garden of the manor house at Castle Combe, where it fell into disrepair. The Buttercross was re-erected in 1995 by the Chippenham Civic Society, funded by many local people and organisations. It currently stands as the centre-piece of the pedestrianised area of the town centre, where a market is held each Friday and Saturday.

The Yelde Hall is one of very few remaining medieval timber framed buildings in the town. It originally was divided internally for use as a market hall. Both the hall and its meeting room upstairs were used by the burgess and bailiff for a variety of meetings and trials as well as for Council meetings. The space under the Council Chamber was used as the town gaol.
===Climate===
==Population==

The population of Chippenham civil parish recorded at the 2021 census was 36,548.

Chippenham&#x27;s population grew rapidly in the 1990s, from 25,376 in 1991 to 28,065 at the 2001 census, an increase of 11%. This reflected the development of large housing estates (indeed, entirely new suburbs) such as Cepen Park to the west of the town, and the Pewsham development to the east (named for the small village of Pewsham, further east). 
==Governance==
The offices of North Wiltshire District Council were in the town until 2009, when a unitary authority was created for the whole of Wiltshire. The offices in Monkton Park were taken over by Wiltshire Council, which has its headquarters in Trowbridge.

The office of Town Mayor was established in 1835, before which Chippenham was governed by a bailiff supported by burgesses. Elected annually by the Town Council, the Mayor is generally appointed to office in May each year, at the &quot;Mayor Making&quot; ceremony. As part of their duties as the first citizen of a town, the Mayor visits organisations, charities and groups representing all parts of the local community, acting as a figurehead to promote goodwill, cultural exchange, trade and commerce. The Mayor also nominates a charity which they will support throughout their year of office. Other tasks include presiding over Town Council meetings and acting as president of various local organisations, such as the Twinning Association and the Sea Cadets.

In 1812, Sir Robert Peel, the creator of the modern police force, served as one of the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Chippenham.

Until 2010, the town was within the parliamentary constituency of North Wiltshire, traditionally a Conservative stronghold, although in the 19th century some Liberal members were elected. Boundary changes for the 2010 general election saw Liberal Democrat candidate Duncan Hames become the Member of Parliament for Chippenham, a newly created constituency formed from parts of three neighbouring constituencies. In 2015, Chippenham was won for the Conservatives by Michelle Donelan, who held it until 2024 when Sarah Gibson of the Liberal Democrats won the seat, after further significant boundary changes.

Chippenham Town Council, which is based at Chippenham Town Hall, is responsible for some public services in the town. For 2020–21 they set the 13th highest council tax of any lowest tier (parish/town) council in England at £262.05 per Band D property, and proposed to increase this to £270.44 for 2021–22. Unlike most town and parish councils, the Town Council employs a Chief Executive rather than a Town Clerk.

==Economy==

Historically a market town, Chippenham&#x27;s economy has since changed to that of a commuter town with residents travelling to workplaces in Bath, Bristol, Swindon and even London (almost 100 miles to the east).

Several large businesses have been located in the region, with the biggest former employer being Westinghouse, now owned by Siemens, whose factory complex lies next to the railway station. The company undertakes railway signalling contracts for Network Rail, London Underground as well as railway operators in other parts of the world, e.g. Beijing Subway, Oslo Public Transport Administration, SMRT Corporation, Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, MTR Corporation and many others. Parts of the Westinghouse site are occupied by a range of companies. There are a number of other industrial sites around the town, Bumpers Farm being the largest.

In 2005, Wincanton PLC, Europe&#x27;s second-largest logistics organisation, consolidated its head office operations and moved to the newly developed Methuen Park office development in west Chippenham, where it employs around 350 people.

===Market===
Chippenham is a market town, with street markets taking place every Friday and Saturday around Market Place and along the High Street. A Farmers&#x27; Market for the sale of fresh, locally produced foodstuffs is also held here once a fortnight. The original Cattle Market, which closed in 2004, is now being redeveloped by Linden Homes Western Limited as one of the UK&#x27;s largest eco-housing projects.

===Shopping===
Chippenham&#x27;s main retail area surrounds the High Street (which is closed to traffic during the day) and the Market Place. Two shopping centres lie on either side of the High Street: the enclosed Emery Gate Shopping Centre and the open-air Borough Parade. In and around the High Street, there are very few independent shops as franchises dominate; there are some independent shops along The Causeway and in the Upper Market Place.

Retail parks, such as the Hathaway Retail Park, Bath Road Retail Park and the Chippenham Retail Park (Bumpers Way), are towards the edge of town and contain larger superstores and fast-food outlets.

The Chippenham Co-operative Society was founded in 1890. Over the years, it played an increasing role in the local economy, becoming deeply involved in agriculture and dairy farming, and for most of the 20th century its department store dominated the lower end of the High Street. However, by the 1960s, the business was facing increasing competition and found it necessary to join forces with other co-operatives, first locally, then nationally, forming The Co-operative Group. In the 1980s, this flagship store was sold and became a Wilko branch, but the Co-operative Group diversified into other areas, such as insurance and funeral services, which still operate through many local branches.

==Transport==

===Railway===

Chippenham railway station is a stop on the Great Western Main Line. Great Western Railway operates inter-city trains to London Paddington, , , , , , and . It is also served by a route connecting Swindon with , via . The Chippenham and Calne line formerly connected the town to Calne but is now a cycle path. 

The station is famous for its railway arches and other buildings engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as part of the historic Great Western Railway development.

===Roads===
Chippenham lies south of the M4 motorway, which links the town to Bristol, Swindon, South Wales and London. The A4 former coach road, A420 and B4069 provide further road links to Bath, Bristol and Oxford.

The town is bypassed to the west by the A350, which links the M4 motorway with Chippenham and nearby towns to the south, such as Melksham, Westbury, Frome, Warminster and Trowbridge before entering Dorset where it terminates in Poole. The A4 national route crosses the southern part of the town, linking Chippenham to nearby Corsham, Calne and Bath. In November 2019, the government approved an eastern extension linking the A4 to the A350 north of Cepen Park. A link road bypassing the new Birds Marsh area to the north-east of the town opened in 2022.

===Buses===
Chippenham&#x27;s bus services are operated by Stagecoach West, Faresaver and Coachstyle. Key routes include the 55 to Swindon, X31 to Bath, X34 to Trowbridge and Frome, 33 to Devizes, 44K to Kington St Michael and 99 to Malmesbury and Swindon. National Express coach services call at Chippenham to destinations including Bath, Bristol, Swansea, Heathrow Airport and London.

==Tourism==
Surrounding the town are a number of stone-built villages, including Lacock (National Trust), Biddestone, Bremhill, and Castle Combe. The great house and art treasures of &quot;Longleat&quot;, &quot;Bowood House&quot;, &quot;Lacock Abbey&quot;, &quot;Sheldon Manor&quot; and &quot;Corsham Court&quot; are within easy reach. Chippenham Museum and Heritage Centre is in the town centre and tells the story of the market town.

===Twinned towns===
Chippenham is twinned with La Flèche in France and Friedberg in Germany.

La Flèche is on the Loire, from Le Mans and from Tours. Its Prytanée national militaire school dates back to the time of King Henry IV of France.

Friedberg is a walled town from Munich and the Bavarian Alps, founded in 1264 by Ludwig the severe and his nephew. It holds many sporting and cultural events such as the 17th century Street Festival.

==Culture==

The Chippenham Folk Festival takes place every year, usually over the Whitsuntide weekend.

There is an annual festival in remembrance of American rock and roll singer Eddie Cochran, who died on 17 April 1960 following a car accident in Chippenham on his way back to London during a tour.

From 1963, the Town Museum was housed in the Yelde Hall. By 2000, it had outgrown the site and moved to the former Magistrates&#x27; Court in the Market Place. The museum charts the history of the town from Neolithic times until today. By 2005, the museum had attracted over 90,000 visitors.

== Local media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Chippenham is served by these local radio stations: BBC Radio Wiltshire, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and Chippenham Hospital Radio which broadcast from the Chippenham Community Hospital in the town. 

The local newspapers are the Gazette and Herald and Wiltshire Times.

==Sport and leisure==

Chippenham is well served with sports clubs and leisure facilities. The Olympiad Leisure Centre opened in 1989, replacing an outdoor pool which had closed in 1988. It caters for a wide range of interests and has a variety of swimming pools and full gym facilities. It also hosts events including the popular annual CAMRA Beer Festival.

Chippenham Sports Club, on the A420 Bristol Road, is a members&#x27; sports club. Its facilities include a two-storey pavilion that overlooks the six hard-surface floodlit tennis courts and the cricket square and field. The all-weather hockey pitches are used by ladies&#x27; and men&#x27;s teams. The Dome, an inflatable, all year round, indoor sports dome, provides amenities including netball, cricket nets and a five-a-side football league. Chippenham Town Bowls Club, with its own pavilion, is on the same site.

The town is home to Chippenham Town F.C. They were formed in 1873, and most notably played in the FA Vase 2000 final, when they lost 1–0 to Deal Town F.C. They currently play in the National League South. Chippenham United F.C., formed in 1905, played for twelve seasons in the Wiltshire Football League after World War II, but folded in 1962.

Chippenham Rugby Club is on the western outskirts alongside the A350 bypass and is accessed from the Bristol Road at Allington Farm Shop. This members&#x27; club has an all-weather rugby pitch and two full size grass rugby pitches, all with floodlights. In addition there are grass areas for mini rugby, all-weather cricket nets and a cricket ground used by Allington Cricket Club who have two teams.

Chippenham Golf Club, formed in 1896, is on the A350 as it leads north from the town towards the M4.

Chippenham has a small cinema, the Reel Astoria, on the A420 Marshfield Road, to the west of the town centre.

The Sustrans National Cycle Network Route 403 passes through the town.

==Education==

===17th and 18th centuries===
In his will of 1661, Richard Scott directed that his house in Cooke&#x27;s Street should be used as a school, and William Woodruffe gave an annuity of £5 in 1664 for the teaching of ten poor boys. In 1713 the school was reopened with a benefaction of £10 per annum for 24 boys.

===Late 19th century===
From 1875 a private venture grammar school existed in Chippenham, conducted in St Mary Street by Mr Wilson and from 1883 by Mr Cruikshank.

In 1891, the Technical Instruction Act 1889 (52 &amp; 53 Vict. c. 76) and the Technical Instruction Act 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. 4) provided financial assistance for evening classes in various science and arts subjects. Earlier voluntary classes were now coordinated, and this became the beginning of a national system of technical education. Subjects included Shorthand, Animal Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, Hygiene, Carpentry and Dressmaking.

In 1893, Edward Newall Tuck was appointed by the Education Committee of the Borough of Chippenham to organise technical classes in Chippenham and district. Classes were held in rented premises at No. 21 London Road and at the Jubilee Institute, as well as in villages including Grittleton and Yatton Keynell. Teachers from elementary schools attended classes in a School of Art on Saturdays at the Jubilee Institute. Mr Tuck, in addition, gave talks on Wiltshire history and nature study; he also served as town councillor and was Mayor of Chippenham from 1931 to 1932. In 1894, pupils were not admitted to classes until they reached the age of 11. Pupils from day schools were admitted free from age 11 to 16. The fees at this time were fixed at 6d per month, the whole expenses of the school being met by fees and grants from the Science and Art Department and the County Council. Higher grade classes for boys, including Woodwork and Chemistry, were held at No. 21 London Road.

In 1896, under the provisions of the Technical and Industrial Institutions Act 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. 29), the Borough of Chippenham established the Chippenham and District County School, subsequently known as the Chippenham County Secondary School for Boys and Girls, with Mr Tuck as the first headmaster (he remained in this post until 1939). The first Chair of Governors was former mayor Alderman John Coles.

The premises were still located at No. 21 London Road and the Jubilee Institute. As the tenancy of the private venture school was to end on 25 March 1896, the Town Council paid Mr Cruikshank £10 for the desks, books and goodwill of his school. Boys were drawn from three elementary schools in Chippenham: the British, National and St. Paul&#x27;s Schools. In addition twelve boys had previously attended the private grammar school. Others were from other private schools in Chippenham, Corsham, Devizes, Calne and surrounding villages. There were 39 boys aged 11 to 16 on the admission register from 13 April 1896. The curriculum included Latin, French, science, history, geography, grammar, bookkeeping, shorthand, arithmetic, writing, geometry and freehand drawing.

In September 1898, a girls&#x27; school was established, against some opposition, in the Temperance Hall, Foghamshire; 22 girls were admitted at opening, from the schools of Mrs Parry (Market Place), Miss Alexander (Monkton Hill), Mrs White (Marshfield Road), from private tuition and from local National and British schools.

===20th century===
On 24 September 1900, the Chippenham District County School opened in Cocklebury Lane, now part of Wiltshire College (built on an acre of land purchased in 1896 by the county, Urban and Rural District Councils). The ceremony was attended by the Mayor and Aldermen of Chippenham. In addition to Mr Edward Newall Tuck as headmaster, the staff included three masters and one mistress; there were 99 pupils. The total cost of the project was £6,000. In addition to the buildings and playground, four acres of adjoining land were rented for playing fields. All day classes were consolidated here and pupil numbers increased rapidly.

On 1 May 1901 the Governors decided that the school should become a Science School. Four scholarships were granted (to three girls and one boy). In July it was decided to establish a centre for pupil-teachers at the school. In 1902, local education authorities were established and Wiltshire County Council became responsible for education in Chippenham. Latin was omitted from the curriculum. By 1904 there were 101 pupils: 50 from urban and 51 from rural areas. In addition 49 pupil teachers were attending, 9 from urban and the remainder from rural schools, and the evening classes had 139 pupils. From 1905 girls from elementary schools attended Cookery classes at the Cocklebury Road site.

By October 1907 the school had 128 pupils: 64 boys and 64 girls. The age of admission was 9, and the leaving age 17 to 18. In addition to the yearly fees paid by pupils, the school was financed by County and Government grants. In 1908 the fees were five guineas a year, including books. However, there were a number of scholarships available and figures for the year show that of 115 pupils (66 girls and 49 boys), 57 held scholarships, one a &quot;free place&quot;, and only 57 were fee-payers.

In 1922, the school received further County and Government grants. In the inter-war years, numbers of pupils on roll increased steadily, and by 1929 there were 262. The Junior department was reorganised as a Kindergarten and Preparatory Form, catering for 61 children aged 8 to 10. However, the number of pupils over the age of 16 was proportionally small in comparison with the average for Wiltshire Grammar Schools, and so there was no separate &quot;sixth form&quot;, although a few pupils did go on to university, some with the aid of County Scholarships.

By the early 1930s the buildings were overcrowded, and by 1935 pupil numbers had reached 288. Wiltshire County Council purchased Hardenhuish Park from the Clutterbuck family to satisfy the educational requirements of the growing town. In 1938, the Secondary Grammar School moved from Cocklebury Road to new buildings (since demolished) on the east side of Hardenhuish House. The old Manor House became the headmaster&#x27;s room, the school library and some classrooms. The new school extended over 40 acres (16 hectares) of Hardenhuish Park; new buildings contained a hall, gymnasium, laboratories, classrooms, and cloakrooms. In 1939, the Preparatory department closed.

By 1940 there were 414 pupils, of whom 25 were evacuees. 10% were under the age of 11 and, still, only 2% over 16. The Cocklebury Road premises became Chippenham County Secondary Modern School, a senior mixed school taking children aged 11 and over from the primary schools of Chippenham and district.

===Present day===
The nearest third-level institution is the University of Bath campus at Claverton Down, 12 miles to the west of Chippenham.

Wiltshire College &amp; University Centre, the successor to Chippenham Technical College, has a campus (built in 2015) on Cocklebury Road.

Three secondary schools cater for students from age 11 through sixth form:
* Hardenhuish School and Sheldon School are on adjacent sites in the north-west of Chippenham.
* Abbeyfield School is on the south-east edge of the town.
Silverwood School, Wiltshire Council&#x27;s special school for ages 4–19, has a campus (formerly St Nicholas School) on Malmesbury Road, Chippenham.
==Religion==
In the 2001 census, 73.2% of the population in Chippenham parish defined themselves as Christian, 17.3% said they were of no religion and 8% did not state a religion.

In the 2011 census, 59.6% of the population in the parish defined themselves as Christian, 31.1% said they were of no religion and 7.3% did not state a religion.
===Church of England===
* &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s&quot; parish church is believed to have been built on the site of an Anglo-Saxon church. Many features of the present church are Norman (with the chancel arch being completed in c.1120). The spire was completed in 1633 although the 8 bells currently present were not added until 1734, and the back-lit clock and chimes in 1858. The organ has a case front dating from the 18th century. The church registers date from 1578. There was a Victorian era restoration of the interior of the church in 1875–1878 and again in the 1990s.

* &quot;St. Nicholas&quot; church was built in 1779 and replaced an older medieval church that had previously stood on the same Hardenhuish site. The church was designed by John Wood, the Younger of Bath. The church registers date from 1730.
* &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s&quot; church was built in 1854–55 by Sir George Gilbert Scott, was consecrated on 18 April 1855 and has registers dating from that time.
* &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s&quot; original build started in 1885 and opened on 19 November 1886 as a stone and red brick building. The church was replaced by the current church in 1968. The newer St Peter&#x27;s is a modern six-sided design, originally with a copper roof (now tiled), a fibreglass spire and no internal supports.

===Roman Catholic===
* &quot;Saint Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church&quot;, originally built in Saint Mary&#x27;s Place in 1855. The new church was built in 1935 on Station Hill, replacing the original on 29 February 1936.

===Non-Conformist===
* &quot;Central Methodist&quot; church was built in 1909 to mark the centenary of Methodism in Chippenham. It was originally called Monkton Hill Methodist Church but was renamed after it joined parishes with that of Primitive Methodist Chapel, The Causeway which closed in the late 1980s.
* &quot;Christian Fellowship – Elim Pentecostal Church&quot;
* &quot;Emmanuel Evangelical Church&quot; was founded in April 2005, and meets at its building on Goldney Avenue on Sundays. It is affiliated to the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches.
* &quot;Ladyfield Evangelical Church&quot; is also affiliated to the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches.
* &quot;Oasis Church&quot; was founded April 2004 by Pastors Ralph and Heather Burden of the Assemblies of God. It focuses on younger worshippers, meeting on Saturday evenings and featuring rock music.
* The &quot;Old Baptist Chapel&quot; opened on 10 June 1804 but was not registered until 1810. The internal baptistry was added in 1818.
* The &quot;Salvation Army Citadel&quot; was originally opened in 1903 in Bath Road but the building was later sold to Pictons, after which the Salvation Army moved into the Co-op hall in Foghamshire. November 2012 saw the building reopen as The Citadel Hall.
* &quot;Sheldon Road Methodist Church&quot; was built in 1901.
* &quot;Station Hill Baptist Chapel&quot; was built in 1855.
* &quot;Tabernacle United Reformed Church&quot; was built in 1770, replaced in 1826, and refitted in 1889. The church had substantial internal renovations in the 1990s.

===Closed churches===
*&quot;Cepen Park Methodist Church&quot; held services in two local schools and closed in 2005.
*&quot;Primitive Methodist Chapel, The Causeway&quot; opened in 1896, replacing an older chapel believed to have been built around 1835 on the same site, which was retained as a schoolroom at the rear of the newer building. The chapel closed in the late 1980s although the buildings remain.
*&quot;Christian Science Society Church, Lowden Avenue.&quot; The building is now used by a children&#x27;s nursery.

<doc id="267328" wikidata="Q742079" url="?curid=267328" title="Michael Albert">
<text>Michael Albert (born April 8, 1947) is an American economist, speaker, writer, and political critic. Since the late 1970s, he has published on a variety of subjects. He has set up his own media outfits, magazines, and podcasts. He is known for helping to develop the socioeconomic theory of participatory economics.

==Biography==
Albert was born in New York City and grew up in New Rochelle, New York. In 1965, Albert was studying physics at MIT. He objected to the US military&#x27;s funding of the university. This, along with the civil rights movement, led Albert to become politically active. He became a member of Students for a Democratic Society and opposed the Vietnam War. He was expelled from MIT, in January 1970, for disruptive behaviour, although he claimed the charges were &#x27;cooked-up&#x27;.

Albert founded South End Press in 1977 along with Lydia Sargent and Juliet Schor, among others.

In 1987, Albert founded &quot;Zeta Magazine&quot; with Sargent. The magazine focused on libertarian and anarchist socialist thought. It was renamed &quot;Z Magazine&quot; in 1989.

In 1990–91, Albert and Robin Hahnel worked on outlining their ideas around participatory economics. They published &quot;Looking Forward&quot; and &quot;The Political Economy of Participatory Economics&quot;, with the latter including an economic model of the system. Doug Brown, writing in the Journal of Economic Issues said their alternative to markets was novel, but mainly of academic interest.

By 1995, the organisation &quot;Z Magazine&quot; had branched out providing online content and media training. Along with the magazine the ventures are collectively known as &quot;Z Communications&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Parecon: Life After Capitalism&quot; was published further outlining participatory economics in a more accessible, less academic format. The book was translated into 20 languages. Reviewing the book Paul Ormerod felt Albert&#x27;s criticisms of capitalism were unfounded. Albert spoke at the World Social Forum in the same year. He spoke at European Social Forum in 2004.

Albert was a founding member of the International Organization for a Participatory Society, in 2012.

Sean Michael Wilson created a comic book based on Albert and his ideas in 2013.

==Beliefs==
Albert identifies himself as a market abolitionist and believes markets should be replaced with participatory economics.

==Criticism==
In 2006, David Schweickart wrote a detailed critique of participatory economics called &quot;Nonsense on Stilts: Michael Albert&#x27;s Parecon&quot;. He claimed three fundamental features of the economic system are flawed.

<text>Below is a list of villages depopulated or destroyed during the Arab–Israeli conflict.

===Arab villages===
A number of these villages, those in the Jezreel Valley, were inhabited by tenants of land which was sold by a variety of owners, some local and others absentee landlord families, such as the Karkabi, Tueini, Farah and Khuri families and Sursock family of Lebanon. In some cases land was sold directly by local &quot;fellahim&quot; (peasant owners). The sale of land to Jewish organizations meant that tenant farmers were displaced.

==1948 Arab–Israeli War==

===Arab villages===

Palestinian Arab residents were expelled from hundreds of towns and villages by the Israel Defense Forces, or fled in fear as the Israeli army advanced. Around 400 Arab towns and villages were depopulated.

===Jewish villages===
The main Jewish areas depopulated in 1948 were the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem and the Gush Etzion. Approximately 30-40km2 of land was owned by Jews in the areas which became the West Bank and Gaza Strip (approximately 6,000km2); some of this land was uninhabited.

;In areas that became the West Bank
* North Jerusalem bloc (Atarot and Neve Yaakov)
* Dead Sea block (Kalia and Beit HaArava)
* Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)
* Gush Etzion bloc near Jerusalem (Ein Tzurim, Kfar Etzion, Masuot Yitzhak, Revadim)

;In areas that became Gaza Strip (All-Palestine protectorate):
* Kfar Darom (&quot;resettled but evacuated as part of the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005&quot;)

;Israel-Syria border
* Hauran 

;In Transjordan
* Tel Or

Many of these areas were repopulated after the Six-Day War.

==Six-Day War==

===West Bank===
Three Arab villages, Bayt Nuba, Imwas and Yalo, located in the Latrun Corridor were destroyed on the orders of Yitzhak Rabin due to the corridor&#x27;s strategic location and route to Jerusalem and because of the residents&#x27; alleged aiding of Egyptian commandos in their attack on the city of Lod. The residents of the three villages were offered compensation but were not allowed to return.

Hebron/Bethlehem area
* Surit
* Beit Awwa
* Beit Mirsem
* Shuyoukh

Jordan Valley

* Agarith
* Huseirat

===Golan Heights===

Over 100,000 Golan Heights residents were evacuated from about 25 villages whether on orders of the Syrian government or through fear of an attack by the Israeli Defense Forces and expulsion after the ceasefire. During the following months, more than a hundred Syrian villages were destroyed by Israel.

==1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty==

===Israeli settlements===
Israeli settlements in the Sinai Peninsula were evacuated as a result of the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty.
* Avshalom
* Dikla
* Netiv HaAsara, Sinai
* Ofira
* Pri&#x27;el
* Sufa
* Talmei Yosef
* Yamit

==Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan==
As a part of Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan, 21 civilian Israeli settlements were forcibly evacuated, as well as an area in the northern West Bank containing four Israeli villages. The residential buildings were razed by Israel but public structures were left intact. The religious structures not removed by Israel were later destroyed by Palestinians.

===Israeli settlements===
==Since 2005==
On 5 November 2020, Israeli bulldozers demolished most of the village of Khirbet Humsa al-Fawqa and forced 73 of its Palestinian residents, including 41 children to leave in what was the largest demolition in years. On 4 February 2021, Israel razed for the second time because of what it claimed was an illegal settlement next to a military firing range. On 7 July 2021, it was demolished by Israel again for at least the third time.

In May 2023, the Israeli army destroyed the village of Ein Samiya, forcibly expelling 170 people.

<text>Levante Unión Deportiva, S.A.D. () is a Spanish football club in Valencia, in the namesake autonomous community.

Founded on 6 September 1909, Levante play in the Segunda División, holding home games at Ciutat de València Stadium.

==History==

=== Early years (1909–1935) ===

Levante UD was formerly registered as Levante Football Club on 9 September 1909 (celebrating its 100th anniversary on 9 September 2009). Thus Levante is the most senior football club in Valencia, with rival team Valencia CF not being formed until 1919.

Levante shares its name with the eastern region of the Iberian Peninsula, with Spain&#x27;s east coast, the coast over which the sun rises (&quot;levantar&quot; in Spanish), with the Levant wind that comes from the east, and with the Levante beach in La Malvarrosa where Levante Football Club played some of its earliest fixtures.

Levante&#x27;s earliest games were played at La Platjeta, near the docks on a plot of land owned by a perfume entrepreneur. Its next ground was also near the port area, and the club gradually became associated with the working class. In 1919, the side played Valencia CF for the first time, losing 0–1; the game marked the inauguration of the recently built ground at Algirós. In 1928, Levante FC won its first trophy, the Valencian Championship.

1909 also saw the birth of Gimnástico Football Club, which originally played at Patronato de la Juventud Obrera, being then named Gimnástico-Patronato. In 1919, Gimnástico became the champion of the Campeonato de Valencia, beating CD Castellón in two leg finals; the next year, the club had become &quot;Real Gimnástico Football Club&quot;, after being granted royal patronage by Alfonso XIII, and they reached the final of Campeonato Regional de Levante, but lost to Club Deportivo Aguileño. In 1931, with the founding of the Second Spanish Republic, the club dropped the &quot;Real&quot; from its name.

In 1934–35, both Levante and Gimnástico debuted in the second division, when the league was expanded from 10 teams to 24. In 1935, Levante won the Campeonato Levante-Sur, a competition that featured teams from Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia, and subsequently reached the semi-finals of the Spanish Cup, consecutively beating Valencia and Barcelona before losing to eventual runners-up Sabadell.

===During the civil war: Copa de la España Libre (1937)===
During the Spanish Civil War, Levante and Gimnástico played in the Mediterranean League, finishing fifth and sixth respectively. Teams from this league also competed in the Copa de la España Libre (&quot;Free Spain Cup&quot;). It was originally intended that the top four teams from the league would enter the cup, but Barcelona opted to tour Mexico and the United States, and as a result, Levante took its place. The first round of the competition was a mini-league with the top two teams, Levante and Valencia, qualifying for the final. On 18 July 1937, Levante defeated its city rivals 1–0 at the Montjuïc.

=== Merging: Gimnástico and Levante (1939) ===

During the Civil War, Levante&#x27;s ground was destroyed, but the club&#x27;s squad remained intact. In contrast, Gimnástico had a ground, Estadio de Vallejo, but had lost most of their players. As a result, in 1939 Levante FC and Gimnástico FC merged into Levante Unión Deportiva. Levante UD can thus trace its origin back to at least 1909 through both Levante FC and Gimnástico FC. The merged club was at first named Unión Deportiva Levante-Gimnástico, then changed it a few years later to Levante Unión Deportiva. The current club colours date from this era: the &quot;blaugrana&quot;, blue-garnet, home colours were originally those of Gimnástico FC, while the black and white away kit were the colours of Levante FC. Levante UD also inherited from Gimnástico FC their nickname, , the Frogs.

=== La Liga: relegations and promotions (1963–present) ===
Levante had to wait until the 1960s to make its La Liga debut. In 1963, the club finished runner-up in Group II of the second division, defeating Deportivo de La Coruña 4–2 on aggregate in the promotion play-offs. During the first top flight season, it managed to win both games against Valencia, and also achieved a 5–1 home win against Barcelona in the 1964–65 campaign, but was relegated nonetheless after losing in the playoffs against Málaga. It spent most of the following two decades in the second and third divisions; the Segunda División B would not be created until 1977.
In the early 1980s, Dutch superstar Johan Cruyff played half a season for the club, retiring three years later. After winning 2003–04&#x27;s second division, Levante returned to the top level but survived only one season. Finishing third in 2005–06, it returned for two additional campaigns, the decisive match in the 2006–07 season being a 4–2 home win against Valencia courtesy of Riga Mustapha (two goals), Salva and Laurent Courtois.

Levante&#x27;s financial status worsened, however, and there were reports that the players had only received approximately one-fifth of their contractual payments. News reports stated that the club had incurred a debt of over €18 million in payments due to its players. The team plummeted down the standings, and it was confirmed with several matches to go that the club would be playing in the second division in 2008–09. The players protested at their lack of payments at one point, refusing to move for several seconds after the opening whistle against Deportivo and later announcing that they would strike during the season-ending game at Real Madrid. The threat was withdrawn when league officials announced that a benefit game would be played between a Levante XI and a Primera División XI, with all receipts going to pay the Levante players&#x27; wages.

On 13 June 2010, Levante returned to La Liga after a 3–1 home win against already relegated Castellón, making its final round 0–4 defeat at Real Betis irrelevant. Under the manager who led the team back to the top flight, Luis García Plaza, Levante finally retained its top division status in the 2010–11 season. At one point in the league&#x27;s second round of matches, Levante was third in the table behind Barcelona and Real Madrid, after losing just once (against Real Madrid) in 12 games.

On 26 October 2011, during round nine of the season, Levante defeated Real Sociedad 3–2 to move top of the first division table for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, with 23 points. In the process, it recorded seven straight wins after drawing its first two games. The club eventually finished sixth after defeating Athletic Bilbao 3–0 at home in its last match, thus qualifying for the UEFA Europa League for the first time in its history. There, they made it to the last 16 before a 2–0 extra-time loss to Russia&#x27;s FC Rubin Kazan.

In the 2015–16 season, Levante was relegated after defeat by Málaga and finished last. The club was promoted back to the top league in 2016–17, winning the Segunda División title. In the 2017–18 season, the club secured safety in the league and on 13 May, beat the champions Barcelona 5–4 (having led 5–1 early in the second half), with Emmanuel Boateng scoring his first ever career hat-trick. This win ended Barcelona&#x27;s hopes of achieving an unbeaten season.

In the 2021–22 season, Levante was relegated after being defeated 0–6 by Real Madrid, ending their five years in the top tier.

==Stadium==

&quot;Estadi Ciutat de València&quot; was opened on 9 September 1969, with capacity for 25,354 spectators. The pitch measures 107 by 69 metres.

Due to the 2019–20 season&#x27;s late finish because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and renovation work at their stadium, Levante concluded the campaign behind closed doors at the &quot;Estadi Olímpic Camilo Cano&quot; in La Nucia, Province of Alicante.

==Rivals==

Levante contest the &quot;Derbi Valenciano&quot;, also known as the &quot;Derbi del Turia&quot; or &quot;Derbi Valentino&quot;, with local rivals Valencia. The fixture has been played 38 times competitively, with Valencia winning 21 times to Levante&#x27;s 8.

<text>Pendolino (from Italian &quot;pendolo&quot; &quot;pendulum&quot;, and &quot;-ino,&quot; a diminutive suffix) is an Italian family of high-speed tilting trains (and non-tilting) used in Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia (Czech railways are operating), the UK, the US, Switzerland, China, and Greece. It was also used in Russia from December 12, 2010 until March 26, 2022. Based on the design of the Italian ETR 401 (itself utilising technologies developed for the British Rail APT-E), it was further developed and manufactured by Fiat Ferroviaria, which was taken over by Alstom in 2000.

The idea of a tilting train became popular in the 1960s and 1970s, when various rail operators, impressed by the high-speed rail services being introduced in France and Japan, wondered how they could similarly speed up travel without building a dedicated parallel rail network (as those two countries were doing). By tilting, the train could go around curves designed for slower trains at higher speeds without causing undue discomfort to passengers.

== Current use ==
=== Italy ===

In Italy, various possibilities were explored (including one early design for fixed carriages with tilting seats). A number of prototypes were built and tested, including an &quot;automotrice&quot; (self-propelled) derived from ALn 668 diesel car and provided with tilting seats. The first working prototype using a tilting carbody was ETR Y 0160, an electrically powered car launched by Fiat in 1969. This was the first to be christened &quot;Pendolino&quot;.

It led to the construction of a whole EMU in 1975, the ETR 401, built in two units by FIAT. One was put into public service on 2 July 1976 on the Rome-Ancona (later extended to Rimini) line, operated by Italian State Railways. Between Roma and Ancona (km. 295) the train took 2 hours and 50 minutes while the ordinary trains took 3 hours and 30 minutes. The train had four cars and was mostly considered a travelling laboratory for the new technology. The second unit was adapted for service to the broad gauge Renfe Spanish lines.

In 1982, FS retired the ETR 401 from service, due to high maintenance cost, and FIAT transformed it in a train-laboratory, to test the parts for the successor of the ETR 401, ETR 450. After 1988, the trainset went around Europe to demonstrate the greatness of the tilting revolutionary technology and between 1994 and 2001 it was utilised as a charter train. In 2001 the ETR 401 was put aside in Ancona and since 2013, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the first official pendolino service, it has been partly restored.

On 29 May 1988, the ETR 450 became the first pendolino to enter in a high-speed regular service in the world. The project of the new train was similar to its predecessor, utilising many electronic parts, such as the chopper and the automatic gear.
Characterized by a nine-car configuration, the 15 ETR 450 trainsets could run the Rome-Milan line in under four hours, at speeds up to , with a comfort level same as the best TEE&#x27;s cars at the speed of . Passenger numbers increased from 220,000 in 1988 to 2.2million in 1993.

In 1994, the next generation, the ETR 460, styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, began service. Though plagued by technical teething problems, the ETR 460 introduced several innovations, such as more powerful AC asynchronous motors. Further, the pistons actuating the anti-tilting action were placed in the bogie instead of on the carbody sides: this permitted the reorganisation of the vestibules and passenger compartment areas, improving comfort. The bogie-to-body connection is extremely simple and easy to make, with clear advantages for maintenance.

ETR 460 keeps axle load to an extremely low level (14.5ton/axle) to allow the train to negotiate curves up to 35% faster than conventional intercity trains (loco plus coaches). The body, which exploits large aluminium extrusion technology, has substantial modularity and allows for extremely low axle weight, whilst fully respecting the highest safety standards, and allows the best exploitation of the space with different loading gauges.

Fiat Ferroviaria built only ten ETR 460 trainsets. Improved versions include nine ETR 470 built for the Italo-Swiss Cisalpino company and 15 ETR 480 / 485 used by Trenitalia under AC lines such as those in France and Switzerland. A total of 34 EMUs of the ETR 460/470/480 - 485 series were built.

Fiat Ferroviaria was sold to Alstom in 2000. The development of the Pendolino technology continued in Alstom&#x27;s Italian factories and the next generation, the New Pendolino, was delivered to Trenitalia and Cisalpino, as the ETR 600 and the ETR 610, from 2006.

=== Spain ===
Even before the first Pendolino EMU was built in Italy, in 1972, Fiat and Renfe signed an agreement for cooperation in tilting-train development. The first fruit of the cooperation was the equipment of a Renfe Class 432 EMU with the active tilting suspension in September 1972. After successful tests, Spanish trainmaker CAF and Fiat built a prototype similar to the ETR 401, which was delivered in 1976 as Renfe Class 443, nicknamed &quot;Platanito&quot; (Little banana) for its yellow livery. The four-car train had a commercial top speed of and achieved a then speed record for Spain of on 6 May 1987. However, the train remained a unique specimen, as Renfe favoured the entirely domestic Talgo Pendular, a tilting train with passive suspension introduced in 1980. After revenue service in 1979–1982, the train was used for charter and test runs.
Two decades later, to speed up services along its Madrid-Valencia conventional line, Renfe ordered ten Pendolini in 1996. The trains, based on the ETR 460 and ETR 470, were delivered by a joint consortium of Fiat Ferroviaria and GEC-Alsthom from 1998 as Renfe Class 490. The three-car trains are suited for on Renfe&#x27;s conventional lines electrified with 3 kV DC. The Class 490 took up the new Madrid-Valencia Alaris services in 1999. With growing demand, the capacity of the Class 490 was no longer sufficient, and from February 2008, the trains were transferred to the Mediterráneo line between Valencia and Barcelona.

For medium-distance services along its high-speed lines, Renfe ordered a non-tilting variant of the Pendolino, based on the ETR 480, in 2001. The 20 four-car trains with a service top speed of were built jointly by Alstom and CAF and delivered as the Renfe Class 104. Renfe deployed them for the new Avant services along the Madrid–Seville high-speed rail line, starting 29 December 2004.

Renfe ordered another 30 non-tilting medium-distance high-speed trains from Alstom/CAF in a follow-on order, which was later reduced to 13 units. However, these trains are based on the New Pendolino design. The first train of the new class designated Renfe Class 114 was presented in autumn 2008. Most of them are used in services along the Madrid–Valladolid high-speed line.

=== Germany ===

The West German federal railways DB experimented with tilting technology in the 1970s, but abandoned it. Then in 1987, DB commissioned a study on whether electrification or purchasing diesel tilting trains would be the better option for the Nuremberg-Hof line, and decided for the latter. In 1988, DB ordered ten tilting DMUs, and another ten in 1990. All 20 trains of the new DB Class 610 were delivered in 1992. The two-car trains with a top speed of were produced by a consortium of five German companies and Fiat Ferroviaria. Fiat supplied the bogies, the hydraulic tilting suspension, and the other parts of the tilting technology, thus the trains could be called &quot;Pendolino&quot; (a Fiat trademarked brand name).

Deutsche Bahn ordered more regional and express tilting DMUs with other technology (class 611 and class 612: Adtranz/Bombardier, ICE TD/class 605: Siemens). However, for the electric ICE T trains ordered in 1994 for service on conventional lines, Pendolino technology was chosen again. Fiat (Alstom) supplied the bogies and tilting technology for the 32 seven-car class 411 and 11 five-car class 415 express trains that entered service from 1999. In 2002, DB placed another order for slightly modified class 411 trains, Alstom Ferroviaria was again supplier of bogies and tilt technology when the 28 trains were delivered from 2004 to 2006.

=== Switzerland ===

Since the failure of Cisalpino, a joint venture between the Italian Trenitalia and the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the Pendolinos used for transalpine transport between Switzerland and Italy, on the Gotthard and Lötschberg axis routes, were split between Trenitalia (five ETR 470 and seven ETR 610) and SBB (four ETR 470 and seven ETR 610). The low reliability of the timetable and of the ETR 470 has led SBB and Trenitalia to always have a reserve train ready at each terminus of the Milan-Zürich route.

In 2012, SBB ordered eight new ETR 610 with delivery in 2015 to be operated on the Milan - Geneva and Milan - Zürich routes.

=== Finland ===

The Finnish model, the class Sm3, is based on the ETR 460 but was adapted to the specific requirements of VR Group (formerly the Finnish State Railways) and to the cold climatic conditions. The first two units were assembled in 1995 by Rautaruukki-Transtech. A total of sixteen additional units were purchased from Alstom and shipped to Finland between 2000 and 2006. Sm3 trains operate from Helsinki to the cities of Turku, Tampere, Jyväskylä, Oulu, Kouvola, Joensuu and Vaasa.

The trains are composed of six carriages. Four cars are fitted with two asynchronous three-phase AC motors (one for each bogie); two are unpowered but are fitted with pantographs. One of these coaches is a restaurant carriage. The motors deliver a continuous power of and propel the train at a maximum speed of .

The Sm3 has received a lot of bad publicity in Finland for its reliability issues, mostly caused by technical problems in cold weather with the tilting system and couplers. VR has tried to mitigate the problem by coupling trains only at termini instead of intermediate stations and switching the tilting system off during winter. The trains were expected to receive significant maintenance between 2012 and 2014, to improve reliability of couplers and the tilting system.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal the Pendolino is named Alfa Pendular and is operated by the Portuguese state railway company CP. It connects the cities of Guimarães, Braga, Porto, Aveiro, Coimbra, Santarém, Lisbon, Albufeira and Faro, among others, and has a top speed of . The bogies had to be redesigned for operation on Portugal&#x27;s broad gauge track, and the trains were assembled by Adtranz Portugal at the Amadora plant (former Sorefame). Main contractor was Fiat Ferroviaria later acquired by Alstom with two main subcontractors Adtranz and Siemens that was responsible for the traction and train control.

Ten six-car train sets were produced between 1998 and 2001, with commercial operation from early 1999. Based on the ETR 460 the Portuguese Pendolino differs mainly from its predecessor from the carbody width that takes advantage of the Iberian gauge .

=== Slovenia ===

Slovenian Railways ordered three Pendolino tilting trains for its main lines. The three-car trains, delivered as SŽ series 310, were derived from the ETR 460. The series 310 can reach a maximum speed of , but in revenue service on the Slovenian railway network, the maximum it reaches is between Maribor and Pragersko stations, as well as between Grobelno and Celje stations.

Since 24 September 2000, the series 310 runs the InterCitySlovenija (ICS) service, linking the major cities of Slovenia in one line: Ljubljana, Zidani Most, Celje and Maribor, with a frequent service that acts as a high-speed shuttle. Until April 2008, once per day the route from Maribor to Ljubljana was extended as international train to Venice via Monfalcone serving Trieste.

Train offers 1st and 2nd class and on-board bar. 1st Class offers leather seats in 1-2 configuration, 220 V Power Outlet (all seats), Wi-Fi, electric blind, recline (By moving lower part forward you may recline by 15&quot;), every seat has a table which can be extended to (100 cm x 80 cm) for business meetings or eating, air conditioning outlet, reading light and wider seats (20 cm). 2nd Class offers plush seats in 2-2 configuration, 220 V power outlet (Some seats), Wi-Fi, electric blinds, foot rest (most seats), most have a tray table and some have a conference table which can extend to (100 cm x 80 cm) for working or eating, air conditioning outlet and a reading light.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1999, 53 Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; were ordered by Virgin Trains West Coast to operate services on the West Coast Main Line in the United Kingdom. All were built by Alstom with the body shells built at its Savigliano factory in Italy and fitted out at its former Metro-Cammell factory in Washwood Heath in Birmingham, England.

Owing to cutbacks by Railtrack to the West Coast Main Line upgrade to provide in-cab signalling, these are limited in service to operation rather than their design speed.

In 2008, the Department for Transport announced that 31 of the existing nine-car sets would be lengthened to 11 cars to increase capacity. Four new 11-car sets were also to be built. The longer units required major infrastructure changes to allow stations and depots to accommodate the 11-car units. With the closure of the Washwood Heath works, the additional vehicles were manufactured at Savigliano. The first new sets were built with 11 cars and delivered in December 2010. The lengthening project was completed in December 2012.

In the early 1980s, British Rail had planned to bring tilting train technology to the same line with the Class 370 &quot;Advanced Passenger Train&quot; project. Technical problems caused by pressure to launch the service early and lack of the political will to provide sufficient funding to overcome them forced the abandonment of this early attempt, although much of the technology was used to design and build Pendolino trains.

On 23 February 2007, a Virgin Trains Pendolino train derailed in the Grayrigg rail crash, Virgin chairman Richard Branson credited the robust construction of the Pendolino with saving lives in the crash. Although only some carriages were damaged, the damage was beyond economical repair and the set was written off.

All remaining 56 sets passed to Avanti West Coast with the West Coast Partnership franchise in December 2019.

=== Czech Republic ===
In 1995 consortium consisting of ČKD, MSV Studénka, FIAT Ferroviaria and Siemens won tender for the construction of ten tilting trains for the Czech Railways ČD, intended for international service Berlin - Prague - Vienna. After ČKD bankruptcy in 2000, Alstom (as the new owner of FIAT Ferroviaria) took over whole order, reducing number of sets to seven and raising total price, while provided an improved version of ETR 470, equipped to work on , and 3,000VDC, thus suitable to operate in Germany, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The first set was delivered in 2004 as Pendolino ČD 680. While testing between Brno and Břeclav on 18 November 2004, the Pendolino reached a speed of and created a new Czech railway speed record.

During the testing period, the train had problems with the Czech signalling system. The problems were said to be solved and the trains entered regular service in December 2005 between Prague and Ostrava. As of late January 2006, all five Czech Pendolino trains in service suffered from software and functional problems, which were later fixed, but the trains still did not receive permission to operate abroad. In December 2006, the trains were given permission to operate in Slovakia and Austria, but as of 2010 permission for Germany has not yet been granted.

A Czech Pendolino train appeared in the 2006 James Bond film&quot; Casino Royale&quot; and in Timur Bekmambetov&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Wanted&quot; starring Angelina Jolie.

=== Slovakia ===
Czech Railways ČD has been operating Pendolino as an international train between the Czech Republic and Slovakia for many years. At first it started operating trains from Prague to Bratislava in December 2005 and later also trains from Prague to Košice in December 2014. The connection to Bratislava ended in 2015.

=== Poland ===

Polish state railways PKP ordered 14 Pendolinos in 1998, but the order was cancelled in 2000 due to a shortage of funds.

In 2010, Alstom won a PKP Intercity tender for high-speed trains with an offer of 20 New Pendolino trains. Similarly to the CRH5, these are non-tilting. Like the ČD class 680, the Pendolinos are equipped to operate on 15kV 16·7 Hz and 25kV 50 Hz as well as 3kVDC for operation in Poland, and have the train control systems needed to operate in Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. However, certification for international operation is not seen as a priority, as the trains are restricted to domestic services for an initial ten years under the terms of a grant from the EU Cohesion Fund which covered 22% of the project cost.

On 30 May 2011 the Polish state railways PKP signed an agreement with Alstom for 20 Pendolinos ETR 610 for delivery in 2014. The first Pendolino was delivered on 12 August 2013. Each seven-car Class ED250 trainset has seats for 57 first class and 345 second class passengers, with a buffet/bar and three four-seat business or family compartments. The Pendolinos were to operate on the high-speed &#x27;CMK&#x27; Central Rail Line from Kraków/Katowice to Warsaw, and on the routes from Gdynia to Warsaw and from Wrocław to Warsaw.

High speed tests using the new Pendolino ED250 on the CMK began in November 2013. On the first day of tests, 16 November, the Pendolino reached . On 17 November 2013, a new speed record for Polish railways was set at km 184.000 of the CMK when Pendolino ED250 reached a speed of , breaking the 19-year record of . On 24 November 2013, the final day of tests on the CMK the Pendolino reached .

The contract between the Polish operator PKP Intercity and Alstom called for the first eight Pendolino ED250 trainsets to be delivered on 6 May 2014, tested (&#x27;homologated&#x27;) for operation at using ETCS L2 signalling. The tests had not been performed by May, and PKP announced that Alstom had failed to meet the contract terms and would be charged penalties as of 6 May. Alstom responded that homologation in Poland at 250km/h using ETCS L2 was impossible, since ETCS L2 was not operational anywhere in Poland, and the CMK where the first ED250 Pendolino had reached in testing was equipped with ETCS Level 1, not Level 2. On 26 June 2014, a compromise was reached between PKP and Alstom under which the Pendolinos would be delivered under a two-stage homologation, first homologated for operation using ETCS Level 1 and eventually to be homologated for ETCS Level 2. The Pendolinos were put in service on 14 December 2014.

In addition to the CMK from Warsaw to Kraków and Katowice, and from Warsaw to Wrocław, the Pendolinos also operate on the route from Warsaw to Gdańsk and Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. In 2011-2015 the Warsaw-Gdańsk-Gdynia route underwent a major upgrading costing $3billion, partly funded by the European Investment Bank, including track replacement, realignment of curves and relocation of sections of track to allow speeds up to , and modernization of stations. Installation of ETCS L2 was under way in 2016. When Pendolino services started on 14 December 2014 the previous Warsaw–Gdańsk rail travel time of 4-1/2 to 6hours was reduced to 2hours 58minutes by Pendolino, and reduced further to 2hours 39minutes in December 2015.

Introduction of the fast, modern Pendolinos in December 2014, had a major effect on rail ridership in Poland. In the first five months of 2015, Warsaw–Kraków rail ridership rose by 50 percent. In May 2015 alone, Warsaw–Kraków ridership was 70 percent higher than a year earlier.

After the initial delays Polish Pendolinos were upgraded to provide the access to wireless internet. As of September 2021, all 19 trainsets actually operating have got the equipment installed.

=== China ===

China Railway High-speed (CRH) purchased technologies from Alstom to assemble 60 sets of high speed EMU trains, which have been named CRH5 and are based on the New Pendolino trains. The CRH5 are non-tilting trains. Thirty additional sets were ordered in 2009 and 20 additional sets was ordered in 2010 to complete the current fleet operating on China&#x27;s northern and eastern lines.

=== United States ===

In August 2016, Amtrak and Alstom unveiled the new Avelia Liberty that will take passengers between Washington, D.C., and Boston as part of a Northeast Corridor rehabilitation project starting in 2021, replacing the aged Acela Express. The train has safety features that comply with Federal Railroad Administration standards, along with greater comfort, more capacity, built in Wi-Fi, Tiltronix, and with speeds up to .

=== Greece ===
In 2019, Greek railway operator company TrainOSE, a subsidiary of Italian company Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane, purchased 5 ETR 470 high-speed trains, previously used on Frecciabianca railway services in Italy, to be deployed on the Athens-Thessaloniki high-speed railway. The trains originally had 3 kV DC equipment, which was replaced by 25 kV 50 Hz equipment, to match Greek railway standards and were fitted with ETCS onboard equipment. The first unit arrived in Greece in January 2021. Express passenger services started in early 2022 on the Athens-Thessaloniki mainline.

== Past use ==

===Russia===

Karelian Trains, a 50-50 joint venture between Finnish VR and Russian Railways, operated four 1522 mm gauge seven-car Pendolinos for use on Saint Petersburg–Helsinki services. Branded &quot;Allegro&quot; (). Service started on December 12, 2010, reducing travel time between the cities from five and a half hours to three and a half hours at first and later to three hours. The bogies are specially constructed to allow for speed both at the Finnish gauge and the Russian gauge .

The service between Helsinki, Finland, and St. Petersburg, Russia, was suspended on March 27, 2022, as per VR&#x27;s announcement that operating a connection between Russia and Finland no longer served a purpose due to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.

On December 14, 2023, the Finnish VR announced that it had acquired ownership of the Allegro equipment from Karelian Trains and will move the Allegro trains to domestic service away from serving cross-border connections between Finland and Russia. This marked the end of the use of Pendolino trains in Russia. According to VR&#x27;s assessment, the former Allegro trains will enter service on domestic Finnish routes approximately in 2025 after undergoing repairs.

== Cancelled orders ==
In 1998, CFR of Romania announced its intent to order two Pendolinos by the end of the year, and wanted to sign another agreement about the local production of 19 more units under a license agreement the next year. However, these plans were not followed up.

In 2002, ZSSK of Slovakia considered purchasing four Pendolinos, in close cooperation with ČD of the Czech Republic. The trains were to run as ZSSK class 650. This project was given up in 2004 for lack of funds.

The Ukrainian Railways announced its intent to buy seven Pendolinos for the UEFA Euro 2012 in 2008, but failed to secure the financing later on. Consequentially, in 2011, ten South Korean-built HRCS2 trains were later purchased by Ukraine.

<text>ZNetwork, formerly known as Z Communications, is a left-wing activist-oriented media group founded in 1986 by Michael Albert and Lydia Sargent. It is, in broad terms, ideologically libertarian socialist, anti-capitalist, and heavily influenced by participatory economics, although much of its content is focused on critical commentary of foreign affairs. Its publications include &quot;Z Magazine&quot;, &quot;ZNet&quot;, and &quot;Z Video&quot;. Since early November 2022, they have all been regrouped under the name &quot;ZNetwork&quot;.

== History ==
Zeta Magazine was founded by Michael Albert and Lydia Sargent in 1987, both of whom had previously co-founded South End Press. It was renamed Z Magazine in 1989. 

Founded in 1994, Z Media Institute provides classes and other sessions in how to start and produce alternative media, how to better understand media, and how to develop organising skills. The institute has hosted Stephen Shalom presentations on parpolity a number of times.

Founded in 1995, ZNet (also known as &quot;ZNet&quot;, &quot;ZNetwork&quot; and &quot;Z Communications&quot;) is a website with contributors that include Noam Chomsky, Eduardo Galeano, Boris Kagarlitsky, Edward Said, Chris Spannos and Kevin Zeese. John Pilger described it as one of the best news sources online. Rene Milan of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies called the site a rich source of information about participism.

== Publications and authors ==
&quot;Z Magazine&quot; is published in print and on-line monthly.
Contributors to the magazine have included Patrick Bond Noam Chomsky, Ward Churchill, Alexander Cockburn, Edward S. Herman, bell hooks, Mike Kuhlenbeck, Staughton Lynd, John Ross, Juliet Schor, Holly Sklar, Cornel West, Kevin Zeese and Howard Zinn. Articles written by Chomsky have been republished in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

== Criticism ==
In a 2005 interview with Joshua Frank, Ward Churchill discussed issues he had with &quot;Z Magazine&quot;. Churchill claimed an article he worked on was not published for two years and was misattributed. He also felt Albert and Sargent had greater influence than others involved with the publication. 

In 2012, George Monbiot criticized the site&#x27;s defence of the book &quot;The Politics of Genocide&quot; by Edward S. Herman and David Peterson, which he said had been called a work of genocide denial by scholars he had consulted such as Martin Shaw.

<doc id="267355" wikidata="Q1377033" url="?curid=267355" title="Game tree">
<text>In the context of combinatorial game theory, a game tree is a graph representing all possible game states within a sequential game that has perfect information. Such games include chess, checkers, Go, and tic-tac-toe.

A game tree can be used to measure the complexity of a game, as it represents all the possible ways that the game can pan out. Due to the large game trees of complex games such as chess, algorithms that are designed to play this class of games will use partial game trees, which makes computation feasible on modern computers. Various methods exist to solve game trees. If a complete game tree can be generated, a deterministic algorithm, such as backward induction or retrograde analysis can be used. Randomized algorithms and minmax algorithms such as MCTS can be used in cases where a complete game tree is not feasible.

== Understanding the game tree ==
To better understand the game tree, it can be thought of as a technique for analyzing adversarial games, which determine the actions that player takes to win the game. In game theory, a game tree is a directed graph whose nodes are positions in a game (e.g., the arrangement of the pieces in a board game) and whose edges are moves (e.g., to move pieces from one position on a board to another).

The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position and containing all possible moves from each position; the complete tree is the same tree as that obtained from the extensive-form game representation. To be more specific, the complete game is a norm for the game in game theory. Which can clearly express many important aspects. For example, the sequence of actions that stakeholders may take, their choices at each decision point, information about actions taken by other stakeholders when each stakeholder makes a decision, and the benefits of all possible game results.

The number of leaf nodes in the complete game tree is the number of possible different ways the game can be played. For example, the game tree for tic-tac-toe has 255,168 leaf nodes.

Game trees are important in artificial intelligence because one way to pick the best move in a game is to search the game tree using any of numerous tree search algorithms, combined with minimax-like rules to prune the tree. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is easily searchable, but the complete game trees for larger games like chess are much too large to search. Instead, a chess-playing program searches a partial game tree: typically as many plies from the current position as it can search in the time available. Except for the case of &quot;pathological&quot; game trees (which seem to be quite rare in practice), increasing the search depth (i.e., the number of plies searched) generally improves the chance of picking the best move.

Two-person games can also be represented as and-or trees. For the first player to win a game, there must exist a winning move for all moves of the second player. This is represented in the and-or tree by using disjunction to represent the first player&#x27;s alternative moves and using conjunction to represent all of the second player&#x27;s moves.

==Solving game trees==

===Deterministic algorithm version===

With a complete game tree, it is possible to &quot;solve&quot; the game – that is to say, find a sequence of moves that either the first or second player can follow that will guarantee the best possible outcome for that player (usually a win or a tie). The deterministic algorithm (which is generally called backward induction or retrograde analysis) can be described recursively as follows.

# Color the final ply of the game tree so that all wins for player 1 are colored one way (Blue in the diagram), all wins for player 2 are colored another way (Red in the diagram), and all ties are colored a third way (Grey in the diagram). 
# Look at the next ply up. If there exists a node colored opposite as the current player, color this node for that player as well. If all immediately lower nodes are colored for the same player, color this node for the same player as well. Otherwise, color this node a tie.
# Repeat for each ply, moving upwards, until all nodes are colored. The color of the root node will determine the nature of the game.

The diagram shows a game tree for an arbitrary game, colored using the above algorithm.

It is usually possible to solve a game (in this technical sense of &quot;solve&quot;) using only a subset of the game tree, since in many games a move need not be analyzed if there is another move that is better for the same player (for example alpha-beta pruning can be used in many deterministic games).

Any subtree that can be used to solve the game is known as a decision tree, and the sizes of decision trees of various shapes are used as measures of game complexity.

===Randomized algorithms version===
Randomized algorithms can be used in solving game trees. There are two main advantages in this type of implementation: speed and practicality. Whereas a deterministic version of solving game trees can be done in , the following randomized algorithm has an expected run time of if every node in the game tree has degree 2. Moreover, it is practical because randomized algorithms are capable of &quot;foiling an enemy&quot;, meaning an opponent cannot beat the system of game trees by knowing the algorithm used to solve the game tree because the order of solving is random.

The following is an implementation of randomized game tree solution algorithm:
def gt_eval_rand(u) -&gt; bool:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns True if this node evaluates to a win, otherwise False&quot;&quot;&quot;
 if u.leaf:
 return u.win
 else:
 random_children = (gt_eval_rand(child) for child in random_order(u.children))
 if u.op == &quot;OR&quot;:
 return any(random_children)
 if u.op == &quot;AND&quot;:
 return all(random_children)
The algorithm makes use of the idea of &quot;short-circuiting&quot;: if the root node is considered an &quot; operator, then once one is found, the root is classified as ; conversely, if the root node is considered an &quot; operator then once one is found, the root is classified as .

<text>In astronomy, seeing is the degradation of the image of an astronomical object due to turbulence in the atmosphere of Earth that may become visible as blurring, twinkling or variable distortion. The origin of this effect is rapidly changing variations of the optical refractive index along the light path from the object to the detector.
Seeing is a major limitation to the angular resolution in astronomical observations with telescopes that would otherwise be limited through diffraction by the size of the telescope aperture.
Today, many large scientific ground-based optical telescopes include adaptive optics to overcome seeing.

The strength of seeing is often characterized by the angular diameter of the long-exposure image of a star (&quot;seeing disk&quot;) or by the Fried parameter &quot;r&quot;0. The diameter of the seeing disk is the full width at half maximum of its optical intensity. An exposure time of several tens of milliseconds can be considered &quot;long&quot; in this context. The Fried parameter describes the size of an imaginary telescope aperture for which the diffraction limited angular resolution is equal to the resolution limited by seeing. Both the size of the seeing disc and the Fried parameter depend on the optical wavelength, but it is common to specify them for 500 nanometers.
A seeing disk smaller than 0.4 arcseconds or a Fried parameter larger than 30 centimeters can be considered excellent seeing. The best conditions are typically found at high-altitude observatories on small islands, such as those at Mauna Kea or La Palma.

== Effects ==

Astronomical seeing has several effects:
# It causes the images of point sources (such as stars), which in the absence of atmospheric turbulence would be steady Airy patterns produced by diffraction, to break up into speckle patterns, which change very rapidly with time (the resulting speckled images can be processed using speckle imaging)
# Long exposure images of these changing speckle patterns result in a blurred image of the point source, called a &quot;seeing disc&quot;
# The brightness of stars appears to fluctuate in a process known as scintillation or twinkling
# Atmospheric seeing causes the fringes in an astronomical interferometer to move rapidly
# The distribution of atmospheric seeing through the atmosphere (the CN2 profile described below) causes the image quality in adaptive optics systems to degrade the further you look from the location of reference star

The effects of atmospheric seeing were indirectly responsible for the belief that there were canals on Mars. In viewing a bright object such as Mars, occasionally a still patch of air will come in front of the planet, resulting in a brief moment of clarity. Before the use of charge-coupled devices, there was no way of recording the image of the planet in the brief moment other than having the observer remember the image and draw it later. This had the effect of having the image of the planet be dependent on the observer&#x27;s memory and preconceptions which led the belief that Mars had linear features.

The effects of atmospheric seeing are qualitatively similar throughout the visible and near infrared wavebands. At large telescopes the long exposure image resolution is generally slightly higher at longer wavelengths, and the timescale (&quot;t&quot;0 - see below) for the changes in the dancing speckle patterns is substantially lower.

== Measures ==
There are three common descriptions of the astronomical seeing conditions at an observatory:
* The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the seeing disc
* &quot;r&quot;0 (the size of a typical &quot;lump&quot; of uniform air within the turbulent atmosphere) and &quot;t&quot;0 (the time-scale over which the changes in the turbulence become significant)
*The CN2 profile

These are described in the sub-sections below:

=== The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the seeing disc ===
Without an atmosphere, a small star would have an apparent size, an &quot;Airy disk&quot;, in a telescope image determined by diffraction and would be inversely proportional to the diameter of the telescope. However, when light enters the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the different temperature layers and different wind speeds distort the light waves, leading to distortions in the image of a star. The effects of the atmosphere can be modeled as rotating cells of air moving turbulently. At most observatories, the turbulence is only significant on scales larger than &quot;r&quot;0 (see below—the seeing parameter &quot;r&quot;0 is 10–20 cm at visible wavelengths under the best conditions) and this limits the resolution of telescopes to be about the same as given by a space-based 10–20 cm telescope.

The distortion changes at a high rate, typically more frequently than 100 times a second. In a typical astronomical image of a star with an exposure time of seconds or even minutes, the different distortions average out as a filled disc called the &quot;seeing disc&quot;. The diameter of the seeing disk, most often defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM), is a measure of the astronomical seeing conditions.

It follows from this definition that seeing is always a variable quantity, different from place to place, from night to night, and even variable on a scale of minutes. Astronomers often talk about &quot;good&quot; nights with a low average seeing disc diameter, and &quot;bad&quot; nights where the seeing diameter was so high that all observations were worthless.

The FWHM of the seeing disc (or just &quot;seeing&quot;) is usually measured in arcseconds, abbreviated with the symbol (″). A 1.0″ seeing is a good one for average astronomical sites. The seeing of an urban environment is usually much worse. Good seeing nights tend to be clear, cold nights without wind gusts. Warm air rises (convection), degrading the seeing, as do wind and clouds. At the best high-altitude mountaintop observatories, the wind brings in stable air which has not previously been in contact with the ground, sometimes providing seeing as good as 0.4&quot;.

=== &quot;r&quot;0 and &quot;t&quot;0 ===
The astronomical seeing conditions at an observatory can be conveniently described by the parameters &quot;r&quot;0 and &quot;t&quot;0.

For telescopes with diameters smaller than &quot;r&quot;0, the resolution of long-exposure images is determined primarily by diffraction and the size of the Airy pattern and thus is inversely proportional to the telescope diameter.

For telescopes with diameters larger than &quot;r&quot;0, the image resolution is determined primarily by the atmosphere and is independent of telescope diameter, remaining constant at the value given by a telescope of diameter equal to &quot;r&quot;0. &quot;r&quot;0 also corresponds to the length-scale over which the turbulence becomes significant (10–20 cm at visible wavelengths at good observatories), and &quot;t&quot;0 corresponds to the time-scale over which the changes in the turbulence become significant. &quot;r&quot;0 determines the spacing of the actuators needed in an adaptive optics system, and &quot;t&quot;0 determines the correction speed required to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere.

The parameters &quot;r&quot;0 and &quot;t&quot;0 vary with the wavelength used for the astronomical imaging, allowing slightly higher resolution imaging at longer wavelengths using large telescopes.

The seeing parameter &quot;r&quot;0 is often known as the Fried parameter, named after David L. Fried. The atmospheric time constant &quot;t&quot;0 is often referred to as the Greenwood time constant, after Darryl Greenwood.

==== Mathematical description of &quot;r&quot;0 and &quot;t&quot;0 ====


Mathematical models can give an accurate model of the effects of astronomical seeing on images taken through ground-based telescopes. Three simulated short-exposure images are shown at the right through three different telescope diameters (as negative images to highlight the fainter features more clearly—a common astronomical convention). The telescope diameters are quoted in terms of the Fried parameter formula_1 (defined below). formula_1 is a commonly used measurement of the astronomical seeing at observatories. At visible wavelengths, formula_1 varies from 20 cm at the best locations to 5 cm at typical sea-level sites.

In reality, the pattern of blobs (&quot;speckles&quot;) in the images changes very rapidly, so that long-exposure photographs would just show a single large blurred blob in the center for each telescope diameter. The diameter (FWHM) of the large blurred blob in long-exposure images is called the seeing disc diameter, and is independent of the telescope diameter used (as long as adaptive optics correction is not applied).

It is first useful to give a brief overview of the basic theory of optical propagation through the atmosphere. In the standard classical theory, light is treated as an oscillation in a field formula_4. For monochromatic plane waves arriving from a distant point source with wave-vector formula_5:
formula_6
where formula_7 is the complex field at position formula_8 and
time formula_9, with real and imaginary parts corresponding to the electric and magnetic field components, formula_10 represents a phase offset,
formula_11 is the frequency of the light determined by formula_12, and formula_13 is the amplitude of the light.

The photon flux in this case is proportional to the square of the amplitude formula_13, and the optical phase corresponds to the complex argument of formula_7. As wavefronts pass through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere they may be perturbed by refractive index variations in the atmosphere. The diagram at the top-right of this page shows schematically a turbulent layer in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere perturbing planar wavefronts before they enter a telescope. The perturbed wavefront formula_16 may be related at any given instant to the original planar wavefront formula_17 in the following way:
formula_18
where formula_19 represents the fractional change in wavefront amplitude and formula_20
is the change in wavefront phase introduced by the atmosphere. It is important to emphasise that formula_19 and formula_20 describe the effect of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and the timescales for any changes in these functions will be set by the speed of refractive index fluctuations in the atmosphere.

==== The Kolmogorov model of turbulence ====
A description of the nature of the wavefront perturbations introduced by the atmosphere is provided by the Kolmogorov model developed by Tatarski, based partly on the studies of turbulence by the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov. This model is supported by a variety of experimental measurements and is widely used in simulations of astronomical imaging. The model assumes that the
wavefront perturbations are brought about by variations in the refractive index of the atmosphere. These refractive index variations lead directly to phase fluctuations described by formula_20, but any amplitude fluctuations are only brought about as a second-order effect while the perturbed wavefronts propagate from the perturbing atmospheric layer to the telescope. For all reasonable models of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at optical and
infrared wavelengths the instantaneous imaging performance is dominated by the phase fluctuations formula_20. The amplitude fluctuations described by formula_19 have negligible effect on the structure of the images seen in the focus of a large telescope.

For simplicity, the phase fluctuations in Tatarski&#x27;s model are often assumed to have a Gaussian random distribution with the following second-order structure function:
formula_26
where formula_27 is the atmospherically induced variance between the phase at two parts of the wavefront separated by a distance formula_28 in the aperture plane, and formula_29 represents the ensemble average.

For the Gaussian random approximation, the structure function of Tatarski (1961) can be described in terms of a single parameter formula_1:
formula_31
formula_1 indicates the &quot;strength&quot; of the phase fluctuations as it corresponds to the diameter of a circular telescope aperture at which atmospheric phase perturbations begin to seriously limit the image resolution. Typical formula_1 values for I band (900 nm wavelength) observations at good sites are 20–40 cm. formula_1 also corresponds to the aperture diameter for which the variance formula_35 of the wavefront phase averaged over the aperture comes approximately to unity:
formula_36

This equation represents a commonly used definition for formula_1, a parameter frequently used to describe the atmospheric conditions at astronomical observatories.

formula_1 can be determined from a measured CN2 profile (described below) as follows:
formula_39
where the turbulence strength formula_40 varies as a function of height formula_41 above the telescope, and formula_42 is the angular distance of the astronomical source from the zenith (from directly overhead).

If turbulent evolution is assumed to occur on slow timescales, then the timescale &quot;t&quot;0 is simply proportional to &quot;r&quot;0 divided by the mean wind speed.

The refractive index fluctuations caused by Gaussian random turbulence can be simulated using the following algorithm:
formula_43
where formula_44 is the optical phase error introduced by atmospheric turbulence, R (k) is a two-dimensional square array of independent random complex numbers which have a Gaussian distribution about zero and white noise spectrum, K (k) is the (real) Fourier amplitude expected from the Kolmogorov (or Von Karman) spectrum, Re[] represents taking the real part, and FT[] represents a discrete Fourier transform of the resulting two-dimensional square array (typically an FFT).

==== Turbulent intermittency ====
The assumption that the phase fluctuations in Tatarski&#x27;s model have a Gaussian random distribution is usually unrealistic. In reality, turbulence exhibits intermittency.

These fluctuations in the turbulence strength can be straightforwardly simulated as follows:
formula_45
where is a two-dimensional array which represents the spectrum of intermittency, with the same dimensions as , and where formula_46 represents convolution. The intermittency is described in terms of fluctuations in the turbulence strength formula_47. It can be seen that the equation for the Gaussian random case above is just the special case from this equation with:
formula_48
where formula_49 is the Dirac delta function.

=== The profile ===
A more thorough description of the astronomical seeing at an observatory is given by producing a profile of the turbulence strength as a function of altitude, called a formula_47 profile. formula_47 profiles are generally performed when deciding on the type of adaptive optics system which will be needed at a particular telescope, or in deciding whether or not a particular location would be a good site for setting up a new astronomical observatory. Typically, several methods are used simultaneously for measuring the formula_47 profile and then compared. Some of the most common methods include:
# SCIDAR (imaging the &quot;shadow patterns&quot; in the scintillation of starlight)
# LOLAS (a small-aperture variant of SCIDAR designed for low-altitude profiling)
# SLODAR
# MASS
# MooSci (11-channel lunar scintillometer for ground level profiling)
# RADAR mapping of turbulence
# Balloon-borne thermometers to measure how quickly the air temperature is fluctuating with time due to turbulence
# V2 Precision Data Collection Hub (PDCH) with differential temperature sensors use to measure atmospheric turbulence

There are also mathematical functions describing the formula_47 profile. Some are empirical fits from measured data and others attempt to incorporate elements of theory. One common model for continental land masses is known as Hufnagel-Valley after two workers in this subject.

== Mitigation ==
The first answer to this problem was speckle imaging, which allowed bright objects with simple morphology to be observed with diffraction-limited angular resolution. Later came space telescopes, such as NASA&#x27;s Hubble Space Telescope, working outside the atmosphere and thus not having any seeing problems and allowing observations of faint targets for the first time (although with poorer resolution than speckle observations of bright sources from ground-based telescopes because of Hubble&#x27;s smaller telescope diameter). The highest resolution visible and infrared images currently come from imaging optical interferometers such as the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer or Cambridge Optical Aperture Synthesis Telescope, but those can only be used on very bright stars.

Starting in the 1990s, many telescopes have developed adaptive optics systems that partially solve the seeing problem. The best systems so far built, such as SPHERE on the ESO VLT and GPI on the Gemini telescope, achieve a Strehl ratio of 90% at a wavelength of 2.2 micrometers, but only within a very small region of the sky at a time.
 A wider field of view can be obtained by using multiple deformable mirrors conjugated to several atmospheric heights and measuring the vertical structure of the turbulence, in a technique known as Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics.
Another cheaper technique, lucky imaging, has had good results on smaller telescopes. This idea dates back to pre-war naked-eye observations of moments of good seeing, which were followed by observations of the planets on cine film after World War II. The technique relies on the fact that every so often the effects of the atmosphere will be negligible, and hence by recording large numbers of images in real-time, a &#x27;lucky&#x27; excellent image can be picked out. This happens more often when the number of r0-size patches over the telescope pupil is not too large, and the technique consequently breaks down for very large telescopes. It can nonetheless outperform adaptive optics in some cases and is accessible to amateurs. It does require very much longer observation times than adaptive optics for imaging faint targets, and is limited in its maximum resolution.
