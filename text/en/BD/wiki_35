<text>The House of Hesse is a European dynasty, directly descended from the House of Brabant. They ruled the region of Hesse, one branch as prince-electors until 1866, and another branch as grand dukes until 1918.

==History==
The origins of the House of Hesse begin with the marriage in 1241 of Sophie of Thuringia (daughter of Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, and Elizabeth of Hungary) with Henry II, Duke of Brabant, from the House of Reginar. Sophie was the heiress of Hesse, which she passed on to her son, Henry, upon her retention of the territory following her partial victory in the War of the Thuringian Succession, in which she was one of the belligerents.

Originally the western part of the Landgraviate of Thuringia, in the mid 13th century, it was inherited by the younger son of Henry II, Duke of Brabant, and became a distinct political entity. From the late 16th century, it was generally divided into several branches, the most important of which were those of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) and Hesse-Darmstadt.

In the early 19th century, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was elevated to Elector of Hesse (1803), while the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt became the Grand Duke of Hesse (1806), later the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine. The Electorate of Hesse (Hesse-Kassel) was annexed by Prussia in 1866, while the Grand Duchy of Hesse (Hesse-Darmstadt) remained a sovereign realm until the end of the German monarchies in 1918.

Since 23 May 2013, the head of the house has been Donatus, Landgrave of Hesse. He descends from the Hesse-Kassel branch of the family, which has been the genealogically senior male line since the house&#x27;s major partition in 1567. He is married to Countess Floria-Franziska of Faber-Castell. They have three children together.

==Branches==
Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, died in 1567. Hesse was then divided between his four sons, thus four main branches arose: Hesse-Kassel, Hesse-Marburg, Hesse-Rheinfels and Hesse-Darmstadt.

**** Battenberg (1858, morganatic line. Mountbatten since 1917)

The Battenberg family are morganatic descendants in the male-line of the House of Hesse, issuing from the marriage of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine with Countess Julia Hauke who, along with her children and agnatic descendants, were made princes and princesses of Battenberg and Serene Highnesses. The Battenbergs who later settled in England changed that name to Mountbatten after World War I at the behest of George V, who substituted British peerages for their former German princely title. Those descended from the marriage of Alexander of Battenberg, Prince of Bulgaria, contracted with a commoner after the loss of his throne, were granted the title Count von Hartenau.

Hesse-Kassel and its junior lines were annexed by Prussia in 1866. Hesse-Darmstadt became the People&#x27;s State of Hesse when the monarchy was abolished in 1918. Hesse-Philippsthal died out in the male line in 1925, and Hesse-Darmstadt in 1968. The male-line heirs of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld continue to exist to the present day.

<doc id="260920" wikidata="Q3500024" url="?curid=260920" title="Strand Bookstore">
<text>The Strand Bookstore is an independent bookstore located at 828 Broadway, at the corner of East 12th Street in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, two blocks south of Union Square. In addition to the main location, there is another store on the Upper West Side on Columbus Ave between West 81st and 82nd Streets, as well as kiosks in Central Park and Times Square, and a curated shelf at Moynihan Train Hall. The company&#x27;s slogan is &quot;18 Miles Of Books,&quot; as featured on its stickers, T-shirts, and other merchandise. In 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called The Strand &quot;the undisputed king of the city’s independent bookstores.&quot;

== Description ==

The Strand is a family-owned business with more than 230 employees. Many notable New York City artists have worked at the store, including rock musicians of the 1970s: Patti Smith – who claimed not to have liked the experience because it &quot;wasn&#x27;t very friendly&quot; – and Tom Verlaine, who was fond of the discount book carts sitting outside the store. Other celebrity employees include Richard Hell, Neil Winokur, Adam Bellow, Sam Shepard, Mary Gaitskill, Burt Britton, Lucy Sante, Marvin Mondlin, Ken Schles, and Thomas Weatherly Jr.

The Strand has had a unionized workforce for over 35 years. On April 5, 2012, unionized workers at the store rejected a new contract; on June 15, 2012, workers ratified a new contract.

Besides the main store and Central Park kiosk, an additional location called the &quot;Strand Book Annex&quot; opened in the 1980s and was originally located on Front Street in the South Street Seaport complex. It moved in 1996 to Fulton and Gold Streets in the Financial District, but finally closed on September 22, 2008, due to rent increases. A branch in the Flatiron District opened in 2013, and a summer kiosk in Times Square opened in 2016. In 2020 The Strand&#x27;s planned opening of its Upper West Side location was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2005, the main store underwent a major renovation and expansion, with the addition of an elevator, air conditioning, and a re-organization of the floors to make browsing easier for shoppers. It also began to sell discounted new books and non-book merchandise.

The bookstore had 70,000 books in its early years, which increased by the mid-1960s to 500,000. By the 1990s it had 2.5 million books, which necessitated the renting of a warehouse in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. At that time, the oldest book for sale in the Strand was an edition of &quot;Magna Moralia&quot;, which was priced at $4,500. The most expensive book is a copy of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; at $38,000. While the store continues to boast the slogan, &quot;18 miles of books,&quot; it now houses over &quot;23 miles&quot; of books.

== History ==
Benjamin Bass was an emigrant from Lithuania who came to the United States when he was 17. He worked as a messenger, salesman and subway construction worker before he came across the used-book district on Fourth Avenue between Astor Place and Union Square. His first bookstore was the Pelican Book Shop on Eighth Street near Greene Street. However, the store was not a success, and Bass next opened the Strand – named after the street in London – in 1927 with $300 in his own savings and $300 he borrowed; early on, he slept on a cot in the store. The new store was able to survive the Depression by use of Bass&#x27;s extensive network of contacts. Furthermore, his landlord was the last of the city&#x27;s noted Stuyvesant family, which carried the store through its lean years when Bass could not pay his rent; Bass later paid back the debt, and agreed to a schedule of voluntary rent increases during rent controls which were instituted with World War II. After rent controls ended, the Stuyvesant interests doubled the rents on their other properties, but not on the Strand.

The Strand was then located on Fourth Avenue, which had at the time 48 bookstores, in what was known as &quot;Book Row&quot;, which was established as early as 1890. These started to disappear around the 1930s due to the Great Depression and again in the 1950s, due to rent increases.

Benjamin Bass died in 1978.

Bass&#x27;s son Fred – who started working in the store on weekends when he was 13 years old – took over the business in 1956 and the next year moved the store to the present location at the corner of East 12th Street and Broadway. The store expanded to the entire first floor of the building, and then first three floors in the 1970s. In 1996 Bass bought the building at East 12th Street and Broadway for $8.2 million, by which time the Strand was the largest used bookstore in the world. The store now occupies three and a half floors, with another one and half floors for offices.

Strand also has two kiosks, one in Times Square and one in Central Park, and has a pop-up location in the Artists &amp; Fleas market in Soho. They also participate in seasonal holiday markets in Union Square, Bryant Park, and Columbus Circle.

Bass&#x27;s daughter Nancy Bass Wyden, the current owner of the Strand, began helping in the store at age 6, sharpening pencils for staff. At 16, she began taking phone requests, working the cash register, and managing the store&#x27;s Central Park kiosks. After receiving her MBA from the University of Wisconsin and working briefly for Exxon, she returned to New York City to work for her father at The Strand. Wyden officially joined The Strand as a manager in 1986. She established the store&#x27;s Books by the Foot department, curating custom book collections and private libraries. She spearheaded major renovations and expansions of the store in 2005, and supervised the rollout of The Strand&#x27;s official bookish merchandise, including t-shirts and totes, which now account for over 15% of the business&#x27;s revenue.

Wyden become the co-owner of the store on her father&#x27;s retirement in November 2017. With her father&#x27;s death in January 2018, she is now the sole owner.

Wyden is married to United States Senator for Oregon, Ron Wyden, whom she met while on a trip to Portland to see Powell&#x27;s Books.

On December 22, 2021, Ben McFall, who had worked at the Strand since 1978, and was the longest-tenured bookseller there, died in his home as the result of a fall. McFall did not have an official position in the Strand&#x27;s management, but was the only employee who had personal control over an entire section of the store, in his case the fiction section, and the only one with a desk designated for his own use. Wyden referred to McFall as &quot;the heart of the Strand.&quot;

===Fight against landmarking===
In December 2018, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission held a hearing on the topic of designating The Strand as a city landmark. Owner Nancy Bass Wyden objected and campaigned heavily against the designation, citing regulatory barriers to proposed renovations and increased costs of running the business as obstacles to running her independent business; she also contrasted the treatment of her store to the reception of Amazon HQ2 in New York, saying &quot;I’m not asking for money or a tax rebate, just leave me alone.&quot; The commission voted to landmark the building on June 11, stating that it had &quot;lost very few buildings&quot; to mismanagement. The landmarking can be appealed to the New York City Council.

===2020 controversies===
In March 2020, the Strand laid off most of its employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, though in April it received a Paycheck Protection Program loan between $1 and $2 million intended to help maintain 212 jobs of which 188 had already been eliminated. Less than two dozen union jobs were restored. In July 2020, the Strand laid off 12 recently rehired employees.

On July 15, 2020, the Strand opened a new location on the Upper West Side, replacing Book Culture.

On October 23, 2020, Bass Wyden released a statement on Twitter saying the Strand was in danger of closing. This plea for help, issued on a Friday, drew enormous sales in the following days, with 25,000 online orders placed over the following weekend. However, it also drew criticism from those who had followed the ongoing labor issues at the store.

Bass Wyden also drew criticism for purchasing $115,000 in Amazon stock in April and May, and then $60,000 to $200,000 of the stock in June, after having previously characterized the company as a threat to the Strand&#x27;s survival.

== In popular culture ==
* The Strand has been featured in films such as &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;, &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot; and &quot;Remember Me&quot;, starring Robert Pattinson, who played a Strand employee.
*The store and owner Nancy Bass Wyden were featured in the 2020 documentary &quot;The Booksellers&quot;, chronicling the antique book trade.

<text>Tambaba is an official nudist beach in Brazil, located on the Atlantic coast south of João Pessoa and north of Recife, at . In Tambaba, one must be nude in the family area (the main part of the beach). Around the periphery of the beach, nudism is optional.

Tambaba is a short beach, about . Until recently, the final access road was unpaved. However, as part of the regional infrastructure development, the Ministro Abelardo Jurema highway (PB-008) has been completed and the route is paved from João Pessoa to Tambaba. The beach sits in the municipality of Pitambui in the state of Paraiba and is considered one of the best beaches in Brazil. While famous for its nudist beach, it also has a public beach without nudism.

The area benefits from proximity of the recently expanded BR-101 route from Recife to Joao Pessoa to Natal, as well as to the other beaches of Tabatinga, Praia Bella and Coquerinho. This route is considered of high importance to the economy of Paraíba which is expanding due to the increase in tourism to the areas in and around Tambaba and the wider region including Joao Pessoa.

Tambaba Country Club Resort, a 150 hectare country club, is closely linked to the beach of Tambaba.

<doc id="260928" wikidata="Q139337" url="?curid=260928" title="Knights of the Dinner Table">
<text>Knights of the Dinner Table (KoDT) is a comic book/strip created by Jolly R. Blackburn and published by Kenzer &amp; Company. It primarily focuses on a group of role playing gamers and their actions at the gaming table, which often result in unfortunate, but humorous consequences in the game. The name is a parody of King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table reinforced by the truism that roleplaying aficionados often end up sitting round their host&#x27;s dinner table as it is the only one large enough to accommodate the party (four to eight people typically).

==The comic==
The panels are written by Blackburn, and given that he had no formal art training, the characters are drawn in simple caricatures which are scanned onto a computer and are continuously reused. Many of the stories presented in &quot;KoDT&quot; are based on actual in-game experiences of the developers or readers, who are encouraged to submit story ideas. Part of the comic&#x27;s popularity stems from the reader&#x27;s ability to relate to the characters and their experiences.

KoDT has won the Origins Awards for &quot;Best Professional Game Magazine&quot; of 1998 and 1999. It also won the Origins Award &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Choice: Best Periodical of 2003&quot;. KoDT has also won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Game Accessory&quot; of 2009.

== Publication history ==
&quot;Shadis&quot; editor Jolly Blackburn decided to draw a simple comic strip of his own to put on the last page of &quot;Shadis&quot; #2 (March/April 1990) which he called &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot;, focusing on the comedic interactions of a role-playing game group. Blackburn published that initial &quot;Knights&quot; strip with the intention of just filling an otherwise blank page, but when he instead published more professional comic strips starting with &quot;Shadis&quot; #6, fans began an outcry that led to Blackburn bringing &quot;Knights&quot; back. Blackburn also published &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; as a comic book, with its first three issues published by his company Alderac Entertainment Group over the next year (1994-1995). Blackburn had other interests that were not shared by his partners, so he left Alderac in 1995 and took the rights to &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; with him, and &quot;Shadis&quot; #21 (December 1995) was his final issue. Blackburn formed his own company called KODT Enteractive Facktory, though which he intended to publish the monthly &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; comic book, and he was planning to continue the comic strip in &quot;Shadis&quot;. While setting up his new company, Blackburn got a call from the editor of &quot;Dragon&quot; to publish the &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; comic strip, which then first appeared in &quot;Dragon&quot; #226 (February, 1996). The run that lasted through issue #269 (March 2000), when it was replaced by an expanded &quot;Nodwick&quot; strip.

Blackburn was working on &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; #4 (1996) when he realized he did not want to do everything alone, and he was talking to David Kenzer and the staff at Kenzer &amp; Company who wanted him to work for their company. David Kenzer and others were visiting with Blackburn in November 1996 during a local convention, when Blackburn decided that Kenzer had both the business sense and integrity that he wanted in a partner. Beginning with &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; #5 (February 1997) the comic book was the work of the &quot;KoTD Development Team&quot; which was made up of Jolly Blackburn, David Kenzer, Brian Jelke and Steve Johansson.

==Characters==
===The Knights of the Dinner Table===
The main group of characters are the members of a gaming group known as &quot;The Knights of the Dinner Table&quot; in a fictionalized version of Muncie, Indiana. The players&#x27; best-known and most often-used characters are the HackMaster characters known as the &quot;Untouchable Trio (Plus One)&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;UT+1&quot;). They consist of:

====Boris Alphonzo &quot;B.A.&quot; Felton====
B.A. is the GM and current organizer of the Knights (although the group was founded, and GMed, by Brian). In his 30s, he lives with his mother due to a failed attempt at game design, and works at the local pizza shop known as the Pizza-A-Go-Go, as well as his father&#x27;s dry cleaning shop. B.A. has a bad reputation among the Knights for being ruthlessly cunning, largely because the players tend to be paranoid and to react poorly to setbacks, and any attempt at normal gameplay usually ends in misery (or complete and utter disaster). He often finds his games thwarted or sabotaged by the antics of the other players, much to his dismay.

He is also a sucker for the local game-shop owner, &quot;Weird Pete&quot; Ashton (see &quot;The Black Hands Gaming Society&quot;, below), who constantly finds ways to sell him new or over-stocked product, on the basis that it&#x27;s just what B.A. needs to spice up his campaigns. B.A. was supposedly based on Jolly Blackburn himself. B.A. from late 2005 to early 2006 took a furlough from GMing, having seen too many of his hard-worked campaigns reduced to rubble, the last such disaster prior to his furlough being a difficult situation revolving around two self-aware swords. His place behind the GM screen was temporarily taken by Brian VanHoose. B.A.&#x27;s return to the gamemaster&#x27;s seat was heralded by his acquisition of a copy of the infamously deadly &quot;Temple of Horrendous Doom&quot; HackMaster scenario created by &quot;Weird Pete&quot;. Now he&#x27;s taken up a more hardball approach in the hopes of reining in the power gaming that wrecked most of his previous adventures.

====Robert Samuel &quot;Bob&quot; Herzog====
Bob lives for gaming. He&#x27;s a member of the &quot;Old School&quot; style of playing which revolves around killing people and breaking things. His short temper has led him into trouble on many occasions. He reacts to most encounters with &quot;I waste him/her/it with my crossbow!&quot;. Bob is extremely protective of his large dice collection. At one point, Bob came into conflict with his father over gaming, given the option to straighten up and give up gaming, or move out. Being the true gamer, Bob did indeed move out, and is currently attempting to live on his own, but tends to spend his rent money on gaming paraphernalia. Bob&#x27;s favourite character in fantasy campaigns is a dwarf named Knuckles (ranging from Knuckles, King of the Wall-climbers to Knuckles the Eighth), who rides a mule named &quot;Little Mike&quot; which he believes to be a &quot;Dwarven Warhorse.&quot;

Bob is in a relationship with Sheila Horowitz, a member of another Muncie gaming group, the Dorm Troopers; recent issues have shown the two apparently living together. Bob currently works for Weird Pete at the till, getting paid in gaming stock each week, because Weird Pete cannot afford to pay him in actual money. Bob has little qualms with this arrangement, and has even made Sara compliment him on how enthusiastic he is.

====David &quot;Dave&quot; Harcord Bozwell====
The youngest of the Knights, Dave is a student at Ball State University, where he studies Cultural Anthropology and Dance Theory (the latter of the two for the purpose of meeting girls). He originally used to show up for the food, but really got into the game despite a bad first encounter with Johnny (a former Knight who gouged Dave out of a priceless gem). Dave is the typical &quot;Hack-N-Slash&quot; player, who becomes bored easily in non-action situations. When faced with talking things through (at which he is poor), or fighting, Dave chooses the latter. Dave, until recently, played a character by the name of El Ravager, wielding a coveted Hackmaster +12 sword named &quot;Tremble&quot;. He lusts to own a god-level Magic Sword, but dreads the possibility of such a blade having its own ideas of what it is to be used for.

More recently (late 2006) in B.A.&#x27;s newest campaign, Dave has changed tactics (in part thanks to B.A.&#x27;s new hardball rules) and is playing a magic-user named El Mardico with, it must be said, some margin of success. Brian has therefore provided Dave with tutelage on how to properly run a mage – for a small fee. Dave was once involved with local Game Master Patty Gauzweiller; he later broke it off but she still had feelings for him, leaving him a target for her flirtatious tactics. This, however, seems to have disappeared with time.

====Sara Ashlyn Felton====
B.A.&#x27;s cousin Sara, the only female member of the group, prefers games with a focus on role playing rather than the pure action. Often, she tries to solve issues in-game through negotiation, while the others prefer violence. Exactly how she, playing a &#x27;good&#x27; character, came to unleash upon the game-world a blood-thirsty pack of pit bulls to attack and devour anything alive they come across (and quite a few not-alive things as well) is an &quot;entirely&quot; different story, and one Sara would like the world to forget about (even if she never will). Usually the voice of reason, Sara has reflexes that would scare a striking cobra and has been known to have a hair-trigger temper on certain subjects (sexist remarks being perhaps the foremost); Bob, Dave and Brian have all had their shirt collars wrenched by a fuming Sara at least once.

Unlike the guys who all have their favorite characters, whose descendants they want to return to, Sara has played different characters, including barbarians like Zayre and Thorina and clerics like Justinia. She also has the distinction of being the person that broke Brian&#x27;s undefeated streak at Risque (a parody of Risk). Brian is not fond of being reminded of this. Sara was supposedly based on Jolly Blackburn&#x27;s wife, Barbara Blackburn.

====Brian Montgomery VanHoose====
Brian is the rules lawyer and powergamer of the group. A web designer and miniature painter, he lives alone in a house inherited from his parents. He can quote rules and supplements down to page and paragraph/footnote numbers, and bend and abuse this knowledge to his advantage, at times at the expense of other players. He meticulously hands down notes of earlier adventures to his characters&#x27; descendants, thereby giving them in-game access to knowledge they otherwise would not possess, and has been known to tattoo his character&#x27;s spells on fellow party-members backs as a contingency plan, making them into walking grimoires. Brian is another person said to keep a grudge so long he has a regular account at the taxidermists&#x27; shop. In addition, when he does get pushed too far (either by a carefully constructed plot falling apart or a bout of in-game backstabbing), he has been known to flip the table in a moment of rage.

His weaknesses include a miserly streak that makes him charge other players 15 cents apiece for character sheets (and non-KoDT affiliated gamers 25 cents), and a love for dogs that can lead to B.A. leading him by the nose towards traps and misfortunes. Brian&#x27;s trademark characters are wizards, all bearing the name Lotus. His most well-known character is known as Teflon Billy, but this was a nickname given by the group to a character originally named Black Lotus (Black Lotus gives BL which gives Billy, and &quot;Teflon&quot; refers to the uncanny skill of the character at avoiding damage). Formerly a renowned Game-Master, he abandoned the GM&#x27;s Screen after an unspecified incident at a convention, but has recently taken it up again (after B.A. was burned out by repeated trashings of his best efforts in GMing), to run a complex &quot;Cattlepunk&quot; campaign. This campaign terminated with the sudden reversal of Brian&#x27;s meticulous plans, at the hands of an alliance between B.A. and Sara, and an unexpected role-reversal, (from cringing dupe to back-shooting plotter) on the part of Bob&#x27;s character; Brian threw the reins back to B.A., returning to the role of player, saying that he had only GM&#x27;d in order to keep his HMPA-GM credentials fully valid.

Brian has also appeared as a tragic character more than once; in his youth, his parents were killed in a car crash, and his uncle managed his inheritance until he turned eighteen. Living on his own, he concocts elaborate fantasies which he narrates to the other players about being taken globetrotting by his uncle for Christmas, or having a girlfriend (see &quot;Alexis Marie&quot; below), sometimes even making bogus phone calls or actually booking hotel rooms to strengthen the illusion. In one extreme case, Brian has been portrayed as role-playing a date with a doll, which he referred to as &quot;Sara&quot;; in another, when the Knights had met for pizza and were drawing from a prop Deck of Many Things that Brian made and imagining what would happen if the deck was real and affected their real lives, Brian drew the card &quot;the Void&quot; (&quot;Body functions, but soul is trapped elsewhere&quot;), and responded with &quot;That pretty much describes my life already.&quot; It has also been suggested Brian&#x27;s state may be linked to the fact that Brian previously ran six separate campaigns every week, and was paid for GMing, and further that there may be links between this and &quot;the incident&quot; which caused Brian to give up GMing. Recent issues have not mentioned this aspect of the plot, and it may have been dropped, as a number of reader&#x27;s letters suggested that readers found these developments too disturbing.
On a number of occasions (such as the doll incident mentioned above), Brian has displayed evidence of a severe crush on Sara; he has not, however, ever openly acknowledged this to her.

===The Black Hands Gaming Society===
Usually represented as the &quot;evil&quot; counterpart to the Knights, as most of their games revolve around the PCs finding reasons to kill each other before completing the intended adventure. Their membership consists of players who have been rejected from all other local groups, and hence they remain together simply because none of them has anywhere else to go. They are far more results-oriented than the Knights, enforcing demerit policies when Weird Pete is behind the GM screen (often worked off by unpaid labor behind Weird Pete&#x27;s counter), and holding extensive &quot;post-mortems&quot; on their game sessions, to see where things could have been done better (usually by the members of the group not slaughtering one another&#x27;s characters for minor infractions of local &quot;rules&quot;, to vent a real-life grudge, or to gain experience points needed to advance their own character a level or two). They are especially prone to do this to &quot;new&quot; characters—most all of them have a psychological &quot;button&quot; which triggers a desire to execute a character based solely on race, attitude or type of clothing (e.g. looking like the character &quot;might&quot; be an assassin).

* Victor &quot;Nitro&quot; Fergueson: Former Marine and the current GM of the Black Hands; he resorts to increasingly contrived methods to keep the group in order, including using demerits, using incentives, and forcing players to wear &quot;hubcaps of shame&quot; if warranted. Supposedly earned his name after an incident taking part in the steam tunnels under the local University where Nitro attempted to run a &quot;live action&quot; session. For some reason yet to be fathomed, Nitro has a habit of using deceased celebrities of cult-like status as NPCs in most, if not all, of his games (Andy Warhol, his apparent favorite, springs up everywhere—in HackMaster, Nitro placed him as the primary deity of his campaign setting, Kraag Wurld). Has little tolerance for stupidity and sucking up (usually done at the same time by Newt), and can quickly slip into a drill sergeant-esque tirade that would make R. Lee Ermey proud. Nitro was supposedly based on a real person who Jolly met at a gaming club, who really was nicknamed Nitro.
* Pete Ashton: Known to the gaming community as &quot;Weird Pete&quot;; owner of the local game shop, the &quot;Games Pit&quot; (originally called the &quot;Games Pit Stop&quot;). A player in the Black Hands, although he has occasionally acted as GM for both them and other groups in the comic, usually running his trademark &quot;never-completed&quot; adventure &quot;The Temple of Horrendous Doom&quot; (a reference of a pair of real D&amp;D modules, &quot;Tomb of Horrors&quot; and &quot;The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;) which &quot;no-one has ever completed without dying&quot;. In fact, the majority of the adventure requires players to take control of disembodied spirits; thus &quot;dying&quot; and being reborn is part and parcel of completing the adventure. Weird Pete generally forces players to sign a non-disclosure contract before playing as he enjoys the mystique that has evolved around the adventure. Weird Pete also devised a &quot;demerit&quot; system for penalizing players when he is GMing, which can be worked off with time running the front counter of the &quot;Games Pit&quot;.
: Weird Pete is a ruthless salesman and has no qualms about feeding his friends and customers a line of bull about the virtues of his wares; he has a particular talent for convincing B.A. that a given product or service is just what B.A. needs for his game. However, Pete is also a poor businessman, willing to shell out for whatever seems to be &quot;the next big thing&quot; and taking the fall when the product flops; he is often as vulnerable to the sales pitches of game manufacturers as his customers are to his own &quot;salesmanship&quot;.
* Newt Forager: A small and rather whiny and tricky player who invariably plays evil, mysterious loners with hidden agendas, all of whom are blood related so that he can share in-game information between them. The only child of a career military family, Newt bounced from base to base while he was young—perhaps the reason he has a hard time making friends. He has gravitated to the Black Hands because no other group will let him in (he played once with B.A. and the Knights when Bob was unable to game, and proceeded to try and rob everybody just to load up on treasure and experience for another GM&#x27;s game he was aiming for). Since joining the Black Hands he has acquired an ongoing hatred of Stevil, mostly due to in-game interpersonal warfare and vendettas. Newt&#x27;s first appearances with the Black Hands were initially believed to be examples of &quot;newbie-bashing&quot; (mistreatment of players who are new to a game or group, and are thus at a disadvantage) by several &quot;KODT&quot; readers; however, the creators behind the Knights point out that Newt&#x27;s anti-social and selfish tendencies both in and out of character put him on an even footing with the Black Hands from the start, and that sooner or later, Newt invariably gives as good as he gets where his fellow players are concerned.
* Gordo Sheckberry: A more roleplay focused player who usually plays female characters, most notably female pixie fairies who are dramatically underpowered compared to the other characters in the campaign. Gordo uses a wheelchair and has full lifetime disability, but considers this a bonus as it enables him to game almost daily with different groups. He is easily recognized by his Coke-bottle glasses and bad toupee. Gordo has a degree in chemical engineering, and is rumored to have cooked up the batch of C-4 used in an attempt to breach the steam tunnels (the incident that gave Nitro his nickname).
* Stevil Van Hostle: Also known as Stevil Van Hostile, Evil Stevil or Bitter Stevil, Stevil is a tech-support worker who commutes from Indianapolis to game sessions and is quick and vicious to jump on any grudge in the game (sometimes accompanied by his signature gripe, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I drove forty-five frickin&#x27; miles for THIS!&quot;). On occasions, he has been known to deliberately trash entire parties and campaigns simply because another player&#x27;s character won over on him. He has an ongoing grudge against Newt which started when Newt first joined the group; Stevil&#x27;s character challenged Newt&#x27;s to &quot;swing at him with a stick&quot; to test his combat prowess (after Newt refused to describe his character in game-statistic terms). Newt&#x27;s character knocked out Stevil&#x27;s with his first blow and it was discovered that Stevil had assumed that a &quot;stick&quot; would be a small twig or similar, whereas the &quot;stick&quot; Newt&#x27;s character had actually used was a full-length pole resembling a log. Outside the Black Hands&#x27; table, Newt merely brags he knocked Stevil out with an ordinary stick, which only serves to further annoy Stevil.

===Hard Eight Enterprises===
In the KODT world, Hard Eight Enterprises are the creators of the Hackmaster, Cattlepunk, Space Hack, and Scream of Kachooloo gaming systems. Well respected by all of Muncie&#x27;s gaming groups (USUALLY anyway), they call the shots. Hard Eight Enterprises run the tournament-level Hackmaster games in the semi-finals, which one year resulted in the disqualification of the Black Hands, and the Untouchable Trio (Plus One) causing Timmy Jackson to cry. Hard Eight runs the annual Garycon game convention; there is now a real-world convention with this name, held in memory of Gary Gygax in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

*Gary Jackson – President and founder of Hard Eight, Gary Jackson designed and created Hackmaster (a parody of Dungeons &amp; Dragons). His name combines those of Gary Gygax and Steve Jackson, two noted RPG designers. Gary Jackson has always been two things—first and foremost a gamer, but second and not distantly behind that at all: a business man. Some of Hard 8&#x27;s best and worst products were the design of Gary, including the One-Legged Dwarf Kits. Gary has a son by the name of Timmy (Timmy Jackson in full), who also is involved in the family business. However, Timmy is somewhat young, and a lot of the ideas he comes up with are met with spite and disgust. Gary Jackson allegedly died in issue #53 in a plane crash. Because of controversy surrounding the new edition of Hackmaster, Brian and Bob got into a vehicle and drove up to Hard Eight to confirm. Despite their shock and horror at his &quot;death,&quot; the two rubbed several of their dice on Gary (believed to endow good luck, they in fact cursed the dice). Suddenly, in issue #149, Gary emerged from hiding (after having faked his own death to avoid gambling debts), and started his own game company, purchasing several of his game lines from Hard Eight, now controlled by Heidi. Eventually, he merges his new company with Hard Eight, recombining their old intellectual properties, but must work under Heidi, who still owns it.
*Heidi Jackson – estranged wife of Gary Jackson and owner of a regular publishing company, Paperback Werks, and owner of Hard Eight since the (faked) death of Gary Jackson – although she rarely actually showed up at Hard Eight, instead holding telephone conferences with the staff. Heidi is a hard-nosed businesswoman who cares nothing for games or gamers, and imposed continuously harsher deadlines for Hard Eight to show greater and greater profit margins, having threatened to close down the company more than once if it fails to show sufficient growth. Many of the employees dislike Heidi, but Jo Jo (below) has accepted that her business attitude is only acknowledging and dealing with a weakness that was already there. Heidi began demanding changes in Hackmaster to the point it resembled one of the romance/adventure novels her company publishes. (Some changes suggested by Heidi appear to be not-so-subtle jabs at the then-recent, real-world alterations made to Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition.) After Heidi sold off several Hard Eight assets to have them purchased secretly by Gary, Gary found that his employees had signed Non-compete clause contracts with Heidi. Gary was able to &quot;charm&quot; Heidi into re-merging the companies.
*Timmy Jackson – Son of Gary and Heidi Jackson. Over the years, Timmy earned the nickname of &quot;Table Happy,&quot; because of his munchkin ways. He was also referred to on occasion as &quot;Timmy the Rules Mangler.&quot; Timmy was intended to one day inherit Hard Eight. Timmy used to participate in the creation of gaming systems, including Cattlepunk. However, Timmy was a munchkin (i.e. power gamer) and his products had poor reputations. Following the return of Gary Jackson, it has been implied that Timmy has lost interest in role-playing games and has grown into a typical teen jock, more interested in football and girls.
*Jo Jo Zeke – Jo Jo was (until his supposed demise) Gary Jackson&#x27;s best friend and he assumed daily management of Hard Eight after Gary&#x27;s &quot;death.&quot; Jo Jo was once forced to accompany Timmy Jackson to host a Hackmaster tournament because Gary was busy. In the aftermath, Jo Jo grabbed a then-crying Timmy and retreated back to Hard Eight as fast as possible. Everyone found out why very quickly, for the prize of the tournament turned out to be a $1500 certificate for One-Legged Dwarf Kits and Spelljacked cards. This development enraged even those who had lost the tournament, and a riot broke out. Jo Jo was pressed by the Hard Eight staff to stand up to Heidi Jackson&#x27;s more ridiculous changes to HackMaster. Jo Jo presented their case and was subsequently fired. He created his own gaming company, but was then brought back on board when Gary returned.

===Patty&#x27;s Perpetrators===
Patty&#x27;s Perpetrators (Patty&#x27;s Perps for short) are one of the newest sanctioned groups in Muncie recognized by the HMPA . Patty&#x27;s Perps have the stigma of being the very bottom of the barrel (i.e. they take in those who no one else will accept, like Crutch).

*Patty Gauzweiller – currently teaches a Kindergarten class in Muncie. She used to belong to the Black Hands before forming Patty&#x27;s Perpetrators (or more commonly &quot;Patty&#x27;s Perps&quot;). She often brings her &quot;teaching tools&quot; from her classroom to the gaming table (time outs, for example). Patty used to be in a relationship with Dave. They dated for a number of months before Dave decided to break up with her. In more recent times, after a series of misunderstandings and an eventual co-GM arrangement with B.A. during a massive PvP war at the Knights&#x27; table, surprisingly, Patty and B.A. appear to be on the road to an actual relationship.
*Leslie &quot;Crutch&quot; Humphries – Crutch is an ex-con who&#x27;s gotten two &quot;strikes&quot; and been put on notice. If he commits a crime again, he goes to prison for good. He&#x27;s often found at Hawg Wallers (though legally he is not allowed to be in bars by the terms of his probation, the police don&#x27;t usually go to Hawg&#x27;s). Despite his criminal record, it&#x27;s apparent to those who know him that he mostly has a good heart. He is a very loyal friend—though he often gets in trouble for his loyalty. Crutch discovered role-playing by accident, when he mistook a game of Cattlepunk the Black Hands were playing in Hawg Wallers for an actual meeting to plan a heist; when he was told the truth, he decided he would like to see how the heist turned out in the game anyway and was hooked on Cattlepunk. However, Crutch also had a social stigma of being cutthroat and was rejected from the Knights, as well as from the Black Hands. He finally found a home with Patty&#x27;s Perps, although he had to try hard to earn the acceptance and approval of the other players. He has learned much about fantasy role-playing and teamwork with fellow players in his time with the Perps, and in a recent Hackmaster Tournament/Grudge Match, Crutch was the only member of the group to advance to the finals. Moreover, it was his act of self-sacrifice that enabled Sara Felton (another finalist among the three teams that called the Grudge Match) to reach the final goal and win the game. Crutch eventually became an HMA certified gamemaster, drawing on his criminal background to run a surprisingly popular (and extremely lethal) &quot;Crime Nation&quot; campaign.
*Mona &quot;Mo&quot; Wert – Mona has a lot of time to game since her children are grown up and she received a large inheritance from a great-uncle, as well as her husband&#x27;s departure. She is proud of &quot;answering to no one&quot; and being a &quot;free spirit&quot;. She is honest, blunt, and rather ruthless, but most people still consider her enjoyable to be around. In her spare time she does volunteer work and met Patty working at her kindergarten.
*Eddie &quot;Tank&quot; Ramirez – Eddie acquired the nickname &quot;Tank&quot; in high school as the League Commissioner for his Fantasy Football League. He is very proud of his character – Kraven the Frost Giant thief. He believes he is the only player in the country playing a giant thief, although there are rumors that someone in Belize is playing a Hill Giant assassin. He has assumed the role of Crutch&#x27;s &quot;tutor&quot;, teaching him the intricacies of roleplaying and &quot;playing well with others&quot;. As a child, Eddie was extremely shy, and Patty&#x27;s Perps was the only group that accepted him. Patty has been working on &quot;coaxing him out of his shell&quot; and he started working out at Nitro&#x27;s gym regularly after she offered in-game incentives for exercising.
*Chad Aguilar – Chad is a graduate student as Ball State University, and working as a disc jockey to get needed money. He&#x27;s known for having a short temper – he is often sent to Patty&#x27;s time-out corner, and if he goes out prematurely, he&#x27;ll lose a level. When he started playing Hackmaster, his age (13) made it difficult to find an accepting group, but he was accepted in Patty&#x27;s group. He plays now with his love interest, Reese, who is a naive vegan peacenik completely unsuited for the brutal world of Hackmaster. After having a baby son (&quot;Peeta...&quot;) they ended up sharing a pixie fairy character with multiple personalities.

===Other groups===
The Dorm Troopers, Logan&#x27;s Heroes and Slacker&#x27;s Hackers are part of some of the other local gaming groups across whom the Knights come at intervals, most notably in the incident of the Player Exchange Program (and resulting intergroup grudge match). In this, certain Game Masters conspired to arrange for the annihilation of competing groups&#x27; characters (so that their bodies could be looted for plunder) by switching players into other groups&#x27; games where, separated from their regular comrades, they could be killed off. The ultimate plan was to eliminate competition in an upcoming local HackMaster tournament, as well as use any magic items and other enhancements looted from other characters to win the tourney.

===Other notable characters from the Muncie gaming community include===
*Bridgette Keating, a beautiful woman who wears skimpy costumes at conventions and delights in using her appearance to manipulate the &quot;geeks&quot; (not least by involving them in the LARP &quot;Vampyres: Lords of Darkness&quot; and then using them for manual labor).
*Earl Slackmozer, an occasional freelancer for Hard Eight Enterprises and a one-time rival of B.A. B.A. didn&#x27;t care for one of Earl&#x27;s modules and the two butted heads for a while, but have since learned to respect each other (more or less).
*Sheila Horowitz was introduced to gaming at the Knights&#x27; table (though never became an official member of the group) while dating Dave Bozwell, and once got in a fistfight with B.A. when he accused her of in-game cheating. She is currently a member of the Dorm Troopers, and is cohabitating with Bob Herzog. Sheila is arguably a vital part of Bob&#x27;s maintaining his independence from his father, as she initially took something of a &quot;mother hen&quot; attitude with Bob. Since moving in together, it is clear that Sheila is the dominant personality in the relationship, limiting Bob&#x27;s spending money and assigning him household chores (although, also, at the latest GaryCon, covertly arranging for Bob to fulfill his ambition to win a giant D20, even if she did then have to manipulate him into not displaying it on a table where she kept a family photograph). This relationship took a dramatic nosedive after Bob got suckered into a couple of Brian&#x27;s schemes to &#x27;get one over&#x27; on Hard 8, culminating in Bob losing Sheila&#x27;s trust over rent money spent on Hacker-Snacks.
*Hunter and Croix are Bob Herzog&#x27;s nephew and niece (respectively), whom he has introduced to gaming. Hunter was part of Nitro&#x27;s PeeWee team that competed in HackMaster tournaments, and later appeared in Wave 1 of Bob Herzog&#x27;s intercampaign invasion during the PvP war against Carvin&#x27; Marvin, Brian, and Sara.

Two fictional groups that are frequently referenced in stories are the Hackmaster Association for gamemasters (HMA) and Hackmaster Players&#x27; Association for players (HMPA). They act as networking organizations for the two types of participant, perform lobbying activities on behalf of their groups to Hard Eight Enterprises (e.g., to advocate for rule changes that benefit their members), arbitrate disputes, and issue rulings that are binding on their members. The HMA also serves as an accreditation body for gamemasters. The HMA and HMPA are examples of the exaggerated level of organization of the RPG hobby in the comic; another is the fictional Gamer Temps company that provides, for a fee, drop-in temporary players for campaigns when a regular player is absent (minor character Ty Ferfel was introduced as a Gamer Temps employee).

===Miscellaneous characters===
Characters who are not part of a gaming group.

*Squirrely – Weird Pete&#x27;s pet chimpanzee, he can be considered a security measure. Squirrely is actually a hyper-intelligent experimental animal formerly of a U.S. Government research facility; how he escaped is somewhat of a mystery, and one Weird Pete will likely never solve- mainly because he doesn&#x27;t know or even care. He works as sort of a gofer at the Games Pit, running errands on his scooter or sorting inventory. He has, on occasions, sat in at the Knights&#x27; table, substituting for one of the regulars (though never (so far) for Sara or Brian). He tends to do very well, because Weird Pete keeps his cage in the room he lets gamers hire for sessions, so Squirrely (who games as &quot;Squire Lee&quot;, a name Pete had also used to apply for a credit card) has seen most of the commercial modules played already, and knows where the treasure, monsters and traps are. Squirrely is also a rather heavy smoker—something that can create friction at the Knights&#x27; table, due to Brian&#x27;s bad reactions (either physically or psychosomatically allergic) to cigarette smoke.
*Erik Bouchard – A Canadian gamer who showed up at Gary Jackson&#x27;s funeral and rubbed dice on Gary, right in front of the entire Hard 8 Staff. He later appeared as a &quot;hired gun&quot; during the grudge match that resulted from the Player Exchange Program.

===In-game (non-player) characters===
The Knights themselves have encountered several recurring non-player characters in their (various) roleplaying campaigns. Among these are:

* (Li&#x27;l) Knobby Foot, the Untouchable Trio (Plus One)&#x27;s one-time loyal halfling torch-bearer, who fled with certain of the UT+1&#x27;s possessions, including Knuckles&#x27; &quot;dwarven warhorse&quot; and El Ravager&#x27;s &quot;magic cow,&quot; when the group was in dire straits and Knuckles, El Ravager, and Teflon Billy decided to use Knobby Foot as food. They also once shaved his head and branded &quot;slacker&quot; on his forehead for falling asleep on guard duty. He defected to Sergeant Barringer during the Bag Wars, and later inherited his position as lord of Barringer City. He eventually became a sort of lich and served a villainous role during a major campaign to destroy Bag World.
* Lord Gilead, formerly the henchman of one of Sara&#x27;s HackMaster characters who became a charismatic noble lord after an unknown, potentially dangerous magical helmet which the Knights insisted that he should be the one to try out turned out to be the legendary Helm of Lordship. He now rules the land of Faengerie and looks down on the propensity of Teflon Billy, Knuckles and El Ravager to burn and slaughter their way through whatever kingdom they happen to be in. Gilead is known to be a &quot;favored NPC&quot; by B.A., who uses him as to foil many of the players&#x27; more absurd large-scale plans and actions.
* Chelsie the Magic Cow, once owned by El Ravager and subsequently eaten by Li&#x27;l Knobby Foot. Originally she was an ordinary cow, grazing by the side of the road as mere flavor text. El Ravager insisted on investigating, and B.A.&#x27;s attempts dissuade them were met with more fervor and suspicion (&quot;there must be something really special about that cow if he&#x27;s trying to keep us away from it&quot;). When Teflon Billy used Detect Magic on the cow, B.A. sarcastically declared that it radiated a blinding magical aura. El Ravager laid claim to the cow, named her Chelsie, and over the course of several adventures sought to determine her supposed magic abilities; sadly, he never succeeded. Poor Chelsie met her end as a meal and warm clothing for Li&#x27;l Knobby Foot when he fled for his life from the Untouchable Trio. There is a similar story regarding Knuckles and a mule, though that was a case of deliberate trickery on the GM&#x27;s part; B.A. convinced Knuckles (Bob&#x27;s player) that &quot;Little Mike&quot; was actually a dwarven warhorse. Mike was also stolen by Knobby Foot, but was kept on as the former hireling&#x27;s steed when Knobby Foot joined the Barringer rebellion. (Oddly enough, when KenzerCo published the actual rulebooks for HackMaster, the dwarven warhorse showed up on the equipment lists of the Player&#x27;s Guide, along with a plethora of other items mentioned in the comic. However, it contains no references to magic cows, so Chelsie&#x27;s special abilities remain a mystery.)
* &quot;Red&quot; Gurdy Pickens, most often a bar-owner or piano player and nemesis of the Knights&#x27; Cattlepunk characters. From the players&#x27; perspective, the most feared of all of B.A.&#x27;s recurring NPCs; he is often recognized by description before being mentioned by name, eliciting a cry from the players (in unison) of &quot;RED GURDY PICKENS?!&quot;. A Canadian descendant of Red even showed up in B.A.&#x27;s Hacknoia campaign to plague the Knights&#x27; agent characters. He was Resurrected yet again as the sheriff (and primary antagonist for the players) of the town of Lazarus, during Brian&#x27;s Cattlepunk campaign. Red Gurdy Pickens appears as an NPC in &quot;Aces and Eights&quot;, the real-life analogue to Cattlepunk.
* Alexis Marie (aka &quot;Lexie&quot;), supposedly Brian&#x27;s girlfriend, but never seen by anyone else in the flesh. He talked about her larger-than-life adventures and careers for over two years before Bob and the other Knights decided the ruse was out of control; Brian had claimed they were engaged and even sent out wedding invitations. After a long, drawn-out intervention-type discussion, Brian was forced to admit that Alexis was not real. In a dramatic emotional outburst, he confessed he had created his own fantasy world, &quot;Brian&#x27;s Life&quot;, in order that he could feel loved (a sort of escape from the &#x27;harsh edges&#x27; of the real world). Alexis is now a touchy subject among all the Knights, and any mention of her at the table tends to result in Brian unleashing a furious beatdown on the person who mentioned her.
* Jonid Coincrawler, a gnomish thief and illusionist, who devises elaborate schemes to separate the Knights from their gold. In many cases, these schemes would not have worked as well as they did if it were not for the Knights simultaneously attempting an equally elaborate scheme to profit from a situation. In the &quot;reality&quot; of the comic strip, Jonid seems to be an established character from official HackMaster material rather than an original creation of B.A.&#x27;s, as he is mentioned in documents distributed by Hard Eight Enterprises.
* Sergeant Barringer, the leader of a group of hirelings that the UT+1 placed inside a magical bag of holding in order to transport them more easily (in other words, less expensively than buying them all horses). After Teflon Billy, who was in charge of the bag, forgot to feed the hirelings or let them out of the bag for several months, he was shocked to discover that, rather than dying, they had created a fortress and society within &quot;Bag World&quot;, living off the other resources that the Knights had stored there. This led to a conflict and eventually to several full-scale &quot;Bag Wars&quot; in which the Knights attempted to reclaim their items. In a more recent storyline, a campaign taking place generations after the end of the &quot;Bag Wars&quot; features the Knights&#x27; current characters entering Bag World and encountering societies descended from veterans of the wars; one of these settlements was &quot;Barringer City,&quot; ruled by a corrupted Knobby Foot.
* &quot;Carvin&#x27; Marvin&quot;, an intelligent artifact-level magic sword who is completely insane and delights in having his wielder kill and maim anyone nearby and/or themselves. On occasion, however, he can be persuaded to pursue a more useful goal, and on those occasions serves as a very powerful and effective weapon. The last time Marvin was wielded resulted in a clash between him and Tremble, the Hackmaster +12 that (played by Nitro) had asserted control over Dave&#x27;s character, with the result that &quot;every&quot; PC died and Marvin absorbed Tremble&#x27;s power as his own. He waited centuries at &#x27;Meatgrinder Rock,&#x27; luring in unsuspecting treasure hunters in and destroying them to create bodies for a mighty undead army. Eventually, the party returned to investigate the sword and Sara and Brian&#x27;s characters got too close and became dominated by Marvin, who then used them to launch a campaign to conquer Garweeze World. 
* Pit bulls. The UT+1 discovered that the HackMaster rules allowed pit bulls to be purchased in large quantities from even the smallest village, making them a cheap but effective weapon &quot;en masse&quot; (though somewhat uncontrollable, since the cheap price was for &quot;untrained&quot; dogs). Unfortunately, when one of Sara&#x27;s characters purchased a large group to run off guards transporting the other three player characters to justice, the dogs became feral and started gathering up every other pit bull in the country, one village at a time, until a vast pack of the dogs (&#x27;the Doomsday Pack&#x27;) was killing everyone and every living thing which they came across, changing the face of Garweeze World.

==Fictional games==
Since the comic centers around a community of role-playing gamers, the characters are seen playing many games that are analogues of real-world games (some of which were then published as real-world games). They include:

* &quot;Hackmaster&quot;, a fantasy role-playing game like &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but even more baroquely complex. &quot;Hackmaster&quot; games are typically set in &quot;Garweeze Wurld&quot;, a reference to Gary Gygax&#x27;s &quot;World of Greyhawk&quot; campaign setting. It is the game most often shown being played. Kenzer and Company has published multiple real-world versions of the game, including supplements with names taken from the comic (e.g. the &quot;Hacklopedia of Beasts&quot; guides to the monsters of Garweeze Wurld). In the very early &quot;Shadis&quot; scripts, the game the group plays is apparently called &quot;Dung &amp; Dragons&quot; (although this is only seen on the back of B.A.&#x27;s GM screen). &quot;HackMaster&quot; is initially described as a home-brewed rule set by B.A., but was later declared to be a published product.
* &quot;Spacehack&quot;, a science-fiction role-playing game like &quot;Traveller&quot;. Early strips implied this to be exactly the same game as &quot;HackMaster&quot; with different names, but it diverged later. One early storyline features the Knights&#x27; &quot;Spacehack&quot; characters traveling through a rift in space to Garweeze Wurld, where they encountered their &quot;Hackmaster&quot; characters. Several single-frame strips referring to &quot;SpaceHack&quot; were originally advertisement strips for the sci-fi RPG &quot;Fading Suns&quot; (which otherwise has no relationship to Hackmaster)
* &quot;Scream of Kachooloo&quot;, a horror role-playing game closely modeled on &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;.
* &quot;HackNoia&quot;, a modern-day espionage role-playing game like TSR&#x27;s &quot;Top Secret&quot;.
* &quot;Heroes and Zeroes&quot;, a superhero role-playing game like &quot;Champions&quot;.
* &quot;Cattlepunk&quot;, a Western role-playing game like TSR&#x27;s &quot;Boot Hill&quot;. The earliest strips call it &quot;Hackmaster: Cattlepunk&quot;, implying it may be a supplement or variation on that game. Kenzer and Company has published its own Western-themed game named &quot;Aces &amp; Eights: Shattered Frontier&quot;. 
* &quot;Crime Nation&quot;, a role-playing game where the characters are gang members in a crime-ridden city.
* &quot;Dawg: The RPG&quot;, a role-playing game, designed by B.A. Felton, where the characters are dogs of various breeds, similar to &quot;Bunnies &amp; Burrows&quot;, which featured rabbit characters. Was self-published by B.A. and was a disastrous failure; the one time the group played it, the session consisted almost entirely of making &quot;saving throws versus Canine Compulsion&quot; to avoid their character acting like an actual dog. Was later picked up by Hard Eight after an intellectual property dispute with Heidi and &quot;tidied up&quot; by Jo Jo Zeke.
* &quot;Vampyres: Lords of Darkness&quot;, a live-action role-playing game like White Wolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.
* &quot;World of Hackcraft&quot;, a massively multiplayer on-line role-playing game set in Garweeze Wurld, modeled on &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.
* &quot;Spelljacked&quot;, a fantasy-themed collectible card game like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Spellfire&quot;. &quot;Spelljacked&quot; is depicted as Hard Eight&#x27;s failed attempt to cash in on the CCG craze; they were later forced to practically give away their remaining stocks of cards.
* &quot;Fairy Meat&quot;, a miniatures game designed by Pete Ashton about cannibalistic fairies. Later published as a real-world game.
* &quot;Risque&quot;, a board game of world conquest modeled on &quot;Risk&quot;.
* &quot;Island of Kataan&quot;, a board game of building and trading modeled on &quot;The Settlers of Catan&quot;. When the Knights play it, most of them are baffled by its complete lack of rules for combat.
* &quot;TreasonHackers&quot;, a RPG that mimics &quot;Paranoia&quot;. It only shows up in the animated YouTube videos, and Brain thinks it&#x27;s a joke due to the high lethality rate.
* &quot;RoadHack&quot;, a post-apocalypse highway game of car-to-car combat &quot;a la&quot; &quot;The Road Warrior,&quot; clearly based on &quot;Car Wars&quot;.
* &quot;The Great War&quot;, an extremely detailed simulation of the First World War, costing several hundred dollars. A number of Muncie gamers formed the &quot;Guns of August Society&quot; to purchase and play it; over the years, all except Weird Pete and Brian have dropped out, and those two have been playing the game, at the rate of one turn per month, for fifteen years. When Johnny Kizinski briefly returned to the society, he found that Pete and Brian had stopped attacking each other and were continuing to play the game peacefully simply to keep it running: Johnny attacked, upsetting the balance. A reference to the &quot;monster games&quot; of wargaming&#x27;s past, such as SPI&#x27;s &quot;War in Europe&quot; or GDW&#x27;s Europa Series.
* &quot;Virulence: The Game of Biological Warfare&quot;, a boardgame with both cooperative and competitive elements, centered around keeping a patient alive as it is attacked by various diseases while engineering diseases to attack other teams&#x27; patients. Similarly themed to the cooperative board game &quot;Pandemic&quot;.

==Live readings==
An event held at the Origins Game Fair, and possibly other Gaming conventions, is the Knights Of The Dinner Table live reading. People in attendance will put their name into a random drawing. The &quot;winners&quot; go up on stage, sit around a table, and act out the comic book, with hilarious results.

== Affiliated products ==
Several games based on the comic have been published:
* The boardgame &quot;Orcs at the Gates&quot;, published in 1998, and an expansion &quot;Orcs: The Reckoning&quot; in 1999. The base game won the 1999 Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame.
* The card game &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table: HACK!&quot;, published in 2001.
* Four Lost Worlds gamebooks were published by Flying Buffalo based on the comic&#x27;s famous &quot;Untouchable Trio +1&quot; (Bob&#x27;s &quot;Knuckles&quot;, Dave&#x27;s &quot;El Ravager&quot;, Sara&#x27;s &quot;Thorina&quot;, and Brian&#x27;s &quot;Teflon Billy&quot;).
* HackMaster, a real-world realization of the game played in the comic, was published by Kenzer and Company. Based on the first edition of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (system used under license), it won the Origins Award for Game of the Year 2001.
* In 2000, a monthly spin-off comic was created, titled &quot;Knights of the Dinner Table Illustrated&quot;, AKA &quot;K.ILL.&quot; The comic depicts many of the adventures described within &quot;KotDT;&quot; however, K.ILL shows the player characters&#x27; actions rather than those of the players behind them.
*In 2018 a Kickstarted Live action show was produced. However, due to the mismanagement and misdoings of the Originator of the Kickstarter, Ken Whitman, now known as Whit Whitman, the 4TB harddrive with the footage was lost. Thankfully, a portion of the footage was recovered and Ben Dobyns of Zombie Orpheus Entertainment was able to make and send the backers a reconstructed version despite no obligation to do so.

<text>Reinhard Friedrich Michael Mey (born 21 December 1942) is a German &quot;Liedermacher&quot; (, a German-style singer-songwriter). In France he is known as &quot;Frédérik Mey&quot;.

By 2009, Mey had released 27 German albums, and generally releases a new album approximately every two years; his first album was &quot;Ich wollte wie Orpheus singen&quot; (1967); the most recent studio album is &quot;Das Haus an der Ampel&quot; (2020). His biggest success to date was &quot;Mein Achtel Lorbeerblatt&quot; (1972). His most famous song by far is &quot;Über den Wolken&quot; (1974), which numerous German artists have covered. Mey is known to embark upon an extensive concert tour every two or three years, with a live album released from each tour.

== Biography ==
Reinhard Mey was born on 21 December 1942, in Berlin, Germany, where he spent his childhood. At the age of 12, he had his first piano lesson, and at the age of 14 he got his first guitar. He taught himself how to play the trumpet. During his school years he gained performance experience by playing Skiffle music with friends. In 1965, Mey was offered the chance to perform at a Liedermacher festival at Waldeck Castle, a converted castle ruin. This led to his first recording contract. In 1961, he became part of the group Les Trois Affamés, with Schobert Schulz.

In 1963, Mey graduated from the French Gymnasium in Berlin, receiving the German Abitur as well as the French Baccalauréat, and thereafter began vocational training as an industrial trader at Schering AG Berlin. He broke off his university studies in economics to concentrate on songwriting and singing, and has been a successful performer in Germany, France, and in the Netherlands ever since. He has written songs in German, French, Dutch and English. He records his French material under the name of Frédérik Mey. In 1967, he married a French woman named Christine. Their marriage was dissolved in 1976.

Today, Mey lives in Berlin-Frohnau in his second marriage (since 1977) to Hella Hennies (born in Hanover), and had three children in the marriage: Frederik (born 20 November 1976), Maximilian (born 28 January 1982; died May 2014), and Victoria-Luise (born 19 November 1985).

His son Maximilian died in May 2014 after five years in a persistent vegetative state. Undiagnosed severe pneumonia had led to a cardio-pulmonary arrest, from which Maximilian was resuscitated after eight minutes of hypoxia.

==Lyrics and political views==
Mey writes both sensitive and humorous songs, with subject matter taken mostly from his everyday life and surroundings. His themes include life on the road, his hobbies (e.g., flying), childhood memories, his family life and surroundings, and occasionally politics.

Mey&#x27;s politics tend to be moderate to left-leaning. He speaks out in particular for freedom and non-violence, not only in his songs (for example, he participated in a demonstration at the beginning of 2003 against the coming war in Iraq). Nevertheless, his &quot;Annabelle&quot; criticises female political correct deadly-serious non-serene activism; Mey is later said to have repented of it and wrote another song in response to himself. Strongly influenced by the French chanson, Mey&#x27;s political songs were relatively scarce among his works at the beginning; however, they have increased in quantity over time, such that there is usually at least one song about politics on each new album. His 2004 album, &quot;Nanga Parbat&quot;, for example, includes &quot;Alles OK in Guantanamo Bay&quot;, a song critical of the U.S. detention facility in Cuba. The song &quot;Das Narrenschiff&quot; from his 1998 album &quot;Flaschenpost&quot; has enjoyed increasing popularity, likely due to its apocalyptic description of a seemingly more and more corrupt and insane world headed for disaster.

For years, Mey has been an avid vegetarian, and also has been active in the German chapter of the organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Several of his songs deal with the theme of prevention of cruelty to animals, the most famous one being &quot;Die Würde des Schweins ist unantastbar&quot; (roughly, &quot;a pig&#x27;s dignity is inviolable.&quot;, echoing the first sentence of the first article of the German constitution)

==Theme music==
The first bars of Reinhard Mey&#x27;s &quot;Gute Nacht, Freunde&quot; have been used since 1976 as the beginning of the theme tune for the popular Dutch radio show &quot;Met het Oog op Morgen&quot;, broadcast every night from 23:00 until midnight on Radio 1. After the words &quot;und ein letztes Glas im Steh&#x27;n&quot;, the Mey song fades away and an orchestra takes over.

<text>The North German Confederation () was initially a German military alliance established in August 1866 under the leadership of the Kingdom of Prussia, which was transformed in the subsequent year into a confederated state (a &quot;de facto&quot; federal state) that existed from July 1867 to December 1870. A milestone of the German Unification, it was the earliest continual legal predecessor of the modern German nation-state known today as the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Confederation came into existence following the Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 over the lordship of two duchies (Schleswig-Holstein) resulting in the Peace of Prague, where Prussia pressured Austria and its allies into accepting the dissolution of the existing German Confederation (an association of German states under the leadership of the Austrian Empire), thus paving the way for the Lesser German version of German unification in the form of a federal state in Northern Germany. The construction of such a state became a reality in August 1866, following the North German Confederation Treaty, initially as a military alliance only, while its first federal constitution establishing a constitutional monarchy with the Prussian king holding as the head of state the &#x27; was adopted on 1 July 1867. Laws could only be enabled with the consent of the&#x27; (a parliament based on universal male suffrage) and the Federal Council (, a representation of the states). During the initial three and a half years of the Confederation, a conservative-liberal cooperation undertook important steps to unify (Northern) Germany with regard to law and infrastructure. The designed political system and the political parties remained essentially the same also after 1870.

Shortly after its inception, tensions emerged between the North German Confederation and the Second French Empire, which was ruled by the French Emperor Napoleon III. In Summer 1870, a dispute over a new king for Spain escalated into the Franco-Prussian War. At the time, the original Confederation had nearly 30 million inhabitants of whom 80% lived in Prussia, thus making up roughly 75% of the population of the future German Empire. Under these circumstances, the South German states of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Württemberg and Bavaria previously opposed to the Confederation ultimately decided to join it. A new short-lived constitution subsequently entered into force on 1 January 1871 proclaiming in its preamble and article 11 the &quot;German Empire&quot; despite being titled as one of a new &quot;German Confederation&quot;, but it lasted only four months. Following the victory in the war with France, the German princes and senior military commanders proclaimed Wilhelm &quot;German Emperor&quot; in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Transition from the Confederation to the Empire was completed when the Constitution of the German Empire which prevailed until the demise of the monarchy entered into force on 4 May 1871, while France recognised the empire on 10 May 1871 in the Treaty of Frankfurt.

== Prelude ==
For most of 1815–1833, Austria and Prussia worked together and used the German Confederation as a tool to suppress liberal and national ambitions in the German population.

===&quot;Zollverein&quot;===
The first major step towards a Lesser German solution was the &quot;Zollverein&quot;, a customs union formed by the treaties of 1833, with Prussia being the primary driver behind the customs union. Although it was formally inaugurated on 1 January 1834, its origins may be traced to a variety of custom unions among the German states, formed beginning from 1818. The &quot;Zollverein&quot; was not subordinate to the Austrian-led German Confederation (1815–1866) and Austria itself was excluded because of its highly protectionist trade policy, the unwillingness to split its customs territory into the separate Austrian, Hungarian and Galician-Lodomerian ones, as well as due to opposition of Prince von Metternich to the idea. Nevertheless, the &quot;Zollverein&quot; managed to include by 1866 the majority of the German states.

===Frankfurt Parliament and the Erfurt Union===
In 1849, the National Assembly in Frankfurt elected the Prussian king as the Emperor of a Lesser Germany (a Germany without Austria). The king refused and tried to unite Germany with the Erfurt Union of 1849–1850. When the union parliament met in early 1850 to discuss the constitution, the participating states were mainly only those in Northern and Central Germany. Austria and the southern German states Württemberg and Bavaria forced Prussia to give up its union plans in late 1850.

In April and June 1866, Prussia proposed a Lesser Germany again. A corner stone of the proposal was the election of a German parliament based on universal male suffrage. The proposal explicitly mentioned the Frankfurt election law of 1849. Otto von Bismarck, the minister-president of Prussia, wanted to gain sympathy within the national and liberal movement of the time. Austria and its allies refused the proposal. In summer 1866 Austria and Prussia fought with their respective allies in the Austro-Prussian War.

=== Peace of Prague and dissolution of German Confederation===
Prussia and Austria signed a Nikolsburg preliminary (26 July) and a final peace treaty of Prague (23 August). Austria accepted the Prussian demand for the German Confederation to be dissolved. Prussia was allowed to create instead a &quot;closer federation&quot; () in Germany north of the river Main. Bismarck had already agreed on this limitation with the French emperor Napoleon III prior to the peace talks.

==Formation of the North German Confederation==
===Military alliance===
On 18 August 1866, Prussia and a larger number of North and Central German states signed the North German Confederation Treaty establishing a (alliance). The treaty created a military alliance for one year. It also affirmed that the states wanted to form a federal state based on the Prussian proposals of June 1866. They agreed to have a parliament elected to discuss a draft constitution. At the same time, the original East Prussian cradle of the Prussian statehood as well as the Prussian-held Polish- or Kashubian-speaking territories of Province of Posen and West Prussia were formally ′annexed into Germany. Saxony and Hesse-Darmstadt, former enemies in the war of 1866, had to agree their accession to the new federation in their respective peace treaties (Hesse-Darmstadt only joined with its northern province, Upper Hesse). Later in 1866, other states joined the treaty. The liberals in the Prussian parliament favored a wholesale annexation of all North German territories by Prussia. In a similar way, Sardinia–Piedmont had created the Kingdom of Italy. But Bismarck chose a different approach. Prussia incorporated (in October 1866) only the former military opponents Hannover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, the free city of Frankfurt, and the Hesse-Homburg area of Hesse Darmstadt. These areas were combined into the two new Prussian provinces of Hannover and Hesse-Nassau. Schleswig and Holstein also became a Prussian province.

=== Towards a federal constitution ===

Bismarck sought advice from conservative and democratic politicians and finally presented a draft constitution to the other state governments. At the same time, in late 1866, Prussia and the other states prepared the election of a North German parliament. This was elected in February 1867 based on state laws. The gathered from February to April. In close talks with Bismarck, it altered the draft constitution in some significant points. The was not a parliament but only an organ to discuss and accept the draft constitution. After that, the state parliaments (June 1867) ratified it so that on 1 July the constitution was enabled. In August, the first Reichstag of the new federal state was elected.

A major factor in determining the form the new federal government would take was the aftermath of the recently concluded American Civil War, which had seen the southern states forcibly re-incorporated into the United States of America and slavery abolished. While few Germans were particularly sympathetic toward the precise institution (i.e., slavery) which had precipitated civil war in America, the prevailing viewpoint outside the U.S. at this time was that the slaves had only been emancipated as a reprisal for Southern secession from the American Union. With this in mind, many Catholics especially in Southern Germany feared that Prussia might one day might attempt to engineer a similar sort of secession crisis within a united Germany and use it as a pretext to launch a violent repression against Catholicism throughout Germany. Thus, it was Bismarck&#x27;s intention to make the new federal state look like a confederation in the tradition of the German Confederation and explains the name of the country and several provisions in the draft constitution — Bismarck needed to make the federal state more attractive (or at least less repulsive) to southern German states which might later join.

== Constructing the nation-state ==
During the roughly three and a half years of the North German Confederation its major action existed in legislation unifying Northern Germany. The Reichstag decided on laws concerning, for example:
* free movement of citizens within the territory of the Confederation (1867)
* a common postal system (1867–1868)
* common passports (1867)
* equal rights for the different religious denominations (1869)
* unified measures and weights (with the obligatory introduction of the metric system)
* penal code (1870)

The North German Confederation also became a member of the , the German customs union of 1834.

=== Political system ===
The North German Constitution of 16 April 1867 created a national parliament with universal suffrage (for men above the age of 25), the . Another important organ was the , the &#x27;federal council&#x27; of the representatives of the state governments. To adopt a law, a majority in the Reichstag and in the Bundesrat was necessary. This gave the allied governments, meaning the states (and, depending on the state, their princes), an important veto.

Executive power was vested in a chancellor, being the only responsible federal minister of the country. There was no formal cabinet, and in the time of the North German Confederation there were only two government departments anyway: the as the general office of the chancellor, and, since early 1870, the foreign office.

The chancellor was installed and dismissed by the . This office belonged automatically to the Prussian king (art. 11). The holder was de facto the head of state of the North German Confederation. (Bismarck wanted to avoid the title with its republican air.)

For all intents and purposes, the Confederation was dominated by Prussia. It had four-fifths of the confederation&#x27;s territory and population – more than the other 21 members combined. The Prussian king was a kind of head of state. Chancellor Bismarck was also prime minister and foreign minister of Prussia. In that role he instructed the Prussian votes in the Bundesrat. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes in the Bundesrat despite being by far the largest state but could easily get a majority by making alliances with the smaller states.

===Customs union===
In June 1867 a conference took place between Prussia and the south German states, who were not members of the North German Confederation. After pressure from Prussia, new Customs Union () treaties were signed the following month. Henceforth, the governing bodies of the Customs Union were the Bundesrat and Reichstag of the North German Confederation, augmented by representatives of the south German governments in the former and members from these states elected in the same way as the others in the latter. When augmented thus for customs matters, the institutions were known as the Federal Customs Council and the Customs Parliament ().
On 1 January 1868, the new institutions came into force. Bismarck hoped that the might become the vehicle of German unification. But in the 1868 election the South Germans voted mainly for anti-Prussian parties.

On the other hand, the two Mecklenburg duchies and three Hanseatic cities were initially not members of the Customs Union. The Mecklenburgs and Lübeck joined soon after the North German Confederation was formed. Eventually, after heavy Prussian pressure, Hamburg acceded to the Customs Union in 1888. Bremen joined at the same time. Despite this, all these states fully participated in the federal institutions, even while outside the Customs Union and not directly affected by their decisions in that regard.

=== Postage stamps ===
One of the functions of the confederation was to handle mail and issue postage stamps.

===Transition to the German Empire===

In mid-1870, a diplomatic crisis concerning the Spanish throne led eventually to the Franco-Prussian War. During the war, in November 1870, the south German states of Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden (together with the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt that were left out of the Confederation) joined the North German Confederation. On this occasion, the country adopted a new constitution, and the name of the federal state was changed to (German Empire).

According to a minority among German experts, the North German Confederation and the southern states created a new federal state (the German Empire). Indeed, Bismarck allowed the south German states to save face and therefore used terminology suggesting a new creation. But Kotulla emphasizes that legally only accession of the southern states to the North German Confederation was possible; the legal basis for such an accession was art. 79 of the North German federal constitution.

On 10 December 1870 the Reichstag of the North German Confederation had adopted a new constitution, still titled as one of the (German Confederation) in spite of establishing for the state a new name (German Realm or German Empire) and granting the title of German Emperor to the King of Prussia holding the of the Confederation; it entered into force on 1 January 1871, but lasted only four months.

Following the victory in the war with France, the German princes and senior military commanders proclaimed Wilhelm &quot;German Emperor&quot; in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. This latter date was later customarily celebrated as the symbolic day of &#x27;foundation of the German Empire&#x27; (), although it had no constitutional meaning.

After a new Reichstag was elected on 3 March 1871, the transition from the Confederation to the Empire was completed when the permanent Constitution of the German Empire prevailing until the demise of the monarchy entered into force on 4 May 1871, while France recognised the empire on 10 May 1871 in the Treaty of Frankfurt.

The three constitutions (1867, January 1871, and April 1871) were nearly identical. It took roughly a decade to develop the country into a fully grown federal state, with several governmental departments (a kind of ministries), responsible state secretaries (a kind of ministers, 1878), and an imperial court (, 1879).

== List of member states ==

All of the member states had already belonged to the German Confederation of 1815–66. Austria and the south German states Bavaria, Württemberg, Baden and the Grand Duchy of Hesse (Hesse-Darmstadt) remained outside of the North German Confederation. Though, the northern province of the Grand Duchy of Hesse did join.

In northern, central and eastern Germany, Prussia:
* had gathered a number of allies that joined the North German Confederation via the August treaties () of August 1866;
* annexed four former enemy states (Hanover, Kurhessen, Nassau, Frankfurt) which became parts of Prussia (October 1866);
* included its own territories formerly outside of the Holy Roman Empire and the German Confederation, namely the East Prussian cradle of its statehood as well as the Prussian-conquered Polish territories (Province of Posen, West Prussia) in the new state, thus formally annexing them into Germany
* forced the remaining states into the North German Confederation via the peace treaties.

Lauenburg is sometimes mentioned as one of the member states, sometimes not. It was one of the three duchies that had earlier belong to Denmark. Lauenburg was a state with the Prussian king as duke until 1876, when it became a part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein.

<text>Misamis Occidental (; Subanen: &quot;Sindepan Mis&#x27;samis&quot;; ; ), officially the Province of Misamis Occidental, is a province located in the region of Northern Mindanao in the Philippines. Its capital is the city of Oroquieta while Ozamiz is the most-populous city. The province borders Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur to the west and is separated from Lanao del Norte by Panguil Bay to the south and Iligan Bay to the east. The province of Misamis was originally inhabited by Subanens who were an easy target by the sea pirates from Lanao.

The province is named after the early settlement of the Spaniards at the entrance to the Panguil Bay. The name &quot;Misamis&quot; is believed to have been derived from the Subanen word &quot;kuyamis&quot; which is a variety of coconut, the staple food of the early settlers. During the years the name persisted as an inference of the geographical location, and upon the advent of the Spanish settlers, the word &quot;kuyamis&quot; easily gave way to the more convenient pronounceable but corrupted word &quot;Misamis&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Misamis&quot; is derived from Subanen word &quot;kuyamis&quot; which is a variety of coconut.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
The area of now Misamis Occidental was first occupied by Subanen which was followed by Maranao and later Visayans settled in the coastal areas. During the 1750s was the time that the coastal villages in southern Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao suffered attacks from bands of Muslim pirates, who burned houses and crops, and captured people to be sold as slaves in Maguindanao, Sulu, Borneo or the islands now known as Indonesia. In response, the colonial government in Manila created a flotilla and appointed a Spanish Jesuit missionary, José Ducos, as its commander.

After several successful battles against the pirates, when some peace had been restored, it was decided to build a stone fort at the mouth of Panguil Bay, at a place called &quot;Misamis&quot;, and Ducos was put in charge of the construction. The construction began in 1756. It was officially called “Fuerte de la Concepción y del Triunfo”.
In 1818, Mindanao was organized into five politico-military districts, one of which was the &quot;Segundo Distrito de Misamis&quot;, the largest district in Mindanao. This area was composed of today&#x27;s Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental, Camiguin, Bukidnon, Lanao, Zamboanga del Norte, and the northern part of Cotabato.

In 1850, the town of Misamis became the capital of the district of Misamis until February 27, 1872, when the Spanish Governor General Carlos María de la Torre y Navacerrada issued a decree declaring Cagayan the permanent capital of Segundo Distrito de Misamis. During this era, the name of the town was &quot;Cagayan de Misamis&quot;.

===American colonial era===
On November 2, 1929, &quot;Legislative Act No. 3537&quot; passed, dividing the old province of Misamis into Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental, which took effect on January 1, 1930. Misamis Occidental comprised the original nine towns of Baliangao, Lopez Jaena, Tudela, Clarin, Plaridel, Oroquieta, Aloran, Jimenez, and Misamis. Don José Ozámiz y Fortich became the first governor.

On January 6, 1930, the provincial council of Misamis Occidental selected Oroquieta to become the capital town (&quot;cabecera&quot;) of the province.

In 1935, the Provincial Capitol Building, commonly called &quot;Capitolio&quot;, begun construction and became the seat of executive and legislative power of the province in the town of Oroquieta.

===Japanese occupation===
On May 6, 1942, the Japanese Imperial forces landed in Misamis Occidental, beginning their brief occupation of the province during World War II. In 1945, combined American and Philippine Commonwealth forces liberated the province, and with the help of the recognized guerilla units, defeated the Japanese forces. During World War II, Misamis became the capital of the Free Philippines as the seat of government of the Free Philippines then was the Capitolio. The United States Forces in the Philippines under Colonel Wendell Fertig based in Misamis Occidental, was the rallying point for the guerrillas in Mindanao. This was historically significant because it is the only time in Philippine history when its capital was in Mindanao, in the region then known as Misamis. The Free Philippine Government was then issuing Misamis Occidental emergency notes. Late President Manuel L. Quezon, upon knowing that Oroquieta was made a capital of the Free Philippines and that the town was issuing emergency notes, authorized the printing of the Mindanao emergency note.

===Philippine independence===
On July 16, 1948 — the town of Misamis became a chartered city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 321&quot;, making it the 4th city in Mindanao after Zamboanga, Davao, and Marawi. It was also renamed to &quot;Ozamiz&quot; after José Ozámiz y Fortich who at one time also served as its governor and congressional representative of the Lone District of Misamis Occidental, senator of the Philippines, and a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention that resulted in the creation of the 1935 Constitution for the Philippine Commonwealth Government.

On August 24, 1981 - Members of a fanatical pseudo-religious paramilitary sect called the &quot;Rock Christ&quot; strafed the house of the Gumapons, a family, in Barrio Lampasan, Tudela, Misamis Occidental. Ten of the twelve persons in the house, including an infant, were killed.

<text>Nicolas Chuquet (; born ; died ) was a French mathematician. He invented his own notation for algebraic concepts and exponentiation. He may have been the first mathematician to recognize zero and negative numbers as exponents.

In 1475, Jehan Adam recorded the words &quot;bymillion&quot; and &quot;trimillion&quot; (for 1012 and 1018) and it is believed that these words or similar ones were in general use at that time.

In 1484, Chuquet wrote an article &quot;Triparty en la science des nombres&quot;, which was unpublished in his lifetime. Most of it, however, was copied without attribution by Estienne de La Roche in his 1520 textbook, &quot;l&#x27;Arismetique.&quot; In the 1870s, scholar Aristide Marre discovered Chuquet&#x27;s manuscript and published it in 1880. The manuscript contained notes in de la Roche&#x27;s handwriting. His article shows a huge number divided into groups of six digits, and in a short passage he states that the groups can be called:
:&quot;million, the second mark byllion, the third mark tryllion, the fourth quadrillion, the fifth quyillion, the sixth sixlion, the seventh septyllion, the eighth ottyllion, the ninth nonyllion and so on with others as far as you wish to go.

In a second passage, he wrote:


:... Item lon doit savoir que ung million vault mille milliers de unitez, et ung byllion vault mille milliers de millions, et [ung] tryllion vault mille milliers de byllions, et ung quadrillion vault mille milliers de tryllions et ainsi des aultres : Et de ce en est pose ung exemple nombre divise et punctoye ainsi que devant est dit, tout lequel nombre monte 745324 tryllions 804300 byllions 700023 millions 654321. Exemple : 745324&#x27;8043000&#x27;700023&#x27;654321 ...

:Item: one should know that a million is worth a thousand thousand units, and a byllion is worth a thousand thousand millions, and tryillion is worth a thousand thousand byllions, and a quadrillion is worth a thousand thousand tryllions, and so on for the others. And an example of this follows, a number divided up and punctuated as previously described, the whole number being seven hundred forty-five thousand three hundred and twenty-four tryllions, 804300 byllions 700023 millions 654321 ...

In the extract from Chuquet&#x27;s manuscript, the transcription and translation provided here all contain an original mistake: one too many zeros in the 804300 portion of the fully written out example: 745324&#x27;8043000 &#x27;700023&#x27;654321 ...

Chuquet was, however, the original author of the earliest work using of a systematic, extended &quot;series&quot; of names ending in -illion or -yllion. The system in which the names million, billion, trillion, etc. refer to powers of one million is sometimes referred to as the Chuquet system.

In 1514, Budaeus introduced the term &quot;Milliard&quot; or &quot;Milliart&quot; for 1012, which was widely publicised around 1550 by the influential Jacques Peletier du Mans. Milliard was reduced to 109 around the end of the 17th century, leaving the modern Long scale system. This system is sometimes referred to as the Chuquet-Peletier system.

Much later, in France and in the US, a different system, the short scale, became established where the term billion signifies 109.

Last century, England and other English-speaking countries joined the US and some countries in using the short scale system; whereas, France rejoined Germany, much of Europe, and some other countries in the Chuquet-Peletier, or long scale, system.

<text>Lanao del Norte (Cebuano: &quot;Amihanang Lanao&quot;; ; Maranao: &quot;Pangotaraan Ranao&quot;), officially the Province of Lanao del Norte, is a province in the Philippines located in the Northern Mindanao region. Its capital is Tubod.

The province borders Lanao del Sur to the southeast, Zamboanga del Sur to the west, Illana Bay to the southwest, Iligan Bay to the north, Misamis Oriental to the northeast, and is separated from Misamis Occidental by Panguil Bay to the northwest. According to the 2020 census, the province has a total population of 722,902 people.

Situated within Lanao del Norte is the highly urbanized city of Iligan, which is governed independently from the province and also the largest city in both land area and population.

==History==

The province of Lanao existed from 1914 until 1959. In 1959, Republic Act No. 222 was passed by the Philippine Congress, partitioning Lanao into two provinces: Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur. The new province was inaugurated on July 4, with Iligan City as its capital. Back in the Spanish period, Iligan was founded by thousands of Visayan immigrants and garrisoned by a hundred Spanish soldiers.

The province then consisted of the municipalities of Baloi, Kauswagan, Bacolod, Maigo, Kolambugan, Tubod, Baroy, Lala, Kapatagan, Karomatan and the following municipal districts that got converted into regular municipalities of Matungao, Pantao Ragat, Munai, Tangcal, and Nunungan.

In 1977, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Resolution No. 805, s. 1977 of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (&quot;Parliamentary Bill No. 586&quot;) sponsored by Assemblyman Abdullah D. Dimaporo, into Presidential Decree 181 transferring the province&#x27;s capital from Iligan City to the municipality of Tubod.

In October 1984, inaugural ceremonies were held to celebrate the occasion of the transfer of the Provincial Capitol from Poblacion, Tubod to the Don Mariano Marcos Government Center (now Governor Arsenio A. Quibranza Provincial Government Center) at Pigcarangan, in Tubod.

Despite the outbreak of the conflict of the MILF led by Abdullah Commander Bravo Goldiano Macapaar bin Sabbar and the Philippine Army in Kauswagan in March 2000, through the provincial government&#x27;s effort, peace and order was restored in the province.

In 2018, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was passed into law; this law provided for the establishment of a new Bangsamoro autonomous region to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. According to this law, the six municipalities of Munai, Tagoloan, Pantar, Baloi, Tangcal, and Nunungan would be incorporated into this new region should a majority of voters in both the affected municipality and the parent province vote in favor of inclusion of the aforementioned municipalities in the proposed autonomous region in a plebiscite. The plebiscite was held the following year. A majority of voters in the affected municipalities voted in favor of inclusion in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region; however, the rest of Lanao del Norte voted strongly against, and as a result, none of the six municipalities were included in the new autonomous region after the provincial government campaigned against their inclusion.

==Geography==

Lanao del Norte is a rugged province that ranges from the coastal shorelines in the north to the high plateaus and mountains in the south. It has also diverse flora and fauna.

Lanao del Norte covers a total area of occupying the southwestern section of the Northern Mindanao region in Mindanao. When Iligan is included for geographical purposes, the province&#x27;s land area is . The province is bordered by Lanao del Sur to the southeast, Zamboanga del Sur to the west, Illana Bay to the southwest, Iligan Bay to the north, and Misamis Oriental to the northeast, and Panguil Bay to the northwest.

===Administrative divisions===
Lanao del Norte comprises 22 municipalities. The city of Iligan administers itself independently as a highly urbanized city.



==Demographics==


The population of Lanao del Norte in the 2020 census was 722,902 people, with a density of . When Iligan is included for geographical purposes, the province&#x27;s population is 1,019,013 people, with a density of .

The people in Lanao del Norte are a mixture of Maranaos and Cebuanos, with some Maguindanaons, Zamboangueños, Tausugs, Yakan, and Sama-Bajau. Historically, immigrants who came from the Christian provinces of Mindanao, Visayas and Luzon tended to settle in the northern part of Lanao while the Maranaos inhabited the south. There are also a minority of Higaonons settling in the hinterlands of Iligan. Kankanaey, an ethnic group from the Cordilleras in Luzon, can also be found as a minority in the province.

The Maranao had settled in the area long before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines. Like other groups, they possess their own culture which makes them quite unique. Their language, customs, traditions, religion, social system, costumes, music, and other features are factors that make Lanao peculiar and distinct from other Philippine provinces.

The main languages are Maranao, Cebuano, and Binukid, with the latter being the native language of majority of the citizens of the province. Aside from this, Filipino (Tagalog) and English are understood and spoken.

===Religion===

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) report in 2020, Roman Catholicism makeup for 47.3% of the population of Lanao del Norte while 45.5% are adherents of Islam. Other religions include other denominations of Christianity, Buddhism and other beliefs.
==Economy==

The economy in Lanao del Norte is predominantly based on agriculture and fishing. Factories are mostly based in Iligan City. Lanao del Norte is the home of Agus Power plants 4-7 that stretch from Balo-i to Iligan City. It serves major parts of power supply in Mindanao. Tourism is also a growing economy in the province.
==Politics and government==
Salvador T. Lluch was the first Governor of Lanao del Norte. Second was Mohammad Ali Dimaporo, who ruled from January 1960 to September 1965 when he ran and won the congressional seat of the province. By operation of the law of succession, Vice Governor Arsenio A. Quibranza became the third Provincial Chief Executive of the province. By the mandate of the inhabitants, Quibranza was elected governor in 1967 and almost unanimously re-elected in 1971 and again in 1980. When Martial Law was declared, Quibranza was arrested as ordered by President Marcos. While in prison, Vice Governor “Toto” Felix Z. Actub would succeed him as Governor

By virtue of the power and impact of the People Power Revolution on EDSA on February 25, 1986, local government all over the Philippines changed the political atmosphere overnight. Lanao del Norte became one among the many provinces affected by the sudden changes brought by the &quot;Snap Election&quot; in February 1986. Local heads of offices and employees particularly those holding political positions were removed but with the installation of President Corazon Aquino as president, OIC Atty. Francisco L. Abalos became the appointed governor of the province on March 3, 1986. On February 2, 1988, Abalos was elected as governor of the province.

In the synchronized National Election of May 11, 1992, Congressman Abdullah D. Dimaporo, a legislator, economist and son of Mohammad Ali Dimaporo, was elected Provincial Governor. The Provincial government embarked on a comprehensive planning and set the groundwork for the development of the province.

In the 1998 national and local elections, Imelda Quibranza-Dimaporo, wife of Governor Abdullah D. Dimaporo was elected as Provincial Governor until 2007, and from 2016 up to present.

The eldest son of former governor and now 2nd district representative Abdullah D. Dimaporo and Imelda Q. Dimaporo, Mohammad Khalid Q. Dimaporo entered the politics in the province from 2007 until 2016.

<doc id="260944" wikidata="Q2960292" url="?curid=260944" title="Charles Talbut Onions">
<text>Charles Talbut Onions (10 September 1873 – 8 January 1965) was an English grammarian and lexicographer and the fourth editor of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.
==Life==
C. T. Onions was born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, the eldest son of Ralph John Onions and Harriet, daughter of locksmith John Talbut. The Onions family were traditionally bellows-makers, but Ralph Onions was a designer and embosser in metal. Charles Onions said he was &quot;the first not to make (his) living by using (his) hands&quot;. The name &quot;Onions&quot; derives from the Welsh &quot;Einion&quot;.

Onions early came under the influence of A. J. Smith, the headmaster of the King Edward VI Camp Hill School, where Onions received his first contact with lexicography. He obtained a London BA in 1892 and an MA in 1895, both while attending Mason College (which later became the University of Birmingham).

James Murray invited Onions to join the staff of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (&quot;OED&quot;) at Oxford in 1895, and in 1914 he began independent editorial work with his own assistants. His &quot;Shakespeare Glossary&quot; was published in 1911; he co-edited &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s England: an account of the life and manners of his age&quot; (2 volumes; 1916) and, in 1933, he co-edited the OED Supplement with William Craigie. Following the death of William Little in 1922, he assumed the editorship of the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

Onions served as a fellow and librarian of Magdalen College, Oxford. He was president of the Philological Society from 1929 to 1933 and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1938. On completion of the &quot;OED&quot;, the universities of Oxford, Leeds, and Birmingham conferred honorary degrees upon him. Onions was appointed a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1934. In 1945 he succeeded R. W. Chambers as honorary director of the Early English Text Society and worked to extend its publishing program. He was editor of &quot;Medium Aevum&quot;, the journal of the Society for the Study of Medieval Languages and Literature, from its inception in 1932 to 1956. Onions&#x27; last twenty years were largely devoted to completing &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology&quot; (1966), which treated over 38,000 words and went to press just prior to his death.

==Personal life==
In 1907 he married Angela (1883–1941), daughter of Rev. Arthur Blythman, rector of Shenington, and they had seven sons and three daughters. Late in life, two of the children described their father as &quot;a strict and distant figure whose primary relationship was with the Dictionary rather than with them.&quot; During World War I, Onions served in British naval intelligence where his knowledge of German proved a significant asset. For much of his life, Onions had a stutter.

Anne Onions, one of his daughters, worked for many years in the Earth Sciences department at the University of Oxford as the departmental secretary and financial administrator.

== Archives ==
Onions&#x27; letters are held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.

<text>Henry Watson Fowler (10 March 1858 – 26 December 1933) was an English schoolmaster, lexicographer and commentator on the usage of the English language. He is notable for both &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; and his work on the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot;, and was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a lexicographical genius&quot;.

After an Oxford education, Fowler was a schoolmaster until his middle age and then worked in London as a freelance writer and journalist, but was not very successful. In partnership with his brother Francis, beginning in 1906, he began publishing seminal grammar, style and lexicography books. After his brother&#x27;s death in 1918, he completed the works on which they had collaborated and edited additional works.

==Biography==

===Youth and studies===
Fowler was born on 10 March 1858 in Tonbridge, Kent. His parents, the Rev. Robert Fowler and his wife Caroline, &quot;née&quot; Watson, were originally from Devon. Robert Fowler was a Cambridge graduate, clergyman and schoolmaster. At the time of Henry&#x27;s birth he was teaching mathematics at Tonbridge School, but the family soon moved to nearby Tunbridge Wells. Henry was the eldest child of eight, and his father&#x27;s early death in 1879 left him to assume a leading role in caring for his younger brothers and sister (Charles, Alexander, [Edward] Seymour, Edith, Arthur, Francis and [Herbert] Samuel).
Henry Fowler spent some time at a boarding school in Germany before enrolling at Rugby School in 1871. He concentrated on Latin and Greek, winning a school prize for his translation into Greek verse of part of Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s play &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. He also took part in drama and debating and in his final year served as head of his house, School House. He was greatly inspired by one of his classics teachers, Robert Whitelaw, with whom he kept up a correspondence later in life.

In 1877 Fowler began attending Balliol College, Oxford. He did not excel at Oxford as he had at Rugby, earning only second-class honours in both Moderations and Literae Humaniores. Although he participated little in Oxford sport, he did begin a practice that he was to continue for the rest of his life: a daily morning run followed by a swim in the nearest body of water. He left Oxford in 1881, but was not awarded a degree until 1886, because he failed to pass his Divinity examination.

===Teaching===

Trusting in the judgment of the Balliol College master that he had &quot;a natural aptitude for the profession of Schoolmaster&quot;, Fowler took up a temporary teaching position at Fettes College in Edinburgh. After spending two terms there, he moved south again to Yorkshire (present-day Cumbria) to begin a mastership at Sedbergh School in 1882. There he taught Latin, Greek and English, starting with the first form, but soon switching to the sixth form. He was a respected but uninspiring teacher, earning the nickname &quot;Joey Stinker&quot; owing to his propensity for tobacco smoking.

Several of the Fowler brothers were reunited at Sedbergh. Charles Fowler taught temporarily at the school during the illness of one of the house masters. Arthur Fowler had transferred from Rugby to Sedbergh for his last eighteen months at school and later became a master there. Samuel, the troublesome youngest brother, was sent to Sedbergh, probably to be taken care of by Henry and Arthur, but he stayed only a year before leaving the school, and of him nothing further is known. Henry Fowler made several lifelong friends at Sedbergh, who often accompanied him on holiday to the Alps. These included Ralph St John Ainslie, a music teacher and caricaturist; E. P. Lemarchand, whose sister eventually married Arthur Fowler; Bernard Tower, who went on to become headmaster at Lancing; and George Coulton, who was to write the first biography of Henry Fowler.

Despite being the son of a clergyman, Fowler had been an atheist for quite some time, though he rarely spoke of his beliefs in public. He had the chance of becoming a housemaster at Sedbergh on three occasions. The third offer was accompanied by a long discussion with the headmaster, Henry Hart, about the religious requirements for the post, which included preparing the boys for confirmation in the Church of England. This was against Fowler&#x27;s principles, and when it became clear that no compromise on this matter was possible, he resigned.

===London===

In the summer of 1899 Fowler moved to a house at 14 Paultons Square, Chelsea, London (where there is now a blue plaque in his honour), and sought work as a freelance writer and journalist, surviving on his meagre writer&#x27;s earnings and a small inheritance from his father. In his first published article, &quot;Books We Think We Have Read&quot; (1900), he first discusses the habit among Englishmen of pretending a familiarity with certain books—such as the works of Shakespeare or books considered &quot;juvenile&quot;—then proceeds to recommend that the savouring of these books should be &quot;no tossing off of ardent spirits, but the connoisseur&#x27;s deliberate rolling in the mouth of some old vintage&quot;. In &quot;Outdoor London&quot;, published a year later in the short-lived &quot;Anglo-Saxon Review&quot;, Fowler describes the sights and sounds of his new home, praising its plants, its Cockney inhabitants, and its magical night scenes.

===Writing partnership===
In 1903, he moved to the island of Guernsey, where he worked with his brother Francis George Fowler. Their first joint project was a translation of the works of Lucian of Samosata. The translation, described by &quot;The Times&quot; as of &quot;remarkable quality&quot;, was taken up by the Oxford University Press and published in four volumes in 1905. Their next work was &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot; (1906), a book meant to encourage writers to be stylistically simple and direct and not to misuse words. This book &quot;took the world by storm&quot;.

Fowler collected some of his journalistic articles into volumes and published them pseudonymously, including &quot;More Popular Fallacies&quot; (1904) by &quot;Quillet&quot;, and &quot;Si mihi —!&quot; (1907) by &quot;Egomet&quot;. In 1908, on his fiftieth birthday, he married Jessie Marian Wills (1862–1930). It was an exceptionally happy, but childless, marriage.

The Oxford University Press commissioned from the Fowler brothers a single-volume abridgement of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), which was published as the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary&quot; in 1911. The Concise Oxford has remained in print ever since, being regularly revised.

The next commission for the brothers was a much smaller, pocket-sized abridgement of the OED at the same time they were working on &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;; work on both began in 1911, with Henry Fowler concentrating on &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; and Francis on the pocket dictionary. Neither work was complete at the start of World War I.
In 1914, Fowler and his younger brother volunteered for service in the British army. To gain acceptance, the 56-year-old Henry lied about his age. Both he and Francis were invalided out of the army in 1916 and resumed work on &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;. In 1918, Francis died aged 47 of tuberculosis, contracted during service with the BEF. After his brother&#x27;s death, Henry Fowler and his wife moved to Hinton St George in Somerset, where he worked on the Pocket Oxford Dictionary and &quot;Modern English Usage&quot;, which he dedicated to his brother.

===Later years===
&quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot;, published in 1926, considered by many to be the definitive style guide to the English language, &quot;made the name of Fowler a household word in all English-speaking countries&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; described it as a &quot;fascinating, formidable book&quot;. Winston Churchill directed his officials to read it. The success of the book was such that the publishers had to reprint it three times in the first year of publication, and there were twelve further reprints before a second edition was finally commissioned in the 1960s.

On the death of its original editor in 1922, Fowler helped complete the first edition of the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, under the editorship of C.T. Onions.

In 1929 Fowler republished &quot;Si mihi—!&quot; under his own name as &quot;If Wishes were Horses&quot;, and another volume of old journalistic articles under the title &quot;Some Comparative Values.&quot;

On 26 December 1933, Fowler died at his home, &quot;Sunnyside&quot;, Hinton St George, England, aged 75.

==Legacy==
Currently, &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot; and &quot;Modern English Usage&quot; remain in print. The latter was updated by Sir Ernest Gowers for the second edition (1965) and largely rewritten by Robert Burchfield for the third (1996). A &quot;Pocket edition&quot; () edited by Robert Allen, based on Burchfield&#x27;s edition, is available online to subscribers of the Oxford Reference On-line Premium collection.

A biography of Fowler was published in 2001 called &quot;The Warden of English.&quot; The author was Jenny McMorris (1946–2002), archivist to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; at the Oxford University Press. &quot;The Times&quot; described the book as &quot;an acclaimed and meticulously researched biography&quot;. &quot;The Word Man&quot;, a play about Fowler&#x27;s life and career by the writer Chris Harrald, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Afternoon Play&quot; on 17 January 2008.

<doc id="260950" wikidata="Q3550262" url="?curid=260950" title="List of cities in the Philippines">
<text>This is a list of chartered cities in the Philippines. Philippine cities are classified into three groups: highly urbanized cities (), independent component cities (), and component cities ().

==Classes==
&quot;Highly urbanized cities&quot; are local government units autonomous from provinces that have a minimum population of 200,000 and an annual income of at least  50 million (in 1991 constant prices). &quot;Independent component cities&quot; are cities outside of provincial jurisdiction (although some are allowed to participate in the election of provincial officials) that have not yet attained the &#x27;highly urbanized&#x27; status, while &quot;component cities&quot; are those under a province&#x27;s jurisdiction. In addition, each city is classified into six income brackets according to income in a four-year period. For instance, 1st class cities have an income of  400 million or more, while 6th class cities earn less than  80 million in a four-year period.

Each city is governed by both the Local Government Code of 1991 and the city&#x27;s own municipal charter, under the laws of the Philippines.

==Map==

==List==
There are 149 cities of the Philippines as of July 8, 2023.

<text>Creswell Crags is an enclosed limestone gorge on the border between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, England, near the villages of Creswell and Whitwell. The cliffs in the ravine contain several caves that were occupied during the last ice age, between around 43,000 and 10,000 years ago. Its caves contain the northernmost cave art in Europe. The evidence of occupation found in the rich series of sediments that accumulated over many thousands of years is regarded as internationally unique in demonstrating how prehistoric people managed to live at the extreme northernmost limits of their territory during the Late Pleistocene period.

The caves contain occupation layers with evidence of flint tools from the Mousterian, proto-Solutrean, Creswellian and Maglemosian cultures. They were seasonally occupied by nomadic groups of people during the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. Evidence of Neolithic, Bronze Age, Roman and post-medieval activity has also been found there. There is evidence of Neanderthal occupation 50,000–60,000 years ago, a brief Gravettian occupation around 32,000 years ago and use of all the main caves during the Magdalenian around 14,000 years ago.

The site is open to the public and has a visitor centre with a small museum of objects associated with the caves, including a stuffed cave hyena. As a result of its unique features, Creswell Crags has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It has also been put forward as a potential World Heritage Site.

== Neanderthal and Upper Palaeolithic occupation ==
=== Creswell Crags and Whitwell Gap ===
Before Creswell village was built around the colliery in the late 19th century, there were only farms around the entrance to the Crags. The local Anglo Saxon villages were Whitwell, Elmton and Thorpe (Salvin). Creswell was the name of the farm nearest to the colliery site, and so a drop-off point for materials used in the building of the colliery. At that time Creswell Crags was known locally as Whitwell Crags. The Crags may be what was referred to by the Anglo Saxon poets who recorded King Alfred&#x27;s grandson, King Edmund, conquering the 5 boroughs from the Viking Earls in 942 AD, reaching as far as Dore and &quot;Hwitan Wylles Geat&quot; (the Whitwell Gap).

===Caves===

The most occupied caves were:
*Mother Grundy&#x27;s Parlour, which has produced numerous flint tools and split bones and was occupied until Mesolithic times.
*Robin Hood&#x27;s Cave, the location of a bone engraved with a horse&#x27;s head and evidence that its occupants hunted and trapped woolly rhinoceros and Arctic hare.
*The Pin Hole, the location of the Pinhole Cave Man, a human figure engraved on bone and discovered in the 1920s, and an ivory pin with etched lines.
*Church Hole, with more than 80 engravings on its walls and occupied intermittently until Roman times.

===Finds===

A bone engraved with a horse&#x27;s head and other worked bone items along with the remains of a variety of prehistoric animals have been found in excavations since 1876, including hyenas and hippopotami. The &quot;Ochre Horse&quot; was found on 29 June 1876 at the back of the western chamber in the Robin Hood Cave.

In 2003, the Ochre Horse was estimated to be between 11,000 and 13,000 years old.

===Cave art===
In April 2003, engravings and bas-reliefs were found on the walls and ceilings of some of the caves, an important find as it had previously been thought that no British cave art existed. The discoveries, made by Paul Bahn, Sergio Rippoll and Paul Pettitt, included an animal originally identified as an ibex but later confirmed as a stag. These, and subsequent finds included carvings on the ceiling of Church Hole Cave, have made Creswell a site of international importance. The finds are the most northerly yet discovered in Europe. Their subject matter includes representations of animals including bison and, arguably, several different bird species. Some workers, however, consider that the &quot;bird&quot; figures are more likely to be female anthropomorphs. The engravers seem to have made use of the naturally uneven cave surface in their carvings and it is likely that they relied on the early-morning sunlight entering the caves to illuminate the art.

Thin layers of calcium carbonate flowstone overlaying some of the engravings were dated using the uranium-series disequilibrium method, which showed the oldest of these flowstones to have formed at least 12,800 years ago. This provides a minimum age for the underlying engraving. The scientists and archaeologists concluded that it was most likely the engravings were contemporary with evidence for occupation at the site during the late glacial interstadial around 13,000–15,000 years ago. Most of the engravings are found in Church Hole Cave on the Nottinghamshire side of the gorge. Since this discovery, however, an engraved reindeer from a cave on the Gower Peninsula has yielded two minimum dates (through uranium-series dating) of 12,572 years BP and 14,505 years BP.

Not all of the figures identified as prehistoric art are in fact human made. An example given by archaeologists Paul Bahn and Paul Pettitt is the &#x27;horse-head&#x27;, Which they say is &quot;highly visible and resembles a heavily maned horse-head... lacks any trace of work: it is a combination of erosion, black stains for the head, and natural burrow cast reliefs for the mane.&quot; Others are a &#x27;bison-head&#x27; which they think may be natural and a &#x27;bear&#x27; image which &quot;lacks any evidence of human work.&quot; Notwithstanding they believe that more figures may be discovered in the future.

The site was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 documentaries &quot;Unearthing Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Drawings on the Wall&quot;, and featured in the 2005 BBC Two television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot;, as one of the wonders of the Midlands. In the &quot;Drawings on the Wall&quot; (Episode 1) Dr Paul Pettitt was interviewed about the so-called &#x27;naked ladies&#x27; engravings in Church Hole Cave.

==World Heritage Site nomination==
Creswell Crags first applied for World Heritage Site status in 1986, but was unsuccessful. Since then further research and development has been carried out and, in 2011, it was again put forward for consideration. In 2012 it was added to the United Kingdom&#x27;s &#x27;tentative list&#x27; – an essential prerequisite to formal nomination, evaluation and potential inscription as a World Heritage Site. The Tentative List identifies the universal outstanding value of Creswell Crags as being:
#The outstanding landscape of a narrow limestone gorge containing a complex of caves having long-intact palaeoenvironmental cave and gorge sediment sequences, containing rich cultural archaeological remains as well as diverse animal bone, plant macro- and micro-fossil assemblages
#In situ Palaeolithic rock art on the walls and ceilings of caves, dated directly to 13,000 years ago, providing direct cultural associations with Late Magdalenian human groups operating at extreme northern latitudes

In addition, Creswell Crags&#x27; significance has been enhanced by the discovery of a number of pieces of portable art made of engraved bone – the UK&#x27;s only known figurative Ice Age art – as well as assemblages of bone, stone and ivory tools.

<doc id="260952" wikidata="Q238789" url="?curid=260952" title="Belle Starr">
<text>Myra Maybelle Shirley Reed Starr (February 5, 1848 – February 3, 1889), better known as Belle Starr, was an American outlaw who gained national notoriety after her violent death.

She associated with the James–Younger Gang and other outlaws. She was convicted of horse theft in 1883. She was fatally shot in 1889 in a case that is still officially unsolved. Her story was popularized by Richard K. Fox — editor and publisher of the &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; — and she later became a popular character in television and films.

==Early life==
Belle Starr was born Myra Maybelle Shirley on her father&#x27;s farm near Carthage, Missouri, on February 5, 1848. Most of her family members called her May. Her father, John Shirley, prospered raising wheat, corn, hogs and horses, though he was considered to be the &quot;black sheep&quot; of a well-to-do Virginia family which had moved west to Indiana, where he married and divorced twice. Her mother, Elizabeth &quot;Eliza&quot; Hatfield Shirley, was John Shirley&#x27;s third wife and a distant relative to the Hatfields of the famous family feud. In the 1860s, Belle&#x27;s father sold the farm and moved the family to Carthage, where he bought a livery stable and blacksmith shop on the town square.

Myra Shirley received a classical education and learned piano, while graduating from Missouri&#x27;s Carthage Female Academy, a private institution that her father had helped to found. 

==Civil War and aftermath==
During the American Civil War, Myra&#x27;s older brother, John A. M. &quot;Bud&quot; Shirley, was an active Jasper County &quot;bushwhacker&quot;, fighting for the Confederacy. Myra was reputed to have supported her brother in these efforts, perhaps as a spy, although not much is known about the exact details. Bud was killed by federal troops in late June 1864. Soon after,&quot;sick at heart over Bud’s death and his business ruined by the theft and destruction, [John Shirley] disposed of his property, loaded his family and household goods into two Conestoga wagons, and set out for Texas ... Shirley’s destination was Scyene, a small settlement ten miles southeast of Dallas. Myra [May], a dutiful daughter, drove one of the wagons.&quot;According to the book &quot;Belle Starr&quot; by Burton Rascoe (Random House, 1941), the &quot;Shirleys were regarded as &#x27;rather common,&#x27; because they had no slaves.&quot; While in school, Myra was &quot;irregular in attendance&quot; and was regarded as &quot;rather wild&quot; by teacher Mrs. Poole.

Following the war, members of the Reed family also moved to Texas and, according to Collin County marriage records, James C. Reed and Mira [&quot;sic&quot;] M. Shirley were married there on November 1, 1866. Two years later, she gave birth to her first child, Rosie Lee (nicknamed Pearl). Belle always harbored a strong sense of style, which fed into her later legend. A crack shot, she used to ride sidesaddle while dressed in a black velvet riding habit and an ostrich feather-plumed hat, carrying two pistols, with cartridge belts across her hips. Reed turned to crime and was wanted for murder in Arkansas, which caused the family to move to California, where their second child, James Edwin (Eddie), was born in 1871.

Later returning to Texas, Reed was involved with several criminal gangs. While Reed initially tried his hand at farming, he would grow restless and associated with the Starr clan, a Cherokee family notorious for whiskey, cattle, and horse thievery in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), as well as the James and Younger gangs. In April 1874, despite a lack of any evidence, a warrant was issued for her arrest for a stagecoach robbery by her husband and others. Reed was killed in August of that year in Paris, Texas, where he had settled down with his family.

==Marriages and later years==
Belle was allegedly briefly married for three weeks to Charles Younger, uncle of Cole Younger in 1878, but this is not substantiated by any evidence. There are numerous claims that Belle&#x27;s daughter Pearl Reed was actually Pearl Younger, but in Cole Younger&#x27;s autobiography (quoted in Glen Shirley&#x27;s &quot;Belle Starr and her times&quot;), he discounted that as rubbish and stated what he knew truly of Belle.

In 1880, she married a Cherokee man named Sam Starr and settled with the Starr family in the Indian Territory. There, she learned ways of organizing, planning and fencing for the rustlers, horse thieves and bootleggers, as well as harboring them from the law. Belle&#x27;s illegal enterprises proved lucrative enough for her to employ bribery to free her colleagues from the law whenever they were caught.

In 1882, Belle and Sam were charged with horse theft. The arrest warrant was served by Deputy U.S. Marshal Lemuel Marks. The pair were tried before &quot;The Hanging Judge&quot; Isaac C. Parker in Fort Smith, Arkansas; the prosecutor was United States Attorney W. H. H. Clayton. She was found guilty and served nine months at the Detroit House of Corrections in Detroit, Michigan. Belle proved to be a model prisoner and, during her time in jail, she won the respect of the prison matron. In contrast, Sam was incorrigible and assigned to hard labor. In a contradictory account after her arrest by the Marshal, &quot;Belle proved to be a loud and unruly prisoner.&quot;

In 1886, she eluded conviction on another theft charge, but, on December 17, Sam Starr was involved in a gunfight with his cousin Law Officer Frank West. Both men were killed, and Belle&#x27;s life as an outlaw queen—and what had been the happiest relationship of her life—abruptly ended with her husband&#x27;s death.

By her marriage to Sam Starr, she was an aunt to Henry Starr.

For the last few years of her life, gossips and scandal sheets linked her to a series of men with colorful names, including Jack Spaniard, Jim French and Blue Duck, after which, she married a relative of Sam Starr, Jim July, who later became Jim July Starr, who was some 15 years younger than she was.

=== Children ===
Eddie Reed, Belle&#x27;s son, was convicted of horse theft and receiving stolen property in July 1889. Judge Parker sent him to prison in Columbus, Ohio. Belle&#x27;s daughter Rosie Reed, also known as Pearl Starr, became a prostitute to raise funds for Eddie&#x27;s release. She eventually obtained a presidential pardon in 1893. Eddie became a deputy in Fort Smith and killed two outlaw brothers named Crittenden in 1895, and was himself killed in a saloon in Claremore, Oklahoma, on December 14, 1896. Pearl operated several bordellos in Van Buren and Fort Smith, Arkansas, from the 1890s to World War I.

==Unsolved murder==
On February 3, 1889, two days before her 41st birthday, Belle was killed. She was riding home from a neighbor&#x27;s house when she was ambushed. After she fell off her horse, she was shot again to make sure she was dead. Her death resulted from shotgun wounds to the back and neck and in the shoulder and face. Legend says she was shot with her own double-barrel shotgun.

According to Frank &quot;Pistol Pete&quot; Eaton, her death was due to different circumstances. She had been attending a dance. Frank Eaton had been the last person to dance with Belle Starr when Edgar J. Watson, one of her sharecroppers and clearly intoxicated, had asked to dance with her. When Belle Starr declined, he later followed her. When she stopped to give her horse a drink at a creek on the way home, he shot and killed her. According to Frank Eaton, Watson was tried, convicted, and executed by hanging for the murder.

However, another story says that there were no witnesses and that no one ever was convicted of the murder. Suspects with apparent motive included her new husband and both of her children as well as Edgar Watson, because he was afraid she was going to turn him in to the authorities as an escaped murderer from Florida with a price on his head. Watson, who was killed in 1910, was tried for her murder, but was acquitted, and the ambush has entered Western lore as &quot;unsolved&quot;.

One source suggests her son, whom she had allegedly beaten for mistreating her beloved horse, may have been her killer.

==In popular culture==
Although she was an obscure figure outside Texas throughout most of her life, Belle&#x27;s story was picked up by the dime novel and &quot;National Police Gazette&quot; publisher Richard K. Fox, who made her name famous with his fictional novel &quot;Bella Starr, the Bandit Queen, or the Female Jesse James&quot;, published in 1889 (the year of her murder). This novel still is cited as a historical reference despite its artistic license and lack of historical accuracy. It was the first of many popular stories that used her name.

<doc id="260955" wikidata="Q57703" url="?curid=260955" title="Viktor Lutze">
<text>Viktor Lutze (28 December 1890 – 2 May 1943) was a German Nazi Party functionary and the commander of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;SA&quot;) who succeeded Ernst Röhm as &quot;Stabschef&quot; and &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;. After he died from injuries received in a car accident, Lutze was given an elaborate state funeral in Berlin on 7 May 1943.

==Early life==
Lutze was born in Bevergern, Westphalia, in 1890. He was employed by the &quot;Reichspost&quot; from 1907 until he joined the Prussian Army in 1912. He served with the 55th Infantry Regiment and then fought in the 369th Infantry Regiment and 15th Reserve Infantry Regiment during the First World War. He served as a platoon leader and a company commander and lost an eye in combat. After his discharge in 1919 with the rank of &quot;Oberleutnant&quot;, Lutze returned to his postal job and then became a salesman and a business manager. He also joined the &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund&quot;, the largest, most active and most influential anti-Semitic organisation in the Weimar Republic.

==Nazi Party and SA==
Lutze joined the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP; Nazi Party) in 1922, and the SA in 1923. He became an associate of Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, the first leader of the SA. Together, they determined the structure of the organisation.

He also worked with Albert Leo Schlageter in the resistance and the sabotage of the Belgian and French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923. He became the deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot; for the Ruhr in 1926. His organization of the Ruhr for the SA became a model for other regions. In 1930, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as a representative for Hannover-Braunschweig. In October 1931, he organized a huge joint rally in Braunschweig (Brunswick) of SA and SS men to show strength in strife-weary Germany and loyalty to their leader, Adolf Hitler. That was before Hitler came to national power as Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. Over 100,000 men attended the rally, hosted by SA-&quot;Gruppe Nord&quot; under the leadership of Lutze. At the rally, the SA assured Hitler of their loyalty, and he in turn increased the size of the SA with the creation of 24 new &quot;Standarten&quot; (regiment-sized formations). Hitler never forgot that show of loyalty by Lutze. A badge was made to commemorate the event. Lutze rose through the ranks and by 1933 was a SA-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot;. On 15 February 1933, he was appointed police president of the Prussian Province of Hanover and, on 25 March 1933, he became the &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of the provincial government and served until 28 March 1941. On 14 September 1933, came his appointment to the recently reconstituted Prussian State Council.

===Purge of Röhm===
Lutze played an important part in the Night of the Long Knives (June–July 1934). He informed Hitler about Ernst Röhm&#x27;s anti-régime activities. In preparation for the purge, both Heinrich Himmler and his deputy, Reinhard Heydrich, chief of the SS Security Service (SD), assembled dossiers of manufactured evidence to suggest that Röhm had planned to overthrow Hitler. Meanwhile, Göring, Himmler, Heydrich and Lutze, at Hitler&#x27;s direction, drew up lists of those who should be liquidated that started with seven top SA officials and including many more. The names of 85 victims are known, but estimates place the total number killed at up to 200 people.

After the purge, Lutze succeeded Röhm as &quot;Stabschef SA&quot;, but the SA no longer had as prominent a role as it had in the early days of the party. Lutze&#x27;s major tasks included overseeing a large reduction in the SA, a task that was welcomed by the SS and by the regular armed forces. On 30 June 1934, Hitler issued a twelve-point directive to Lutze to clean up and to reorganise the SA. On 20 July 1934, Lutze also was appointed to Röhm&#x27;s position as a &quot;Reichsleiter&quot;, the second-highest political rank in the Nazi Party. On 26 June 1935, he was made a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. He retained those positions until his death.
At the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg in September 1934, William L. Shirer observed Hitler speaking to the SA for the first time since the purge (Hitler had absolved the SA from the crimes committed by Röhm). Shirer also noted Lutze speaking there (Lutze reaffirmed the SA&#x27;s loyalty). Shirer described Lutze as possessing a shrill unpleasant voice, and thought that the &quot;SA boys received him coolly&quot;. Leni Riefenstahl&#x27;s film &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot;, however, shows the SA mobbing Lutze as he departs at the end of his evening-rally speech. His automobile can barely make it through the crowd. Alone among the speakers (apart from Hitler), Lutze receives the dramatic low-angle shots while he stands solo at the podium. Riefenstahl&#x27;s footage shows only Hitler, Himmler and Lutze in the march to the World War I cenotaph, where they lay a wreath. The makers of the film give the then little-known Lutze some of the prestige of a party leader to draw attention away from the former SA leader, Ernst Röhm, who had appeared often by the side of Hitler in the previous Riefenstahl film of the 1933 Party Congress, &quot;Der Sieg des Glaubens&quot;. After the Night of the Long Knives and Röhm&#x27;s murder, the film was withdrawn from circulation, and all prints were ordered destroyed, probably by Hitler; the film is known today only from a copy found in the Film Archive of the German Democratic Republic in the 1980s.

After the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, Lutze traveled to Austria to help reorganise the SA there.

In September 1938, &quot;SA Stabschef&quot; Lutze travelled to Passau to welcome Nazis who had returned from the &quot;Reichsparteitag&quot; in Nuremberg. Lutze stayed at &quot;Veste Oberhaus&quot; and seized the opportunity to meet Johann Nepomuk Kühberger, who had once helped to save Hitler from drowning in the Inn River. Now, he was a priest and played the organ at Passau Cathedral.

The reintroduction of military conscription in 1935 reduced the size of the SA significantly. Its most visible role after the purge was in assisting the SS in perpetrating the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in November 1938. In February 1939, Lutze reviewed a parade of 20,000 Blackshirts in Rome and then set off for a tour of Italy&#x27;s Libyan border with Tunisia.

==Death and funeral==

In January 1939, the role of the SA was officially mandated as a training school for the armed forces with the establishment of the SA &quot;Wehrmannschaften&quot; (SA Military Units). Then, in September 1939, with the start of World War II in Europe, the SA lost most of its remaining members to military service in the Wehrmacht (armed forces). Lutze maintained his position in the weakened SA until his death.

On 1 May 1943, his son Viktor was driving a car with Lutze and his entire family on the &quot;Reichsautobahn&quot; en route to Berlin. Near Michendorf, they were involved in an accident. The son was speeding, swerved to avoid pedestrians in the road, lost control, skidded and the car rolled over. Lutze was badly injured and his older daughter Inge was killed. Lutze died during an operation in a hospital in Potsdam the next evening. According to another version, Lutze died as a result of Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) ambush and the &quot;traffic accident&quot; narrative was used by German media to cover up the real cause of his death.

News reports stated that the accident involved another vehicle and kept the news of reckless driving from the public. Hitler ordered Joseph Goebbels to convey his condolences to Lutze&#x27;s wife, Paula, and son, Viktor. Goebbels, in his diaries, had described Lutze as a man of &quot;unlimited stupidity&quot; but upon his death decided that he was a decent fellow. At the time of the accident, Lutze was 52 years old.

Hitler ordered a lavish state funeral on 7 May 1943 to take place in the Reich Chancellery. Hitler attended in person, which he rarely did at that stage in the war, and posthumously awarded Lutze the highest award of the Nazi Party, the German Order, 1st Class. Thereafter, Hitler appointed Wilhelm Schepmann to succeed Lutze as &quot;Stabschef SA&quot;, but the organisation had by then been thoroughly marginalised.

<doc id="260958" wikidata="Q746819" url="?curid=260958" title="Castle Drogo">
<text>Castle Drogo is a country house and mixed-revivalist castle near Drewsteignton, Devon, England. Constructed between 1911 and 1930, it was the last castle to be built in England. The client was Julius Drewe, the hugely successful founder of the Home and Colonial Stores. Drewe chose the site in the belief that it formed part of the lands of his supposed medieval ancestor, Drogo de Teigne. The architect he chose to realise his dream was Edwin Lutyens, then at the height of his career. Lutyens lamented Drewe&#x27;s determination to have a castle but nevertheless produced one of his finest buildings. The architectural critic Christopher Hussey described the result: &quot;The ultimate justification of Drogo is that it does not pretend to be a castle. It is a castle, as a castle is built, of granite, on a mountain, in the twentieth century&quot;.

The castle was given to the National Trust in 1974, the first building constructed in the twentieth century that the Trust acquired. The castle is a Grade I listed building. The gardens are Grade II* listed on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==

In 1910 Julius Drewe bought about south and west of the village of Drewsteignton in the belief that he was descended from the Drewe family that once lived here. Born Drew, the son of George Smith Drew and his wife Mary, née Peek, both from substantial families of grocers, Drewe added the &quot;e&quot; to his surname later in life. At the age of 18, Drewe was sent to China as a tea-buyer by his uncle, Francis Peek (c.1836–99), a partner in Liverpool tea-merchants Peek and Winch. Julius&#x27;s great uncle, Richard Peek (1782–1867), one of the three brothers who founded Peek and Winch, was an abolitionist and philanthropist who was on the organising committee of the anti-slavery conventions held in London in 1840 and 1843. The Peek and Winch company later expanded into coffee, cocoa, rubber and spices, and owned plantations in the Dutch East Indies. In 1878, Drewe returned to Liverpool and opened the Willow Pattern Tea Store. In 1883, Drewe and John Musker (1846–1926) founded the Home and Colonial Trading Association (later Home and Colonial Stores), which sold teas selected in India by Drewe, alongside other groceries. By 1903, the company had 500 stores. By the time of his death in 1931 he had bought up an estate of 1,500 acres. Around 1910 he asked Edwin Lutyens to build him a castle. According to his son Basil, he did so on the advice of Edward Hudson, proprietor of &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine, who was both a patron and a champion of Lutyens. Drewe was now 54 years old, but he still had time, energy and money to create his new family seat. The budget was £50,000 for the castle, and a further £10,000 for the garden. Lutyens wrote privately of his concern over Drewe&#x27;s ambitions; &quot;I do wish he didn&#x27;t want a castle but just a delicious loveable house with plenty of good large rooms in it&quot;. On 4 April 1911, Drewe&#x27;s 55th birthday, the first foundation stone was laid.
===Construction===
The castle took many years to complete, with the First World War and the economic downturn causing many delays. One reason for the slow progress was the very limited number of craftsmen used. The writer Christopher Hussey records that &quot;after the first year, every stone was laid by two men alone...Devon masons Cleeve and Dewdney&quot;. As significant, was Drewe&#x27;s waning enthusiasm; his son and heir Adrian was killed on 12 July 1917, in early skirmishes prior to the Battle of Passchendaele. Drewe&#x27;s daughter later recalled, &quot;after my brother&#x27;s death...the joy of life went out as far as my father and mother were concerned...my father really was somewhat of an invalid afterwards. Overall responsibility for the construction work was held by Drewe&#x27;s agent, John Coates Walker, described in the most recent guide to the castle as &quot;the unsung hero of the whole venture&quot;. Castle Drogo was finally completed in 1930, roughly a third of the size of Lutyens&#x27;s 1911 designs, and only a year before Julius died; he had, however, been able to live in the house since around 1925. The catalogue prepared for the 1981 exhibition at the Hayward Gallery on Lutyens&#x27; work describes Drogo as &quot;one of his finest buildings&quot;. It was built at the same time as Lutyens&#x27;s work in New Delhi, resulting in many similarities in design.

===Later use===
After Julius&#x27;s death, his wife Frances and her son Basil continued to live at the castle. During 1939–45, Frances and her daughter Mary ran the house as a home for babies made homeless during the bombings of London. Frances Drewe died in 1954 and Basil was then joined at Drogo by his son Anthony and his wife. In 1974, Anthony and his son, Dr Christopher Drewe, gave Castle Drogo, Whiddon Farm, several cottages in Drewsteignton, a financial dowry and of the surrounding land to the National Trust. It was the first 20th-century property the charity acquired. The writer and National Trust administrator James Lees-Milne recorded his impressions of the house and its owners in a diary entry dated 9 September 1976; &quot;Reached Castle Drogo ... at eleven. Very satisfactory house of clean-cut granite. A new family aspiring to, rather arriving at, landed gentry-hood and now the representative living upstairs in a tiny flat, all within my lifetime&quot;.

The castle has been undergoing an extensive, five-year restoration. A new visitor centre with shop and café opened in the summer of 2009, after English Heritage required that industrial kitchen equipment such as that used by the previous café within the house, be removed from Grade I listed buildings. In February 2011, the National Trust launched a public appeal for money to fund necessary restoration work.

==Architecture and description==
Castle Drogo was the last castle to be built in England. As constructed, the castle represents approximately one third of the building Lutyens originally planned. The intended building would have run the entire length of the ridge, forming three sides of a large courtyard. The existing structure broadly represents the planned eastern wing of the whole. It was to have been matched by a corresponding wing to the west, the two joined by a northern block enclosing the planned great hall. Drewe balked at the costs, although his own decision to double the thickness of all of the walls on grounds of authenticity was a significant factor in their escalation. Pre-war, the plan for the western wing was abandoned, and after the end of hostilities, which had seen the death of Drewe&#x27;s eldest son, plans for the great hall were also set aside, with the undercroft, which had been constructed, becoming the crypt chapel.

The castle borrows styles of castle building from the medieval and Tudor periods, along with more minimalist contemporary approaches. A notable feature is the encasement of the service staircase, around which the main staircase climbs. Its defensive characteristics are purely decorative. Additionally, the castle had electricity and lifts from the outset, with power being supplied by two turbines on the river below. The castle is a Grade I listed building.

===Exterior===
The castle essentially comprises a three-storey main block, with a four-storey family and service wing to the side.

===Interior===
The main block comprises four reception rooms, the hall, the library, the dining room and the drawing room.

==Gardens==
The castle has a formal garden, designed by Lutyens with planting by George Dillistone, which contrasts with its setting on the edge of Dartmoor. In 1915, Lutyens brought in Gertrude Jekyll to assist with the planning. Jekyll&#x27;s involvement appears to have been limited to designing the planting for the approach to the castle along the drive. The garden is noted for its rhododendrons and magnolias, herbaceous borders, rose garden, shrub garden and circular grass tennis court now used for croquet. The gardens are Grade II* listed.

<text>A justice of the peace (JP) is a judicial officer of a lower court, elected or appointed by means of a commission (letters patent) to keep the peace. In past centuries the term commissioner of the peace was often used with the same meaning. Depending on the jurisdiction, such justices dispense summary justice or merely deal with local administrative applications in common law jurisdictions. Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve, and are (or were) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office. Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs.

==History==
In 1195, Richard I of England and his minister Hubert Walter commissioned certain knights to preserve the peace in unruly areas. They were responsible to the King in ensuring that the law was upheld and preserving the &quot;King&#x27;s peace&quot;. Therefore, they were known as &quot;keepers of the peace&quot;.

An act of 1327 had referred to &quot;good and lawful men&quot; to be appointed in every county in the land to &quot;guard the peace&quot;; such individuals were first referred to as conservators of the peace, or wardens of the peace. The title &quot;justice of the peace&quot; derives from 1361, in the reign of Edward III. The &quot;peace&quot; to be guarded is the sovereign&#x27;s, the maintenance of which is the duty of the Crown under the royal prerogative. Justices of the peace still use the power conferred or re-conferred on them since 1361 to bind over unruly persons &quot;to be of good behaviour&quot;. The bind over is not a punishment, but a preventive measure, intended to ensure that people thought likely to offend will not do so. The justices&#x27; alternative title of &quot;magistrate&quot; dates from the 16th century, although the word had been in use centuries earlier to describe some legal officials of Roman times.

In the centuries from the Tudor period until the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the JPs constituted a major element of the English (later British) governmental system, which in modern times has sometimes been termed a squirearchy (i.e., dominance of the land-owning gentry). For example, historian Tim Blanning notes that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the Bill of Rights 1689, in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary absolute monarchies such as France – a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the same social class as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground.

Being an unpaid office, undertaken voluntarily and sometimes more for the sake of renown or to confirm the justice&#x27;s standing within the community, the justice was typically a member of the gentry. The justices of the peace conducted arraignments in all criminal cases, and tried misdemeanours and infractions of local ordinances and bylaws. Towns and boroughs with enough burdensome judicial business that could not find volunteers for the unpaid role of justice of the peace had to petition the Crown for authority to hire a paid stipendiary magistrate.

The Municipal Corporations Act 1835 stripped the power to appoint normal JPs from those municipal corporations that had it. This was replaced by the present system, where the Lord Chancellor nominates candidates with local advice, for appointment by the Crown.

Until the introduction of elected county councils in the 19th century, JPs, in quarter sessions, also administered the county at a local level. Their many roles included regulating wages and food supplies, managing roads, bridges, prisons and workhouses and they undertook to provide and supervise locally those services mandated by the Crown and Parliament for the welfare of the county. To this end they set the County Rate, where one was set at all.

Women were not allowed to become JPs in the United Kingdom until 1919, the first woman being Ada Summers, the Mayor of Stalybridge, who was a JP by virtue of her office. In October 1920 Summers was appointed a JP in her own right, alongside other pioneers including Edith Sutton and Miriam Lightowler OBE in Halifax. Emily Murphy of Edmonton, Canada, preceded her by some three and a half years. As at 2018 in England and Wales, about one-third of JPs are women.

In special circumstances, a justice of the peace can be the highest governmental representative, so in fact &#x27;gubernatorial&#x27;, in a colonial entity. This was the case in the Tati Concessions Land, a gold-mining concession (territory) in the Matabele kingdom, until its annexation by the British Bechuanaland protectorate.

==Modern use==

===Australia===

A justice of the peace in Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits and to certify copies of original documents.

There are no Federal level JPs in Australia, as this power is devolved to the State and Territory Governments. Where a Federal Government document or task requires the services of a JP, the rules of each individual State or Territory government will dictate if they have the authority to assist. Criteria for appointment vary widely, depending on the state.

====Australian Capital Territory====

In the Australian Capital Territory (Colloquially, &quot;The ACT&quot;), there is only the single level of &#x27;Justice of the Peace&#x27;. They are appointed on an as-needed basis, and a potential appointee must be an Australian Citizen, and both a resident of, and enrolled on the electoral roll, of the territory. They must also not be an undischarged bankrupt, and consent to criminal history checks being undertaken prior to appointment.

Appointment is for life, unless a JP resigns, is suspended/dismissed from office, or resides outside of the ACT for a period of more than 12 consecutive months.

JPs for the ACT also cover the Australian External Territory of Norfolk Island, and the Internal Jervis Bay Territory, subject to local law variations in those two jurisdictions.

====Queensland====
In the state of Queensland, a &quot;justice of the peace (qualified)&quot; has the additional powers to issue search warrants and arrest warrants and, in conjunction with another justice of the peace (qualified) constitute a magistrates&#x27; court for exercising powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings.

Some justices are appointed as justice of the peace (magistrates&#x27; court), usually in remote Aboriginal communities, to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate.

In Queensland, a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP (Magistrate&#x27;s Court). A commissioner for declarations (C.dec) has powers limited to witnessing documents, witnessing statutory declarations, witnessing affidavits, witnessing and administering oaths and affirmations.

The first woman to become a JP in Queensland was Matilda (Maud) Hennessey of Mackay on 24 April 1918.

====Victoria====
Justices of the peace and bail justices, who are also volunteers, are appointed to serve a semi-judicial function in all areas of the Victorian community. The main official roles in the Victorian community include witnessing statutory declarations, witnessing affidavits and hearing bail matters outside court hours (bail justices only).

The first woman to become a JP in Victoria was Mary Catherine Rogers who, in 1920, became the first woman councillor in Australia when she was elected in the City of Richmond.

Justices of the peace provide a service to the community as independent witnesses of statutory declarations, powers of attorney and affidavits. JPs, who are also volunteers, are selected through an extensive interview, written exam and practical testing. They are recommended by the state attorney-general and appointed by the governor-in-council, and it is their job to authorise and witness statutory declarations and affidavits within the state of Victoria. As of August 2022, there are currently around 3500 JPs and bail justices in Victoria, who collectively sign more than 1.5 million documents and assist more than 350,000 people each year.

Justices of the Peace and Bail Justices may use the post-nominals JP and BJ respectively after their names.

===== Bail justices =====
The primary role of a bail justice is to hear bail applications, including after-hours bail, (under the Bail Act 1977 (Vic)) and to hear applications for Interim Accommodation Orders for children (under the Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 (Vic)) within Victoria. Bail justices can also witness Victorian statutory declarations and affidavits. Bail justices are appointed for terms of four years and may be re-appointed repeatedly until they attain 70 years of age. They are often required to attend call outs and rule on bail applications or protection applications for children in danger on weekends and late at night when the courts are closed. Candidates must successfully complete a three-day training course run by the Department of Justice. Bail justices, also have some limited powers under federal legislation, including the power to conduct interstate extradition hearings and extending question time for federal police.

==== New South Wales ====
The most common functions performed by a justice of the peace in New South Wales are to witness the signing of a statutory declaration, witness the signing of an affidavit and certify that a copy of an original document is a true copy.

JPs are appointed by the Governor of New South Wales for five-year terms. They are volunteers, who come from all walks of life and all sections of the community. JPs are people who are trusted to be honest, careful and impartial when performing the functions of a JP. They must not charge a fee or accept a gift for providing JP services, tell people what to write in a statutory declaration or affidavit or write it for them or give them legal advice.

Ways to find a JP in New South Wales include:
1. Search the JP Public Register. The register lists all JPs for each postcode area and provides a telephone contact number for JPs who serve the community directly. 
2. Check a public listing of scheduled JP services to find when JPs are available at scheduled times and locations across the state.

In the early years of the Colony of New South Wales, justices of the peace had far greater responsibilities and broader roles in the administration of justice than now.

====South Australia====
In South Australia, there are two types of justices: justice of the peace and special justices.

A justice of the peace in South Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations, affidavits, waiver rights, search warrants, drug warrants, divorce documents, and to certify copies of original documents and to witness the signing of power of attorney and guardianship documents, providing the JP is satisfied with the capability of the signatory.

A Special Justice (SJ) is a higher level of justice of the peace in South Australia; they sit on the bench of the magistrates&#x27; court hearing cases in the petty sessions division.

The South Australian Attorney-General has set up a web site to locate justices of the peace. The majority of metropolitan and many regional Councils (Local Government authorities) have a rotational justice of the peace in residence at nominated times.

South Australia&#x27;s first women justices were appointed in July 1915.

====Western Australia====
Justices of the peace in Western Australia are appointed by the Governor who authorises them to carry out a wide range of official administrative and judicial duties in the community.

As well as presiding in the Magistrates Court, justices of the peace are regularly called upon by the WA Police to sign search warrants and authorise the issuing of summonses. The administrative tasks include witnessing affidavits and documents such as wills and statutory declarations.

&quot;Visiting justices&quot; are a special group of justices of the peace, appointed to preside over cases within the prison system.

JPs for Western Australia also cover the Australian External Territories of Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island.

===Belgium===
In Belgium, the justices of the peace (, , ) function as the small claims courts in the country&#x27;s judicial system; they stand at the bottom of the Belgian judicial hierarchy and only handle civil cases. There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. The judgments made by the justices of the peace can, with some exceptions, be appealed to the tribunals of first instance.

===Canada===
In Canada, justices of the peace play a role in the administration of justice at the provincial level. Justices are generally appointed by the lieutenant governors of Canada&#x27;s provinces, and by the commissioners of Canada&#x27;s territories, on the advice of their relevant premier or Attorney General. Canada made the second (first was in South Australia a year earlier) appointment in the then British Empire of a woman as a magistrate, namely Emily Murphy, who was sworn in as a police magistrate in the Women&#x27;s Court of the City of Edmonton (Alberta) on 19 June 1916.

==== British Columbia ====
In British Columbia, pursuant to the &quot;Provincial Court Act&quot;, all judges are justices of the peace, and hence all of them are peace officers.

==== Northwest Territories ====
In the Northwest Territories, justices may hear summary conviction matters, municipal by-laws, and certain criminal matters. However, in more populated provinces justices usually preside over bail hearings and provincial offences courts. When not in a court session, a justice can perform other judicial functions, such as issuing search warrants.

==== Ontario ====
In Ontario, justices of the peace can preside over judicial interim release (bail) hearings and other criminal hearings. JPs can also exercise jurisdiction over provincial regulatory offences and municipal by-law prosecutions. JPs must retire by reaching the age of 65, but may continue working until 75 subject to the approval of the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice.

==== Quebec ====
In Quebec, there are two type of justices of the peace, administrative justice of the peace and presiding justice of the peace.

Administrative justice of the peace are court officers appointed by the Minister of Justice, and perform duties such as receiving criminal informations and issuing warrants. Presiding justice of the peace are appointed by commission under the Great Seal, and can try some criminal matters and issue warrants. They are appointed from advocates of at least ten years&#x27; standing and serve full-time until the age of 70.

==== Yukon ====
In Yukon, justices of the peace are lay officers of the court. They sit in the Justice of the Peace Court, which is part of the Territorial Court of Yukon.

===Bangladesh===
The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898
( ACT NO. V OF 1898 )

Chapter II OF THE CONSTITUTION OF CRIMINAL COURTS AND OFFICES

25. In virtue of their respective offices, the Judges of the Supreme Court are Justices of the Peace within and for of the whole of Bangladesh, Sessions Judges, Chief Judicial Magistrate and Metropolitan Magistrates are Justices of the Peace within their respective jurisdictions.

(Justice of the peace for the mafassal)
22. The Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, appoint such persons resident within Bangladesh and not being the subjects of any foreign State as it thinks fit to be Justices of the Peace within and for the local area mentioned in such notification.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the historical functions of justices of the peace have been replaced by full-time, legally qualified magistrates. Nowadays, justices of the peace are essentially titles of honour given by the Government to community leaders, and to certain officials while they are in their terms of offices. They have no judicial functions, and their main duties include visiting prisons, institutions for young offenders and drug addicts, psychiatric hospitals, remand homes, places of refuge, reception and detention centres, administering statutory declarations, and serving as members of advisory panels. They also monitor the drawing of the Mark Six to ensure fairness.

===India===
In India, justices of the peace exist, but no longer occupy a prominent post. One of the famous justices in India was Kavasji Jamshedji Petigara.

===Ireland===
&#x27;Justices of the peace&#x27; existed in Ireland prior to 1922, sitting in a bench under the supervision of resident magistrates at petty sessions to try minor offences summarily, and with a county court judge (in his capacity of chairman of quarter sessions) and jury to try more serious offences at quarter sessions. In the Irish Free State the position was effectively abolished by the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 and permanently abolished by the Courts of Justice Act 1924. Their judicial powers were replaced by full-time, salaried, legally qualified district justices (now called district judges) and their quasi-judicial powers by unpaid lay peace commissioners. However, the power of Peace Commissioners has been reduced following a number of Supreme Court Challenges. Even one Government Department stopped accepting Peace Commissioner signatures because &quot;there is no available updated register or reliable data base to confirm that the person signing the form as a witness is in fact a Peace Commissioner. In the absence of such verification being possible, the practice was changed to remove the risk of fraudulent activity and maintain the integrity of the process.&quot; In general, Peace commissioners may sign statutory declarations, and may rarely issue summons and search warrants to the Garda Síochána (Irish police). A peace commissioner can witness the signature of an affidavit. In addition Peace Commissioners can sign custody agreements between legal guardians in relation to visitation etc. These agreements are legally binding and can be altered only by a Judge in the regular courts. Peace Commissioners are appointed on the basis of good character and usually prominent standing in their local communities.

===Jamaica===
A justice of the peace, according to the Ministry of Justice, is a person of unquestionable integrity who seeks to promote and protect the rights of the individual and helps to provide justice to persons in a particular community. Additionally, the JP serves as a justice in petty court sessions, attends juvenile court sessions, issues summonses, considers applications for bail, explains and signs legal documents, sits on licensing panels, and gives counsel/advice. Any Jamaican citizen that can speak and write English is eligible to become a JP. Any club/organisation/citizen can recommend someone to become JP for a community. JPs are chosen under the Governor-General&#x27;s discretion.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, justices of the peace (&quot;jaksa pendamai&quot; in Malay, also abbreviated JP) have largely been replaced in magistrates&#x27; courts by legally qualified (first-class) stipendiary magistrates. However, state governments continue to appoint justices of the peace as honours. In 2004, some associations of justices of the peace pressed the federal government to allow justices of the peace to sit as second-class magistrates in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts.

===New Zealand===
The legal framework for the office of Justice of the Peace within New Zealand is derived from the Act of Parliament &#x27;Justices of the Peace Act 1957&#x27;, and subsequent amendments.

There are two levels of this position within New Zealand: The standard level of &#x27;Justice of the Peace&#x27;, and a separate &#x27;Judicial Justice of the Peace&#x27;. Persons so appointed may use the post-nominals JP and JJP respectively. A JP who is retired may apply to the Secretary for Justice for permission to use the post-nominals &#x27;JP (retired)&#x27;.

Appointment as a JP is for life, unless a voluntary resignation is tendered in writing, or a JP is suspended or dismissed from office due to misconduct, bankruptcy, or other specific reasons.

====Justice of the Peace====
A JP in New Zealand is someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign a number of documents, including statutory declarations, affidavits, and producing certified copies of documents, amongst others. In some limited circumstances they may also perform citizenship ceremonies, and act as a &#x27;Visiting Justice&#x27; in prisons. They are nominated for office by local Members of Parliament and appointed by the Governor-General. They must take both the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath.

====Judicial Justice====
If a local JP Federation determines that a need for one or more JJPs exists, they will issue a call for nominations to JPs in their territory. Following closure of nominations, a shortlist will be drawn up, and interviews undertaken. If a prospective applicant passes the interview stage, and the relevant training, exams, and assignments are successfully completed, they can be sworn in as a JJP. This means they can then be assigned to the bench in the relevant District Court to oversee minor criminal cases. These would involve tasks such as the exercise of powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings.

Appointment as a JJP is at the pleasure of the Secretary for Justice, generally for a minimum of 5 years, and for as long as there is a need in the area an individual resides. Should an individual move abroad, to an area of New Zealand where the service is no longer required, or the local area no longer requires it, the JJP appointment will be terminated.

====Issuing Officer====
Prior to 2012, all JPs were able to issue search and arrest warrants, but with the passage of the NZ Act of Parliament &quot;Search and Surveillance Act 2012&quot;, this power was spun off to the separate position of Issuing Officer.

Under the law, an Issuing Officer does not have to be a Justice of the Peace - Holders of some positions within the judicial system (e.g. Registrar or Deputy Registrar of a court) are Issuing Officers automatically under the law while serving in those roles, and cease to be so when they are not. For a JP or JJP to exercise this power after 2012, they must apply to become an Issuing Officer separately. The application process involves a further training course and exam, followed by a vetting and approval process by the Attorney-General. Appointment as an Issuing Officer is for a maximum of three years, and may be renewed for a further three years at expiry as needed.

===Pakistan===
Sections 22, 22-A and 22-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 provide for the appointment of justices of the peace by the provincial governments, their powers and duties respectively. However, seldom are justices of the peace appointed in Pakistan outside the judiciary. Session and additional session judges act as ex-officio justices of the peace as per Section 25 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. An Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding-
(i) non-registration of a criminal case;
(ii) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another; and
(iii) neglect, failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its functions and duties.
Such functions being quasi-judicial in nature could not be termed as executive, administrative or ministerial.(PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581)

It is pertinent to note however, as many academics have pointed out, that there is great utility in the appointment of such justices especially in rural areas where enmity between rival groups can lead to the inability of registration of cognizable offences and biased judicial proceedings.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the functions of Justices of the Peace have been replaced by full-time, legally qualified magistrates. JP in Singapore are appointed amongst outstanding individuals in Singapore who have made significant contributions in their professions, the public service, social services and the community at large by the President of the Republic of Singapore, under section 11(1) of the State Courts Act 1970 for a renewable five-year term. 

JP do not serve any judicial roles, rather they derive their functions from statute. Some examples of the functions, powers and duties of a Justice of the Peace includes:
* In accordance with the Prisons Act 1933, a JP who is appointed as a Visiting Justice may visit any Singapore prisons at any time to ascertain whether the prison regulations are adhered to. A JP may also upon receiving a report of an aggravated prison offence, investigate the charge and punish the prisoner if found guilty for up to 30 days confinement and 24 strokes of the cane.
* May under the Societies Act 1966, enter or authorize any police officer to enter any place if they believe that a meeting of an unlawful society is being held there. They may also issue a search warrant to seize any items connected to the unlawful society and warrant of arrest on any persons found in that place.
* Administer oaths under the Trade Marks Act 1998, Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and Parliamentary Elections Act 1954 and Presidential Elections Act 1991.

Other roles of a JP includes being mediators in the State Courts of Singapore or marriage solemnisers in the Registry of Marriages. 

Newly appointed justices of the peace are required by Section 17 of the State Courts Act to take the oath of office and allegiance as set out in the schedule to the State Courts Act, before exercising the functions of their good office. The President may also revoke the appointment of any Justice of the Peace.

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, Justice of the Peace is an honorary post, with authorisation to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits as well as certify documents. Persons appointed as a Justice of the Peace may use the post-nominal JP. Current appointments are made under the &quot;Judicature Act No 02 of 1978&quot;, by the Minister of Justice at his/her discretion by publishing a list in &quot;The Gazette&quot; and appointee taking oaths before a high court, district court judge or magistrate with registrar of the supreme court recording it. There are four types of appointments of Justice of the Peace;
* Justice of the Peace and Unofficial magistrate
* Justice of the Peace for the Whole Island
* Justice of the Peace for a Judicial District 
* Justice of the Peace (ex officio)

Senior Attorney at laws are appointed as Justice of the Peace and Unofficial magistrates to preside in the absence of a sitting Magistrate. Any citizen of Sri Lanka can apply to the Ministry of Justice giving his or her credentials to be appointed as a justice of the peace. However, the applicant should be one who has served the public and carries out social service and should be of good standing. These JPs would be appointed with legal authority in all parts of the island or limited to a judicial district. The President of Sri Lanka and his/her officers are &quot;ex officio&quot; justices of the peace. There about 100,000 JPs in the island.

The post was introduced in the island during the British colonial era by the Governor Frederick North in 1801 and was later reformed in 1871. Until 1938, appointments were made by the Governor, after which appointments were made by the Legal Secretary until 1947. After Ceylon gained its independence in 1948, appointments were made by the Governor General and the Minister of Justice. Justice of the Peace had the power to administer oaths and affirmations per the &quot;Courts Ordinance No. 1 on 1889 section 84&quot; and they could formally appoint members of the public to act as special police officers in times of turmoil and riots. Since certain government officers were ex-officio justices of the peace, this allowed British colonial officers to appoint special police officers from the European planters in times of crisis such as the 1915 riots. The Village Councils Law (No. 6 of 1964) made the Chairman of the Village Council an &quot;ex officio&quot; justices of the peace for that village area.

===Tonga===
In 2014, for the first time, Justices of the Peace were authorised in Tonga. JPs are appointed by the Crown, but the Lord Chief Justice regulates their duties and defines their powers. The first JPs were warranted with duties including granting bail; issuing search warrants and subpoenas; taking affidavits, declarations and oaths; and having the power to witness documents. Term of office is one year and officials can be reappointed. The initial 19 JPs appointed were: ‘Aisea Ta’ofi and Sione Hinakau of Niuatoputapu; ‘Inoke Tuaimei’api of Niuafo&#x27;ou; Siosiua Hausia from ʻEua; Sione Palu, Sione Fakahua, Me’ite Fukofuka and Kisione Taulani of Ha’apai; Salesi Kauvaka, Viliami Pasikala, Haniteli Fa’anunu, Meli Taufaeteau and Moleni Taufa from Vava’u; and Salote Fukofuka, ‘Amelia Helu, ‘Ofa Likiliki, Tevita Fakatou, Sioape Tu’iono and Semisi Tongia of Tongatapu.

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
A magistrates&#x27; court in England and Wales is typically composed of a bench of (usually three) Justices of the Peace (otherwise known as magistrates) who dispense summary justice. They decide on offences which carry a community sentence, a prison sentence (maximum of six months for any one offence, up to one year for multiple offences), or an unlimited fine. They are advised on points of law and procedure by a legally qualified justices&#x27; clerk and their assistants. In practice, JPs have a wide range of sentencing options, which include issuing fines, imposing community orders, or dealing with offences by means of a discharge. In more serious cases, where magistrates&#x27; consider that their sentencing powers are insufficient, they can send &#x27;either-way&#x27; offenders to the Crown Court for sentencing.

Justices of the Peace are trained volunteers. No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence, common sense, integrity and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the local area and drawn from all walks of life following a rigorous selection process undertaken by a local advisory committee, who recommends to the Lord Chancellor those individuals who have demonstrated the five key qualities for appointment which are: (1) awareness of social issues; (2) maturity and understanding; (3) reliability and commitment; (4) understanding of documents and effective communication; and (5) logical thinking. Justices of the Peace are trained volunteers, but those who are employed in some occupations ( Police Officers) cannot be appointed due to potential conflict of interest.

All new Justices of the Peace undergo comprehensive training before sitting. There is a mentoring program to help guide new appointees (mentors are magistrates with at least three years&#x27; service). The training is delivered by the Judicial College and covers the necessary law and procedure required for their role. They continue to receive training throughout their judicial career, and are appraised every four years (every two years for a Presiding Justice) to check that they continue to remain competent in their role. Additional training is given to justices choosing to sit in the Youth Court, or those dealing with family matters. New JPs sit with mentors on at least six occasions during their first eighteen months. Justices of the Peace are unpaid appointees, but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses, subsistence, and loss of earnings for those not paid by their employer while sitting as a magistrate, up to £116.78 a day. Such person may sit at any magistrates&#x27; court in England and Wales, but in practice they are appointed to their local bench (a colloquial and legal term for the local court). Justices of the Peace often sit as a panel of three; two as a minimum in most cases, save for cases under the Single Justice Procedure. Many are members of the Magistrates&#x27; Association, which provides advice, training and represents magistrates. Justices of the Peace must sit for a minimum of 26 sessions (half-days) per year. An employer must, by law, allow a Justice of the Peace reasonable time off work to serve as such.

The lead magistrate is known as a Presiding Justice (PJ) and should be addressed in court as &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; or &quot;your worship&quot;, and the magistrates collectively as &quot;your worships&quot;. In writing they are their usual name followed by &quot;JP&quot; (for Justice of the Peace). Other magistrates on the bench are known as &quot;wingers&quot;. All three magistrates contribute equally to the decision-making and carry equal authority, but the Presiding Justice will speak on their behalf in open court.

Magistrates&#x27; courts today can deal with lesser offences such as all summary offences, and some more serious triable &#x27;either-way&#x27; matters, but where the magistrates&#x27; deem that their sentencing powers are sufficient. However all criminal cases start in the magistrates&#x27; court. They handle over 95% of the criminal cases in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. With more serious offences, magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the Crown Court (a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury). Magistrates also have a civil jurisdiction, such as a family jurisdiction, or appeals against matters relating to licensing. Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor, betting and clubs licensing applications, this was transferred under the Licensing Act 2003 to local authorities. The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority. Justices of the Peace are responsible for granting orders such as search warrants to the Police and other authorities. They used to have to live within 15 miles of where they sit in case needed to sign a warrant after hours. were replaced with &quot;Local Justice Areas&quot; by the Courts Act 2003, meaning this is not formally required. Section 7 of the Courts Act 2003 states that &quot;There shall be a commission of the peace for England and Wales—…b) addressed generally, and not by name, to all such persons as may from time to time hold office as justices of the peace for England and Wales&quot;. Thus, every magistrate in England and Wales may act as a magistrate anywhere there.

Cardiff Magistrates&#x27; Court is the only court in the country which deals with offences under the Companies Act 2006, such as for late filing of accounts or directors&#x27; offences. Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court has special responsibilities for dealing with terrorism and extradition offences throughout the UK.

The Courts Act 2003 provides the current framework for appointment of the justices, which is done by the Lord Chancellor in the name of sovereign. Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism.

Before 1714, magistrates were liable to be approached at any time and in any place by people legally recognised as paupers, appealing for aid if parish authorities refused to provide any. It was relatively common for these magistrates to write out, on the spot, an order requiring aid to be granted. The magistracy is an ancient institution, dating in England from at least 1327. The role is underpinned by the principles of &#x27;local justice&#x27; and &#x27;justice by one&#x27;s peers.&#x27;

As at 2021, 56% of sitting magistrates were women, 13% were black, Asian and minority ethnic, and 82% aged above 50 as at 1 April 2021.

====Scotland====

Within the Scottish legal system Justices of the Peace are trained volunteers who currently sit in the Justice of the Peace courts. These courts were introduced in 2009 as a replacement for the district courts (established in 1975), which in turn replaced burgh police courts. Justices sit alone or in threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court. They handle many cases of breaches of the peace – drunkenness, minor assaults, petty theft, and offences under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.

The maximum sentencing power of a justice of the peace is 60 days imprisonment, or a fine up to £2,500, or both, and the ability to disqualify drivers.

In 2006, the Scottish Government announced its intention to unify the management of the sheriff and district courts in Scotland but retain lay justices, as part of its initiative to create a unified judiciary under the Lord President. Following the passage of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 the justice of the peace courts were implemented on a sheriffdom-by-sheriffdom basis.

In Glasgow, the volume of business required the employment of three solicitors as &quot;stipendiary magistrates&quot; who sat in place of the lay justices. The stipendiary magistrates&#x27; court had the same sentencing power as the summary sheriff court in summary proceedings, which was the ability to sentence an offender to up to one year in prison or fine them up to . Stipendiary magistrates were replaced by summary sheriffs.

====Northern Ireland====

In Northern Ireland, the situation initially continued as it had in pre-1922 Ireland. However, justices of the peace no longer sat out of petty sessions after 1935 (Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1935). Since then, magistrates&#x27; courts in Northern Ireland have consisted of legally qualified resident magistrates (now known as district judges (magistrates&#x27; courts)) sitting alone, except in cases involving children, where two lay panelists sat with the magistrate. Justices of the peace were confined to the power to conduct committal hearings, bind persons over to the peace, sign warrants, summons, and other official documents. They were appointed by the Lord Chancellor on the recommendation of a committee in each county court division.

The Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 introduced a new office of lay magistrate, to sit alongside resident magistrates at magistrates&#x27; courts in certain matters. Unlike in England and Wales, &quot;lay magistrate&quot; is the official title of the position, to distinguish from existing justices of the peace who do not sit in the magistrates&#x27; courts. The first lay magistrates were appointed in 2005. Two lay magistrates sit with the district judge (magistrates&#x27; court) in criminal proceedings involving children (replacing the former lay panelists) and Family Proceedings Court matters. The district judge (magistrates&#x27; court), who is a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing, presides over the bench. Most criminal justice functions of JPs were transferred to lay magistrates. It is expected that there will be no further appointments of justices of the peace in Northern Ireland, although those already appointed retain the title and any functions not transferred to lay magistrate under the 2002 Act.

===United States===
In some US states, the justice of the peace is a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction, a magistrate, or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers. Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office.

The justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts, landlord and tenant disputes, or other small claims court proceedings. Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts. In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a trial de novo before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered.

A justice of the peace also performs civil marriages.

====Arizona====
A justice of the peace has the same jurisdiction as a municipal magistrate with respect to traffic and misdemeanor cases and restraining orders, though over cases whose affairs are not contained within the confines of a single municipality. Additionally, the Justice Court hears cases involving county ordinances (ordinances enacted by the board of supervisors that apply only to unincorporated areas), civil lawsuits up to a limit of $10,000, small claims cases up to $2,500 (up to $3,500 in Maricopa County), and issues evictions, called writs of restitution (after a forcible detainer or special detainer action (eviction) being successfully completed by a landlord). Justices of the peace, also called JPs, or Judges of the Justice Court, are elected in partisan elections for four-year terms from specific districts called precincts. They have the same authority and responsibility as all other judges in the state with respect to performing marriages, administering oaths, adhering to the code of judicial conduct, and all aspects of justice administration. However, Arizona law does not require justices of the peace to be lawyers. Many justices of the peace are not legally trained, although all are required by the Arizona Supreme Court to complete a course at the Arizona Judicial College. As with JPs, municipal judges in Arizona are not required to be lawyers.

====Arkansas====

In Arkansas, a justice of the peace is an elected official equivalent to a county commissioner or county supervisor in some other states. Arkansas JPs sit on a county quorum court, composed of 9, 11, 13 or 15 JPs. The quorum court is a part-time body, elected from single-member districts, that has overall responsibility for county affairs. Among their responsibilities are passing the budget, creating new ordinances (at the misdemeanor level), setting property tax millage levels, and working with other elected officials. The full-time elected county administrator, who presides over the quorum court, is the county judge. Neither JPs nor the county judge have any judicial authority, though they do have the power to preside over civil marriages. Justices of the peace are elected every two years to these partisan offices.

====Connecticut====

Justices of the peace in Connecticut can preside over marriages. Unlike some states, Connecticut JPs are not penalized for refusing to perform such ceremonies. They have the same general oath-giving powers as a notary public.

====Florida====

Florida had justices of the peace (with corresponding constables) from the time of its acquisition from Spain in 1821 until the Florida Constitution was amended in 1968 to abolish the post. From about 1940 to 1968, Florida counties had the ability to hold local referendums to allow county voters to abolish the post on a county-by-county basis. For example, Leon County, the location of Tallahassee, Florida&#x27;s capital city, voted to abolish justices of the peace (and their associated constables) in the Fall elections of 1958. By 1958, the county commission had reduced the number of JOP districts from a turn-of-the-century peak of 13 districts to just two districts. The automobile age made the county sheriff able to patrol the entire county and made it possible for the citizenry to travel to the courthouse for legal proceedings.

====Louisiana====
Justices of the peace in Louisiana are elected to serve six-year terms as the judicial authority of a ward or district, but not where city courts exist. They have jurisdiction in civil matters when the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000. They do not have jurisdiction when a title to real estate is involved, when the state or any political subdivision is a defendant, or in successions or probate matters. They are authorized to perform marriage ceremonies. There are around 390 such Justices of the peace.

====Maine====
In Maine, the office of the Justice of the Peace was merged with Notary Public, a process that took place from 1981 to 1988. The duties that were attached to the office of Justice of the Peace were fully transferred to the Notary Public in 1988. The office currently named as &quot;Justice of the Peace&quot; in Maine is a court officer, an attorney, involved in the process of issuing warrants and responding to complaints. The office however is not related to either the current Notary Public office or the previous Justice of the Peace office and is part of the Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections &amp; Commissions.

====Massachusetts====

Justices of the peace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are commissioned by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Council for seven-year terms. They are often called on to solemnize non-religious marriages, especially same-sex marriages, which certain religious officials are not willing to oversee. They have the same general oath-giving powers as a notary public, and are also empowered to issue certain writs. Justices of peace are also empowered to keep the peace and suppress riots, and enforce all laws that keep public peace. Furthermore, upon the recommendation of a town selectman, they may be authorized by the governor to take bail in criminal cases.

====Minnesota====

In Minnesota, the office of the Justice of the Peace was abolished in 1977 (Minn. Stat. 487.35). It has not existed for 40-plus years although some people who offer private wedding officiant services erroneously claim to be Justices of the Peace, this term may not properly be used inasmuch as the office has been abolished. Under Minnesota law, however, judges, retired judges, court administrators, retired court administrators, and other public officials designated in statute may officiate or solemnize marriage ceremonies in addition to licensed or ordained ministers of any religious denomination who have filed their credentials with a county registrar (Minn, Stat. 517.04).

====New York====
Justice courts are courts in New York State that handle traffic tickets, criminal and environmental conservation law matters, small claims and local code violations such as zoning. Though justice courts constitutionally are part of the New York State Unified Court System, state law generally makes justice courts independent of New York&#x27;s Office of Court Administration (OCA) and instead makes justice courts the responsibility of their sponsoring localities. Town justice courts are often called town courts, and village justice courts are often called village courts. City courts in New York State handle mostly the same types of cases but are not justice courts.

The official title for judges in justice courts is justice, the same as in New York Supreme Court. However, in common usage, most people, including lawyers, call them judge. In general, justices in justice court do not have to be lawyers, except for justice courts with jurisdiction in villages. The vast majority are not. Many of these courts are in small towns and villages where none of the residents are lawyers. In the larger towns, the justices are almost always lawyers.

While justices and their court clerks receive training from OCA, there is tremendous variability in how cases are handled. This includes court procedures and substantive results. Some courts will dismiss a traffic ticket if the officer does not appear for a trial, while others will adjourn the matter to give the officer another chance. In some courts the police prosecute their own tickets, while in others an assistant district attorney from the county or a town or village attorney will prosecute the tickets. This may even vary by the type of officer, with state troopers and deputies prosecuting their tickets and a town attorney prosecuting tickets written by the town police.

Larger towns can have very busy caseloads, including several sessions a week with dozens of cases at each session, and people may have to wait hours before their cases are heard. In some small towns the caseload is extremely light, and a court might meet once a month and have only a few cases.

All criminal prosecutions that occur in towns and villages are commenced in a justice court. Misdemeanors are handled exclusively in the justice court, while felonies generally move up to county court after defendants are arraigned in a Justice Court before the case moves forward.

Similar matters in some places outside New York are handled by a justice of the peace.

Town and village Justices also possess limited powers of a New York notary public, ex-officio, only within the county in which the town or village for which they serve is located; they may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments and proofs of execution. Some Justices seek and obtain a formal New York notary public commission to permit free travel statewide and enjoy the additional privileges and international legal recognition of a notary public.

====New Hampshire====
New Hampshire justices of the peace are commissioned magisterial officers, appointed by the Governor and Executive Council to terms of five years, with the power to administer oaths, acknowledge instruments, perform marriage ceremonies and, effective 1 January 2008, solemnize civil unions for same-sex couples. They may also order compulsory mental examinations for good cause, act as a magisterial official regarding enforcement complaints on orders for isolation or quarantine issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services, administer oaths of office to public officials, take depositions and issue subpoenas. New Hampshire justices of the peace are also authorized, upon a showing of probable cause supported by affidavit, to issue arrest warrants, search warrants, administrative inspection warrants and by court appointment, to fix and receive bail in criminal cases.

====North Carolina====

Justices of the peace existed during the time of the Province of North Carolina (17121776.) They were appointed by the colonial Governor and served in counties or districts. Justices were essential for conducting court business. After independence, the 1776 Constitution of North Carolina and an act passed by the North Carolina General Assembly of 1777 re-defined justices of peace in the State of North Carolina. Justices of the peace were authorized to marry and had other court duties and assisted in collecting taxes. Duties of the justices were further reduced after the 1868 North Carolina Constitution and inferior courts were abolished.

====Oregon====
See also Oregon Justice Courts

In Oregon, as of 2023, Justices of the Peace preside over 22 Justice Courts. Oregon Justices of the Peace are state court judges, even though their salary is paid by their respective counties. A Justice of the Peace is elected for a term of six years. If a Justice of the Peace position becomes vacant during the Justice&#x27;s term, the Governor appoints a Justice to fill the vacancy until the next general election.

In Oregon, Justices of the Peace have jurisdiction over civil lawsuits of less than $10,000; evictions; misdemeanors, and violations, like traffic tickets, boating violations, and wildlife violations. Further, Justice Courts have jurisdiction over violations of the county code, and some Justice Courts act as the municipal court of certain cities. Justice courts do not have jurisdiction over certain types of civil cases, including disputes over title to real estate, false imprisonment, libel, slander, and malicious prosecution. Justices of the Peace are authorized to perform courthouse weddings in Oregon.

====Texas====
In Texas, JPs are elected on a partisan ballot every four years.

Texas does not require a JP to be an attorney in good standing. However, JPs are required to be &quot;well versed in the law&quot; and take mandatory classes to retain their office. New JPs are required to take 80 hours of legal, state-mandated classes the first year, and 20 hours each year thereafter during their tenure in office.

Sections 18 and 19 of Article V of the Texas Constitution, as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.

Under Section 18, the number of JPs (and associated constables) is dependent on the size of the county:
*For counties with populations less than 18,000 (as determined by the census), the entire county shall be a one JP precinct, unless the Commissioners&#x27; Court determines that more are needed, in which case the court can divide the county into no more than four JP precincts.
*For counties with populations at least 18,000 but less than 50,000, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than two nor more than eight.
*For counties with populations 50,000 or greater, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than four nor more than eight.
*In any county with population less than 150,000, if any precinct contains a city with 18,000 or more population, that precinct shall have two JPs.
*In any county with population 150,000 or greater, each JP precinct may have more than one JP.
*Special provisions apply to Chambers and Randall counties (must have no fewer than two nor more than six precincts) and to Mills, Reagan, and Roberts (the Constable office is abolished, with the Sheriff&#x27;s office performing all duties).

Section 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court:
*Original jurisdiction in &quot;criminal matters of misdemeanor cases punishable by fine only&quot; (under the Texas Penal Code such offenses are called &quot;Class C&quot; misdemeanors, generally involving traffic offenses or public intoxication; however, in jurisdictions with a municipal court, if the traffic offense is written by a municipal police officer the municipal court will have jurisdiction, whereas if the offense is written by a state or county officer the JP court will hear the case),
*Exclusive jurisdiction in &quot;civil matters where the amount in controversy is $200 or less&quot;, and
*&quot;Such other jurisdiction as may be provided by law&quot;. Under this provision, the Legislature has raised the top limit on civil matters to $10,000 and assigned the JP courts, among others, the right to hear cases involving eviction as well as cases involving foreclosure and liens against personal property where the amount falls within the (revised) JP Court&#x27;s jurisdiction.

JP cases are appealed to the county court level; the appeal results in a trial de novo. In criminal cases, cases beginning in justice court cannot be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted.

In smaller counties without a coroner, the JP has the duty to perform inquests. The JP is also called out for any unattended deaths in the county.

A JP in a large precinct in a large county will work 5 days a week, 8 or more hours daily. Their duties will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: trials of civil matters, both to a 6-person jury and to the bench, with an amount in controversy not exceeding $20,000.00. Trials of criminal matters involving traffic violations and class C misdemeanors punishable by fine only. Pre-trial motion dockets and show-cause hearings are held, and all discovery must be approved by the Judge in advance in civil cases. All criminal matters are controlled by the rules of criminal procedure and evidence. A much more restricted and smaller set of rules apply in civil matters unless, in the Judge&#x27;s discretion, it is believed to be in the best interests of justice to apply the standard rules of evidence and procedure. The court has the exclusive jurisdiction of evictions. A Texas JP Judge will also magistrate prisoners and set bail. The Judge will hear juvenile violations such as truancy, underage drinking and smoking. Warrants of Arrest, Alias, Search and Capias Profine are issued. Protective Orders can be issued and result in jail time if violated. Several administrative matters are heard including the finding of a Dangerous Dog, Occupational Drivers License and tow hearings. Many writs are issued such as writs of re-entry to apartments, possession of realty and to reinstate utilities a landlord may have turned off. A JP has contempt power of $100 and up to 3 days in jail per occurrence. A JP is also authorized to perform marriage ceremonies.

====Vermont====
Justices in Vermont are elected county officials, serving two-year terms. They are elected from each town or city within a county, and the number of justices elected from each municipality varies based on population, from as few as 3 or 5, to as many as 12 or 15. They generally serve as election, poll, and town meeting officials, and sit on the boards of civil authority and tax abatement within their municipalities. When assembled as the board of civil authority, they have the authority to decide, in the first instance, election disputes and disagreements about whether a voter should be registered. When the assessed value of property for real estate tax purposes is appealed to the board of civil authority, at least three board members are appointed to inspect the property. They may perform civil marriages throughout the state and are eligible to serve as notaries without payment of the usual registration fee. Justices may also serve as a magistrate when commissioned by the Supreme Court.

The option to serve as a magistrate has never been invoked and likely never will be; in June 2019 Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court Marilyn Skoglund described the idea of commissioning a justice of the peace as an actual magistrate as &quot;a truly frightening idea&quot; and stated that she had never heard of such a thing actually happening.

====Wyoming====
Esther Hobart Morris became the first female justice of the peace in the United States in 1870. She began her tenure as justice in South Pass City, Wyoming, on February 14, 1870, serving a term of nearly 9 months. The Sweetwater County Board of County Commissioners appointed Morris as justice of the peace after the previous justice, R.S. Barr, resigned in protest of Wyoming Territory&#x27;s passage of the women&#x27;s suffrage amendment in December 1869.

====Replacement with other courts====
In many states, the office of justice of the peace has been abolished or transferred to another court, such as the magistrate court. Cases in large cities may be heard in a municipal court which has jurisdiction only within that city. Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the American Bar Association, which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary, as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used.

California formerly had justice of the peace courts staffed by lay judges, but began phasing them out after a landmark 1974 decision in which the Supreme Court of California unanimously held that it was a violation of federal due process (in the state&#x27;s view of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) to allow a nonlawyer to preside over a criminal trial which could result in incarceration of the defendant. The court specifically recognized that in the aftermath of &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; (1963), it was unreasonable to allow a case to be tried before a layperson incapable of understanding the legal arguments of the defense attorney to whom the defendant was entitled under &quot;Gideon&quot;. In 1994, the remaining justice courts were consolidated into the municipal courts by the passage of Proposition 191, and in 1998, the electorate passed Proposition 220, which authorized the merger of the remaining municipal courts (the only remaining courts of inferior jurisdiction) into the superior courts (the courts of general jurisdiction). However, the judges affected by each merger in each county had to affirmatively consent and the municipal court judges then had to formally become superior court judges. This process was completed on February 8, 2001, when California&#x27;s last four municipal court judges were sworn in as superior court judges in Kern County. Under current California law, all California judges must be licensed attorneys at the time they join the bench.

However, the Supreme Court of the United States held in &quot;North v. Russell&quot;, , that the use of nonlawyer judges in Kentucky&#x27;s system of police courts accords with the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.

<doc id="260972" wikidata="Q44530" url="?curid=260972" title="Maximilian II of Bavaria">
<text>Maximilian II (28 November 1805 – 10 March 1864) reigned as King of Bavaria between 1848 and 1864.

Unlike his father, King Ludwig I, &quot;King Max&quot; was very popular and took a greater interest in the business of Government than in personal extravagance. Ascending the throne during the German Revolution of 1848, King Maximilian restored stability in his kingdom. The rest of his reign was characterized by attempts to maintain Bavarian independence during the wars of German Unification and to transform his capital city of Munich into a cultural and educational city.

==Crown Prince==
He was born in Munich and was the eldest son of the Crown Prince of Bavaria (later King Ludwig I) and his wife Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen.

After studying at Göttingen and Berlin and travelling in Germany, Italy and Greece, he was introduced by his father into the council of state (1836). From the first, he showed a studious disposition and declared on one occasion that had he not been born in a royal cradle, his choice would have been to become a professor. As crown prince, in the chateau of Hohenschwangau near Füssen, which he had rebuilt, he gathered about him an intimate society of artists and men of learning and devoted his time to scientific and historical study. The Wittelsbacher Palais was built for Maximilian as a Crown Prince Palace in Munich but was completed only when he ascended the throne.

==King==
When the abdication of Ludwig I (20 March 1848) called him suddenly to the throne, his choice of ministers promised a liberal regime.

===Domestic policy===
In 1849 an uprising in the Bavarian Palatinate was broken down with the support of the Prussian Army.

Though from 1850 onwards his government tended in the direction of absolute monarchy, King Maximilian steered a moderate course between the extremes of classical liberalism, Prussian-inspired Pan-Germanism, and the so-called &quot;Ultramontanes&quot;.

In his attempts to transform Bavaria into a centre of culture, education, and the arts, he enraged conservative Catholics and Protestants by inviting a number of celebrated men of learning (such as Geibel, Liebig, Heyse and Sybel) to Munich, regardless of their religious views.

Devoted to his family and his people, the King also financed studies of the art, costumes, dialects and customs of the Bavarian peasantry. That was done to promote a separate national identity against Prussian-inspired Pan-Germanism.

The King was assisted in that by his Personal Private Secretary, Franz Xaver von Schönwerth. A native of the Oberpfalz region of the Bavarian Kingdom, Schonwerth&#x27;s work collecting the folklore and traditions of his native district won him the admiration of the Brothers Grimm and made him a model for future folklore collectors.

===Foreign policy===
Maximilian II responded also to the demands of the people for a united German state by attending the Frankfurt Assembly which intended to create such a state. The progress of the 1848 Revolution, however, gave him pause. The king strenuously opposed the unionist plans of the Frankfurt Parliament, refused to recognize the imperial constitution devised by it and assisted Austria in restoring the federal diet and in carrying out the federal execution in Hesse-Kassel and Holstein. In the aftermath of the failure of the Frankfurt Assembly, Prussia and Austria continued to debate which monarchy had the inherent right to rule Germany.

The dispute between Austria and the Electoral Prince of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) was used by Austria and its allies, including Bavaria, to promote the isolation of Prussia in German political affairs. That diplomatic insult almost led to war when Austria, Bavaria and other allies moved troops through Bavaria towards Hesse-Kassel in 1850. However, the Prussian Army backed down and accepted the principle of dual leadership. The event was known as the Punctation of Olmütz but also as the &quot;Humiliation of Olmütz&quot; by Prussia. The event solidified the Bavarian kingdom&#x27;s alliance with Austria against Prussia.
In his German policy, Maximilian was guided by the desire to maintain the union of the princes. During the cold warfare between Austria and Prussia, King Maximilian and his ministers favoured the former, which was a policy enthusiastically supported by the Catholics and the Protestants of the Bavarian Kingdom. Simultaneously, however, the King and his Ministers also attempted to preserve Bavaria&#x27;s independence by trying to play both powers against each other. That policy continued under his son, King Ludwig II.

In 1863, however, the King supported the project of reform proposed by Austria at the .

Attempts by Austria to reorganise the loose and entirely-decentralised German Confederation were opposed by Prussia and therefore the other German princes did not act on the reform proposals. The failure of those plans and the attitude of the Austrian Court towards the Confederation and the Schleswig-Holstein Question disillusioned King Maximilian. The last days of his reign were spent attempting to deal with the new situation created by the outbreak of the war with Denmark.

===Later life===
In the summers of 1849 and 1855, King Maximilian travelled his kingdom. Between 24 June and 27 July 1858, he undertook a journey on foot through his country, which began in Lindau. However, because of frequent rain, he repeatedly had to be carried physically.

In government policy, the King repeatedly requested the advice of his ministers and scholarly experts before making a decision, which led to long delays. In addition, King Maximilian often traveled to Italy and Greece, which also led to long delays.

After a brief and unexpected illness, King Maximilian died at Munich on 10 March 1864. He is buried in the Theatinerkirche there.

==Cultural legacy==

Maximilian offered Paul Heyse and other writers from North Germany large stipends.
Hans Christian Andersen visited &quot;King Max&quot; (as he called him) in his castle Starnberg, and wrote of him as a young, highly amiable man. The King, having read his novels and fairy tales, let Andersen know that he was deeply impressed by &quot;The Improvisatore&quot;, &quot;En Digters Bazar&quot;, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Paradisets Have&quot;. During the visit Andersen also read &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;.
Later Andersen visited the King at the Schloss Hohenschwangau.

Next to Hohenschwangau Castle also the Hambach Castle was reconstructed from 1844 for Crown Prince Maximilian by August von Voit. In 1849 King Maximilian II instructed the architect Eduard Riedel to redesign Berg Castle in neo-gothic style with several towers and a crenellate.

Maximilian II was the principal of the Maximilianstrasse and the Bavarian National Museum in Munich. Compared to his father, Maximilian preferred a new architectural style with strong reference to the Gothic Revival architecture which would combine the best features of historical models combined with then modern building technology. The neo-gothic &quot;Royal Mansion&quot; in Regensburg was built for Maximilian 1854–1856, the &quot;Royal Mansion&quot; in Berchtesgaden and the &quot;Royal Villa&quot; on Rose Island already in 1853. The hiking path in Upper Bavaria called Maximiliansweg is named after him, as he made a longer hike in the Bavaria alps in the summer of 1858.
The Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art was first established on 28 November 1853 by King Maximilian II.

==Private life and family==
While king, Maximilian was hampered by constant ill health which often compelled him to travel abroad and, when at home, to live much of the time in the countryside. The relationship with his father, who had persisted in his architectural projects even after his abdication, was mostly tense. By his wife, Marie Friederike Franziska Hedwig, daughter of Prince William of Prussia, who he married in 1842, he had two sons:
* Ludwig II of Bavaria (25 August 1845 – 13 June 1886)
* Otto, King of Bavaria (27 April 1848 – 11 October 1916)
Both of his sons became king, were declared insane, and were later deposed.

<doc id="260977" wikidata="Q1640371" url="?curid=260977" title="Riverboarding">
<text>Riverboarding is a boardsport in which the participant lies prone on their board with fins on their feet for propulsion and steering. This sport is also known as hydrospeed in Europe and as riverboarding or white-water sledging in New Zealand, depending on the type of board used. Riverboarding includes commercial, recreational and the swiftwater rescue practice of using a high-flotation riverboard, designed for buoyancy in highly aerated water.

== Origins ==
Riverboarding is believed to have originated in the late 1970s. It is claimed to have originated in France, where raft guides stuffed a burlap mail sack with life vests and went down rapids. Soon, riders adapted a personal submarine shell for their molds, and the plastic version of the riverboard was born. Sometime in the 1980s, Robert Carlson began running rivers in California, U.S.A. using an ocean bodyboard. Soon after he modified this design to be thicker, longer, with four handles. Later in 1986, Ged Hay began taking his body board down the Kawarau River near Queenstown while on his days off as a rafting guide.

European riders also developed a foam version (called a hydrospeed) of the plastic board to reduce weight and avoid injuring each other during collisions that sometimes resulted from one rider travelling downstream and another facing upstream while surfing a hydraulic. Today, homemade foam hydrospeeds are found primarily among European riders. A growing sport in North America, riverboarding has grown in popularity from media exposure and the emergence of commercial operators running riverboard trips.

== Equipment ==

Riverboarders typically wear fins to provide the thrust to navigate in river currents, while a personal flotation device provides additional buoyancy. Wetsuits, booties and helmets are worn as protection from the cold and from rocks. Additionally, shin guards, gloves, knee pads, thigh pads, and elbow pads are sometimes worn for extra protection on shallow rivers. Instruction, board design, and gear continue to improve, making riverboarding safer and opening up the possibilities of rapids that can be run on a riverboard and new tricks that can be performed while surfing on the belly.

== Rescue use ==
In rescue use, the board is used to support both rescuer and victim in the water during rescue. The rider must engage both mind and body—thinking about the best way to go down a river while using their fins for the propulsion to get out of harm&#x27;s way. Riverboards can offer rescuers a valuable chase option to access victims swept downstream who may not be accessed by hand or rope.

== Rivers ==
Several companies operate riverboarding or sledging excursions in New Zealand near Queenstown, Wānaka, and Rotorua. Several companies also operate guided riverboard trips in the United States near Missoula, Montana; Sacramento, California; Bend, Oregon, and eastern Tennessee. In South America, river boarding is popular on the Rio Fonce in San Gil, Colombia. One company based in Voss, Norway, offers riverboarding in several rivers in the area. In Europe the Soca river in Slovenia is a notable location with more extreme options available for more experienced riders.
In Canada, the Lachine rapids, on the Saint-Lawrence river near Montreal, boarding is also offered.
A commercial riverboarding operation commenced on the Tully River in Queensland, Australia, in 2014.

== Records ==
Mike McVey currently holds the record for the tallest waterfall riverboarded with his descent of the 31-meter (101 ft) tall Metlako falls on Eagle Creek in Oregon.
Mike Horn previously held the record for the tallest waterfall riverboarded with his descent of a 22-meter (72 ft) tall waterfall on the upper reaches of the Pacuare River at Costa Rica.

<text>Bribery is the corrupt solicitation, payment, or acceptance of a private favor (a bribe) in exchange for official action. The purpose of a bribe is to influence the actions of the recipient, a person charge of an official duty, to act contrary to their duty and the known rules of honesty and integrity.

Gifts of money or other items of value that are otherwise available to everyone on an equivalent basis, and not for dishonest purposes, are not bribery. Offering a discount or a refund to all purchasers is a legal rebate and is not bribery. For example, it is legal for an employee of a Public Utilities Commission involved in electric rate regulation to accept a rebate on electric service that reduces their cost of electricity, when the rebate is available to other residential electric customers; however, giving a discount specifically to that employee to influence them to look favorably on the electric utility&#x27;s rate increase applications would be considered bribery.

A bribe is an illegal or unethical gift or lobbying effort bestowed to influence the recipient&#x27;s conduct. It may be money, goods, rights in action, property, preferment, privilege, emolument, objects of value, advantage, or merely a promise to induce or influence the action, vote, or influence of a person in an official or public capacity. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 has a target to substantially reduce corruption and bribery of all forms as part of an international effort aimed at ensuring peace, justice, and strong institutions.

Society often goes through changes that bring long-lasting positive or negative complications. Similar has been the case with bribery, which brought negative changes to societal norms as well as to trade. The researchers found that when bribery becomes part of social norms, one approach is not enough to tackle bribery due to the existence of different societies in different countries. If severe punishment works in one country, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that severe punishment would work in another country to prevent bribery. Also, the research found that bribery plays a significant role in public and private firms around the world.

== Forms ==

Many types of payments or favors may be fairly or unfairly labeled as bribes: tip, gift, sop, perk, skim, favor, discount, waived fee/ticket, free food, free ad, free trip, free tickets, sweetheart deal, kickback/payback, funding, inflated sale of an object or property, lucrative contract, donation, campaign contribution, fundraiser, sponsorship/backing, higher paying job, stock options, secret commission, or promotion (rise of position/rank).

One must be careful of differing social and cultural norms when examining bribery. Expectations of when a monetary transaction is appropriate can differ from place to place. Political campaign contributions in the form of cash, for example, are considered criminal acts of bribery in some countries, while in the United States, provided they adhere to election law, are legal. Tipping, for example, is considered bribery in some societies, while in others the two concepts may not be interchangeable.

In some Spanish-speaking countries, bribes are referred to as &quot;mordida&quot; (literally, &quot;bite&quot;). In Arab countries, bribes may be called baksheesh (a tip, gift, or gratuity) or &quot;shay&quot; (literally, &quot;tea&quot;). French-speaking countries often use the expressions &quot;dessous-de-table&quot; (&quot;under-the-table&quot; commissions), &quot;pot-de-vin&quot; (literally, &quot;wine-pot&quot;), or &quot;commission occulte&quot; (&quot;secret commission&quot; or &quot;kickback&quot;). While the last two expressions contain inherently a negative connotation, the expression &quot;dessous-de-table&quot; can be often understood as a commonly accepted business practice. In German, the common term is &quot;Schmiergeld&quot; (&quot;smoothing money&quot;).

The offence may be divided into two great classes: the one, where a person invested with power is induced by payment to use it unjustly; the other, where power is obtained by purchasing the suffrages of those who can impart it. Likewise, the briber might hold a powerful role and control the transaction; or in other cases, a bribe may be effectively extracted from the person paying it, although this is better known as extortion.

The forms that bribery take are numerous. For example, a motorist might bribe a police officer not to issue a ticket for speeding, a citizen seeking paperwork or utility line connections might bribe a functionary for faster service. Bribery may also take the form of a secret commission, a profit made by an agent, in the course of his employment, without the knowledge of his principal. Euphemisms abound for this (commission, sweetener, kick-back etc.) Bribers and recipients of bribery are likewise numerous although bribers have one common denominator and that is the financial ability to bribe. In 2007, bribery was thought to be worth around one trillion dollars worldwide.

As indicated on the pages devoted to political corruption, efforts have been made in recent years by the international community to encourage countries to dissociate and incriminate as separate offences, active and passive bribery. From a legal point of view, active bribery can be defined for instance as &quot;the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage [to any public official], for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions.&quot; (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173) of the Council of Europe). Passive bribery can be defined as &quot;the request or receipt [by any public official], directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions&quot; (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).

The reason for this dissociation is to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal policy point of view) that bribery is not acceptable. Besides, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. Besides, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a &quot;fee&quot; to the decision maker to obtain a favourable decision.

When examining the fact of bribe taking, we primarily need to understand that any action is affected by various elements; in addition, all these elements are interrelated. For instance, it would be wrong to indicate that the bribe-taker&#x27;s motive is greediness as such, without examining causes of appearance of greediness in the personality of the particular bribe-taker. Largely, it is possible to confine oneself to the motive of greediness only in case if a bribe-taker tries to satisfy the primary (physical) needs. Yet, if money serves to satisfy secondary – psychological – needs, we should search for deeper motives of bribe taking.

==Government==
A grey area may exist when payments to smooth transactions are made. United States law is particularly strict in limiting the ability of businesses to pay for the awarding of contracts by foreign governments; however, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act contains an exception for &quot;grease payments&quot;; very basically, this allows payments to officials in order to obtain the performance of ministerial acts which they are legally required to do, but may delay in the absence of such payment. In some countries, this practice is the norm, often resulting from a developing nation not having the tax structure to pay civil servants an adequate salary. Nevertheless, most economists regard bribery as a bad thing because it encourages rent seeking behaviour. A state where bribery has become a way of life is a kleptocracy.

Recent evidence suggests that the act of bribery can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country, region and/or tribal unit.

===Tax treatment===
The tax status of bribes is an issue for governments since the bribery of government officials impedes the democratic process and may interfere with good government. In some countries, such bribes are considered tax-deductible payments. However, in 1996, in an effort to discourage bribery, the OECD Council recommended that member countries cease to allow the tax-deductibility of bribes to foreign officials. This was followed by the signing of the Anti-Bribery Convention. Since that time, the majority of the OECD countries which are signatories of the convention have revised their tax policies according to this recommendation and some have extended the measures to bribes paid to any official, sending the message that bribery will no longer be tolerated in the operations of the government.

As any monetary benefit received from an illegal activity such as bribery is generally considered part of one&#x27;s taxable income, however, as it is criminal, some governments may refuse to accept it as income as it may mean they are a party to the activity.

== Trade ==
According to researchers, bribery has a major impact on a country&#x27;s trade system. The key findings suggest two possible outcomes when bribery becomes part of country&#x27;s export system. First, when firms and government officials are involved in bribery in the home country, the home country&#x27;s export increases because incentives are gained through bribery. Second, the home country&#x27;s import decreases, because domestic firms lose interest in foreign markets, and minimize their import from other countries. Also, in another study, it was found that firms are willing to risk paying higher bribes if the returns are high, even if it involves &quot;risk and consequences of detection and punishment&quot;. Additionally, other findings show that, in comparison to public firms, private firms pay most bribes abroad.

==Medicine==
Pharmaceutical corporations may seek to entice doctors to favor prescribing their drugs over others of comparable effectiveness. If the medicine is prescribed heavily, they may seek to reward the individual through gifts. The American Medical Association has published ethical guidelines for gifts from industry which include the tenet that physicians should not accept gifts if they are given in relation to the physician&#x27;s prescribing practices.

Doubtful cases include grants for traveling to medical conventions that double as tourist trips. Dentists often receive samples of home dental care products such as toothpaste, which are of negligible value; dentists in a television commercial would often state that they get these samples but pay to use the sponsor&#x27;s product. In countries offering state-subsidized or nationally funded healthcare where medical professionals are underpaid, patients may use bribery to solicit the standard expected level of medical care. For example, in many formerly Communist countries from what used to be the Eastern Bloc it may be customary to offer expensive gifts to doctors and nurses for the delivery of service at any level of medical care in the non-private health sector.

==Politics==
Politicians receive campaign contributions and other payoffs from powerful corporations, organizations or individuals in return for making choices in the interests of those parties, or in anticipation of favorable policy, also referred to as lobbying. This is not illegal in the United States and forms a major part of campaign finance, though it is sometimes referred to as the money loop; however, in many European countries, a politician accepting money from a corporation whose activities fall under the sector they currently (or are campaigning to be elected to) regulate would be considered a criminal offence, for instance the &quot;Cash-for-questions affair&quot; and &quot;Cash for Honours&quot; in the United Kingdom.

A grey area in these democracies is the so-called &quot;revolving door&quot; in which politicians are offered highly-paid, often consultancy jobs upon their retirement from politics by the corporations they regulate while in office, in return for enacting legislation favourable to the corporation while they are in office, a conflict of interest. Convictions for this form of bribery are easier to obtain with hard evidence, a specific amount of money linked to a specific action by the recipient of the bribe. Such evidence is frequently obtained using undercover agents, since evidence of a quid pro quo relation can often be difficult to prove (influence peddling and political corruption).

Recent evidence suggests that demands for bribes can adversely impact citizen level of trust and engagement with the political process.

==Business==

Employees, managers, or salespeople of a business may offer money or gifts to a potential client in exchange for business. For example, in 2006, German prosecutors conducted a wide-ranging investigation of Siemens AG to determine if Siemens employees paid bribes in exchange for business.

In some cases where the system of law is not well-implemented, bribes may be a way for companies to continue their businesses. In the case, for example, custom officials may harass a certain firm or production plant, officially stating they are checking for irregularities, halting production or stalling other normal activities of a firm. The disruption may cause losses to the firm that exceed the amount of money to pay off the official. Bribing the officials is a common way to deal with this issue in countries where there exists no firm system of reporting these semi-illegal activities. A third party, known as a &quot;white glove&quot;, may be involved to act as a clean middleman. Specialist consultancies have been set up to help multinational companies and small and medium enterprises with a commitment to anti-corruption to trade more ethically and benefit from compliance with the law. Contracts based on or involving the payment or transfer of bribes (&quot;corruption money&quot;, &quot;secret commissions&quot;, &quot;pots-de-vin&quot;, &quot;kickbacks&quot;) are void.

In 2012, &quot;The Economist&quot; noted:

In addition, a survey conducted by auditing firm Ernst &amp; Young in 2012 found that 15 percent of top financial executives are willing to pay bribes in order to keep or win business. Another 4 percent said they would be willing to misstate financial performance. This alarming indifference represents a huge risk to their business, given their responsibility.

==Sport corruption==
Referees and scoring judges may be offered money, gifts, or other compensation to guarantee a specific outcome in an athletic or other sports competition. A well-known example of this manner of bribery in the sport would be the 2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal, where the French judge in the pairs competition voted for the Russian skaters in order to secure an advantage for the French skaters in the ice dancing competition. Additionally, bribes may be offered by cities in order to secure athletic franchises, or even competitions, as happened with the 2002 Winter Olympics. It is common practice for cities to &quot;bid&quot; against each other with stadiums, tax benefits, and licensing deals.

==Prevention==
The research suggests that government should introduce training programs for public officials to help public officials from falling into the trap of bribery. Also, anti-bribery programs should be integrated into education programs. In addition, government should promote good culture in public and private sectors. There should be &quot;clear code of conducts and strong internal control systems&quot; which would improve the overall public and private system. Furthermore, the research suggests that private and public sectors at home and abroad must work together to limit corruption in home firms and foreign firms. There will be greater transparency and less chances of bribery. Alongside, cross border monitoring should be enhanced to minimize bribery on international level.

===Legislation===
The U.S. introduced the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in 1977 to address bribery of foreign officials. FCPA criminalized the influencing of foreign officials by companies through rewards or payments. This legislation dominated international anti-corruption enforcement until around 2010 when other countries began introducing broader and more robust legislation, notably the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010. The International Organization for Standardization introduced an international anti-bribery management system standard in 2016. In recent years, cooperation in enforcement action between countries has increased.

Under 18 U.S. Code § 201 – Bribery of public officials and witnesses, the law strictly prohibits any type of promising, giving, or offering of value to a public official. A public official is further defined as anyone who holds public or elected office. Another stipulation of the law in place condemns the same kind of offering, giving, or coercing a witness in a legal case to changing their story. Under the U.S Code § 1503, influencing or injuring officer or juror generally, it clearly states that any offense under the section means you can be imprisoned for the maximum of 10 years and/or fined.

===Businesses===
Programs of prevention need to be properly designed and meet with international standards of best practice. To ensure respect for a program, whether it be on the part of employees or business partners, external verification is necessary. International best practices such as the Council for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, Annex 2; the ISO 26000 norm (section 6.6.3) or TI Business Principles for Countering Bribery are used in external verification processes to measure and ensure that a program of bribery prevention works and is consistent with international standards. Another reason for businesses to undergo external verification of their bribery prevention programs is that it means evidence can be provided to assert that all that was possible was done to prevent corruption. Companies are unable to guarantee corruption has never occurred; what they can do is provide evidence that they did their best to prevent it.

There is no federal statute under the U.S Law that prohibits or regulates any type of private or commercial bribery. There is a way for prosecutors to try people for bribery by using existing laws. Section 1346 of Title 18 can be used by prosecutors, to try people for &#x27;a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right to honest services,&#x27; under the mail and wire fraud statutes. Prosecutors have always successfully prosecuted private company employees for breaching a fiduciary duty and taking bribes, under Honest services fraud.

There are also cases of successful prosecution of bribery in the case of international business. The DOJ has used the Travel Act, 18 USC Section 1952 to prosecute bribery. Under the Travel Act, it is against the law, domestically and internationally, to utilize&#x27;the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce&#x27; with intent to &#x27;promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment or carrying on, of any unlawful activity&#x27;.

== Bribery in different countries ==
The research conducted in Papua New Guinea reflects cultural norms as the key reason for corruption. Bribery is a pervasive way of carrying out public services in PNG. Papuans don&#x27;t consider bribery as an illegal act, they considered bribery as a way of earning &quot;quick money and sustain living&quot;. Moreover, the key findings reflect that when corruption becomes a cultural norm, illegal acts such as bribery are not viewed as bad, and the clear boundaries that once distinguished between legal and illegal acts, and decisions are minimized on opinion, rather than on a code of conduct.

The research conducted in Russia reflects that &quot;bribery is a marginal social phenomenon&quot; in the view of professional jurists and state employees. The Russian law recognizes bribery as an official crime. Consequently, legal platforms such as public courts are the only place where anti-bribery steps are taken in the country. However, in reality, bribery cannot be addressed only by the &quot;law-enforcement agencies and the courts&quot;. Bribery needs to be addressed by informal social norms that set cultural values for the society. Also, the research suggests that the severity of punishment for bribery does very little to prevent people from accepting bribes in Russia. Moreover, the research also revealed that a large number of Russians, approximately 70% to 77% have never given a bribe. Nevertheless, if a need arises to pay a bribe for a problem, the research found that an overwhelming majority of Russians knew both what the sum of the bribe should be and how to deliver the bribe. The Russian bribe problem reflects that unless there is an active change in all parts of society among both young and old, bribery will remain a major problem in Russian society, even when government officials label it as &quot;marginal social phenomenon&quot;.

For comparison amongst countries, Transparency International used to publish the Bribe Payers Index, but stopped in 2011. Spokesperson Shubham Kaushik said the organisation &quot;decided to discontinue the survey due to funding issues and to focus on issues that are more in line with our advocacy goals&quot;.

===Statistics===

Following are the rates of reported bribery per 100,000 persons in last available year according to the United Nations. Comparisons between countries are difficult due to large differences in the fraction of unreported bribes.

<doc id="260982" wikidata="Q5540784" url="?curid=260982" title="George Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe">
<text>George Augustus Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe (c. 1725 – 6 July 1758) was a career officer and a brigadier general in the British Army. He was described by James Wolfe as &quot;the best officer in the British Army&quot;. He was killed in the French and Indian War in a skirmish at Fort Ticonderoga the day before the Battle of Carillon, an ultimately disastrous attempt by the British to capture French-controlled Fort Carillon.

==Background==
Howe&#x27;s father was Emanuel Scrope Howe, 2nd Viscount Howe, and mother was Mary Sophia von Kielmansegg (a niece of King George I), and he had two notable younger brothers, Richard Howe, Earl Howe and William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe, as well as seven other siblings. George was born either on the Howe estate at Langar, Nottinghamshire, or at the Howe home on Albemarle Street, London.

==Early career==
Howe joined the army as an ensign of the 1st Foot Guards in 1745 and saw service during the Flanders campaign of the War of the Austrian Succession. In 1746 he was made an aide-de-camp to the Duke of Cumberland who led the Allied Army in Flanders. In 1747 Howe fought at the Battle of Laufeld. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1749 following the end of the war.

==Ticonderoga campaign reforms==

In 1758, in preparation for the attack on the French fort at Ticonderoga, which controlled access from Lake George to Lake Champlain, Lord Howe set about reforming General James Abercrombie&#x27;s army for warfare in North America. He used his own 55th Regiment as an example for the rest of the army to follow. Howe had uniforms cut short, so that they came just to the men&#x27;s waists, and all lace was removed from the coats as well. The cumbersome tricorn hats worn by the soldiers were cut down to brims of , resembling derby hats. Infantrymen were issued leggings made of wool, in place of their linen and hemp canvas gaiters. Excess uniforms and equipment were done away with. The men&#x27;s hair was cut short, Dr. Richard Huck wrote; &quot;we are an army of round heads.&quot; Officers were not immune to his changes either, and he made himself an example of this, cutting his hair short. He washed his own clothes, and took very little baggage into the field.

His changes did not only affect the uniforms of the army but its tactics as well. In the fall of 1757, Lord Howe had accompanied the famous ranger Major Robert Rogers on a scouting expedition. In the spring he again met with Rogers to discuss warfare and tactics in the North American theater. He began instructing the troops in Abercrombie&#x27;s army in the manner of marching, forming, and fighting in the woods. One observer stated that Lord Howe had trained his 55th Regiment so well that they were as &quot;dexterious as rangers.&quot;

Many historians have credited Lord Howe with the creation of light infantry, and have called the 55th Regiment a light infantry regiment, however that was not the case. While Lord Loudoun contemplated creating light infantry companies in each redcoat battalion, the idea was scrapped when Colonel Thomas Gage proposed to raise a regiment of Light Armed Foot, that became Gage&#x27;s 80th Regiment. They wore brown uniforms, instead of red and were the first British light infantry regiment. At the Siege of Louisbourg, General Jeffery Amherst ordered his regiments to create light infantry companies. Those companies were then placed into a light infantry battalion under the command of Colonel George Scott of the 40th Regiment. The following year, as Commander-in-chief in North America, Amherst ordered each regiment in North America to create a light infantry company.

==Seven Years War==
On 2 February 1757, Howe was appointed colonel, 3rd Battalion of the 60th Foot (the Royal Americans, later the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps), but transferred to command the 55th Regiment of Foot on 28 September 1757 while at Halifax. In December he was promoted to Brigadier General.

In 1758 he and the regiment were part of General James Abercrombie&#x27;s failed attack, the Battle of Carillon at Fort Ticonderoga. England&#x27;s Prime Minister William Pitt had wanted Howe in command of this expedition rather than Abercrombie, but Abercrombie had more political contacts and seniority, so Howe was made second-in-command. On 6 July Abercrombie&#x27;s force marched north from the shore of Lake George in four columns. Howe led one of these columns, with the 55th regiment accompanied by a unit of Connecticut militia, with Major Israel Putnam as a scout and guide. They made contact with a French detachment that had been separated from the main force and a sharp skirmish ensued. They fought well, taking 148 prisoners, and causing an estimated 300 enemy casualties with limited losses to their own number. But one of those casualties was General Howe, who died in Putnam&#x27;s arms.

==Aftermath==

Howe was widely mourned on both sides of the Atlantic. The Massachusetts Assembly (or general court) later voted £250 to place a monument in Westminster Abbey by the sculptor Peter Scheemakers, which was erected in 1759.

==Genealogy==
George Augustus was brother to Admiral Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, 4th Viscount and Sir William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe. &quot;The Family of Hoge&quot; quotes &quot;The Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as having this to say about the Howes:
The friendliness of the brothers, Admiral Richard Howe and General William Howe, to the colonies led to their selection for the command of the British forces in the Revolutionary War. It was thought that they could negotiate a settlement with the American forces.

<text>Międzyzdroje (; ), historically known as Misdroy in English, is a city and a seaside resort in northwestern Poland on the island of Wolin on the Baltic coast. The city is located in the West Pomeranian Voivodeship, and is a seat of the Kamień County and the municipality of Międzyzdroje. In 2016, it was inhabited by around 5,500 people.

The town is often referred to as &quot;The Pearl of the Baltic&quot;. It is situated between wide sandy beaches with high cliffs and the forests of the Woliński National Park (which includes a bison reserve). Międzyzdroje has a spa climate and is rich in tourist services.

==History==

The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under its first ruler Mieszko I around 967. Following the fragmentation of Poland, it formed part of the Duchy of Pomerania. Towards the very end of the 12th century two settled camps or settlements have been established within the present-day town limits. Both of these settlements, with a mining and agricultural focus, were property of the Bishopric of Kamien Pomorski. The first initial name of the town appeared in the 15th century as &quot;Misdroige&quot;. According to sources, the early Slavic and Germanic settlers were involved primarily in agriculture, cattle-breeding, fishing, bee-keeping and hunting.

The entire island of Wolin, including Międzyzdroje, was captured by the Swedish Empire in 1630 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Sweden ceded control of the island to Prussia in the 1720 Treaties of Stockholm. A particularly noticeable increase in the number of inhabitants, mostly local but also foreign, was recorded throughout the 18th century. During this time, the village began to evolve into a luxurious spa resort as a result of strong English influence in the development of sea baths.

In the first half of the industrial 19th century, Europeans of different backgrounds began to visit Misdroy and appreciate its baths, health clinics and favourable climate. With the arrival of tourists and the development of the tourist sector in the area, the once small, insignificant fishing village rapidly transformed into a popular health resort. In 1835, the gender-segregated baths were constructed by English and German merchants and entrepreneurs. Wealthy industrialists and business magnates from Stettin (Szczecin), Berlin and London would erect their magnificent and extravagant villas along the Baltic shore.

One of the earliest public parks was created in 1860 as an initiative of a wealthy Belgian merchant named Arnold Lejeune. A wooden pier on the Baltic Sea was constructed and eventually upgraded in 1906. The pier was 360 metres in length and the coffee-house situated at its very end still operates to this day.

In 1899, Misdroy was connected via railway with nearby Szczecin (Stettin) and Świnoujście, which contributed to an even greater number of patient and tourist arrivals. Shortly before the outbreak of World War I, over 20,000 visitors were recorded, an astonishing and record-breaking number in that period.

Prior to World War II, the town had around 4,000 permanent residents. During World War II, in February 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the settlement. The town did not suffer destruction during the course of the war. After the war, the Międzyzdroje became part of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic in 1945 in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and was granted town status.

The town&#x27;s Polish name comes from its original 16th century meaning of the &quot;town between salts springs&quot;, or Międzyzdroje in Polish.

In 1959, town limits were expanded.

<text>East Africa, also known as Eastern Africa or the East of Africa, is a region at the eastern edge of the African continent, distinguished by its geographical, historical, and cultural landscape. Defined in varying scopes, the region is recognized in the United Nations Statistics Division scheme as encompassing 18 sovereign states and 4 territories. It includes the Horn of Africa to the North and Southeastern Africa to the south.

== Definitions ==
In a narrow sense, particularly in English-speaking contexts, East Africa refers to the area comprising Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, largely due to their shared history under the Omani Empire and as parts of the British East Africa Protectorate and German East Africa. Further extending East Africa&#x27;s definition, the Horn of Africa—comprising Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia—stands out as a distinct geopolitical entity within East Africa.

The East African Community, an economic and political bloc, currently includes the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Somalia, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania. Notably, the African Great Lakes region overlaps significantly with these countries.

Inside of Somalia there are two unrecognised states; Somaliland and Puntland, although Puntland still wants to join back with Somalia, for now it is independent. Adjacent to these mainland territories are island nations and territories such as Socotra, Comoros, Mauritius, Seychelles, Réunion, Mayotte, and the Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean.

Regions including portions of Mozambique and Madagascar, often aligned with Southern Africa, share significant historical and cultural connections with East Africa, particularly through the Indian Ocean&#x27;s maritime networks. Sudan is also sometimes included due in part because it is a member of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) free trade area. 

==History==

===Prehistory===

According to the theory of the recent African origin of modern humans, the predominantly held belief among most archaeologists, East Africa in the area of the African Great Lakes is where anatomically modern humans first appeared. There are differing theories on whether there was a single exodus or several; a multiple dispersal model involves the Southern Dispersal theory. Some researchers have suggested that North Africa was the region of Africa from which modern humans who first trekked out of the continent.

According to both genetic and fossil evidence, it has been posited that archaic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; evolved into anatomically modern humans in the Horn of Africa around 200,000 years ago and dispersed from there. The recognition of &quot;Homo sapiens idaltu&quot; and Omo Kibish as anatomically modern humans would justify the description of contemporary humans with the subspecies name &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;. Because of their early dating and unique physical characteristics &quot;idaltu&quot; and kibish represent the immediate ancestors of anatomically modern humans as suggested by the Out-of-Africa theory.

In 2017 finds of modern human remains, dating to ca 300,000 years ago in Jebel Irhoud in Morocco, suggested that modern humans arose earlier and possibly in a larger area of Africa than previously thought.

East Africa is one of the earliest regions where &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; are believed to have lived. Evidence was found in 2018, dating to about 320,000 years ago, at the Kenyan site of Olorgesailie, of the early emergence of modern behaviors associated with &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, including: long-distance trade networks (involving goods such as obsidian), the use of pigments, and the possible making of projectile points. It is observed by the authors of three 2018 studies on the site, that the evidence of these behaviors is approximately contemporary to the earliest known &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossil remains from Africa (such as at Jebel Irhoud and Florisbad), and they suggest that complex and modern behaviors had already begun in Africa around the time of the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

In September 2019, scientists reported the computerized determination, based on 260 CT scans, of a virtual skull shape of the last common human ancestor to modern humans/&quot;H. sapiens&quot;, representative of the earliest &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, and suggested that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; arose between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago through a merging of populations in South and East Africa.

The migration route of the &quot;Out of Africa&quot; theory probably occurred in East Africa through the Bab-el-Mandeb. Today at the Bab-el-Mandeb straits, the Red Sea is about wide, but 50,000 years ago it was much narrower and sea levels were 70 meters lower. Though the straits were never completely closed, there may have been islands in between which could be reached using simple rafts.

Some of the earliest hominin skeletal remains have been found in the wider region, including fossils discovered in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia, as well as in the Koobi Fora in Kenya and Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania.

The southern part of East Africa was occupied until recent times by Khoisan hunter-gatherers, whereas in the Ethiopian Highlands the donkey and such crop plants as teff allowed the beginning of agriculture around 7,000 BCE. Lowland barriers and diseases carried by the tsetse fly, however, prevented the donkey and agriculture from spreading southwards. Only in quite recent times has agriculture spread to the more humid regions south of the equator, through the spread of cattle, sheep and crops such as millet. Language distributions suggest that this most likely occurred from Sudan into the African Great Lakes region, since the Nilotic languages spoken by these pre-Bantu farmers have their closest relatives in the middle Nile basin.

===Ancient history===
Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and the Red Sea coast of Sudan are considered the most likely location of the land known to the Ancient Egyptians as &quot;Punt&quot;. The old kingdom&#x27;s first mention dates to the 25th century BCE. The ancient Puntites were a nation of people that had close relations with Pharaonic Egypt during the times of Pharaoh Sahure and Queen Hatshepsut.

The Kingdom of Aksum was a trading empire centered Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. It existed from approximately 100–940 CE, growing from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period to achieve prominence by the 1st century CE. The kingdom is mentioned in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; as an important marketplace for ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world. Aksum was at the time ruled by Zoskales, who also governed the port of Adulis. The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own Aksumite currency. The state also established its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush.

====Bantu expansion====

Between 2500 and 3000 years ago, Bantu-speaking peoples began a millennia-long series of migrations eastward from their homeland around southern Cameroon. This Bantu expansion introduced agriculture into much of the African Great Lakes region. During the following fifteen centuries, the Bantu slowly intensified farming and grazing over all suitable regions of East Africa, in the process making contact with Austronesian- and Arabic-speaking settlers on southern coastal areas. The latter also spread Islam to the coastal belt, but most Bantu remained African Traditional Religion adherents.

Over a period of many centuries, most hunting-foraging peoples were displaced and absorbed by incoming Bantu communities, as well as by later Nilotic communities. The Bantu expansion was a long series of physical migrations, a diffusion of language and knowledge out into and in from neighboring populations, and a creation of new societal groups involving inter-marriage among communities and small groups moving to communities and small groups moving to new areas.

After their movements from their original homeland in West Africa, Bantus also encountered in central east Africa peoples of Cushitic origin. As cattle terminology in use amongst the few modern Bantu pastoralist groups suggests, the Bantu migrants would acquire cattle from their new Cushitic neighbors. Linguistic evidence also indicates that Bantus most likely borrowed the custom of milking cattle directly from Cushitic peoples in the area.

On the coastal section of the African Great Lakes region, another mixed Bantu community developed through contact with Muslim Arab and Persian traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African Swahili City States. The Swahili culture that emerged from these exchanges evinces many Arab and Islamic influences not seen in traditional Bantu culture, as do the many Afro-Arab members of the Bantu Swahili people. With its original speech community centered on the coastal parts of Tanzania (particularly Zanzibar) and Kenya—a seaboard referred to as the Swahili Coast—the Bantu Swahili language contains many Arabic loan-words as a consequence of these interactions. Its important to note that Kiswahili grammar and structure are purely African and Bantu even if its vocabulary has non-African influence in the same way English remains a Germanic language regardless of its vocabulary being heavily influenced by Latin and French among other languages.

The earliest Bantu inhabitants of the east coast of Kenya and Tanzania encountered by these later Arab and Persian settlers have been variously identified with the trading settlements of Rhapta, Azania and Menouthias referenced in early Greek and Chinese writings from 50 CE to 500 CE, ultimately giving rise to the name for Tanzania. These early writings perhaps document the first wave of Bantu settlers to reach central east Africa during their migration.

Between the 14th and 15th centuries, large African Great Lakes kingdoms and states emerged, such as the Buganda and Karagwe kingdoms of Uganda and Tanzania.

===Modern history===

====Arab and Portuguese eras====
The Portuguese were the first Europeans to explore the region of current-day Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique by sea. Vasco da Gama visited Mombasa in 1498. Da Gama&#x27;s voyage was successful in reaching India, which permitted the Portuguese to trade with the Far East directly by sea. This in turn challenged the older trading networks of mixed land and sea routes, such as the spice trade routes which utilized the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and camel caravans to reach the eastern Mediterranean.

The Republic of Venice had gained control over much of the trade routes between Europe and Asia. After traditional land routes to India had been closed by the Ottoman Turks, Portugal hoped to use the sea route pioneered by da Gama to break the once Venetian trading monopoly. Portuguese rule in the African Great Lakes region focused mainly on a coastal strip centered around Mombasa. The Portuguese presence in the area officially began after 1505, when flagships under the command of Don Francisco de Almeida conquered Kilwa, an island located in what is now southern Tanzania.

In March 1505, having received from Manuel I of Portugal the appointment of viceroy of the newly conquered territory in India, he set sail from Lisbon in command of a large and powerful fleet, and arrived in July at Quiloa (Kilwa), which yielded to him almost without a struggle. A much more vigorous resistance was offered by the Moors of Mombasa. However, the town was taken and destroyed, and its large treasures went to strengthen the resources of Almeida. Attacks followed on Hoja (now known as Ungwana, located at the mouth of the Tana River), Barawa, Angoche, Pate and other coastal towns until the western Indian Ocean was a safe haven for Portuguese commercial interests. At other places on his way, such as the island of Angediva, near Goa, and Cannanore, the Portuguese built forts, and adopted measures to secure the Portuguese supremacy.

Portugal&#x27;s main goal on the Swahili coast was to take control of the spice trade from the Arabs. At this stage, the Portuguese presence in East Africa served the purposes of controlling trade within the Indian Ocean and securing the sea routes linking Europe to Asia. Portuguese naval vessels were very disruptive to the commerce of Portugal&#x27;s enemies within the western Indian Ocean and were able to demand high tariffs on items transported through the sea due to their strategic control of ports and shipping lanes. The construction of Fort Jesus in Mombasa in 1593 was meant to solidify Portuguese hegemony in the region, but their influence was clipped by the British, Dutch and Omani Arab incursions into the Great Lakes region during the 17th century.

The Omani Arabs posed the most direct challenge to Portuguese influence in the African Great Lakes region. By this time, the Portuguese Empire had already lost its interest on the spice trade sea route due to the decreasing profitability of that business. The Arabs reclaimed much of the Indian Ocean trade, forcing the Portuguese to retreat south where they remained in Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique) as sole rulers until the 1975 independence of Mozambique.

Omani Arab colonization of the Kenyan and Tanzanian coasts brought the once independent city-states under closer foreign scrutiny and domination than was experienced during the Portuguese period. Like their predecessors, the Omani Arabs were primarily able only to control the coastal areas, not the interior. However, the creation of clove plantations, intensification of the slave trade and relocation of the Omani capital to Zanzibar in 1839 by Seyyid Said had the effect of consolidating the Omani power in the region.

Arab governance of all the major ports along the Swahili coast continued until British interests aimed particularly at ending the slave trade and creation of a wage-labour system began to put pressure on Omani rule. By the late nineteenth century, the slave trade on the open seas had been completely outlawed by the British and the Omani Arabs had little ability to resist the British navy&#x27;s ability to enforce the directive. The Omani presence continued in Zanzibar and Pemba until the Zanzibar Revolution in 1964. However, the official Omani Arab presence in Kenya was checked by German and British seizure of key ports and creation of crucial trade alliances with influential local leaders in the 1880s.

====Period of European imperialism====

Between the 19th and 20th century, East Africa became a theatre of competition between the major imperialistic European nations of the time. The three main colors of the African country were beige, red, and blue. The red stood for the English, blue stood for the French, and the beige stood for Germany during the period of colonialism. During the period of the Scramble for Africa, almost every country in the larger region to varying degrees became part of a European colonial empire.

Portugal had first established a strong presence in southern Mozambique and the Indian Ocean since the 15th century, while during this period their possessions increasingly grew including parts from the present northern Mozambique country, up to Mombasa in present-day Kenya. At Lake Malawi, they finally met the recently created British Protectorate of Nyasaland (nowadays Malawi), which surrounded the homonymous lake on three sides, leaving the Portuguese the control of lake&#x27;s eastern coast. The British Empire set foot in the region&#x27;s most exploitable and promising lands acquiring what is today Uganda, and Kenya. The Protectorate of Uganda and the Colony of Kenya were located in a rich farmland area mostly appropriate for the cultivation of cash crops like coffee and tea, as well as for animal husbandry with products produced from cattle and goats, such as goat meat, beef and milk. Moreover, this area had the potential for a significant residential expansion, being suitable for the relocation of a large number of British nationals to the region. Prevailing climatic conditions and the regions&#x27; geomorphology allowed the establishment of flourishing European-style settlements like Nairobi, Vila Pery, Vila Junqueiro, Porto Amélia, Lourenço Marques and Entebbe.

The French settled the largest island of the Indian Ocean (and the fourth-largest globally), Madagascar, along with a group of smaller islands nearby, namely Réunion and the Comoros. Madagascar became part of the French colonial empire following two military campaigns against the Kingdom of Madagascar, which it initiated after persuading Britain to relinquish its interests in the island in exchange for control of Zanzibar off the coast of Tanganyika, an important island hub of the spices trade. The British also held a number of island colonies in the region, including the extended archipelago of Seychelles and the rich farming island of Mauritius, previously under the French sovereignty.

The German Empire gained control of a large area named German East Africa, comprising present-day Rwanda, Burundi and the mainland part of Tanzania named Tanganyika. In 1922, the British gained a League of Nations mandate over Tanganyika which it administered until Independence was granted to Tanganyika in 1961. Following the Zanzibar Revolution of 1965, the independent state of Tanganyika formed the United Republic of Tanzania by creating a union between the mainland, and the island chain of Zanzibar. Zanzibar is now a semi-autonomous state in a union with the mainland which is collectively and commonly referred to as Tanzania. German East Africa, though very extensive, was not of such strategic importance as the British Crown&#x27;s colonies to the north: the inhabitation of these lands was difficult and thus limited, mainly due to climatic conditions and the local geomorphology. Italy gained control of various parts of Somalia in the 1880s. The southern three-fourths of Somalia became an Italian protectorate (Italian Somaliland).

Meanwhile, in 1884, a narrow coastal strip of Somaliland came under British control (British Somaliland). This Somaliland protectorate was just opposite the British colony of Aden on the Arabian Peninsula. With these territories secured, Britain was able to serve as gatekeeper of the sea lane leading to British India. In 1890, beginning with the purchase of the small port town of Asseb from a local sultan in Eritrea, the Italians colonized all of Eritrea.

In 1895, from bases in Somalia and Eritrea, the Italians launched the First Italo–Ethiopian War against the Orthodox Empire of Ethiopia. By 1896, the war had become a total disaster for the Italians and Ethiopia was able to retain its independence. Ethiopia remained independent until 1936 when, after the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, it became part of Italian East Africa. The Italian occupation of Ethiopia ended in 1941 during World War II as part of the East African Campaign. The French also staked out an East African outpost on the route to French Indochina. Starting in the 1850s, the small protectorate of Djibouti became French Somaliland in 1897.

====Post-colonial period====


====Conflicts====
Since the end of colonialism, several East African countries have been riven with military coups, ethnic violence and oppressive dictators. The region has endured the following post-colonial conflicts:

; Northern East Africa:(Horn of Africa)
* Ethiopian Civil War 1974–1991
* Eritrean War of Independence 1961–1991
* Eritrean-Ethiopian War 1998–2000
* Ogaden War 1977–1978
* Dijboutian Civil War 1991–1994
* Somali Civil War 1991–2009
* Tigray war 2020–2022
; Northern East Africa:(Sudan)
* First Sudanese Civil War
* Second Sudanese Civil War
* Sudanese nomadic conflicts
* War in Darfur
* War in Sudan 2023–present
; South Sudan
* Second Sudanese Civil War 1983–2005
* Internal Political-ethnic Conflict 2011–ongoing
* South Sudanese Civil War 2013–2015
; Southern East Africa (Southeast Africa)
* Burundian Civil War 1993–2005 and the genocide of Hutus in 1972 and the genocide of Tutsis in 1993
* Uganda–Tanzania War 1978–1979
* Ugandan Bush War 1981–1986
* Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army insurgency in Uganda, South Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo ongoing
* Rwandan Civil War 1990–1993 and the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi
* Zanzibar Revolution 1964
; Outside Southeast Africa with Southeast African participation
* First Congo War 1996–1997 and Second Congo War 1998–2003
* Kivu Conflict (Laurent Nkunda Rebellion)

Kenya has enjoyed relatively stable governance. However, its politics have been turbulent at times, including the attempted coup d&#x27;état in 1982 and the 2007 election riots.

Tanzania has known a stable government since independence although there are significant political and religious tensions resulting from the political union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar in 1964. Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous state in the United Republic of Tanzania.

Tanzania and Uganda fought the Uganda–Tanzania War in 1978–1979, which led to the removal of Uganda&#x27;s despotic leader Idi Amin.

Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda have each faced instability and ethnic conflict since independence, most notably, they experienced the 1994 Rwandan genocide and the 1993 Burundi genocide and the subsequent Burundian Civil War. Rwanda and Uganda continue to be involved in related conflicts outside the region.

Djibouti, as well as the Puntland and Somaliland regions of Somalia, have seen relative stability.

South Sudan peacefully seceded from Sudan in 2011, six and a half years after a peace agreement ended the Second Sudanese Civil War. South Sudanese independence was nearly derailed by the South Kordofan conflict, particularly, South Sudanese independence was nearly derailed by a dispute over the status of the Abyei Area, and Abyei and South Kordofan&#x27;s Nuba Hills both remained sources of tension between Juba and Khartoum .

== Geography==
Some parts of East Africa have been renowned for their concentrations of wild animals, such as the &quot;big five&quot;: the elephant, buffalo, lion, black rhinoceros, and leopard, though populations have been declining under increased stress in recent times, particularly those of the rhino and elephant.

The geography of East Africa is often stunning and scenic. Shaped by global plate tectonic forces that have created the East African Rift, East Africa is the site of Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, the two tallest peaks in Africa. It also includes the world&#x27;s second largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria, and the world&#x27;s second-deepest lake, Lake Tanganyika.

The unique geography and apparent suitability for farming made East Africa a target for European exploration, exploitation and colonialization in the nineteenth century. Today, tourism is an important part of the economies of Kenya, Tanzania, Seychelles, and Uganda. The easternmost point of the continent, that is Ras Hafun in Somalia, is of archaeological, historical and economical importance.

===Countries, capitals and largest cities===
According to the CIA, as of 2017, the countries in the eastern Africa region have a total population of around 537.9 million inhabitants.

===Climate===


East Africa has a diverse climate that consists of hot, dry desert regions, cooler regions, and highlands. Its climate generally is rather atypical of equatorial regions, being mostly arid or semi-arid with rainfall totals across much of the lowland regions below per year. In fact, on the northern coast of Somalia, annual rainfall is less than and many years can go by without any rain whatsoever. The causes of the low rainfall totals are not fully understood. One factor is presence of the Somali Jet (a fast wind system) in boreal summer, which brings cool southern hemisphere air into East Africa. A second cause is the presence of east to west river valleys in the East African Rift, which channel strong moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean away from East Africa and towards the Congo Basin rainforest.

Rainfall generally increases towards the south and with altitude, being around at Mogadishu and at Mombasa on the coast, whilst inland it increases from around at Garoowe to over at Moshi near Kilimanjaro. Rainfall in most of East Africa east of the Rwenzoris and Ethiopian Highlands is characterised by two main rainfall seasons, the long rains from March to May and the short rains from October to December. This is usually attributed to the passage of the Intertropical Convergence Zone across the region in those months, but it may also be analogous to the autumn monsoon rains of parts of Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and the Brazilian Nordeste. West of the mountains, the rainfall pattern is more typically tropical, with rain throughout the year near the equator and a single wet season in most of the Ethiopian Highlands from June to September — contracting to July and August around Asmara. Annual rainfall here ranges from over on the western slopes to around at Addis Ababa and at Asmara. In the high mountains rainfall can be over .

Rainfall variability is influenced by both El Niño events and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. El Niño events tend to increase rainfall except in the northern and western parts of the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands, where they produce drought and poor Nile floods. Similarly, a positive Indian Ocean Dipole result in warm sea-surface temperatures off the coast of East Africa and lead to increased rainfall over East Africa. Temperatures in East Africa, except on the hot and generally humid coastal belt, are moderate, with maxima of around and minima of at an altitude of . At altitudes of above , frosts are common during the dry season and maxima typically about or less.

==Demographics==
Eastern Africa had an estimated population of 260 million in 2000. This was projected to reach 890 million by 2050, with an average growth rate of 2.5% per annum. The 2000 population is expected to quintuple over the course of the 21st century, to 1.6 billion as of 2100 (UN estimates as of 2017). In Ethiopia, there is an estimated population of 102 million as of 2016.

===Languages===
In the Horn of Africa and Nile Valley, Afroasiatic languages predominate, including languages of the family&#x27;s Cushitic (such as Beja, Oromo and Somali), Semitic (such as Amharic, Arabic and Tigrinya), and Omotic (such as Wolaytta) branches.

In the African Great Lakes region, Niger-Congo languages of the Bantu branch are most widely spoken. Among these languages are Kikuyu, Luhya, Kinyarwanda, Kirundi, Kisukuma, Luganda and many others. Swahili, with at least 80 million speakers as a first or second language, is an important trade language in the Great Lakes area. It has official status in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda.

Nilotic languages, such as Luo, Kalenjin, Maasai and Nuer, are spoken in lesser numbers, primarily in the African Great Lakes and Nile Valley.

Indo-European languages, such as English, French, Portuguese and Italian, remain important in higher institutions in some parts of the larger region.

===Religion===

Christianity and Islam are the predominant religions of the region, with traditional African religions and religious syncretism being practiced too. Christianity is the majority religion of the countries in East Africa, with the exception of Comoros, Djibouti and Somalia, where Islam predominates, and Mauritius, where almost half of the population adheres to Hinduism. In Eritrea, the two major religions are Christianity and Islam, although the number of adherents of each faith is uncertain. Among the countries where Christianity is the largest religion, there are sizeable Muslim communities in Ethiopia, and on the Swahili coast in Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique. In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives found that the majority of Eastern Africa was Christian and mostly Protestant.

== Geology ==

=== Tectonic activity ===

The largest tectonic movement in East Africa is the East African Rift, both the Somali Plate and Nubian Plate are separating at 7mm per annum

== Popular depictions ==
There are movies that have depicted East Africa in various forms. &quot;7 Days in Entebbe&quot;, &quot;The Last King of Scotland&quot;, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, &quot;Queen of Katwe&quot;, &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;, &quot;The Good Lie&quot;, and &quot;Captain Phillips&quot; are a few of the critically acclaimed movies. In the video games &quot;Halo 2&quot; and &quot;Halo 3&quot;, East Africa is one of the central locations for the campaigns.
==Economy==
Agriculture plays a major role in the economy of East Africa, employing the majority of the population and contributing significantly to the GDP. Tourism is especially developed in Tanzania and Kenya, due to safari parks. Nairobi and Addis Ababa are the main financial hubs in East Africa.
While East Africa is the fastest growing region in Africa, several countries in the region are struggling economically, with their situation worsened by political instability, such as the economy of South Sudan which stagnated due to the South Sudanese Civil War.

<doc id="260989" wikidata="Q324805" url="?curid=260989" title="Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale">
<text>Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale, (17 February 1929 – 4 March 1993), was a British Conservative Party politician and government minister. 

As President of the Selsdon Group, a free-market lobby within the Conservative Party, he was closely aligned with Margaret Thatcher, and became one of her Ministers of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 1979. Responsible for the Falkland Islands, he tried to resolve the long-running sovereignty issue with Argentina, which detected Britain&#x27;s reluctance to defend the territory, and later invaded it.

As Secretary of State for Transport, Ridley performed a key function in building up coal stocks in advance of the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike, which helped the government to defeat the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). 

As Secretary of State for the Environment, Ridley opposed a low-cost housing development near his own property, earning him the title of &quot;NIMBY&quot; (&quot;Not in My Back Yard&quot;). He was also responsible for introducing the &quot;poll tax&quot; (formally known as the Community Charge), which was one of the main factors leading to Thatcher&#x27;s resignation in 1990. He was created a life peer in 1992.

==Background and education==
Ridley was the second son of Matthew White Ridley, 3rd Viscount Ridley, and Ursula ( Lutyens), daughter of architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. His elder brother was Matthew White Ridley, 4th Viscount Ridley. He was educated at West Downs School, Winchester, Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a third in mathematical moderations in 1947 and a second-class degree in engineering science in 1951. 

A contemporary at Eton was Tam Dalyell, later Labour MP for West Lothian. The two men were not even able to agree on whether or not Dalyell had been Ridley&#x27;s fag, though Dalyell greatly admired Ridley&#x27;s skills as an artist, quoting his teacher as saying that Ridley was &quot;more talented than his grandfather&quot; Edwin Lutyens.

Ridley held a national service commission as a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of The Loyal Regiment in 1947 and was later a Territorial Army captain in the Northumberland Hussars Yeomanry. He later became a civil engineer and company director.

==Political career, 1955–1979==
At the 1955 general election, Ridley unsuccessfully contested the safe Labour seat of Blyth. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Cirencester and Tewkesbury at the 1959 election. He was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary in 1962, and from 1964 he was a Select committee member before joining the front bench.

Ridley was made a parliamentary secretary in the Ministry of Technology briefly in 1970 before becoming a Parliamentary under-secretary of state in the Department of Trade and Industry. He came under pressure after a policy report he had authored in December 1969 on the break-up and privatisation of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders was leaked, where he had proposed that a Conservative government should cut up and &quot;butcher&quot; UCS and sell the government&#x27;s holdings, &quot;even for a pittance&quot;.

He left the government in 1972 after refusing the post of Arts Minister. Ridley told Patrick Cosgrave a few days later that &quot;Ted [Heath] thought that because I drew and painted things, I would like to be Minister for the Arts. I had to explain to him that the ministry should not exist, because it involved public expenditure&quot;.

In 1973, he co-founded the Selsdon Group, which was opposed to the abandonment of the radical 1970 manifesto by Edward Heath. He closed his keynote speech at the group&#x27;s launch by citing the &quot;Ten Cannots&quot; of William J. H. Boetcker, adding that they &quot;could well become the guiding principle of the Selsdon Group&quot;. The members of the group were seen as disloyal at the time but their ideas came to prominence in the Thatcher years.

==In government, 1979–1990==
When the Conservatives were returned to office at the 1979 general election, Ridley was appointed to the new Conservative government as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In this position he was assigned responsibility for policy concerning the Falkland Islands, a position in which according to Patrick Cosgrave, he did not acquit himself well and &quot;seriously misread the intentions of the Argentinian government&quot;. His first visit to the Islands was in July 1979, after which the Foreign Office considered the options, given that the idea of &#x27;Fortress Falklands&#x27; was deemed unfeasible on the grounds of cost – Britain could not afford to maintain a sufficiently powerful military presence on the Islands to deter an invasion.

Ridley held a secret, informal meeting with his Argentine opposite number Carlos Cavandoli in September 1980, and the two sides broadly agreed to a &quot;leaseback&quot; arrangement whereby nominal sovereignty would be given to Argentina but British administration would be maintained for a fixed number of years, likely 99, until the final handover, as well as co-operating on the Islands&#x27; economic development and exploitation of fish and potential oil resources. The meeting took place at a village hotel ten miles outside Geneva, Switzerland, under the pretext of a holiday for Ridley and his wife, so as to avoid Parliamentary and media accusations of a sell-out. Ridley returned to the Islands in November to try to persuade the Islanders to accept the proposal but they were unconvinced, and as he left islanders shouted abuse at him while playing a recording of &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;. A prominent local islands politician, Adrian Monk, also made what the then Governor of the islands, Sir Rex Hunt, described as a &#x27;Churchillian&#x27; explanation of the population&#x27;s views in a Falklands radio broadcast on 2 January 1981. Likewise, Parliament gave the proposals a hostile reception, pointing out that British people should not be transferred, against their wishes, to the control of an Argentine military junta which had committed multiple human rights violations. In the face of this opposition, the Conservative government once again reiterated that the Islanders&#x27; wishes were &#x27;paramount&#x27;.

In February 1981, with the support of the Islands&#x27; Councillors, the British government met Argentine representatives in New York but the British proposal for a sovereignty freeze was rejected by the junta. British intelligence reports continued to suggest that Argentina would invade the Islands only if it was convinced there was no prospect of eventual transfer of sovereignty.

Ridley advised that leaseback remained the only feasible solution and recommended that Britain initiate an education campaign to persuade the islanders. His fierce political opponent Tam Dalyell believed he was right and that but for Ridley&#x27;s &quot;confrontational style&quot;, &quot;off-handed and offensive disdain&quot; which upset both the islanders and the House of Commons, this policy could have avoided the war. The proposal was rejected by Lord Carrington who felt that any attempt to put pressure on Islanders would be counter-productive. However, the cumulative effect of stalled sovereignty negotiations, the British Nationality Act 1981 (which would deprive many Islanders of their rights as full British citizens), the announced withdrawal of , the shelving of plans to rebuild the Royal Marine barracks at Moody Brook, and the proposed closure of the British Antarctic Survey base at Grytviken on South Georgia, was to convince Argentina that Britain had no future interest in the Falkland Islands. Argentina invaded the islands in April 1982, beginning the Falklands War, but was repulsed in June of that year, with the islands remaining in British hands.

===Financial Secretary to the Treasury===
From 1981 to 1983 Ridley was the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

===Secretary of State for Transport===
Following the 1983 election, Ridley, always regarded by Margaret Thatcher as &quot;one of us&quot;, was a beneficiary of her move to cull the Tory wets and joined her cabinet as Secretary of State for Transport. In that role he played a major part in making preparations for a potential loss of coal supplies, which proved an important factor in deciding the outcome of the miners&#x27; strike. Ridley had long been acutely aware of the threat the trade unions could pose to the execution of Conservative policies and, in the wake of the Heath government&#x27;s union difficulties, had authored the Ridley Plan, which set out means of dealing with the trade unions and was a prototype for later developments. The Thatcher government attached considerable importance to being properly prepared for a major miners&#x27; strike and backed down from a confrontation with the miners in its first Parliament. By the time that the miners did strike, from early March 1984, considerable efforts had been made in ensuring the availability of stockpiled coal at power stations, non-unionised transport workers and oil-fired generation plant.

He oversaw bus deregulation with the Transport Act 1985 as a precursor to privatisation of bus services. This led to a period of intense competition between rival bus companies, known at the time as the bus wars and the dramatic subsequent growth of Stagecoach Group, FirstGroup and the other major bus operators.

Never far from controversy, Ridley had to apologise following the &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot; disaster in 1987, for remarking that he would not be pursuing a particular policy &quot;with the bow doors open&quot;. The ship had capsized, with loss of 193 lives, as a result of sailing with its bow doors open.

===Secretary of State for the Environment===
As Secretary of State for the Environment from 1986 to 1989, he is credited with popularising the phrase NIMBY or &quot;Not in My Back Yard&quot; to describe those who instinctively opposed any local building development. It was soon revealed that Ridley opposed a low cost housing development near a village where he owned a property. More importantly, he was the Cabinet Minister responsible for the introduction of the &#x27;Poll tax&#x27; (formally known as the Community Charge), a policy that brought a standing ovation at the Conservative Party conference at which it was announced, and riots across the country when it was implemented. Ridley had reduced the implementation timetable from 5 to 2 years, which made it much easier for opponents to identify &#x27;losers&#x27; and gain support for protest.

===Secretary of State for Trade and Industry===
On 14 July 1990, he was forced to resign as Secretary of State for Trade and Industry after an interview was published by &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He had described the proposed Economic and Monetary Union as &quot;a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe&quot; and said that giving up sovereignty to the European Union was as bad as giving it up to Adolf Hitler. The interview was illustrated with a cartoon depicting Ridley running away having added a Hitler moustache to a poster of the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. While Ridley was not one of the most powerful government members, he was regarded as a Thatcherite loyalist and his departure was a significant break in their ranks. Margaret Thatcher herself resigned a few months later. Some commentators point to Ridley&#x27;s resignation, its manner, and the European issue at its core, as leading indicators for the next decade of Conservative Party politics. On 8 November 1991, Ridley advised people to vote for anti-European candidates regardless of their parties.

===Baron Ridley of Liddesdale===
On 28 July 1992, Ridley was created a life peer as Baron Ridley of Liddesdale, of Willimoteswick in the County of Northumberland. Despite being a free-marketeer, in January 1993 Ridley spoke out against railway privatisation, and when in government, advised Thatcher against enacting it. The final speech he gave was an address against the Maastricht Treaty on 17 February 1993 in the House of Lords, which he had always vehemently opposed and voted against in 1991. In an article for &quot;The Times&quot; written days before he died, he suggested that the rich should be taxed more to help Britain out of the recession.

At the 1996 Nicholas Ridley Memorial Lecture, Thatcher said of Ridley that,

Ridley was also secretary of the Canning Club, a councillor on Castle Ward Rural District Council and a member of the executive committee of the National Trust.

==Personal life==
Lord Ridley of Liddesdale was married to Clayre Campbell, daughter of Alistair Campbell, 4th Baron Stratheden and Campbell. They divorced in 1974. They had three daughters: social worker Susanna Rickett, designer and writer Jessica Ridley, and historian Jane Ridley, Professor of History at the University of Buckingham. He was a keen water colourist and photographer.

In 1990, asked to comment on the resignation of his cabinet colleague Norman Fowler who had given as the reason for his resignation the wish &quot;to spend more time with my family&quot;, Ridley quipped that the last thing he wanted to do was spend more time with his family.

Ridley&#x27;s puppet on &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was always portrayed with a cigarette. He died of lung cancer on 4 March 1993.

<text>The 2003 Tour de France was a multiple stage bicycle race held from 5 to 27 July, and the 90th edition of the Tour de France. It has no overall winner—although American cyclist Lance Armstrong originally won the event, the United States Anti-Doping Agency announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from 1999 to 2005; the Union Cycliste Internationale has confirmed this verdict.

The event started and ended in Paris, covering proceeding clockwise in twenty stages around France, including six major mountain stages. Due to the centennial celebration, this edition of the tour was raced entirely in France and did not enter neighboring countries.

In the centenary year of the race the route recreated, in part, that of 1903. There was a special &quot;Centenaire Classement&quot; prize for the best-placed in each of the six stage finishes which match the 1903 tour – Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes and Paris. It was won by Stuart O&#x27;Grady, with Thor Hushovd in second place. The 2003 Tour was honored with the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport.

Of the 198 riders the favourite was again Armstrong, aiming for a record equalling fifth win. Before the race, it was believed that his main rivals would include Iban Mayo, Aitor González, Tyler Hamilton, Ivan Basso, Gilberto Simoni, Jan Ullrich, and Joseba Beloki but Armstrong was the odds-on favourite. Though he did go on to win the race, it is statistically, and by Armstrong&#x27;s own admission, his weakest Tour from his seven-year period of dominance over the race.

==Teams==
The team selection was done in three rounds: in November 2002, the fourteen highest-ranking Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) teams would automatically qualify; four wildcard invitations were given in January 2003, and four more in mid-May. The race started with 22 teams of 9 cyclists.

The teams entering the race were:

Qualified teams
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 
Invited teams
*

==Pre-race favourites==
Some notable cyclists excluded from the race were Mario Cipollini and Marco Pantani, whose teams and were not selected. Especially the absence of Cipollini, the reigning world champion, came as a surprise. The Tour organisation gave the reason that Cipollini had never been able to finish the race.

In the first round, the Coast team had been selected to compete, and in January 2003 they signed Jan Ullrich. Financial problems then almost prevented the team from starting, but after Bianchi stepped in as a new sponsor, Team Bianchi was allowed to take the place of Team Coast.

==Route and stages==

The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 8.

==Race overview==

The Tour proved to be one more hotly contested than the previous years. Tyler Hamilton and Levi Leipheimer were involved in a crash early in the Tour. Leipheimer dropped out, Hamilton continued and got fourth place in the end while riding with a broken collarbone.

In the Alps, Gilberto Simoni and Stefano Garzelli, first and second in the Giro d&#x27;Italia earlier the same year, could not keep up with Lance Armstrong and the other favourites. The same held for last year&#x27;s number 4, Santiago Botero. Joseba Beloki could, and was in second-place overall (just 40 seconds behind Armstrong) when he crashed on a fast descent from the Cote de La Rochette, shortly after passing the Col de Manse into Gap. The crash was a result of a locked brake, caused by a lack of traction from melting tar on the road, which led to the tyre coming off the rim. Beloki broke his right femur, elbow and wrist, and had to leave the Tour. Armstrong made a detour through the field beside the road to avoid the fallen Beloki. Armstrong was in yellow, but Jan Ullrich won the first time trial by one minute and 36 seconds. He and Alexander Vinokourov were both within very short distance from Armstrong.

===Doping===

Subsequent to Armstrong&#x27;s statement to withdraw his fight against United States Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles. Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes. On 22 October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==

There were four main individual classifications contested in the 2003 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider&#x27;s finishing times on each stage. There were time bonuses given at the end of each mass start stage. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.

The second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage&#x27;s type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.

The third classification was the mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.

The final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1977. The leader wore a white jersey.

The final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time.

There was special classification, the &quot;Centenaire&quot;, which combined times of riders across the six stages involving cities visited during 1903 Tour. The cities were: Lyon, on stage 6; Marseille, on stage 10; Toulouse, on stage 11; Bordeaux, on stage 17; Nantes, on stage 19; and Paris, on stage 20.

In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have &quot;shown the greatest effort and demonstrated the greatest sporting spirit&quot;. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Alexander Vinokourov () won the overall super-combativity award.

There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given in honour of Tour founder and first race director Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 8, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given in honour of the second director Jacques Goddet to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 15. Stefano Garzelli won the Henri Desgrange and Sylvain Chavanel won the Jacques Goddet.

*In stage 1, David Millar wore the green jersey.
*In stage 8, Rolf Aldag wore the polka-dot jersey.

<text>Ashby de la Zouch Castle is a ruined fortification in the town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, England. The castle was built by William, Lord Hastings, a favourite of Edward IV, after 1473, accompanied by the creation of a park. Constructed on the site of an older manor house, two large towers and various smaller buildings had been constructed by 1483, when Hastings was executed by Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The Hastings family used the castle as their seat for several generations, improving the gardens and hosting royal visitors.

During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Henry, a younger son in the Hastings family, became a Royalist commander in the Midlands. He based himself at the castle until he was forced to surrender it after a long siege. A fresh rebellion occurred in 1648, leading Parliament to slight the castle in order to prevent it being used militarily: the two towers were badly damaged with gunpowder and undermining. Parts of the remaining castle were turned into a new house and continued to be used by members of the Hastings family for many years, although they moved their main residence to Donington Hall.

The castle became famous after it featured in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in 1819, and its owner, Francis Rawdon, opened the ruins to visitors. Restoration work was carried out over the course of the next century, but by 1932 the Rawdon family could no longer afford to maintain the castle. It passed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works, who carried out extensive repairs and opened the castle gardens. In the 21st century, the castle is managed by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 15,164 visitors in 2015. The historian John Goodall considers the site to be an &quot;outstanding example of a late medieval castle&quot;, with its grounds forming &quot;one of the best-preserved and most important&quot; examples of an early Tudor garden.

== History ==
=== 11th–15th centuries ===

A manor had existed at Ashby-de-la-Zouch from at least 1086, when the location was known as Ascebi. The lands were acquired by Robert de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan and later Earl of Leicester, in 1100. He established the Belmeis family there as his tenants and, after the Belmeis family line died out in 1160, the earls of Leicester reassigned the estate to the La Zouche family, from whom the manor took its later name.

At some point during this period, a manor house was constructed on the same site as the later castle, with a hall and a solar. A settlement grew up alongside the house and, by 1334, the town was probably the sixth-largest in the county. By the mid-1300s, the manor house reportedly included a hall, a chamber, a long house containing service facilities, and was surrounded by a dovecote, orchard and a rabbit warren, accompanied by a deer park. The hall and solar were rebuilt by the le Zouches during the second half of the 14th century, but the building remained what the historian Norman Pounds has called a &quot;rather modest manor house&quot;.

The le Zouch line died out in 1399, leaving the inheritance of the family estates uncertain. The manor probably passed to Sir Hugh Burnell and, around 1420, onto James Butler, the Earl of Ormond and Wiltshire. The Wars of the Roses broke out in England during 1455 between the rival supporters of the Lancastrian and Yorkist factions. James, a Lancastrian, was captured at the Battle of Towton by the Yorkist leader Edward IV in 1461 and executed; the Crown seized his estates, including the manor of Ashby de la Zouch.

Ashby de la Zouch was converted into a castle by William, Lord Hastings, a favourite of Edward IV; as a minor nobleman he had fought alongside Edward at Towton, but was then knighted and later became the chamberlain of the royal household and the Lieutenant of Calais. William acquired extensive estates across the Midlands during the wars, much of them confiscated from his enemies. Amongst these was Ashby de la Zouch, which was given to William in 1462. His father, Sir Leonard, had maintained the family seat at nearby Kirby Muxloe, but after 1471 William began to use Ashby de la Zouch as his primary residence.

In 1474, Edward granted William the right to crenellate, or fortify, four of his manors and to build deer parks around them. William set about developing the old manorial complex at Ashby de la Zouch with new buildings, and was authorised to create a huge park around it. His intent appears to have been to construct a substantial castle, similar to the royal fortifications at Tutbury and Nottingham, with four huge towers. Work appears to have already started on the site the year before permission was formally given, although it is uncertain whether this referred to the construction of the castle&#x27;s chapel, or if William had already begun work on the first tower, gambling that the King would subsequently approve it.

Edward IV died in 1483, leaving the kingdom to his young son, Edward V, but his uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, had his own ambitions for the throne. Lord Hastings was unwilling to support the deposition of Edward V and, as a consequence, Richard summarily executed him that June, ahead of his own coronation. Ashby de la Zouch Castle, only partially completed, and Lord Hastings&#x27; other estates were then restored to his widow, Katherine.

=== 16th–17th centuries ===

The castle passed to William&#x27;s son, Edward Hastings, who appears to have spent little time at the property, although he hosted a visit from Henry VIII in 1503. It was then inherited by his son, George, who was a royal favourite of Henry VIII and made the Earl of Huntington in 1529, which led to him rebuilding parts of the castle in brick and redesigning the gardens. Henry Hastings inherited the castle in 1560, where he maintained a household of 77 servants. Henry Hastings used it to imprison Mary Queen of Scots in 1569 after she was accused of plotting against Elizabeth I, although he spent most of his time at York, where he led the Council of the North.

It passed onto his younger brother, George, who entertained Queen Anne, Princess Elizabeth, and Prince Henry there on 22 June 1603. The Countess of Derby was welcomed in August 1607 with the &quot;Masque at Ashby Castle&quot;. His grandson, Henry hosted James I three times between 1612 and 1617, and Charles I in 1634. The gardens were redeveloped, probably to provide a suitable venue for these royal visits. By now, however, several generations of excessive expenditure meant that the family estates had been much diminished, and the family was having trouble maintaining their lavish lifestyle and former prominence in the region.

In 1642, the English Civil War broke out between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament. Henry Hasting briefly joined the royalist cause before his death in 1643, but his eldest son Ferdinando, who inherited the family earldom, remained neutral during the conflict. Ferdinando&#x27;s younger brother Henry, however, became a key Royalist commander in the Midlands. The castle was strategically well-placed, linking the Royalist territories in the north and the west of England, and giving easy access to the River Trent. Henry used the castle as his base of operations across the region, protecting it by establishing smaller outposts near Donnington and Shardlow. Buildings in the town of Ashby de la Zouch were pulled down to provide materiel to refortify the castle and town, tunnels were dug and an &quot;Irish fort&quot; constructed to help protect the castle.

In early 1643, Parliament placed Newark under siege, and the garrison at Ashby was sent to relieve it. As part of a larger force under Prince Rupert, they forced the surrender of the Parliamentary force. By late 1644, the war turned against the King, and the Parliamentary forces based at nearby Coleorton had contained the garrison in the castle. King Charles passed through the castle in May 1645 on his way to besiege Leicester, but the following month his forces were defeated at the Battle of Naseby; the King briefly stayed at the castle once again as he retreated west. By now, the Royalist cause was largely lost.

Henry returned to the castle from Leicester in September, where another 600 Royalist soldiers soon joined him and its 60-man garrison, carrying out raids on Parliamentary convoys and the garrison at Coleorton. Plague broke out at the end of the year, forcing the besiegers to retreat to Leicester, while the garrison temporarily abandoned the castle buildings and occupied the neighbouring park. Once the epidemic passed, Parliament began to raid the town and Henry worked through Ferdinando to agree the surrender of the castle on good terms: this was achieved in February 1646, and allowed for the release of himself, the garrison and their weapons.

In May 1648, a Royalist rebellion broke out in Kent. There were fresh Parliamentary concerns about Henry Hastings and fears grew that he might reoccupy Ashby de la Zouch Castle. Lord Grey – a rival of the Hastings family in Leicestershire – was put in charge of the castle in August, which was used to hold Royalist prisoners, including James Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton. Parliamentary worries about the security of the castle persisted and, possibly because of Henry&#x27;s involvement in the recent rebellion, William Bainbrigg was ordered in November to slight the castle to put it beyond military use. He carried out his orders immediately, demolishing one side of the Great Tower and the Kitchen Tower, undermining the foundations and deploying gunpowder charges.

The Hastings family suffered financially as a result of the war, and Ferdinando was imprisoned for debt in 1653. The family moved to Donington Hall, although some of the remains of the castle were repaired to form a house called Ashby Place, which lay on the north side of the site in the old outer court. Selina Hastings, the Countess of Huntingdon, lived there after 1746. With the deterioration of the castle and the departure of the Hastings, the neighbouring town also fell into decline. With the death of Francis Hastings in 1789, the castle was inherited by Francis Rawdon, who later became the Earl of Moira.

=== 18th–21st centuries ===

In 1819, Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; featured a scene involving a tournament at Ashby de la Zouch Castle; the novel was immensely popular and made the location famous. Edward Mammatt, Francis Rawdon&#x27;s agent, repaired the castle ruins and opened them to visitors, whom Rawdon hoped to attract to the Ivanhoe Baths which he opened nearby. Ashby Place, which had become used as a House of Industry, was pulled down in 1830 and a new house, Ashby Manor, was built in its place. Work continued throughout the 19th century to repair the castle ruins, although they remained mostly covered in ivy.

A local architect, Thomas Fosbrooke, carried out the first archaeological investigation of the site in 1900, and extensive restoration work took place the following years. The Rawdon family were given a government grant for further repairs in 1912 and they began to start charging visitors for entry. The family found themselves unable to afford to maintain the castle, and by the early 1930s the walls had become unstable and dangerous. The castle was placed into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1932, who carried out repairs, replacing some stonework and opening up the surrounding grounds to visitors.

In the 21st century, the castle is managed by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, receiving 15,164 visitors in 2015. An archaeological investigation of the castle gardens was carried out in 2006. The site is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.

== Architecture and landscape ==
=== Architecture ===

The ruins of Ashby de la Zouch Castle are located close to the centre of the modern town, and comprise two large towers and associated buildings arranged around a court, with formal gardens to the south. Lord Hastings probably intended his castle to ultimately have four large towers, enclosing the interior buildings with a curtain wall to a regular design, but only half of these towers were completed by the time of his death. The outer court that lay to the north of the surviving complex has been lost; having been converted into first Ashby Place, and then Ashby Manor, it is now occupied by the Manor House Preparatory School. The historian John Goodall considers Ashby de la Zouch to form an &quot;outstanding example of a late medieval castle&quot;.

The Kitchen Tower stands on the north-west corner of the castle and was intended to supply Lord Hasting&#x27;s large household. The tower only had two storeys, as the ground floor kitchen had a very high, high vaulted ceiling, and its walls were thick and made of yellow sandstone. The well-lit kitchen had several hearths and an oven for cooking, a well and a cellar for storage. Above the kitchen was a large room, probably used as a winter parlour. One wall of the tower was slighted in 1648. An underground passage, probably dating from the English Civil War, links the Great Tower with the Kitchen Tower.

Alongside the tower, separated for fire safety by a roofed passageway, was a two-storey service range, including a buttery and pantry. The castle&#x27;s Great Hall was adapted from the medieval original, and would originally have been subdivided by a line of arches. It was heated by a central heath and the lord and his guests would have eaten on a raised dais at the far end of the hall. The building was raised in height, given new windows and reroofed in the second half of the 17th century. The Great Chamber was a two-storey building, originally with a parlour on the ground level, with a chamber above it used for entertaining guests. Running north from the Great Chamber was a range of buildings used by the senior household staff.

The large chapel, and built of grey sandstone, lies alongside the Great Chamber, and would originally had an altar on a dais at the north end. One corner of the chapel remains in use as a burial site by the modern Hastings family. An inner, or chapel, court would have been formed by a range of buildings, since lost, stretching between the chapel and the Great Tower. The historian Anthony Emery notes that the castle would have formed a &quot;palace fortress&quot;, with the sizeable chapel and adjacent towers constituting symbols of Hastings&#x27; power and authority.

The Great Tower was a large structure of grey sandstone, tall, formed of a four-storey tower, internally, linked to a smaller seven-storey tower or turret, across. The ground floor contained the basement and the entrance-way, protected by a portcullis. The first floor held the kitchen, and had a fire-proof stone-vaulted roof. The upper floors consisted of a parlour and a separate great chamber for the lord, with a withdrawing chamber to one side, all with grander windows than the lower levels, with excellent views of the gardens and the parkland beyond. A treasure chamber, accessible only from the upper storeys using a ladder, was built into the first floor. Emery considers the &quot;richness of the upper rooms and the tower&#x27;s planning and design qualities&quot; to be outstanding, and likens it to the Yellow Tower of Gwent at Raglan Castle.

=== Gardens and parkland ===

The current gardens to the south of the castle date from around 1530; they occupy , and include two sunken areas, separated by a walkway. The eastern area may have been intended to imitate defensive bastion works, and it originally featured a circular brick tower in the middle of it. The site would originally have had a brick wall running all the way around it, of which only the south-east edge survives. Two brick towers survive at the southern corners, one resembling a clover-leaf, the other with an octagonal design, and would have originally been used as banqueting houses. Beyond the gardens would have been an area planted with trees, called &quot;the wilderness&quot;, and smaller compartmented garden and ponds. A triangular building called &quot;the Mount&quot; was built in the wilderness in the early 17th century, and is now a private house. John Goodall considers them to be &quot;one of the best-preserved and most important early Tudor gardens in England&quot;.

The original park probably lay just to the south of the castle, incorporating the current gardens; it was probably expanded to around by William Hastings, and was later named the &quot;Little Park&quot;. The original boundaries of the other two parks associated with castle to the north and west, Great Park and Prestop Park, are uncertain.

<text>The World Esperanto Congress (, UK) is an annual Esperanto convention. It has the longest tradition among international Esperanto conventions, with an almost unbroken run for 119 years. The congresses have been held since August 5, 1905, every year, except during World War I, World War II, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the 1920s, the Universal Esperanto Association has been organizing these congresses.

These congresses take place every year and, over the 30 years from 1985 through 2014, have gathered an average of about 2,000 participants (since World War II it has varied from 800 to 6,000, depending on the venue). The average number of countries represented is about 60. Some specialized organizations also gather a few hundred participants in their annual meetings. The World Congress usually takes place in the last week of July or first week of August, beginning and ending on a Saturday (8 days in total). For many years ILERA has operated an amateur radio station during the conventions.

Until 1980, meetings were held in Europe and the United States, with the exception of Japan in 1965. Since then, other countries have been Brazil, Canada, China, Cuba, South Korea, Australia, Israel, Vietnam and Argentina. In 2024, the congress was held in Africa for the first time, in Arusha, Tanzania.

<doc id="260996" wikidata="Q204590" url="?curid=260996" title="Christian Slater">
<text>Christian Michael Leonard Slater (born August 18, 1969) is an American actor. He made his film debut with a leading role in &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; (1985) and gained wider recognition for his breakout role as Jason &quot;J.D.&quot; Dean, a sociopathic high school student, in the satire &quot;Heathers&quot; (1988). He received critical acclaim for playing the title role in the USA Network television series &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; (2015–2019): it earned him the 2016 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, and additional nominations for that award in 2017 and 2018. For his role as Mulgarath in fantasy series &quot;The Spiderwick Chronicles&quot; (2024-present), Slater received a nomination for the Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Performer.

In the 1990s, Slater starred in a number of big-budget films, including &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990), &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991), &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994), &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996), and &quot;Hard Rain&quot; (1998) as well as cult films like 
&quot;Gleaming the Cube&quot; (1989), &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; (1990) and &quot;True Romance&quot; (1993). He has had roles in other notable films, including &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), &quot;&quot; (1988), &quot;Windtalkers&quot; (2002), &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (2005), &quot;Bobby&quot; (2006), &quot;He Was a Quiet Man&quot; (2007), &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot; (2013), &quot;The Wife&quot; (2017), &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; (2020), and &quot;Blink Twice&quot; (2024).

In addition to his live-action roles, Slater has had an extensive voice-acting career, with roles including Pips in &quot;&quot; (1992), Slater in &quot;Archer&quot; (2014–2023), Ushari in &quot;The Lion Guard&quot; (2016–2019), Rand Ridley in &quot;Inside Job&quot; (2021–2022), and Floyd Lawton / Deadshot in the DC Animated Movie Universe.

==Early life and education ==
Slater was born on August 18, 1969, in New York City, the son of Michael Hawkins (born Thomas Knight Slater), an actor also known as Michael Gainsborough; and Mary Jo Slater (née Lawton), an actors’ agent turned casting executive and producer. He has a maternal half-brother, Ryan Slater, who also became an actor. His great-uncle was radio personality Bill Slater. 

He attended the Dalton School, the Professional Children&#x27;s School and the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts.

==Career==

===1977–1990: Early success===
Slater played his first television role at the age of eight, on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Following a run on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;, he made his Broadway debut as the lisping Winthrop Paroo opposite Dick Van Dyke in the 1980 revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot;. Additional Broadway credits include &quot;Copperfield&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Side Man&quot;, and &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. He also performed in London&#x27;s West End in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;Swimming with Sharks&quot;. 

Slater made his big-screen debut in &quot;The Legend of Billie Jean&quot; (1985), playing Billie Jean&#x27;s brother Binx. The film had been expected to be a big hit, but fell short at the box office. It has since gained a cult following. His career improved with a role in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), playing alongside Sean Connery. Slater played Connery&#x27;s apprentice monk, and they investigated a series of murders at a Benedictine abbey. Slater next played Junior Tucker in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1988).

At the age of 18, Slater played the dark character J.D. in the 1988 film &quot;Heathers&quot; alongside Winona Ryder. Slater was chosen for the part over many other actors, including Brad Pitt, and his performance drew a comparison with a young Jack Nicholson. Slater also starred in &quot;Gleaming the Cube&quot; and appeared in &quot;Beyond the Stars&quot; (both 1989). After &quot;Heathers&quot;, Slater had offers to play other troubled youths, including a rebellious teen in &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; (1990) and a wild gunman in &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990). In the latter, Slater acted alongside Emilio Estevez, Lou Diamond Phillips and Kiefer Sutherland.

===1991–1999: Box office success===
In 1991, Slater was cast as Will Scarlett in the Hollywood big budget production of &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; alongside Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman. The film was a commercial success, taking US$390 million worldwide, and Slater became one of the major A-list stars of the 1990s. With Slater being a big &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan (in addition to his mother, Mary Jo Slater, serving as the casting director for the film), he accepted a cameo role in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, shortly after playing Charlie Luciano in the crime drama &quot;Mobsters&quot;. The following year he expanded his film genre and starred in the comedy &quot;Kuffs&quot; opposite Milla Jovovich. In 1993, Slater again stretched his acting skills, playing opposite Marisa Tomei in &quot;Untamed Heart&quot; and playing Clarence Worley in &quot;True Romance&quot;, written by Quentin Tarantino, which received many rave reviews. In his review of &quot;True Romance&quot;, Roger Ebert awarded the movie 3 stars out of 4 and said, &quot;the energy and style of the movie are exhilarating. Christian Slater has the kind of cocky recklessness the movie needs.&quot; In the same year he was the first choice for the role of Eric Draven in the movie &quot;The Crow&quot; directed by Alex Proyas. 

He gained the role of the interviewer Daniel Molloy in &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994) after the death of his friend River Phoenix, who was originally cast. Slater subsequently donated his earnings from the film to Phoenix&#x27;s favorite charities. He played the character of Lewis in the romance film &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; in 1996 opposite Mary Stuart Masterson, then that of Riley Hale in the big-budget John Woo film &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1996), which also starred John Travolta. In 1998 Slater appeared in crime movie &quot;Hard Rain&quot; alongside Morgan Freeman. The same year he also starred in the dark comedy &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; opposite Cameron Diaz.

===2000–present: Television roles, &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;===

Since 2000 Slater has mixed TV work with leading roles in mainly lower budget films, along with supporting roles in a few mainstream productions. He appeared in the successful &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Alias&quot; TV series. He was also part of Hollywood films, including &quot;Bobby&quot; and &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot;. He has also worked as a voice-over artist in productions, including the character of &#x27;Pips&#x27; in the successful Australian animated film &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius&quot;, and TV documentaries, including &quot;Prehistoric Planet&quot; and &quot;Dinosaur Planet&quot;. Slater also voiced the character John Watson a.k.a. &quot;Wonko the Sane&quot; in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s production of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

Slater starred in the television series &quot;My Own Worst Enemy&quot; in 2008 and &quot;The Forgotten&quot; in 2009. In 2011 he co-starred in the action film &quot;The River Murders&quot;, with Ray Liotta and Ving Rhames. Also in 2011, he starred in the television series, &quot;Breaking In&quot;, which ran for two seasons. Slater co-starred with Ving Rhames in the film &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot; (2012), and in the Sylvester Stallone action thriller &quot;Bullet to the Head&quot; (2013), directed by Walter Hill. He co-starred in the 2014 television series, &quot;Mind Games&quot;, which was cancelled after five episodes were aired. He was part of the ensemble in Lars von Trier&#x27;s controversial film, &quot;Nymphomaniac&quot;.

In October 2014, Slater signed on for his title role in the television series on USA Network &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;. Slater plays a computer hacker, &quot;Mr. Robot,&quot; who recruits Rami Malek&#x27;s character, Elliot, into Slater&#x27;s band of hackers called fsociety. The series premiered on June 24, 2015, and concluded in 2019 with its fourth season. For his performance, he earned the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2016, with additional nominations in 2017 and 2018.

Prior to beginning his role in &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;, Slater announced in 2013 that he was developing and making a film based on Will Viharo&#x27;s 1993 neo-noir novel &quot;Love Stories Are Too Violent for Me&quot;, the first of three works to feature Vic Valentine. However, the success of &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; and contracts for additional seasons has delayed his being able to develop his adaptation.

Slater voices the character &quot;Slater&quot; on the FX original series &quot;Archer&quot;. He also provided the voice of Ushari the Egyptian Cobra in &quot;The Lion Guard&quot;. He also made a short film for HP called &quot;The Wolf&quot;, which shows how easily malware can spread on unprotected printers and computers. In 2018, Christian Slater appeared in &quot;The Public&quot;, the latest film by Emilio Estevez. At the world premiere of the film at the Toronto Film Festival, Slater discussed his role, Josh Davis, with &quot;Ikon London Magazine&quot;: 
&quot;He (Josh Davis) is definitely the character in the movie who represents that side of politics where he is not as open-hearted as you&#x27;d like him to be. He is definitely the guy who feels this is all a mess. And he is a law and order politician in this movie. So hopefully, he is the kind of guy you love to hate&quot;. From 2021 to 2022, he voiced the character Rand Ridley on the adult sci-fi animated sitcom &quot;Inside Job&quot;. The show&#x27;s creator announced the cancellation of the show in January 2023.

==Personal life==
In 2000, Slater married Ryan Haddon, the daughter of model Dayle Haddon. They have two children, a son, Jaden Christopher, born in 1999, and a daughter, Eliana Sophia, born in 2001. In 2003, Haddon was arrested for assaulting Slater during an argument at a Hard Rock Cafe while on vacation in Las Vegas. Haddon allegedly threw a glass bottle and cut Slater&#x27;s neck. The wound required 20 stitches. Haddon was charged with domestic battery, booked at Las Vegas&#x27; Clark County Detention Center, and freed after posting bond. They announced their separation over Christmas in 2004. Slater was living in London at the time, performing in a stage version of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. The couple officially separated in 2005 and divorced in 2007.

On December 2, 2013, Slater married Brittany Lopez in Florida after three years of dating. They have a daughter together, born in August 2019, and a son, born in July 2024.

Slater practices Kempo Karate and divides his time between Coconut Grove in Miami, Florida and Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, Manhattan.

===Legal issues===
Slater has had difficulties with substance abuse and has undergone treatment. In 1989, Slater was arrested for drunk driving. He was sentenced to ten days in jail. At one time he said, &quot;Work is my hobby, staying sober is my job.&quot; After living in recovery, he said in 2009, &quot;Work is my job, and having adventures with my kids. My kids are all-important.&quot; 
The illusion of being very cool, that drinking is the hip thing to do and that you&#x27;ll seem like Clark Gable. You go to a party and have a drink and feel like a superhero when the truth is you&#x27;re looking rather foolish. Showing up for life 24/7 straight and sober can be tough if you&#x27;re riddled with insecurities. Actually, the fastest way of knowing who you are is to know who you&#x27;re not.

In 1994, he was arrested when he tried to board a commercial plane with a gun in his baggage. He was sentenced to three days of community service.

In 1997, Slater was convicted of punching his girlfriend, Michelle Jonas, and assaulting a police officer while under the influence of heroin, cocaine, and alcohol. He had consumed them for two days straight and had little to no sleep. He was treated for more than 100 days in a rehabilitation facility while on bail, and then was sentenced to a three-month term in jail, followed by three months in a residential rehab center. He was released from prison after 59 days on the basis of good behavior.

On May 24, 2005, Slater was arrested in Manhattan, after allegedly groping a woman on the street. Slater was charged with third-degree sexual abuse. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence and on the condition that Slater keep out of trouble for six months.

==Philanthropy==
Slater has been a supporter of several charities, including 21st Century Leaders, Global Green, and Whatever It Takes. Slater appeared in an educational video on behalf of Nelson Mandela’s 46664 charity for AIDS awareness. He has also worked to promote humanitarian work in South Africa. In early May 2009, Slater visited wounded and recovering soldiers of Walter Reed Army Medical Center for the USO. On December 10, 2009, Slater visited Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where he contributed work for the television show &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot;. The episode aired on March 21, 2010.

<text>The St. Marys River, sometimes written St. Mary&#x27;s River, drains Lake Superior, starting at the end of Whitefish Bay and flowing southeast into Lake Huron, with a fall of . For its entire length it is an international border, separating Michigan in the United States from Ontario, Canada.

The twin cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan are connected across the St. Marys River by the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge. The St. Marys Rapids are just below the river&#x27;s exit from Lake Superior and can be bypassed by huge freight ships through the man-made Soo Locks and the Sault Ste. Marie Canal.

Two of the Ontario tributaries of this river are the Garden River and the Bar River. Other Canadian tributaries include Fort Creek, the Root River, the Little Carp River, the Big Carp River, the Lower Echo River, Desbarats River, and the Two Tree River. The US tributaries to the St. Marys River are the Gogomain River, the Munuscong River, the Little Munuscong River, the Charlotte River, and the Waiska River.

==History==

Before Europeans arrived, Ojibwe (Chippewa) Indigenous Americans fished, traded, and maintained a portage around the rapids of the St. Marys River, which they referred to as &#x27;, meaning &quot;at the cascading rapids&quot;. French explorer Étienne Brûlé was the first European to travel up the rapids in about 1621. In 1641 Jesuit priests Isaac Jogues and Charles Raymbault ventured the same route as Brûlé, finding many Ojibwe at the rapids, and named it Sault Ste. Marie. &quot;Sault&quot; (Middle and early Modern French spelling of &#x27;) means &quot;jump&quot;; hence, the secondary meaning &quot;rapids&quot; because the water &#x27;jumps.&#x27;

Fort St. Joseph was built on the Canadian shore in 1796 to protect a trading post, and ensure continued British control of the area. The fort fulfilled its role in the War of 1812.

The first modern lock was completed in May 1855 by Erastus Corning&#x27;s St. Mary&#x27;s Falls Ship Canal Company, and was known as the &quot;American Lock&quot;. Today, there are four parallel locks on the American side of the river, although only two are in regular use. The Soo Locks became part of the Great Lakes Waterway system in 1959.

Partially due to the American refusal of passage through the Soo Locks during the Wolseley Expedition, a Canadian Lock was built in 1895. The current Canadian Lock is used for recreational boats and is a National Historic Site of Canada.

During World War II, the Soo Locks and the St. Marys River waterway were heavily guarded by U.S. and Canadian forces coordinated by the U.S. Army&#x27;s Central Defense Command. During the waterway&#x27;s usable season from March through November, 90 percent of the United States&#x27; iron ore production for domestic use passed through it in 1939, making the waterway critical to maintaining war production. A battalion of infantry, stationed at nearby Fort Brady, provided security beginning just after the outbreak of the European war in September 1939; this was reduced to a company in mid-1940 and replaced by a military police battalion in May 1941. After Pearl Harbor in December 1941, fear of possible air or paratroop attacks by German forces led to a major expansion of defence measures. Scenarios envisioned included U-boats in Hudson Bay launching attack aircraft, and one-way bombing or paratroop missions along a great circle route from German-occupied Norway. Units deployed included the 131st Infantry Regiment, an anti-aircraft regiment, and a barrage balloon battalion for a total in mid-1942 of 7,000 troops in the area. Canada provided an anti-aircraft battalion, elements of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, barracks and defensive positions for some of the U.S. force, and a warning system of 266 aircraft observation posts of the Aircraft Identity Corps extending northward to Hudson Bay. This was augmented by five U.S.-staffed radar stations in northern Ontario. By late 1943, with no threat emerging and spare components stockpiled in the event of lock damage, the U.S. forces were cut to 2,500 troops, and the AA and air warning defences were abandoned. In January 1944 the garrison was further reduced to a single military police battalion.

==Works==

===Bridges===

The Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, a steel truss arch bridge, takes road traffic across the river. Directly to the west is the Sault Ste. Marie International Railroad Bridge, which carries rail traffic on a single set of tracks.

===Power plants===
The Edison Sault Electric Hydroelectric Plant, located at the eastern end of the Sault Ste. Marie Power Canal which runs between Lake Superior and Lake Huron through the city south of the American locks, is one of the longest hydroelectric plants in the world at in length. The plant consists of 74 three-phase generators capable of generating 25 to 30 megawatts. It was completed in 1902. The hydro plant is faced with stone quarried during the excavation of the Sault Ste. Marie Power Canal.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers owns and operates a hydroelectric generating plant directly north of the American locks.

Finally, the Francis H. Clergue Generating Station, owned and operated by Brookfield Renewable Energy, Inc., is a hydroelectric generating plant located directly north of the Canadian lock with a generating capacity of 52 MW. It was completed in 1981.

=== Canal ===
The Edison Sault Power Canal is used to power the Saint Marys Falls Hydropower Plant at its eastern end. The canal separated downtown Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, from its mainland, making it an island. It was begun in September 1898 as the Michigan Lake Superior Power Company Canal, but completed by Edison Sault Electric Company in June 1902. Measured from its headgates to its end at the power plant, it is in length, between wide, and deep. The water runs down the canal at speeds upwards of .

===Locks===

The American Soo Locks are the major transportation route around the St. Marys Rapids, but the Canadian Sault Ste. Marie Canal is still used by recreational and tour boats.

===Other works===

A set of compensating works are located at the mouth of the rapids, which are used to control the outflow of water from Lake Superior. Completed between 1901 and 1921, the works were built to provide greater supply of the rivers flow through the three hydroelectric plants and locks on the river. This flow is controlled by the International Joint Commission. The works consists of 16 sluice gates, half of which are on the American side, and the other half on the Canadian side of the river. On average, upwards of 93% of the river&#x27;s flow is diverted by the compensating works to power generation and navigational uses.

Because all of the other gates are periodically closed, totally dewatering the rapids, a concrete berm was constructed in 1985 along the north side of the rapids south of Whitefish Island as remedial works to protect fish spawning habitat from lower outflow through the rapids due to the operation of the compensation works. The berm begins at Gate #1 of the compensating works so as to retain the ability to provide a dedicated flow over the fish spawning habitat, independent of water supply over the rest of the rapids.

== Pollution ==
The Saint Marys River is listed as a Great Lakes Areas of Concern in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the United States and Canada.

<text>Traffic signs or road signs are signs erected at the side of or above roads to give instructions or provide information to road users. The earliest signs were simple wooden or stone milestones. Later, signs with directional arms were introduced, for example the fingerposts in the United Kingdom and their wooden counterparts in Saxony.

With traffic volumes increasing since the 1930s, many countries have adopted pictorial signs or otherwise simplified and standardized their signs to overcome language barriers, and enhance traffic safety. Such pictorial signs use symbols (often silhouettes) in place of words and are usually based on international protocols. Such signs were first developed in Europe, and have been adopted by most countries to varying degrees.

==International conventions==
International conventions such as Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals and Geneva Convention on Road Traffic have helped to achieve a degree of uniformity in traffic signing in various countries. Countries have also unilaterally (to some extent) followed other countries in order to avoid confusion.

==Categories==
Traffic signs can be grouped into several types. For example, Annexe 1 of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (1968), which on 30 June 2004 had 52 signatory countries, defines eight categories of signs:

* A. Danger warning signs
* B. Priority signs
* C. Prohibitory or restrictive signs
* D. Mandatory signs
* E. Special regulation signs
* F. Information, facilities, or service signs
* G. Direction, position, or indication signs
* H. Additional panels

In the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand signs are categorized as follows:
* Regulatory signs
* Warning signs
* Guide signs
** Street name signs
** Route marker signs
** Expressway signs
** Freeway signs
** Welcome signs
** Informational signs
** Recreation and cultural interest signs
* Emergency management (civil defense) signs
* Temporary traffic control (construction or work zone) signs
* School signs
* Railroad and light rail signs
* Bicycle signs

In the United States, the categories, placement, and graphic standards for traffic signs and pavement markings are legally defined in the Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; as the standard.

A rather informal distinction among the directional signs is the one between advance directional signs, interchange directional signs, and reassurance signs. Advance directional signs appear at a certain distance from the interchange, giving information for each direction. A number of countries do not give information for the road ahead (so-called &quot;pull-through&quot; signs), and only for the directions left and right. Advance directional signs enable drivers to take precautions for the exit (e.g., switch lanes, double check whether this is the correct exit, slow down).
They often do not appear on lesser roads, but are normally posted on expressways and motorways, as drivers would be missing exits without them. While each nation has its own system, the first approach sign for a motorway exit is mostly placed at least from the actual interchange. After that sign, one or two additional advance directional signs typically follow before the actual interchange itself.

==History==

The earliest road signs were milestones, giving distance or direction; for example, the Romans erected stone columns throughout their empire giving the distance to Rome. According to Strabo, Mauryas erected signboards at distance of 10 stades to mark their roads. In the Middle Ages, multidirectional signs at intersections became common, giving directions to cities and towns.

In 1686, the first known Traffic Regulation Act in Europe was established by King Peter II of Portugal. This act foresaw the placement of priority signs in the narrowest streets of Lisbon, stating which traffic should back up to give way. One of these signs still exists at Salvador street, in the neighborhood of Alfama.

The first modern road signs erected on a wide scale were designed for riders of high or &quot;ordinary&quot; bicycles in the late 1870s and early 1880s. These machines were fast, silent and their nature made them difficult to control, moreover their riders travelled considerable distances and often preferred to tour on unfamiliar roads. For such riders, cycling organizations began to erect signs that warned of potential hazards ahead (particularly steep hills), rather than merely giving distance or directions to places, thereby contributing the sign type that defines &quot;modern&quot; traffic signs.

The development of automobiles encouraged more complex signage systems using more than just text-based notices. One of the first modern-day road sign systems was devised by the Italian Touring Club in 1895. By 1900, a Congress of the International League of Touring Organizations in Paris was considering proposals for standardization of road signage. In 1903 the British government introduced four &quot;national&quot; signs based on shape, but the basic patterns of most traffic signs were set at the 1908 World Road Congress in Paris. In 1909, nine European governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating &quot;bump&quot;, &quot;curve&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, and &quot;grade-level railroad crossing&quot;. The intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system. Both Britain and the United States developed their own road signage systems, both of which were adopted or modified by many other nations in their respective spheres of influence. The UK adopted a version of the European road signs in 1964 and, over past decades, North American signage began using some symbols and graphics mixed in with English.

In the U.S., the first road signs were erected by the American Automobile Association (AAA). Starting in 1906, regional AAA clubs began paying for and installing wooden signs to help motorists find their way. In 1914, AAA started a cohesive transcontinental signage project, installing more than 4,000 signs in one stretch between Los Angeles and Kansas City alone.

Over the years, change was gradual. Pre-industrial signs were stone or wood, but with the development of Darby&#x27;s method of smelting iron using coke-painted cast iron became favoured in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Cast iron continued to be used until the mid-20th century, but it was gradually displaced by aluminium or other materials and processes, such as vitreous enamelled and/or pressed malleable iron, or (later) steel. Since 1945 most signs have been made from sheet aluminium with adhesive plastic coatings; these are normally retroreflective for nighttime and low-light visibility. Before the development of reflective plastics, reflectivity was provided by glass reflectors set into the lettering and symbols.

New generations of traffic signs based on electronic displays can also change their text (or, in some countries, symbols) to provide for &quot;intelligent control&quot; linked to automated traffic sensors or remote manual input. In over 20 countries, real-time Traffic Message Channel incident warnings are conveyed directly to vehicle navigation systems using inaudible signals carried via FM radio, 3G cellular data and satellite broadcasts. Finally, cars can pay tolls and trucks pass safety screening checks using video numberplate scanning, or RFID transponders in windshields linked to antennae over the road, in support of on-board signalling, toll collection, and travel time monitoring.

Yet another &quot;medium&quot; for transferring information ordinarily associated with visible signs is RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage), e.g., &quot;talking signs&quot; for print-handicapped (including blind/low-vision/illiterate) people. These are infra-red transmitters serving the same purpose as the usual graphic signs when received by an appropriate device such as a hand-held receiver or one built into a cell phone.

Then, finally, in 1914, the world&#x27;s first electric traffic signal is put into place on the corner of Euclid Avenue and East 105th Street in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 5.

== Typefaces ==

Typefaces used on traffic signs vary by location, with some typefaces being designed specifically for the purpose of being used on traffic signs and based on attributes that aid viewing from a distance. A typeface chosen for a traffic sign is selected based on its readability, which is essential for conveying information to drivers quickly and accurately at high speeds and long distances.

Factors such as clear letterforms, lines of copy, appropriate spacing, and simplicity contribute to readability. Increased X-height and counters specifically help with letter distinction and reduced halation, which especially affects aging drivers. In cases of halation, certain letters can blur and look like others, such as a lowercase &quot;e&quot; appearing as an &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, or &quot;o&quot;.

===Dispute of standard typefaces for North American traffic signs===

In 1997, a design team at T.D. Larson Transportation Institute began testing Clearview, a typeface designed to improve readability and halation issues with the FHWA Standard Alphabet, also known as Highway Gothic, which is the standard typeface for highway signs in the U.S.

The adoption of Clearview for traffic signs over Highway Gothic has been slow since its initial proposal. Country-wide adoption faced resistance from both local governments and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), citing concerns about consistency and cost, along with doubts of the studies done on Clearview’s improved readability. As stated by the FHWA, &quot;This process (of designing Clearview) did not result in a necessarily better set of letter styles for highway signing, but rather a different set of letter styles with increased letter height and different letter spacing that was not comparable to the Standard Alphabets.&quot;

The FHWA allowed use of Clearview to be approved on an interim basis as opposed to national change, where local governments could decide to submit a request to the FHWA for approval to update their signs with Clearview, but in 2016 they rescinded this approval, wanting to limit confusion and inconsistency that could come from a mix of two typefaces being used. In 2018, they again allowed interim approval of Clearview, with Highway Gothic remaining the standard.

==Automatic traffic sign recognition==
Cars are beginning to feature cameras with automatic traffic sign recognition, beginning 2008 with the Opel Insignia. It mainly recognizes speed limits and no-overtaking areas. It also uses GPS and a database over speed limits, which is useful in the many countries which signpost city speed limits with a city name sign, not a speed limit sign.

==Rail traffic==
Rail traffic has often a lot of differences between countries and often not much similarity with road signs. Rail traffic has professional drivers who have much longer education than what&#x27;s normal for road driving licenses. Differences between neighboring countries cause problems for cross border traffic and causes need for additional education for drivers.

<text>Marcia Lynne &quot;Marcheline&quot; Bertrand (May 9, 1950 – January 27, 2007) was an American actress who was the former wife of actor Jon Voight and the mother of actress Angelina Jolie and actor James Haven.

== Early life ==
Bertrand was born in Blue Island, Illinois, the daughter of Lois June (Gouwens) and Rolland F. Bertrand. She was of French-Canadian, Dutch and German descent. She had a younger sister, Debbie, and a younger brother, Raleigh. In 1965, Bertrand&#x27;s family moved from the Chicago area to Beverly Hills, California, where she attended Beverly Hills High School from sophomore year until graduation.

== Film career ==
During her early years as an actress, Bertrand studied with Lee Strasberg. In 1971, she played Connie in the episode &quot;Love, Peace, Brotherhood, and Murder&quot; on the fourth season of the television show &quot;Ironside&quot;. A decade later, she appeared in a minor role in 1982&#x27;s &quot;Lookin&#x27; to Get Out&quot;, a film co-written by and starring her former husband, Jon Voight. The following year, Bertrand played her final film role in the 1983 comedy &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot;, a remake of the 1977 French film of the same name.

Bertrand then turned her attention toward producing. In 1983, she founded Woods Road Productions with her then-partner, Bill Day. In 2005, Bertrand was the executive producer of the documentary &quot;Trudell&quot;, which chronicles the life and work of her partner, John Trudell, a Santee Sioux musician and activist. &quot;Trudell&quot; was an official selection at the Sundance Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival, and it won the Special Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Seattle International Film Festival.

== Humanitarian work ==
Bertrand and her partner John Trudell founded the All Tribes Foundation to support the cultural and economic survival of Native peoples. By 2007, the foundation had issued over $800,000 in grants to reservation-based programs that strengthen tribal ways of life and safeguard a future for Native communities.

On International Women&#x27;s Day in 2003, Bertrand and Trudell produced a benefit concert for Afghan women refugees in conjunction with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Bertrand, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1999, also founded the Give Love Give Life organization with Trudell; their objective was to raise public consciousness about ovarian and other gynecological cancers through music. The first Give Love Give Life concert was held in February 2004 at The Roxy in West Hollywood. Bertrand and Trudell worked to organize strategic support in the music and film community for Johanna&#x27;s Law, legislation to fund national outreach and education about the signs and symptoms of gynecological cancers, which was signed into law on January 12, 2007. To benefit the Women&#x27;s Cancer Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a second Give Love Give Life concert was held at the Gibson Amphitheater in Los Angeles in February 2007, a month after Bertrand died from cancer.

== Personal life ==
Bertrand married actor Jon Voight on December 12, 1971. Following a miscarriage in 1972, they had two children, James Haven and Angelina Jolie, both of whom became actors. Bertrand and Voight separated in 1976, publicly citing Voight&#x27;s adultery. Bertrand filed for divorce in 1978, which was finalized in 1980.

Following her legal separation from Voight, Bertrand began a relationship with documentary filmmaker Bill Day. They lived together for 11 years but never married. During her later life, Bertrand was in a relationship with activist and musician John Trudell.

At the time of her death, Bertrand had four grandchildren by her daughter. Another granddaughter, who was born the following year, was given the middle name &quot;Marcheline&quot; in her honor.

Bertrand was a Roman Catholic.

== Death ==
Toward the end of her life, Bertrand preferred her privacy and did not grant interviews. After a nearly eight-year battle with ovarian and breast cancer, she died aged 56 on January 27, 2007, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in the company of her children. Bertrand&#x27;s mother and sister also died of cancer. Her daughter explained, &quot;My grandmother also died young; so, my mother always thought it could happen to her.&quot;

<text>Selma Blair (born Selma Blair Beitner on June 23, 1972) is an American actress. She is known for her roles in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot;, and the &quot;Hellboy&quot; franchise.

Blair, born in Southfield, Michigan, emerged from a background in legal and political involvement: both her parents were lawyers and her father active in the U.S. Democratic Party. Blair&#x27;s upbringing was predominantly Jewish. She initially pursued photography at Kalamazoo College before moving to New York to become involved in the arts, graduating from the University of Michigan. Blair&#x27;s early career was marked by numerous auditions to land her first roles in television and film, with her breakthrough in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; and subsequent mainstream success in projects like &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; and &quot;Hellboy&quot;.

Blair&#x27;s personal life include her marriage to Ahmet Zappa and subsequent relationships and motherhood. After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2018, she has shared her experience with the condition, contributing to her advocacy work. In 2021, Blair starred in &quot;Introducing, Selma Blair&quot;, a documentary about her life since being diagnosed with MS. Her autobiography, &quot;Mean Baby: A Memoir of Growing Up&quot;, was published by Knopf in 2022.

==Early life==
Selma Blair Beitner was born on June 23, 1972, in the Detroit suburb of Southfield, Michigan, the youngest of four daughters of Molly Ann (&quot;née&quot; Cooke) and Elliot I. Beitner. Her maternal grandfather was the founder of Penn Fruit and she spent a great deal of her childhood in Philadelphia. Both of her parents were lawyers; her father was a labor arbitrator and was active in the U.S. Democratic Party until his death in 2012; her mother died in 2020. Her parents divorced when Blair was 23. Selma and her sister Elizabeth officially changed their surname to &#x27;Blair&#x27;; in her memoir, Blair wrote that, following a concerted effort on the part of her father&#x27;s girlfriend to derail her career, she did not speak to her father for 12 years.

Blair&#x27;s father and maternal grandfather were Jewish; her Scottish maternal grandmother, and her mother, were Anglican but Selma and her sisters had a Jewish upbringing and Selma formally converted to Judaism in the second grade; her Hebrew name is &#x27;Bat-Sheva&#x27;. Blair attended Hillel Day School in Farmington Hills, and Cranbrook Kingswood in Bloomfield Hills. She then spent two years (1990–1992) studying photography at Kalamazoo College.

At age 21, Blair moved to New York City, where she lived at The Salvation Army. Intending to become a photographer, she attended New York University (NYU), and took acting classes at the Stella Adler Conservatory, the Column Theater, and Stonestreet Studios. She returned to Michigan, transferred from NYU to the University of Michigan and, in 1994, graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; with a triple major in photography, psychology, and English. She then returned to New York City to pursue a career in the arts.

==Career==

===1990–1998: Career beginning===
In 1990, during her time at Cranbrook Kingswood, Blair was involved in a production of T.S. Eliot’s &quot;Murder in the Cathedral&quot;. She considered it a failure, but her English teacher told her not to give up; that was the first time she thought she could be an actress. In 1993 in New York, an agent discovered her in an acting class and Blair signed with her. After 75 auditions, Blair got her first advertising job, a TV ad for the Theater of Virginia.

Blair won her first professional role in a 1995 episode of the children&#x27;s sitcom &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;. In 1996, she landed her first feature film role in the comedy &quot;The Broccoli Theory&quot;. In 1997, she made her first appearance in a mainstream feature film, the comedy &quot;In &amp; Out&quot;. She auditioned six times for the role and remained on-set for several weeks, but most of her scenes were cut from the film&#x27;s final version. 

Her first lead role was in the film &quot;Strong Island Boys&quot;. She then won the lead in the 1997 fantasy film &quot;Amazon High&quot;. The film, which was proposed as a third show set in the Hercules and Xena mythological genre, did not air, but portions of it were used in the 2000 &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Lifeblood&quot;. She was considered for the role of Joey Potter in &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, a role which ultimately went to Katie Holmes. She subsequently appeared in several independent and short productions, including the award-winning &quot;Debutante&quot;.

===1999–2004: Breakthrough and mainstream success===
Blair achieved her breakthrough in the 1999 coming-of-age drama &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;. It received mixed reviews, with &quot;Variety&quot; finding &quot;newcomer&quot; Blair &quot;too broad&quot; and &quot;overdoing [her role]&#x27;s clumsiness&quot;. The film made US$75.9 million internationally and brought Blair a nomination for the MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance, and a win for &quot;Best Kiss&quot;, shared with co-star Sarah Michelle Gellar. &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; has since developed a cult following.

In 1999, Blair starred as Zoe Bean on &quot;Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane&quot;, and was nominated for the Teen Choice Awards for &quot;TV – Breakout Performance&quot;. In 2000, following her performance in the teen comedy &quot;Down to You&quot;, Blair won the Young Hollywood Award for &quot;Exciting New Face&quot;. In 2000 and 2002, Blair was included in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Next Wave of Stars&quot; issues. 

Blair co-starred in the 2001 hit comedy &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;, portraying a preppy, snobby law student; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found her to be a &quot;strong presence&quot; in her role. The film topped the US box office in its opening weekend; it grossed US$96.5 million in North America and US$141.7 million worldwide. She next starred as a college student having an affair with her professor in the 2001 independent drama &quot;Storytelling&quot;. It premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival; &quot;SPLICEDwire&quot; cited Blair and co-star Leo Fitzpatrick for &quot;painfully authentic performances as an emotionally insecure coed and her cerebral palsy-stricken dorm neighbor and lover&quot;. In its review, &quot;View Auckland&quot; noted: &quot;The acting, throughout, is excellent, with Selma Blair giving a mature performance that suggests better roles await her than those she&#x27;s had so far.&quot; Blair next appeared in the 2002 comedy &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot;. While the film was generally panned, it grossed US$68.6 million worldwide. Blair appeared with her co-starts from the film on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy for her work in the film.

In 2004, Blair took on the role of Liz Sherman, a depressed pyrokinetic superhero, in Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s blockbuster fantasy film &quot;Hellboy&quot;, co-starring Ron Perlman. Based on Mike Mignola&#x27;s popular comic book series, the film was favorably received by critics; &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked: &quot;Blair&#x27;s heavy-lidded eyes seem to be at half mast from some lovely lewd fantasy. With her sleepy carnality and dry, hesitant timing, she is a superb foil for Mr. Perlman&#x27;s plain-spoken bravado.&quot; &quot;Hellboy&quot; topped the box office in the U.S. and Canada in its opening weekend, and ultimately grossed US$99.3 million.

Also in 2004, Blair played the role of an exhibitionist dancer in John Waters&#x27; satirical sex comedy &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot;, alongside Tracey Ullman. The film received a mixed response; &quot;A.V. Club&quot; described the production as a &quot;proud retreat back into the sandbox of sexual juvenilia&quot; and a &quot;potty-mouthed manifesto from an elder statesman of shock&quot;, while pointing out that Blair and Ullman &quot;throw themselves headfirst into the insanity, reveling in the forfeiture of dignity, self-respect, and self-consciousness their roles demand&quot;. Blair also took part on the social project &quot;The 1 Second Film&quot; as a producer, and was included on the &quot;FHM&quot; list of &quot;The 100 Sexiest Women of 2004&quot;.

===2005–2011: Independent films and &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;===

From 2005 to 2007, Blair appeared in a string of independent films. In 2008, she reprised her role of Liz Sherman in &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;, where her character had a larger role than its predecessor. The film garnered largely positive reviews from critics and became a worldwide commercial success, grossing US$160 million. Blair was nominated for the Scream Awards for Best Actress in a Fantasy Movie or TV Show.
In 2008, Blair starred as a drug-addicted and alcoholic mother in Lori Petty&#x27;s independent drama &quot;The Poker House&quot;. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; considering Blair&#x27;s performance one her best. 

Also in 2008, Blair accepted the titular role on the NBC sitcom &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;. The sitcom, which was based on the Australian television series of the same name, was canceled after one season. 

In 2009, Blair returned to the stage, when she took on the lead role of Kayleen in Rajiv Joseph&#x27;s &quot;Gruesome Playground Injuries&quot;. In 2010, Blair she lent her voice to narrate the audiobook of &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition&quot;, originally written by Holocaust victim Anne Frank. Her performance received a 2011 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children nomination.

===2012–present: Film and television===
In 2012, Blair returned to television as the female lead with the premiere of FX&#x27;s &quot;Anger Management&quot;, co-starring Charlie Sheen. She starred in 53 episodes as Dr. Kate Wales, Sheen&#x27;s neurotic therapist and love interest. The series premiered to mixed critical reviews, but broke ratings records with 5.74 million viewers in its debut and ranks as the most-watched sitcom premiere in cable history. Blair left the show in June 2013, during the shooting of the second season, due to disagreements with Sheen, who fired her via text message.

In 2012, Blair narrated Xfinity TV commercials, including the London 2012 Olympics ads. In 2014, she obtained her first television role since &quot;Anger Management&quot; when she was cast as Joanna in the Amazon&#x27;s comedy pilot &quot;Really&quot;. The pilot was not picked up but, in February 2016, Blair co-starred in the FX miniseries &quot;American Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson&quot;.

In October 2012, Blair starred in the political satire sketch &quot;The Woman for Romney&quot;, about the campaign proposals of Mitt Romney, former Republican Party nominee for the 2012 United States presidential election. 

In 2018, Blair was cast in a recurring role on the Netflix science-fiction drama series &quot;Another Life&quot;; it ran from 2019 to 2021 before being canceled.

In September 2022, Blair became a contestant on season 31 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; but left in the fifth week of the competition because of her deteriorating health. 

Her next film role is in the Israeli project, &quot;Be Strong&quot; by Doron Eran. The film focuses on Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim, and Samer Talalka, three Israeli men taken hostage by Hamas during the October 7 attack on Israel. They were mistakenly identified as a threat by Israeli soldiers during fighting in northern Gaza and killed. The film went into production in late 2024, with filming taking place in Georgia.

==Fashion==
Blair is known for her fashion-forward style, and for her frequent radical hairstyle changes. She lent her image to the Marc Jacobs-Brian Bowen Smith clothing line, and has worked with several other fashion designers, including Karen Zambos, Martin Margiela, Isaac Mizrahi, Reinaldo Herrera, and Stella McCartney.

She was featured in the 2002 Pirelli Calendar, and, in 2005, appeared in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; award-winning photography gallery, &quot;The Selma Blair Witch Project: Fall&#x27;s Dark Silhouettes Have a Way of Creeping Up on You&quot; by the art photographer Roger Ballen, at the Palau Robert in Barcelona in 2012.

Blair also appeared with Rainn Wilson singing &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; for the 2008 Gap winter ad campaign, and was included in &quot;Glamour&#x27;s&quot; list of the 50 Most Glamorous Women of 2008.

In 2010, Blair posed with Demi Moore and Amanda De Cadenet for a spread in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine. In 2012, she became the spokesperson for, and first actress to appear on, the &quot;Get Real For Kids&quot; campaign. In the spring of that year, she released &quot;SB,&quot; a line of handbags and wallets which she designed.

She has appeared on covers and photo spreads of other magazines, including &quot;CR Fashion Book&quot; magazine in February 2016. In 1999, she appeared in &quot;Seventeen&quot;, and in subsequent years, in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The Lab Magazine&quot;, &quot;Interview&quot;, &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot;, &quot;Hunger&quot;, and &quot;Elle&quot;. She has been the face of fashion houses Chanel, Miu Miu and GAP. She presented parts of the collection of Christian Siriano at a celebration of his 10th stage anniversary at Masonic Hall during New York Fashion Week 2018. In 2020, she appeared as a judge on a &quot;Project Runway&quot; special.

==Personal life==

On January 24, 2004, Blair married writer and producer Ahmet Zappa at Carrie Fisher&#x27;s mansion in Beverly Hills, California. They lived in Los Angeles in a 1920s-era home they bought for $1.35 million. She filed for divorce from Zappa on June 21, 2006, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences.&quot; The divorce became final in December 2006.

Blair has dated actors Jason Schwartzman and David Lyons and, from 2008 to 2010, dated her &quot;Kath and Kim&quot; co-star Mikey Day.

In 2010, Blair began dating fashion designer Jason Bleick; they have a son, Arthur Saint Bleick. In September 2012, they announced that they had separated.

In 2022, Blair and her ex-boyfriend, filmmaker Ron Carlson, whom she had been seeing since 2017, requested temporary restraining orders against each other, with both claiming physical abuse. The order requests were mutually dismissed.

===Health===

In October 2018, Blair revealed that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in August of that year. In a 2023 interview with &quot;British Vogue&quot;, Blair said that her symptoms had begun to manifest themselves when she was a child, and that her un-diagnosed MS had caused brain damage. As the condition worsened, she was heavily medicated, developed a dependency on alcohol and attempted suicide. She was inspired to reveal the news as a way to thank Allisa Swanson, her costume designer, who had become her unofficial &quot;dresser&quot; for her role in the Netflix series &quot;Another Life&quot;, saying that Swanson &quot;gets my legs in my pants, pulls my tops over my head, (and) buttons my coats.&quot; Blair wrote about her experiences with multiple sclerosis in her memoir, &quot;Mean Baby: A Memoir of Growing Up&quot;, which was published in May 2022.

===Advocacy===

On May 27, 2012, Blair was a special guest at the National Memorial Day Concert at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC. She presented the story of Brigette Cain, a war widow who lost her husband (Pfc. Norman L. Cain III) in Afghanistan.

Blair supported Marianne Williamson for the 2014 congressional elections.

Blair&#x27;s charity work and philanthropic causes include Marc Jacobs&#x27; Skin Cancer Awareness Campaign, H&amp;M&#x27;s Fashion Against AIDS 2011 Campaign, Children&#x27;s Action Network, AmFAR AIDS Research 2011, Lange Foundation (dedicated to saving homeless and abandoned animals), Bulgari-Save the Children 2012 Ad Campaign, No Kid Hungry, Staying Alive Foundation and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. On October 2, 2015, she received the Universal Smile Award during THE SMILE GALA LA 2015 to benefit children with cleft lip and palate. She was included as one of the Silence Breakers selected as the 2017 &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year. In December 2021, Michelle Pfeiffer presented Blair with the Equity in Entertainment Award at the Power 100 Women ceremony. 

In June 2022, Blair became chief creative officer of Guide Beauty, a company which creates cosmetic products for those with mobility challenges. In December 2022 she was chosen as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women.

===Views on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
In May 2021, during the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, Blair signed an open letter by the Creative Community for Peace calling for &quot;peace, balanced discourse and an end to inflammatory one-sided accounts&quot; of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

In October 2023, Blair expressed support for Israel in the Israel-Hamas war. In February 2024, Blair made a comment, later deleted, on an Instagram video related to the war, commenting, &quot;Deport all these terrorist supporting goons. Islam has destroyed Muslim countries and then they come here and destroyed minds. They know they are liars. Twisted justifications. May they meet their fate.&quot; The comment was criticized as Islamophobic, prompting Blair to delete it and issue a statement apologizing for her remarks.

In September 2024, Blair again expressed support for Israel and the hostages taken by Hamas, and said that Gaza was being run by &quot;Jihadists, the radicals, the extreme&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;.

<doc id="261019" wikidata="Q51628" url="?curid=261019" title="Nativity of Jesus">
<text>The Nativity or birth of Jesus Christ is found in the biblical gospels of Matthew and Luke. The two accounts agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in Roman-controlled Palestine, that his mother, Mary, was engaged to a man named Joseph, who was descended from King David and was not his biological father, and that his birth was caused by divine intervention. The majority of contemporary scholars do not see the two canonical gospel Nativity stories as historically factual since they present clashing accounts and irreconcilable genealogies. The secular history of the time does not synchronize with the narratives of the birth and early childhood of Jesus in the two gospels. Some view the question of historicity as secondary, given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than chronological timelines.

The Nativity is the basis for the Christian holiday of Christmas and plays a major role in the Christian liturgical year. Many Christians traditionally display small manger scenes depicting the Nativity within or outside of their homes, or attend Nativity plays or Christmas pageants focusing on the Nativity cycle in the Bible. Elaborate Nativity displays featuring life-sized statues are a tradition in many continental European countries during the Christmas season.

The artistic depiction of the Nativity has been an important subject for Christian artists since the 4th century. Artistic depictions of the Nativity scene since the 13th century have emphasized the humility of Jesus and promoted a more tender image of him, a major change from the early &quot;Lord and Master&quot; image, mirroring changes in the common approaches taken by Christian pastoral ministry during the same era.

==Gospel accounts==
Only the Gospels of Matthew and Luke offer narratives regarding the birth of Jesus. Both agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem in the reign of King Herod, that his mother was named Mary and that her husband Joseph was descended from King David (although they disagree on details of the line of descent), and both deny Joseph&#x27;s biological parenthood while treating the birth, or rather the conception, as divinely effected.
Beyond this, they agree on very little. Joseph dominates Matthew&#x27;s and Mary dominates Luke&#x27;s, although the suggestion that one derives from Joseph and the other from Mary is no more than a pious deduction. 
Matthew implies that Joseph already has his home in Bethlehem, while Luke states that he lived in Nazareth.
In Matthew the angel speaks to Joseph, while Luke has one speaking to Mary. Only Luke has the stories surrounding the birth of John the Baptist, the census of Quirinius, the adoration of the shepherds and the presentation in the Temple on the eighth day; only Matthew has the wise men, the star of Bethlehem, Herod&#x27;s plot, the massacre of the innocents, and the flight into Egypt. The two itineraries are quite different. According to Matthew, the Holy Family begins in Bethlehem, moves to Egypt following the birth, and settles in Nazareth, while according to Luke they begin in Nazareth, journey to Bethlehem for the birth, and immediately return to Nazareth. The two accounts cannot be harmonised into a single coherent narrative or traced to the same Q source, leading scholars to classify them as &quot;special Matthew&quot; (or simply the M source) and &quot;special Luke&quot; (the L source).


==Gospel of Matthew==
===Annunciation to Joseph===
Mary, the mother of Jesus, was betrothed to Joseph, but was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Joseph intended to divorce her quietly, but an angel told him in a dream that he should take her as his wife and name the child Jesus, &quot;because it is he who will save his people from their sins&quot;. This would fulfil the prophecy that a virgin would give birth to a son, who would be known as Emmanuel, meaning &quot;God is with us&quot;. Joseph awoke, took Mary for his wife, did not have intercourse with her until she had given birth to a son, and gave him the name Jesus (Matthew 1:18–25).

Joseph has been shown to be the descendant of David (the angel addresses him as &quot;son of David&quot;) and heir to the kingdom of Judah, but Matthew 1:16 reveals that Jesus is not Joseph&#x27;s son, and Matthew is careful never to refer to him in this way. The role of Joseph in naming the child indicates that he is being legally adopted, and thus becoming, like his now-legal father, &quot;son of David.&quot;

===Adoration of the magi===
The birth took place in the town of Bethlehem in the region known as Judea to the Romans and Judah to the Assyrians, in the time of King Herod (Herod the Great). Wise men from the East (the Magi) came to Jerusalem, asking where they could find the child born king of the Jews, for they had seen his star at its rising, and wished to pay him homage. Herod and all Jerusalem were afraid when they heard this, but Herod, learning from the chief priests and scribes that the messiah would be born in Bethlehem according to prophecy, sent the Magi there with instructions to return and tell him when they had found him. The Magi worshipped the child in Bethlehem and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, but an angel warned them in a dream not to return to Herod, and they returned home by another way.

===Massacre of the innocents, flight into Egypt, and return to Israel===
When Herod learned that the Magi had tricked him, he was infuriated and killed all the children in and around Bethlehem under the age of two (the Massacre of the Innocents). This was in fulfilment of the prophet Jeremiah: &quot;A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more.&quot; But an angel had appeared to Joseph in a dream and warned him to take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and the Holy Family remained there until Herod died to fulfil the words of the prophet, &quot;Out of Egypt I have called my son.&quot; On the death of Herod an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and told him to return with the child and its mother to Israel, but Herod&#x27;s son was now ruler of Judea, and after being warned in a dream Joseph went instead to Galilee, where he made his home in Nazareth &quot;so that what had been spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, &quot;He will be called a Nazorean.&quot;&quot;

In this chapter, the author of Matthew needs to establish that &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; was in fact born in Bethlehem, the town where David was born, for the &quot;son of David&quot; born there will be &quot;King of the Jews&quot; (a designation that does not reappear in Matthew until the crucifixion). Herod&#x27;s fear and the visit of the Magi underline the royal birth, as do the various prophetic texts quoted or referenced in this chapter.

==Gospel of Luke==

In the Gospel of Luke, when Herod was king of Judea, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee to announce to a virgin named Mary, who was betrothed to a man named Joseph, that a child would be born to her. The angel Gabriel announced that she was to name him Jesus, for he would be the son of God and rule over Israel forever. When the time of the birth drew near, Caesar Augustus commanded a census of Roman domains, and Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem, the ancient city of David, as he was of the House of David. Jesus was born in Bethlehem; since there was nowhere for them to stay in the town, the infant was laid in a manger while angels announced his birth to a group of shepherds who worshipped him as Messiah and Lord.

In accordance with the Jewish law, his parents presented the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem, where two people in the temple, Simeon and Anna the Prophetess, gave thanks to God who had sent his salvation. Joseph and Mary then returned to Nazareth.

==Date and place of birth==


Matthew and Luke agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem during the reign of Herod the Great. In Luke the newborn baby is placed in a manger &quot;because there was no place in the &quot;. might mean a private home (this has little support among scholars), or a room in a private home, or an inn, but it is impossible to be certain which is meant.

In the 2nd century, Justin Martyr stated that Jesus had been born in a cave outside the town, while the Protoevangelium of James described a legendary birth in a cave nearby. The Church of the Nativity inside the town, built by St. Helena, contains the cave-manger site traditionally venerated as the birthplace of Jesus, which may have originally been a site of the cult of the god Tammuz. In his (1.51), Origen, who travelled throughout Palestine beginning in around 215, wrote of the &quot;manger of Jesus&quot;.

The date of birth for Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but basing it on the death of Herod would place the date between 6 BC and 4 BC. The historical evidence is too ambiguous to allow a definitive date to be determined, but dates have been estimated through known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts, by working backwards from the estimated start of the ministry of Jesus, or by associating the claimed astrological portents mentioned with actual historical astronomical alignments and phenomena.

==Themes and analogies==

===Thematic analysis===
Helmut Koester writes that while Matthew&#x27;s narrative was formed in a Jewish environment, Luke&#x27;s was modeled to appeal to the Greco-Roman world. In particular, while shepherds were regarded negatively by Jews in Jesus&#x27; time, they were seen in Greco-Roman culture as &quot;symbols of a golden age when gods and humans lived in peace and nature was at harmony&quot;. C. T. Ruddick Jr. writes that Luke&#x27;s birth narratives of Jesus and John were modeled on passages from Genesis, chapters 27–43. Regardless, Luke&#x27;s Nativity depicts Jesus as a savior for all people, tracing a genealogy all the way back to Adam, demonstrating his common humanity, and likewise for the lowly circumstances of his birth. Luke, writing for a gentile audience, portrays the infant Jesus as a savior for gentiles as well as Jews. Matthew uses quotations from Jewish scripture, scenes reminiscent of Moses&#x27; life, and a numerical pattern in his genealogy to identify Jesus as a son of David, of Abraham, and of God. Luke&#x27;s prelude is much longer, emphasizing the age of the Holy Spirit and the arrival of a savior for all people, both Jew and gentile.

Mainstream scholars interpret Matthew&#x27;s Nativity as depicting Jesus as a new Moses with a genealogy going back to Abraham, while Ulrich Luz views Matthew&#x27;s depiction of Jesus at once as the new Moses and the inverse of Moses, and not simply a retelling of the Moses story. Luz also points out that in the massacre narrative, once again, a fulfilment quotation is given: Rachel, the ancestral mother of Israel, weeping for her dead children (Matthew 2:18).

Scholars who interpret Matthew as casting Jesus in the role of being a second Moses argue that, like Moses, the infant Jesus is saved from a murderous tyrant; and he flees the country of his birth until his persecutor is dead and it is safe to return as the savior of his people. In this view, the account in Matthew is based on an earlier narrative patterned on traditions about the birth of Moses. Moses&#x27; birth is announced to Pharaoh by Magi; the child is threatened and rescued; the male Israelite children are similarly put to death by an evil king.

According to Ulrich Luz, the beginning of the narrative of Matthew is similar to earlier biblical stories, e.g., the Annunciation of Jesus&#x27; birth (Matthew 1:18–25) is reminiscent of the biblical accounts of the births of Ishmael (Genesis 16:11, Genesis 17), Isaac (Genesis 21:1), Samson (Judges 13:3, 13:5), and recalls the Haggadic traditions of the birth of Moses. Yet in Luz&#x27;s view, the contours appear, in part, strangely overlapped and inverted: &quot;Egypt, formerly the land of suppression becomes a place of refuge and it is the King of Israel who now takes on the role of Pharaoh. Yet Matthew is not simply retelling the Moses story. Instead, the story of Jesus really is a new story: Jesus is at once the new Moses and the inverse of Moses.&quot;

===Old Testament parallels===

Scholars have debated whether Matthew 1:22 and Matthew 2:23 refer to specific Old Testament passages. Fourth century documents such as the Codex Sinaiticus do not mention the prophet Isaiah in the statement in Matthew 1:22: &quot;All this happened to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet&quot;, but some copies of Matthew from the 5th–6th centuries, such as the Codex Bezae, read &quot;Isaiah the prophet&quot;. The statement in Matthew 1:23, &quot;Behold the virgin shall be with child&quot;, uses the Greek term (&quot;virgin&quot;) as in the Septuagint Isaiah, while the Book of Isaiah 7:14 uses the Hebrew , which may mean &quot;maiden&quot;, &quot;young woman&quot;, or &quot;virgin&quot;. Raymond E. Brown states that the 3rd century BC translators of the Septuagint may have understood the Hebrew word to mean &quot;virgin&quot; in this context.

The statement in Matthew 2:23 that &quot;he will be called a Nazarene&quot; does not mention a specific passage in the Old Testament, and there are multiple scholarly interpretations as to what it may refer to. Barbara Aland and other scholars consider the Greek used for &#x27;Nazarene&#x27; of uncertain etymology and meaning, but Menken states that it is a demonym that refers to an &quot;inhabitant of Nazareth&quot;. Menken also states that it may be referring to Judges 13:5 and 13:7. Gary Smith states that Nazirite may mean one consecrated to God, i.e. an ascetic; or may refer to Isaiah 11:1. &quot;The Oxford Bible Commentary&quot; states that it may be word-play on the use of &quot;nazirite&quot;, &quot;Holy One of God,&quot; in Isaiah 4:3, meant to identify Jesus with the Nazarenes, a Jewish sect who differed from the Pharisees only in that they regarded Jesus as the Messiah. The Swiss theologian Ulrich Luz, who locates the Matthean community in Syria, has noted that Syrian Christians also called themselves Nazarenes.

==Christian theology==

The theological significance of the Nativity of Jesus has been a key element in Christian teachings, from the early Church Fathers to 20th century theologians. The theological issues were addressed as early as Apostle Paul, but continued to be debated and eventually led to both Christological and Mariological differences among Christians that resulted in early schisms within the Church by the 5th century.

===Birth of the new man===


Paul the Apostle viewed the birth of Jesus as an event of cosmic significance which brought forth a &quot;new man&quot; who undid the damage caused by the fall of the first man, Adam. Just as the Johannine view of Jesus as the incarnate Logos proclaims the universal relevance of his birth, the Pauline perspective emphasizes the birth of a new man and a new world in the birth of Jesus. Paul&#x27;s eschatological view of Jesus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam. Unlike Adam, the new man born in Jesus obeys God and ushers in a world of morality and salvation.

In the Pauline view, Adam is positioned as the first man and Jesus as the second: Adam, having corrupted himself by his disobedience, also infected humanity and left it with a curse as inheritance. The birth of Jesus, on the other hand, counterbalanced the fall of Adam, bringing forth redemption and repairing the damage done by Adam.

In patristic theology, Paul&#x27;s contrasting of Jesus as the new man versus Adam provided a framework for discussing the uniqueness of the birth of Jesus and the ensuing events of his life. The Nativity of Jesus thus began to serve as the starting point for &quot;cosmic Christology&quot; in which the birth, life and Resurrection of Jesus have universal implications. The concept of Jesus as the &quot;new man&quot; repeats in the cycle of birth and rebirth of Jesus from his Nativity to his resurrection: following his birth, through his morality and obedience to the Father, Jesus began a new harmony in the relationship between God the Father and man. The Nativity and resurrection of Jesus thus created the author and exemplar of a new humanity.

In the 2nd century Church Father Irenaeus writes:

Irenaeus was also one of the early theologians to use the analogy of &quot;second Adam and second Eve&quot;. He suggested the Virgin Mary as the &quot;second Eve&quot; and wrote that the Mary had &quot;untied the knot of sin bound up by the virgin Eve&quot; and that just as Eve had tempted Adam to disobey God, Mary had set a path of obedience for the second Adam (i.e. Jesus) from the Annunciation to Calvary so that Jesus could bring about salvation, undoing the damage of Adam.

In the 4th century, this uniqueness of the circumstances related to the Nativity of Jesus, and their interplay with the mystery of the incarnation, became a central element in both the theology and hymnody of Ephrem the Syrian. For him, the uniqueness of the Nativity of Jesus was supplemented with the sign of the majesty of the Creator through the ability of a powerful God to enter the world as a small newborn.

In the Middle Ages the birth of Jesus as the second Adam came to be seen in the context of Saint Augustine&#x27;s (&quot;happy fall&quot;) and was intertwined with the popular teachings on the fall from grace of Adam and Eve. Augustine was fond of a statement on the Nativity by Gregory of Nyssa and he quoted it five times: &quot;Venerate the Nativity, through which you are freed from the bonds of an earthly nativity&quot;. He also liked to quote: &quot;Just as in Adam all of us died, so too in Christ all of us will be brought to life&quot;.

The theology persisted into the Protestant Reformation, and second Adam was one of the six modes of atonement discussed by John Calvin. In the 20th century, leading theologian Karl Barth continued the same line of reasoning and viewed the Nativity of Jesus as the birth of a new man who succeeded Adam. In Barth&#x27;s theology, in contrast to Adam, Jesus acted as an obedient Son in the fulfilment of the divine will and was therefore free from sin and could hence reveal the righteousness of God the Father and bring about salvation.

===Christology===
The Nativity of Jesus impacted the Christological issues about the Person of Christ from the earliest days of Christianity. Luke&#x27;s Christology centers on the dialectics of the dual natures of the earthly and heavenly manifestations of existence of the Christ, while Matthew&#x27;s Christology focuses on the mission of Jesus and his role as the savior.

The belief in the divinity of Jesus leads to the question: &quot;was Jesus a man to be born of a woman or was he God born of a woman?&quot; A wide range of hypotheses and beliefs regarding the nature of the Nativity of Jesus were presented in the first four centuries of Christianity. Some of the debates involved the title (God bearer) for the Virgin Mary and began to illustrate the impact of Mariology on Christology. Some of these viewpoints were eventually declared as heresies, others led to schisms and the formation of new branches of the Church.

The salvific emphasis of later impacted the theological issues and the devotions to the Holy Name of Jesus. provides the only key to the &quot;Emmanuel Christology&quot; in the New Testament. Beginning with 1:23, Matthew shows a clear interest in identifying Jesus as &quot;God with us&quot; and in later developing the Emmanuel characterization of Jesus at key points throughout the rest of his Gospel. The name &#x27;Emmanuel&#x27; does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on it in (&quot;I am with you always, even unto the end of the world&quot;) to indicate that Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age. According to Ulrich Luz, the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages.

A number of ecumenical councils were convened in the 4th and 5th centuries to deal with these issues. The Council of Ephesus debated hypostasis (co-existing natures) versus Monophysitism (only one nature) versus Miaphysitism (two natures united as one) versus Nestorianism (disunion of two natures). The 451 Council of Chalcedon was highly influential and marked a key turning point in the Christological debates that divided the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 5th century. In Chalcedon the hypostatic union was decreed, namely that Jesus is both fully divine and fully human, making this part of the creed of orthodox Christianity.

In the 5th century, leading Church Father Pope Leo I used the Nativity as a key element of his theology. Leo gave 10 sermons on the Nativity and 7 have survived. The one on December 25, 451, demonstrates his concern to increase the importance of the feast of Nativity and along with it emphasize the two natures of Christ in defense of the Christological doctrine of hypostatic union. Leo often used his Nativity sermons as an occasion to attack opposing viewpoints, without naming the opposition. Thus Leo used the occasion of the Nativity feast to establish boundaries for what could be considered a heresy regarding the birth and nature of Christ.

In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas addressed the Christologocal attribution of the Nativity: if it should be attributed to the person (the Word) or only to the assumed human nature of that person. Aquinas treated Nativity in 8 separate articles in , each posing a separate question:

* &quot;Does Nativity regard the nature rather than the Person?&quot;
* &quot;Should a temporal Nativity be attributed to Christ?&quot;
* &quot;Should the Blessed Virgin be called Christ&#x27;s Mother?&quot;
* &quot;Should the Blessed Virgin be called the Mother of God?&quot;
* &quot;Are there two filiations in Christ?&quot;, etc.

To deal with this issue, Aquinas distinguishes between the person born and the nature in which the birth takes place. Aquinas thus resolved the question by arguing that in the hypostatic union Christ has two natures, one received from the Father from eternity, the other from his mother in time. This approach also resolved the Mariological problem of Mary receiving the title of Theotokos for under this scenario she is the &quot;Mother of God&quot;.

During the Reformation, John Calvin argued that Jesus was not sanctified to be &quot;God manifested as Incarnate&quot; () only due to his virgin birth, but through the action of the Holy Spirit at the instant of his birth. Thus Calvin argued that Jesus was exempt from original sin because he was sanctified at the moment of birth so that his generation was without blemish; as generation was blemishless before the fall of Adam.

==Impact on Christianity==
===Christmas, the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lord===

Christian Churches celebrate the Nativity of Jesus on Christmas, which is marked on December 25 by the Western Christian Churches, while many Eastern Christian Churches celebrate the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lord on January 7 (in 20th and 21st century). This is not a disagreement over the date of Christmas as such, but rather a preference of which calendar (Gregorian or Julian) should be used to determine the day that is December 25. In the Council of Tours of 567, the Church, with its desire to be universal, &quot;declared the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany to be one unified festal cycle&quot;; at this time, the disagreement was caused by using lunar calendars in Eastern provinces of the Empire. The liturgical season of Advent precedes, and is used to prepare for the celebration of Christmas. Customs of the Christmas season include completing an Advent daily devotional and Advent wreath, carol singing, gift giving, seeing Nativity plays, attending church services, and eating special food, such as Christmas cake. In many countries, such as Sweden, people start to set up their Advent and Christmas decorations on the first day of Advent. Liturgically, this is done in some parishes through a hanging of the greens ceremony.

===History of feasts and liturgical elements===
In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the Resurrection of Jesus became a separate feast as Easter and in the same century Epiphany began to be celebrated in the Churches of the East on January 6. The celebration of the feast of the Magi on January 6 may relate to a pre-Christian celebration for the blessing of the Nile in Egypt on January 5, but this is not historically certain. The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the Western Church notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.

The earliest source stating December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was Hippolytus of Rome (170–236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox which he placed on March 25, and then added nine months. There is historical evidence that by the middle of the 4th century the Christian churches of the East celebrated the birth and Baptism of Jesus on the same day, on January 6, while those in the West celebrated a Nativity feast on December 25 (perhaps influenced by the Winter solstice); and that by the last quarter of the 4th century, the calendars of both churches included both feasts. The earliest suggestions of a feast of the Baptism of Jesus on January 6 during the 2nd century comes from Clement of Alexandria, but there is no further mention of such a feast until 361 when Emperor Julian attended a feast on January 6 in the year 361.

The Chronography of 354 illuminated manuscript compiled in Rome includes an early reference to the celebration of a Nativity feast. In a sermon delivered in Antioch on December 25, , John Chrysostom provides specific information about the feast there, stating that the feast had existed for about 10 years. By around 385 the feast for the birth of Jesus was distinct from that of the Baptism and was held on December 25 in Constantinople, Nyssa and Amaseia. In a sermon in 386, Gregory of Nyssa specifically related the feast of Nativity with that of the martyrdom of Saint Stephen, celebrated a day later. By 390 the feast was also held in Iconium on that day.

Pope Leo I established a feast of the &quot;Mystery of Incarnation&quot; in the 5th century, in effect as the first formal feast for the Nativity of Jesus. Pope Sixtus III then instituted the practice of Midnight Mass just before that feast. The feast was celebrated in Jerusalem by the 6th century, when Emperor Justinian declared Christmas to be a legal holiday.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the theological importance of the Nativity of Jesus was coupled with an emphasis on the loving nature of the child Jesus in sermons by figures such as Jean Gerson. In his sermons Gerson emphasized the loving nature of Jesus at his Nativity, as well as his cosmic plan for the salvation of mankind.

By the early part of the 20th century, Christmas had become a &quot;cultural signature&quot; of Christianity and indeed of the Western culture even in countries such as the United States which are officially non-religious. By the beginning of the 21st century these countries began to pay more attention to the sensitivities of non-Christians during the festivities at the end of the calendar year.

===Transforming the image of Jesus===

Early Christians viewed Jesus as &quot;the Lord&quot; and the word appears over 700 times in the New Testament, referring to him as such. The use of the word in the Septuagint Bible also assigned to Jesus the Old Testament attributes of an omnipotent God. The use of the term , and hence the Lordship of Jesus, pre-dated the Pauline epistles, but Paul expanded and elaborated on the topic.

Pauline writings established among early Christians the image, and attributes of Jesus as not only referring to his eschatological victory, but to him as the &quot;divine image&quot; (Greek ) in whose face the glory of God shines forth. This image persisted among Christians as the predominant perception of Jesus for a number of centuries. More than any other title, defined the relationship between Jesus and those who believed in him as Christ: Jesus was their Lord and Master who was to be served with all their hearts and who would one day judge their actions throughout their lives.

The lordship attributes associated with the image of Jesus also implied his power over all creation. Paul then looked back and reasoned that the final lordship of Jesus was prepared from the very beginning, starting with pre-existence and the Nativity, based on his obedience as the image of God. Over time, based on the influence of Anselm of Canterbury, Bernard of Clairvaux and others, the image of Jesus began to be supplemented with a more &quot;tender image of Jesus&quot;, and the Franciscan approach to popular piety was instrumental in establishing this image.

The 13th century witnessed a major turning point in the development of a new &quot;tender image of Jesus&quot; within Christianity, as the Franciscans began to emphasize the humility of Jesus both at his birth and his death. The construction of the Nativity scene by Francis of Assisi was instrumental in portraying a softer image of Jesus that contrasted with the powerful and radiant image at the Transfiguration, and emphasized how God had taken a humble path to his own birth. As the Black Death raged in medieval Europe, the two mendicant orders of Franciscans and Dominicans helped the faithful cope with tragedies. One element of the Franciscan approach was the emphasis on the humility of Jesus and the poverty of his birth: the image of God was the image of Jesus, not a severe and punishing God, but himself humble at birth and sacrificed at death. The concept that the omnipotent Creator would set aside all power in order to conquer the hearts of men by love and that he would have been helplessly placed in a manger was as marvelous and as touching to the believers as the sacrifice of dying on the cross in Calvary.

Thus by the 13th century the tender joys of the Nativity of Jesus were added to the agony of his Crucifixion and a whole new range of approved religious emotions was ushered in, with wide-ranging cultural impacts for centuries thereafter. The Franciscans approached both ends of this spectrum of emotions. On one hand the introduction of the Nativity scene encouraged the tender image of Jesus, while on the other hand Francis of Assisi himself had a deep attachment to the sufferings of Jesus on the Cross and was said to have received the stigmata as an expression of that love. The dual nature of Franciscan piety based both on joy of Nativity and the sacrifice at Calvary had a deep appeal among city dwellers and as the Franciscan Friars travelled these emotions spread across the world, transforming the image of Jesus to a more tender, loving, and compassionate image. These traditions did not remain limited to Europe and soon spread to the other parts of the world such as Latin America, the Philippines and the United States.

According to Archbishop Rowan Williams, this transformation, accompanied by the proliferation of the tender image of Jesus in Madonna and Child paintings, made an important impact within the Christian ministry by allowing Christians to feel the living presence of Jesus as a loving figure &quot;who is always there to harbor and nurture those who turn to him for help&quot;.

==Hymns, art and music==

===Canticles appearing in Luke===
Luke&#x27;s Nativity text has given rise to four well-known canticles: the and the in the first chapter, and the and the in the second chapter. These &quot;Gospel canticles&quot; are now an integral part of the liturgical tradition. The parallel structure in Luke regarding the births of John the Baptist and Jesus, extends to the three canticles (Song of Zechariah), the and the .

The , in Luke 1:46–55, is spoken by Mary and is one of the eight most ancient Christian hymns, perhaps the earliest Marian hymn. The , in Luke 1:68–79, is spoken by Zechariah, while the , in Luke 2:29–32, is spoken by Simeon. The traditional is longer than the opening line presented in Luke 2:14, and is often called the &quot;Song of the Angels&quot; given that it was uttered by the angels in the Annunciation to the Shepherds.

The three canticles , and the , if not originating in the Gospel of Luke, may have their roots in the earliest Christian liturgical services in Jerusalem, but their exact origins remain unknown.

===Visual arts===


One of the most visible traditions during the Christmas season is the display of manger scenes depicting the Nativity, usually in the form of statues or figurines, in private homes, businesses and churches, either inside or outside the building. This tradition is usually attributed to Francis of Assisi who was described as creating such a display at Greccio, Italy, in 1223 as related by St. Bonaventure in his &quot;Life of Saint Francis of Assisi&quot; written around 1260.

Before the tradition of building and displaying manger scenes developed, there were paintings depicting the subject. The earliest artistic depictions of the Nativity were in the catacombs and on sarcophagi in Rome. As gentile visitors, the Magi were popular in these scenes, representing the significance of the arrival of the Messiah to all peoples. The ox and ass were also taken to symbolize the Jews and the gentiles, and have remained a constant since the earliest depictions. Mary was soon seated on a throne as the Magi visited.

Depictions of the Nativity soon became a normal component of cycles in art illustrating both the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin. Nativity images also carry the message of redemption: God&#x27;s unification with matter forms the mystery of the Incarnation, a turning point in the Christian perspective on Salvation.

In the Eastern Church painted icons of the Nativity often correspond to specific hymns to Mary, e.g. to the : &quot;The Virgin today bringeth forth the Transubstantial, and the eart offereth a cave to the Unapproachable.&quot; In many Eastern icons of Nativity (often accompanied by matching hymnody) two basic elements are emphasized. First the event portrays the mystery of incarnation as a foundation for the Christian faith, and the combined nature of Christ as divine and human. Secondly, it relates the event to the natural life of the world, and its consequences for humanity.

===Hymns, music and performances===


Like 1st-century Jews, early Christians rejected the use of musical instruments in religious ceremonies and instead relied on chants and plainsong leading to the use of the term &quot;a cappella&quot; (in the chapel) for these chants.

One of the earliest Nativity hymns was composed by Ambrose of Milan in the 4th century. By the beginning of the 5th century, the Spanish poet Prudentius had written &quot;From the Heart of the Father&quot; where the ninth stanza focused on the Nativity and portrayed Jesus as the creator of the universe. In the 5th century the Gallic poet Sedulius composed &quot;From the lands that see the Sun arise&quot; in which the humility of the birth of Jesus was portrayed. The , one of the eight most ancient Christian hymns and perhaps the earliest Marian hymn, is based on the Annunciation.

Romanus the Melodist had a dream of the Virgin Mary the night before the feast of the Nativity, and when he woke up the next morning, composed his first hymn &quot;On the Nativity&quot; and continued composing hymns (perhaps several hundred) to the end of his life. Re-enactments of Nativity, which are now called Nativity plays, were part of the &quot;troparion&quot; hymns in the liturgy of Byzantine Rite churches, from Sophronius of Jerusalem in the 7th century. By the 13th century, the Franciscans had encouraged a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native languages. Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of John Awdlay, a Shropshire chaplain, who lists twenty-five &quot;caroles of Cristemas&quot;.

The largest body of musical works about Christ in which he does not speak are about the Nativity. A large body of liturgical music, as well as a great deal of para-liturgical texts, carols and folk music exist about the Nativity of Jesus. Christmas carols have
come to be viewed as a cultural-signature of the Nativity of Jesus.

Most musical Nativity narrations are not biblical and did not come about until church music assimilated opera in the 17th century. However, thereafter there was a torrent of new music, such as Heinrich Schütz&#x27;s 1660, Marc-Antoine Charpentier &quot;(Midnight Mass, Pastorals, Oratorio, instrumental music&quot;, 11 settings), &quot;The Christmas Story&quot; and Bach&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Oratorio&quot; in the 18th century, as well as &quot;Lisz&#x27;s Christus&quot;, Berlioz&#x27;s (1850), Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27; Christmas Oratorio (1858), etc. John Milton&#x27;s classic 1629 poem &quot;Ode on the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot; was used by John McEwan in 1901.

==Historical analysis==
===Traditional views===
According to some scholars, the two Gospel accounts of the Nativity are historically accurate and do not contradict each other, with similarities such as the birthplace of Bethlehem and the virgin birth. George Kilpatrick and Michael Patella state that a comparison of the Nativity accounts of Luke and Matthew show common elements in terms of the virgin birth, the birth at Bethlehem, and the upbringing at Nazareth, and that although there are differences in the accounts of the Nativity in Luke and Matthew, a general narrative may be constructed by combining the two. A number of biblical scholars have attempted to show how the text from both narratives can be interwoven as a gospel harmony to create one account that begins with a trip from Nazareth to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born, followed by the flight to Egypt, and ending with a return to Nazareth.

Neither Luke nor Matthew claims their birth narratives are based on direct testimony. Raymond E. Brown suggested in 1973 that Joseph was the source of Matthew&#x27;s account and Mary of Luke&#x27;s, but modern scholars consider this &quot;highly unlikely&quot;, given that the story emerged so late.

Roman Catholic scholars, such as John L. McKenzie, Raymond E. Brown, and Daniel J. Harrington express the view that due to the scarcity of ancient records, a number of issues regarding the historicity of some Nativity episodes can never be fully determined, and that the more important task is deciding what the Nativity narratives meant to the early Christian communities.

===Critical analysis===
Many scholars do not see the Luke and Matthew Nativity stories as historically factual, regarding them as laced with theology and presenting two different accounts and genealogies. For instance, they point to Matthew&#x27;s account of the appearance of an angel to Joseph in a dream; the wise men from the East; the massacre of the innocents; and the flight to Egypt, which do not appear in Luke, which instead describes the appearance of an angel to Mary; the Roman census; the birth in a manger; and the choir of angels appearing to the shepherds in the fields. Sanders considers Luke&#x27;s census, for which everyone returned to their ancestral home, not historically credible, as this was contrary to Roman practice; they would not have uprooted everyone from their homes and farms in the Empire by forcing them to return to their ancestral cities. Moreover, people were not able to trace their own lineages back 42 generations. More generally, according to Karl Rahner the gospels show little interest in synchronizing the episodes of the birth or subsequent life of Jesus with the secular history of the age. As a result, modern scholars do not use much of the birth narratives for historical information. Nevertheless, they are considered to contain some useful biographical information: Jesus being born near the end of the reign of Herod, during the reign of Emperor Augustus and his father being named Joseph are considered historically plausible.

Most modern scholars accept the Marcan priority hypothesis, that the Luke and Matthew accounts are based on the Gospel of Mark, but that the birth narratives come from the evangelists&#x27; independent sources, known as the M source for Matthew and the L source for Luke, which were added later.

While Géza Vermes and E. P. Sanders dismiss the accounts as pious fiction, Raymond E. Brown sees them as having been constructed from historical traditions which predate the Gospels. According to Brown, there is no uniform agreement among scholars on the historicity of the accounts, e.g., most of those scholars who reject the historicity of the birth at Bethlehem argue for a birth at Nazareth, a few suggest Capernaum, and others have hypothesized locations as far away as Chorazin. Bruce Chilton and archaeologist Aviram Oshri have proposed a birth at Bethlehem of Galilee, a site located from Nazareth at which remains dating to the time of Herod the Great have been excavated. Armand P. Tarrech states that Chilton&#x27;s hypothesis has no support in either the Jewish or Christian sources, although Chilton seems to take seriously the statement in that Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem.

Many view the discussion of historicity as secondary, given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than chronological timelines. For instance, Matthew pays far more attention to the name of the child and its theological implications than the actual birth event itself.

<text>Victoria, Princess Royal (Victoria Adelaide Mary Louisa; 21 November 1840 – 5 August 1901) was German Empress and Queen of Prussia as the wife of Frederick III, German Emperor. She was the eldest child of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and was created Princess Royal in 1841. As the eldest child of the British monarch, she was briefly heir presumptive until the birth of her younger brother, the future Edward VII. She was the mother of Wilhelm II, the last German Emperor.

Educated by her father in a politically liberal environment, Victoria was married at the age of 17 to Prince Frederick of Prussia, with whom she went on to have eight children. Victoria shared with Frederick her liberal views and hopes that Prussia and the later German Empire should become a constitutional monarchy, based on the British model. Criticised for this attitude and for her English origins, Victoria suffered ostracism by the Hohenzollerns and the Berlin court. This isolation increased after the rise to power of Otto von Bismarck, one of her most staunch political opponents, in 1862.

Victoria was empress for only a few months, during which she had opportunity to influence the policy of the German Empire. Frederick III died in 1888 – 99 days after his accession – from laryngeal cancer and was succeeded by their son Wilhelm II, who had much more conservative views than his parents. After her husband&#x27;s death, she became widely known as Empress Frederick (German: &quot;Kaiserin Friedrich&quot;). The empress dowager then settled in Kronberg im Taunus, where she built Friedrichshof, a castle, named in honour of her late husband. Increasingly isolated after the weddings of her younger daughters, she died of breast cancer in August 1901, less than 7 months after the death of her mother, Queen Victoria, in January 1901.

The correspondence between Victoria and her parents has been preserved almost completely: 3,777 letters from Queen Victoria to her eldest daughter and about 4,000 letters from the empress to her mother are preserved and catalogued. These give a detailed insight into life at the Prussian court between 1858 and 1900.

==Early life and education==

Princess Victoria was born on 21 November 1840 at Buckingham Palace, London. She was the first child of Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert. When she was born, the doctor exclaimed sadly: &quot;Oh Madame, it&#x27;s a girl!&quot; The queen replied: &quot;Never mind, next time it will be a prince!&quot; As a daughter of the sovereign, Victoria was born a British princess. In addition, she was heir presumptive to the throne of the United Kingdom from her birth until the birth of her younger brother Prince Albert Edward (later King Edward VII) on 9 November 1841. On 19 January 1841, she was made Princess Royal, a title sometimes conferred on the eldest daughter of the sovereign. To her family, she was known simply as &quot;Vicky&quot;.

She was baptised in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace on 10 February 1841 (on her parents&#x27; first wedding anniversary) by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Howley. The Lily font was commissioned especially for the occasion of her christening. Her godparents were Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen (her great-aunt), Leopold I of Belgium (her great-uncle), Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (her paternal grandfather, for whom the Duke of Wellington stood proxy), Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex (her great-uncle), the Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester (her great-aunt) and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (her maternal grandmother).

The royal couple decided to give their children as complete an education as possible. Queen Victoria, who succeeded her uncle King William IV at the age of 18, believed that she herself had not been sufficiently prepared for government affairs. For his part Prince Albert, born in the small Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, had received a more careful education thanks to his uncle King Leopold I of Belgium.

Shortly after the birth of Victoria, Prince Albert wrote a memoir detailing the tasks and duties of all those involved with the royal children. Another 48-page document, written a year-and-a-half later by the Baron Stockmar, an intimate of the royal couple, details the educational principles to be used with the little princess. The royal couple, however, had only a very vague idea of the proper educational development of a child. Queen Victoria, for example, believed that the fact that her baby sucked on bracelets was a sign of deficient education. According to Hannah Pakula, biographer of the future German empress, the first two governesses of the princess were therefore particularly well chosen. Experienced in dealing with children, Lady Lyttelton directed the nursery through which passed all royal children after Victoria&#x27;s second year and diplomatically managed to soften the unrealistic demands of the royal couple. Sarah Anne Hildyard, the children&#x27;s second governess, was a competent teacher who quickly developed a close relationship with her pupils.

Precocious and intelligent, Victoria began to learn French at the age of 18 months, and to study German when aged four. She also learned Greek and Latin. From the age of six her curriculum included arithmetic, geography and history, and her father tutored her in politics and philosophy. She also studied science and literature. Her school days, interrupted by three hours of recreation, began at 8:20 and finished at 18:00. Unlike her brother, whose curriculum was even more severe, Victoria was an excellent pupil who was always hungry for knowledge. However, she showed an obstinate character.

Queen Victoria and her husband wanted to remove their children from court life as much as possible, so they acquired Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Near the main building, Albert built for his children a Swiss-inspired cottage with a small kitchen and a carpentry workshop. In this building the royal children learned manual work and practical life. Prince Albert was very involved in the education of their offspring. He closely followed the progress of his children and gave some of their lessons himself as well as spending time playing with them. Victoria is described as having &quot;idolised&quot; her father and having inherited his liberal political views.

===First meeting with Frederick===

In the German Confederation, Prince William of Prussia and his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, were among the personalities with whom Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were allies. The British sovereign also had regular epistolary contact with her cousin Augusta after 1846. The revolution that broke out in Berlin in 1848 further strengthened the links between the two royal couples by requiring the heir presumptive to the Prussian throne to find shelter for three months in the British court.

In 1851, William returned to London with his wife and two children (Frederick and Louise) on the occasion of the Great Exhibition. For the first time Victoria met her future husband, and despite the age difference (she was 11 years old and he was 19) they got along very well. To promote the contact between the two, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert asked their daughter to guide Frederick through the exhibition, and during the visit the princess was able to converse in perfect German whereas the prince was able to say only a few words in English. The meeting was therefore a success, and years later Prince Frederick recalled the positive impression that Victoria made on him during this visit, with her mixture of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity.

It was not only his encounter with little Victoria, however, that positively impressed Frederick during the four weeks of his English stay. The young Prussian prince shared his liberal ideas with the Prince Consort. Frederick was fascinated by the relationships among the members of the British royal family. In London, court life was not as rigid and conservative as in Berlin, and Queen Victoria and Prince Albert&#x27;s relationship with their children was very different from William and Augusta&#x27;s relationship with theirs.

After Frederick returned to Germany, he began a close correspondence with Victoria. Behind this nascent friendship was the desire of Queen Victoria and her husband to forge closer ties with Prussia. In a letter to her uncle King Leopold I of Belgium the British sovereign conveyed the desire that the meeting between her daughter and the Prussian prince would lead to a closer relationship between the two young people.

==Engagement and marriage==
===Engagement===
Frederick had received a comprehensive education and in particular was formed by personalities such as the writer Ernst Moritz Arndt and historian Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann. According to the tradition of the House of Hohenzollern, he also received rigorous military training.

In 1855 Prince Frederick made another trip to Great Britain and visited Victoria and her family in Scotland at Balmoral Castle. The purpose of his trip was to see the Princess Royal again, to ensure that she would be a suitable consort for him. In Berlin the response to this journey to Britain was far from positive. In fact many members of the Prussian court wanted to see the heir presumptive&#x27;s son marry a Russian grand duchess. King Frederick William IV, who had allowed his nephew to marry a British princess, even had to keep his approval a secret because his own wife showed strong Anglophobia.

At the time of Frederick&#x27;s second visit Victoria was 15 years old. A little shorter than her mother, the princess was tall and far from the ideal of beauty of the time. Queen Victoria was concerned that the Prussian prince would not find her daughter sufficiently attractive. Nevertheless, from the first dinner with the prince it was clear to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert that the mutual liking of the two young people that had begun in 1851 was still vivid. In fact after only three days with the royal family Frederick asked Victoria&#x27;s parents permission to marry their daughter. They were thrilled by the news but gave their approval on condition that the marriage should not take place before Victoria&#x27;s 17th birthday.

Once this condition was accepted the engagement of Victoria and Frederick was publicly announced on 17 May 1856. The immediate reaction in Great Britain was disapproval. The English public complained about the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s neutrality during the Crimean War of 1853–1856. &quot;The Times&quot; characterised the Hohenzollern as a &quot;miserable dynasty&quot; that pursued an inconsistent and unreliable foreign policy, with the maintenance of the throne depending solely on Russia. The newspaper also criticised the failure of King Frederick William IV to respect the political guarantees given to the population during the revolution of 1848. In the German Confederation the reactions to the announcement of the engagement were mixed: several members of the Hohenzollern family and conservatives opposed it and liberal circles welcomed the proposed union with the British crown.

===Preparation for the role of Prussian princess===
The Prince Consort, who was part of the &quot;Vormärz&quot;, had long supported the ‘Coburg plan’, i.e. the idea that a liberal Prussia could serve as an example for other German states and would be able to achieve the Unification of Germany. During the involuntary stay of Prince William of Prussia in London in 1848 the Prince Consort tried to convince his Hohenzollern cousin of the need to transform Prussia into a constitutional monarchy following the British model. However, the future German emperor was not persuaded: he instead kept very conservative views.

Eager to make his daughter the instrument of the liberalisation of Germany, Prince Albert took advantage of the two years of Victoria and Frederick&#x27;s engagement to give the Princess Royal the most comprehensive training possible. Thus he taught himself history and modern European politics and actually wrote to the princess many essays on events that occurred in Prussia. However, the Prince Consort overestimated the ability of the liberal reform movement in Germany at a time when only a small middle class and some intellectual circles shared his views on the German Confederation. Hence Prince Albert gave his daughter a particularly difficult role, especially in the face of a critical and conservative Hohenzollern court.

===Domestic issues and marriage===

To pay the dowry of the Princess Royal, the British Parliament allotted the sum of 40,000 pounds and also gave her an allowance of 8,000 pounds per year. Meanwhile, in Berlin, King Frederick William IV provided an annual allowance of 9,000 thalers to his nephew Frederick. The income of the second-in-line to the Prussian throne proved insufficient to cover a budget consistent with his position and that of his future wife. Throughout much of their marriage, Victoria relied on her own resources.
The Berlin court of the royal couple was chosen by Frederick&#x27;s aunt, Queen Elisabeth, and his mother, Princess Augusta. They summoned people who had been in court service for a long time and were much older than Victoria and Frederick. Prince Albert therefore asked the Hohenzollerns that his daughter could keep at least two ladies-in-waiting who were her age and of British origin. His request was not completely denied but, as a compromise, Victoria received two young ladies-in-waiting of German origin: Countesses Walburga von Hohenthal and Countess Marie zu Lynar. However, Prince Albert did succeed in imposing Ernst Alfred Christian von Stockmar, the son of his friend Baron von Stockmar, as his daughter&#x27;s private secretary.

Convinced that the marriage of a British princess to the second-in-line to the Prussian throne would be regarded as an honour by the Hohenzollerns, Prince Albert insisted that his daughter retain her title of Princess Royal after the wedding. However, owing to the very anti-British and pro-Russian views of the Berlin court, the prince&#x27;s decision only aggravated the situation.

The question of where to hold the marriage ceremony raised the most criticism. To the Hohenzollerns, it seemed natural that the nuptials of the future Prussian king would be held in Berlin. However, Queen Victoria insisted that her eldest daughter must marry in her own country, and in the end, she prevailed. The wedding of Victoria and Frederick took place at the Chapel Royal of St. James&#x27;s Palace in London on 25 January 1858.

==Princess of Prussia==
===Maternal criticism===

Victoria&#x27;s move to Berlin began a large correspondence between the princess and her parents. Each week, she sent a letter to her father that usually contained comments on German political events. The majority of these letters have been preserved and have become a valuable source for knowing the Prussian court.

But these letters also show the will of Queen Victoria to dictate her daughter&#x27;s every move. She demanded that Victoria appear equally loyal to her homeland and her new country. But this quickly became impossible, and the most insignificant events confronted the princess with insoluble problems. For example, the death of the Duchess of Orléans, a distant relative of the British and Prussian royal houses, brought a month of mourning in London, while in Berlin the mourning period lasted only one week. Victoria was bound to respect the period of mourning in use among the Hohenzollerns, but this earned her the criticism of her mother, who believed that, as a Princess Royal and daughter of the queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Victoria should follow the custom in use in England.

Concerned about the effect of the continual maternal criticism on Victoria&#x27;s psychological health, Baron von Stockmar asked Prince Albert to intervene and ask the queen to moderate her demands. However, the baron was unable to reduce the attacks that the princess suffered from the Russophilic and Anglophobic circles of the Berlin court. For most of the 19th century, Russia and Britain were not just geopolitical rivals in Asia, but also ideological opponents as many in both nations believed autocratic Russia and democratic Britain were destined to battle each for world domination. In Prussia, the &quot;Junkers&quot; tended to see much in common with the ordered society of Imperial Russia, and disliked British democracy. She was often hurt by unkind comments from the Hohenzollern family.

A keen amateur gardener, Victoria&#x27;s attempts to import English-style gardens into Prussia prompted what became known as the &quot;Anglo-Prussian garden war&quot; as the court fought from 1858 onward against Victoria&#x27;s attempts to change the gardens at the Sanssouci palace into something more English. The simple, unadorned English-style geometric garden designs favored by Victoria were out of favor with the Prussian court which favored the Italianate style, and which ferociously resisted Victoria&#x27;s attempts to create English-style gardens.

===Official duties===
At 17 years old, Victoria had to perform many tedious official duties. Almost every evening, she had to appear at formal dinners, theatrical performances or public receptions. If foreign relatives of the Hohenzollerns were located in Berlin or Potsdam, her protocolary duties widened. Sometimes she was forced to greet guests of the royal family at the station at 7:00 in the morning and be present at receptions past midnight.

Upon the arrival of Victoria in Berlin, King Frederick William IV gave to Frederick and his wife an old wing of the Berlin Palace. The building was in very bad condition, and it did not even contain a bathtub. The couple moved to the Kronprinzenpalais in November 1858. In summer, they resided at the Neues Palais.

===First childbirth===

A little over a year after her marriage, on 27 January 1859, Victoria gave birth to her first child, the future German Emperor Wilhelm II. The delivery was extremely complicated. The maid responsible for alerting doctors to the onset of contractions delayed giving notice. Moreover, the gynecologists hesitated to examine the princess, who was wearing only a flannel nightgown. The baby was in breech, and the delayed delivery could have caused the death of both the princess and her son.

Finally, doctors managed to save both mother and child. The baby, however, suffered damage at the brachial plexus, and the nerves in his arm were injured. As he grew, it failed to develop normally, and by the time Wilhelm was an adult, his left arm was fifteen centimetres shorter than his right. There is also speculation that the difficult labour caused fetal distress, which deprived the future emperor of oxygen for eight to ten minutes and might have brought about other neurological problems.

The doctors tried to calm both Victoria and Frederick, affirming that their baby could recover fully from his injuries. Still, the couple chose not to inform the British court of Wilhelm&#x27;s condition. However, over the weeks it became clear that the child&#x27;s arm would not recover, and, after four months of doubts, Victoria decided to give the sad news to her parents. Fortunately for the princess, the birth of her second child, Princess Charlotte, on 24 July 1860, took place without difficulty.

==Crown Princess of Prussia==
===Early issues and struggles===
With the death of King Frederick William IV on 2 January 1861, his brother, who had acted as regent since 1858, ascended the throne as King William I. Frederick was then the new crown prince of Prussia but his situation at court did not change much: his father refused to increase his allowance, and Crown Princess Victoria continued to contribute significantly to the family budget with her dowry and allowance. In a letter to the Baron von Stockmar, Prince Albert commented on the situation:

In addition to their financial limitations, Frederick and Victoria faced more problems. As heir apparent, he could not travel outside Prussia without the king&#x27;s permission. There was a rumour that this measure was intended to limit Victoria&#x27;s travels to the United Kingdom. Upon his accession to the throne, King William I received a letter from Prince Albert in which he implicitly asked that the Prussian constitution serve as an example for other German states. However, this letter increased the king&#x27;s resentment of Albert and of Frederick and Victoria, who had the same liberal ideas.

===Father&#x27;s death and political crisis===

On 14 December 1861, Prince Albert died of typhoid fever. Because of her very close relationship with her father, Victoria was devastated by the news. She went with her husband to England to attend the funeral.

Shortly after this tragedy Frederick and Victoria, still in mourning, had to face the first major crisis of William I&#x27;s reign, and they were not prepared to deal with it. The Prussian Parliament denied the king the money needed for his plan of reorganisation of the army. William I considered the reform to be of paramount importance and decided to dissolve the parliament on 11 March 1862, reviving the Prussian constitutional conflict. In a fierce confrontation between the crown and the Landtag, the king considered setting a deadline for leaving the throne.

Victoria tried to convince her husband to accept his father&#x27;s abdication. However, the prince did not agree with his wife and supported his father, saying that he would stand firm before the Landtag. For Frederick, the abdication of a monarch after a conflict with the parliament would create a dangerous precedent and weaken his successors. The crown prince also judged that his support of his father&#x27;s abdication in his favour would be a serious dereliction of his duties as a son.

Finally, William I chose not to abdicate and appointed Otto von Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia on 22 September. Leader of the Conservative Party, the politician was willing to rule without a parliamentary majority and even without an authorised budget. The king was pleased with the situation, but his wife, the liberal Queen Augusta, and especially his son and daughter-in-law, harshly criticised the decision. However, Bismarck remained at the head of the Prussian government and subsequently of the German government until 1890 and was instrumental in the isolation of the crown prince and his wife.

===Increasing isolation===
With the outbreak of the Prussian constitutional conflict, the opposition between liberals and conservatives in Berlin reached its peak. Suspected of supporting parliamentarians against William I, the Crown Prince and his wife were subjected to harsh criticism. The trip that the couple made to the Mediterranean in October 1862 aboard Queen Victoria&#x27;s yacht served as a pretext for conservatives to accuse Frederick of abandoning his father in a time of great political tension. They also emphasised the fact that the crown prince travelled aboard a foreign vessel escorted by an English warship.

Following the announcement of the engagement between Victoria&#x27;s brother the Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, daughter of the future King Christian IX and representative of a rival Prussian state, Victoria&#x27;s position in the Berlin court was further weakened. The German public was of the opinion that the Crown Princess was responsible for encouraging the union between Denmark and the United Kingdom.

Frederick caused an incident when he openly criticised the policy of his father and Bismarck. During the official visit to Danzig, the crown prince publicly rejected an order issued by Bismarck on 1 June 1863 that allowed the Prussian authorities to prohibit the publication of a newspaper whose content was considered inappropriate. Enraged by the speech of his son, William I accused him of disobedience and threatened to suspend him from his military duties and even to exclude him from the succession to the throne. In conservative circles, which demanded exemplary punishment, few joined the voices of Prince Charles, the king&#x27;s younger brother, and General Edwin von Manteuffel, who believed that Frederick should be tried in a court-martial.

Naturally, Victoria was not immune to these criticisms from conservatives. In fact, many suspected that she was behind the words of the heir&#x27;s speech in Danzig.

Severely criticised in Germany, the couple saw their behaviour praised in Great Britain. &quot;The Times&quot; noted: 

The support of the British newspaper became a new source of problems for Frederick and Victoria. The article contained everyday details suggesting that Victoria revealed certain confidential information to the press. The authorities opened an investigation against her, and because of this pressure, Victoria&#x27;s personal secretary, Baron Ernst von Stockmar, resigned his position.

===Prussian-Danish War===
In the international arena, Bismarck tried to build German unity around Prussia. His plans were to end the Austrian influence in the German Confederation and impose Prussian hegemony in Germany. Faithful to his objectives, Bismarck involved Prussia in the Second Schleswig War against Denmark in 1864. However, the prime minister counteracted with the help of Austria in the conflict.

Despite the familial relations of the Prince of Wales with Copenhagen, the British government refused to intervene in the war between the German Confederation and Denmark. That had a certain importance in the royal family, which was deeply divided by the conflict. In addition, many in Berlin suspected that the crown princess was unhappy over the Prussian military successes against the country of her sister-in-law Alexandra.

Despite criticism and distrust, Victoria supported German troops. Following the example of Florence Nightingale, who had helped to improve the medical care of British soldiers in the Crimean War, the crown princess became involved in the aid of wounded soldiers. During the birthday celebrations of William I, Victoria, along with her husband, created a social fund for the families of soldiers killed or seriously injured.

During the war, Frederick joined the Prussian Army and was part of the fighting under the command of Field Marshal Friedrich von Wrangel. He distinguished himself with his courageous valour in the Battle of Dybbøl (7–18 April 1864) that marked the defeat of Denmark by the Austro-Prussian coalition. Pleased with the German victory, Victoria expected the military success of her husband would encourage people to understand that she was the wife of the heir apparent. In a letter to Frederick, she complained of the constant criticism and being considered too British in Prussia and too Prussian in Great Britain.

With the final victory over Denmark and the Treaty of Vienna (signed on 30 October 1864), it was decided that the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg would be administered by a joint Prussian-Austrian government. However, this new division became a source of conflict between Vienna and Berlin.

===Austro-Prussian War===

After the War of the Duchies, Germany experienced a short period of peace. The Gastein Convention, signed by the two winners on 14 August 1865, placed the former Danish provinces under Prussian-Austrian control and both countries occupied a part of the duchies. However, differences of opinion concerning the administration of the provinces quickly triggered a conflict between the former allies. On 9 June 1866, Prussia occupied Holstein, which was administered by Austria. In the meanwhile, Vienna asked the Diet of the German Confederation for a general mobilisation of the German states against Prussia, which took place on 14 June.

Considering the mobilisation illegal, Prussia proclaimed the dissolution of the German Confederation and invaded Saxony, Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, effectively starting the Austro-Prussian War. During the Battle of Königgrätz (3 July 1866) in which Crown Prince Frederick was instrumental, Austria suffered a heavy defeat and capitulated shortly afterward. Finally, with the Peace of Prague (23 August 1866), Vienna withdrew from the German Confederation, which was dissolved. Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, the Duchy of Nassau and the Free City of Frankfurt were annexed by Prussia.

Shortly after the Prussian victory at Königgrätz, Bismarck asked the parliament for more money for the army, which raised a new controversy between the liberal parliamentarians. Frederick welcomed the creation of the North German Confederation, which joined Prussia and some Germanic principalities, because he saw that it was the first step toward German unification. However, the confederation was far from adopting the liberal ideas of the crown prince. Despite being democratically elected, the Reichstag did not have the same powers as the British parliament. In addition, local sovereigns were more interested in maintaining their prerogatives, and the new North German Constitution gave many powers to Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Less enthusiastic than her husband, Victoria saw the North German Confederation as an extension of the Prussian political system, which she hated. Nevertheless, she remained hopeful that the situation was temporary and that a united and liberal Germany could be created.

===Family life===
During the Austro-Prussian War, Victoria and Frederick received a hard blow. Sigismund, their fourth child, died of meningitis at 21 months on 18 June 1866, just a few days before the Battle of Königgrätz. The tragedy devastated the Crown Princess, who received no comfort from her mother or her in-laws. Queen Victoria, still mourning the loss of Prince Albert, did not understand her daughter&#x27;s feelings and believed that the loss of a child was much less severe than that of a husband. Queen Augusta demanded that her daughter-in-law quickly resume her official duties.

With peace restored in Germany, the crown prince frequently travelled abroad to represent the Berlin court. Victoria rarely accompanied her husband on the trips, mainly because they tried to keep their expenses to a minimum. In addition, the crown princess did not want to leave her children for long periods of time. After Sigismund&#x27;s death, the royal family grew with the arrival of four new children between 1866 and 1872. While the elder children (Wilhelm, Charlotte and Henry) were left in the care of governesses, the younger ones (Sigismund, Victoria, Waldemar, Sophie and Margaret) were raised personally by Victoria, which was a point of conflict with both her mother and mother-in-law.

In Berlin, Victoria&#x27;s situation remained difficult, and her relationship with Queen Augusta, who also had liberal ideas, continued to be tense. Any gesture from her was a pretext for the worst criticism from her mother-in-law; for example, Augusta disapproved when Victoria chose to use a landau instead of a traditional barouche with two horses. The opposition between the two women grew so much that Queen Victoria had to intercede for her daughter with William I.

===Franco-Prussian War===

On 19 July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began, and it would lead to the fall of the Second French Empire. As in previous conflicts against Denmark and Austria, Frederick participated actively in the fight against the French. At the head of the 3rd German army, he had a decisive role in the battles of Wissembourg (4 August 1870) and Wörth (6 August 1870), and also had a notorious role in the Battle of Sedan (1 September 1870) during the Siege of Paris. Jealous of the military success of the heir to the throne, Bismarck tried to undermine his prestige. The chancellor used the late arrival of the Third German Army to Paris to accuse the crown prince of trying to protect France under pressure from his mother and his wife. During an official dinner, Bismarck accused the queen and Victoria of being ardently francophile, an incident that was soon known by the newspapers.

Victoria&#x27;s commitment to the wounded soldiers had no impact in the German press. In Hamburg, she had built a military hospital, running it regardless of costs, in addition to visiting the war-wounded soldiers in Wiesbaden, Biberach, Bingen, Bingerbrück, Rüdesheim and Mainz. However, Victoria was accused of performing tasks normally attributed to the queen, prompting the wrath of her in-laws. Finally, William I ordered her to stop that &quot;theater of charity&quot; and return to Berlin to represent the royal family.

==German Crown Princess==
===Proclamation of the German Empire===

On 18 January 1871 (the anniversary of the accession of the Hohenzollern dynasty to the royalty in 1701), the princes of the North German Confederation and those of South Germany (Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and Hesse-Darmstadt) proclaimed William I as hereditary German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Then they symbolically united their states within a new German Empire. Frederick and Victoria became German crown prince and crown princess, and Otto von Bismarck was appointed imperial chancellor.

Subsequently, the Catholic states of South Germany that were previously bound to Prussia by a &quot;Zollverein&quot; (Customs Union), were officially incorporated into Unified Germany by the treaties of Versailles (26 February 1871) and Frankfurt (10 May 1871).

===Enlightened princess===

Despite being named field marshal because of his military performance in the wars of the 1860s, Frederick did not receive the command of any troops after the Franco-Prussian War. In fact, the emperor did not trust his own son and tried to keep him away from state affairs because of his &quot;too English&quot; ideas. The crown prince was appointed &quot;Curator of the Royal Museums&quot;, a task that raised some enthusiasm in his wife. Following the advice of her father, Victoria had continued her intellectual formation after arriving in Germany: she read Goethe, Lessing, Heine and Stuart Mill and frequented intellectual circles with her husband. The writer Gustav Freytag was a close friend of the couple and Gustav zu Putlitz was appointed Frederick&#x27;s Chamberlain for some time. Despite the indignation of her mother, Victoria was also interested in the Theory of Evolution of Darwin and the ideas of British geologist Lyell. The German astronomer Wilhelm Julius Foerster reported that she visited the Berlin Observatory frequently and took keen interest in his astronomical work, and in the growth of the German Society for Ethical Culture. Eager to understand the principles of socialism, she read the work of Karl Marx and encouraged her husband to frequent the salon of Countess Marie von Schleinitz, a place known for being a meeting point of Bismarck&#x27;s opponents.

Unlike many of their contemporaries, Victoria and Frederick rejected antisemitism. In a letter to her mother, Victoria harshly criticised the essay &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; (Judaism in Music) by Richard Wagner, whom she considered ridiculous and unfair. As for Frederick, he did not hesitate to make public appearances in synagogues when manifestations began of hatred against the Jews in Germany, especially in the early 1880s. In 1880–1881, there was a campaign waged by the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement to disemancipate German Jews, led by the Lutheran Pastor Adolf Stoecker and the historian Heinrich von Treitschke, leading to a quarter of a million Germans signing a petition asking the government to ban all Jewish immigration, forbid Jews from holding public office, to work as teachers, and from attending universities, which was a mere prelude to the ultimate goal of the &quot;völkisch&quot; activists: stripping Jews of their German citizenship. Both Stoecker and Treitschke were very popular and well respected men in Germany, and their anti-Semitic campaign attracted much support from the Prussian Army officer corps, university students, and the court, but Victoria was fearless in attacking the anti-Semitic leaders and wrote, &quot;Treitschke and his supporters are lunatics of the most dangerous sort&quot;. In another letter, Victoria suggested that Stoecker and his followers belonged in a lunatic asylum since so much of what he had to say reflected an unbalanced mind. In yet another letter, she wrote that she had become ashamed of her adopted country as Stoecker and Treitschke &quot;behave &quot;so hatefully&quot; towards people of a different faith and another race who have become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!&quot;.

Victoria and her husband, the latter wearing the uniform of a Prussian field marshal, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for the German Jews threatened by what Victoria called Treitschke&#x27;s &quot;disgraceful&quot; attacks. In 1881, they attended a synagogue service in Wiesbaden &quot;to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are&quot; just as the &quot;Reichstag&quot; was beginning to debate the issue of Jewish disemancipation. Her mother, Queen Victoria, was proud of her daughter and son-in-law&#x27;s efforts to stop the &quot;völkisch&quot; campaign and wrote to Frederick to say she was happy that her daughter had married a man like him, who was prepared to stand up for the rights of the Jews. In both the Kronprinzenpalais and Neues Palais in Potsdam, the crown princely couple received many commoners, including some Jewish personalities, which inevitably led to the disapproval of the emperor and the court. Among their guests were the physicians Hermann von Helmholtz and Rudolf Virchow, the philosopher Eduard Zeller, and the historian Hans Delbrück. The reactionary and anti-Semitic Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee felt so threatened by the prospect of Frederick becoming emperor and Victoria empress that he planned, were Frederick to ascend to the throne, to have the military stage a coup d&#x27;état in favor of his son Prince Wilhelm; to have Victoria expelled back to Britain and to have her executed if she ever returned to Germany; to end universal manhood suffrage for the &quot;Reichstag&quot;; and to have Germany launch a war to &quot;take out&quot; France, Austria, and Russia (the fact that Germany was allied to the last two did not matter to Waldersee). Only the fact that Frederick was already dying of cancer when he become emperor in 1888 kept Waldersee from going ahead with his plans for a &quot;putsch&quot;.

An art lover, Victoria appreciated and practised painting, receiving classes from Anton von Werner and Heinrich von Angeli. She also supported education and was a member of the association founded by Wilhelm Adolf Lette in 1866, whose objective was to improve women&#x27;s education. Beginning in 1877, Victoria founded schools for girls (the &quot;&quot;Victoriaschule für Mädchen&quot;) directed by British teachers, in addition to nursing schools (the &quot;Victoriahaus zur Krankenpflege&quot;&quot;) based on the English model.

===Mother of a large family===

Victoria&#x27;s eldest son went through various treatments to cure his atrophied arm. Strange methods, such as the so-called &quot;animal baths&quot; in which the arm was immersed in the entrails of recently dead rabbits, were performed with some regularity. In addition, William also underwent electroshock sessions in an attempt to revive the nerves passing through the left arm to the neck and also to prevent his head tilting to one side. Victoria insisted that he become a good rider. The thought that he, as heir to the throne, should not be able to ride was intolerable to her. Riding lessons began when William was eight and were a matter of endurance for him. Over and over, the weeping prince was set on his horse and compelled to go through the paces. He fell off time after time but despite his tears was set on its back again. After weeks, he finally got it right and maintained his balance. William later wrote: &quot;The torments inflicted on me, in this pony riding, must be attributed to my mother.&quot;

For Victoria, her son&#x27;s disability was a disgrace. Her letters and her diary show her grief for her son&#x27;s arm and her guilt for having given birth to a disabled child. During a visit to her parents in 1860, she wrote about her eldest son:

Sigmund Freud speculated that Victoria, being unable to accept the illness of her child, distanced herself from her first-born, which made a great impact on the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the she was very affectionate with her children. According to him, she wanted her children to be like the idealised figure of her own father and tried, as best she could, to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria&#x27;s influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and she feared that such education would undermine their values.

Willing to give their children the best education possible, Victoria and her husband entrusted this task to the bright, strict Calvinist philologist Georg Ernst Hinzpeter. Reputedly a liberal, Hinzpeter was in fact a staunch conservative who made William and Henry undergo a rigorous and puritanical upbringing, without praise or incentives. To complete their education, the princes were sent to a school in Kassel despite the opposition of the king and court. Finally, William was enrolled at the University of Bonn, and his younger brother, who did not show the same intellectual interests, was sent to the navy at 16 years old. The education received by the children did not allow them to have the open and liberal personalities that their parents wanted.

While her two eldest sons were approaching adulthood, Victoria suffered another blow with the death of her 11-year-old son, Waldemar, on 27 March 1879 of diphtheria. Without having recovered from the death of Sigismund, the crown princess was devastated with the loss of another child especially since he died of the same disease that had taken her sister Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine and her niece Princess Marie just a few months earlier. Victoria, however, tried to keep her suffering secret because, except for her husband, no other family member was willing to comfort her.

If her sons were sources of great concern, Victoria&#x27;s daughters rarely caused problems. The only exception was Charlotte, the eldest of the princesses. A girl with slow growth and a difficult education, she was regularly prone to fits of rage during her childhood. Growing up, her health became delicate, and in addition to her capricious personality, she also revealed an irritable character. Today, several historians (like John C. G. Röhl, Martin Warren and David Hunt) defend the thesis that Charlotte suffered from porphyria as did her maternal ancestor King George III. This could explain the gastrointestinal problems, migraines and nervous crises that tormented the princess. The same historians believe that the headaches and skin rashes that Victoria treated with doses of morphine were also a consequence of porphyria, albeit in a weaker form than that suffered by Charlotte.

===Matrimonial projects: sources of conflict===

As her children became adults, Victoria began to seek suitors for them. In 1878, Charlotte married her paternal second cousin Bernhard, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen, which delighted the Berlin court. Three years later, Victoria began negotiations to marry William to Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, provoking outrage in conservative German circles. Chancellor Bismarck criticised the project because the princess belonged to the family who was dethroned by Prussia with the annexation of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in 1864. The Hohenzollerns considered Augusta Victoria unworthy to marry the second-in-line to the German Empire because her family lacked sufficient rank. After several months of negotiations, Victoria got what she wanted but soon became disappointed when she saw that her daughter-in-law did not have the liberal personality that she expected.

The crown princess, however, was not so lucky with the marriage plans for her daughter Viktoria. In 1881, she fell in love with Prince Alexander I of Bulgaria and her mother tried to obtain permission from the emperor for the engagement. Despite being a sovereign, the Bulgarian prince was born of a morganatic marriage, which placed him in a position of inferiority in front of the proud House of Hohenzollern. In addition, Alexander&#x27;s policy in his Principality of Bulgaria was greatly disliked by Russia, a traditional ally of Prussia. Bismarck feared that marriage between a German princess and an enemy of Tsar Alexander III of Russia would represent a blow to the League of the Three Emperors, the Austro-German-Russian alliance. The chancellor, in the meanwhile, gained the disapproval of William I to the union, much to the dismay of Victoria and Frederick.

This new conflict between father and son resulted in the emperor replacing the crown prince with Prince William at official ceremonies and major events. On several occasions, it was the grandson of William I who represented the Berlin court abroad.

==German Empress==

===Agony of William I and Frederick III&#x27;s disease===
In 1887, the health of the 90-year-old William I declined rapidly, indicating that the succession was close. However, the crown prince was also ill. Increasingly sickly, Frederick was told that he had laryngeal cancer. To confirm his suspicions, Frederick was examined by British physician Morell Mackenzie, who after a biopsy did not find any sign of illness.

With the agreement of his physicians, Frederick went with his wife to Great Britain for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in June 1887. On that trip, the couple secretly brought to Windsor Castle three boxes full of personal documents that they wanted to keep away from the eyes of Bismarck and the Hohenzollerns. Always eager to harm the crown prince, the imperial chancellor continued his intrigues against Victoria. With the help of Chamberlain Hugo von Radolin and the painter Götz de Seckendorff, he tried to prepare a final report against her.

Because the health of the crown prince did not improve, Mackenzie advised him to go to Italy to undergo treatment. Frederick and Victoria went to San Remo in September 1887, causing outrage in Berlin because, despite the continued deterioration in the emperor&#x27;s health, the couple did not return to the capital. In early November, Frederick completely lost the use of speech, and German doctors were summoned by Victoria to San Remo for further examinations. Finally, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumour, for which the only possible treatment was the removal of his larynx, but the crown prince refused. Victoria supported her husband in his decision, which caused a serious argument with her son William, who shortly before had arrived in Italy and accused his mother of being happy with Frederick&#x27;s disease.

In Berlin, the agony of William I lasted several months until, on 9 March 1888, the first German emperor finally died. His son succeeded him as king of Prussia and German emperor under the name of Frederick III.

===Empress of 99 days===
Immediately after accession, Emperor Frederick III appointed his wife as Lady of the Order of the Black Eagle, the highest order of chivalry in the Kingdom of Prussia. However, after her return to Berlin, she realised that she and her husband in fact were really &quot;shadows ready to be replaced by William&quot;.

Gravely ill, Frederick III limited his political actions to some symbolic measures, such as declaring an amnesty to all political prisoners and the dismissal of the reactionary Interior Minister Robert von Puttkamer. He also awarded the Order of the Black Eagle to various people who had supported and advised him when he was still crown prince, like Justice Minister Heinrich von Friedberg and Frankfurt Parliament President Eduard von Simson.

Victoria tried to use her new status to promote the marriage of her daughter Viktoria to Prince Alexander I of Bulgaria (abandoned since 1886). However, given the difficulties caused by the project, she advised her daughter to give up on the marriage.

===Death of Frederick III and consequences===
Frederick III died about 11:00 on 15 June 1888. Once the emperor&#x27;s death was announced, his son and successor William II ordered the occupation of the imperial residence by soldiers. The chambers of Frederick and Victoria were carefully checked for incriminating documents. However, the search was unsuccessful because all the couple&#x27;s correspondence had been taken to Windsor Castle the previous year. Several years later, William II stated that the purpose of this research was to find state documents. Currently, however, many historians (as Hannah Pakula and Franz Herre) suggest that what the emperor wanted was to recover documents that could threaten his reputation.

The funeral of Frederick III came shortly after in Potsdam, without major pomp. Victoria, now empress dowager, didn&#x27;t appear at the ceremony in the Friedenskirche of Sanssouci, but attended a mass in memory of her husband at the Bornstedt Crown Estate. From the death of her husband, she became known as Empress Frederick, as her mother-in-law, empress dowager Augusta, was still alive until 1890.

In the following weeks, William II purged all institutions and people close to his parents. The home of the lawyer Franz von Roggenbach was searched and the widow of Ernst von Stockmar, Empress Frederick&#x27;s former private secretary, was questioned by the police. Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken, Frederick III&#x27;s counsellor for years, was tried for high treason for publishing excerpts from the diary of Emperor Frederick. Finally, Heinrich von Friedberg was dismissed as Justice Minister.

==Empress dowager==
===Resettlement===

Once widowed, Empress Frederick had to leave the Neues Palais in Potsdam because her son wanted to settle his residence there. Unable to settle in Sanssouci, she acquired a property in Kronberg im Taunus, in the old Duchy of Nassau. There, she built a castle that was named Friedrichshof in honour of her husband. Having inherited several million marks after the death of the wealthy Maria de Brignole-Sale, Duchess of Galliera, the empress dowager was able to finance the construction and expansion of her residence. With the completion of the works in 1894, she spent most of the year in the property with her younger daughters, and left only when she travelled abroad. Contrary to the desires of the emperor, who preferred that she leave Germany permanently, Empress Frederick formed her own court and maintained close relations with liberal circles.

===Solitude===

In October 1889, Princess Sophia, the empress dowager&#x27;s penultimate daughter, married the future King Constantine I of Greece, leaving the maternal residence. The following year, Princess Viktoria, after the ending of her hopes to wed the ruler of Bulgaria, in the end married Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe, the future regent of the Principality of Lippe. Finally, in 1893, Princess Margaret married Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, who in 1918 was elected to the throne of the ephemeral Kingdom of Finland. Although satisfied with these marriages, the empress dowager felt increasingly isolated following the departure of her daughters.

In fact, Empress Frederick was completely sequestered from public life by Wilhelm II. With the death of her mother-in-law, Empress Dowager Augusta in 1890, Empress Frederick had hopes to succeed her as patron of the German Red Cross and the &quot;Vaterländischer Frauenverein&quot; (Association of Patriotic Women). However, it was her daughter-in-law, Empress Augusta Victoria, who assumed the presidency of these entities, which caused a deep bitterness in Empress Frederick.

The empress dowager did not hesitate to harshly criticise the policies and behaviour of her son. When the emperor wrote in the guestbook of the city of Munich the words &quot;Suprema lex regis voluntas&quot; (The will of the king is the supreme law&quot;), she indignantly wrote to her mother:

===Later years and death===

Empress Frederick devoted part of her final years to painting and to visiting the artists&#x27; colony of Kronberg, where she regularly met with the painter Norbert Schrödl. In her last days, she used to walk in the morning and spent long hours writing letters or reading in the library of her castle.

In late 1898, physicians diagnosed the empress dowager with inoperable breast cancer, forcing her to stay in bed for long periods. Cancer had spread to her spine by the autumn of 1900, and as she worried about her personal letters (in which she detailed her concern over Germany&#x27;s future under her son) falling into the hands of the emperor, she requested that the letters be brought back to Great Britain in a cloak-and-dagger operation by her godson Frederick Ponsonby, the private secretary of her brother, Edward VII, who was making his final visit to his terminally ill sister in Kronberg on 23 February 1901. These letters were later edited by Ponsonby and put into context by his background commentary to form the book that was published in 1928.
The empress dowager died in Friedrichshof on 5 August 1901, less than seven months after the death of her mother.
Empress Frederick was buried next to her husband in the royal mausoleum of the Friedenskirche at Potsdam on 13 August 1901. Her tomb has a recumbent marble effigy of herself on top. Her two sons who died in childhood, Sigismund and Waldemar, are buried in the same mausoleum.

<text>The Sweetest Thing is a 2002 American romantic comedy film directed by Roger Kumble and written by Nancy Pimental, who based the characters on herself and friend Kate Walsh. It stars Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate, and Selma Blair. The film was released on April 12, 2002 and received negative reviews from critics. However, according to screenwriter Nancy Pimental, the film later went on to gain a cult following.

==Plot==
A group of men are interviewed regarding Christina Walters; they consider her a player and a user of men in the swinging singles market. She is a 28-year-old successful interior designer living in San Francisco near North Beach.

Christina meets up with her friend Courtney Rockcliffe, a divorce lawyer. They console their friend and roommate Jane, who had recently broken up with her boyfriend, by taking her out to a dance club. Jane feels out of place, so Christina grabs a man named Peter to set Jane up with, but he berates Christina for her methods and leaves her standing there. While in the bathroom with Courtney, she refers to him by name, leading her to suspect that he got under Christina&#x27;s skin and she is actually in love with him, which she denies.

After running into Peter again, Christina buys him a drink and they spend time together. He explains that he will be attending a wedding on Saturday, and that he is at the club with his obnoxious, womanizing brother Roger to celebrate. He invites Christina and Courtney to an after-party at their hotel, but Christina goes home and later regrets not going.

The next day, while having lunch with Courtney, Christina cannot stop talking about Peter, while Jane pays an embarrassing visit to the dry cleaner. Courtney arranges for Christina and herself to travel to Somerset, where Peter&#x27;s brother&#x27;s wedding is to take place, and they meet Jane&#x27;s boyfriend, whom she previously met at the club. After they leave in Courtney&#x27;s Saab 9-5, Christina and Courtney go on a series of misadventures including an exploding toilet, a glory hole discovery, and a motorcyclist who is led to believe Courtney is receiving cunnilingus from Christina while driving.

Meanwhile, Jane encounters her boyfriend at her retail job and is nearly caught having sex with him in a changing room. When Christina and Courtney finally arrive in Somerset, they visit a store to replace their wet and ruined clothes, only to come out in extremely gaudy, indiscreet outfits. When they arrive at the wedding, Christina begins having second thoughts, but a series of coincidences, including a chance conversation with the bride, causes her to have a change of heart, and they attend. However, they discover that it is Peter, not Roger, who is getting married, and the pair nearly ruin the ceremony in their attempt to escape. Peter and his fiancée then decide that they do not want to marry each other and they call off the wedding.

Christina and Courtney return home and help Jane get out of a sexual situation with her boyfriend where the emergency crew was called in. Sometime later, Courtney is dating a doctor and is clearly very attracted to him, and Christina is back to a newly unfulfilled life of being single again. Later, Peter finds Christina&#x27;s address in the log at the store they bought their clothes in and tracks her down. Christina, determined not to fear the commitment, kisses Peter and then walks away disappointed.

Peter is interviewed like the men at the beginning of the film, retelling his version of the events calling Christina a bitch and a player, but ultimately reveals that he and Christina are together, having gotten married and are living very happily with Jane, Courtney and Roger as well.
